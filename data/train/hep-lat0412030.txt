    "@xcite are encouraging for the use of `` rooted '' staggered quarks , there is one disturbing feature : the chiral and continuum limits of @xmath1 do not commute .",
    "if the continuum limit is taken first , the known continuum result is reproduced .",
    "but if the chiral limit is first taken for the staggered quarks , the continuum limit then disagrees with the exact result .",
    "this leads to three key questions :    * do similar singularities appear in 4d qcd with staggered fermions ? *",
    "if they do appear , do such singularities induce uncontrolled systematic errors in the results reported in , refs .",
    "* are the singularities the result of the rooting procedure ?    here , i address these questions for 4d qcd in the context of staggered chiral perturbation theory ( ) @xcite .",
    "in , singular quantities for which the chiral and continuum limits fail to commute can easily be found in the quenched or partially quenched cases . as explained in , the way the noncommutativity comes about",
    "is simple : taste violations split the masses of mesons , and the splitting becomes the dominant effect in the meson masses as the chiral limit is approached .",
    "when the physics is particularly sensitive to the chiral regime , the chiral and continuum limits do not commute . quenching or partial quenching leads to such sensitivity through double poles in neutral meson propagators , which enhance the infrared ( ir ) regime in loop diagrams . in the context of",
    ", the lack of commutativity has nothing directly to do with the issue of taking the root of the staggered determinant , and occurs in normal , `` unrooted , '' staggered theories also .    in",
    ", i discuss the issue of commutativity of limits for unquenched  ( `` full ' ' ) . defining safe quantities as those for which the chiral and continuum limits commute",
    ", i argue that most standard physical quantities are safe because the full theory has no double poles and is therefore better behaved in the ir . in this sense",
    "it is very similar to full continuum chiral perturbation theory ( ) . the safe quantities include those commonly determined in simulations , such as @xmath2 or the ratio of squared goldstone meson mass to quark mass .",
    "however , the shorthand statement `` standard quantities are safe '' is misleading , since is in fact simple to write down other quantities for which the limits do not commute in full .",
    "a rough guide is that quantities that are finite in the chiral limit of full , continuum  are likely to be safe in this sense , although this guide itself has exceptions . furthermore , there is at this point no proof , but only an intuitive argument for why the singularities are absent to all orders for the standard quantities in the full case .",
    "however , as discussed in , even if one assumes that the argument breaks down and singularities actually appear at some higher order , the associated new errors in previously computed quantities would be negligible .    finally , in , i mention two other examples of lack of commutativity , one with wilson fermions and one in the quenched 2d schwinger model .",
    "i point out that the known examples seem to indicate that the rooting procedure and the commutativity issues are independent .",
    "i conclude with a discussion of whether noncommutativity might be seen in topological and @xmath3 physics in 4d .",
    "the simplest example of noncommutativity of limits in  occurs in the quenched pion mass , where the `` pion '' is made of two degenerate valence quarks of mass @xmath4 . in continuum",
    "quenched , we have at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) @xcite : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the chiral scale ; @xmath7 , the contribution to the @xmath3 mass from the anomaly ; @xmath8 , the decay constant normalized so that @xmath9 ; and @xmath10 , the tree - level pion mass squared , @xmath11 .",
    "( @xmath12 is a constant with dimensions of mass . )",
    "the @xmath13 represents less singular terms that do not lead to noncommutativity of limits . here , and",
    "throughout this paper , i work in the infinite volume limit for simplicity .",
    "the corresponding expression for the goldstone pion in  is @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the squared tree - level mass of the taste - singlet pion , @xmath16 with @xmath17 the splitting of the taste - singlet pion from the goldstone pion . in the neglected terms",
    "include effects of the taste - violating hairpins @xcite .",
    "these are suppressed by @xmath18 and cause no problems with the limits .",
    "taking the ratio of lattice to continuum results , we have , to this order , @xmath19 this ratio clearly goes to 1 if we take the continuum limit , @xmath20 , first .",
    "but it blows up if the chiral limit ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) is taken first , because the staggered theory gives the wrong answer in this case .",
    "of course  breaks down once the correction term gets large . in this case",
    "the breakdown occurs because of the `` quenched chiral log '' in the continuum .",
    "the logarithm is cut off in the staggered theory by the taste splitting , @xmath17 .",
    "this quenched example makes my basic point , but it is not very similar to the effect seen in ref .",
    "@xcite . there ,",
    "the staggered theory is found to give a finite result for either order of the limits @xmath21 and @xmath20 ; it is just that the result is incorrect ( different from the continuum ) when @xmath21 is taken first .",
    "an example that has this kind of behavior can be found in the partially quenched 4d theory .    for simplicity ,",
    "i take @xmath23 degenerate sea quarks of mass @xmath24 in the partially quenched theory , and again consider a pion made from degenerate valence quarks of mass @xmath4 . in the continuum ,",
    "the pion mass at nlo is @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 , and @xmath13 represents analytic terms .    in the staggered case ,",
    "consider @xmath27 degenerate dynamical staggered fields with mass @xmath24 .",
    "i define @xmath23 here as the number of sea quarks in the continuum limit : @xmath28 if the fourth root of the determinant is taken ; while @xmath29 if it is not .",
    "the result has the same form when written in terms of @xmath23 , whether or not the root is taken . putting sea and valence quarks separately",
    "degenerate in eq .",
    "( 48 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , one easily arrives at the one - loop mass of the goldstone pion : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is defined analogously to @xmath32 , , and @xmath13 represents analytic terms and the effects of taste - violating hairpins , which again cause no problem with the limits .",
    "if the continuum limit is taken first , reproduces , so the two will give identical results no matter how the chiral limit is subsequently taken .",
    "on the other hand , if first we take the valence chiral limit ( @xmath21 , with @xmath24 fixed ) , the lack of commutativity of limits exactly parallels the quenched case , with @xmath33 playing the role of @xmath7 . as before ,",
    "@xmath34 terms in the staggered theory cut off a chiral log that is divergent in the continuum theory .    for my purposes ,",
    "a more interesting chiral limit occurs when @xmath4 and @xmath24 both approach 0 , but with @xmath24 vanishing much more slowly , so that @xmath35 as @xmath36 , with @xmath37 a positive constant . in this limit ( with @xmath38 fixed in the staggered case ) @xmath39 where @xmath13 represents additional @xmath40 or @xmath34 terms , coming from taste - violating hairpins or taste - violating analytic terms .",
    "if we now take the continuum limit , @xmath41 in disagreement with . on the other hand , the staggered theory clearly reproduces if the continuum limit is taken first in .",
    "note that the noncommutativity of limits has nothing to do with the fourth - root prescription , and has exactly the same form with or without the fourth root .",
    "of course , for fixed number @xmath27 of dynamical staggered fields , the effective number of continuum sea quarks @xmath23 depends on whether the root is taken , so we could say in that sense that the rooting prescription trivially affects the the strength of the singularity , but not its existence .",
    "the lack of commutativity of limits appears in the computed one - loop   quantities @xcite only in the quenched or partially quenched cases , which are enhanced in the ir relative to the full case and therefore especially sensitive to the chiral limit .",
    "this is due to the double pole structure that shows up in flavor - neutral meson propagators . in the full qcd case ,",
    "there are only single poles , and i therefore do not expect noncommutativity to be generic in this case .",
    "for example , if we first go to full qcd ( @xmath42 ; @xmath43 ) in , the nlo corrections then always vanish in the subsequent @xmath44 , @xmath45 limits , independent of their order .",
    "the absence of the commutativity problem in most full qcd quantities seems to be a general feature of .",
    "it is equivalent to the statement that the limit @xmath44 at fixed @xmath38 is smooth in full , that there are no ir divergences on shell in this limit .",
    "i believe this to be the case because , taking the additional limit @xmath20 , one recovers the massless continuum .",
    "ordinary chiral power counting in this limit shows that ir divergences are absent : the derivative couplings suppress ir contributions and make loop effects finite even in the presence of massless particles .",
    "if we now turn on the lattice - dependent ( @xmath34 and higher ) vertices of , these act as effective mass terms and should not induce ir divergences that were previously absent .",
    "power counting applied to  then implies that any logarithms of @xmath18 that appear in the @xmath44 limit are `` protected '' by powers of @xmath18 , so they cause no problem in the subsequent @xmath20 limit .    full  in the chiral limit is in fact closely analogous to full continuum  with massless up and down quarks but a nonvanishing strange quark mass . in both cases there",
    "are terms giving mass to some , but not all , of the pseudoscalar mesons : the pions remain massless in the continuum example ; while the taste-@xmath46 ( goldstone ) meson remains massless in . and in both cases the mass or mass - like terms give rise to interactions lacking enough derivatives to suppress all ir divergences automatically . yet",
    ", one expects no ir divergences in the continuum case as the strange quark mass turns on , and therefore i expect  to be likewise well - behaved .",
    "however , a detailed proof that the chiral limit of full  is `` safe '' may be rather delicate . although the lattice - dependent vertices give no nonderivative interactions purely among the taste-@xmath46 mesons @xcite ( the analogous statement is also true in the continuum example ) , potential problems may arise when external non - goldstone mesons ( taste different from @xmath46 ) scatter to give massless @xmath46 mesons in internal loops .    as a simple example , consider massless  theory with two flavors , and take only the coefficient @xmath47 in the taste - violating , @xmath34 , potential @xcite to be nonzero .",
    "this is sufficient to give mass to all the non - goldstone mesons .",
    "now consider the contribution shown in to the scattering of two taste - singlet , flavor charged , mesons through the exchange of taste-@xmath46 mesons . if the two vertices come from the @xmath47 term , then there are no derivatives on the internal lines to suppress the logarithmic ir divergence . on shell , the momentum transfer through the loop will , in the generic case , provide a cutoff .",
    "however , with @xmath47 vertices , there is an ir divergence in this diagram in the forward direction , @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "the divergence is canceled by the diagrams with one or both of the vertices replaced by kinetic energy vertices .",
    "the terms in the kinetic energy vertices where the derivatives act on the external lines provide the cancellation , possible because @xmath48 implies @xmath50 .",
    "terms where the derivatives act on the internal lines are clearly not ir divergent ; neither is the corresponding `` s - channel '' diagram ( on shell ) . though the result of this example is positive ( no ir divergence on shell )",
    ", it also shows some of the issues that would need to be addressed in a complete proof that full  is safe .",
    "a further subtlety is the following : when i suggest that full  is `` safe , ''",
    "i really only mean that certain standard quantities are safe , they have commuting chiral and continuum limits .",
    "a sufficient number of derivatives ( with respect to quark mass ) of any safe quantity will certainly produce ir divergences and hence lack of commutativity of limits .",
    "which quantities are likely to be safe ?",
    "the above arguments suggest that quantities that are free of ir divergences in the chiral limit of full continuum  will probably be safe in .",
    "this means , for example , that pseudoscalar masses and decay constants as computed in @xcite will be safe . on the other hand",
    ", a quantity like the pion charge radius , which is defined in terms of an external current with nonvanishing momentum transfer , is ir divergent in the continuum chiral limit @xcite .",
    "the charge radius is therefore almost certain to have the wrong chiral limit at fixed @xmath38 in ; it should indeed behave much the same way as the quenched @xmath51 , .",
    "furthermore , since in the continuum one can differentiate the squared meson mass once with respect to the quark mass and still have a finite quantity in the chiral limit , i expect that the corresponding quantities in  are safe . for the squared goldstone ( taste @xmath46 ) mass",
    "this is fairly obvious from the exact lattice @xmath52 ; one can also divide by ( instead of differentiating with respect to ) the quark mass , as in the full  version of .",
    "it is less obvious that one can differentiate the squared masses of non - goldstone ( taste other than @xmath46 ) mesons and still have a safe quantity .",
    "for example , how do we know that a term like @xmath53 can not appear in the squared non - goldstone masses ?",
    "such terms are not divergent as @xmath44 , but their derivatives are divergent , which would lead to noncommutativity .",
    "a one - loop calculation , similar to the scattering calculation described above , shows that such terms do in fact cancel for the taste - singlet mass .",
    "whether this really persists beyond one loop remains to be seen .",
    "note that dividing a squared non - goldstone mass by quark mass , rather than differentiating , is certainly _ unsafe _ , as is already clear at tree - level , .",
    "this shows why it is difficult to write down a simple rule that distinguishes safe from unsafe quantities in all cases . on the other hand , if we limit ourselves only to goldstone mesons on the external lines , then it appears that  quantities will be safe if the corresponding quantities in full continuum  are finite in the chiral limit .",
    "drr and hoelbling @xcite worry that the possible noncommutativity of limits with staggered fermions would induce new , uncontrolled , errors in the previously reported results with milc staggered configurations @xcite . to the extent that  describes the milc simulations , we can argue that such errors are not present  even in the absence of a detailed proof that full  is safe to all orders .",
    "that is because the extraction of physical results requires extrapolation only to the physical light quark masses , not to the chiral limit .",
    "the factor @xmath54 is of order 3 or 4 at the physical point ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "even should the logarithm not be `` protected '' by powers of @xmath56 in some higher order of  and represent a divergence in the chiral limit at fixed @xmath38 , it would still be suppressed , numerically , by the additional powers of @xmath18 at that order . by looking at the numerics of the calculations in refs .",
    "@xcite , it is not hard to convince oneself that any new errors would most likely be significantly smaller than the already - quoted systematic errors .",
    "as an example , consider the case of @xmath2 .",
    "imagine that there is in fact an `` unsafe '' contribution at nnlo ( next - to - next - to - leading order ) , of order @xmath57 . to estimate its size ,",
    "define the dimensionless taste - violating chiral expansion parameter @xmath58 by @xcite @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a `` typical '' taste - violating term at @xmath34 .",
    "taking for @xmath60 the average pion splitting , gives @xmath61 on the milc coarse lattices and @xmath62 on the fine lattices .",
    "then i would expect the putative nnlo unsafe contribution to be generated by a term of size @xmath63 where the sum is over all @xmath64 pion tastes , labeled by @xmath65 .",
    "the unsafe contribution comes from the goldstone pion in the sum .",
    "note that i assume that the goldstone pion appears only through such an average over tastes .",
    "that seems very likely , since the diagrams that distinguish separate tastes are diagrams with disconnected internal pion propagators , which at nlo occur just for the singlet , axial , and vector tastes . at nnlo there",
    "could be disconnected internal goldstone lines , but it is known @xcite that such contributions come with an extra factor of @xmath66 , making them safe . putting in @xmath67 and the values of @xmath58",
    "gives an unsafe contribution of @xmath68 on the coarse lattices and @xmath69 on the fine lattices .",
    "these are clearly much smaller than other systematic errors ( which are @xmath70 for @xmath2 and @xmath71 for @xmath72 ) , even without taking into account the fact that some of the error would be removed by the continuum extrapolation ( linear in @xmath73 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    of course",
    ", there would also be systematic errors coming from contributions of the other taste pions in",
    ". however , these contributions are safe , with commuting chiral and continuum limits .",
    "the associated errors are therefore standard higher order  errors , and as such are already included in the error estimates of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "note that my error estimate assumes that the `` worst case '' would be the existence of a singularity in full  that would interfere with the extrapolation to the physical light quark masses .",
    "this is reasonable despite the fact that intermediate stages in the analysis in refs .",
    "@xcite often involve fits to partially quenched lattice data , where we know that noncommutativity of limits does occur .",
    "the point is that the relevant nlo formulas such as are known .",
    "we fit lattice data to them in a range of valence and sea masses that are far from the singularities . since the light quark masses in the data are always more than a factor of three larger than the physical masses , the logarithms and the nonlinearities associated with them are always significantly smaller than at the physical point .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that ( as checked directly in the calculations ) the nlo corrections in the fits are under control and of the expected magnitude . if unexpected new singularities were to occur in higher order , the resulting errors in the partially quenched fits would be smaller than those induced in the subsequent full  extrapolation , simply because the logarithms are smaller .    of course , if the staggered simulations had some additional noncommutativity of limits not captured by   having to do , say , with the fourth - root procedure  then an uncontrolled systematic error might in fact be present in the milc results .",
    "however , recent advances in understanding the rooting procedure @xcite , coupled with the good fit of milc data @xcite to  predictions @xcite , make such a possibility seem increasingly unlikely .",
    "the lack of commutativity of the chiral and continuum limits is not exclusively a property of staggered fermions . for wilson fermions",
    ", it appears at one loop in a power counting for which @xmath74 and @xmath34 are treated as comparable @xcite . at this order ,",
    "a term of the form @xmath53 is present in the squared meson mass in the full qcd case .",
    "( the corresponding partially quenched case has not to my knowledge been studied . ) after differentiating with respect to ( or dividing by ) the quark mass , such a term leads to an ir divergence as @xmath44 for fixed @xmath38 ; whereas it clearly vanishes if the @xmath20 limit is taken first .",
    "the source of problem is the absence of an exact chiral symmetry in the massless limit .",
    "this means that massless wilson pions can interact without derivative couplings @xcite , leading to ir singularities and failure of commutativity .",
    "note that the wilson case is significantly worse than the staggered case : in the latter , self - interactions of the massless goldstone ( taste @xmath46 ) pion are always proportional to at least two powers of momentum . at finite @xmath38",
    ", the non - goldstone staggered pions are not required to have derivative interactions , but neither are they massless .",
    "my  examples and certainly the wilson case suggest that lack of commutativity has little or nothing to do with the rooting procedure .",
    "is this also true of the 2d schwinger models studied in ref .",
    "the physics of the one - flavor 2d schwinger model @xmath1 , where the noncommutativity is found , is quite distinct from the multiflavor 4d chiral theories discussed above . with one flavor ,",
    "the `` condensate '' comes about because of the symmetry is violated by the anomaly , not because of spontaneous symmetry breaking . in the continuum , the anomaly leads to exact zero modes of the dirac operator , which in turn saturate @xmath1 .",
    "since staggered fermions have only near zero modes in complex pairs , their effect cancels in the @xmath44 limit , and @xmath1 vanishes for fixed @xmath38 . if the continuum limit is taken first , however , the complex pair of near zero modes becomes a pair of degenerate exact zero modes , and the rooting prescription works as desired , producing a single exact mode .",
    "( see refs .",
    "@xcite for details . ) since the physics here is inextricably tied to having only one flavor , however , it is not possible to separate cleanly the issues of the lack of commutativity and the rooting procedure within this model .    in the two - flavor 2d schwinger model ,",
    "on the other hand , the rooting procedure is not required , yet i suspect that it would be possible to find noncommutativity in the masses of the `` quasi - goldstone bosons , '' of a similar nature to that seen in quenched or partially quenched 4d  ( ) . that is because integration over a single ( boson ) pole in 2d has the same ir behavior as integration over a double pole in 4d .",
    "the problem here is that there is no true condensate in 2d , so there is no simple chiral theory : @xmath1 and the quasi - goldstone boson squared masses vanish as fractional powers of @xmath75 as @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "it is therefore a nontrivial problem to discover an analogue of  that would allow one to calculate the discretization effects caused by staggered fermions .",
    "thus i am not able at this point to make a specific proposal for where to look for noncommutativity in this model .",
    "a simple alternative to the two - flavor theory in this context can be found in the quenched 2d schwinger model , which does not require the rooting procedure either ( trivially ) .",
    "reference  @xcite studies the quenched theory with staggered fermions , but since @xmath1 blows up as @xmath76 in the continuum , it is hard to see any noncommutativity cleanly .",
    "recently , drr and hoelbling have looked instead at @xmath77 ( @xmath78 is the coupling ) for staggered fermions @xcite .",
    "they find clear evidence that the chiral and continuum limits do not commute for this quantity .",
    "in addition , the behavior is is very similar , qualitatively , to that observed for @xmath1 in the one - flavor schwinger model . at the least",
    ", this shows that noncommutativity of limits is not inextricably tied to the rooting procedure in these 2d models .",
    "finally , one may wonder whether there are order - of - limits problems in 4d that are directly analogous to those in the one - flavor 2d schwinger model , and not of the kind treated above in .",
    "for example , in qcd with a single flavor , the value of @xmath1 in the chiral limit is probably crucially dependent on having exact zero modes @xcite , just as it is in 2d , leading to noncommuting chiral and continuum limits . in normal ,",
    "multiflavor qcd , however , i know of no standard physical quantities that have this kind of sensitivity to the existence of exact zero modes .",
    "for example , the topological susceptibility seems to be well - behaved , both in  @xcite and in simulations @xcite .",
    "this is not to say that the staggered discretization errors are negligible  indeed they are large .",
    "but there is no commutativity problem ; the continuum suppression of the susceptibility seems to be present whether one takes the chiral or continuum limit first .",
    "similarly , i do not expect any problem in the qcd @xmath3 mass .",
    "because of the anomaly , the @xmath3 mass is generated through disconnected meson diagrams @xcite . in the continuum limit ,",
    "staggered fermions have the correct anomaly ( for infinitesimal chiral rotations ) @xcite , and this should be adjusted correctly by the fourth - root procedure , since the anomaly is essentially perturbative . at finite lattice spacing , i expect that  will correctly capture the modifications in the @xmath3 physics due to staggered fermions , at least at vacuum angle @xmath79 , , the issue is not simply one of commutativity of limits , but whether staggered fermions can get the correct physics at all .",
    "this is related to the fact that the staggered anomalous symmetry involves a lattice translation and can not be exponentiated to trade a phase in the quark mass matrix for @xmath80 .",
    "for example , the known cp - violating phase can not be reproduced by a simulation with an odd number of negative mass staggered quarks . ] just as ordinary  correctly captures @xmath3 physics in the continuum @xcite .",

    "i also thank oliver br , maarten golterman , jim hetrick , gautam rupak , and steve sharpe for many helpful comments and suggestions .",
