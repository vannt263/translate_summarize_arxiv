    "building from the techniques developed in optics , quantum measurement is now being explored for non - classical state preparation of matter - based systems such as atomic spin ensembles and the motion of mechanical resonators . for atomic ensembles ,",
    "spin squeezing by measurement is now an established technique  @xcite and very recently heralded single quanta addition has been employed to generate non - gaussian states  @xcite with significant wigner negativity  @xcite . in optomechanics , squeezing of a mechanical quadrature of motion can be achieved deterministically by using a parametric modulation , which has been used to demonstrate squeezing of thermal motion  @xcite . alternatively , squeezing can be achieved by a back - action evading measurement such as a stroboscopic  @xcite or two - toned measurement  @xcite .",
    "pulsed interactions also allow for cooling and squeezing by measurement as well as quantum state tomography  @xcite , and can be used in sequence to generate a quantum optomechanical interface  @xcite .",
    "though much of the current focus of optomechanics is on linear interactions and measurement , non - guassian operations are now also being explored by conditioning on single photon counting . by analogy to heralded single photon generation using parametric down - conversion in optics , a cavity optomechanical scheme for heralded single phonon addition and subtraction by single photon detection was proposed in ref .",

    "single photon counting was used to generate a non - classical state of motion of the terahertz frequency lattice vibration in a diamond crystal  @xcite and experimental progress in optomechanics using single photon detection has very recently been made  @xcite .",
    "state generation by quantum measurement is also very useful for multi - mode quantum state engineering . indeed , using a single photon detection event , entanglement between the vibrational states of two diamond crystals has been generated  @xcite , and techniques for mechanical @xmath3 state generation have been proposed  @xcite , as well as schemes to entangle atomic ensembles with mechanical motion  @xcite .",
    "in addition , a scheme has been recently proposed that utilises an optomechanical interaction with a non - classical optical field prepared via photon subtraction to conditionally generate non - classical mechanical states  @xcite .    unlike optical fields , massive bosonic systems are often incoherently excited due to their lower resonance frequency .",
    "for example , mechanical oscillators can undergo thermal brownian motion , and spin ensembles may have imperfect spin polarization .",

    "it is evident that the operation @xmath113 gives the deepest negativity .",
    "this is because performing a quadrature measurement first purifies the state before the negativity is generated by the phonon addition operation .",
    "if instead phonon subtraction is performed after the quadrature measurement , i.e. , case @xmath112 , then we see that the measurement strength must exceed a threshold for wigner negativity to be generated .",

    "optimal fidelity with a cat state also has one important qualitative difference to both wigner negativity and non - classical depth : pronounced non - monotonicity . as @xmath128",
    "all cases converge to the same non - vanishing value , and as @xmath129 the optimal fidelity with a cat state vanishes .",
    "however , in between these limits the various cases separate and many attain a maximum for non - vanishing @xmath28 .",
    "this general behaviour is indicative of an extra competition with the fact that the overlap of the peaks with a cat state decreases as the squeezing or effective squeezing increases .",

    "for a finesse of @xmath145 this gives a cavity decay rate 100 times larger than @xmath5 thus allowing for rapid position measurements .",

    "we would also like to note that a qnd position measurement can also be implemented with a two - toned drive on this longrt cavity  @xcite , which offers an alternate route to implement our scheme using a single cavity .",
    "importantly , the mechanical oscillator should be cyrogenically cooled to minimise thermal decoherence . with cryogenic cooling to @xmath150  mk",
    ", the mechanical oscillator will have a thermal occupation of @xmath151 , and so some simple laser precooling  @xcite can be employed by driving the red sideband of the longer cavity before implementing our protocol .",

    "thermal decoherence smooths the phase - space distribution of the quantum state prepared and reduces any non - classicality .",
    "we have quantified and discussed this effect in more detail in appendix  [ sec : thermalheating ] , which can be readily incorporated into the mathematical framework used here .",
    "it should also be noted that the precise linear measurements utilised here also provide a route to perform quantum state reconstruction  @xcite by measurement of the mechanical quadrature marginals .",
    "building on the success of non - classical state generation via squeezing and photon addition and subtraction in optics we propose and analyze the use of qnd quadrature measurements in combination with single quanta addition and subtraction .",
    "this opens an avenue to generate non - classical states in massive bosonic systems , such as the motion of mechanical oscillators and spin - ensembles . unlike optical fields , experiments in such systems",
    "face the challenge of initial thermal occupation , and it is a non - trivial task to identify which permutation of qnd quadrature measurement and single photon addition or subtraction generates the strongest non - classicality .",
    "a key advantage of using measurement instead of squeezing is that it provides purification in addition to squeezing , thus offering more resilience to initial thermal occupation . indeed , of the eight cases we have considered here , we find that the operation @xmath153 provides the strongest wigner negativity , maximises the non - classical depth , and attains the largest optimal fidelity with a cat state .",
    "our scheme can be immediately applied in atomic spin ensemble and optomechanics experiments where it can be useful for the development of quantum technologies , e.g. , quantum sensing , and for probing fundamental physics by empirically studying decoherence mechanisms .",

    "during our protocol , coupling of the system of interest to its surrounding thermal bath will cause an inevitable amount of decoherence . this has the effect of smoothing the phase - space distribution and reducing any negativity or non - classicality . in this appendix",
    "we discuss how this effect can be quantified using our framework .    of the operations in our scheme , addition or subtraction , @xmath46 , takes by far the longest time to perform .",
    "as described in ref .",
    "@xcite this operation is achieved in the resolved sideband regime and requires an interaction time of many mechanical periods ( of order 100 ) . by contrast , a quadrature measurement , @xmath1 , is performed over a timescale which is much shorter than a mechanical period .",
    "thus , the principal contribution of thermal decoherence will occur during the action of @xmath46 and we neglect decoherence during @xmath1 .",
    "the mechanical rethermalisation rate is @xmath233 ( @xmath234 : thermal occupation of the bath ; @xmath235 : mechanical damping rate ) and thus a useful dimensionless constant is @xmath236 , which approximates the decoherence per mechanical period ( @xmath29 : mechanical quality factor ) .",
    "we may therefore quantify the thermal decoherence during the action of @xmath46 as @xmath237the number of thermal quanta ` added ' during @xmath46 , where @xmath238 is the interaction time in mechanical periods and is of order 100 as described above .",
    "clearly , we require @xmath239 in order for our protocol to generate non - classicality . we have discussed in the main text that for modest experimental parameters one may achieve @xmath240 , for which this condition is satisfied .",
    "the formalism we employ readily affords a simple model of thermal decoherence . since the decoherence due to thermal heating",
    "is assumed to be small we may treat it as a perturbation to the ideal evolution that effects @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , the evolution may be separated and the full dynamics approximated by first applying @xmath46 and then performing partial rethermalisation by ` adding ' @xmath241 thermal quanta .",
    "the operation that describes adding @xmath241 thermal quanta to some state @xmath31 is  @xcite @xmath242 ( one may derive this by adiabatically eliminating the bath , treating the decoherence as a perturbation , and finally assuming that the thermal occupation of the bath is much greater than unity , which allows the bath to be treated classically ) . for the @xmath34-function that represents @xmath31 , this becomes a convolution with a gaussian of variance @xmath243 .",
    "hence , @xmath244 ( this observation is in fact the motivation for interpreting the non - classical depth as the average number of thermal quanta required to eliminate negativity . ) thus , the formalism used here with the @xmath34-function allows one to readily incorporate thermal heating into expressions such as eqs .   and  .",
    "considering , for example , the case @xmath130 , the effect of a non - vanishing @xmath241 is simply to smoothen the phase - space distribution , and reduce the non - classical depth by @xmath241 .",
    "it should be noted that we have omitted the ( classical ) component of the momentum transfer due to the mean photon number per pulse .",
    "this effect can be easily cancelled by a number of methods including applying an opposing force by , say , a piezo , or using a sequence of two pulsed measurements separated by half a period of mechanical motion .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for a derivation and further discussion of this operator .",
    "one might think that feedback could be used to displace the mechanical state back to the origin and thereby avoid the use of a window .",
    "this works if the quadrature measurement is performed before addition or subtraction  cases @xmath245but if addition or subtraction comes first then the resulting state would be asymmetric and such feedback can not be used ."
