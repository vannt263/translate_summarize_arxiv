    "sandpile models are the best known examples of self - organized criticality ( soc ) @xcite , in which the dynamics of a system forces it to the critical point of an absorbing - state phase transition @xcite leading to scale - invariance in the apparent absence of tunable parameters @xcite .",
    "the soc state can be attributed to the presence of two well separated time scales @xcite , one corresponding to the external energy input or driving force , and the other to the microscopic evolution ( e.g. , avalanches ) .",
    "the separation between the two times scales ( also called _",
    "slow driving _ ) effectively tunes the system to the neighborhood of an absorbing - state phase transition ; the latter transition is reached in the usual manner , by adjusting a control parameter , in models known as _ conserved sandpiles _ ( cs ) or _ fixed - energy sandpiles _",
    "the cs has the same local dynamics as the corresponding driven sandpile , but a fixed number of particles .",
    "it is characterized by a nonconserved order parameter ( the activity density ) which is coupled to a conserved field @xcite whose evolution is arrested in space - time regions devoid of activity .    in recent years , a number of studies have characterized the critical properties of conserved stochastic sandpiles ( css ) . as is usual in studies of critical phenomena ,",
    "theoretical discussions of scaling and universality are anchored in the analysis of a continuum field theory or of a langevin equation ( i.e. , a nonlinear stochastic partial differential equation ) that reproduces the phase diagram and captures the fundamental symmetries and conservation laws of the system . in the case of css ,",
    "these symmetries and conservation laws define the _ conserved directed percolation _ ( cdp ) universality class @xcite .",
    "extensive numerical studies of a langevin equation corresponding to cdp are described in @xcite .",
    "the critical exponent values reported in @xcite are in good agreement with simulations of conserved lattice gas models @xcite , which exhibit the same symmetries and conservation laws as css .",
    "there is now strong evidence that the css belongs to the cdp universality class @xcite , although the existence of this class has been questioned by basu _",
    "_ @xcite . according to these authors",
    ", the css belongs to the usual directed percolation ( dp ) class ; further studies are required to verify this assertion .",
    "most studies of css characterize the critical region using the order parameter ( the activity density @xmath6 , i.e. , the fraction of active sites ) @xcite . in this work we study the diffusion particles in a two - dimensional css to characterize the phase transition through the diffusion constant @xmath7 , defined via the mean - square particle displacement .",
    "dhar and pradhan suggested @xmath7 and the order parameter would be proportional in abelian sandpiles @xcite .",
    "an earlier study by some of the present authors verified that @xmath7 scales in the same manner as the activity density in the stationary regime in one - dimensional stochastic sandpiles @xcite .",
    "dimensionality appears to play a nontrivial role in defining the universality of css @xcite , in particular , different relations between css and dp , and between css and an elastic interface model , in one and two dimensions .",
    "thus it is of interest to verify the relation between @xmath7 and @xmath6 in the two - dimensional case as well .",
    "in addition , we study ( for the first time , to our knowledge ) , the static activity correlation function and the particle mobility in the css .    the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we define the models . in sec .",
    "3 we report simulation results for the diffusion constant and the order parameter , and perform scaling analyses to extract estimates for the critical exponents .",

    "4 with a summary of our results .",
    "we study modified conserved stochastic sandpiles , related to manna s model @xcite , called the _ restricted - height sandpile _ in the standard version studied in @xcite .",
    "in addition we study the effect of a weak force or  drive \" @xmath8 directed along one of the lattice directions to determine the particle mobility .",
    "the model is defined on square lattice of @xmath9 sites , with periodic boundaries ; the configuration is specified by the number of particles , @xmath10 0 , 1 , or 2 , at each site @xmath11 .",
    "sites with @xmath12 are _ active _ , while those with @xmath13 , are said to be _",
    "inactive_. no site may harbor more than two particles .",
    "the temporal evolution consists of a series of _ toppling _ events , in which two particles are transferred from an active site to one or more of its first neighbors @xmath14 $ ] with equal probabilities .",
    "the target sites for the two particles are chosen independently .",
    "if a particle attempts to jump to a site already bearing two particles , it returns to the toppling site .",
    "the evolution follows a continuous - time markovian dynamics in which each active site has a transition rate of unity to topple . at each step of the evolution ,",
    "one of the current @xmath15 active sites is chosen at random to topple ; the time increment associated each step is @xmath16 . in this way , each active site waits , on average , one time unit before toppling .    in conserved sandpiles , the particle density , @xmath17 , serves as a temperature - like control parameter @xcite .",
    "below the critical value , @xmath18 , the system eventually reaches an absorbing configuration ( @xmath19 ) . for @xmath20 , by contrast , the activity continues indefinitely ( @xmath21 ) , in the infinite - size limit .",
    "the order parameter associated with the phase transition is the activity density , given by the fraction of active sites , @xmath22 .",
    "although activity _ must _ continue indefinitely if @xmath23 , remarkably , @xmath18 is in fact well below unity . for the model studied here ,",
    "the best estimate for the critical density is @xmath24 , as shown below .",
    "in this section we discuss our results , first for the usual restricted - height sandpile , and then for the model under a weak drive . in both cases , we study system sizes @xmath25 @xmath26 to @xmath27 .",
    "random numbers are generated using the gnu scientific library for c++ @xcite .",
    "initial configurations are generated by inserting @xmath28 particles randomly on a square lattice of @xmath9 sites , subject to the restriction @xmath29 .",
    "we performed three sets of studies : two in the immediate vicinity of critical point @xmath18 , and a third in the supercritical region .",
    "initially , we determine the value of @xmath18 using the moment ratio @xmath30 in quasistationary ( qs ) simulations @xcite .",
    "this method samples the qs probability distribution , i.e. , the probability distribution at long times , conditioned on survival ; for details on the method see @xcite .",
    "the number of realizations used to obtain @xmath31 varies from @xmath32 ( smallest size ) to @xmath33 ( largest size ) . since the particle density can only be varied in steps of @xmath34 , estimates for properties at intermediate values of @xmath35 are obtained via interpolation .",
    "figure  [ fig : m ] shows @xmath36 in the immediate vicinity of @xmath18 for @xmath37 - @xmath27 .",
    "the critical point @xmath18 is characterized by a finite limiting value , @xmath38 @xcite , so that @xmath35 values for which @xmath31 appears to grow or decrease without limit ( corresponding to the sub- and supercritical regimes , respectively ) , can be excluded as being off - critical . on the basis of these data , we estimate @xmath24 .",
    "moment ratio m versus system size for particle densities in the immediate vicinity of @xmath18 . ]",
    "next we turn to an analysis of the diffusion coefficient @xmath7 , defined via the usual relation :    @xmath39 ^ 2 + [ \\delta y]^2 \\right > = 4 d\\,t \\label{meansquare}\\ ] ]    for each particle @xmath40 , let @xmath41 and @xmath42 represent its displacement since time zero in the @xmath43 and @xmath44 directions , respectively , due to toppling events .",

    "( [ meansquare ] ) denote an average over particles and over independent realizations of the process .",
    "note that @xmath7 as defined above is , in general , a function of time , though we expect it to attain a stationary value at long times .",
    "since the displacements of a given particle at successive toppling events are independent , we expect the msd to grow linearly with the number of topplings .",
    "although not all displacement attempts are successful ( the height restriction causes some to be rejected ) , in the stationary regime the fraction of successful attempts @xmath48 is time - independent , as is the density @xmath6 of active sites .",
    "( by @xmath49 we mean the number of particles that change their position during the interval @xmath50 $ ] divided by twice the number of toppling events during this interval . ) thus the msd should grow linearly with _ time _ in the stationary regime , as is verified here and in the one - dimensional case @xcite . by the same reasoning ,",
    "if @xmath48 and/or @xmath6 vary with time , we should expect deviations from the linear relation @xmath51 ^ 2 + [ \\delta y]^2 \\rangle \\propto t$ ] .    for @xmath35 near @xmath18 ,",
    "the initial activity density generated by random particle insertion is much larger than the stationary activity density .",
    "this is easily seen by noting that , during the insertion process , setting the rate of particle insertion _ attempts _ at one particle per site and per unit time , @xmath52 the fractions @xmath53 of sites bearing exactly @xmath54 particles satisfy the equations  .",
    "when the particle density has attained its desired value @xmath35 , @xmath55 :    @xmath56    since the lattice is empty at time zero we have , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .",

    "( thus the stopping time @xmath61 is related to @xmath35 via a transcendental equation . ) for particle density @xmath62 , this yields an initial activity density of @xmath63 , much larger than the stationary activity density , which in fact tends to zero as @xmath64 at @xmath65 .",
    "thus we should expect the activity density @xmath66 to decrease initially .",
    "in fact , we can divide the sandpile evolution into four regimes , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : msd_rho ] ( a ) : ( 1 ) an initial transient ; ( 2 ) the subdiffusive regime , in which the msd grows more slowly than linearly while @xmath6 decays as a power law ; ( 3 ) a regime of anomalous growth in the activity @xmath66 ; ( 4 ) the stationary regime .",
