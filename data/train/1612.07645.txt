    "flapping flight , the only form of powered aerial locomotion in nature , involves unsteady aerodynamic phenomena that remain to be fully understood , especially at small scales and low reynolds numbers .",
    "such understanding would be of great benefit in the development of flapping - wing micro air vehicles ( fwmavs ) ; the performance of the current designs @xcite remains far inferior compared to the extreme manoeuvrability , agility and flight efficiency of their biological counterparts @xcite .    despite an intense research in the fluid dynamics modelling techniques over the past decades , reliable and accurate models applicable to an arbitrary flapping wing are missing .",
    "simpler , quasi - steady models , e.g. @xcite , can successfully predict the general trends of the sub - flap forces , provided that their force coefficients are based on empirical data .",
    "some studies capture the geometry of a deformable flapping wing during flapping , which is used as input for numerical fluid dynamics simulations @xcite .",
    "while these models do provide some insight into the flow details , in most cases they still can not predict the aerodynamic forces to a sufficient level of accuracy , as comparison to force - balance measurements reveals @xcite .",
    "a proper numerical treatment requires coupling of models of fluid dynamics with structural dynamics of the wing in order to capture the wing deformations under the load of aerodynamic forces @xcite .",
    "such models require a high computational effort while a further challenge can be an accurate identification of the structural parameters of the true wing .",
    "thus , so far , reliable flow field data has been obtained by experimental techniques .    in biological fliers ,",
    "the flow visualisation can be carried out either with tethered animals , or in - flight @xcite .",
    "tethering @xcite typically allows for higher quality flow visualisation results , as the relative position and orientation of the animal and the measurement region can be precisely adjusted , resulting into a higher resolution data @xcite .",
    "however , tethering usually also leads to unnatural wing movements so such measurements may not be representative of free flight .",
    "therefore , there would be a strong preference to perform flow visualisation under free flight conditions .",
    "free flight measurements were conducted in a flight arena with hovering hummingbirds @xcite and in a wind tunnel ( to represent the forward flight condition ) with bumblebees @xcite , bats @xcite , moths @xcite or hummingbirds @xcite . here , the challenge is to make the animal fly at the desired position with respect to the measurement region .",
    "this typically requires intensive training and food sources , such as nectar feeders , are used to attract the animal .",
    "nevertheless a successful measurement always requires some degree of luck due to the unpredictable behaviour of the animal . to increase the likeliness of a useful measurement",
    ", researchers typically opt for a larger measurement region , which has a trade off of lower resolution and thus less flow details captured by the measurements @xcite .",
    "free flight experiments with flapping - wing robots would be attractive for multiple reasons .",
    "apart from being able to quantify the effect of inherent body oscillations ( present only in free - flight ) on the air flow , flapping - wing robots can be programmed , meaning that the air flow could be investigated also during ( controlled and reproducible ) manoeuvres .",
    "moreover , it would be possible to investigate the effect of small parameter changes , such as wing span , wing aspect ratio , etc . in a structured manner .",
    "however , until now , flow visualisation experiments with robotic flappers were conducted in a tethered condition , because precise position control necessary for successful flow measurements posed considerable challenges .",
    "most of the studies used purposely built experimental flapping devices with model wings @xcite , while only a few works studied flight - capable fwmavs in a tethered configuration @xcite .    to make the free flight flow visualisation feasible , the fwmav needs to fly with high position accuracy .",
    "for the forward flight condition , autonomous precision wind tunnel flight has already been achieved with quadrotors @xcite and fixed wings @xcite , but fwmavs are much more challenging to control , because of more complex dynamics and stricter weight and size restrictions on on - board computers and sensors .",
    "our previous effort achieved the first successful autonomous wind - tunnel flight of a fwmav @xcite , but further improvements were still necessary to achieve the position and flight state stability necessary to perform such in - flight flow visualisation experiments .        in this work , we present a methodology with which we have performed the first flow visualisation of a freely flying fwmav ( figure [ fig : setup_photo]a ) .",
    "a main component of the methodology is a novel fwmav specific controller , which controls the mav position in the wind tunnel , with high accuracy , through feedback from an on - board inertial measurement unit ( imu ) and an external motion tracking system . in this first free - flight flow visualisation effort ,",
    "a time resolved stereographic particle image velocimetry ( piv ) method was used to measure the wake behind the fwmav , similar to our previous experiments with a tethered configuration @xcite .",
    "thanks to the achieved control accuracy and repeatability , future analysis of flow at different locations and with different piv methods is now possible .",
    "in addition to the challenging free - flight piv measurements , reference experiments were carried out under similar flight conditions , but with the same fwmav tethered in a fixed position in the wind tunnel ( figure [ fig : setup_photo]b ) .",
    "the purpose of these latter tests was to provide a comparison and assessment of the in - flight measurements , as our past study revealed differences between in - flight force estimates and clamped force balance measurements @xcite .",
    "these differences , observed mainly in the direction of the stroke plane , were partly attributed to the dynamic oscillations that are present in the free flight but are restricted in the clamped measurement .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : the experimental setup , the control algorithms and the piv processing techniques are presented in section [ sec : methods ] .",
    "section [ sec : results ] reports on the results of precision position control of the fwmav as well as on the flow visualisation results .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclusions ] provides conclusions and discusses potential future tests and improvements .",
    "the experiments were carried out with the delfly ii mav ( further called simply the delfly ) , a well - studied flapping - wing platform developed at tu delft @xcite .",
    "the delfly , displayed in figure [ fig : delfly ] ( a ) , is a biplane design with flexible wings ( 280 mm wing span ) arranged in a cross configuration , moving in opposite sense while flapping .",
    "once per wing beat cycle , the wings _ clap _ together as they meet and _ peel _ apart again , see figure [ fig : delfly ] ( b ) .",
    "this _ clap - and - peel _ mechanism has a positive effect on the overall thrust production and efficiency @xcite . due to its conventional tail with horizontal and vertical tail surfaces ,",
    "the delfly is inherently stable and its two control surfaces , the rudder and the elevator , are only used for steering .",
    "the delfly has a large flight envelope , which ranges from near hover flight ( @xmath0  0 m / s , vertical body orientation ) , to fast forward flight ( @xmath0  7 m / s , nearly horizontal body orientation ) . for faster speeds ,",
    "the centre of gravity needs to be shifted forward for inherent stability @xcite .    for the experiments described here ,",
    "the delfly was equipped with a lisa / s autopilot board @xcite , which includes a 6 dof mems inertial measurement unit ( imu ) for on - board attitude estimation ( invensense mpu 6000 ) and a 72 mhz arm cpu capable of running paparazzi open source autopilot system @xcite .",
    "the autopilot board was attached to the fuselage with a soft foam mount in order to isolate the high frequency vibration .",
    "further components include an mi-3a speed controller ( flashed with bl heli firmware ) driving the main brush - less motor ( customised design with 28 turns per winding @xcite ) , two super micro linear servo actuators for the tail control surfaces , a deltang rx31 receiver for the radio link and an esp8266 esp-09 wifi module for the datalink between the autopilot and the ground station .",
    "the system was powered by a 180 mah single cell lipo battery ( hyperion g3 lg325 - 0180 - 1s ) .",
    "the overall mass of around 23 grams allowed for flight endurance between 2 to 6 minutes , depending on the flight speed .    .",
    "a high speed mesa - piv double - pulse laser illuminated the measurement plane located about 150 mm downstream of the fwmav tail .",
    "its beam was expanded to form a @xmath0 2 mm wide laser sheet .",
    "prior to the measurements , the room was filled with water - glycol based fog of droplets in order to achieve homogenous seeding of the flow .",
    "illustration by sarah gluschitz ( cc by - nd 4.0 ) . ]",
    "the experiments were conducted in the open jet facility wind tunnel at tu delft , see figure [ fig : experimental_setup ] .",
    "this return - type , low speed wind tunnel has a large open test section with a cross - section of 2.8  m @xmath1 2.8  m , providing enough space for the proposed free flight experiments . during the tests ,",
    "the wind tunnel was operated at speeds ranging from 0.8  m / s to 2.4  m / s .",
    "the wind tunnel room was equipped with an optitrack motion tracking system ( naturalpoint , inc . ) consisting of 12 optitrack flex 13 motion tracking cameras ( resolution 1280  px @xmath1 1024  px , 120  fps ) .",
    "the system was primarily used for tracking the test aircraft position and heading , but provided also the positions and orientations of the measurement plane and the high speed cameras of the piv system . for reliable tracking ,",
    "the delfly mav was equipped with four active ir led markers placed on its body according to figure [ fig : delfly ] ( a ) .",
    "reflective markers were used on the remaining objects ( calibration plate , piv cameras ) .    the flow visualisation technique chosen for the experiments presented here",
    "is that of time - resolved stereoscopic particle image velocimetry ( piv ) .",
    "the piv system consists of a high speed laser and two high speed cameras which acquired images ( 1024 px @xmath1 1024 px ) at a rate of 5 khz . based on our prior experience in similar experiments with a clamped fwmav @xcite ,",
    "we have opted for performing measurements in the wake behind the delfly in order to avoid problems associated with laser reflections on the shiny surfaces of the wing and that of the wings blocking the camera view .",
    "the measurement plane was set normal to the free flow , behind the delfly tail and an advective approach ( `` taylor s hypothesis '' ) was applied to reconstruct an estimate of the three dimensional wake configuration .",
    "a similar approach has been used in a variety of animal studies @xcite .",
    "the delfly was controlled by the on - board autopilot , which was steering it towards a desired position set - point based on feedback from the external motion tracking system .",
    "an operator was monitoring on - line the position errors and triggered the measurement at a convenient moment .",
    "he would also repeat the measurement in case the errors were too large .",
    "additional ir leds , fixed with respect to the ground and detected by the tracking system , were turned on together with the trigger signal to the piv system , which served as a time stamp for time synchronisation of the tracking and piv data sets .",
    "the simultaneous application of the free - flight fwmav control and the piv measurements required to ensure that the optical motion tracking operation was not adversely affected by the laser light and the seeding fog introduced for the piv experiments .      to ensure successful piv measurements a high precision position control needs to be achieved , so that the wake of the delfly stays within the measurement region . at the same time , because we are interested in free steady flight , the thrust and power should not vary ( dramatically ) during the measurement .",
    "these are two opposing requirements : the wind tunnel will always have some remaining turbulence that the controller should respond to , but if tuned too aggressively , the power will vary significantly and the controller may even respond to the inherent flapping induced body rocking .",
    "the size of the piv measurement region ( 170  mm @xmath1 170  mm ) was chosen to be slightly larger than the half span of the delfly ( 140 mm ) so that the wake of the right half wings could be captured ( a symmetry of left and right half wings was assumed ) .",
    "because the dominant flow structures are observed behind the wing tips , we have estimated that a successful measurement can be carried out if the root mean square ( @xmath2 ) position error remains below 25  mm in all directions for a time course of 2 seconds ( a single piv measurement takes approximately 1 second ) . in order to meet these requirements , we designed a novel fwmav - specific control scheme .",
    "the tests presented here cover the flight speeds between 0.8  m / s and 2.4  m / s , which corresponds to body pitch angles between approximately 70@xmath3 and 30@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the large range of body pitch throughout the flight envelope affects the way the delfly is controlled : in near hover flight ( body almost vertical ) a change of flapping frequency will affect mostly the climbing / descending while elevator deflection @xmath4 will have a dominant effect on the body pitch and subsequently the forward speed . in fast forward flight ( body nearly horizontal )",
    "the control is inverted : flapping frequency change has a dominant effect on forward speed while pitching the body through elevator deflections affects mainly climbing / descending .",
    "a rudder deflection @xmath5 will initially cause a banked turn , but will result in a pure heading change once the rudder returns back to its neutral position .",
    "this is due to a positive dihedral angle of the mav providing inherent stability around the roll axis .",
    "such behaviour can be observed over the whole flight envelope , but the rudder effectiveness will vary with airspeed .",
    "thus , control of fwmav is extremely challenging as it needs to consider all these effects .",
    "a general block diagram of the designed control system is in figure [ fig : control_overview ] .",
    "the wind tunnel generates uniform airflow with a constant speed .",
    "the delfly flies relative to the moving air and is controlled by an on - board autopilot , which steers the vehicle based on feedback from the on - board imu ( used for attitude estimation ) and from an external motion tracking system that provides position and heading information ( with respect to ground ) .",
    "the tracking system data , captured at 120 hz , is transmitted via lan network to the ground control station and sent further , with a rate of 30 hz , to the autopilot using a wireless wifi data - link .",
    "the same link is also used for telemetry that can be viewed on - line on the ground station .",
    "the body position @xmath6 is expressed in the ground fixed system aligned with the wind tunnel : the @xmath7-axis points opposite the wind velocity vector , @xmath8 points down and @xmath9 completes the right - handed cartesian system , see fig .",
    "[ fig : axis_system ] .",
    "the body - fixed coordinate system is defined by the body s main axes : the @xmath10-axis points along the fuselage towards the nose , the @xmath11-axis points opposite to the direction of the vertical stabiliser , and the @xmath12-axis points starboard .",
    "its origin is placed at the centre of gravity . because the external motion tracking system measures the position of the geometrical centre of the four led markers , we used that value as an approximation of the centre of mass position .",
    "the body attitude @xmath13 is described by roll @xmath14 , pitch @xmath15 and yaw @xmath16 angles , which define the rotation around the @xmath10 , @xmath12 and @xmath11 axes , respectively .     and",
    "body - fixed @xmath17 , are introduced to define the body position in the wind - tunnel and the body attitude angles , respectively .",
    "consistent with the aerospace convention , the z axis is pointing downwards . panel ( a ) displays the side view with the longitudinal system parameters , assuming steady flight against the free stream @xmath18 .",
    "panel ( b ) shows the top view with the lateral system parameters . due to no roll control authority ,",
    "displacement in the @xmath9 direction is achieved through heading @xmath16 . ]",
    "the aircraft velocity @xmath19 is ( in steady - state ) pointing opposite to the wind velocity vector @xmath20 , that is we have @xmath21 and there is no motion relative to ground ( @xmath22 , see the longitudinal system in figure  [ fig : axis_system ] a ) ) .",
    "height @xmath23 is used as a measure of vertical position . the lift force @xmath24 and thrust force @xmath25",
    "are oriented normal and parallel to the wind velocity @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "they act at the centre of gravity and , in steady state , compensate the weight @xmath26 and drag force @xmath27 .",
    "figure  [ fig : axis_system ] b ) shows the lateral system for the case of non - zero heading @xmath16 . in such case",
    "the aircraft will move relative to ground with a non - zero velocity @xmath28 .      in the wind - tunnel experiment ,",
    "the desired flight path is simply a ( ground- ) fixed way - point .",
    "since the flight dynamics of the delfly are still being investigated and the linearised models identified so far are only valid at a single operating condition @xcite , no reliable model that would cover the whole flight envelope was available .",
    "thus , we employed a traditional aerospace control approach with control loops in a cascade arrangement , as implemented in the open - source paparazzi uav system @xcite .",
    "however , an additional speed - thrust control block was added in between the standard guidance and attitude control blocks to take care of varying thrust and lift produced at different body speeds ( and body attitudes ) , see figure [ fig : control_approach ] .",
    "thus , the guidance control determines the desired body accelerations and heading based on the position error from the set - point .",
    "the commanded accelerations are transformed into the desired thrust and pitch by the speed - thrust control block . while novel to fwmavs , a similar solution was used in the transitioning phase of hybrid uavs @xcite .",
    "finally , the attitude control loop determines the rudder and elevator deflections necessary to achieve the desired body pitch and heading .     and accelerations @xmath29 based on the current position error .",
    "the speed - thrust block determines the combination of pitch @xmath30 and thrust @xmath31 commands that leads , at the wind tunnel speed @xmath18 , to the desired accelerations .",
    "the attitude block controls the attitude through the rudder and elevator commands , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively . ]",
    "the guidance control is decentralised , i.e. we control the forward position @xmath7 , height @xmath23 and lateral position @xmath9 in separate loops . in the longitudinal loops ( forward + vertical ) we assume the delfly",
    "is always aligned with the wind tunnel axis , i.e. it is flying opposite to the wind direction @xmath20 .",
    "ordinary pd controllers are used in the longitudinal and vertical loops to determine the desired accelerations @xmath34 and @xmath35 , which are commanded to the inner loops . since the delfly has no roll control authority , the lateral position @xmath9 is controlled through heading @xmath36 . to compensate for steady state errors ,",
    "an integral gain was introduced to the lateral loop . the accelerations and heading commanded to the inner loops are thus determined as @xmath37 where",
    "@xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 denotes the p , d and i gains , respectively , and @xmath41 stands for the position error from the set - point .",
    "the p and d gains of the longitudinal and vertical loops were selected based on the desired closed loop behaviour ( assuming the plant to be a second order system with no inherent damping ) .",
    "the gains of the lateral loop were tuned during the flight tests .",
    "all the gain values , as used for the experiments in section [ sec : results_position ] , are summarised in table [ tab : gain_values ] .",
    "since the generation of lift and thrust is highly coupled , a suitable combination of pitch angle @xmath15 and throttle command @xmath42 ( controlling the flapping frequency @xmath17 ) that will result in the desired accelerations in the longitudinal and vertical directions needs to be found .",
    "this is the role of the speed - thrust control ( figure [ fig : semiadaptive ] ) , which consists of a feedforward and feed - back part .",
    "the feedforward control selects the necessary combination of @xmath15 and @xmath42 based on a linear model constructed from wind tunnel force measurements data .",
    "the feedback part improves the performance by correcting for model uncertainties , change of performance over time as well as external disturbances .",
    "is used to adapt the assumed equilibrium conditions @xmath43 and @xmath44 , until any potential position drift caused by model uncertainties of the feedforward control is removed . at time",
    "@xmath45 , when the equilibrium is approached , the operator switches to the correction phase and the adapted equilibrium conditions @xmath46 and @xmath47 are kept . in this phase the acceleration set - points from the outer guidance loop are tracked and an additional feedback loop is employed to compensate for disturbances , model uncertainties and performance changes due to decreasing battery voltage . ]",

    "@xmath52 is the matrix of force derivatives ( evaluated at the equilibrium @xmath49 ) @xmath53    by inverting equation  ( [ eq : speedthrust - liftanddrag ] ) we get @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the differences of thrust and lift from the equilibrium values @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively . assuming the horizontal and vertical systems are decoupled and neglecting any inherent damping , the body acceleration is a result of only the forces applied , @xmath57 .",
    "thus , the desired pitch angle and thrust can be found from the acceleration set - points as @xmath58    the matrix of aerodynamic force derivatives has been derived for different wind speeds , see table [ tab : aero_derivatives ] ; switching between the different values is done manually based on the wind tunnel set - point , which remains constant throughout the tests .",
    ".equilibrium conditions and aerodynamic force derivatives for various wind speeds , based on wind tunnel measurements described in @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     it can be immediately noted that the performance at low speeds is much better than at high speeds .",
    "originally , prior to the piv test session , we tuned the controller for speeds ranging from 0.8 m / s to 1.2 m / s , where the inherent stability of the delfly is the most pronounced .",
    "however , during the piv session we observed that the quality of captured data was worse than expected .",
    "the direction of the wake structures was dominated by the flapping - induced flow ( aligned with the body fuselage that is pitched by 50.5@xmath3 to 68.6@xmath3 at slow speeds ) and this resulted into a considerable angle between the measurement plane normal and the wake axis .",
    "therefore , within the time constraints of the wind tunnel slot available for the piv tests , we quickly tuned the controller also for high speeds ( 2.0 m / s and 2.4 m / s shown here ) , where the body pitch is much lower ( 33.8@xmath3 to 28.7@xmath3 ) .",
    "this was much more challenging , because the delfly ( in the configuration used for the tests ) is already very hard to fly at these speeds without any stability augmentation .    at low speeds ( 0.8 m / s and 1.2 m / s ) ,",
    "the position fix was very good .",
    "the best results were achieved in the vertical @xmath8 direction , where the delfly stayed within @xmath59 25 mm most of the time and the corresponding @xmath2 error was around 10 mm . in the forward direction , an accuracy better than @xmath59 50 mm",
    "was achieved most of the time , with an @xmath2 error of below 20 mm .",
    "most oscillations were observed in the lateral direction , yet a large part of the time the aircraft was also within @xmath59 50 mm from the set - point , which can be seen from the rms values that remain below 30 mm . according to the estimated criteria ( @xmath2 below 25  mm for the next 2 seconds ) a successful piv measurement could be started 49% and 65% of the time for 0.8 m / s and 1.2 m / s , respectively , meaning the waiting time of the operator monitoring the mav position and triggering the piv measurement would be very short .    at high speeds ,",
    "the delfly control is much more challenging as explained earlier .",
    "the @xmath2 error values were about 45 mm in forward and lateral directions and around 70 mm for forward direction . despite a worse overall performance ( the rms values were computed over several minutes of flight ) , there were segments of several seconds ( highlighted parts ) when the platform was very close to the set - point for at least 2 seconds in all the axes ( 3% and 4.8% of the total time for 2.0  m / s and 2.4  m / s , respectively ) .",
    "this gave us enough opportunities to trigger and perform successful piv measurements also at lower body pitch angles , where the flow patterns of the wake move almost normally to the vertical measurement plane , yielding higher quality flow measurements .",
    "the mean attitude captured at different speeds ( table [ tab : steady_state ] ) reveals that the roll and yaw angles were not exactly zero .",
    "this is due to imperfections of the hand - built delfly , in particular a slight misalignment of the tail caused by a twist in the square carbon tube used as fuselage , but this has a negligible effect on the piv measurements since the misalignment is in the order of a few degrees .",
    "this section provides results for the first free - flight flow visualization of the wake of the delfly .",
    "the piv measurements were performed in a plane oriented perpendicular to the freestream direction , at a distance of approximately 150 mm downstream of the tail , similar to measurements performed with bats of comparable sizes @xcite .",
    "results are presented here for the flight condition of a freestream speed of 2.4 m / s , flapping frequency of 12.0 hz and body angle of 28.7@xmath3 .",
    "the corresponding reduced frequency , defined as @xmath60 ( where @xmath17 is the flapping frequency , @xmath61 = 80  mm the mean wing chord and @xmath18 the freestream velocity ) has a value of 1.25 .",
    "the reynolds number is 13,000 , based on freestream velocity and wing chord . for comparison ,",
    "the tests were also conducted in a tethered setting with the identical delfly , rigidly fixed according to figure [ fig : setup_photo ] , similar to our previous trials @xcite .",
    "the flight conditions were comparable to the free - flight tests ( freestream speed of 2.0 m / s , flapping frequency of 12.1 hz , body angle of 33.8@xmath3 and reynolds number around 11,000 ) .",
    "piv images were recorded for a duration of approximately one second , at an acquisition frequency of 5 khz . given the flapping frequency of 12 hz , this implies that 12 cycles are captured , with approximately 400 images per cycle , indicating a well - resolved characterisation of the flapping cycle .",
    "the results presented in the following are the direct outcome of the measurements , i.e. , no additional averaging , smoothing or other form of filtering has been applied that could potentially further improve the quality of the visualisation .",
    "the relative position and orientation of the fwmav with respect to the centre of the measurement region , averaged over the duration of the piv recording , is displayed in figure [ fig : piv_position ] . while various position set - points were tested during the trials , this relative position allowed to capture the most prominent vortex structures in the wake , originating from the right halve of the wings .",
    "the good position stability over the duration of the piv measurement can be documented by the values of standard deviation from the mean position , which show that apart from a slight drift in the y direction ( @xmath62 mm ) a very good fix was achieved both in the forward ( @xmath63 mm ) and the vertical ( @xmath64 mm ) axes .     and [ fig : piv_helicity ] . ]    figure [ fig : piv_vorticityplanes ] displays a sample time series of four images separated by 0.065 seconds , with the vectors indicating the in - plane velocity components and the colour contours the out - of - plane vorticity .",
    "the most prominent feature observed in the visualisations can be associated to the tip vortex of the upper wing in the instroke phase ( red , corresponding to counter - clockwise vorticity ) .        ;",
    "blue : -0.6 m / s@xmath65 ) . ]    a three - dimensional representation of the wake vortex structure is obtained with the convection model , as described in section [ sec : methods_piv ] , which transforms the temporal information contained in the high - speed velocity field acquisition into a spatial representation by translating the flow field of subsequent images downstream with the freestream velocity .",
    "the result , displaying two flapping cycles , is shown in figure [ fig : piv_helicity ] . figure [ fig : piv_helicity]a applies to the free - flight condition and figure [ fig : piv_helicity]b to the tethered delfly .",
    "the visualisations provide a colour - coding of the helicity ( density ) , which is defined as the scalar product of the velocity and vorticity vectors .",
    "helicity can be used for the detection of vortex cores @xcite and non - zero helicity indicates a helical vortex structure with an axial flow .",
    "the sign of the helicity allows to distinguish vortex structures with different sense of swirl .",
    "the very prominent upper red structure ( positive helicity ) is the tip vortex formed by the upper wing during the instroke .",
    "the less distinct blue structure ( negative helicity ) is the tip vortex of the bottom wing generated during instroke as well .",
    "structures of the outstroke appear not to be very well captured in this representation , however .    notwithstanding",
    "the suboptimal quality of these preliminary results , an important observation is the good qualitative agreement between the free - flight and tethered wake flow structures , and the good repeatability of the two cycles for each case .",
    "this supports the conclusion that reliable and meaningful piv measurement results have been obtained also in the free - flight case .",
    "further processing of the data may allow for a more quantitative and detailed comparison between the free flight and tethered condition and potentially reveal if there are effects of the tethering to be detected .",
    "we presented a methodology , which combined a fwmav specific control approach for autonomous flight in a wind tunnel with a time - resolved stereoscopic piv and allowed the first flow visualisation experiments to be carried out with a freely flying flapping - wing robot .",
    "the novel fwmav specific control approach relied on feedback from an on - board imu and an external motion tracking system .",
    "applied to the 23 g delfly fwmav , an autonomous flight with high accuracy at low speeds ( 0.8 - 1.2 m / s , maximal root - mean - square error of 28 mm over 1 - 2 minutes ) and good accuracy at high speeds ( 2 - 2.4 m / s , maximal root - mean - square error of 75 mm over 3 - 4 minutes ) was achieved . moreover , even higher precision was often achieved for time intervals of several seconds .",
    "thus , the piv measurements , lasting around one second , could be triggered when the delfly was at the ideal position , which permitted to use a smaller measurement region and resulted in high resolution flow data .",
    "the free - flight piv measurements were performed at high free stream speeds ( 2 to 2.4 m / s ) , where the fwmav is pitched by 33.8@xmath3 to 28.7@xmath3 and flaps at frequencies of 12.1 hz to 12.0 hz , which corresponds to reynolds numbers of 11,000 to 13,000 and reduced frequencies of 1.5 to 1.25 .",
    "the flow was captured in a planar measurement region oriented perpendicular to the free stream direction and located in the wake approximately 150 mm downstream of the tail . for the initial interpretation of the measurements ,",
    "the time - series piv data were transformed into a quasi - three - dimensional representation of the wake structure using a passive convection model .",
    "for reference , measurements were also performed with a tethered fwmav at comparable conditions .",
    "the first results , presented in the form of helicity isosurfaces , showed a good repeatability among flapping cycles and also qualitative agreement between the free - flight and the tethered cases , suggesting that the free - flight measurements were reliable and meaningful .",
    "while the obtained results hold promises for further processing as well as for future experiments with the current setup , the data quality could be further increased by certain improvements of the control approach as well as of the flow visualisation procedure itself .",
    "while our control approach was designed and tested primarily for low speeds ( 0.8 m / s to 1.2 m / s ) , the first tests revealed that the interpretation of data captured in a plane perpendicular to the free stream direction can be complicated , because the relatively strong induced flow of the flapping wings , aligned with the body that is pitched by @xmath66 to @xmath67 , hits the measurement plane at considerable angles .",
    "this phenomena will diminish with increasing speed , which allowed to perform meaningful measurements at speeds of 2 m / s to 2.4 m / s . for even better results",
    ", the control approach should be revised , as the dynamics of the delfly become much more challenging at these speeds . however , even with a further increased position accuracy , the stereoscopic piv method limits the measurements to be conducted in the wake only , as measurements closer to or even around the wings would have to deal with laser reflections on the wings .    to enable reliable measurements around the wings , but also meaningful measurements at lower speeds , we recommend using a true 3d visualisation method such as tomographic piv @xcite for future experiments .",
    "standard tomo - piv using conventional seeding is not feasible , however , for the measurement volume size and data acquisition rate required for the present experimental conditions .",
    "recent developments have explored the potential of achieving large - scale tomographic measurements by using small ( sub - millimetre ) neutrally - buoyant helium - filled soap bubbles as tracer particles @xcite .",
    "although several studies have indeed proven the feasibility of this approach , we decided not to employ this method for the first trials , because as a relatively new method it still has its own challenges , many of which are related to the soap bubbles used as seeding particles .",
    "they are being employed due to their high reflectivity , which is needed when the laser beam of finite power is expanded to illuminate larger volumes .",
    "however , the soap bubbles tend to stick to the fwmav wing foils , which negatively affects the wing operation over time . for this reason , the exposure of the wings to the particles needs to be as limited as possible , which needs a specific measurement strategy to be used that minimises this effect .",
    "the initial results presented here proved that the developed methodology provides a reliable and repeatable way of obtaining piv data in free flight and that the data quality is comparable to what is usually achieved in a ( traditional ) tethered setting .",
    "moreover , this new approach , employing flying robots instead of animals , enables to perform measurements not only in steady state , but also during arbitrary controlled and reproducible manoeuvres .",
    "it also allows for further systematic investigations of parameter changes such as wing span , aspect ratio , wing flexibility , etc .",
    ", something that was not possible before in free flight .",
    "we thank sarah gluschitz for making the nice sketch of the experimental setup ."
