    "systems possessing a continuous nonequilibrium phase transition from an active into an empty , absorbing state have been intensively studied in the past few years . despite the wide variety of processes that have been investigated , it has proved possible to classify the critical properties of these transitions into a small number of universality classes .",
    "although the well known case of directed percolation ( dp ) @xcite has turned out to be the most common universality class , many investigations have examined systems with quite different critical properties .",
    "for instance , the model of _ branching and annihilating random walks _ with an _ even _ number of offspring ( barw ) defines a separate universality class @xcite .",
    "this reaction  diffusion system consists of random walkers able to undergo the branching and annihilating reactions @xmath0 and @xmath1 , with @xmath2 even .",
    "other models in this class ( at least in @xmath7 ) include certain probabilistic cellular automata @xcite , monomer ",
    "dimer models @xcite , nonequilibrium kinetic ising models @xcite , and generalized dp with two absorbing states @xcite .",
    "these models escape from the dp universality class by possessing an extra conservation law or symmetry .",
    "the barw model respects an additional `` parity '' conservation of the total number of particles modulo @xmath10 . on the other hand , branching and annihilating random walks with an odd number of offspring possess no such `` parity '' conservation , and hence belong to the dp universality class@xcite . for the other models mentioned above @xcite",
    ", the dp class is escaped via an underlying symmetry between the absorbing states .",
    "both the dp and barw classes do , however , share one important feature : the dynamical processes involved are short  ranged .",
    "one would expect that the addition of long  ranged processes would significantly alter the properties of the active / absorbing transitions . recently",
    "this expectation was confirmed by investigations of lvy dp ( ldp ) .",
    "this modification , originally proposed by mollison @xcite in the context of epidemic spreading , is a generalization of dp where the distribution of spreading distances @xmath3 is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the spatial dimension of the system , and @xmath8 is a free parameter ( the lvy index ) that controls the characteristic shape of the distribution .",
    "this distribution is asymptotically ( as @xmath13 ) equal to a lvy distribution , and we will loosely refer to it as such . it was first suggested that the critical exponents describing the ldp transition should vary continuously with @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "this expectation was backed up by field theoretic renormalization group calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite , and confirmed numerically in refs .",
    "note that other numerical work  @xcite introduced an upper cut off for the flight distance @xmath3 .",
    "this resulted in effective _ short  range _ behavior , meaning that the ldp regime was not properly accessed .",
    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite also appear to be adversely affected by strong finite size effects .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to further investigate the impact of lvy flights in models with nonequilibrium phase transitions .",
    "we will analyze in detail a model of _ branching and annihilating lvy flights _ with an _ even _ number of offspring ( balf ) , a straightforward generalization of the barw model , where the random walkers are replaced by particles performing lvy flights .",
    "the balf model possesses an upper critical dimension @xmath14 which varies continuously with the lvy index @xmath8 . for @xmath15 ,",
    "the model contains two new universality classes resulting from the long  range nature of the lvy flights .",
    "the exponents in both of these classes also vary continuously with @xmath8 .",
    "we will investigate these new universality classes using field theoretic methods , some exact results for the pure annihilation model ( where the branching parameter is set equal to zero ) , and monte  carlo simulations in @xmath7 .",
    "a further attractive feature of the balf model is that it casts some additional light on the properties of the ordinary short  ranged barw model .",
    "we will see that changing the lvy index from @xmath16 to @xmath17 for the balf model in fixed dimension @xmath7 is in many ways similar to changing the physical dimension from @xmath18 to @xmath7 in the short  ranged barw model .",
    "although this correspondence is certainly not rigorous , we can nevertheless use simulations of the balf model in the physical dimension @xmath7 to better understand properties of the barw model which lie in the inaccessible dimensions between @xmath7 and @xmath18 .",
    "this will allow us to probe numerically some important features of the barw field theory developed by cardy and tuber in ref.@xcite .",
    "we now give a brief summary of the layout of the paper .",
    "in the next section we briefly review the relevant properties of the short  ranged barw model . in section",
    "iii we then introduce the balf model and present its mean field behavior .",
    "after these preliminaries we then present the field theoretic action for balf , which we analyze using diagrammatic and renormalization group methods . these results",
    "are then compared with monte ",
    "carlo simulations in section  iv . finally , our conclusions appear in section  v.",
    "the barw model is defined by the following reaction processes : @xmath19 where the identical particles @xmath20 otherwise perform simple random walks with diffusion constant @xmath21 . as",
    "the reaction rate parameters are varied , one finds a continuous phase transition from a region controlled by the pure annihilation process to an active region characterized by a nonzero particle density in the steady  state . the growth of barw clusters close to the critical point can be summarized by a set of independent exponents .",
    "a natural choice is to consider @xmath22 and @xmath23 , which describe the divergence of the correlation lengths in space , @xmath24 , and time , @xmath25 , close to criticality .",
    "here the parameter @xmath26 describes the deviation from the critical point at the active / absorbing transition .",
    "we also need the order parameter exponent @xmath27 , which can be defined in two _ a priori _ different ways : it is either governed by the probability that a cluster grown from a finite seed never dies , @xmath28 or by the coarse - grained density of active sites in the steady state , @xmath29 these exponents can be simply calculated in mean field theory , valid for @xmath30 .",
    "the appropriate mean field rate equation for the coarse  grained density @xmath31 is given by @xmath32 for @xmath33 no branching is present , and we are reduced to the well known annihilation reaction @xmath1 , which asymptotically exhibits a power law mean field density decay @xmath34 .",
    "however , for nonzero @xmath35 , we have the homogeneous steady  state solution @xmath36 .",
    "hence the critical value of @xmath35 clearly lies at zero , and we identify @xmath37 .",
    "the density thus behaves as @xmath38 , and we immediately see that @xmath39 . the alternative order parameter exponent @xmath40 can also be simply calculated : for @xmath30 , the survival probability ( [ p_bulk ] ) of a particle cluster will be finite for _ any _ value of the branching rate , implying that @xmath41 .",
    "this result follows from the non  recurrence of random walks in @xmath42 .",
    "the correlation length exponents can also be simply derived from eq .",
    "( [ mfeq ] ) , yielding @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "hence the dynamic exponent @xmath45 , defined by @xmath46 , is given by @xmath47 .",
    "below the upper critical dimension the above mean field analysis breaks down due to the presence of fluctuations .",
    "recently , methods have been developed to systematically include these fluctuation effects .",
    "firstly , the appropriate master equation , which provides a complete description of the microscopic dynamics of the system , is transformed into a second  quantized hamiltonian . this representation",
    "is then mapped onto a coarse  grained field theoretic action @xcite .",
    "from this point the standard tools of renormalized perturbation expansions can be employed , and the effects of fluctuations systematically computed . for the case of barw , this analysis was performed in ref .  @xcite . in the following",
    "we summarize the main results of that analysis .",
    "the field theoretic action for barw , written in terms of the response field @xmath48 and the `` density '' field @xmath49 , is given by @xcite @xmath50= \\int d^dx \\bigg [ \\int_0^{\\tau } dt \\big[\\hat\\psi({\\bf x},t)[\\partial_t- d{\\bf\\nabla}^2]\\psi({\\bf x},t ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\quad -\\lambda[1-\\hat\\psi({\\bf x},t)^2]\\psi({\\bf x},t)^2 \\label{baweaction } \\\\ & & \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\quad + \\mu_m[1-\\hat\\psi({\\bf x},t)^m]\\hat\\psi({\\bf x},t)\\psi({\\bf x},t)\\big ]   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\quad -\\psi({\\bf x},\\tau)-n_0\\hat\\psi({\\bf x},0)\\bigg ] \\nonumber .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the terms on the first line of ( [ baweaction ] ) represent diffusion of the particles ( with continuum diffusion constant @xmath21 ) .",
    "the second line describes the annihilation reaction ( with continuum rate @xmath51 ) , while the terms on the third line represent the branching process ( with continuum rate @xmath35 ) .",
    "the final two terms represent , respectively , a contribution due to the projection state ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and the initial condition ( an uncorrelated poisson distribution with mean @xmath52 ) . in the following",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the case of _ even _",
    "@xmath2 , since it is known that the odd @xmath2 case belongs to the dp universality class @xcite .",
    "the action given in ( [ baweaction ] ) is a _ bare _ action . in order to properly include fluctuation effects one must be careful to include processes generated by a combination of branching and annihilation . in other words in addition to the process @xmath53 , the reactions @xmath54 ,  , @xmath55 need to be included .",
    "these considerations lead to the full action @xmath56= \\int d^dx   \\bigg[\\int_0^{\\tau } dt \\big[\\hat\\psi({\\bf x},t ) [ \\partial_t- d{\\bf\\nabla}^2]\\psi({\\bf x},t ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad + \\sum_{l=1}^{m/2}\\mu_{2l}[1-\\hat\\psi({\\bf x},t)^{2l } ] \\hat\\psi({\\bf x},t)\\psi({\\bf x},t ) \\label{barwbulk } \\\\ & &   \\qquad\\quad -\\lambda[1-\\hat\\psi({\\bf x},t)^2]\\psi({\\bf x},t)^2\\big ] -\\psi({\\bf x},\\tau)-n_0\\hat\\psi({\\bf x},0)\\bigg ] \\nonumber .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] notice also that ( for _ even @xmath2 _ ) the action ( [ barwbulk ] ) is invariant under the `` parity '' transformation @xmath57 this symmetry corresponds physically to particle conservation modulo @xmath10 .",
    "the presence of this extra symmetry now takes the system away from the dp universality class , and into a new class : that of branching and annihilating random walks with an even number of offspring .    simple power counting on the action in eq .",
    "( [ barwbulk ] ) reveals that the upper critical dimension is @xmath58 .",
    "close to @xmath14 , the renormalization of the above action is quite straightforward ( here we again quote the results from ref .",
    "@xcite ) . at the annihilation fixed point",
    "the rg eigenvalue of the branching parameter can easily be computed . to one loop order",
    "one finds @xmath59 , where @xmath60 .",
    "hence we see that the _ lowest _ branching process is actually the most relevant .",
    "therefore , close to @xmath10 dimensions where the branching remains relevant , we expect to find an _ active _ state for all nonzero values of the branching ( in agreement with the mean field theory presented above ) .",
    "furthermore , in this regime , we can exploit the fact that the critical point , which remains at zero branching , is described by the pure annihilation theory . matching the exactly known density decay  @xcite and survival probability exponents in the annihilation theory with their counterparts in the critical barw theory yields the exact exponent relations @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 @xcite . to the best of our knowledge , the result for @xmath64 ,",
    "although simple to derive , has not previously been given in the literature .",
    "inspection of the one loop result for the most relevant rg eigenvalue @xmath65 shows that it eventually becomes negative .",
    "this occurs at a second critical dimension @xmath66 , where @xmath67 to one loop order .",
    "for @xmath68 we expect a major change in the behavior of the system , since the branching process will no longer be relevant at the annihilation fixed point . the critical transition point",
    "is then shifted with the active state only being present for values of the branching greater than some positive critical value . for branching parameter values smaller than this value",
    ", the branching will be asymptotically irrelevant .",
    "this region of parameter space will thus be controlled by the annihilation fixed point of the @xmath1 process , where the density decays away as a power law .",
    "hence this region of parameter space should be considered a critical inactive ( or absorbing ) phase .",
    "the presence of a second critical dimension @xmath69 immediately rules out any possibility of using perturbative @xmath70 expansions to access the non  trivial active / absorbing transition expected in the physical dimension @xmath7 . instead cruder techniques ( such as the loop expansion in fixed dimension )",
    "must be employed @xcite .",
    "we will not discuss this part of the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite in much detail .",
    "however we do wish to point out that the truncated loop expansion at one loop does predict a jump in the critical point at around @xmath69 , from zero branching to some finite value .",
    "we will have more to say about his observation in section  iv , after we have presented our analytical and numerical study of the balf model .",
    "it is also possible to analyze the barw model in @xmath7 using exact methods . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was demonstrated that , at the annihilation fixed point , the one loop rg eigenvalue @xmath65 is actually exact in @xmath7 .",
    "however , the reason for the cancellation of the contributions from higher loop orders in the field theory remains unclear .",
    "other work @xcite , using quantum spin hamiltonians , has indicated that the exponents @xmath71 and @xmath64 are exactly equal at the active / absorbing transition in @xmath7 . this conclusion is also supported by numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "we now turn to the main object of this paper : a systematic investigation of the balf model . to begin with , we consider the model at the mean field level . the appropriate mean field equation is given by @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the rates for normal and anomalous ( lvy ) diffusion , respectively .",
    "the anomalous diffusion operator @xmath75 describes moves over long distances and is defined by its action in momentum space @xmath76 where @xmath77 .",
    "the standard diffusion term @xmath78 takes into account the short  range component of the lvy distribution .",
    "a more detailed derivation and justification for the lvy term can be found in ref .",
    "the mean field exponents can now easily be extracted .",
    "the critical point remains at zero branching , and , for @xmath6 , we identify @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath44 , and @xmath81 .",
    "note that , for @xmath82 , these exponents cross over smoothly to the ordinary mean field barw exponents . even at the mean field level",
    ", we can see that the exponent @xmath83 varies continuously with the lvy index @xmath8",
    ".    the above mean field description will only be quantitatively valid above the upper critical dimension . for @xmath84",
    ", we must again take fluctuation effects into account .",
    "this can be done using the same methods as were used for the short  ranged barw model @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the inclusion of the long  ranged lvy processes does not introduce any particular difficulties for the field theory mapping ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for further details ) .",
    "specializing immediately to the case with @xmath85 , and defining @xmath86 , we find that the field theoretic action is given by @xmath87= \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\quad \\int d^dx \\bigg [ \\int_0^{\\tau } dt \\big[\\hat\\psi ( { \\bf x},t)[\\partial_t-   d_n{\\bf\\nabla}^2 -d_a{\\bf\\nabla}^{\\sigma}]\\psi({\\bf x},t ) \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\quad -\\lambda[1-\\hat\\psi({\\bf x},t)^2]\\psi({\\bf x},t)^2 \\label{balfeaction } \\\\ & & \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\quad + \\mu[1-\\hat\\psi({\\bf x},t)^2]\\hat\\psi({\\bf   x},t)\\psi({\\bf x},t)\\big ] \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\quad   -\\psi({\\bf x},\\tau)-n_0\\hat\\psi({\\bf x},0)\\bigg ] \\nonumber .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this action describes both normal and anomalous diffusion .",

    "we have calculated the renormalization group flow functions and eigenvalues , so as to determine the long distance and late time behavior of this field theory .",
    "the one loop contribution to the renormalized annihilation vertex is given by the diagram in fig .",
    "[ vertices]a . for the case where @xmath92 , the propagator is @xmath93 in @xmath94 space ( @xmath95 is the laplace transformed time variable ) , or @xmath96 in @xmath97 space .",
    "it turns out to be easiest to calculate an extended  time vertex function in @xmath98 space , and then determine the renormalized coupling in @xmath99 space by performing a laplace transform and evaluating at the normalization point @xmath100 .",
    "the first step is to drop the normal diffusion term , as it is less relevant for @xmath101 .",
    "the dimensionless renormalized annihilation coupling is defined by @xmath102 with @xmath103 , and @xmath104 the one loop renormalization factor @xmath105 is then @xmath106 hence the @xmath27 function is given by @xmath107 with fixed points at @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "the result ( [ betaell ] ) is actually exact to all orders in perturbation theory @xcite . for @xmath110 , the gaussian fixed point at @xmath108 is stable , while for @xmath111 , the non ",
    "trivial @xmath112 fixed point at @xmath113 is stable .    to investigate the relevance of the branching process",
    ", we now calculate the one loop rg eigenvalue for the branching process at the annihilation fixed point . defining the dimensionless renormalized branching rate as @xmath114 then , from the diagram in fig .",
    "[ vertices]b , we can compute the one loop renormalization factor @xmath115 hence the @xmath116 function is @xmath117 thus the one loop rg eigenvalue for the branching process at the annihilation fixed point is @xmath118 consequently , according to the one loop theory , the branching process is relevant at the annihilation fixed point for @xmath119 or , in @xmath7 , for @xmath120 . hence , as in the mean field case",
    ", we expect an active phase for all nonzero values of the branching rate @xmath121 , for sufficiently small @xmath8 ( see also the phase diagram in section iv ) . in this regime",
    ", we can again exploit the fact that criticality lies at zero branching , and hence that the critical behavior of the balf model coincides with that for the simple lvy annihilation model @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "for the lvy annihilation model , several exact results can be derived : the density decays as @xmath122 ( for @xmath123 ) @xcite ; the survival probability decays as @xmath124 ( also for @xmath123 ) ; and the dynamic exponent is just @xmath125 ( for @xmath6 ) .",
    "the second of these results follows in a simple way from the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , but is nevertheless , to the best of our knowledge , a new result . on the other hand in the balf model",
    "it is straightforward to show that , at criticality , the density should decay as @xmath126 , and the survival probability as @xmath127 , and where again we have @xmath125 at the lvy annihilation fixed point @xcite .",
    "matching these results to the lvy annihilation case , we have @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "hence , in the regime @xmath130 , there is just one independent exponent which must be calculated perturbatively . following a similar analysis to that in ref .",
    "@xcite , this exponent can be taken to be @xmath83 , which in terms of the rg eigenvalue for the branching is given by @xmath131 .",
    "ideally , at the annihilation fixed point in @xmath7 , one would like to be able to calculate the rg eigenvalue @xmath132 exactly , as was done in the short  ranged barw model @xcite .",
    "remarkably in that case it was found that the one loop result was exact .",
    "unfortunately , generalizing the methods of ref .",
    "@xcite to the lvy case does not seem to be straightforward .",
    "however there is some numerical evidence ( to be presented in the next section ) to suggest that the one loop result for @xmath132 in the lvy case is again exact .",
    "we also note that , in the above regime , if @xmath133 then , to one loop order , we expect a smooth crossover to the short  ranged barw model .",
    "hence , at least at the one loop level , the model in this regime is more straightforward than the ldp case , where there are additional complications ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for more details ) .",
    "we now discuss the case where , for @xmath134 , the branching becomes irrelevant at the lvy annihilation fixed point .",
    "for this regime to be present at all , then from eq .",
    "( [ sigmac ] ) , we require @xmath135 to one loop order . in this regime",
    "we expect the critical branching rate @xmath136 to become nonzero . for @xmath137",
    ", the branching will be asymptotically irrelevant , and this phase will again be governed by the exponents of the pure lvy annihilation universality class @xcite . at @xmath138",
    "we then expect a non  trivial transition to an active phase .",
    "as was the case for the short  ranged barw model we expect this transition to be inaccessible to controlled perturbative expansions , and in a different universality class to that discussed above .",
    "this follows from the fact that this transition only appears below a second critical dimension @xmath139 to one loop order .",
    "hence , as was the case for the short  ranged barw model , @xmath140 expansions down from the upper critical dimension @xmath5 will not be able to access this transition .",
    "we note that a `` precursor '' of the critical inactive phase present for @xmath141 is already evident in the @xmath130 regime . using the above analysis",
    "we see that @xmath142 for @xmath130 ( to one loop ) .",
    "hence , to this order , as @xmath143 from below , @xmath71 diverges .",
    "this implies that for a fixed small value of the branching , the active phase has a decreasing density as a function of @xmath8 , as @xmath8 is increased towards @xmath144 . finally at @xmath145 ( to one loop order ) an entire critical inactive phase opens up .",
    "we can now see the similarities between properties of the short  ranged barw model as dimension is lowered from @xmath18 to @xmath7 , and the balf model in @xmath7 , as the lvy index is raised from @xmath16 to @xmath17 .",
    "in particular , to one loop order , the region @xmath146 for the @xmath7 balf model contains the direct analog of the inaccessible universality class present in barw for @xmath147 .",
    "in order to further investigate the balf universality class , we have performed extensive numerical simulations of a lattice balf model in @xmath7 . at each time step ,",
    "a randomly chosen particle was allowed either to branch , with probability @xmath148 , or to move , via a long  range jump , with probability @xmath149 ; @xmath149 was the only parameter in the simulations .",
    "the number of particles at each lattice site was restricted to zero or one : thus , when a particle moved to an occupied site , both particles were annihilated . at each branching step ,",
    "a particle produced two offspring , which occupied the two sites to the immediate left or right of the original particle , with the side chosen randomly . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , this method of choosing occupied sites is necessary since if the newly occupied sites are chosen symmetrically about the original site , then the short  ranged barw model turns out to be in its inactive state for all @xmath150 .",
    "the distribution of hop lengths was chosen to follow eq .",
    "( [ levydef ] ) , for @xmath151 .",
    "this distribution is implemented by choosing a random number @xmath152 from a uniform distribution on the interval @xmath153 , and then calculating a new random variable @xmath154 .",

    "first , the quantities measured were also expected to behave as power laws on the ( critical ) inactive side of the transition .",
    "the difference between the equivalent exponents on the critical line and in the critical phase were sometimes small , particularly near @xmath174 , where the fixed point we investigated merges with the pure lvy annihilation fixed point .",
    "consequently measurements close to this point required the longest runs .",
    "also , corrections to scaling meant that the effective local exponents did , in fact , vary with @xmath158 .",
    "the impact of these corrections to scaling was sometimes difficult to interpret accurately .",
    "finally , the various exponents measured yielded slightly different estimates for @xmath175 , making it difficult to determine the critical point more accurately than done here",
    ". this may be due to the corrections to scaling being of different sizes for each of the exponents measured .",

    "this is in good agreement with the one loop result for @xmath132 in eq .",
    "( [ ymu ] ) , and provides some evidence that this one loop result may in fact be exact , as it was for the short  ranged lvy case .    @xmath177 the measured exponents changed by rather small amounts over the range of @xmath8 studied .",
    "as discussed in section  iii , the exponents at @xmath174 , @xmath179 , can be calculated for the pure lvy annihilation model , and , assuming @xmath180 , are given by @xmath181 , @xmath182 .",
    "if the exponents are to change monotonically as @xmath8 is varied , then they are trapped in a relatively small range of values between the barw and lvy annihilation exponents .",
    "@xmath177 the numerical evidence also strongly favors a smooth movement of the critical value @xmath175 away from unity as @xmath8 is increased above @xmath9 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ phase ] .",
    "this finding has consequences for the analogous short  ranged barw model . in that case",
    "the analog of the point at @xmath183 is the second critical dimension found at @xmath69 .",
    "the uncontrolled truncated loop expansion used to analyze this point in ref .",
    "@xcite predicted a discontinuous jump of the critical point as dimension @xmath12 is lowered through @xmath66 .",
    "the above numerical evidence argues against this scenario and would rather predict a smooth movement of the critical point .",
    "given the uncontrolled nature of the truncated loop expansion , any failure to accurately capture the behavior close to @xmath66 would not , perhaps , be very surprising .",
    "nevertheless , our results have , for the first time , provided numerical evidence for one of the main conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite , namely the presence of a second critical dimension @xmath66 .",
    "@xmath177 despite considerable effort , the data reported in table  [ exp_table ] are unfortunately not precise enough to answer the question : at what value of @xmath8 do the lvy results cross over to those of the short  ranged barw model ? regrettably , the situation from a theoretical perspective is no clearer , due to the absence of any controlled field theoretic methods in this regime .",
    "we now turn our attention to the second regime for @xmath7 balf , that for @xmath184 . in this case , it is not appropriate to perform simulations at criticality , since in that case we would only be measuring the exponents of the pure lvy annihilation model .",
    "hence we have performed off ",
    "critical simulations in an effort to measure @xmath71 as a function of @xmath8 . in this case",
    ", we used a second initial condition , a fully occupied lattice of size @xmath185 .",
    "we then allowed the number of particles to decay away until a steady  state was reached .",
    "the steady  state density depends on the deviation from the critical point , as described by eq .",
    "( [ n(delta ) ] ) , and thus @xmath71 may be directly measured .",

    "in this paper we have presented an analytic and numerical study of the balf model .",
    "using field theoretic techniques we have obtained a good analytic understanding of the model in the physical dimension @xmath7 for the regime @xmath8 less than about @xmath9 . for values of @xmath8 larger than this",
    ", we have had to rely solely on numerical simulations . in both regimes",
    "the critical exponents of the active / absorbing transition are found to vary continuously with the lvy index @xmath8 .",
    "numerically , we find that the transition between the two regimes in @xmath7 occurs at @xmath186 , in agreement with the one loop result from the field theory . unfortunately our numerics for the small @xmath8 regime were not good enough to confirm the accuracy of our @xmath70 expansion calculations .",
    "nevertheless this is the first time this universality class has been accessed , since its equivalent in the original barw model lies in the inaccessible dimensions @xmath187 .",
    "finally , we would like to emphasize that lvy flights are a powerful way of probing the higher dimensional behavior of nonequilibrium models while performing simulations only in @xmath7 .",
    "the disadvantage of this approach is that it necessitates the use of extremely large system sizes if finite size effects are to be avoided .",
    "however , we have shown that in large regions of parameter space these problems can be overcome , and reasonable estimates obtained for the exponents .",
