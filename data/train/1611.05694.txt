    "systems with long - range interactions may display a notable thermodynamic behavior that distinguish them from those where the interactions are short - ranged  @xcite .",
    "long - range interactions are those for which the range is comparable with the size of the system , regardless of how large the system is , as it occurs , for instance , in self - gravitating systems  @xcite , plasmas  @xcite , fluid dynamics  @xcite , and some spin systems  @xcite . because of these interactions , the system may remain trapped in nonequilibrium quasi - stationary states  @xcite whose lifetimes depend on the number of particles and diverge in the limit @xmath0 . for large but finite number of particles in a very long time limit",
    ", however , the system eventually evolves towards states of thermodynamic equilibrium  @xcite that can be described within the usual framework of ensemble theory . at equilibrium",
    ", such systems may present ensemble inequivalence  @xcite associated to anomalies in the concavity of the thermodynamic potentials  @xcite .",
    "in particular , a negative heat capacity in the microcanonical ensemble  @xcite is due to an anomaly in the concavity of the entropy as a function of the energy .",
    "in addition , systems with long - range interactions , in general , do not obey the usual gibbs - duhem equation  @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion regarding self - gravitating systems ) .",
    "this fact is deeply related with the nonadditive character that long - range interactions confer to these systems  @xcite . actually , nonadditivity is responsible for the remarkable behavior observed in long - range interacting systems  @xcite , as well as for the physics behind the subject we discuss in this paper : the appearance of a new equilibrium statistical ensemble in the thermodynamic limit .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the thermodynamics of long - range interacting systems under completely open conditions",
    ". a completely open system can exchange heat , work , and matter with its surroundings .",
    "that is , the energy , volume , and number of particles of the system fluctuate under completely open conditions .",
    "thus , the control parameters that specify the thermodynamic state of the system are temperature , pressure , and chemical potential .",
    "these control parameters are properties of a suitable reservoir that weakly interacts with the system , in the sense that , by means of some mechanism , it supplies heat , work , and matter to the system , but can be assumed not to be coupled by long - range interactions .",
    "it is worth mentioning that under these conditions the system is not enclosed by rigid walls . instead",
    ", the system could be confined by an external field exerting pressure on it ; e.g. , tidal forces produced by surrounding objects in self - gravitating systems or magnetic fields acting on plasmas  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the unconstrained ensemble is the statistical ensemble that describes a completely open system ( in the literature , this ensemble is also termed generalized  @xcite ) .",
    "it was introduced by guggenheim  @xcite , but it did not receive much attention due to its lack of application in standard macroscopic systems . if the interactions in the system are short - ranged , the free energy associated to this ensemble is vanishingly small when the number of particles is large  @xcite .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that temperature , pressure , and chemical potential can not be treated as independent variables because they are related by the gibbs - duhem equation .",
    "thus they are not , taken together , suitable control parameters for macroscopic systems with short - range interactions .    in case",
    "that the limit of large number of particles is not assumed , however , the situation changes , as pointed out by hill  @xcite .",
    "small systems may have an extra degree of freedom which permits that equilibrium configurations in completely open conditions can be realized  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , when the size of the system is increased , the usual behavior of macroscopic systems is obtained  @xcite , as long as the interactions remain short - ranged .",
    "our aim here is to show that equilibrium configurations with a large number of particles may be realized in the unconstrained ensemble if the interactions in the system are long - ranged .",
    "moreover , we argue that the replica energy  @xcite is the appropriate free energy defining such configurations in this ensemble . thus , in sec .",
    "[ unconstrained_ensemble ] , we will first describe this ensemble and make the appropriate connection with the thermodynamics . in sec .",
    "[ modified_thirring_model ] we introduce a solvable model , whose thermodynamics in the unconstrained ensemble is discussed in sec .",

    "in addition , some thermodynamic relations associated with the replica energy are analyzed in sec .",
    "[ thermodynamic_relations ] , and our conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "to make our point clear , it is worth to briefly review the thermostatistics of completely open systems by establishing its connection to the unconstrained ensemble .",
    "the description of the unconstrained ensemble presented in this section is based on refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , which the reader is referred to for an extended discussion ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "the energy , volume , and number of particles of a completely open system are quantities that fluctuate due the interaction of the system with its surroundings .",
    "let us consider the probability @xmath1 of the configuration of a system that is found in the state @xmath2 with energy @xmath3 , and possesses @xmath4 particles in a volume @xmath5 .",
    "this probability is an exponential of the form  @xcite @xmath6}{\\upsilon } , \\label{probability}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 are parameters that will be identified below and @xmath10 is the associated partition function given by @xmath11.\\ ] ] here discrete variables are used for simplicity .",
    "the ensemble average @xmath12 of the internal energy @xmath13 is thus obtained as @xmath14 , while the average number of particles @xmath15 and the average volume @xmath16 read @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",

    "hence , using eq .",
    "( [ probability ] ) to express @xmath20 and the condition @xmath21 , eq .",
    "( [ dif_e ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath22-\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}{d}\\bar{n}-\\frac{\\gamma}{\\beta}{d}\\bar{v}. \\label{dif_e_2}\\ ] ] if eq .",

    "therefore , the probability ( [ probability ] ) leads to the correct thermostatistical description of completely open systems .",
    "furthermore , substituting eq .",
    "( [ probability ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ entropy_completely_open ] ) with the previous identifications , one gets @xmath32 where we have introduced the free energy @xmath33 called replica energy  @xcite or subdivision potential  @xcite . by differentiation of eq .",

    "the internal energy and the other thermodynamic potentials are linear homogeneous functions of the extensive variables and thus , from eq .",
    "( [ replica_energy_completely_open ] ) , one obtains @xmath40 , since in this case the gibbs free energy @xmath41 is equal to @xmath42 .",
    "we note that in this case it does not mean that @xmath43 but that @xmath44 is negligible in the thermodynamic limit  @xcite .",
    "thus , for this kind of systems , eq .  ( [ generalized_gibbs_duhem ] ) reduces to the well - known gibbs - duhem equation .",
    "the interesting fact is that equation ( [ replica_energy_completely_open ] ) indicates the route to deal with the more general situation in which the internal energy is not a linear homogeneous function of @xmath45 , @xmath5 , and @xmath4 , as it happens with systems with long - range interactions .",
    "this is the case in which here we are concerned with , for which the replica energy is , in general , different from zero .    the above considerations are directly related to the fact that for an ensemble of @xmath46 replicas of the system with total energy @xmath47 , entropy @xmath48 , volume @xmath49 , and number of particles @xmath50 , @xmath44 can be interpreted as the energy gained by the ensemble when the number of replicas changes holding @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 constant .",
    "formally  @xcite , @xmath54 when the single - system energy @xmath13 is a linear homogeneous function of @xmath45 , @xmath5 , and @xmath4 ( additive systems ) , one has @xmath55 and therefore , eq .  ( [ eq_e ] ) leads to @xmath40 . if @xmath13 is not a linear homogeneous function of @xmath45 , @xmath5 , and @xmath4 ( nonadditive systems ) , eq .",

    "finally , we want to stress that eqs .",
    "( [ replica_energy_completely_open ] ) and ( [ generalized_gibbs_duhem])-([n_relation ] ) are relations at a thermodynamic level .",
    "that is , for any other ensemble , corresponding to the actual physical conditions specified by the given control parameters , an analogous set of equations can be obtained from the appropriate free energy  @xcite .",
    "the replica energy will emerge also in those cases , although it will not be the free energy associated to the partition function for that ensemble .",
    "however , since in any case @xmath44 vanishes when the system is additive , it can always be seen as a measure of the nonadditivity of the system  @xcite .",
    "we introduce here a model that , as discussed in the following , can attain equilibrium configurations under completely open conditions .",
    "consider a system of @xmath4 particles of mass @xmath57 enclosed in a volume @xmath5 with a hamiltonian of the form @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the momentum and position of particle @xmath2 , respectively , @xmath61 is the interaction potential , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 .",

    "hence , the total potential energy in the large @xmath4 limit is given by @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the number of particles in @xmath68 and @xmath74 is the number of particles in @xmath70 for a given configuration .",
    "notice that @xmath75 and @xmath76 , so that @xmath77 depends implicitly on the position of all particles .",
    "this model is a modification of the thirring model  @xcite , which is obtained in the particular case @xmath78 .",
    "furthermore , the model is solvable in the different statistical ensembles , and below we focus on the unconstrained ensemble and compare it with the canonical and grand canonical cases . in the following",
    "it will become clear why we consider this modification of the model .      here",
    "we study the modified thirring model in the unconstrained ensemble .",
