    "the origin of neutrino mass is one of the unsolved issue in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "this mystery could be solved by a higgs triplet extension of the sm called type - ii seesaw model  @xcite .",
    "the novel feature of a type - ii seesaw model is the existence of a doubly charged higgs @xmath5 in the higgs triplet @xmath6 . in the original type - ii seesaw model",
    ", @xmath5 decays into two same - sign charged leptons @xmath7 or w bosons @xmath8 according to the triplet vacuum expectation value ( vev ) when masses in the multiplet are degenerate .",
    "thus the experimental searches of doubly charged higgs bosons have focused on the signals of same - sign dilepton or w bosons  @xcite .    the extension of type - ii seesaw model by including second higgs doublet can lead new effect in doubly charged higgs production and decays  @xcite .",
    "the most attractive new effect is the dimension-3 terms in scalar potential , read by @xmath9 ( j , k = 1,2 ; @xmath10=1,2,3 ) , where @xmath11 is a higgs doublet . since the coefficients @xmath12 can be of order of electroweak ( ew ) scale , the new terms lead a large mixing angle between the singly charged higgs of doublet ( @xmath13 ) and of triplet ( @xmath14 ) .",
