    "the metallicities of high - redshift qsos measured from their broad emission lines are an important probe of the young universe .",
    "these metallicities can be used to infer the properties of the qso host galaxies , and to set limits on the formation of the first stars and supernovae ( see the review by hamann & ferland 1999 ; iwamuro et al .",
    "2002 , dietrich et  al .",
    "the recent discovery of qsos at @xmath4 ( fan et  al .",
    "2001 ; fan et  al .",
    "2003 ) is of particular interest , as under currently favored cosmologies the age of the universe at such redshifts is approximately 1gyr , or only @xmath67% of its current value .",
    "such an age approaches the formation timescale of the type ia supernovae that are the most likely source of qso iron enrichment ( see hamann & ferland 1999 ) .",
    "therefore , qsos at @xmath4 may begin to show significantly lower iron abundances than those at lower redshifts .    with these motivations ,",
    "we have begun to obtain near - infrared spectra of qsos at @xmath4 discovered from the sloan digital sky survey ( see fan et  al .  2001 , 2003 and references therein ) using the near infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos ) of the hubble space telescope .",
    "these nicmos spectra cover a wider wavelength range than is possible from the ground because of telluric absorption .",
    "we are particularly interested in the measurement of the strength of the fe  ii emission complex centered at a laboratory wavelength of 2500 , and the ratio of this emission to that of mg  ii @xmath72800 , as this provides a diagnostic of the abundance ratio of iron to @xmath8-process elements , which in turn is an indicator of the occurrence of sne  ia ( see hamann & ferland 1999 ; thompson et  al.1999 ; iwamuro et  al .",
    "2002 ) .    in this _",
    "letter _ we report the first results from this program",
    ". a detailed discussion of our data reduction procedures and a full modeling of the data are deferred to a later paper . throughout this paper , we assume a cosmology of @xmath9=71kms@xmath10mpc@xmath10 , @xmath11=0.73 , and @xmath12 ( bennett et  al .  2003 ) .",
    "spectra of the three qsos sdss j083643.85 + 005453.3 ( @xmath13 = 5.82 ) , sdss j103027.10 + 052455.0 ( @xmath13 = 6.28 ) , and sdss j104433.04 - 012502.2 ( @xmath13 = 5.78 ) were obtained between 2002 october  25 - 27 using the g141 grism of the nicmos instrument on the hubble space telescope under go program 9413 .",
    "hereafter , we refer to these sources as sdss j1044 - 0125 , sdss j1030 + 0524and sdss j0836 + 0054 .",
    "this grism covers the wavelength range from 1.1@xmath14 to 1.9@xmath14 with a nominal resolution of 200 per pixel .",
    "the final spectra represent the average of four individual spectra centered in each of the four nicmos camera 3 detector quadrants .",
    "their position on the detector was changed in order to minimize the effect of large - scale and intra - pixel sensitivity variations in the detector on the co - added spectra .",
    "the total integration time for each spectrum was 2304 seconds .",
    "the spectra were extracted using the nicmoslook software of freudling ( 1997 ) .",
    "intra - pixel variations show up as a wavy pattern in individual spectra with an amplitude of approximately 8% of the mean flux level .",
    "the effect was corrected for during the extraction .",
    "the wavelength calibration of the spectra was derived from the observations of the planetary nebular hb12 , and the flux calibration is based on the solar analog star p330-e ( freudling 2003 ) using a spectrum kindly provided by rieke ( 2001 ) .",
    "galactic extinction at the position of the qsos is negligible and was not corrected for .",
    "our final spectra are shown in figure  [ spectra ] , plotted as a function of observed and rest - frame wavelengths .",
    "the positions of the c  iii ] @xmath71909 and mg  ii @xmath72800 lines are marked with arrows , and the wavelength range of the main fe  ii uv emission bump is marked with a broad bar .",
    "the noise in the spectra is slightly correlated due to rebinning and flat - fielding uncertainties .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratios of our spectra are about 60 for sdss  j08364 + 0054 and sdss  j1044 - 0125 , and about 30 for sdss  j1030 + 0524 .",
    "each spectrum in figure  [ spectra ] is overplotted with the qso composite spectrum of zheng et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) derived from hst faint object camera observations of objects in the approximate range @xmath15 , shifted to the appropriate redshift .",
    "one can immediately see a basic correspondence between the continuum shapes of all three object spectra and that of the composite spectrum . in sdss j0836 + 0054 and sdss j1044 - 0125",
    "one can also see the presence of the main uv fe  ii emission bump and its correspondence to this feature in the composite .",
    "the detection of the fe ii emission bump in sdss  j1044 - 0125 is consistent with the detection of fe ii emission at @xmath16 3000  reported in this object by aoki , murayama & denda ( 2002 ) .",
    "the spectrum of sdss j1030 + 0524 is more ambiguous .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio of this spectrum is the lowest of the three objects , adding to this uncertainty .",
    "there is an apparent absorption feature at approximately 1.57@xmath14 , which we also see in the four individual spectra , indicating that it is not a detector artifact .",
    "there are no objects nearby the qso whose spectra could have contaminated it .",
    "we thus believe the feature to be real .",
    "it could represent a deep complex of mg  ii @xmath72800 narrow line absorbers at @xmath17 4.6 , or else be intrinsic to the qso .",
    "the latter possibility might explain the apparent lack of strong emission in the fe  ii complex , i.e. , sdss j1030 + 0524 might be related to the rare sub - class of qsos showing fe  ii absorption in their spectra ( see gregg et al .",
    "2002 and references therein ) .",
    "a spectrum with a higher signal - to - noise ratio is required to resolve this uncertainty .",
    "we measure the strength of the detected fe ii emission and its ratio to that in mg  ii @xmath72800 as follows . following an approach first used by wills , netzer & wills ( 1985 ; hereafter wnw85 ) , we use a smoothed version of the composite spectrum of zheng et al .",
    "( 1997 ) as a template of the fe  ii emission complex in the region 2250   2700 and extend it to both longer and shorter wavelengths using the theoretical fe  ii template from wnw85 as a guide .",
    "we then model our nicmos spectra as the combination of a continuum , our uv fe  ii template , and gaussian profiles .",
    "the continuum in our model consists of a power law with slope @xmath18 and a model balmer continuum .",
    "all components are fitted simultaneously .",
    "the mg  ii @xmath72800 line in the qso spectra is fitted by a single gaussian profile , and the @xmath19 line blend that includes c  iii ] @xmath71909 , si iii ] @xmath71892 , and al  iii @xmath71860 is fitted as two gaussian profiles . in the case of sdss j1030 + 0524 , a third broader gaussian profile is added to this blend to accommodate its shape .",
    "the redshift of the qso is a free parameter in the fits , the resulting values are given in table  1 .",
    "fits to each spectrum are shown in figure  [ fit ] .",
    "while it can be seen from the plots that mg  ii @xmath72800 is incompletely covered in the spectra of sdss  j08364 + 0054 and sdss  j1044 - 0125 , the shape of the line profiles suggest that the peak of the lines are within or very close to the wavelength range covered by our spectra",
    ". fits to the blue sides of the profiles therefore allow a reasonable estimate of their total flux . for sdss j1030 + 0524 where mg  ii @xmath72800 is not covered",
    ", we use the ciii ] line blend instead and assume that f(mg  ii)@xmath20f(ciii ] ) .",
    "the factor 1.37 is the mean flux ratio in radio - quiet qsos ( brotherton et  al .",
    "1994 ) .    the main source of uncertainty in the measured f(fe  ii )",
    "is the value of the continuum slope .",
    "we therefore repeat our fitting procedure with different slopes between @xmath21 - 0.30 and -0.36 . for each slope , we judge by eye whether the fitted continuum corresponds to the measured flux values within their error bars and discard those which do not .",
    "two of the remaining fits are shown for each object in figure  [ fit ] .",
    "we compute integrated fluxes f(fe  ii ) and f(mg  ii ) for each of the accepted continuum fits .",
    "we then take half the value of the difference between the maximum and minimum integrated flux as our error estimate .",
    "we note that for all continuum fits accepted during the inspection described above , we obtain a positive value for the integrated flux of the fe  ii uv emission complex in sdss j1030 + 0524 . nevertheless , because of the aforementioned ambiguity in our spectrum of this object",
    ", this value should only be considered an upper limit .    a more accurate measurement of the fe  ii / mg  ii ratio is possible in principle through the use of a fe  ii template derived from the narrow - line qso i  zw  1 ( see boroson & green 1992 ; corbin & boroson 1996 ; vestergaard & wilkes 2001 ) , but given our low spectral resolution , wavelength coverage and relatively low signal - to - noise ratios it is not clear that our data warrant this approach .",
    "however , we will test that method on our complete sample of spectra .    the integrated flux of the fe  ii @xmath72500 complex is generally measured over the wavelength range from 2150 to 3300(e.g .",
    "wnw85 ) , and the continuum fit is performed over the wavelength range from 1500 to 5000 .",
    "our spectra however do not extend out this far in the object rest - frame , and therefore we can only measure the fe  ii emission at wavelengths shorter than the mg  ii line . in order to compare our measurements of the f(fe  ii)/f(mg",
    "ii ) ratios to measurements of the same quantity in qsos at lower redshifts by iwamuro et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) , we computed a scaled version of our fe  ii / mg  ii ratios ,    @xmath22_{\\rm scaled}= s \\times   { [ { \\rm f(fe~ii)/f(mg~ii)}]_{\\rm measured } .   }",
    "\\ ] ]    the scaling factor @xmath23 was derived using our procedure to measure line fluxes on the template spectrum by francis et  al .",
    "( 1991 ) , for which iwamuro et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) have reported a value for fe  ii / mg  ii of 4.26 .",
    "we measure in this spectrum the fe  ii / mg  ii flux ratio using the same wavelength range , continuum regions , line and template fitting as for our nicmos spectra .",
    "the final factor scaling @xmath23 is chosen so that our scaled fe  ii / mg  ii flux ratio for the francis spectrum is identical to the value quoted by iwamuro et  al .",
    "the measured and scaled values of this ratio are given in table  1 . while our measurement of the scaled fe / mg ratio in sdss j1030 + 0524 is highly uncertain , a value near or above where we measure it would be consistent with the results of pentericci et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) , who from an analysis of the lines present in the optical spectrum of this object conclude that that its metallicity is likely to be above the solar value .",
    "our measurement procedure is similar to those used by wnw85 , iwamuro et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and dietrich et al .",
    "our scaling should therefore allow our measurements to be compared with theirs .",
    "in figure  [ fez ] we plot our values in combination with the values listed by iwamuro et  al .",
    "( 2002 , their tables  2 and  3 ) and dietrich et  al .",
    "( 2002 , column `` fe  ii  uv '' of their table  4 ) as a function of redshift .",
    "the shaded region in this plot indicates the flux ratio of @xmath24 expected for solar abundances ( see wnw85 ) .",
    "the figure shows that the measured f(fe  ii)/f(mg  ii ) values are generally at or above this range of values , and more importantly show no trend with redshift over the range @xmath25 .",
    "all the qsos in this combined sample have comparable luminosities .",
    "thus while iwamuro et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) find evidence for some redshift dependence of the fe / mg abundance ratio between high and low - redshift ( @xmath17 0.1 ) qsos , the interpretation of this trend is complicated by the weak dependence of the mg  ii @xmath72800 equivalent width on continuum luminosity , and the wide luminosity range of their sample .",
    "there is thus no compelling evidence of evolution in qso fe / mg abundance ratios from @xmath26 to @xmath27 .",
    "the evidence that the objects in our sample have fe / mg abundance ratios at or above the solar value has several important implications .",
    "first , it supports models which predict that galaxy spheroids can reach solar or super - solar metallicities within @xmath6 1gyr of their formation ( e.g. matteuchi 1994 ; gnedin & ostriker 1997 ; romano et  al .",
    "second , the relationship between mass and metallicity found among local galaxies suggests that the hosts of these objects are very massive ( @xmath28 ) , possibly large elliptical galaxies ( see hamann & ferland 1999 ) .",
    "the presence of such galaxies at @xmath4 would then support scenarios of an early formation epoch of massive galaxies ( e.g. cowie et  al .",
    "1996 ; daddi , cimatti & renzini 2000 , romano et  al .",
    "2002 ) , as opposed to those in which they form via mergers at lower redshifts ( e.g. zepf 1997 ; barger et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "if the high metallicities suggested in our sample objects were produced by sne ia , then our assumed cosmology implies that these supernovae occurred less than 1 gyr after the big bang .",
    "their stellar progenitors must have evolved and gas must have sufficiently mixed before high fe  ii / mg  ii flux ratios are detectable .",
    "matteucci & recchi ( 2001 ) have shown that the formation timescale of sne  ia is strongly dependent on environment , initial mass function , and star formation rate .",
    "only several 100myr after the maximum sne  ia rate does the gas fe / mg abundance ratio reach its solar values ( matteucci 1994 ) .",
    "recent models indicate that the time scale from the formation of sn  ia progenitor stars until the gas has been enriched ranges from 0.5 to 0.8gyr ( friaca & terlevich 1998 ) .",
    "the evidence of enrichment from sne ia at @xmath4 thus indicates that the progenitor stars formed at @xmath5 .",
    "it is interesting to note that this range is similar to the range of re - ionization redshifts derived from the polarization fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background ( bennett et  al .",
    "this would support the suggestion that stars rather than qsos were mainly responsible for reionization ( yan , windhorst & cohen 2002 ) .",
    "it is likely that qsos at @xmath4 have only recently turned on .",
    "this is indicated mainly by their extremely low space density ( see shaver et  al .",
    "1996 ; fan et  al .",
    "haiman & cen ( 2002 ) conclude from the size of the ionized volume that sdss  j1030 + 052 has created in the surrounding neutral intergalactic medium , that it has been emitting at its observed luminosity for only @xmath29 years .",
    "the evidence that star formation and supernovae began much earlier than the nuclear activity in these objects thus argues in favor of models proposing an evolutionary link between nuclear starbursts and the agn phenomenon ( norman & scoville 1988 ; kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ; kawakatu & umemura 2003 ) , as opposed to models in which the formation of supermassive black holes precedes that of galaxies . in the latter scenario ,",
    "one would expect a more constant space density of qsos at high redshifts along with an evolution in qso metallicity ( see loeb 1993a ; 1993b ) .    _",
