    "as continued merging is a central prediction of hierarchical assembly models , much effort has been expended in attempting to detect a decline with redshift in the abundance of well - formed early - type galaxies ( e.g. , i m et  al .",
    "2002 , bell et al .",
    "2003 , treu 2003 ) .",
    "present results are somewhat inconclusive , largely because of the lack of high resolution imaging data for sufficiently large samples , the difficulty disentangling luminosity evolution and changes in the number density , and the effects of large scale structure .",
    "the most comprehensive study to date is the analysis of a very large color - selected sample by bell et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , who suggest that the stellar mass in red galaxies may have increased by a factor 23 between @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",

    "treu et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) , van dokkum et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) and others have attempted to constrain evolution in the fundamental plane ( fp ) differentially with respect to that observed in clusters .",
    "differential tests are less sensitive to selection effects and provide valuable constraints on environmental trends expected in hierarchical models ( e.g. , kauffmann 1996 ) .",
    "furthermore , the fp gives information on the mass - to - light ( @xmath14 ) ratios of galaxies , which can be used to interpret the observed evolution of the luminosity function in terms of the underlying mass function .",
    "again , current results are not yet conclusive .",
    "field and cluster samples with @xmath15 have similar @xmath14 ratios ( kochanek et  al .",
    "2000 ; van dokkum et  al .",
    "2001 ; treu et  al .",
    "2001 ) , but there are indications that differences set in at higher redshift ( treu et  al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "a second development follows the discovery by menanteau , abraham , & ellis ( 2001 ) that @xmath1625% of field early - type galaxies in the hubble deep fields ( hdfs ) show color inhomogeneities such as blue cores , quantified by non - uniformity measures across the resolved hst image .",
    "such abnormalities may indicate recent ( merger - induced ) star formation and , if so , their study offers a possible route to an _ in situ _ mass assembly rate ( benson , ellis , & menanteau 2002 ) .",
    "a key question therefore is the extent to which spectroscopic diagnostics of recent activity are seen in distant early - type galaxies ( e.g. , barger et  al .",

    "spectroscopic observations were conducted at the keck i telescope using the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( oke et  al .",

    "the galaxies were moved along the slit to facilitate sky subtraction .",
    "the latter 12 hour exposures provided the bulk of the data comprising 10 targets .",
    "the instrumental resolution @xmath25  at 8000 .",
    "the spectral coverage is approximately 73009900 .",
    "the data were reduced following standard procedures for dithered multi - slit data ; the reduction of a very similar dataset is explained in detail in van dokkum & stanford ( 2003 ) .",
    "internal kinematics were determined by fitting broadened template star spectra to the galaxy spectra .",
    "fits were performed in real space , since s / n weighting and masking of spectral features is more troublesome in fourier space ( see , e.g. , kelson et  al .",

    ". studies at low redshift have shown that for s / n@xmath28 systematic effects begin to dominate the errors ( e.g. , jrgensen , franx , & kjrgaard 1995 ) , and we find that both the s / n and the formal errors indicate that the exposure time was just sufficient for measuring velocity dispersions of these faint galaxies .      for the fp analysis , effective radii @xmath29 and effective surface brightnesses @xmath30 were determined by fitting 2d @xmath31 models convolved with the psf to the @xmath32 images ( see , e.g. , van dokkum & franx 1996 ; kelson et  al .",
    "2000b ) . the drizzled `` version 2 '' data release of the  ( williams et  al .",
    "1996 ) was used for the analysis .",
    "we used four well exposed , non - saturated stars sampling the full spatial varation of the wfpc2 field to approximate the true psfs .",

    "the observed @xmath32 band closely corresponds to the rest - frame @xmath38 band ; hence we transformed the @xmath32 surface brightnesses to rest - frame @xmath38 using the observed @xmath39 colors , as explained in van dokkum & franx ( 1996 ) .",
    "we determine the mean age of the stellar populations in @xmath40 early - type galaxies from the evolution of the mean @xmath2 ratio ( see franx 1993 ) .",
    "although derivation of absolute ages from morphologically - selected samples is susceptible to progenitor bias ( van dokkum & franx 2001 ) , we can constrain the _ relative _ ages of field galaxies compared to those of cluster galaxies .    as demonstrated by , e.g. ,",
    "treu et al .  (",
    "2001 ) , the evolving @xmath2 ratio can be derived from samples spanning a large redshift range by calculating the offsets of individual galaxies from the prediction of the locally determined fp .",
    "the nearby fp of cluster galaxies has the form @xmath41 in the @xmath38 band ( jrgensen , franx , & kjrgaard 1996 ) , which implies that @xmath42 assuming that early - type galaxies form a homologous family ( faber et al .",
    "1987 ) . further assuming that the fp of distant field early - type galaxies has the same form as that in nearby clusters , the residual from the fp is related to an offset in @xmath2 ratio through    @xmath43    ( see van dokkum et  al .",

    "assuming the same rate of evolution for both samples and using the biweight estimator ( beers , flynn , & gebhardt 1990 ) , we find a systematic offset between the  galaxies and cluster galaxies of @xmath48 in @xmath49 .",
    "assuming a salpeter ( 1955 ) imf and no systematic difference in metallicity , this offset corresponds to an age difference of @xmath50% at @xmath51 .",

    "larger samples are needed to determine the scatter more accurately , and to determine whether there is evolution in the tilt .",
    "the similarity between cluster galaxies and field galaxies is remarkable in light of expectations from hierarchical galaxy formation models , which predict that field galaxies should be substantially younger than cluster galaxies .",

    "[ res.plot ] we show the ultra - deep wfpc2 images of these galaxies , after subtracting the best fitting @xmath31 laws . remarkably , both deviating objects have morphological signatures indicative of recent accretion or mergers .",
    "these features have surface brightness @xmath56 , and are detectable only because of the depth of the hdf images .",
    "none of the other seven galaxies show unambiguous deviations from axisymmetry .",
    "we conclude that there is tantalizing evidence for recent mass growth in the population of @xmath10 early - type galaxies .",
    "note that these anomalous objects were _ not _ excluded from the field vs.  cluster comparison in   3 , although the @xmath2 ratios of these galaxies are highly uncertain ( in particular for galaxy 17 ) .",
    "whereas @xmath2 ratios are sensitive to the luminosity weighted mean age of stellar populations , age - sensitive spectral diagnostics such as the h@xmath6 absorption line provide information on the presence of ( small amounts of ) young stars ( e.g. , barger et  al . 1996 ) . in fig .  [ coadd.plot ]",

    "the mean spectrum clearly reveals prominent balmer absorption lines in addition to weak 727  emission , in striking contrast to the color - selected , lower redshift sdss spectrum .",
    "the equivalent widths are @xmath62 and @xmath63()@xmath64 , using bandpass definitions of fisher et  al .",
    "uncertainties were derived by bootstrap resampling ; we note that balmer absorption lines at levels consistent with the average value can be detected in almost all individual spectra , albeit with lower significance ( errors @xmath65 ; table 1 ) .",
    "our small sample of  galaxies tells a complex tale : the similarity of the @xmath2 ratios with those of cluster galaxies on one hand contrasts with evidence for recent accretion and star formation on the other .",
    "the balmer absorption strength of @xmath66  is remarkably high , and exceeds the expectation from simple passive evolution of a single age population : taking @xmath67 as the formation epoch of stars in cluster and field galaxies ( van dokkum & franx 2001 , and  3 ) , the vazdekis ( 1999 ) models predict @xmath68  for galaxies viewed at @xmath69 .",
    "our results can be explained consistently by postulating that a substantial fraction of the  galaxies experienced some recent star formation , but that the bulk of the stellar mass was formed at redshifts @xmath8 .",
    "we used the vazdekis ( 1999 ) models to generate composite spectra consisting of a pre - existing , 2.8gyr old population containing the bulk of the stellar mass and a low mass young component of varying age .",
    "such models naturally produce strong effects in the h@xmath6 line and only modest changes in @xmath70 . as an example ,",
    "a 0.5gyr old secondary star burst containing @xmath71% of the total stellar mass gives @xmath72  and @xmath73 , entirely consistent with the observations .",
    "we note that similar models have been proposed for nearby early - type galaxies by trager et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "it is difficult to unambiguously identify the physical origin of recent star formation in the  galaxies .",
    "tidal features detected in two galaxies argue that at least in some cases the cause may be a merger or the capture of a satellite .",
    "the small mass associated with the young component argues against major mergers of gas - rich disk systems in the redshift interval @xmath74 .",
    "mergers between bulge - dominated , gas - poor systems are much more difficult to constrain , as they would not have a large effect on the @xmath2 ratios and do not develop well defined tidal tails ( e.g. , barnes 1988 ) .",
    "such mergers have been observed in clusters ( e.g. , van dokkum et  al .",
    "1999 ) , and were recently invoked to explain the inferred evolution of the luminosity density of red field galaxies ( bell et al .",
    "2003 ) .    of course",
    ", we can not yet exclude the possibility that the small sample is special .",
    "the stacked spectrum of 15 `` old '' extremely red objects ( ero ) presented by cimatti et  al . (",
    "2002 ) shows no evidence for enhanced balmer absorption , suggesting significant variation in the properties of @xmath10 early - type galaxies depending perhaps on how they are selected . only by correlating morphologies , @xmath14 ratios , colors and spectral features of large samples",
