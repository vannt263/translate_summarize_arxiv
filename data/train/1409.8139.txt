    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is now firmly accepted as the theory of strong interactions .",
    "it is well tested not only at high energy , where qcd couples weakly , but also at low energy , where qcd becomes strongly interacting . in practice , however , qcd is notoriously hard to solve directly to describe the properties of hadrons such as mass spectrum , form factors , or other matrix elements , which are intrinsically nonperturbative .",
    "understanding the low - energy physics of hadrons in terms of qcd still remains to be a great challenge . in recent years , however , the lattice qcd has progressed enormously to simulate with parameters such as the light quark masses very close to physical values in describing the properties of hadrons , whose analytic understanding is therefore pressing .",
    "another development to understand low - energy qcd has been made recently in string theory .",
    "recent study of string theory has shown that a strongly coupled conformal field theory ( cft ) is dual to a weakly interacting gravity in anti - de sitter ( ads ) space in the limit of large degrees of freedom , which is known as ads / cft correspondence .",
    "this finding leads to a new possibility of solving qcd in a certain limit , if one finds the holographic dual of qcd .",
    "several models for holographic qcd were proposed and were shown to be quite successful in describing the properties of hadrons  @xcite .",
    "holographic qcd deals directly with hadrons as basic degrees of freedom and the dynamics of hadrons is determined by the gauge / gravity duality prescription , found in string theory when both the number of colors , @xmath2 , and the t hooft coupling , @xmath4 , are very large .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the electromagnetic contributions to the hadron masses in the sakai - sugimoto model of holographic qcd  @xcite , which is constructed from a type a string theory with d4-d8 branes to provide a successful effective theory of hadrons , consistent with qcd  @xcite .",
    "calculating accurately the electromagnetic mass is quite important , since it is vital to determine the precise value of the light quark masses from the hadron spectrum .",
    "fortunately , the lattice calculation on the electromagnetic contributions to hadron mass has been progressed a lot to accurately determine the electromagnetic mass of hadrons  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we provide a holographic estimate of the electromagnetic mass of hadrons , which will be complementary to the lattice results .",
    "one of the successes of qcd is that it naturally explains why low - lying mesons like pions and kaons are much lighter than baryons .",
    "qcd with three ( light ) flavors has a chiral symmetry , @xmath5 in the massless limit , which is predicted to be spontaneously broken to @xmath6 due to the strong dynamics of qcd .",
    "pions and kaons are then identified as the nambu - goldstone bosons associated with the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry . by goldstone theorem , the nambu - goldstone bosons are massless when the chiral symmetry is exact .",
    "however , the chiral symmetry is only approximate in qcd due to the current quark mass and also electroweak interactions , which then makes pions and kaons massive , but much lighter than baryons .    when a continuous global symmetry , @xmath7 , is spontaneously broken to its subgroup @xmath8 and also intrinsically broken to @xmath9 , the orientation of the true vacuum should be selected or aligned to minimize the vacuum energy , induced by the intrinsic breaking .",
    "provided that the intrinsic breaking is perturbative , the potential for the vacuum orientation @xmath10 is given to the lowest order as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a @xmath7-rotated vacuum of qcd and @xmath13 is the hamiltonian that breaks @xmath7 intrinsically . instead of rotating the vacuum , one might rotate the external perturbation , @xmath14 then the minimization of the vacuum energy becomes tantamount to finding the direction of the symmetry - breaking hamiltonian in the basis of the unperturbed vacuum . finding the vacuum alignment due to the intrinsic breaking was studied by dashen  @xcite for the chiral symmetry breaking in strong interactions and subsequently by weinberg  @xcite in a generalized context of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "later it has been applied to calculate masses of nambu - goldstone bosons in technicolor  @xcite .",
    "there are two sources for the intrinsic breaking of chiral symmetry in qcd .",
    "one is current quark mass and the other is the electroweak interaction . at the leading order in perturbation the vacuum alignment by both current quark mass and electroweak interactions can be treated independently . in this paper",
    "we study the vacuum alignment due to the electromagnetic interaction and calculate the electromagnetic corrections to the pion mass in holographic qcd .",
    "the vacuum alignment in holographic qcd due to the current quark mass has been studied previously  @xcite .    the vacuum energy density due to the electromagnetic interaction",
    "is given in the leading order as ( see fig .

    "however , in the large @xmath2 and large @xmath31 limit , where qcd is described by its gravity dual , called holographic qcd , the correlators of flavor currents are easily calculated by gauge / gravity duality .",
    "the holographic qcd is described in general by a five - dimensional chern - simons - yang - mills theory for the flavor symmetry of qcd , the boundary gauge theory , @xmath32+s_{\\rm cs}\\ , , \\label{action}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the 5d chern - simons action , that reproduces the qcd flavor anomaly , and the fifth coordinate @xmath34 corresponds to the holographic direction with a warp factor , parameterized by @xmath35 and @xmath36 . in the case of sakai - sugimoto model , that we will focus on in the paper , @xmath37 , taking the kaluza - klein scale @xmath3 to be the unit of the scale , and @xmath38 .",
