    "then , we consider an isolated pair of ghess at a single boundary in sec .",
    "[ subsec : semi ] and finally analyze the case of a finite width ribbon both analytically and numerically ( sec .  [ subsec : twoedges ] ) .",
    "[ conclusions ] summarizes the paper and the appendices give various technical details .",
    "in this section , we discuss the ghess phenomenologically .",
    "ghess can be modelled as two counterpropagating one - dimensional ( 1d ) states with linear dispersion relations @xmath1 , i.e. @xmath2 as in refs .  .",

    "consistent with these facts , schmidt _",
    "@xcite introduced the following expansion for small @xmath16 : @xmath17 where the spin - quantization axis is chosen such that at the band crossing point @xmath18 , we have @xmath19 and @xmath20 as in fig .  [",

    "in other words , a constant rotation of all the spins regardlessly of @xmath6 has been removed from @xmath12 in eq.([eq : bk ] ) following ref .  .",
    "such a @xmath6-independent rotation corresponds to a constant rotation matrix and can be removed by choosing a rotated basis for the spin .",

    ", we also evaluate the total spin rotation of the edge states , which we define as @xmath22 here @xmath23 is a fixed reference momentum and the integration is over the range of @xmath6-space , where the edge states exist . the idea behind @xmath24",
    "is to quantify the total variation of the spin orientation of the edge state @xmath25 over all relevant @xmath6 .",
    "we have constructed @xmath24 such that if @xmath25 is a he s ( i.e.  @xmath26 ) , then @xmath27 . likewise ,",
    "if the spin of @xmath25 is rotated by the same amount for all @xmath6 , then we still get @xmath27 .",
    "this is due to the reference term @xmath28 with an arbitrary , but fixed , momentum @xmath23 . in our calculations , we choose @xmath23 to be the momentum where the edge state dispersion cross the upper bulk band gap edge . in the cases we have analyzed",
    ", the reference term @xmath29 is very close to one and quite unaffected by small changes in @xmath23 .",
    "however , generally the choice of @xmath23 does affect the numerical value of @xmath24 , but not its variation versus some physical parameter .",
    "the behaviour of the spin rotation is more complex for a ribbon than for a single edge , especially for narrower ribbons , as the edge state wave function can have components on both edges .",
    "the quantity @xmath24 is useful in that case as this kind of behaviour is difficult to capture with the parameter @xmath21 , which quantifies the rotation close to @xmath18 .",

    "we consider a simple 1d model hamiltonian for a pair of hess with a generic linear spin - orbit coupling , i.e. @xmath30 here @xmath31 , are the pauli matrices and @xmath32 are the spin - orbit coupling strengths . by diagonalization",
    ", we see that this often used @xcite simple model does not introduce a @xmath6-dependent @xmath12 , since all matrix elements are linear in momentum @xmath6",
    ". thereby , it does not give rise to energy - dependent spin - orientation and to ghess , i.e.  @xmath27 .",
    "this is consistent with the lack of the lowest order inelastic backscattering due to a linear spin - orbit coupling combined with a phonon exchange.@xcite in order to get non - trivial ghess , we resort to calculations for the realistic bhz model with rsoc .",
    "the bhz model is an effective four band model describing the basic physics of a 2d ti.@xcite it was derived using @xmath33 theory for the band structure of a hgte qw and therefore valid for small wavevectors @xmath34 , i.e.  close to the @xmath35 point .",
    "it accounts correctly for the physics of hgte qws close to the critical well thickness , which marks the transition between a normal semiconductor band structure and an inverted band structure with topologically protected edge states.@xcite the bhz hamiltonian consists of two disconnected blocks connected by time reversal symmetry .",
    "each block has the form of a massive dirac model in 2d in addition to quadratic terms crucial for the band inversion and thereby the topological properties of the material .",
    "in fact , the dirac - like nature makes the bhz model rather generic for 2d tis  even though it grew out of a specific material choice .",
    "the bhz basis states consist of two kramer pairs of electron - like , @xmath36 , and hole - like , @xmath37 , states , respectively .",
    "the states labeled with @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) are often referred to as the spin - up ( spin - down ) , since they have positive ( negative ) total angular momentum projection.@xcite in this sense , the time - reversed blocks of the bhz model have opposite spin . in the basis @xmath40 , the bhz hamiltonian is @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",

    "importantly , the rsoc couples the two blocks of @xmath48 such that the axial spin symmetry is broken . here , we include only the most important rsoc linear in momentum , i.e. @xmath49 and therefore our full hamiltonian is @xmath50 .",
    "interestingly , the rashba term in @xmath51 only couples the electron - like bands , which makes our model more complex than the simple @xmath52 model hamiltonian in eq.([eq : simplest - case ] ) .",
    "moreover , ghes are now possible as we shall see below .",
    "the strength of the rsoc , @xmath53 , depends of the amount of sia , which is often related to an internal or external electric field . for a hgte qw one can control the rsoc with an external field,@xcite whereas it is an internal field for inas / gasb double qws.@xcite rothe _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite also derives higher order rsoc terms in momentum as we briefly discuss in appendix [ app : higher - order - rashba ] .",
    "the hgte has a zincblende crystal structure such that inversion symmetry of the crystal is lacking .",
    "therefore , bulk - inversion - asymmetric terms can in principle be included,@xcite but are often disregarded due to their small size.@xcite however , in inas / gasb double qws bia terms are in fact significant,@xcite so our calculations for this system without bia terms are not an attempt to model the real system in detail .",
    ".the bhz model parameters for two qw systems in the topological regime.@xcite the parameters for the hgte qw correspond to a well width of 7 nm , while the values for the inas / gasb double qws are for equal widths of 10 nm for both wells .",

    "it is possible to obtain the hess analytically for both an isolated edge and a ribbon with two edges.@xcite in the appendix [ appendix : hes ] , we give the details of the analytical wave functions and dispersion relations of the hess in both cases . including the rsoc , it becomes much more challenging to obtain exact analytical forms by the same method , since it is now a problem with four coupled differential equations , see appendix [ subsec : hes - derivation ] .",
    "nevertheless , we are able to obtain analytical results by assuming that the ghess with rsoc are combinations of the hess without rsoc , neglecting the possible contribution of the bulk bands . this is a good approximation , since the edge states naturally have a small spatial overlap with the bulk states as long as the edge states are well - localized at the boundary .",

    "there is one spinor from each time - reversed block of the bhz model , i.e. @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) only has non - zero components on the two first ( last ) entries with positive ( negative ) total angular momentum projection .",

    "we neglect the matrix elements between the edge and bulk states .",
    "these are presumably very small , since bulk and edge states to a very large extend are spatially separated .",

    "we show that the second order term does not contribute to @xmath92 , while the third order term in principle could contribute even though we face technical difficulties in this case due to the hard wall boundary condition used to find the hess analytically .",
    "however , the third order rsoc term can not introduce terms of a different order in @xmath76 in @xmath91 than the ones found here .",
    "therefore it can not change the physics of the ghess discussed below .",
    "moreover , the magnitude of the effects of the third order term can partly be incorporated into the prefactor @xmath53 .",
    "the form of @xmath93 in eq.([eq : full - non - diagonal - h ] ) is clearly very similar to the simple 1d hamiltonian for a pair of hess with a generic spin - orbit coupling eq.([eq : simplest - case ] ) , since the effective spin - orbit term @xmath94 resembles @xmath95 .",

    "we found the transverse wave function @xmath278 analytically using the simple hard - wall boundary condition that @xmath431 ( see appendix [ subsec - appendix : hes - isolated - boundary ] and refs .  ) .",
    "this produce an artificial discontinuity in the derivative of @xmath278 at the boundary @xmath430  just as for the textbook example of an infinitely deep square well .",
    "it is this discontinuity that gives the incorrect non - zero matrix element at @xmath107 . for any smooth boundary potential ( or a finite step potential )",
    ", @xmath432 would be zero at the boundary of the integral ( not necessarily at @xmath430 ) and thereby give the correct result .",
    "unfortunately , it is hard to obtain analytical wave functions for these potentials . in other words",
    ", we seem to get a non - zero result due to our crude approximation for the transversal wave function .",
    "however , for integrals involving only the first order derivatives of @xmath281 as in the main text , we can still use the hess in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hes_single_edge_app ] ) in our analytical approach .",
    "a similar situation is found in the use of @xmath433 theory to describe confined structures by the envelope function approximation . here",
    "hard - wall boundaries are often used to describe structures in accordance with experimental observations , even though the envelope function approximation in principle requires smooth potentials .",
