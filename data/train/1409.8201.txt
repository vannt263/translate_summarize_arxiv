    "the rapid , complex , high amplitude and broadband ( radio to @xmath0-rays ) variability is a defining characteristic of a class of radio - loud active galactic nuclei ( agn ) called blazars .",
    "these observed properties are believed to be a result of relativistic motion of non - thermal plasma along the jet , oriented at small angles to the observer s line of sight @xcite .",
    "the erratic variability combined with the complexity of organizing simultaneous multi - band observations and limitations of modern telescopes to resolve the emitting region makes multi - band variability studies and correlations as important tools to infer the underlying physical processes and the environment of agns .",
    "a detailed and systematic study of temporal and spectral features in different energy bands can offer a potential diagnostic for understanding the radiation mechanisms and underlying physical processes .",
    "for @xmath0-ray bright agns with good photon statistics , the broadband energy coverage and continuous operation of _ fermi_-lat offer a unique opportunity to extract multi - waveband light - curves down to scanning timescale of @xmath2 hours ( see @xcite for more details ) , making such a study feasible at @xmath0-ray energies .    the radiative output of high luminosity blazars , particularly the flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs )",
    "is mostly dominated by @xmath0-ray emission in the gev regime and beyond in some cases @xcite .",
    "this emission is generally explained as a result of inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of photons external to the jet by non - thermal electrons @xcite , commonly referred as external compton ( ec ) .",
    "two sites one at sub - parsec scales and another at parsec scales , have been suggested for dominant @xmath0-ray emission / contribution @xcite . on sub - parsec scales ( @xmath3 1 pc ) ,",
    "@xmath0-ray emission is due to the ec scattering of photons from broad line region ( blr ) and/or accretion - disk @xcite , while on parsec scales the ec scattering of infrared ( ir ) photons from the putative molecular / dusty torus can be dominant .",
    "the sub - parsec scenario has been very successful in explaining the observed sed and short time @xmath0-ray variability of blazars until very recently .",
    "however , the latest radio and @xmath0-ray correlation studies @xcite favor parsec scenario in most cases with further support from the detection of fsrqs at very high energies ( vhe ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the parsec scale scenario ; however , particle acceleration , bulk velocity , and emission regions associated with short time variability of few minutes to hours are matters of ongoing debate due to its larger distance from the central engine @xcite .",
    "most of the studies till date have relied on spectral features @xcite and constraints from @xmath0-ray opacity to infer the underlying mechanisms , seed photons and hence the location of emission sites in blazars @xcite .",
    "however , spectral information from @xmath0-ray emission is subject to klein - nishina ( kn ) softening , pair production and presence of intrinsic features in the particle spectra , making gev emission and underlying processes hard to disentangle @xcite .",
    "moreover , if the underlying physical processes ( particle acceleration and injection ) are evolving faster than the cooling timescales , as suggested by the observations in cases of high luminosity blazars @xcite , spectral information averaged over a longer duration data may lead to false inferences regarding these processes .",
    "high time resolution study of spectral , timing and variability features though , can be used to infer these timescales and their relative dominance , at least for bright sources .",
    "this , in fact , can also differentiate between multiple injections / emission - regions which on larger timescales seem coherent otherwise @xcite .",

    "enhancements were also seen by other observatories operating at similar / different energy - bands @xcite . during this period the source showed two prominent @xmath0-ray flares ( @xmath5ph @xmath6 s@xmath7 ) : one in april 2010 @xcite and another in june 2010 @xcite , the brightest so far in lat band from this source . a detailed investigation of lat data during april flare confirmed vhe emission leading to the inclusion of pks 1222 + 216 in the lat vhe catalog . during this high @xmath0-ray activity period ,",

    "observatory one immediately after the end of the april flare on mjd 55319.97 @xcite and other one during the rising part of the june 2010 flare @xcite establishing pks 1222 + 216 as a potential vhe fsrq .",
    "first two years of _",
    "fermi_-lat observations of pks 1222 + 216 have been analyzed by @xcite by dividing the lat light - curve in different activity states based on the observed @xmath0-ray variability of the source .",
    "they have further performed a detailed investigation of the lat data for the time period considered in this paper ( the _ active _ state of @xcite ) , focusing particularly on the spectral evolution , @xmath0-ray emission and energetics of the source during its different activity states . based on the spectral fit of lat spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and",
    "the stability of the break energy during its various activity states , the authors argued that the break can be well explained by recombination in the blr as suggested by @xcite .",
    "however , ec scattering of blr photons ( lyman-@xmath8 ) to vhe lies in the kn regime , making vhe emission extremely inefficient with a significant emission only up to few 10s of gev @xcite .",

    "details of _ fermi_-lat data and its reduction procedures are discussed in section [ sec : data ] . in section [ sec : result ] , we present the main results obtained from the lat analysis , with its implications on blazar emission and underlying physical processes being discussed in section [ sec : discussion ] . finally we summarize our finding in section [ sec : conclude ] .",

    "fermi_-lat observations [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : sedpar ]    based on lag and correlated - variability , both homogeneous and inhomogeneous model have been suggested for blazars emission and have been successful in reproducing the observed sed and light - curves of the sources .",
    "simple one - zone models have been found to satisfactorily reproduce the broadband sed during both the flares .",
    "however , the rise and fall within a day , during _ flare 1 _ , suggests that it probably arises from a @xmath16 day long emission region as suggested by a similar rise time in all the lat energy bands minutes variability considered by @xcite based on the vhe variability observed during _ flare 2 _ ] .",
    "an indication of this daily variation is also apparent in the 13 gev emission before rise .",
    "moreover , contrary to this variation in 13 gev emission , the 0.31 gev emission suggests faster variation and has slowest rise and fall compared to the other two energy bands ( table [ tab : trtf ] ) . for _ flare 2 _ ,",
    "various models including leptonic scenarios e.g. jet - in - jet / minijet , recollimation and multiple emission zones along with hadronic scenario of ultra - relativistic neutral beams @xcite have been proposed .",
    "however , the temporal features seen in the systematic time and energy resolved study performed here demand scenarios beyond simple one zone homogeneous models where minor fluctuations are embedded within the region contributing to the major flare .",
    "the two flares considered here have been studied earlier by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "both the previous studies focus on the spectral and temporal features in the 0.1300 gev energy band employing different time binning method . in this work , however , we have a performed a more detailed and systematic time and energy resolved study .",
    "we have shown that all the features / patterns observed during _ flare 2 _ by @xcite are mainly due to features present at lower energies .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand have termed these two flares as the highest possible @xmath0-ray fluxes from pks 1222 + 216 , supposedly fueled by feeding the entire accretion power to the jet . however , the observed peak luminosity ( @xmath17 ) which reaches @xmath18 erg s@xmath7 during the peak corresponds to an emitted power of @xmath19 erg s@xmath7 @xcite in the rest frame of the emission region , assuming a bulk lorentz factor ( @xmath20 ) of 20 @xcite .",
    "this is @xmath21 of the accretion disk luminosity @xmath22 erg s@xmath7 @xcite and is in contrast to @xmath23 derived by @xcite , who assumed a comparatively lower value for the accretion disk luminosity @xmath24 erg s@xmath7 ( assuming a blr covering fraction @xmath25 ) and jet bulk lorentz factor @xmath26 . a black hole of mass @xmath27 @xcite , however , can produce an eddington luminosity of @xmath28 erg s@xmath7 which in turn suggests a very high accretion power and disk radiative efficiency . apart from the asymmetry observed in the light - curves of the flares , @xcite found a hint of `` harder - when - brighter '' during _ flare 1 _ and a clockwise evolution in spectral index vs flux during _ flare 2_. our analysis also reproduces these results but we found a clockwise trend during _ flare 1 _ as well , which is present in the study of @xcite but was probably suppressed due to the inclusion of a flare preceding the _",
    "we have performed an in - depth time and energy resolved study of the two brightest @xmath0-ray flares from fsrq pks 1222 + 216 observed by the _",
    "fermi_-lat during april ( _ flare 1 _ ) and june ( _ flare 2 _ ) 2010 .",
    "our study reveals a large variety of temporal features and variability patterns in different energy bands ( 0.13 , 0.10.3 , 0.3 - 1.0 and 13 gev ) binned on 6 hr timescales apart from a clearly asymmetric profile in both the flares .",
    "this includes a @xmath1 day plateau in 0.10.3 gev band , hint of variation on daily timescale in 13 gev emission , faster fluctuation ( @xmath29 days ) at 0.31 gev energy and a rapid decline during _",
    "flare 1_. _ flare 2 _ , on the contrary , shows a monotonic rise followed by a gradual decline at all energies with prominent substructures in 0.10.3 gev emission .",
    "though the rise time are similar in all energy bands during both the flares , the slower rise of daily integrated 0.1300 gev light - curve during _ flare 1 _ is probably due to the presence of plateau in the 0.10.3 gev emission with @xmath30 gev photons driving the initial rise .",
    "further , the slower decline of 0.1300 gev light - curve during _ flare 2 _ is mainly due to contribution from the multiple peaked sub - structures in the 0.10.3 gev light - curve resulting in a coherent single flare at daily timescales .",
    "sed during both the flares can be well reproduced by a simple one zone model considering synchrotron , ssc and ec of ir emission mechanisms with similar parameters .",
    "the radiative cooling timescale of @xmath31 min suggest that the observed duration and profiles of flares are not solely due to radiative cooling .",
    "the decline of flares also can not be explained by considering light travel time effect which results in a similar decline rate at all energies , contrary to observations .",
    "study of hardness ratios during both the flares suggest that _ flare 1 _ can result from a variation in the efficiency of underlying acceleration process whereas for _ flare 2 _ , one need to consider the effect of jet dynamics and small scale inhomogeneities .",
    "the former contribute to overall flaring while the latter is responsible for the intrinsic feature observed in the time and energy resolved light - curves presented here . based on these features we suggest that both flares are probably result of two different underlying mechanisms that are equally efficient in producing luminous @xmath0-ray flares .",
    "the _ fermi_-lat collaboration acknowledges generous ongoing support from a number of agencies and institutes that have supported both the development and the operation of the lat as well as scientific data analysis .",
