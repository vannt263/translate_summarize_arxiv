    "excitonic polaritons are quasiparticles made up from strongly coupled electron - hole pairs and photons@xcite .",
    "they are experimentally realized in semiconductor optical microcavities with embedded quantum wells .",
    "the small volume of the microcavity , high reflectivity of its walls , and quasiresonance condition between the confined - photon and excitonic energies guarantee the strong coupling regime .    at very - low excitation rates , in mean only a single quasiparticle lives inside the cavity . with increasing excitation power , however , an abrupt increase of ground - state occupation takes place due to the quasibosonic statistics of the polaritons .",
    "a threshold behaviour of the photoluminescence is observed .",
    "this behaviour has been interpreted as bose - einstein condensation of polaritons @xcite or as a dynamical effect ( polariton lasing)@xcite .",
    "the latter position is motivated by the experimental demonstration that thermalization mechanisms are not effective .    in the present paper , we start from the idea of the polariton laser @xcite , where pumping provides a reservoir from which the low - lying polariton states are populated . unlike common lasers ,",
    "no population inversion is required and the active medium ( the excitons ) is strongly interacting with the cavity photons , forming the quasibosonic polaritons .",
    "the theoretical description of polaritons faces the difficulties inherent to a many - particle strongly - interacting system working under a non - equilibrium pumping regime .",
    "our strategy to tackle this problem is based upon two simplifications .",
    "first , we consider a finite system @xcite , that is a single photon mode , and a finite number of single - particle states ( ten ) for electrons and holes .",
    "then , the electron - hole - photon many - particle hamiltonian is numerically diagonalized in order to find the energies and wavefunctions of the system .",
    "we stress that both coulomb and electron - hole - photon interactions are treated exactly in our scheme .",
    "second , we compute the stationary density matrix from a master equation which accounts for photon losses through the cavity mirrors and pumping . the master equation is solved in a truncated set of many - particle states . notice that these simplifications preserve the main ingredients of the problem : the existence of fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom , the strong coupling between them , the existence of a finite number of single - particle states for fermions ( around @xmath0 in ref .",

    "the active medium inside the cavity is described by a finite number of harmonic - oscillator states for electrons and holes , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1n ] .",
    "the number of single - particle states ( ten ) is dictated only by practical reasons : the dimension of the many - particle hilbert space grows exponentially with the number of states .",
    "this finite system could be a good model for a quantum dot inside a thin micropillar , and even could be used to obtain the qualitative behaviour of quantum well - based micropillars .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian includes electron - electron , hole - hole , and electron - hole coulomb interactions as well as electron - hole - photon coupling , the latter in the rotating - wave approximation @xcite :    @xmath1    the effective band gap , @xmath2 , is taken as 1500 mev for gaas .",
    "@xmath3 is the detuning of the photon mode with respect to @xmath2 .",

    "to set it in a different way , population inversion in these systems is not synonym of effectively weak pair - photon coupling .",
    "these results could be related to the small number of available states for fermions or the chosen values of the system parameters ,",
    "but anyway they illustrate aspects of principle .",
    "in figs . [ fig11n ] and [ fig12n ] , we show the mean number of polaritons , @xmath88 , the mean number of pairs , @xmath137 , and the coherence properties of the photon and matter subsystems in the quasi - resonant and in the positive detuning case , respectively .",
    "we define the second - order coherence functions for photons and electron - hole pairs in terms of the one- and two - point correlation functions at zero time delay :    @xmath138    @xmath139    where @xmath140 is the photon annihilation operator , and @xmath141 is the interband dipole operator .",
    "the coherence functions evolve from values larger than two at low pumping rates to values near one ( poisson statistics , perfectly coherent state ) immediately after the threshold .",
    "notice that the electron - hole subsystem reaches coherence more rapidly than photons ( @xmath142 ) possibly because of coulomb interactions .",
    "for large values of @xmath58 , we get @xmath143 .",
    "notice also that , in the resonant case , there is a pumping rate for which both @xmath144 and @xmath145 are approximately equal to one .",
    "this is the point of maximum coherence , and corresponds to a minimum of the linewidth .    in the positive detuning case",
    ", the minimum of the linewidth is reached at the point where @xmath144 has a local maximum . for low pumping rates , @xmath88 and @xmath137",
    "are very similar .",
    "they start differing precisely at the polariton lasing threshold , where the population of fermions is inverted .",
    "in conclusion , we have computed the stationary density matrix , the photoluminescence spectral function , and the second - order coherence functions in a model polariton system describing a multi - level quantum dot strongly interacting with the lowest photon mode of a microcavity .",
    "the main features of polariton lasing , i.e. blueshift of the emission peak and increase of the linewidth as the pumping rate is rised , are reproduced by the model .",
    "unexpected properties , such as the coexistence of polariton lasing and population inversion for positive detuning , are also manifested .    our polariton model with a finite number of degrees of freedom ,",
    "could be positioned in between the two - level system , studied in ref . , and the infinite degrees of freedom systems considered , for example , in refs .",
    "our model is simple enough to be numerically diagonalized but , at the same time , complex enough to capture many of the features of the infinite system . in this sense , our results",
    "could be qualitatively compared with the experiment reported in ref . , although the values of our model parameters are completely unrealistic .    finally , we should stress that we are aware of the limitations of our model .",
    "we understand , for example , that @xmath146 does not rise further in the regime of strong pumping because the model does not include higher fermionic levels , which should become populated in this regime , that interact with the lowest polariton states , partially destroying coherence .",
