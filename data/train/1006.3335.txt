    "quasi - particles formed collectively by plasmons and polaritons bound to the interface of a metal and a dielectric material are called surface plasmon - polaritons ( spps )  @xcite . although spps are quantum objects , trains of spps traveling along the interface are classically viewed as spp waves .",
    "much recent literature is devoted to the exploitation of spp waves for diverse technological purposes , including sensing , imaging , and communications @xcite .",
    "this technoscientific ferment is due to a resonance phenomenon that arises when the energy carried by photons in the dielectric material is transferred to free electrons in the metal at that interface , and vice versa .",
    "different dielectric materials will become differently polarized on interrogation by an electromagnetic field , thereby enabling a widely used technique for sensing chemicals and biochemicals @xcite .",
    "furthermore , spp imaging systems are used for high - throughput analysis of biomolecular interactions  for proteomics , drug discovery , and pathway elucidation @xcite .",
    "spp - based imaging technology has been successfully applied to the screening of bioaffinity interactions with dna , carbohydrates , peptides , phage display libraries , and proteins @xcite .",
    "spp - based imaging techniques are also going to be useful for lithography @xcite .",
    "finally , as spp waves can be excited in the terahertz and optical regimes , they may be useful for high - speed information on computer chips @xcite .",
    "whereas conventional wires are very attenuative at frequencies beyond a few tens of ghz , ohmic losses are minimal for plasmonic transmission @xcite which enables long - range communications @xcite .",
    "even a cursory perusal of literature will show that only one spp wave at a specific frequency is excited along the interface , if the partnering dielectric material is homogeneous .",
    "but if this material were to be periodically nonhomogeneous in the direction normal to the interface , the number of spp waves  of different phase speeds , attenuation rates , and field structures , but the same frequency  can be higher",
    ". the material can be isotropic @xcite or anisotropic @xcite , the latter obviously providing more options due to birefringence @xcite .",
    "the possibility of exciting multiple spp waves provides exciting prospects for enhancing the scope of the applications of spp waves . for sensing applications",
    ", the use of more than one distinct spp waves would increase confidence in a reported measurement ; also , more than one analyte could be sensed at the same time , thereby increasing the capabilities of multi - analyte sensors . for imaging applications , the simultaneous creation of two images may become possible . for plasmonic communications , the availability of multiple channels would make information transmission more reliable as well as enhance capacity .",
    "these possibilities are promised by the use of sculptured thin films  ( stfs ) as the partnering dielectric material .",
    "stfs are anisotropic and unidirectionally nonhomogeneous thin films whose permittivity profile has been nanoengineered during the physical vapor deposition process  @xcite .",
    "the possibility of multiple spp waves localized to the single interface of a metal and a periodically nonhomogeneous sculptured nematic thin film ( sntf ) has been demonstrated both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "an sntf is a special type of an stf  with a permittivity profile which is sculptured , during physical vapor deposition , only in one plane called the morphologically significant plane @xcite .",
    "also , spp wave propagation along the interface of a metal and a chiral stf has also been shown both theoretically  @xcite and experimentally  @xcite to admit more than one type of spp waves .",
    "a further increase in the number of spp waves would require the use of multiple parallel metal / dielectric interfaces , which is already established well with isotropic dielectric materials @xcite .",
    "pursuing this line of thinking , we decided to solve the canonical problem of wave propagation localized to a sufficiently thin metallic slab inserted in an sntf .",
