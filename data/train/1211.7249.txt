    "<S> we study the implications of coupling langmuir kinetics ( lk ) process with the dynamics of an extending lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the model that we consider couples dynamically extending exclusion process ( deep ) with the process of random attachment and detachment of particles in the bulk of the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> we explore a dynamical regime where the boundary processes of lattice extension and particle input compete with the bulk process of particle attachment and detachment . </S>",
    "<S> this competition leads to scale invariant density profile of particles when expressed in terms of the relative position in the growing lattice . </S>",
    "<S> it also leads to phase coexistence and shocks in the bulk of the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> we use a combination of mean field ( mf ) analysis and monte carlo simulations to characterize the density profile in growing lattice and construct a mf phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> this study will have possible implications for transport and patterning in growing fungal filament .    </S>",
    "<S> an intrinsic feature of the biological world is the process of growth . </S>",
    "<S> one fascinating aspect of growth process during embryonic development is the formation of patterns . </S>",
    "<S> positional information associated with pattern formation is initiated by concentration gradient of morphogens @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> experimental studies such as the one done with wild - type d. _ melanogaster _ embryos have indicated that the _ bicoid _ morphogen distribution scales linearly with the size of the embryo @xcite , which would imply that as a function of the relative position in the embryo , the morphogen distribution is invariant . in general such scaled patterning </S>",
    "<S> is seen to be robust against environmental variations and genetic background variations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a natural question that arises in this context is - what are the mechanisms by which such scale invariant patterning is achieved ? </S>",
    "<S> the answer to this question is an involved one , which requires careful consideration depending on the specific biological context . while we are not going to address that issue in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , it would serve as the broad motivation for focusing our attention on a simple one dimensional lattice model for growth which exhibits such scaled growth pattern . </S>",
    "<S> for such scaled growth pattern , the density profile remains invariant in the scaled position variable @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the position and @xmath2 the length of the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> this model that we would discuss , incorporates some of the ingredients involved in quasi one - dimensional biological growth process of individual fungi filament .    </S>",
    "<S> fungi are eukaryotes and can typically grow as cylindrical tubes ( hyphae ) , with the growth happening at the tip of fungi @xcite . the material required for growth is packaged as vesicles that are supplied to the growing tip by molecular motors . </S>",
    "<S> the molecular motors transport these materials using the microtubules tracks to the growing end of the hyphae . </S>",
    "<S> these vesicles bring fresh membrane , and regulators neccesary for growth . </S>",
    "<S> the growth process of fungal hyphae have a sense of persistence in one direction . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to linear growth of the filament , lateral branching of hypha also appears giving rise to a network termed as _ mycelium _ @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fungal mycelium exhibits patterning and it has also been observed that the spatial pattern associated with morphogenesis in fungi during spore germination requires the presence of microtubules @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we model the growing fungal filament as a one dimensional lattice which can grow at the one of the ends of the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the model that we study belongs to the class of driven lattice gas models and a generalization of the model of dynamic lattice first proposed and studied in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> driven lattice gas models have been used to model a number of biological processes , such as the motion of ribosomes in m - rna  @xcite , motor and vesicle transport  @xcite , transport across biomembranes  @xcite and growth of fungal hyphae @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> many of these models are based on the totally asymmetric exclusion process ( tasep ) , in which the particles jumps unidirectionally on the lattice with a single rate and interacts with other particle via hard - core repulsion . for tasep , the entire non - equilibrium phase diagram in terms of particle fluxes at the boundaries , has been worked out exactly@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> tasep has been generalized to incorporate a dynamically extending lattice , which is growing at one the ends of the lattice @xcite . for such dynamically extending tasep , the growth velocity at tip is proportional to the particle density at the tip and this minimal model has been proposed to describe the growth of fungal hyphae @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> number of other kinds of dynamic lattice gas models have studied in varied context such as a dynamic lattice coupled to a diffusive reservoir @xcite and a dynamic lattice which includes process of corrosion@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> here we consider the coupling of the lattice growth process with langmuir kinetics . </S>",
    "<S> for the case of growth of fungal hyphae , the fact that the transported cargo may detach ( and reattach ) to the microtubule filament makes it plausible scenario to explore . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we study the dynamic regime where these two processes compete ; the kinetic rates are such that fluxes of the particles at the boundaries are comparable to that fluxes in the bulk . for a static lattice , the competition beween particle fluxes at the boundaries with the process of particle exchange with the surrounding </S>",
    "<S> bath has been addressed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we study this competition in context of dynamically extending lattice , focussing on a regime where the site attachment and detachment rates scale inversely as the system size . </S>",
    "<S> we use mean field ( mf ) analysis to study the system and compare these results with those obtained by perfoming monte carlo simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the competition between the growth process and kinetics of attachment and detachment not only leads to the possibility of phase coexistence and shocks in the co - moving frame of the growing lattice , it also implies scale invariant density profile in the growing lattice . </S>",
    "<S> this dynamic regime exhibits qualitatively new scenario when compared to the situation when the growing lattice is coupled to a bulk reservoir where the total attachment and detachment rates scales extensively with the filament size @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we represent the growing filament at any instant of time to be a one - dimensional lattice of length l and lattice sites n with a lattice spacing @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> particles hop unidirectionally to the left on this lattice with the instantaneous configuration being described in terms of the occupation number of particles at each lattice site @xmath4 , which can assume values @xmath5 if the site @xmath4 is occupied or @xmath6 if the site is vacant . </S>",
    "<S> the lattice length and the number of lattice sites increase due the growth process which happens at the left end of the filament . </S>",
    "<S> the lattice growth happens when a particle moving unidirectionally towards the left on the lattice , reaches the filament end and creates a new lattice site with a rate @xmath7 so that the total lattice length increases by an amount @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the non - growing right end of the filament is supplied with particles which enters the rightmost site with a rate @xmath9 . in the bulk of the lattice </S>",
    "<S> two distinct processes can occur : particles can hop to the neighboring site on the left with rate @xmath10 , if the site is vacant ; particles can detach from the filament with rate @xmath11 or a new particle can attach to the filament lattice site with a rate @xmath12 provided the site is vacant . </S>",
    "<S> the various dynamical processes are summarized in fig.1 . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the situation , similar to @xcite , where the overall ( un)binding rates for the entire lattice is held fixed , so that the site ( un)binding rates vary inversely with the system size . since the lattice size continously increases , there are two frames to consider ; while one is the laboratory frame , the other is a frame attached to the growing tip . </S>",
    "<S> we choose the reference frame attached to the growing tip of the filament , with the leftmost site being labelled as @xmath10 and the rightmost being labelled as site @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> we write the evolution equation of the occupation number of particles in the aforementioned frame . </S>",
    "<S> any site @xmath4 measures the distance of that site from the growing tip . </S>",
    "<S> each lattice site can be occupied by at most one particle . whenever the lattice grows due to creation of a new site at the tip , all the site labels </S>",
    "<S> are updated @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution equation for the occupation numbers in the bulk at site @xmath4 is , @xmath15 the terms on the right hand side of the equation have their usual interpretation of gain and loss terms due to translation of the particles , the effect of the growing tip and the langmuir kinetics . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding current at site @xmath4 can be identified as , @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the occupation number of the particles at sites 1 and 2 in the comoving frame of the tip are respectively , @xmath17 at the right end of the filament the evolution equation reads ,    @xmath18    defining @xmath19 , we introduce mean field approximation which amounts to taking averages over ensembles and factorizing the two - point correlators , @xmath20 = @xmath21 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we now write the continuum evolution equation in terms of the rescaled variable x = @xmath22 , which measures the relative position of the particle in the growing lattice . </S>",
    "<S> we define the reduced rates , @xmath23 and @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> these rates have the interpretation of the total bulk attachment and detachment rates of particles for the entire growing lattice . in the thermodynamic limit of @xmath25 </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain the the continuum evolution equation as ,    @xmath26- \\gamma n_{1}\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{dx }   -\\omega_{e}\\rho + \\omega_{d}(1 -\\rho )   \\label{eq : mfbulk}\\ ] ]    where we have retained terms upto leading order in @xmath27 .    in the continuum description , the evolution equation of density at the non - growing end at @xmath28 satisfies ,    @xmath29 -\\rho(1)[1-\\rho(1 ) ] \\label{eq : rb}\\ ] ]    the evolution equation for particle densities at sites @xmath10 and @xmath30 are respectively ,    @xmath31    where @xmath32 and @xmath33 . in order to determine the steady state density at the boundary of the growing tip </S>",
    "<S> , we make the approximation , @xmath34    then using eq.([eq : bound1 ] ) and eq.([eq : bound2 ] ) we obtain , @xmath35    the approximation of eq.([eq : approx ] ) works reasonably well , when the bulk phase adjoining the tip of the growing tip is a high density phase . </S>",
    "<S> so for example if the bulk phase is a high density phase or even a mixed phase of high and low density , then this approximation can predict the steady state density profile at the growing tip boundary reasonably well , as seen by comparison with profiles obtained by monte carlo simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we shall elaborate more on the domain of validity of this approximation , when we discuss the possible phases and construct the phase diagram later .    </S>",
    "<S> having obtained the the expression for @xmath36 , the continuum steady state equation assumes the form ,    @xmath37    where , @xmath38 j has the interpretation of particle current in the bulk of the lattice in the frame of the moving tip .    integrating eq.([eq : ss1 ] ) , we obtain , @xmath39\\log\\left[\\frac { \\omega\\rho   -\\omega_{d}}{\\omega\\rho_{b }   - \\omega_{d } } \\right]= \\omega </S>",

    "<S> @xmath44 .    </S>",
    "<S> when the density profile satisfies the boundary condition at @xmath45 , then the boundary density is obtained by equating to the occupation number density at site @xmath30 to the boundary density , so that @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> this density profile corresponds to a high density ( hd ) phase . for the density profile which satisfies the boundary condition at the other end of the filament located at @xmath47 </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> this density profile corresponds to a low density ( ld ) phase . in general </S>",
    "<S> , the boundary conditions imposed at the two filament ends can not be satisfied simultaneously . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , at least two domains usually develop along the filament , giving rise to the possibility of shock profiles . </S>",
    "<S> the location of the shock is determined by equating the current @xmath49 for the ld and hd solution at the position of the shock . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] shows shock density profile obtained by monte carlo simulations for different system sizes . </S>",
    "<S> these profiles are compared with the mf prediction of eq.([eq : ss ] ) corresponding to the ld and hd mean field solution of density . as seen in fig.[fig2 ] , the entire density profile including the location of shocks overlaps for the different system size in the scaled variable @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this would imply that the growth process is such that the density profile remains invariant for different system sizes in the scaled variable @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we also observe that the mf predictions matches reasonably well with the monte carlo simulation results . in order to analyse the different dynamical growing phases that are possible for this system , we focus on a special regime where the kinetic rates satisfy the constraint , @xmath50 for this choice of constraint , the steady state equation for the bulk reduces to , @xmath51\\left[\\frac{d\\rho}{dx } + b\\right ] = 0   \\label{eq : mflinear}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 . + </S>",
    "<S> thus for this particular choice of constraint , the steady state mf density profiles either vary linearly with @xmath1 or are homogenous with respect to @xmath1 . as a result , there are three different profiles which may coexist along the filament . </S>",
    "<S> the different solutions correspond to a linearly decreasing high density ( hd ) solution which satisfies the boundary density at the growing tip @xmath53 , a linearly decreasing low density ( ld ) solution which satisfies the boundary condition at @xmath54 and a homogenous density solution ( u ) which is similar to a density profile determined by langmuir kinetics alone . </S>",
    "<S> the non - equilibrium phase diagram can be constructed once we determine the limits of coexistence of the phases . </S>",
    "<S> phase coexistence in bulk can occur when the densities in the linear phases ( ld or hd ) matches with the density of the homogenous solution ( u ) at @xmath55 , in the domain range @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is position of the domain wall separating the two phases . for ld phase to coexist with the hd phase , current of the ld phase must equal the particle current in the hd phase at domain wall position @xmath58 in the domain @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> phases on the either side of the domain wall would have a density profile corresponding to the particular phase on the growing lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the phase boundaries are determined by the condition of expulsion of one of the phases from the bulk , i.e ; by setting the location of the domain wall position to the filament boundaries . while the density changes continuously on moving across the phase boundary separating the u region with the hd(ld ) region , the density change is dicontinuous while moving from a ld region to a hd region .    in order to analytically determine the mf density profile and the phase boundaries , separating the different phase regions </S>",
    "<S> , we again use the approximation introduced in eq.([eq : approx ] ) , so that the expressions for @xmath59 and @xmath60 are determined by eq.([eq : rho1a ] ) and eq.([eq : rho2 ] ) , as before . </S>",
    "<S> this approximation scheme implicitly assumes that @xmath59 is determined by the boundary conditions at the growing end of the filament alone . </S>",
    "<S> this is valid when the bulk density adjoining @xmath61 is determined by the growth rate at growing top alone , and the rate of tip growth is the rate limiting process which controls the bulk density adjoining the region of the growing tip . </S>",
    "<S> however when entire bulk phase is a ld phase and the hd phase is totally expelled from the growing end of the filament , then this approximation will not hold good . </S>",
    "<S> as long as the high density phase is present in the bulk , this approximation is reasonable , as confirmed by monte carlo simulations and illustrated in fig.2 . </S>",

    "<S> _ phase coexistence line between the u and hd - u : _ this is determined by matching the density for the hd phase , with the density in u phase at @xmath61 . thus the equation of phase boundary is , @xmath83    thus we see that above this critical value of @xmath7 determined by eq.([eq : mmh ] ) , the high density phase is expelled from the bulk of the lattice . in such situation </S>",
    "<S> the only possibilities are that of homogenous @xmath84 phase , a pure @xmath85 phase and @xmath86 phase coexistence .    for a pure ld phase , </S>",
