    "typically , an open quantum system is a system interacting with an external environment which experimentalists can not control @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the dynamics of an open quantum system can be described in one of the following ways : local and non - local master equations for the density matrix @xcite , feynman s path integrals @xcite , stochastic schrdinger equations ( sse ) @xcite and quantum trajectories @xcite . in this review",
    "we give a description of the technique based on the sse , which can be useful for the description of markovian and non - markovian dynamics of open quantum systems .",
    "moreover , we shall illustrate the markovian and non - markovian theory by giving some simulations . in the non - markovian case we also use the stochastic simulations to check the validity of an analytic approximation for the mean state .",
    "the stochastic representation of quantum markovian processes already appeared in the fundamental work by davies @xcite and it was applied to the derivation of a photocounting formula . while the theory was originally formulated in terms of a stochastic process for the reduced density matrix , it was recognized by barchielli and belavkin @xcite , dalibard , castin and mlmer @xcite and by dum , zoller and ritsch @xcite that it can also be formulated as a stochastic process for the state vector in the reduced system hilbert space and that it leads to efficient numerical simulation algorithms . at the same time",
    ", there has been considerable interest in the unravelling of master equations for density operators into quantum trajectories which are the realizations of the underlying stochastic process @xcite .",
    "just as different ensembles of state vectors may be represented by one density operator , one master equation may be decomposed in many different ways into sses .",
    "the sse is a differential equation for a wave - function process @xmath0 which contains a stochastic term to describe the relaxation dynamics of an open quantum system .",
    "the link with the traditional master equation is given by the average property @xmath1 = \\eta(t)$ ] , where @xmath2 denotes the ensemble average over the realizations of process @xmath0 and @xmath3 is the statistical operator satisfying the master equation .",
    "to find the sse providing a given master equation by averaging is called _ unravelling _",
    "@xcite .",
    "also , in special situations , the sse can be interpreted in terms of quantum measurements . in these cases ,",
    "the solution @xmath0 is called a _ quantum trajectory _",

    "this interpretation is important for understanding quantum optics experiments such as direct photo - detection , spectral photo - detection , homodyning and heterodyning @xcite .    in the regime of the validity of the markov approximation ( no memory effects )",
    "@xcite it is known how to construct an appropriate unravelling in terms of a sse .",
    "it is always possible to derive a linear sse for a non - normalized vector @xmath4 , such that @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , the linear and nonlinear versions of the sse are related by a change of probability measure , and it is this link that allows for a measurement interpretation @xcite .",
    "also , these stochastic differential equations can be deduced from purely quantum evolution equations for the measured system coupled with a quantum environment , combined with a continuous monitoring of the environment itself @xcite .    in the non - markovian case @xcite , to find relevant sses describing both non - markovian quantum evolutions and continuous monitoring is a complex task .",
    "other than in the markovian case , no general theory has been developed .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to follow a general strategy .",
    "this strategy is first to generalize directly the markovian sse , second to show if it provides an unravelling of a corresponding master equation , and third to check if it has a measurement interpretation @xcite .",
    "to work at the hilbert space level guarantees automatically the complete positivity of the evolution of the statistical operator .",
    "it seems possible to adapt the markovian approach by replacing white noises with more general noises and by allowing for random coefficients in the equation .",
    "we will show how to introduce memory effects in the sse with the help of coloured noise .",
    "specifically , we will illustrate the approach by replacing the wiener process with the ornstein - uhlenbeck process .",
    "such approaches are efficient for simulating corresponding non - markovian evolutions .",
    "also , the non - markovian sse is formulated in a way that allows for an interpretation in terms of measurements in continuous time .",
    "the paper introduces the general theory of the sse as well as the corresponding simulation techniques and is structured as follows .",
    "section [ sec : sse ] describes the general theory of the sses in the markovian case .",
    "it presents the general mathematical framework of the linear and nonlinear sse .",
    "we consider a linear stochastic equation with `` multiplicative noise '' for the wave function @xmath4 in the purely diffusive case .",
    "then , we discuss how to get the physical probabilities and we derive the nonlinear sse for the conditional states @xmath0 . in section [ sec : simm ] we describe the simulation techniques for sses and we show the simulations for two markovian processes , the damped harmonic oscillator and a two - level atom with homodyne photodetection .",
    "section [ sec : memory ] is devoted to the introduction of coloured noise in the sses ; we limit the presentation of this part of the theory to a restricted , but significant , class of sses with memory .",
    "the simulation of such non - markovian processes is also proposed and applied as a test of other approximation techniques . in section [ sec : concl ] we briefly summarize the main results and indicate some directions of future work .",
    "basic concepts from the theory of stochastic processes are summarized in the appendix [ appen ] .",
    "in this paper we will show the approach to the theory of open quantum systems based on stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) , with particular emphases on continuous measurements .",
    "in this theory there are four kinds of sdes : the linear stochastic schrdinger equation ( lsse ) , a linear sde for non - normalized vectors in the hilbert space of the system , the sse , a nonlinear sde for normalized vectors in the hilbert space , the linear stochastic master equation ( * ? ? ?",

    "the output is not discrete , but it is a whole trajectory of some observed quantity ; this brings into play the stochastic processes . apart from this complication , the lsse is an evolution equation for the analog of the non - normalized vectors @xmath21 , while the sse is the evolution equation for the analog of the post - measurement states @xmath20 .",
    "note that the map @xmath22 is linear , while the map @xmath23 is non - linear due to the normalization ; the same difference will characterize the passage from the lsse to the sse .",
