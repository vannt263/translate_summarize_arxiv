    "it is generally believed that a description of the gravity consistent with quantum theory ( quantum gravity ) should imply properties of the space  time much different from the conventional ones , when the latter is being observed at the so  called _",
    "planck scale_. such a planck scale is obtained as a combination of fundamental constants and corresponds to a characteristic length @xmath0 m and time interval @xmath1 s given by :    @xmath2    space and time , when observed at such scales , are expected to exhibit a grainy , fuzzy or a foam - like structure , as depicted by several authors ( see for instance rovelli 1998 , garay 1998 , kempf 1999 ) . the operational definition of measurement of a length or of a time ",
    "interval should be affected by such property of space  time ( wigner , 1957 ; salecker & wigner .",
    "1958 ; adler & santiago , 1999 ) and one can conceive several _ gedanken _ experiments that should be affected by the so  called planck scale phenomenology ( hereafter psp , see amelino ",
    "camelia , 2001a ) .    in spite of the extremely small size of @xmath3 ,",
    "recently several authors pointed out that the _ systematic accumulation _ of such effect during the long journey of a photon propagating through a space  time affected by psp could lead to observable consequences .",
    "several possible measurements has been proposed so far ( amelino  camelia et al .",
    ", 1997 , 1998 ; ellis , mavromatos & nanopoulos , 2000 ; ng & van dam , 1999 ) and eventually later criticized ( adler et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "most recently lieu & hillman , 2002 ( hereafter lh02 ) suggested that differential phase measurements of light propagated over a long distance , as implicitly made by interferometry of an extragalactic source , can place much tighter constraints on psp .",
    "they derived the effect on the random phase variation as depending upon the ratio of the photon wavelength @xmath4 and the planck length @xmath3 .",
    "it is important to point out that the effects described by lh02 refers to a model of psp leading to random variations of the light phase , while others exhibit a definite modification of radiation behavior for a given wavelength ( jacobson , liberati & mattingly , 2002 ; amelino  camelia 2002 ) .",
    "in other words any spacetime structure model that yields a definite modification at a given wavelength is unconstrained by the random phase approach .",
    "furthermore , we are aware that lh02 has been the subject of even more recent criticism ( ng , van dam & christiansen , 2003 ) essentially based upon the idea that such random perturbation of space ",
    "time should add incoherently along the propagation path , leading to a square - root dependency upon the distance between the source and the observer .",
    "we just here note that such assumption is at the basis of other psps ( amelino camelia , 1994 ) already ruled out by experimental verifications ( ng & van dam , 1999 ) and that other theories does not incorporate such dependencies too ( karolyhazy , 1966 ; ng & van dam , 1994 ) .    in this letter",
    "we argue that the use of diffraction , as an interferometry effect by a telescope dish , can put stringent limits on the psp with random phase variations .",
    "following lh02 we assume that the error in the phase of a wavefront is just a different way of expressing the impossibility of measuring , by means of light at wavelength @xmath4 , a distance @xmath5 with a precision @xmath6 such that :    @xmath7    where the parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 characterize the theory being tested .",
    "for instance @xmath10 corresponds to the random ",
    "walk approach ( amelino  camelia , 2000 ) while @xmath11 corresponds to the holography principle ( wheeler , 1982 ; hawking , 1975 ) and @xmath12 is the natural choice in a linearized theory .",
    "the coefficient @xmath8 can be reasonably expected to be of the order of the unity but , according to amelino ",
    "camelia ( 2001b ) it can be _ a few orders of magnitude _ below unity .",
    "this gives an idea of the region of the parameter space described by @xmath8 and @xmath9 where a meaningful search should be done .",
    "let us assume , in fact , that the measurement of _ any _ distance between a light source and a telescope of diameter @xmath13 is affected by the psp described above , and translates into independent modification of the wavefront phase as determined from two distinct positions ( this assumption , in the lh02 framework , corresponds to the , obviously verified , requirement of @xmath14 ) .",
    "let us consider the distances @xmath15 and @xmath16 as measured from a point source placed at a distance @xmath17 from the two sides of a telescope of aperture @xmath13 , see fig.1 .",
    "any intrinsic variation @xmath6 in the wavefront along the two lines of sight will translate into an apparent angular shift @xmath18 given by :    @xmath19    where we did not co - add the ( independent ) uncertainties over the possible set of sightliness starting from any point of the telescope pupil ( for instance , considering only @xmath15 and @xmath16 a @xmath20 factor should be inserted into eq.3 ) as this would not change the order of magnitude of the result .",
    "it is important to emphasize that this result does not presume our knowledge of either @xmath15 or @xmath16 with the accuracy stated in eq.(2 ) .",
    "actually the distance of any astronomical object is known with a much poorer accuracy than that required to test eq.(2 ) .",
    "the key point here is the _ independence _ of the accuracies on the measurements .",
    "specifically , the difference in the optical paths joining various points of the telescope pupil and the ( unresolved ) source is randomly modified by psp .",
    "if the psp effects of eq . ( 2 ) are present , will this lead to a deterioration of any interference pattern ( e.g. the airy rings of a filled aperture ) seen at the diffraction limit ? such a consequence is inevitable - to avoid it one must invoke the highly unlikely scenario of _ correlated _ fluctuations in the optical paths over all points along the entire span of the light footprint , which in general has a size @xmath21 ( excepting only an initial segment of paths , @xmath22 in length , which for the purpose of this work is an irrelevantly short ( i.e. @xmath23 ) segment ) .",
    "thus it is reasonable to deduce that psp leads to an apparent angular broadening of a light source placed at a distance @xmath5 , as seen from a telescope of diameter @xmath13 , given by :    @xmath24    we compare such an angular broadening with the diffraction limit imposed by the telescope aperture by introducing a ratio @xmath25 defined as :    @xmath26    the meaning of @xmath25 is that it directly influences fringe visibility in the case of an interferometer , or the strehl ratio @xmath27 of deterioration in point spread function in the case of a telescope .",
    "this is because one can write , following sandler et al .",
    "1994 and assuming that the broadening is equivalent to a blurring effect due to ( e.g. ) atmospheric disturbance , the following equation for @xmath27 :    @xmath28    it is reasonable to adopt @xmath29 as rough criterion for any experimental setup of this kind to secure a reliable test of psp effects . at @xmath30 m , a representative wavelength for diffraction limited optical telescopes ( including the @xmath31 m aperture of the hst and @xmath32 m class ground  based telescopes equipped with adaptive optics facilities ) , this criterion requires the observation of sources at a minimum distance @xmath33 m @xmath34 mpc , as already noted in lh02 , to detect or to rule out the case for @xmath12 , @xmath35 .",
    "a celestial object that appears extended can either be because it is genuinely so , or psp causes a blurring of the image in the manner described above . to avoid confusion between the two possibilities ,",
    "the best target choice is a supernovae ( sne ) .",
    "this is because for a distant sne , its angular size must remain considerably smaller than the telescope diffraction limit even if one assumes that the sne shell has been expanding steadily at the speed of light since the initial explosion . evidently ,",
    "then , our purpose of scrutinizing psp will be fulfilled by an investigation of an hst archival image of sn1994d , located at @xmath36mpc ( patat et al . , 1996 ) .",
    "by comparing the hst  collected frame of sn1994d with that of a foreground galactic star in the same field ( see fig.2 ) we see that both objects exhibit no deterioration of their airy interference patterns .",
    "this constrains the strehl deterioration parameter to @xmath37 ( else the first airy rings will become invisible ) , and hence ( by eq .",
    "6 ) places a lower limit for @xmath25 at @xmath38 .",
    "a separate investigation concerns the hubble deep field high@xmath39 images .",
    "spectroscopic follow ",
    "ups have shown that objects as distant as @xmath40 , corresponding to @xmath41gpc are as small as 0.12arcsec ( spinrad et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "the distance adopted here is the comoving radial distance , as it is the summation over the journey of the photon of the length experienced by a comoving observer , where we assume the psp exhibits in the same way .",
    "the exact value for @xmath5 depends on the cosmological model used ; here we have chosen @xmath42km / s / mpc and @xmath43 as given in krauss ( 2002 ) ,    since @xmath44 is the ratio of this observed size to the diffraction limit capability of a @xmath31 m telescope at the relevant wavelength of @xmath45 nm , one can clinch psp even further than before .",
    "we note in passing that , in reality , such a ratio for @xmath25 understates the case against psp , because while propagating from the source to us a photon initially had shorter wavelength , so that the quantity @xmath6 of eq.(2 ) , hence @xmath18 of eq .",
    "( 3 ) , was larger in the past .",
    "in fig . 3 implications of the two observations being analyzed thus far are plotted in @xmath8@xmath9 space .",
    "we can see that a linear , first  order psp characterized by @xmath46 is consistently excluded , as are the other cited phenomenologies with smaller @xmath9 , for all reasonable values of @xmath8 .",
    "in particular , when @xmath47 , the upper limit on the angular size of high@xmath39 objects requires that @xmath48 .",
    "the two benchmarks presented in the previous section were established with the most powerful instruments currently available ( hst for measurement of the angular size and keck for determination of the cosmological distance ) .",
    "it should be realized that , in general , the existence of psp with @xmath49 would render the universe unobservable at any appreciable redshift , due to the significant blurring of the images of point sources .",
    "this may be regarded as a form of olber s paradox . in the case of the far universe ,",
    "where observations require special technique , additional benchmarks could be envisaged .",
    "quantitatively , the limits given above for the exclusion of first order psp understate the case , because ( a ) the errors were estimated conservatively - they would have assumed larger values had we propagated them at every step ; ( b ) the wavelength of radiation from a distant source is shorter towards the source , meaning that our upper limit on @xmath8 should in reality be even smaller .",
    "thus , in the same context as that of lh02 , the possibility of @xmath12 may be ruled out with confidence .",
    "our conclusions may be compared and contrasted with other recent works , notably those of jacobson , liberati & mattingly ( 2002 ) and amelino  camelia ( 2002 ) .",
    "the former used x - ray observations of the crab nebula to argue against psp , its validity depends on the assumptions made about the physical processes in the crab .",
    "the latter , however , proposed the _ existence _ of psp effects as the reason why gamma - rays from a distant quasar survive their journey through the intergalactic medium to reach us .",
    "we note here also , that alternative interpretations are entirely possible .    in the framework of the assumptions made in lh02 ,",
    "psp effects are excluded by the observations described in this letter .",
    "perhaps there exist some _",
    "ad hoc _ explanations as to why first order psp can not be manifested as perturbation of a light pencil . as regards",
    "whether the present findings imply that the notion of structural space time at the planck scales ( a sort of _ aether _ embedded in the continuum where familiar physics holds ) is untenable , or whether a subtle mechanism is at play to render such structures evasive , these questions are outside the scope of our letter .",
    "thanks are due for the useful hints and discussions to richard lieu and lauro moscardini .",
    "we also thank the unknown referee for his helpful comments .",
