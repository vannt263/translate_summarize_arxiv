    "in recent years there has been a continuous interest in the investigation of semileptonic decays of @xmath5 meson into excited charmed mesons .",
    "this interest arises from several reasons .",
    "the current experimental data show that the exclusive @xmath5 transitions to the ground state @xmath6-wave @xmath7 and @xmath8 mesons make up only approximately 60% of the inclusive semileptonic decay rate , thus a sizeable part of semileptonic @xmath5 decays should go to excited @xmath7 meson states . indeed , these decays have been observed and more experimental data are collected with an increasing accuracy @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the semileptonic @xmath5 decays into excited charmed meson states can provide an additional source of information for determining the ckm matrix element @xmath9 as well as exploring the internal dynamics of systems containing heavy - light quarks .",
    "the heavy quark symmetry @xcite has important consequences on the spectroscopy and weak decay matrix elements of mesons containing a single heavy quark @xmath10 . in the infinite mass limit ,",
    "the spin and parity of the heavy quark and that of the light degrees of freedom are separately conserved .",
    "this allows that the hadronic states can be classified in degenerate doublets by the total angular momentum @xmath11 and the angular momentum of the light degrees of freedom @xmath12 . in the case of @xmath13 mesons , coupling @xmath12 with the spin of heavy quark @xmath14 yields a doublet with total spin @xmath15",
    "the ground state mesons with @xmath16 are the doublet ( @xmath7,@xmath8 ) for @xmath17 and ( @xmath5,@xmath18 ) for @xmath19 .",
    "the excited heavy mesons with @xmath20 and @xmath21 can be classified in two doublets of spin symmetry ( @xmath22,@xmath23 ) and ( @xmath23,@xmath24 ) , which are identified as ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) and ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) for charmed mesons , respectively .",
    "the other important application of heavy quark symmetries has been the study of semileptonic transitions between two heavy hadrons .",
    "the hadronic matrix elements of weak currents between members of the doublets identified by @xmath12 and @xmath29 can be expressed in terms of universal form factors which are functions of the dot - product , @xmath30 , of the initial and final hadron four - velocities .",
    "a well - known result is that the semileptonic @xmath5 decays to ground state @xmath31 mesons , in the @xmath32 limit , can be described in terms of a single universal function , the isgur - wise function @xmath33 . while the decays to @xmath34-wave excited @xmath7 mesons with @xmath20 and @xmath21 require two independent functions , @xmath35 and @xmath36 @xcite , respectively , in the limit @xmath32 .",
    "there are @xmath37 corrections to the weak matrix elements parameterized by form factors at the @xmath32 limit .",
    "the @xmath38 corrections to the leading term can be analyzed in a systematic way in heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) in terms of a reduced number of universal parameters .",
    "the @xmath39 corrections may play an important role for @xmath5-decay modes into excited charmed states since the corresponding transition matrix elements in the infinite mass limit vanish at zero recoil point because of heavy quark spin symmetry , while @xmath39 corrections to these decay matrix elements can give nonzero contributions at zero recoil @xcite .",
    "the kinematically allowed range for these decays mostly occurs near the zero recoil point , thus the magnitude of @xmath39 corrections might be comparable with the leading order result .    the universal functions must be estimated in some nonperturbative approaches .",
    "a viable approach is the qcd sum rules @xcite formulated in the framework of hqet @xcite .",
    "this method allows us to relate hadronic observables to qcd parameters _ via _ the operator product expansion ( ope ) of the correlator .",
    "a fruitful application of qcd sum rules has been the determination of the isgur - wise functions parameterizing the @xmath40 semileptonic transitions up to the @xmath37 corrections@xcite .",
    "the qcd sum rule analysis for the semileptonic @xmath5 decays to excited @xmath7 mesons involves the determination of the universal form factors . at leading order in the @xmath2 expansion , the two independent universal form factors @xmath35 and @xmath36 , that parameterize transitions @xmath41 ( @xmath42 being the generic @xmath43 charmed state ) , have been calculated with qcd sum rules@xcite .",
    "moreover , perturbative corrections to @xmath44 have been included in the qcd sum rule for @xmath35 in @xcite .",
    "the other approaches include various versions of the constituent quark model @xcite and relativistic bethe - salpeter equations @xcite .",
    "the analysis of @xmath38 corrections is an important issue for the semileptonic @xmath5 decays to excited @xmath7 mesons .",
    "such corrections have been investigated in terms of meson mass splittings in ref .",
    "@xcite and by employing the relativistic quark model in ref .",
    "the corrections have also been included by a variant approach in hqeft in ref .",
    "@xcite . at the order @xmath2 , the corrections for matrix elements of @xmath41 include contributions from higher - dimensional operators in the effective currents and in the effective lagrangian . for the semileptonic transitions",
    "@xmath45 and @xmath46 , the former give rise to two independent universal functions , denoted by @xmath47 and @xmath48@xcite . in the framework of qcd sum rules , these two independent form factors have been investigated in our previous work in @xcite . here",
