    "<S> all these nonlinear processes depend on the creation of coherent superpositions of the ground states with accompanying loss of absorption , and such mechanisms were described in @xcite .  </S>",
    "<S> thorough reviews of eit and its properties can be found in @xcite and @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> recent investigations of nonlinear optics at the few or single photon levels have identified four state systems where the probe field simultaneously couples two transitions in the n configuration .  </S>",

    "<S> et al_. @xcite suggested an extension where the more usual n configuration was extended to a system with an arbitrary ( even ) number of states where all the states are resonantly coupled except on the final transition where detuning is present .  </S>",
    "<S> this scheme shows enhanced nonlinearities of not only @xmath2 but also higher order susceptibilities .  </S>",
    "<S> one problem with this scheme and the standard n scheme is to do with the need to balance the required nonlinearity and decoherence in the system .  to enhance the nonlinearity present in the systems it is important for the detuning of the final probe field to be minimized , however decreasing the detuning increases the amount of the final excited state which is mixed into the coherent superposition state , resulting in an increase in decoherence and optical losses .  </S>",
    "<S> this problem is to some extent circumvented by the absorptive switch of harris and yamomoto @xcite by exploiting such losses , and in photon blockade by using the cavity nonlinearity to prevent absorption of the final photon .  </S>",
    "<S> still the increase in decoherence proves to be a difficulty in experimental precursors to these processes and causes problems in travelling wave configurations .    </S>",
    "<S> an alternative multistate configuration for investigating eit enhanced nonlinearities is the tripod configuration , studied recently by paspalakis and knight @xcite and earlier considered by morris and shore @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this system has many of the advantages of the n system , but by maintaining superposition states of the three ground states also avoids the excess decoherence of the n system . </S>",
