    "an important recent result in the field of galaxy evolution is the build - up of the red sequence between @xmath5 and the present .",
    "the red sequence luminosity function determined by the combo-17 survey @xcite shows an accumulation of massive red galaxies since @xmath5 .",
    "this result was confirmed by @xcite using combined data from combo-17 and the deep2 redshift survey .",
    "@xcite contrasted the evolving luminosity function of red galaxies with the luminosity function of massive blue galaxies , which remains roughly constant over the same epoch . with so much transition in the relatively recent past , there should be visible evidence of recent red - galaxy creation in the local universe ; that is , nearby galaxy samples might contain galaxies that are currently evolving onto the red sequence , as well as recent red sequence arrivals .",
    "stellar population models predict that once a galaxy has ceased to form stars it will move to the red sequence rapidly . a galaxy whose star formation is quenched suddenly after a history of continuous constant star formation will arrive on the red sequence within @xmath6 myr , while a galaxy that experiences a substantial burst of star formation before quenching will take only @xmath7 gyr to become red @xcite",
    ". the red sequence may therefore include galaxies which contain a fractional population of stars with young ages . under the possibly more reasonable assumption of star formation that declines with time",
    ", the fraction of young stars will be smaller , will contribute less to the total galaxy light , and presumably the galaxy will move to the red sequence more rapidly .",
    "recently , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have used near - ultraviolet ( nuv ) photometry from the galex medium imaging survey in conjunction with sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) optical photometry to examine the colors of early - type galaxies .",
    "they show that morphologically selected early - type galaxies have uniformly red optical colors but exhibit a wide range of nuv - optical colors . according to their analysis ,",
    "the observed blue nuv - optical colors in some early - type galaxies are indicative of low levels of residual star formation ; they use @xcite stellar population models to demonstrate that blue _",
    "nuv_-optical colors are sensitive to very low levels of recent star formation and determine that at least 30% of red sequence galaxies have 13% of their mass in young ( age @xmath8 gyr ) stars , with typical ages for the young component of 300500 myr .",
    "although the nuv - optical colors of these morphologically selected galaxies show signs of recent star formation , the galaxies in their sample lack optical emission lines , almost without exception .",
    "@xcite show that their morphological selection criterion removes virtually all galaxies with emission lines characteristic of hii regions .",
    "in addition , they exclude all galaxies with emission lines characteristic of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and low ionization nuclear emission regions ( liners ) , using the criterion established by @xcite .",
    "this is to remove from the sample galaxies that might have substantial ultraviolet ( uv ) light generated by a source other than the stars .",
    "however , by excluding all galaxies with agn - like emission lines , they may have removed many red sequence galaxies from their sample which are not forming stars .",
    "these galaxies could include many of the most recent arrivals on the red sequence .",
    "@xcite show that the host galaxies of luminous ( [ oiii]@xmath9 emission line luminosities in excess of @xmath10 ) agn appear to be young or post - starburst systems , while those of low - luminosity active nuclei ( a category dominated by liners in their sample ) have morphologies and stellar populations that are comparable to those of early - type galaxies with no emission .",
    "recently , @xcite have shown that up to 30% of red sequence galaxies in the sdss have emission lines , with line ratios characteristic of liners .",
    "another @xmath11% of the red sequence consists of `` quiescent '' galaxies with no detectable emission , while the remaining @xmath12% are divided among seyferts , dusty star - forming galaxies , and transition objects , which likely contain both seyfert and hii region emission @xcite .",
    "a significant fraction of the red sequence population therefore consists of galaxies with optical line emission , although these galaxies are not necessarily forming stars .",
    "these galaxies are often systematically excluded from stellar population analysis of red sequence or early - type galaxies , even though they are a large class of objects and may harbor clues to the evolution of galaxies onto the red sequence .",
    "this paper presents a stellar population analysis of red sequence galaxies , including both quiescent galaxies with no emission and those with liner - like emission .",
    "the fact that galaxies with liner - like emission lines make up 30% of the red sequence , in addition to having morphologies and stellar populations that appear to be consistent with the larger population of early - type galaxies generally , justifies a stellar population analysis performed in parallel with quiescent red sequence galaxies .",
    "also , if liners are genuinely active nuclei and if their host galaxies form the low luminosity end of the agn host galaxy sequence described in @xcite , these galaxies with liner - like emission may be candidates for `` post post - starburst '' systems that have recently stopped forming stars and moved onto the red sequence .",
    "signs of such recent quenching could then be detected through a careful differential stellar population analysis of liners versus non - liners .",
    "there is still no consensus on the physical mechanism that powers liner emission .",
    "possibilities include photoionization by a central agn accretion disk as in higher ionization seyferts ( @xcite , @xcite ) , excitation through shocks ( as in the models of @xcite ) , accretion of warm gas in cooling flows ( e.g. @xcite ) , or photoionization by post asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars in either old @xcite or young @xcite stellar populations .",
    "this topic is covered by the @xcite review , which includes a nice summary of these mechanisms .",
    "there are clearly liners whose emission is strongly dominated by low luminosity cental agn , identified by either a central non - stellar source ( an x - ray or uv point source , or a compact radio core ) or by a signature of agn accretion ( broad line emission or even double - peaked broad h@xmath13 emission ) .",
    "examples of each of these are referenced in @xcite .",
    "however , there is also substantial evidence for ionized gas in early type galaxies that extends _ multiple kiloparsecs _ from the galaxy center , as shown in narrow - band imaging of early - type galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) and more recently in the sauron integral field unit spectroscopy of elliptical and lenticular galaxies @xcite .",
    "these studies imply that a large fraction of luminous elliptical galaxies contain _ distributed _ ionized gas with optical emission line ratios that are characteristic of liners",
    ". we must be careful with terminology , since the original definition of the term liner @xcite required that the emission be nuclear ( `` low ionization _ nuclear _ emission - line region '' ) .",
    "these galaxies are therefore not nuclear liners , but they do exhibit emission with liner - like ratios",
    ". we shall therefore refer to them as `` liner - like '' galaxies , without any assumption about the spatial distribution of the ionized gas within the galaxy or the ionization mechanism .",
    "from sdss data alone , whose spectral fibers cover a substantial portion of the galaxy , it is not possible to decide whether any given galaxy is a classic agn liner , an extended liner - like galaxy , or some combination of the two .    the fact that liner - like emission is common in red sequence galaxies prompts many questions :",
    "is it an evolutionary phase that all early - type galaxies pass through ?",
    "do galaxies pass through this stage more than once ? perhaps many times ?",
    "is it a cyclical process ? is the gas external in origin , as might be suggested by the kinematic decoupling of gas and stars seen by @xcite and @xcite , or is it produced by mass - loss from stars within the galaxy ?",
    "what is the relation , if any , between the central agn liner emission and the more extended liner - like emission ? in this paper , we seek to address some of these questions by examining the stellar populations of the host galaxies to determine whether or not the existence of liner - like emission in a red sequence galaxy is related to its star formation history .    past stellar population analysis of",
    "early - type or red sequence galaxies has tended to either exclude all galaxies with emission ( e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) or to include galaxies with weak liner - like emission in the main sample . in the latter case , authors have made a correction for balmer line emission infill using an empirical correction based on the strength of the [ oiii]@xmath9 ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) or [ oii]@xmath14 ( e.g. , @xcite ) emission lines , or else restrict themselves to using higher - order balmer lines such as h@xmath15 and h@xmath16 , where contamination from emission is less .",
    "in this work , we analyze galaxies with and without liner - like emission in parallel , in order to contrast their stellar population properties .",
    "liner - like nebulae produce only modest quantities of balmer emission , and that emission is well - characterized ( due to the selection process described in  [ infill_correction ] ) .",
    "this allows us to make accurate balmer infill corrections for multiple balmer lines and to compare results . in order to obtain very high signal to noise ( @xmath3 ) spectra for the stellar population analysis",
    ", we stack several hundred similar galaxies to produce highly accurate determinations of the mean stellar population properties of the galaxies that go into each composite .",
    "we use the new single stellar population ( ssp ) models of @xcite , which allow the determination of not only mean ages and total metallicities , but of several individual elemental abundances as well ; iron , magnesium , carbon , nitrogen , and calcium are all separately determined .",

    "this paper presents an analysis of red sequence galaxy spectra from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , a massive imaging and spectroscopic survey conducted at the apache point observatory with a dedicated 2.5 m telescope .",
    "the sdss has imaged more than one quarter of the sky in five filter bands : _ u , g , r , i , _ and _ z _ ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the survey has also obtained spectroscopic observations of over one million galaxies and quasars using a purpose - built dual fiber spectrograph , with resolution @xmath17 , wavelength coverage @xmath18 38009200 , and fiber diameter @xmath19 .",
    "the data presented in this paper are taken as part of the sdss main galaxy sample , which includes over 500,000 galaxies with redshifts @xmath20 .",
    "the main galaxy sample is selected to include galaxies brighter than @xmath21 .",
    "the following imaging and spectroscopic parameters for each galaxy were taken from the nyu value added catalog ( @xcite , @xcite ) , data release 4 ( dr4 ) : redshift @xmath22 , velocity dispersion @xmath23 as measured in the sdss fiber spectrum , @xmath24 fluxes measured in the sdss flux units `` maggies '' ( see @xcite ) , and median @xmath3 per  for each spectrum .",
    "the @xmath24 fluxes were converted to absolute magnitudes assuming standard @xmath25cdm cosmology ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) , with a hubble constant of @xmath28 km s@xmath29 mpc@xmath29 .",
    "the magnitudes were then k - corrected to @xmath30 using mike blanton s _ kcorrect _ code , v. 3_2 @xcite .",
    "we chose to k - correct to @xmath30 both to enable easy comparison with colors and magnitudes for sdss galaxies in @xcite and because we limited our galaxy sample to galaxies with @xmath1 ( see  [ select ] ) ; the k - correction to @xmath30 is small and therefore any errors due to uncertainty in the k - correction are minimized . throughout this paper ,",
    "all magnitudes and colors are quoted at @xmath30 , unless otherwise noted .",
    "these values were supplemented with the following measurements from the sdss dr4 catalog archive server : the best - fit devaucouleurs radius ( @xmath31 ) and axis ratio ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "our analysis also uses emission line equivalent widths ( ews ) for h@xmath13 , h@xmath33 , [ oii]@xmath343727 , [ oiii]@xmath345007 , [ oi]@xmath346300 , and [ nii]@xmath346583 measured in sdss dr4 galaxies by @xcite , with the zeropoint corrections defined in their table b3 . before making their emission line measurements , yan et al .",

    "the sample is chosen to match the selection criteria of the @xcite magnitude limited sample ; objects are from the sdss main galaxy sample and are spectroscopically confirmed to be galaxies .",
    "we then limit the sample to a narrow range in redshift , @xmath35 , making this magnitude - limited sample roughly volume - limited and minimizing the impact of evolution on this analysis .",
    "the @xmath36 sdss spectral fiber radius corresponds to 1.72.3 kpc in this redshift range .",
    "the aim of this work is to study red sequence galaxies with no active star formation .",
    "we use two selection criteria to select galaxies which are not currently forming stars : a color cut ( described below ) and the emission line properties of the galaxies .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the distribution of [ oii ] to h@xmath13 emission line ew ratios is bimodal such that some emission line galaxies have strong h@xmath13 emission but relatively weak [ oii ] emission while others have strong [ oii ] and weak h@xmath13 .",
    "this is best seen in a plot of log ew(h@xmath13 ) vs. log ew([oii ] ) , as in figure [ sample_cuts]a ( see also @xcite , figure 2 ) .",
    "they showed that the left peak with high ew([oii ] ) and low ew(h@xmath13 ) ( they call these `` high-[oii]/h@xmath13 '' galaxies ) is dominated by red sequence galaxies , whereas the right peak with larger ew(h@xmath13 ) ( `` low-[oii]/h@xmath13 '' galaxies ) is dominated by blue galaxies .",
    "this led them to explore the possibility that the high-[oii]/h@xmath13 galaxies are star - forming systems while the low-[oii]/h@xmath13 galaxies contain emission that is not powered by star formation .",
    "they confirm this hypothesis through the use of line ratio classification diagrams first proposed by @xcite and commonly known as `` bpt diagrams '' .",

    "the latter format does not highlight the bimodality as clearly but is a more natural way to examine the cut used to define the high-[oii]/h@xmath13 sample .    to confirm that the high-[oii]/h@xmath13 objects are not star forming galaxies , figure [ bpt ] shows bpt diagrams of emission line galaxies in the redshift range @xmath1 .",

    "panel ( b ) contains fewer objects than ( a ) because [ oi]@xmath346300 is a weak line and undetected in 2/3 of the high-[oii]/h@xmath13 and 1/2 of all other galaxies shown in ( a ) . the solid lines in each panel show the standard classification scheme dividing seyferts , liners , and star forming galaxies .",
    "the dotted lines show the @xcite division between star forming galaxies and active nuclei ; the dashed line in ( a ) shows the division used by @xcite .",
    "the dash - dot line in ( b ) shows the @xcite division between liners and transition objects ( tos ) .",
    "based on the @xcite division between star forming galaxies and active nuclei , the standard division between liners and seyferts , and the @xcite division between liners and tos , the red sequence high-[oii]/h@xmath13 galaxies consist of 88.4% liners , 8.6% tos , 1.9% seyferts , and 1.1% star forming galaxies .",
    "most of the high-[oii]/h@xmath13 objects classified as tos lie very near the division between liners and tos , well within the typical errors , and are not convincingly a separate class of objects .",

    ". we shall hereafter refer to these as `` quiescent '' and `` liner - like '' galaxies respectively .",

    "while the colors of the liner - like and quiescent galaxies are similar , the luminosity distribution is clearly different .",
    "this is partially a selection effect ; the liner - like galaxies are required to have both [ oii ] and h@xmath13 detected at the @xmath42 level , thus fainter galaxies with lower @xmath3 spectra are less likely to meet the selection criteria . taking this effect into account , there still appears to be a decline in the fraction of red sequence liner - like galaxies at faint magnitudes .",

    "careful study of their figure 3 reveals that at least 85% of the objects that they classify as liners fall into their low - luminosity agn sample , while only @xmath44% of their seyferts fall into this sample .",
    "comparisons to the results of @xcite are therefore most appropriate between our sample and their `` low - luminosity agn '' sample .",
    "however , they apply no color criterion to their selection of agn hosts . of the galaxies in our figure [ bpt ] which meet the @xcite definition of agn , 55% are bluer than our red sequence cut - off and",
    "37% meet the more conservative color criterion for blue galaxies in @xcite .",
    "the @xcite sample clearly includes many more young ( and possibly actively star forming ) galaxies than our sample .",
    "their analysis of other properties of the host galaxies suggest that the hosts of strong agn are young galaxies but that the hosts of their low - luminosity agn sample are similar to early - type galaxies , so many or most of these blue galaxies may be in their high - luminosity agn sample . however , their low - luminosity agn sample is still likely to contain a significant fraction of galaxies bluer than any present in our analysis .",
    "our analysis uses the strength of the stellar h@xmath33 , h@xmath15 , and h@xmath16 absorption features , in conjunction with metal lines , to measure ssp ages for the galaxies in our sample . in the liner - like galaxies ,",
    "stellar balmer line absorption will be partially or completely filled in by emission from the ionized gas within the galaxy .",
    "this infill severely impacts stellar population analysis , and a correction must be made .",
    "if we use the h@xmath13 and h@xmath33 emission line strengths measured by @xcite to make an emission infill correction , we merely recover the balmer absorption line strengths of their subtracted absorption line spectral template , and further stellar population modeling will be meaningless .",

    "@xcite use @xmath46h@xmath33 = 0.7 ew([oiii ] ) which , assuming the continuum level is similar at h@xmath33 and [ oiii ] , is a good match to the observed [ oiii]/h@xmath33 ratios for liners shown in figure [ bpt ] .",
    "however , [ oiii]@xmath45 is weaker in liners than [ oii]@xmath47 due to their lower ionization . for the sdss spectra used here , with typical @xmath48 @xmath29 , measurements of [ oiii ] are less reliable than those of [ oii ] . in the liner - like galaxy sample , fewer than one third of all galaxies",

    "can provide an estimate of h@xmath13 emission which is less dependent upon the balmer line strengths of the stellar template fit used to measure emission lines in @xcite .",
    "having estimated the h@xmath13 ew from [ oii ] , we can use a theoretically predicted balmer decrement to derive the expected emission line strengths of h@xmath33 , h@xmath15 , and h@xmath16 .",
    "the existence of a tight roughly linear scaling relation between ew([oii ] ) and ew(h@xmath13 ) suggests that both emission lines are produced by the same mechanism .",
    "the classification of quiescent vs. liner - like galaxies was based in part on a @xmath3 criterion that both emission lines be detected at a 2@xmath2 confidence level .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that galaxies exist with very faint emission that is undetected above the stellar continuum in the @xmath50 @xmath29 sdss spectra .",
    "these galaxies would most likely be intrinsically liner - like galaxies with emission line equivalent widths approaching zero and would be classed by us in the quiescent sample . using a linear least - squares fit of ew(h@xmath13 ) as a function of ew([oii ] ) and forcing the fit to go through the origin",

    "moreover , making no infill correction at all is obviously wrong , as can be seen by the substantial infill in the uncorrected h@xmath33 .",
    "any infill correction will only make the trend in h@xmath102 stronger .",

    "it is difficult to find a physical justification for this reversal of the trend in h@xmath33 ( and therefore age ) with emission strength , and furthermore this reversal is not corroborated by h@xmath101 or h@xmath102 ; the simpler explanation is that assuming a balmer decrement of h@xmath13/h@xmath109 _ underestimates _ the appropriate emission infill correction .",
    "figure [ balmer_comp]f shows that the reversal described here is hardly a significant effect but would be larger for even larger values of the balmer decrement ; therefore this argument suggests that h@xmath13/h@xmath109 is an upper limit on the balmer decrement .",
    "using h@xmath13/h@xmath62 gives consistent trends with liner - like emission strength versus @xmath2 for all balmer lines , with h@xmath33 line strengths that converge to a single value for all emission strengths at high @xmath2 .",

    "the first is one of simplicity and conceptual transparency . for models computed at fixed [ z / h ] , changing",
    "the @xmath13-enhancement of the model also changes [ fe / h ] .",
    "total metallicity is in fact dominated by oxygen ( an @xmath13-element ) , so that changing [ @xmath13/fe ] a small amount results in a large change in [ fe / h ] in order to keep [ z / h ] constant .",
    "it is therefore conceptually more complicated to keep track of how enhancing [ @xmath13/fe ] affects stellar populations because one must disentangle the effects of increasing @xmath13-elements from the effects of decreasing [ fe / h ] .",
    "one case where this is particularly important is that of the higher order balmer lines , which are strongly affected by fe i absorption lines in their continuum @xcite . in fixed [ z / h ] models , changing [ @xmath13/fe ]",
    "dramatically changes [ fe / h ] , which in turn has a strong effect on h@xmath101 and h@xmath102 .",
    "because the s06 models are computed at fixed [ fe / h ] , the model predictions for h@xmath101 and h@xmath102 are relatively insensitive to [ @xmath13/fe ] .",
    "this is discussed in detail in  [ hd_ages ] .",
    "a second benefit of computing models at fixed [ fe / h ] rather than fixed [ z / h ] is that oxygen , which dominates total metallicity , is notoriously difficult to measure in the integrated light of stellar populations . while [ o / h ] remains essentially unmeasured , it is safer not to claim knowledge of total [ z / h ]",
    "this will be discussed in more detail in  [ o_fe ] and  [ abuns ] .",
    "a related point is that [ fe / h ] is a parameter that is more directly related to measurable quantities ( i.e. , iron absorption lines such as fe5270 or fe5335 ) than is [ z / h ] , which depends on the abundances of many different elements .",
    "some of these elements are not measured by any stellar absorption line , including the dominant element oxygen .",
    "the s06 models take as input a set of abundance ratios and calculate lick index values for the given abundances at a range of ages and [ fe / h ] .",
    "the model produces grids of lick index values for ages between 1.2 and 17.7 gyr , and @xmath119[fe / h]@xmath120 for the solar - scale isochrone and @xmath121[fe / h]@xmath122 for the @xmath13-enhanced isochrone .",
    "the model grids can be used with index - index plots in the style pioneered by @xcite to determine the age and [ fe / h ] of an observed stellar population .",
    "because the various lick indices have different sensitivities to each elemental abundance , a best - fitting set of abundances can be found by tweaking the input abundances in the s06 models until all of the index - index plots give consistent values for the age and [ fe / h ] of the stellar population in question .",
    "the s06 models are limited to a subset of the lick indices due to the restricted wavelength coverage of the stellar spectra used to construct the fitting functions . only the balmer indices ( h@xmath33 , along with both the broad and narrow h@xmath15 and h@xmath16 indices ) , fe4383 , fe5015 , fe5270 , fe5335 , mg@xmath104 , mg _",

    "we also show results computed using the @xmath13-enhanced isochrone and with [ o / fe]=+0.3 for comparison . because na , si , and ti are @xmath13-elements , we force their abundances to follow [ mg / fe ] , while the iron - peak element cr tracks fe ( [ cr / fe ] = 0.0 ) .      fitting for the best set of input abundance ratios is done using the idl code package * ez_ages * ( graves & schiavon , in preparation ) .",
    "briefly , * ez_ages * implements the method developed by @xcite to determine abundances and ages of stellar populations .",

    "these indices are chosen because they are relatively insensitive to other , non - solar abundance ratios . *",
    "ez_ages * then uses an index - index plot of h@xmath33 and mg _ b _ to constrain [ mg / fe ] .",
    "this is done by varying [ mg / fe ] as input to the s06 model until the age and [ fe / h ] measured in the h@xmath33-mg _ b _ plot match the fiducial values from the h@xmath33-@xmath123fe@xmath124 plot . in similar fashion , c@xmath1044668 is used to determine [ c / fe ] , cn@xmath104 is used to determine [ n / fe ] once [ c / fe ] is set , and ca4227 is used to get [ ca / fe ] .",
    "the entire process is then iterated in order to produce a self - consistent set of abundances . *",
    "ez_ages * then measures separately an age from h@xmath101 and an age from h@xmath102 using the best - fitting abundances .",

    "only once [ c / fe ] and [ n / fe ] are determined can ca4227 be used to fit for [ ca / fe ] , in order to account for the strong dependence of ca4227 on cn . the fact that [ o / fe ] remains unknown contributes a significant uncertainty to all of these abundance determinations , but is unavoidable . when presenting abundance measurements for our data in  [ abuns ] , we will illustrate the effect of changing [ o / fe ] by 0.3 dex . in practice ,",

    "not only is oxygen the single most abundant metal in the universe , but main sequence turn - off temperatures are substantially affected by oxygen abundances @xcite .",

    "theoretical models of nucleosynthesis predict that mg and o both originate in type ii sne ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) and should track one another closely , but there is some evidence that this is not always the case . in a survey of 27 milky way",
    "bulge giants , @xcite find that , although mg appears to be enhanced at all [ fe / h ] , [ o / fe ] declines with increasing [ fe / h ] and is solar or mildly sub - solar at [ fe / h ] @xmath131 .",
    "this indicates that , at least in some stellar populations , the assumption that o varies in lockstep with mg is not valid . in addition , there is growing evidence from x - ray observations that the hot gas in elliptical galaxies has subsolar values of [ o / fe ] ( @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) and also subsolar [ o / mg ] @xcite , further undermining the assumption that mg and o vary together .    in light of these uncertainties , we treat [ o / fe ] as undetermined .",
    "the s06 ssp models are computed for fixed [ fe / h ] rather than fixed [ z / h ] so the uncertainty in total metallicity should not have a large effect on the results of the stellar population modeling . in the following sections , we present results based on both the solar abundance and @xmath13-enhanced isochrones available with * ez_ages * , and at each stage of the analysis illustrate the effect of changing the oxygen abundance by exploring a range of values for [ o / fe ] .",
    "the * ez_ages * code was used to estimate mean luminosity - weighted ages and abundances from lick index measurements for each of the stacked spectra . using the best - fitting abundance models , we obtained ages for each stacked spectrum , measured separately from the h@xmath33-@xmath123fe@xmath124 , h@xmath101-@xmath123fe@xmath124 , and h@xmath102-@xmath123fe@xmath124 grids",

    "figure [ ages_plot ] shows these age measurements as a function of the mean @xmath2 in each galaxy bin and emission line strength , for each of the stacked spectra .",
    "the left panel shows the measured ages when a balmer decrement of h@xmath13/h@xmath33 = 3.27 is assumed , while the center panel assumes h@xmath13/h@xmath33 = 4.1 . in both cases , the * ez_ages * fitting has been computed with a solar - scaled abundance isochrone .",

    "the error bars show the uncertainty in the ages due to measurement errors in the balmer lines and @xmath123fe@xmath124 only .",
    "the solid lines are linear least squares fits of age onto @xmath2 .",
    "the most striking result in this figure is that the galaxies with strong liner - like emission are systematically _ younger _ than their quiescent counterparts at the same @xmath2 , with weak liner - like galaxies falling in between .",
    "this trend exists in all of the age measurements , regardless of which balmer line is used , and for either balmer decrement .",
    "as expected from the line strength variations shown in figure [ balmer_comp ] , the h@xmath33 ages are most affected by the chosen decrement , while the h@xmath102 ages are essentially unaffected . in  [ infill_effect ] , we argued that the two values of the balmer decrement used here likely represent lower and upper boundaries for reasonable estimates of h@xmath13/h@xmath33 .",
    "thus the panels of figure [ ages_plot ] show the range of possible ssp age differences between quiescent and liner - like galaxies .",
    "the use of an @xmath13-enhanced isochrone with [ o / fe ] = + 0.3 ( right panel ) results in h@xmath33 ages that are consistently younger than those measured using a solar abundance isochrone but does not change the trend in age with emission strength .",
    "the difference in measured age between quiescent and strongly emitting galaxies is substantial  ranging from around 3.5 gyr in the lowest @xmath2 bin to 2 gyr in the highest @xmath2 bin with h@xmath13/h@xmath33 = 3.27 and a solar - scaled isochrone , as measured in all balmer lines .",
    "galaxies with liner - like emission contain stars which are on average 1040% _ younger _ than those in quiescent galaxies of the same @xmath2 ( using h@xmath33 ages ) .",
    "a second effect that is apparent in figure [ ages_plot ] is that galaxies with high @xmath2 are on average _ older _ than those with low @xmath2 .",
    "this trend is apparent in ages measured by all balmer lines , independent of the chosen balmer decrement , and for quiescent as well as emission line galaxies ( with the exception of h@xmath102 ages in quiescent galaxies which are @xmath132 gyr , regardless of @xmath2 ) .",
    "this suggests that more massive galaxies formed a larger percentage of their stars in the distant past than did less massive galaxies , which seems to be consistent with the so - called `` downsizing '' phenomenon ( @xcite , see also @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and many others ) .",
    "interestingly , the @xcite analysis of sdss stacked spectra from @xcite shows no increase in h@xmath33 age with galaxy absolute magnitude but a definite increase in h@xmath16 age , using the same models as in this work .",
    "that sample is selected predominantly by morphology and color , with no selection applied based on emission line properties . because of this , the @xcite sample likely contains not only quiescent and liner - like galaxies , but a small contaminating fraction of galaxies with seyfert and hii region emission as well .",
    "the emission infill correction applied by @xcite is inaccurate for these galaxies , and appears to cause the discrepancy in the trends seen in @xcite with the results presented here .",
    "appendix [ eis_data ] presents a detailed comparison between @xcite and this work .",
    "the stellar population modeling described above shows that the liner - like galaxies have younger ages than their quiescent counterparts at fixed @xmath2 ; it is natural to assume that they should therefore have slightly _ bluer _ colors .",
    "in fact , the opposite is true .",
    "as shown in figure [ g_r_sig ] , the liner - like galaxies typically have slightly _ redder _ colors than the quiescent galaxies at the same @xmath2 . the effect is small , ranging up to @xmath133 mag in _ @xmath134(g - r ) _ but is consistent across all galaxy bins . if the liner - like galaxies are indeed younger than the quiescent galaxies at the same @xmath2 , they must also be subject to a larger degree of intrinsic interstellar reddening , on average .",
    "this hypothesis is corroborated by the observation that liner - like galaxies appear to have stronger nad absorption than their quiescent counterparts , suggesting that they are subject to a greater amount of internal interstellar absorption ( see the discussion in  [ linestrength_trends ] ) .",
    "more quantitatively , the younger ages measured for the liner - like galaxies in the spectral line fitting ( figure [ ages_plot ] ) should make the liner - like galaxies @xmath135 mag _ bluer _ in @xmath136 , based on the stellar population models of @xcite .",
    "instead , they are observed to be @xmath137 mag _ redder _ in @xmath136 .",
    "this implies that the typical liner - like galaxy is subject to internal reddening of @xmath138 beyond the ( typically small ) internal reddening of quiescent red sequence galaxies .",
    "this modest amount of reddening is reasonably consistent with the value @xmath139 that was used in our preferred computation of the balmer decrement in ",
    "[ infill_correction ] , and is substantially smaller than the value @xmath55 that gives an upper boundary to reasonable values of h@xmath13/h@xmath33 above .    in the milky way",
    ", @xmath140 in the galactic plane roughly corresponds to interstellar nad absorption of @xmath141  @xcite .",
    "this is generally consistent with the excess of nad absorption in the liner - like galaxies needed to bring the nad stellar absorption strengths into line with the rest of the metal lines shown in figure [ indices ] .",
    "the relation between @xmath142 and nad interstellar absorption observed in the milky way varies substantially outside the galactic plane , making a calculation of @xmath142 from observed nad absorption necessarily inaccurate .",
    "however , it is clear that there is at least reasonable agreement between the internal reddening suggested by the median galaxy colors and the observed interstellar nad absorption in the liner - like galaxies .",
    "thus , liner - like galaxies typically suffer from a greater degree of internal reddening than their quiescent counterparts at fixed @xmath2 but this excess reddening is small , around @xmath143 on average .",
    "a third effect that is visible in figure [ ages_plot ] is that ages measured with different balmer lines vary systematically , such that bluer balmer lines produce younger age measurements .",
    "this is true for the quiescent galaxies as well as the liner - like galaxies , so it can not be an artifact of the emission infill correction .",
    "the balmer lines h@xmath101 and h@xmath102 have been shown to be sensitive to non - solar abundance ratios in models computed at fixed [ z / h ] .",
    "the effect of non - solar abundance ratios is strongest at high metallicity @xcite , and is thus particularly relevant for early type galaxies , whose metallicities are typically nearly solar or super - solar , unlike globular clusters , which are typically @xmath13-enhanced but are comparitively metal - poor . @xcite",
    "have demonstrated that , in models computed at fixed [ z / h ] , including the effects of @xmath13-enhancement raises the age estimates from h@xmath101 and h@xmath102 , and could thus in principal solve a discrepancy in which the bluer balmer lines are producing younger age estimates than h@xmath33 .",
    "however , the sensitivity of h@xmath101 and h@xmath102 is primarily a sensitivity to [ fe / h ] , rather than [ @xmath13/fe ] , and is an example of the complication of computing models at fixed [ z / h ] .",
    "the abundance ratio dependence of h@xmath101 and h@xmath102 is primarily due to the large number of iron absorption lines in the regions surrounding the h@xmath101 and h@xmath102 indices @xcite . for models at fixed [ z / h ] , choosing a model with too low",
    "a value of [ @xmath13/fe ] ( i.e. , a solar - scaled model when the galaxy is @xmath13-enhanced ) means that the model has too _ high _ a value of [ fe / h ] at fixed [ z / h ] .",
    "this makes the fe i absorption lines in the continuum regions on either side of the index passband too strong , lowering the continuum measurement and consequently lowering the measured value of the balmer absorption index in the models .",
    "this makes the observed balmer index look stronger in comparison to the models , and results in a _ younger _ age measurement . using the correct",
    "[ @xmath13/fe ] model fixes this problem , which has led @xcite to claim that @xmath13-enhancement effects cause younger ages to be measured in higher order balmer absorption lines . however , the effect is dominated by fe i lines . for models computed at fixed [ fe / h ] ,",
    "the effect of the iron abundance on h@xmath101 and h@xmath102 is accounted for , and does not depend on the @xmath13-enhancement of the model .",
    "thus the claimed [ @xmath13/fe]-dependence of ages measured from h@xmath101 and h@xmath102 is in fact a dependence on [ fe / h ] that is translated into an @xmath13-enhancement effect in models at constant [ z / h ] .",
    "the s06 models , which are computed at fixed [ fe / h ] rather than fixed [ z / h ] do not have this entangled dependency .",
    "the s06 models produce consistent age measurements from h@xmath33 , h@xmath101 , and h@xmath102 when they are used to analyze known ssps such as the galactic globular clusters 47 tuc , m5 , and ngc 6528 , and the open cluster m67 @xcite which span a wide range of ssp parameters .",
    "both 47 tuc and m5 are metal - poor systems for which the @xmath13-enhancement effect on h@xmath101 and h@xmath102 should be weak @xcite , and m67 is not significantly @xmath13-enhanced , thus these clusters are less relevant comparisons for high metallicity @xmath13-enhanced galaxies . however , ngc 6528 is relatively old , has roughly solar [ fe / h ] and is mildly @xmath13-enhanced , with @xmath144 gyr , [ fe / h]@xmath145 , [ mg / fe]@xmath146 and [ o / fe]@xmath147 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , summarized in table 10 of @xcite ) and is thus an excellent ssp analog for early type galaxy data .",
    "the s06 best - fitting model for ngc 6528 has [ fe / h]@xmath148 , [ mg / fe]@xmath149 , [ o / fe]@xmath150 , and produces h@xmath33 , h@xmath101 , and h@xmath102 ages of 13 , 10 , and 12 gyr , respectively , which are relatively consistent within the uncertainties in the models .",
    "in the red sequence galaxies analyzed in @xcite , however , the models produce age measurements that decrease as bluer balmer lines are used .",
    "@xcite has shown that the most likely explanation for this phenomenon is that galaxies are not ssps but contain stars with a range of ages .",
    "this effect has also been reported by @xcite ; they also interpret the differing age measurements from different balmer lines as due to extended star formation histories .    in @xcite ,",
    "four possible explanations for this phenomenon are discussed : the presence of a sub - population of young to intermediate - age stars , a significant number of blue stragglers , the presence of a metal - poor old stellar population with a blue horizontal branch , or the effects of strongly non - solar abundance ratios which are not constrained by the available lick indices . among these scenarios",
    ", @xcite concludes that a young - to - intermediate subpopulation is the most likely ; the blue horizontal branch scenario can not reproduce all three balmer lines simultaneously , the fraction of blue stragglers required to reproduce the observed line strengths is 10100 times larger than blue straggler populations observed in galactic globular clusters , and the abundance ratios that reproduce the observed line strengths seem extreme : [ o / fe ] = + 1.0 , or [ ti / fe ] = @xmath151 .",
    "in contrast , a small population of young - to - intermediate stars is sufficient to produce differences in balmer line strengths similar to those observed .",
    "@xcite shows that a 11.2 gyr ssp combined with a superimposed young population with age = 0.8 gyr and comprising 0.51.0% of the total stellar mass produces measured h@xmath33 age @xmath152 gyr and h@xmath102 age @xmath153 gyr .",
    "these ages correspond to the measured h@xmath33 and h@xmath102 ages of the @xmath100120 km s@xmath29 strong liner - like emission stacked spectrum shown in figure [ ages_plot ] , with h@xmath13/h@xmath33 = 3.27 , which can therefore be modeled as such a two - burst system .",
    "this simple example serves to illustrate that measurement and modeling of multiple balmer lines in a single system has the potential to reveal extended star formation histories .",
    "more sophisticated analysis of these galaxy spectra using composite stellar populations is beyond the scope of this work but is clearly worthy of future investigation .",
    "it is noteworthy that almost all of the stacked spectra in our sample  quiescent and liner - like , low @xmath2 and high @xmath2display this discrepancy in ages as measured by different balmer lines .",

    "one could postulate that the younger ages in bluer balmer lines , instead of indicating a composite stellar population , were in fact caused by an inadequate treatment of @xmath13-enhancement in the s06 models , although we have argued above that h@xmath101 and h@xmath102 are strongly affected by @xmath13-enhancement only in stellar population models computed at fixed [ z / h ] .",
    "a systematic variation of h@xmath101 and h@xmath102 with [ @xmath13/fe ] could produce the trend observed in the quiescent galaxies : that the higher @xmath2 galaxies ( which have higher [ mg / fe ] , as shown below in  [ abuns ] ) show younger ages in h@xmath101 and h@xmath102 than in h@xmath33 , but that all ages are nearly consistent in the lowest @xmath2 galaxy bins which have nearly solar abundance ratios .",

    "if we were to take the age trends in figure [ ages_plot ] at face value , the implication is that for quiescent galaxies , those with large @xmath2 have a spread of stellar ages , while those a lower @xmath2 are relatively close to ssps",

    "if the galaxies which have experienced relatively recent star formation episodes are predominantly found in the weak and strong liner - like classes , the classification by emission line strength may have isolated the low @xmath2 galaxies whose star formation ceased long ago and who may therefore be more likely to resemble ssps .",
    "it is not immediately clear , however , why this would not also be the case for more massive galaxies .",
    "a more detailed investigation of complex model star formation histories would be necessary to further interpret the trends seen in figure [ ages_plot ] , which we defer to future work .",
    "detailed analysis of the age differences between balmer lines may in fact be pushing the data farther than is reasonable , given the uncertainties in the stellar population modeling process and the unknown contribution of oxygen .",
    "in addition , any conclusion that is strongly dependent on the @xmath100120 km s@xmath29 and @xmath155145 km s@xmath29 bins should be regarded with caution , as those bins are known to be substantially incomplete ( see  [ completeness ] ) .",
    "an important caveat that pertains to both this work and the @xcite study is that each of these stacked spectra are composites of the spectra of several hundred galaxies .",

    "recently , @xcite have demonstrated that the ca4227 index is stronly affected by cn absorption in its blue continuum region and have suggested that redefining the ca4227 index to avoid this region results in a ca4227 index that is less sensitive to other element abundances .",

    "the abundance fitting process described in  [ fitting ] , which fits for [ c / fe ] and [ n / fe ] before using ca4227 to fit for [ ca / fe ] , should account for the cn effect on ca4227 .",
    "indeed , @xcite uses the same abundance fitting method as in this paper and finds that [ ca / fe ] does increase with galaxy luminosity in a set of stacked sdss spectra .",

    "we have checked their reported ages as a function of [ oiii ] emission line strength and confirm that the galaxies in their sample with @xmath89 [ oiii ] emission line detections are generally younger than their quiescent galaxies at similar @xmath2 .",
    "it is possible that only a subset of liner - like galaxies have younger ages , but these must then make up a significant fraction of the liner - like galaxies in order to substantially lower the mean liner - like galaxy ages to match observations .",
    "it is also clear from figure [ ages_plot ] that there can not be a one - to - one correlation between ssp age and liner - like emission strength because the mean h@xmath33 age of the highest-@xmath2 liner - like galaxies is _ older _ than the mean h@xmath33 age of lower-@xmath2 quiescent galaxies ; specifically , if liner - like emission existed in all galaxies with ages below some threshold value , all liner - like galaxies would be younger than all quiescent galaxies , regardless of @xmath2 , which is not seen .",
    "however , this trend disappears using h@xmath102 , where all mean ages of liner - like galaxies are younger than all the h@xmath102 mean ages of quiescent galaxies , even though this is not true of h@xmath33 .",
    "if , as suggested in @xcite , higher order balmer lines are more sensitive to the presence of very young stars , this may imply that liner - like galaxies have a larger fraction of relatively younger stars than quiescent galaxies , that is the liner - like galaxies have had more recent star formation than their quiescent counterparts .",
    "this does not mean that the liner - like galaxies are post - starburst systems , galaxies which have undergone a recent epoch of powerful star formation but are no longer forming stars .",
    "spectra of post - starburst galaxies show strong higher - order balmer absorption lines characteristic of a stars .",

    "it is also possible that the liner - like galaxies are undergoing low - level star formation which is contributing to the optical emission lines .",
    "the interpretation of the age difference between quiescent and liner - like galaxies is not straightforward , due to the lack of consensus as to the ionization mechanism driving liner - like emission ; it is in fact likely that liners and liner - like galaxies are a heterogeneous population @xcite .",
    "possible mechanisms for producing liner - like emission are :    photoionization by an agn continuum ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    photoionization by newly - formed o stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "shock ionization ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the shocks could be driven by starburst winds , gas accretion from a satellite galaxy or the surrounding inter - galactic medium , episodic agn feedback , or by galaxy interactions and/or mergers .    cooling flows ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "photoionization at early times ( @xmath178 myr , e.g. , @xcite ) or at late times ( 113 gyr , e.g. , @xcite ) by post - agb stars .    of these possibilities , photoionization or shock ionization by young stars and photoionization by post - agb stars",
    "are the most directly associated with the stellar population of the galaxy , and would thus give a potentially straight - forward connection between the presence of liner - like emission and the star formation history of a galaxy .",
    "in particular , if the observed liner - like emission in many of these galaxies is powered by young stars , it would not be at all surprising to discover that these galaxies have younger mean light - weighted ages .",
    "however , there are several indications that this explanation is too simple . first , @xcite",
    "show that the liner - like red sequence galaxies in their analysis have higher observed [ oii]/h@xmath33 ratios than either star - forming galaxies or agn ( i.e. galaxies with seyfert - like emission line ratios ) , and thus liner - like emission can not be produced by a superposition of hii regions and agn activity .",
    "this does not preclude the liner - like emission being caused by star formation through a mechanism other than hii region emission , however hii regions produce strong h@xmath33 emission and their presence would tend to weaken the [ oii]/h@xmath33 ratios of the galaxy .",
    "there are galaxies with liner - like emission that do show indications of containing starbursts .",

    "we therefore think it highly unlikely that these ir - luminous liner - like galaxies contribute significantly to the liner - like red sequence galaxies in this sample .    in the scenario where the bulk of the liner - like emission on the red sequence is produced by post - agb star photoionization",
    ", a correlation between liner - like emission and stellar population age would imply that either the amount of ionizing photons produced by the old stellar population or the supply of gas ( from stellar mass loss ) would depend upon the age of the stars in the galaxy , which is predicted by some models ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the other possible liner mechanisms mentioned above ( photoionization by an agn , shock ionization due to gas accretion , galaxy interactions , or merger activity , and cooling flows ) are not directly related to the stellar populations of the galaxies .",
    "to explain the correlation between ssp age and emission properties with any of these mechanisms requires a connection between the stellar population age of the galaxy and some quantity external to the galaxy ( accretion , interaction , cooling flows ) or internal to the galaxy but separate from the stellar population ( agn activity ) .",
    "this would also be true of a scenario in which the post - agb stars in the galaxy provide the ionizing photons but where the emission strength is determined by the supply of gas to be ionized , with the gas coming from an external source ( rather than from stellar mass loss ) .",
    "these `` external '' possibilities have interesting implications for galaxy evolution , in particular the possibility of ionization by low luminosity agn .",
    "this mechanism is favored by @xcite for centrally - concentrated liner emission , and has a tantalizing resonance with recent work suggesting that agn activity is involved in quenching star formation in galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and others ) . however , there is some evidence that the liner - like emission in many if not most early - type galaxies is extended throughout the galaxy , rather than being centrally concentrated ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) , suggesting that photoionization by an agn may not be the dominant mechanism driving liner - like emission in most early - type galaxies .",
    "unfortunately , it is outside the scope of this work to speculate as to which mechanism ( or mechanisms ) dominate the observed liner - like emission in red sequence galaxies , making it difficult to assess the physical cause of our observed result .",
    "it would be particularly interesting to perform an analysis similar to that presented here on a sample of galaxies with spatially resolved spectra , so that true nuclear liners could be analyzed separately from galaxies with extended liner - like emission .",

    "they appear to have metallicities and abundance patterns similar to quiescent galaxies .",
    "this result is robust to the details of the emission infill correction , the enhancement pattern of the isochrone used to construct comparison models , and the ( unknown ) oxygen abundance of the galaxies .",
    "many properties of red sequence galaxies stellar populations vary with galaxy velocity dispersion , including ssp age , [ fe / h ] , and abundance ratios .",

    "if the interpretation presented in @xcite is correct , the discrepant age measurements observed in this analysis indicate the presence of composite stellar populations . from the work presented here ,",
    "it is not possible to tell whether the individual galaxies that go into each stacked spectrum are themselves composite stellar populations with similar star formation histories , or whether the individual galaxies are true ssps of different ages which produce a composite population when they are combined together .",
    "the correlation between the presence of liner - like emission and intrinsically younger stellar populations demonstrates that there is a link between the mechanism driving the emission and the star formation history of the galaxy .",
    "if the liner - like emission in red sequence galaxies is primarily driven by agn activity , this may be an indication that agn do indeed play a role in ending star formation activity .",
    "alternatively , if the liner - like emission in most of these galaxies is controlled entirely by the properties of the stellar population itself ( e.g. gas lost from evolved stellar envelopes which is ionized by uv flux from post - agb stars ) , the correlation with stellar population age may provide important constraints on models for the uv flux from low mass stars or for the rate of mass loss in a stellar population over time .",

    "each of these six bins is then divided into three bins in absolute magnitude , with equal numbers of galaxies in each magnitude bin .",
    "the median magnitudes of galaxies in the bright bins are @xmath176 mag brighter than those in the middle bins at the same @xmath2 , which are in turn @xmath176 mag brighter than those in the faint bins .",
    "galaxies are coadded within each bin ( using the process described in  [ composite_spectra ] ) , and the lick indices and d@xmath1054000 are measured in each of the @xmath2-magnitude binned spectra .",
    "measured line strengths are shown as a function of @xmath2 in figure [ siglum_indices ] . in each @xmath2 range , the brightest , middle , and faintest magnitude bins are shown in red , green , and blue , respectively . as in figure [ indices ] , error bars include statistical errors only , and the lines show a least squares fit of index strength onto @xmath2 separately for the brightest , middle , and faintest galaxies at each @xmath2 .",
    "for ease of comparison , the axis scales in each index plot are the same as in figure [ indices ] .    from figure [ siglum_indices ]",
    ", it is clear that the stellar populations of red sequence galaxies _ do _ vary with absolute magnitude at fixed @xmath2 .",
    "the iron lines ( figure [ siglum_indices]b ) in particular are considerably stronger in bright galaxies than in faint ones .",
    "however , the balmer lines and g4300 ( figure [ siglum_indices]a ) show little variation , while other lines ( figure [ siglum_indices]cd ) show some slight variation with magnitude .",
    "this suggests that at fixed @xmath2 , brighter galaxies have higher metallicities and slightly younger ages compared to fainter galaxies .",
    "the low @xmath2 bins of the quiescent and liner - like galaxy sample are biased toward brighter objects and therefore , because of the variation in line strengths with magnitude , toward _ stronger _",
    "absorption lines for all lines shown in figure [ siglum_indices]b - d .",
    "a correction for this effect is computed as follows : we assume that the characteristics of the galaxies missing from each @xmath2 bin are similar to the faint galaxies that are included in the bin , and that the mean measured properties of the bin are similar to those of the middle magnitude bin .",
    "for each measured index , the difference between the middle magnitude bin and the faint bin at fixed @xmath2 is computed by subtracting the linear fit to the middle magnitude bins ( green lines in figure [ siglum_indices ] ) from the faint bins ( blue lines ) .",
    "the line strength differential at each @xmath2 is multiplied by the corresponding incompleteness fraction ( see table [ bin_table ] ) , so that the @xmath100120 km s@xmath29 bin has the largest correction because it is most incomplete , while the @xmath77 - 300 bin has no correction because it is complete by assumption ( see  [ completeness ] ) .",
    "this scaled correction is then subtracted from the measured line strengths in the quiescent , weak , and strong emission bins at each value of @xmath2 .",
    "the scaled corrections for each index are given in table [ incomplete_table ] for the five lowest @xmath2 bins ( the highest @xmath2 bin is assumed to be complete , so no correction is applied ) .",
    "implicit in this treatment is that the relative line strength differences with magnitude are the same for liner - like galaxies as for quiescents .",
    "the corrected line strengths are shown in figure [ indices ] in the right - hand column of each panel . comparing the corrected with the uncorrected ( left - hand column ) values ,",
    "it is clear that the corrections are small and are negligible in the balmer lines and g4300 . in the case of the metal lines ( figure [ indices]b - d ) , they operate in the sense of slightly _ enchancing _ trends in line strength with @xmath2 .",
    "they have no effect on the relative line strengths of galaxy bins with differing emission properties because the same correction was applied to all bins at the same @xmath2 .",
    "although the results presented in this work are generally consistent with the analysis of stacked sdss spectra in @xcite , there are a number of differences worthy of deeper investigation .",
    "@xcite finds no trend in age with galaxy luminosity when using h@xmath33 to compute mean ages , but finds that galaxy age increases with increasing luminosity when ages are computed using h@xmath102 .",
    "in contrast , we find age increasing with @xmath2 regardless of which balmer line is used in the fitting process . in addition , @xcite finds that [ ca / fe ] increases with galaxy luminosity , whereas we find practically no trend in [ ca / fe ] with @xmath2 .",
    "it is difficult to directly interpret these differences , as the @xcite results are presented as a function of galaxy absolute magnitude , rather than @xmath2 .    in order to make a more direct comparison between the results of @xcite and those presented here , we have taken the same galaxy sample used in our main analysis and divided the galaxies into bins based on absolute magnitude , rather than @xmath2 . as before ,",
    "galaxies with weak and strong liner - like emission are stacked separately from those with no detectable emission lines . for this process",
    ", we have used the galaxy absolute @xmath4-band magnitude , k - corrected to z=0.0 in order to match the @xcite data which made use of stacked spectra from @xcite .",
    "we then measure lick indices and fit for stellar population mean ages , abundances , and abundance ratios as described in  [ linestrengths ] and  [ modeling ] above .",
    "figure [ eis_abuns ] shows the results of the stellar population modeling for our luminosity - binned sample ( black stars ) , as compared to the results from @xcite ( grey triangles ) .",
    "values of [ fe / h ] appear slightly higher in the @xcite results than in our luminosity - binned sample , by a few hundredths of a dex .",
    "the typical values for the abundance ratios are comparable between the two data sets , but the @xcite values show consistently stronger trends with magnitude than do our data .",
    "again , the discrepancies are all within a few hundredths of a dex . the largest discrepancies between the data sets are in the age measurements .",
    "here our data show slightly older ages for more luminous galaxies , while the @xcite results show slightly _ younger _ ages for more luminous galaxies .    because both the @xcite stacked spectra and the stacked spectra in our sample were acquired as part of the same survey and have been analyzed using the same method , any differences in the results should be due to differences in the sample selection process .",
    "the sample selection criteria are in fact quite different between the two samples .",
    "both samples are taken from the sdss main galaxy sample .",
    "the @xcite spectra used in @xcite are chosen using two morphological criteria : that the galaxies have concentrated light profiles ( determined from the sdss concentration parameter @xmath180 , see @xcite for details ) and by requiring that a de vaucouleurs fit to the light profile be 20 times more likely than an exponential fit .",
    "most of these galaxies lie on the red sequence ; an additional color criterion is applied to exclude color outliers , removing about 5% of the morphologically selected galaxies from the sample .",
    "it is important to highlight here that no spectral criteria are applied .",
    "many of the galaxies in the @xcite stacked spectra may therefore include emission lines from ionized gas .",
    "in fact , the principle component analysis in @xcite shows that there is a significant component of emission in the galaxies in their sample . @xcite",
    "have shown that red sequence galaixes ( chosen by a color criterion only , without any morphological selection ) consist of about 48% quiescent galaxies without emission lines , 29% galaxies with liner - like emission , and 23% galaxies with emission characteristic of seyferts or hii regions . the morphological selection applied by @xcite",
    "may remove some fraction of the seyferts and star - forming galaxies from the red sequence , but a contaminating population of galaxies with emission due to low - level star formation or seyfert activity likely exists at the roughly 10% level .    before measured lick indices and analyzing the stellar populations of the stacked @xcite spectra",
    ", @xcite corrects for emission infill in the stacked spectra by measuring the strength of the [ oii]@xmath343727 line and applying the conversion from [ oii ] ew to h@xmath13 ew determined in @xcite . a standard balmer decrement",
    "is then used to correct h@xmath33 , h@xmath101 , and h@xmath102 . however",
    ", this conversion is appropriate only for galaxies with liner - like emission line ratios .",
    "the @xcite spectra may contain some fraction of seyferts and low - level star formation .",
    "for these galaxies , the strength of h@xmath13 emission is much higher for a given [ oii ] ew , thus the emission infill correction performed by @xcite may _ undercorrect _ for infill in the balmer lines , to the extent that galaxies in the sample have non - liner - like emission line ratios . as discussed in ",
    "[ infill_effect ] , h@xmath33 will be much more sensitive to the effects of infill than will the bluer balmer lines .",
    "figure [ eis_indices ] shows lick index measurements as a function of galaxy absolute magnitude for our sample ( black stars ) and for the @xcite stacked spectra ( grey triangles ) .",
    "only lick indices that are used in the abundance fitting process are shown .",
    "the balmer lines ( left panel ) differ significantly between the two data sets , while the metal lines fe5270 , fe5335 , mg _ b _ , c@xmath1044668 , cn@xmath104 , and ca4227 are relatively consistent . in our luminosity - binned data ,",
    "all three balmer line strengths decrease as galaxy luminosity increases .",
    "the same trend is seen in h@xmath102 and h@xmath101 for the @xcite data , although the line strengths are offset toward stronger absorption compared to our data .",
    "this suggests that the @xcite sample of galaxies includes a larger fraction of intermediate - age galaxies than does our own .",
    "this offset in mean stellar population age between the samples is not unexpected .",
    "the galaxies included in our luminosity - binned sample , as in the @xmath2-binned sample used in the main analysis presented above , have been selected with a fairly stringent color cut , which excludes the blue side of the red sequence ( see figure [ sample_cuts ] ) .",
    "no such stringent cut has been applied to the @xcite galaxies .",
    "that sample therefore contains a sizable fractin of galaxies which are as much as 0.1 mag bluer in @xmath181 than our galaxy sample and therefore may include a significant sub - population of intermediate - age galaxies which are excluded from our sample .",
    "also , as discussed earlier , the @xcite data likely include a modest fraction of galaxies with low - level star formation because galaxies have not been excluded on the basis of emission lines . including these galaxies would bias the sample toward younger mean ages .",
    "it is true that the star - forming galaxies also have stronger balmer emission infill , which we have argued is likely to be under - corrected .",
    "however , the effect on the blue balmer lines is small both in terms of the total amount of infill and the amount of correction applied , thus the inaccuracies in accounting for the infill in h@xmath102 and h@xmath101 should not be large .",
    "this is not true for h@xmath33 , where the emission infill is substantial and therefore the effect of the under - correction could be significant . indeed , h@xmath33 behaves differently in the @xcite stacked spectra than in our luminosity - binned spectra ; h@xmath33 remains roughly constant over a range of galaxy absolute magnitude in the @xcite data whereas h@xmath33 strengths decline for brighter galaxies in our sample .",
    "the contant values of h@xmath33 are also qualitatively different from the h@xmath102 and h@xmath101 indices in both the @xcite data and in our data , where balmer absorption declines with increasing galaxy luminosity everywhere .",
    "it seems likely that the h@xmath33 values measured in the @xcite data suffer from an improper infill correction which has dramatic effects on h@xmath33 but less so on h@xmath102 and h@xmath101 , and none at all on the metal lines .",
    "the metal lines in fact appear very similar between the two different data sets .",
    "there is some indication that metal absorption strengths are slightly lower in the @xcite data , which would be consistent with the supposition that those data include a larger fraction of intermediate - age galaxies than do our data .",
    "the slopes of the relations between line strengths and galaxy magnitude are in good agreement between the two samples .",
    "we therefore conclude that the slight differences in the ages and abundance patterns reported by @xcite as compared to the results presented in this paper are due to differing trends in the h@xmath33 line strengths that are used to compute the fiducial galaxy ages ( see  [ modeling ] ) , rather than genuine differences in abundance patterns .",
    "these differing trends in measured h@xmath33 line strengths are due to differences in sample selection coupled with less accurate emission infill corrections applied to the @xcite data in @xcite . in order for this to explain the observed flat relationship between h@xmath33 absorption strength and galaxy luminosity",
    ", the fainter galaxies would have to be more affected by under - corrected emission infill ( in other words , the fainter galaxies would have to have a larger fraction of galaxies with emission having non - liner - like line ratios ) .",
    "it seems reasonable that the fainter @xcite galaxies , which are observed to have much stronger h@xmath102 absorption than the brighter galaxies , are more likely to contain residual star formation and weak hii region emission than the brighter galaxies .",
    "it should be noted that the differences in abundances shown in figure [ eis_abuns ] between the two data sets are never more than 0.05 dex .",
    "although different sample selection and inaccurate emission infill corrections pose problems for precision stellar population determinations , there does not seem to be a catastrophic discrepancy created by moderate differences in the input data .",
