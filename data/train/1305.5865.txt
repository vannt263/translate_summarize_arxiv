    "we limit ourselves to the `` identikit 1 '' technique of bh09 , which relies on manual investigation of parameter space .",

    "test particle disks from these simulations can then be loaded on demand from within the identikit interface and compared to data .    in general ,",
    "matching simulations to data is made easier by the existence of tidal tails , which evolve ballistically once created and therefore retain memory of the initial encounter passage .",
    "their global morphology and kinematics are not strongly modified by self - gravity and so should be well - matched by test - particles .",
    "in contrast , strong spiral arms and other self - gravitating features will not be well reproduced by the test particles .",
    "a key aspect of identikit is the interface to display position and velocity information derived from data cubes simultaneously with results from simulations .",
    "the standard view is a 4 panel display ( e.g. , figure 1 of bh09 , figure [ fig : idkn5257 ] of this paper ) , showing the sky view ( @xmath69 , top left ) , two position - velocity views ( @xmath70-@xmath66 & @xmath67-@xmath70 , bottom left and top right ) , and a `` top down '' view ( @xmath66-@xmath62 , bottom right ) .    the subset of test particles from a specific instance ( @xmath56 , @xmath48 , @xmath50 , @xmath49 @xmath51 s , @xmath52 s ) of a hybrid simulation is loaded from the grid of models described in section [ ssec : test ] and overlaid on the sky - plane and position - velocity diagrams .",
    "identikit can move through a grid of pre - computed models , stepping through time , pericentric separation and mass ratio .",
    "disk orientations can be changed with the display updating in real - time .",
    "scalings and the viewing direction can also be changed in real - time to match the data .",
    "the data constraints are provided via three of the four panels described above .",
    "the source of these constraints may vary according to the available data .",
    "we generally employ sky - plane visualizations using deep optical images overlaid with contours of the hi .",
    "the hi  and stellar tails may not be co - spatial for reasons including : different scale lengths of the stellar and gaseous disks in the progenitors , ionization effects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or dissipation from an extended gas disk @xcite .",
    "using both hi  and starlight ensures the effect of the tidal interaction is accurately visualized .",
    "we utilize red optical filters in order to avoid being biased by young stellar populations .",
    "extinction is generally low in the tails so the extended morphology is relatively unbiased by the use of optical images .",
    "the resolution of the hi  is the limiting factor in terms of kinematic constraints but is sufficient for model matching .",
    "the higher resolution optical images are not degraded to the resolution of the hi , as they may provide additional posterior constraints on the match ( e.g. , the width of the tidal tails , the match of self - gravitating features such as spiral arms ) .",
    "the position - velocity diagrams were created using projections of the hi  data cube , taken along either the @xmath66 or the @xmath67 axes .",
    "an image with the maximum voxel value along the specified axis was used .",
    "this method tends to provide a more complete view of the spatial distribution of the emission , as faint emission is nt averaged together with noise .",
    "a consequence of this is that the projections do nt represent the total emission at that point in @xmath71 space .",
    "therefore , comparing the data value in a given location of a projection with the density of simulation particles in that same region is not a reliable metric for evaluating the accuracy of a match .      before matching in identikit",

    "the general disk orientations ( prograde vs. retrograde ) can be guessed at using the length and prominence of tidal features . for the orbit , @xmath72 is assumed based on cosmological considerations : the galaxies should have a high - eccentricity orbit with a period comparable to the hubble time . as noted above , the mass ratio @xmath48 can be estimated from the relative luminosities of each galaxy , if they are still separable , or from the relative length of the tidal tails . for this work ,",
    "we limited ourselves to @xmath73 or @xmath74 mass ratios .    with rough parameter estimates for each source ,",
    "the data projections were loaded into identikit and test particles with a specific initial angular momentum overplotted ( with that initial angular momentum corresponding to a requested initial disk orientation ) .",
    "disk orientations , time since pericenter , viewing angles and length / velocity scalings were varied until an acceptable match to the morphological and velocity information were obtained .",
    "typically , approximate disk orientations were established and then the viewing angles explored until a near match of the tidal features is obtained .",
    "the match is then refined by alternately improving the disk angles and the viewing angles . finally , length and velocity scalings were adjusted to obtain a suitable match to the velocity and spatial extents .",
    "these matches were determined by eye and were judged on the basis of having test particles in regions of the data projections where there is either stellar emission or hi  emission .",
    "the presence of test particles in regions without emission is not always an issue as emission could be missing due to effects not included in our simulations ( e.g. , ionization of the gas ) .    despite the lack of a dissipational component in the hybrid simulations",
    ", matching these test particles to the kinematics of gas is still valid in the tails .",
    "this is because gas in the tails does not experience significant dissipation as it moves outwards .",
    "a mass scaling ( @xmath57 ) can be derived from the velocity and length scalings , which allows one to estimate the dynamical mass of the system ) . ] .",
    "the dynamical masses estimated from these simulations should be considered a lower limit to the true dynamical mass of a system .",
    "lower values of the dynamical mass would be inconsistent with the velocity width and sizes observed in the objects . due to the logarithmic dependence of the gravitational potential on the halo mass , increasing the halo mass",
    "would not significantly alter the velocity and length scalings .",
    "in other words , once the minimum mass threshold is reached , the sensitivity of these scalings to the dynamical mass is reduced .    for evaluation of test particle matches ,",
    "the most weight is given to the extended tidal features .",
    "as these evolve ballistically after the initial passage , self - gravity should be relatively unimportant and will be suitably matched by test particles .",
    "features such as spiral arms , which require self - gravity , will not be reproduced by these massless test particles . as a result , mis - matches in the main bodies of the galaxy between the observations and the hybrid n - body and test particle simulations are to expected . indeed , taking the parameters from an identikit match and re - simulating them with a self - gravitating disk",
    "is a useful discriminant between models , particularly in systems lacking prominent tidal features .",
    "bh09 tested identikit by matching 36 simulated mergers without prior knowledge of a subset of the parameters ( the mass model , mass ratio , and orbital eccentricity were fixed , all other parameters were randomly chosen as described in the paper ) .",
    "the viewing directions and spin orientations were typically recovered to within @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "the time since pericenter was also well - recovered , with no obvious biases in the determination of that parameter .",
    "the determination of the pericentric separation , while not showing an offset , did show the largest scatter .",
    "the determination of the pericentric separation is likely uncertain by a factor of two .",
    "the only parameter which shows a noticeable bias in the best fit values compared to the true values is the velocity scaling .",
    "however , this is easily explained by the lack of velocity dispersion in the test - particle method .",
    "the test - particle disks , which initially have zero velocity dispersion , are being used to match tails formed from disks with a non - zero velocity dispersion .",
    "the velocity scaling determined by test - particle matching would thus be inflated to compensate for this .      after matching a dynamical model using identikit ,",
    "self - consistent simulations were carried out to verify the solution , refine the model parameters , and ensure self - gravitating features are matched .",
    "all simulations were carried out using the zeno software .",
    "model galaxies were created with a nfw dark matter halo and spherical bulge .",
    "in contrast with the identikit method , a disk of gravitating particles was inserted with the specified ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) values .",
    "our n - body simulations used 64k particles per galaxy : 8k bulge particles , 24k disk particles , and 32k dark matter halo particles .",
    "eighty per - cent of the mass is in a dark matter halo and the remaining twenty per - cent is baryons ( the bulge and the disk ) .",
    "these galaxy models were placed on initially keplerian orbits with @xmath50 and @xmath49 values taken from the identikit solution , then evolved using a treecode .",

    "the circular velocity at 3 disk scale lengths is approximately 1.26 .",
    "these lengths and velocities can be converted to physical units using the scalings derived for each model . for the details of the construction of our n - body realizations",
    "see appendix b of bh09 .",
    "once the system has been evolved numerically , particles in the self - gravitating disks were loaded into the identikit visualization system and compared with the same data projections used to constrain the test particle model .",

    "<S> we present dynamical models of four interacting systems : ngc 5257/8 , the mice , the antennae , and ngc 2623 . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter space of the encounters are constrained using the identikit model - matching and visualization tool . </S>",
    "<S> identikit utilizes hybrid n - body and test particle simulations to enable rapid exploration of the parameter space of galaxy mergers . </S>",
    "<S> the identikit - derived matches of these systems are reproduced with self - consistent collisionless simulations which show very similar results . </S>",
    "<S> the models generally reproduce the observed morphology and hi  kinematics of the tidal tails in these systems with reasonable properties inferred for the progenitor galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the models presented here are the first to appear in the literature for ngc 5257/8 and ngc 2623 , and the mice and the antennae are compared with previously published models . based on the assumed mass model and our derived initial conditions , </S>",
    "<S> the models indicate the four systems are currently being viewed 175 - 260 myr after first passage and cover a wide range of merger stages . </S>",
    "<S> in some instances there are mismatches between the models and the data ( e.g. , in the length of a tail ) ; these are likely due to our adoption of a single mass model for all galaxies . despite the use of a single mass model , </S>",
    "<S> these results demonstrate the utility of identikit in constraining the parameter space for galaxy mergers when applied to real data . </S>"
