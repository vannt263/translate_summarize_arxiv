    "the un - obscured emitting region on the receding jet , the double - stream model can be ruled out for double - peaked emitter 3c390.3 ( livio & xu 1997 ) . through the long - period observational results ,",
    "binary black hole model has also been ruled out due to unreasonable large central bh masses for some double - peaked emitters , such as arp102b , 3c390.3 ( eracleous et al .",
    "furthermore , based on the long - period variations of double - peaked broad emission lines , accretion disk model is successfully applied to reproduce the characters of varying observed line profiles of double - peaked emitters , such as the individual double - peaked emitter ngc1097 ( storchi - bergmann et al .",

    "besides the best fitted results for double - peaked broad emission lines by theoretical models , based on the pioneer work by blandford & mckee ( 1982 ) , geometrical structures of blrs can be mathematically structured by so - called transfer function in the reverberation mapping technique through some special mathematical methods ( such as the maximum entropy method , narayan & nityananda , 1986 ) applied to the properties of long - period observational varying both continuum emission and broad line emission ( peterson et al . 1993 , 1994 , horne et al .",

    "1995 ) is preferred , because the model can explain most of the observational spectral features of broad double - peaked emission lines ( especially features for extended asymmetric line wings ) with less number of necessary model parameters .",

    "2007 ) , the seven disk parameters in elliptical accretion disk model can be well determined .",
    "the procedures to determine the disk parameters for blrs of 3c390.3 are as follows .",
    "first and foremost , in order to check the results from reverberation mapping technique under the structures of blrs supposed by the accretion disk model , we should measure reliable theoretical disk parameters for disk - like blrs of 3c390.3 . before starting to fit the observed broad double - peaked h@xmath0",
    ", we first check the spectra of 3c390.3 by eye , and find that the spectra marked with ce ( corresponding observatory can be found in table 1 in dietrich et al .",
    "1998 ) have some unexpected absorption features around 6500@xmath6 in rest wavelength .",
    "the weird absorption features can not be found in the other spectra observed by instruments in other observatories , which should bring some larger uncertainties in measured disk parameters when broad h@xmath0 is fitted by accretion disk model .",
    "thus the absorption features ( rest wavelength from 6507@xmath6 to 6525@xmath6 ) in the 24 spectra marked with ce should be rejected , when the broad h@xmath0 are fitted by the elliptical accretion disk model for 3c390.3 .",
    "besides the weird absorption features in the 24 spectra marked with ce , in order to reduce the effects of narrow emission lines ( [ oi]@xmath14 , [ nii]@xmath15 , [ sii]@xmath16 and narrow h@xmath0 ) in all the spectra , the parts of narrow emission lines are also masked when broad h@xmath0 are fitted , rest wavelength from 6268@xmath6 to 6326@xmath6 for [ oi]@xmath17 , rest wavelength from 6350@xmath6 to 6388@xmath6 for [ oi]@xmath18 , rest wavelength from 6533@xmath6 to 6619@xmath6 for [ nii]@xmath15 and narrow h@xmath0 , rest wavelength from 6703@xmath6 to 6743@xmath6 for [ sii]@xmath16 ( the grey shadows shown in figure [ sps ] , figure [ res ] and figure  [ unique ] ) . in other words , only the double - peaked broad component of h@xmath0 without weird absorption features and without narrow emission lines are fitted .",
    "after the prepared work , the double - peaked broad h@xmath0 are fitted two times as follows .",
    "firstly , the 39 spectra with high quality ( more than 280 reliable data points within rest wavelength range from 6160@xmath6 to 6920@xmath6 ) and without unexpected absorption features around 6500@xmath6 are fitted by the elliptical accretion disk model . then through the measured disk parameters ,",
    "the two parameters of eccentricity and inclination angle are firstly determined for the 39 spectra , because eccentricity and inclination angle should not be changed with passage of time .",
    "the mean values of the two parameters for the 39 spectra are accepted as the reliable values for the two parameter .",
    "then all the 66 spectra are fitted again by the accretion disk model with the accepted constant inclination angle and eccentricity .",
    "figure [ sps ] shows the best fitted results for some selected broad h@xmath0 by elliptical accretion disk model with mjd from 49770 to 50051 . in the figure ,",
    "two spectra with unexpected absorption features ( marked with 49860ce and 49984ce ) are also shown , the shadow areas represent the masked ranges for narrow emission lines .",
    "figure [ res ] shows the corresponding residuals ( @xmath19 , observed data minus expected model data ) for the shown examples in figure [ sps ] . in the figure , shadow areas represent the narrow emission lines , each double horizontal dashed lines represent the range of [ @xmath20,@xmath21 , where @xmath22 representing the zero point for each spectrum are shown as solid horizontal line in the figure .",
    "the results shown in figure [ res ] and in figure [ sps ] indicate that the elliptical disk model is better for double - peaked broad emission lines of 3c390.3 , and further indicate that the probable existing hot spots and/or warped structures have few effects on the measured flux density of broad h@xmath0 and few effects on our final results and conclusion , i.e. , the hot spots and/or ward structures are weak for observed spectra of 3c390.3 around 1995 , and elliptical accretion disk model is efficient and sufficient for 3c390.3 around 1995 .",
    "figure [ par_dis ] shows the distributions of the seven disk parameters , and the distributions of the parameter of @xmath23 ( the value of the summed squared residuals divided by the degree of freedom for the returned model parameter values , which is one parameter as the residual to determine whether the theoretical model is preferred ) for the 39 high quality spectra in upper three panels and for all the 66 spectra in the other six panels .",
    "the final accepted disk parameters are : inner radius @xmath24 , outer radius @xmath25 , eccentricity @xmath26 , inclination angle @xmath27 , orientation angle @xmath28 , emissivity power slope @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) and local broadening velocity @xmath31 .",
    "actually , we should note that some of the theoretical disk parameters , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath32 , @xmath13 , @xmath10 , should depend on the strength of continuum emission , in other words , the parameters are time dependent .",
    "however , there need to be long - term progressive changes in the ionizing flux to change these variables .",
    "moreover , from the results shown in figure  [ par_dis ] , we can find that there are tiny variations for these parameters , which indicates that the mean values for the theoretical disk parameters can be used to trace the actual physical disk parameters for 3c390.3 around 1995 .    before proceeding further",
    ", we compare our measured disk parameters with the previous results reported in the literature . in the sample of double - peaked emitters from radio galaxies ,",
    "eracleous & halpern ( 1994 ) gave the results about disk parameters for blrs through circular accretion disk model ( chen et al .",
    "1989 ) for double - peaked broad h@xmath0 observed in 1988 for 3c390.3 ( simple results can also be found in figure 6 and in section 4.5 in sambruna et al .",
    "2009 ) , which are some different from our results determined through elliptical accretion disk model ( eracleous et al .",
    "we know that in accretion disk model , full width at zero intensity ( fwzi ) of double - peaked broad emission lines sensitively depends on inner radius of disk - like blrs , smaller inner radius leads to broader fwzi . from the fitted results shown in figure 4 in eracluous & halpern ( 1994 ) , we can find that in order to better fit the broad wings of broad h@xmath0 , the inner radius should be some smaller than 380@xmath33 ( the one listed in eracluous & halpern 1994 ) .",
    "thus our inner radius @xmath34 should be reasonable .",
    "peak separation sensitively depends on the outer radius , thus there are similar results about outer radius in eracluous & halpern ( 1994 ) and in our paper . in order to better fit the cusp feature around blue peak",
    ", the elliptical disk model should be more efficient than the totally symmetric circular disk model , i.e. , the parameters of eccentricity and orientation angle should be active .",
    "the separation between peak intensity and zero intensity of blue ( or red ) part of h@xmath0 should depends on the emissivity power slope .",
    "the larger distance between our inner radius and outer radius indicates that our emissivity slope should be smaller than 3 ( the one listed in eracluous & halpern 1994 ) .",
    "thus our emissivity slope @xmath35 should be reasonable .",
    "line width of double - peaked broad line sensitively depends on inclination angle , thus it is clear there are similar value about inclination angle @xmath36 in our paper and in eracluous & halpern ( 1994 ) . because the elliptical accretion disk model is more efficient for 3c390.3 than the circular accretion disk model",
    ", the effects from local broadening velocity should be lower .",
    "thus our local broadening velocity @xmath37 smaller than 1900@xmath38 in eracluous & halpern ( 1994 ) should be reasonable .    besides the disk parameters , it is interesting to check the variations of line profiles of double - peaked broad h@xmath0 .",
    "as shown in veilleux & zheng ( 1991 ) , there are significant variations of relative flux ratio of the two peaks within the period from 1974 to 1988 .",
    "certainly , the variations can not be successfully explained by the elliptical accretion disk model , because the disk precession period of 3c390.3 based on the elliptical accretion disk model is about several hundreds of years as we should discuss in the following .",
    "however , during the period ( about 500days ) around 1995 included in agn watch project , the variations of flux ratio of the two peaks are tiny as shown in figure [ var ] . in the figure ,",
    "two kinds of flux ratios are shown , the one with mean value of @xmath39 ( 0.02 is standard deviation for the mean value ) is the ratio of the blue part to red part of broad h@xmath0 divided by 6564.61@xmath6 ( the theoretical center wavelength of h@xmath0 ) , the other one with mean value of @xmath40 ( 0.06 is standard deviation ) is the intensity ratio of the blue peak to red peak .",
    "similar results for 3390.3 around 1995 can also be found in dietrich et al .",
    "the more recent results about the flux ratio of the two peaks of 3c390.3 from 1995 to 2007 can be found in shapovalova et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , there are tiny variations of the flux ratio of the two peaks in the 5years period as shown in figure 13 in shapovalova et al .",
    "( 2010 ) . due to the tiny variations",
    ", we believe that there are tiny variations for disk parameters obtained from the observed spectra during 1995 , and that is the reason why we select the spectra observed around 1995 .",
    "in other words , the structures of blrs of 3c390.3 are stable around 1995 , which re - confirm that there are tiny variations of disk parameters shown in figure  [ par_dis ] .",
    "last but not least , we should note the collected 66 spectra in optical band for 3c390.3 are the observed spectra before the intercaliberation method ( van groningen & wanders 1992 ) applied to consider the effects from different observational instruments in different configurations as discussed in dietrich et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . in this paper",
    ", we mainly focus on the disk parameters , rather than the flux densities of broad h@xmath0 which should be directly collected from agn watch project with contamination being corrected . the main effect from intercaliberation method on the corrected line profile",
    "is the broadening velocity in the method .",
    "however , the broadening velocity is only about tens of kilometers per second when intercaliberation method is applied , which is much smaller than line width of broad h@xmath0 .",
    "thus , the effects from intercaliberation method on the measured disk parameters through elliptical accretion disk model can be totally ignored .    before to finish the section , we consider the following question whether there are other values for disk parameters in the disk model applied to well fit observed double - peaked broad h@xmath0 . in other words , the question is whether the solutions to the disk parameters are unique .",
    "if the answer is yes , there should be one set of values for the disk parameters in the following mathematical procedure , and we will try to determine whether our mathematical procedure can be applied to determine the available parameter space . if the answer is no , the following mathematical procedure should be simple and succinct . to give one precise mathematical solution to the question is very difficult .",
    "we consider the question as follows .",
    "the observed double - peaked broad h@xmath0 is re - fitted .",
    "when procedure starts to fit line profile , one of the disk parameters is fixed to one value much different from the accepted value above ( half of the accepted value for the parameter ) , and the other disk parameters with the same starting values in fitting procedure are free .",
    "then the levenberg - marquardt least - squares minimization technique is applied to find the best fitted results for observed double - peaked broad h@xmath0 and find the best solutions for the disk parameters .",
    "actually , the software package mpfit in markwardt idl library ( http://www.physics.wisc.edu/  craigm / idl/ ) is used to perform the least - squares fitting and to find the best solution . in order to clearly compare the fitted results for different disk parameters ,",
    "the value @xmath41 is calculated , where @xmath42 means the best fitted results for accepted disk parameters shown in figure  [ par_dis ] and @xmath43 means the best fitted results for one fixed disk parameter with half of the accepted value for the parameter .",
    "figure  [ unique ] shows the fitted results , and the corresponding values of @xmath41 .",
    "the apparent and large difference ( residual to some extent ) between @xmath43 and @xmath42 indicates that solutions to disk parameters based on accretion disk model are unique to some extent .",
    "thus , in the following mathematical procedure to determine geometrical structure of emission line regions , there are fixed disk parameters .    based on the results above , through the disk parameters , one kind disk - like geometrical structures of blrs of 3c390.3 can be well structured .",
    "then it is very interesting to check whether the characters of observed light - curves can be reproduced through the theoretical disk - like blrs of 3c390.3 , which is the main objective of the following section .",
    "in the section above , one kind geometric structure of blrs of 3c390.3 have been supposed by the theoretical elliptical accretion disk model ( eracleous et al .",
    "1995 ) . in this section",
    ", we will mainly check whether the supposed disk - like blrs are valid to reproduce properties of observed continuum and broad line variability , through reverberation mapping technique .    in order to clearly build one physical geometrical structure of disk - like blrs",
    ", the length of one gravitational radius ( @xmath33 ) in physical unit should be firstly determined , i.e. , it is necessary to determine the masses of central black hole of 3c390.3 . here",
    "the bh masses of 3c390.3 , @xmath44 , is accepted . for 3c390.3 , the two kinds of bh masses , both virial bh masses ( peterson et al . 2004 ) and bh masses from m - sigma relation ( tremaine et al .",
    "2002 , ferrarese & merritt 2001 , gebhardt et al . , 2000 , gltekin et al .",
    "2009 , woo et al .",
    "2010 , lewis & eracleous 2006 ) can be found in literature , which are similar .",
    "thus we do not worry about the accuracy of bh masses of 3c390.3 , and accept @xmath45 based on the bh masses . through the disk parameters",
    "above , it is not difficult to build the physical geometry of the blrs of 3c390.3 supposed by theoretical model",
    ". then it is interesting to check the results based on the reverberation mapping technique through the supposed disk - like blrs as follows .",
    "first and foremost , we accept the assumptions listed in peterson ( 1993 ) for reverberation mapping technique , 1 ) : the continuum emission is from one central source which is much smaller than blrs . the assumption is efficient for 3c390.3 , although double - peaked broad line of 3c390.3 is assumed from accretion disk .",
    "the reported size of blrs of 3c390.3 , the time lag between observed optical balmer emission and observed uv x - ray emission , is about @xmath46 light - days ( dietrich et al . 1998 , bentz et al . 2009 ) , i.e. , @xmath47 , through cross correlation function method . based on the theoretical disk parameters for 3c390.3 , the flux weighted mean size of blrs is about @xmath48 ( simply calculated by @xmath49 , @xmath50 is the line emissivity slope ) .",
    "the result indicates the uv emission region is much near to central black hole , which clearly can be treated as one point source .",
    "2 ) : both continuum emission and line emission are freely and isotopically propagating in the central volume , which can be confirmed by the small covering factor estimated by the appearance of no - absorption features around broad h@xmath0 .",
    "3 ) : the line emissions are in rapid response to ionizing continuum , which can be confirmed by the strong correlation between line luminosity and continuum luminosity found by greene & ho ( 2005 ) and by the much shorter recombination time ( about one hundred seconds for standard blrs ) of balmer emission lines and much longer dynamic time ( about several years for standard blrs ) than the light travel time across blrs , as discussed in peterson ( 1993 ) .",
    "besides , we structure the supposed theoretical structures of blrs of 3c390.3 as follows .",
    "more than @xmath51 tiny clouds ( or so - called test particles , if we treat each tiny cloud with sufficient tiny size ) are set in the n elliptical rings ( the blrs ) , each tiny cloud has its position ( radius @xmath52 and orientation angle @xmath53 ) and line intensity ( @xmath54 ) . the position in one elliptical ring for one tiny cloudy is created by , @xmath55 \\\\ r & = \\frac{r_{\\star}\\times(1+e)}{1-e\\times\\cos(\\phi ) } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 and @xmath9 are the pericenter distance and eccentricity of the disk - like blrs of 3c390.3 , @xmath52 is the distance from the tiny cloud to the central black hole . from inner boundary @xmath7 to outer boundary @xmath8 , the pericenter distance for the elliptical rings is evenly separated into n bins , @xmath57 with step of @xmath58 . because most part of line emission is from inner area of blrs , thus the parameter of logarithm of pericenter distance ( @xmath59 )",
    "is evenly separated , rather than the parameter of pericenter distance ( @xmath52 ) , which provides more areas in inner part of blrs . after that ,",
    "the orientation angle @xmath53 is evenly separated into m bins , @xmath60 with step of @xmath61 . based on the @xmath62 and @xmath63",

    "furthermore , we should note that in our procedure , the listed disk parameters above are taken as fixed values , based on the following considerations . on the one hand , there are tiny variations of line profiles of double - peaked h@xmath0 observed around 1995 .",
    "based on the observed h@xmath0 selected rom agnwatch , it is very difficult to find one reliable correlation between line profile variability and disk parameters ( especially orientation angle @xmath53 ) through theoretical disk model . in other words",

    "if the contributions of narrow emission lines are corrected , the index for the correlation shown in figure  [ conha ] should be steeper than 0.26 and near to 1 .",

    "because of the extended blrs , the delta function is delayed and expanded . light traveling from the central black hole ( we assume that the ionizing photos are from central point ) to the innerest boundary of the blrs is about 5days , from the inner boundary ( @xmath91 ) to the point with longest distance ( @xmath92 , larger than the pericenter distance @xmath93 for the out boundary , because the blrs are elliptical disk - like ) from central black hole is about 39 days . thus in the figure",
    ", it is clear that 5 days after the burst of continuum , the line intensity starts to vary , and then 39 days after the burst of continuum emission , the variation of line intensity ends . because the inner part of blrs emits most of the line intensity of broad h@xmath0 , thus the line intensity of total h@xmath0 is changed from strong to weak with passage of time as shown in the figure .",
    "furthermore , it should be interesting to check the effects of different geometrical structure on the response output broad h@xmath0 , although we have accepted there are fixed and stable disk parameters in section above .",

    "is also shown in figure  [ example ] , it is clear that the response to input continuum described delta function is much different for elliptical disk structure and for circular disk structure . the different response for different geometrical structures indicates the different structures of blrs of agn should be discriminated through the light curves of continuum emission and broad emission lines emission , especially when there are homogeneous and complete information for the light curves .",
    "actually , based on the observed light curves of 3c390.3 selected from agn watch project , there is no way to discriminate different geometrical structures of blrs as what we have shown in the following results .",
    "the results shown in the figure indicate that our procedures above do work , and effects of extended disk - like blrs on light curve of emission line can be clearly described by our procedures .",
    "last but not least , the observed light curve of continuum emission at @xmath99 collected from agn watch is used as the input light curve of continuum emission . the detailed description about the light curve can be found in dietrich et al .",
    "there are 70 data points included in the light curve from mjd2449517 to mjd2450068 .",
    "we first create one new light curve of continuum emission with date separation of 1day by linear interpolation method applied to observed light curve of continuum .",
    "then we check the expected output light curve of broad h@xmath0 under the supposed elliptical disk - like blrs .",
    "the results are shown in bottom - left panel of figure [ obs ] .",
    "it is clear that the expected output light curve of broad h@xmath0 is consistent with the observed light curve of broad h@xmath0 , the linear correlation coefficient for the correlation between output light curve of h@xmath0 and observed light curve of h@xmath0 is about 0.85 with @xmath100 .",
    "then through the input light curve of continuum and the output corresponding light curve of broad h@xmath0 , it is interesting to estimate the size of blrs by so - called cross correlation function ( ccf ) . here , the common interpolated cross - correlation function ( iccf ) ( gaskell & sparke 1986 , gaskell & peterson 1987 , peterson 1993 ) is applied to quantify time lag between continuum emission and broad lines emission .",
    "we do not consider the z - transfer discrete correlation function ( zdcf , alexander 1997 , edelson & krolik 1988 , white & peterson 1994 ) any more , because results from zdcf are excellent agreement with the results from iccf ( peterson et al .",

    ", the corresponding results based on the disk parameters shown in flohic & eracleous ( 2008 ) are also calculated , and shown in figure  [ obs ] .",
    "it is clear that although the example shown in figure  [ example ] indicates the information from light curves can be used to confirm which structure should be more preferred , there is no way to find enough evidence to determine which structure ( elliptical disk - like blrs or circular disk - like blrs ) is preferred , due to the incomplete and in - homogeneous information provided from the observed light curves .",
    "thus , we mainly compare the calculated time lags between continuum emission and broad line emission , under the two structures .",
    "figure [ obs ] shows the ccf results from input light curve of continuum and the output light curve of broad h@xmath0 , the distribution of the size of blrs through bootstrap method ( a common monte - carlo method to estimate the uncertainty of parameter , press et al .",

    "detailed descriptions about ccf method to estimate size of blrs ( time lag between line emission and continuum emission ) and bootstrap method to estimate uncertainties of measured time lag can be found in peterson ( 1993 ) . from the results shown in the figure",

    "we should note that the size of blrs is the distance from broad h@xmath0 emission line region to optical continuum emission region , thus the value is some smaller than @xmath102 estimated by the ccf function from light curve of broad h@xmath0 and light curve of x - ray / uv emission shown in dietrich et al .",

    "however , there is no enough evidence to against the circular disk - like blrs for 3c390.3 , besides the best fitted results for observed line profiles . if there should homogeneous and complete observed light curves , the clear final decision should be given .    in order to further confirm that the disk - like blrs determined by elliptical accretion disk model is reliable for double - peaked emitter 3c390.3",
    ", we also check the ccf results for disk - like blrs with different disk parameters , in spite of the best fitted results for observed double - peaked broad balmer line .",
    "figure  [ par_ccf ] shows the effects of disk parameters on the measured size of blrs through input continuum emission and output h@xmath0 emission based on the elliptical accretion disk model as what we have done above .",
    "it is clear that inner radius and emissivity power are the two main parameters which have apparent effects on the theoretically measured size of blrs of 3c390.3 . in the figure",
    ", we only show the effects from inner radius , emissivity power , eccentricity and inclination angle of disk - like blrs , because there are few effects from the other disk parameters .",
    "certainly , more reliable evidence to determine and confirm model parameters should depend on future more detailed and homogeneous observed light curves of continuum emission and broad line emission .",
    "the results indicate that the measured disk parameters for blrs of 3c390.3 are reliable to some extent , and different geometrical structures of blrs based on different disk parameters should lead to different theoretically measured size of blrs from size of blrs through observational results .",
    "the results above indicate that the elliptical accretion disk model can be applied to best fit the observed spectra , i.e. , the model can provide fine velocity structures for blrs of 3c390.3 .",
    "furthermore , the elliptical accretion disk model can provide fine geometrical structures which can be applied to reproduce characters of observed light curve of broad h@xmath0 .",
    "thus elliptical accretion disk model which can be applied to fit characters of line profiles and variations of broad double - peaked h@xmath0 is appropriate to double - peaked emitter 3c390.3 .",
    "as one well - known double - peaked emitter , based on the disk parameters measured above , to check the expected line profile of double - peaked broad balmer emission line of 3c390.3 in different years / periods is very interesting . although the more recent observed line profiles of double - peaked broad h@xmath0 of 3c390.3 in jan .",

    "the relativistic precession period of the elliptical disk - like blrs around central black hole of 3c390.3 can be simply calculated ( weinberg 1972 ) , @xmath104 where a is the semi - major axis length and @xmath9 is the eccentricity . although , the precession period for outer elliptical rings is very long , the short precession period for inner elliptical rings should lead to some apparent variations of double - peaked broad emission lines from 1995 to 2000 .",
    "we simply assume that orientation angle is the unique parameter to vary from 1995 to 2000 in the elliptical accretion disk model .",
    "as what we have done in section 3 , the elliptical disk - like blrs are separated into 60 rings .",
    "it is clear that orientation angle of each ring in 2000 should be some different due to different semi - major axis length for each ring , @xmath105 , where @xmath106 means the rotating direction of disk - like blrs is clockwise or anticlockwise for observer .",
    "after the orientation angles of the 60 rings around 2000 are determined , line profile expected in 2000 can be re - constructed by the sum of 60 expected double - peaked components from 60 rings , as what we have done in section 3 . here",
    "the theoretical line profile in 2000 is mainly based on the mean spectrum around 1995 in agn watch project .",
    "the mean observed spectrum shown as thin solid line in figure  [ 2000 ] is created by pca ( principal components analysis , so - called karhunen - loeve transform ) method applied for all the 66 observed spectra of broad h@xmath0 around 1995 .",
    "the convenient and public idl pca program pca_solve.pro written by d. schlegel in princeton university is used , which is included in the sdss software package of idlspec2d ( http://spectro.princeton.edu/ ) .",
    "commonly , the first principal component represents the mean spectrum . from the mean spectrum ,",
    "it is clear that there are similar flux ratio ( @xmath107 ) of blue peak to red peak of broad double - peaked h@xmath0 and similar flux ratio ( @xmath89 ) of blue part to red part with those mean values shown in figure  [ var ] .",
    "figure [ 2000 ] shows the probable observed line profile of broad double - peaked h@xmath0 of 3c390.3 around 2000 , and shows the comparison between the mean observed spectrum around 1995 and observed spectrum around 2000 .",
    "based on the theoretical accretion disk model , through the results shown in top - left panel in figure  [ 2000 ] , we can find that due to precession period , after about 5 years , the flux ratio of red peak to blue peak should be changed . in the figure ,",
    "flux density at blue peaks of all the line profiles have been normalized to 1 .",
    "if rotating direction of disk - like blrs is clockwise to observer , the expected flux ratio ( 1.36 ) of red peak to blue peak of spectrum around 2000 should be smaller than the one ( 1.46 ) of observed spectrum around 1995 .",
    "if rotating direction of disk - like blrs is anticlockwise to observer , the expected flux ratio ( 1.68 ) in 2000 should be larger than the one ( 1.46 ) in 1995 . through the observed spectrum in 2000 ,",
    "the flux ratio of blue peak to red peak is about @xmath108 .",
    "thus , if anticlockwise rotating disk - like blrs are applied for 3c390.3 , the variations in observed spectra in different years can be naturally explained , although the applied model is over - simplified .",
    "the some larger value 1.79 than theoretical expected 1.68 are perhaps due to the not so accurate precession period , the probable existence of varying of hot spots and/or warped structures , different local broadening velocity ( which should lead the part around red peak to be some flat ) , etc .. the not so consistent red peak positions for spectrum around 2000 and mean spectrum around 1995 is probable due to the variation of emissivity power slope during the 5 years from 1995 to 2000 .    finally , a simple summary is listed as follows .",
    "based on the observed spectra around 1995 for 3c390.3 , the elliptical accretion disk model is applied to fit the observed double - peaked broad h@xmath0 collected from agn watch project .",
    "then based on the disk parameters , the formed geometrical structures of blrs of 3c390.3 are applied to check the reverberation mapping results for 3c390.3 . the disk - like blrs supposed by theoretical elliptical accretion disk model can well re - produce the observational results about reverberation mapping technique .",
    "thus the disk - like blrs are preferred for 3c390.3 .",
    "furthermore , we check the effects of precession of elliptical disk - like blrs on the observed line profile . after about 5 years , the line profile of broad double - peaked h@xmath0 observed in 2000 by hst can be well expected by the theoretical elliptical accretion disk model , based on the disk parameters measured through spectra observed around 1995 , which confirms the elliptical accretion disk model is appropriate to double - peaked emitter 3c390.3 .",

    "<S> in this manuscript , the structure of broad emission line regions ( blrs ) of well - mapping double - peaked emitter ( agn with broad double - peaked low - ionization emission lines ) 3c390.3 is studied . </S>",
    "<S> besides the best fitted results for double - peaked broad optical balmer lines of 3c390.3 by theoretical disk model , we try to find another way to further confirm the origination of double - peaked line from accretion disk . </S>",
    "<S> based on the long - period observed spectra in optical band around 1995 collected from agn watch project , the theoretical disk parameters of disk - like blrs supposed by elliptical accretion disk model ( eracleous et al . </S>",
    "<S> 1995 ) have been well determined . through the theoretical disk - like blrs , </S>",
    "<S> characters of observed light - curves of broad double - peaked h@xmath0 of 3c390.3 can be well reproduced based on the reverberation mapping technique . </S>",
    "<S> thus the accretion disk model is preferred as one better model for blrs of 3c390.3 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we can find that different disk parameters should lead to some different results about size of blrs of 3c390.3 from the one measured through observational data , which indicates the measured disk parameters are significantly valid for 3c390.3 . </S>",
    "<S> after that , the precession of theoretical elliptical disk - like blrs being considered , we can find that the expected line profile in 2000 by theoretical model is consistent with the observed line profile by hst around 2000 . </S>",
    "<S> based on the results , we can further believe that the origination of broad double - peaked balmer emission lines of 3c390.3 are from accretion disk around central black hole .    </S>",
