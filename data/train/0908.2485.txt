    "exciting progress in experiments with cold atoms in optical lattices @xcite has not only paved the way for study of the quantum phases associated with strongly interacting many - body systems @xcite , but also for study of non - equilibrium dynamics in such systems .",
    "this is particularly true for transport properties , where the long coherence times associated with the experiments make it possible to gain new insight into phenomena such as spin - charge separation @xcite , and currents in the presence of impurities and junctions @xcite by studying them in a new environment . particularly in the case of 1d systems , this connection to non - equilibrium dynamics is further strengthened by the recent development of numerical methods based on matrix product states @xcite , including the time evolving block decimation ( tebd ) algorithm @xcite and the related time - dependent density matrix renormalisation group ( t - dmrg ) methods @xcite .",
    "these make possible the quantitative prediction of time - dependent dynamics for size scales that are typical in experiments , as well as the identification of parameter regimes in which specific phenomena can be observed .",
    "a key characteristic for the transport of bosons in a lattice is the stability of currents in the presence of interactions which can arise in regimes where the system is superfluid .",
    "however , this stability depends not only on the current and the interactions @xcite , but also on the dimensionality of the system .",
    "this was demonstrated in recent experiments by observing damping of the centre of mass motion for bosons oscillating in an harmonic trap @xcite .",
    "for sufficiently small initial displacements , the motion was found to be stable up to a critical lattice depth in higher dimensions , whilst for bosons confined to move along one dimension , decay of the oscillatory motion was observed for arbitrarily small depth .",
    "this was explained by the increased role of quantum fluctuations in the 1d system @xcite .",
    "a similar situation occurs in the case where a homogeneous current is created , e.g. , by starting in the lowest energy state , and then accelerating the lattice @xcite ( as shown in figure  [ fig : sketch ] ) .",
    "a mean - field stability diagram as a function of the magnitude of the acceleration and the strength of inter - particle interactions was computed by altman et al .",
    "@xcite , predicting a sharp transition between stable and unstable regions . for bosons confined in 3d ,",
    "such transitions were observed recently @xcite .",
    "however , the same experiments indicated strong deviations from this behaviour with a 1d gas , for which a crossover was observed between the two regimes .",
    "bosons in the ground state configuration in an optical lattice are instantaneously accelerated to a mean quasi - momentum in the lowest bloch band .",
    "the stability of the resulting current will depend on the value of this quasi - momentum and the inter - particle interactions.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    here we perform a detailed numerical analysis of the decay of currents for a bose gas moving uniformly in 1d , making quantitative predictions for the time - dependence of currents that can be measured in an experiment . this analysis is made possible via the use of the infinite tebd ( itebd ) algorithm @xcite , which until now has primarily been applied to study the ground states of homogeneous systems .",
    "here it is used to investigate the time - dependence of homogeneous current flow , allowing predictions to be made over longer timescales without boundary effects .",
    "we begin from the ground state of the bose - hubbard model @xcite , which describes the lattice gas , and consider an acceleration applied in order to produce a finite current . as a function of the interaction strength in the gas and the magnitude of the acceleration , we observe a broad crossover between regions of stable and unstable current , which we characterise via the variation in the rate of decay of the current for different parameters .",
    "we find that the crossover region occurs at significantly smaller values of interaction strength and initial acceleration than are predicted by mean - field methods .",
    "we also compare our decay rates to those obtained for systems with large filling factors via phase - slip calculations by polkovnikov et al .  @xcite .",
    "the rest of this paper is organised as follows : in section  [ sec : system ] we discuss the bose - hubbard model for the system we study , and the methods we use to characterise the currents in the system . in section  [ sec : numprod ] we describe the use of the itebd algorithm and the procedure we use in our calculations . in section  [ sec : currentresults ] we present a quantitative analysis of the decay of currents within the system , as well as the dependence of the decay on the initial acceleration and the inter - particle interactions .",
    "the scaling properties of the decay rates are investigated in section  [ sec : phaseslip ] , and compared to calculations based on phase - slip methods , and in section  [ sec : summary ] we give a summary and outlook for this work .",
    "[ app : blockconv ] provides detailed information about translationally invariant block sizes within the itebd algorithm .",
    "in this section we introduce the system of bosons moving in 1d in an optical lattice .",
    "we first introduce the hamiltonian describing the system in [ sec : bose - hubbard - model ] , before discussing the current and general expectations for its stability during time evolution in [ sec : curr - bose - hubb ] . in order to make stronger connections to quantities that can be measured in an experiment",
    ", we introduce the quasi - condensate fraction in [ sec : quasi - cond - fract ] , the decay of which is strongly related to the decay of the current .",
    "the dynamics of bosons in the lowest band of an optical lattice is described by the bose - hubbard model @xcite with hamiltonian ( @xmath0 ) : @xmath1 here , @xmath2 ( @xmath3 )",
    "are the bosonic annihilation ( creation ) operators at lattice site @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the on - site interaction energy shift , and @xmath7 is the tunnelling amplitude between neighbouring sites , with @xmath8 denoting a sum over neighbouring lattice sites .",
    "this model is valid in the regime where @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the energy separation between the lowest two bloch bands , and we denote the filling factor of @xmath11 particles on @xmath12 lattice sites as @xmath13 .    for integer @xmath14 , a phase transition",
    "is observed in the ground state of this model as a function of @xmath15 between superfluid and insulating behaviour @xcite . in one dimension with @xmath16 , the critical value of @xmath17 is @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the superfluid ( sf ) ground state is characterised by quasi off - diagonal long range order in the single particle density matrix ( spdm ) @xmath19 . for @xmath20 ,",
    "the system is in a mott insulator ( mi ) phase , with exponentially decaying off - diagonal elements of the spdm @xmath21 . in what follows below",
    ", we will assume that the system is prepared in the ground state of the bose - hubbard model for a particular choice of @xmath14 and @xmath17 , and then accelerated to produce a finite initial current .      by accelerating the lattice or applying a linear gradient potential for a short period of time , it is possible to create a current of atoms moving with respect to the optical lattice .",
    "this can be quantified via the current operator @xmath22 which appears in the continuity equation @xmath23 note that the average of the current expectation values @xmath24 is proportional to the mean group velocity calculated via the quasi - momentum distribution of the particles . in particular",
    ", we can define bosonic operators for the quasi - momentum modes , @xmath25 , which are related to @xmath2 as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the lattice spacing , and @xmath28 for @xmath29 $ ] an integer , with @xmath30 the lattice length .",
    "we see that @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the quasi - momentum distribution function at quasi - momentum @xmath33 , for which the corresponding group velocity per lattice constant is given by @xmath34 . in this study",
    ", the current will always be translationally invariant , and so we omit the site label and write @xmath35 , for any @xmath36 .    if a finite current is induced to the system by accelerating the lattice so that the quasi - momentum distribution is shifted by an amount @xmath37 ( see figure  [ fig : sketch ] )",
    ", then we expect the resulting behaviour to depend on the superfluidity of the gas . even in the presence of interactions ,",
    "a superfluid flow without dissipation can exist .",
    "however , if a current is generated in a non - superfluid initial state , or if the flow becomes dynamically unstable , then the current will decay . whether the current is stable or not is thus a function of both the initial state of the system and the initial mean quasi - momentum , @xmath37 @xcite .    as has been predicted theoretically in the weakly interacting gross - pitaevskii regime @xcite and demonstrated in experiments @xcite , the current will be unstable if the initial superfluid ground state ( with all atoms near @xmath38 ) is accelerated to the inverted part of the lowest bloch band , i.e. , when @xmath39 ( this corresponds to a classical instability ) .",
    "we thus expect stable currents only when @xmath40 .",
    "if we begin with the ground state of a system with integer filling @xmath41 , then we also do not expect stable superfluid currents above the critical interaction @xmath42 for the sf - mi phase transition .",
    "a stability diagram , interpolating between these two regimes was investigated by altman et al",
    ".  @xcite using a gutzwiller mean - field technique , and they found a sharp transition between stable and unstable regions .",
    "this sharp transition was observed in an experiment by mun et al .",
    "@xcite for bosons allowed to move in the lattice in three dimensions . however , the same experiment observed behaviour more characteristic of a crossover between stable and unstable currents in 1d .    in this sense , in a 1d system",
    "it is not possible to characterise clear regions where the currents decay and do not decay , but rather the crossover must be characterised by how rapidly the current decays for different initial mean quasi - momenta and inter - particle interaction strengths . in section  [ sec : currentresults ]",
    "we will investigate this crossover quantitatively in terms of such decay rates using the itebd algorithm .      in section  [ sec : currentresults ]",
    "we show that the decay of the current results from two - particle scattering processes that broaden the quasi - momentum distribution . in 2d or 3d decay of the current",
    "is thus also directly linked to a decrease in the condensate fraction in the experiment , which was used as the key experimental observable in reference  @xcite . in 1d , there is no condensate for an infinite system , however as the system is finite ( of the order of 100 occupied lattice sites ) , a peak that would correspond to the condensate is observed in time of flight measurements of the momentum distribution . in order to make connection to this observable , we will calculate not only the time dependence of the current @xmath43 below , but also a _ quasi - condensate _ fraction defined over a finite portion of the system .",
    "this fraction , @xmath44 , can be defined as the largest eigenvalue of the reduced spdm considering only a range of @xmath45 sites in the system i.e. @xmath46 , with @xmath47 $ ] for some arbitrary site @xmath48 .",
    "we typically use @xmath49 below , reflecting the typical occupied number of lattice sites in experiments .",
    "in the remainder of this manuscript , we analyse the decay of a current , which is created by suddenly imparting a quasi - momentum @xmath37 at time @xmath50 to bosons loaded into the lattice in the ground state configuration ( which has zero mean quasi - momentum ) .",
    "this resembles the experimental situation of reference  @xcite , where a current is obtained by means of a moving optical lattice which is accelerated to a final quasi - momentum @xmath37 on a timescale long enough to ensure adiabaticity with the respect to inter - band transitions .",
    "here we assume that the acceleration is fast compared with the tunnelling timescale @xmath51 , resulting in a simple translation of the quasi - momentum distribution , ( see section  [ sec : initial - current ] and figure  [ fig : mdfshift ] ) .",
    "this corresponds to an application of the operator @xmath52 to the initial ground state .    to compute both",
    "the initial ground state of the system , and the time dependence of the current once the initial mean quasi - momentum @xmath37 is imparted on the system , we make use of the itebd algorithm @xcite . this algorithm is an extension of the tebd algorithm @xcite , and makes possible the near - exact integration of the schrdinger equation for 1d lattice hamiltonians in an infinite , translationally invariant system .",
    "these methods have not only been applied to coherent dynamics in 1d , but also generalised to dissipative systems @xcite , and extensions to a 2d state ansatz have been recently considered @xcite .    until now",
    ", itebd has been primarily used to compute the ground state of translationally invariant systems , however here this algorithm becomes crucial in computing time - dependent dynamics . by computing the decay of the current in an effectively infinite system , we avoid difficulties arising due to either open boundary conditions , which can prevent propagation of moving bosons , and periodic boundary conditions , which restrict the length over which correlation functions can be computed . in our calculations",
    "we apply the itebd algorithm as described in reference  @xcite , but with the modification that the length of a single block in the translationally invariant system is increased from two to @xmath53 .",
    "although a matrix product state representation can reproduce phase relationships with any period , even with a single repeated matrix , we find it convenient to increase the block size so as to represent one full cycle of the phase when we apply the operator @xmath54 to the state ( see [ app : blockconv ] for more details ) .    throughout our calculations",
    ", we performed convergence tests in the matrix product state bond - dimension @xmath55 , as well as the time step for integration , and the maximum number of particles allowed per site in our description of the hilbert space , @xmath56 . for a more detailed analysis of how errors enter this method ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "in this section we characterise the current and its decay as a function of the initial mean quasi - momentum @xmath37 and the strength of interactions @xmath17 , as well as the evolution of the characteristics of the state as a function of time .",
    "we begin in section  [ sec : initial - current ] by analysing the initial state of the system at a time @xmath57 , after the instantaneous acceleration of the lattice results in a mean initial quasi - momentum @xmath37 . in section  [ sec : evol - char - state ] we then describe the dynamical changes in the quasi - momentum distribution during time evolution .",
    "finally , we discuss the dependence of the decay on @xmath37 and @xmath17 and provide a shaded plot of a stability crossover diagram in section  [ subsec : parameterdep ] .",
    "in this subsection we characterise the system configuration at a time @xmath57 immediately following the initial instantaneous acceleration ( corresponding to an imposition of the initial mean quasi - momentum @xmath37 ) .",
    "we consider both the quasi - momentum distribution @xmath58 and the corresponding current @xmath59 .",
    "normalised quasi - momentum distributions before ( @xmath60 ) and after ( @xmath57 ) a momentum @xmath61 is imparted on the particles .",
    "the solid lines show the distributions for an inter - particle interaction of @xmath62 ( sf regime ) , the dotted lines are for distributions with @xmath63 ( mi regime ) .",

    "the shift @xmath37 is applied instantaneously , and the shape of @xmath58 is unaltered at time @xmath57 .",
    "this latter distribution is the initial condition for the subsequent analysis of the system dynamics .",

    "the current @xmath75 at @xmath57 is @xmath76 , corresponding to all particles occupying the same quasi - momentum state . in a mi state with integer @xmath14 , this current will be zero in the limit of infinitely strong interactions , as the quasi - momentum distribution @xmath58 becomes flat . in figure",
    "[ fig : initcurrent ] the case with @xmath77 is plotted as a solid black line .",
    "the figure shows that for finite values of the interaction strength @xmath17 from figure  [ fig : mdfshift ] , @xmath59 decreases from the value @xmath78 as expected .",
    "however , we note that the current is comparatively large even for the initial condition @xmath63 , corresponding to a mi state at @xmath60 .",
    "this is related to the fact that the quasi - momentum distribution @xmath58 , whilst broader than in the superfluid case , is still finite in width ( see figure  [ fig : mdfshift ] ) , and far from the flat distribution corresponding to the limit @xmath79 . as @xmath17 is increased , the distribution continues to broaden gradually , but there is no strong qualitative change in the initial quasi - momentum distribution or the initial current values on entering the mott insulator regime .      due to the lack of galilean invariance in a lattice , a state with a finite current",
    "does not correspond to an eigenstate of the system .",
    "we expect that in the presence of interactions any initial current @xmath75 will eventually decay to a current - free state .",
    "the dynamics of the current decay corresponds to the rearrangement of the quasi - momentum distribution by two - atom scattering processes .",
    "the quasi - momentum of two particles is always conserved in these scattering processes , but because of umklapp processes that connect the two edges of the brillouin zone , the mean quasi - momentum is significantly changed , and will reach zero in a final steady state .    in figure",

    "we have checked that the off - diagonal elements of the spdm decay exponentially in the final state .",

    "this is very different from the parameter regimes that are typical when the 1d system is formed via a 3d optical lattice , as we study here in the present article . in principle , our filling factors @xmath142 , and acceleration values @xmath143 , do not correpond to the region of validity of equation  ( [ eqn : tunnelingaction ] ) . however , as we will see below , we nonetheless obtain very similar scalings .     the negative logarithm of the decay rate of @xmath85 in panel ( a ) , and of the boson current in panel ( b ) as a function of @xmath144 for a fixed initial mean momentum @xmath145 .",
    "the results are estimated from linear decay rate fits .",
    "both panels visualise a similar linear dependence ( see text ) .",
    "the numerical parameters are @xmath146 , @xmath147.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    figures  [ fig : actionscaling](a ) and [ fig : actionscaling](b ) show our results for the decay rates @xmath120 and @xmath130 , respectively , where @xmath130 has been extracted from the time evolution of the boson current @xmath59 ( see figure  [ fig : decay ] ) in the same way as for @xmath120 as described in section  [ subsec : parameterdep ] . in panels ( a ) and ( b ) we plot @xmath148 and @xmath149 respectively as a function of @xmath144 , for @xmath150 and a fixed @xmath145 . both of these plots show an approximately linear dependence on @xmath151 , for all @xmath14 and @xmath152 . in addition , for these values of @xmath153 both panels show that by increasing @xmath14 the slope of the lines tend to converge to a fixed value .",
    "this indicates that not only is the decay rate proportional to @xmath154 , but that the constant @xmath155 appears to scale as @xmath156 for @xmath157 .",
    "this is the same scaling as predicted for the case @xmath129 via instanton methods .",
    "averaging over the slopes of the results for the large filling factors @xmath158 and @xmath68 , in order to obtain the prefactor in @xmath155 , we find values of @xmath159 and @xmath160 for panels ( a ) and ( b ) respectively .",
    "we note that the equality of the slopes obtained from the current decay and condensate fraction decay within the fitting error indicates the equivalence of these quantities as good dynamical observables , for the characterisation of the current decay both in the numerical simulations and in experiments , for large enough @xmath14 . for small @xmath161",
    "we observe slightly different behaviour ( see below for more details ) .",
    "the results above for large @xmath14 surprisingly show good agreement with scalings from the instanton calculations for a very different parameter regime , although we note that the prefactor in @xmath155 is different , as the scaling law in equation  ( [ eqn : tunnelingaction ] ) , would imply @xmath162 .",
    "the most obvious deviation between the itebd results and equation  ( [ eqn : tunnelingaction ] ) takes place for the @xmath120 results of panel ( a ) in the vicinity of the sf - mi transition with @xmath67 , which occurs at @xmath163 .",
    "for @xmath164 the rate @xmath120 no longer increases as @xmath165 decreases .",
    "we indicate this parameter region with an arrow in figure  [ fig : actionscaling](a ) .",
    "this behaviour is not captured by the decay of the current @xmath130 in panel ( b ) .",
    "this contrast between the the decay of the condensate fraction and the decay of the current could reflect a reduced role of the condensate fraction in the overall system dynamics when we have an initial mi state .",
    "note that for @xmath166 the decay of @xmath43 occurs rapidly on the timescale of our calculation time steps , which makes computing its decay rate less accurate in this regime .",
    "in summary , the itebd method allows us to make quantitative predictions for the time - dependence of currents for bosons moving in 1d in an optical lattice .",
    "in contrast to the behaviour in higher dimensions , we observe a broad crossover between regions of stable and unstable currents , with the typical decay rates for the currents being more rapid than mean - field predictions .",
    "we also find surprising agreement with the scaling of decay rates with interaction strength and filling fraction calculated for the case of large fillings and weak interactions via phase - slip methods .",
    "these results should be accessible in current experiments with filling factors near unit density . as the density increases , we find that the scaling of the decay rate of the current almost agrees with predictions from instanton calculations .",
    "these results are strongly related to the decay of currents generated in a displaced harmonic trap , which has also been the subject of significant experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite investigation .",
    "an understanding of these currents is also an important starting point for the investigation of more general transport properties of bosons in 1d .",
    "this could include behaviour of these currents in the presence of an impurity @xcite , or spatially varying interactions @xcite .",
    "we thank d. jaksch , s. clark , e. demler and p. zoller for helpful discussions .",
    "this work was supported by the austrian science foundation ( fwf ) through sfb f40 foqus and project i118_n16 ( euroquam_dqs ) , the darpa ole program , strep fp7-ict-2007-c project name - quam , and the austrian ministry of science bmwf as part of the uniinfrastrukturprogramm of the forschungsplattform scientific computing and of the centre for quantum physics at lfu innsbruck .",
    "the original itebd algorithm as introduced in @xcite uses translationally invariant matrix product states to represent the quantum state of an infinite homogenous system . in order to conveniently compute time - evolution , the translationally invariant state",
    "is usually represented by a repeated block of two sites , as described in reference @xcite .     the time evolution of @xmath85 after an initial quasi - momentum acceleration @xmath145 for two different on - site interactions @xmath62 and @xmath167 .",
    "no differences are visible when doubling or tripleing the block size @xmath168 within the itebd algoritm .",
    "other numerical parameters are @xmath64 , @xmath65.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    note that despite the block size of two , excitations with any period can be represented in this form , because matrix product states effectively store phase relationships between neighbouring sites rather than phases corresponding to a single site .",
    "indeed , the use of a block size of two is a matter of convenience in applying the algorithm , and if variational methods are applied @xcite , then a block size of one can be sufficient to represent a translationally invariant state . in the present work , we find it convenient to extend the block size beyond two to @xmath168 sites , where for a particular simulation in which the momentum translation of the initial state is @xmath37 , we choose @xmath169 .",
    "this is convenient in the application of the operator @xmath54 , but has no fundamental effects on the computation of time evolution of the state . in our case ,",
    "time evolution is simulated by decomposing the time evolution operator into @xmath168 two - site unitary operations , instead of two as in the original itebd algorithm .",
    "we expect that this , in case of a large enough bond dimension @xmath55 still results in an exact state representation for the infinite system during the whole time evolution .    to demonstrate the independence of the computation of time evolution on our choice of @xmath168 , we plot example values for the time evolution of the condensate fraction @xmath85 , computed with increasing @xmath168 in figure  [ fig : blockconv ] .",
    "we use an initial acceleration @xmath145 , and compare results for block sizes @xmath170 , for two different values of the interaction strength @xmath171 .",
    "we see that the results are independent of the block size , and after testing for convergence in the parametes @xmath55 and @xmath56 should represent exact time - evolved values ."
