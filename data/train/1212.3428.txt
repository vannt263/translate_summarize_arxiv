    "since the high @xmath0 superconductor and quantum hall effect were discovered in 1980s , more and more systems which disobey the landau fermi liquid theory have been springing up .",
    "it is known that the landau fermi liquid theory is not valid for one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems and strongly correlated 2d liquids  @xcite .",
    "khodel et al .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that a state with the fermion condensation or multi - connected momentum distribution arises as the stability condition is broken and accordingly the ground state is rearranged .",
    "when the ground - state rearrangement occurs , systems can possess novel properties that are characteristic of a non - fermi - liquid behavior .",
    "such a rearrangement can also occur in nuclear ground states  @xcite , and can have possible implications in astrophysical issues .",
    "for instance , the direct urca process may be remodelled when the rearrangement occurs , so that the fast cooling of neutron stars is probable  @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we consider two extreme examples that may undergo a ground - state rearrangement due to repulsive interactions .",
    "one is that the fermi liquid system with the weak repulsion provided by the vector boson exchanges .",
    "this may has a correspondence to the aggregation of weakly interacting massive particles in compact stars .",
    "in addition , it could exist the fifth force whose strength is certainly very weak  @xcite . at least , this possibility has not been excluded completely .",
    "recently , considering this in terms of the exchange of the u - boson , a few groups found that the u - boson that couples with nucleons weakly can have a significant effect on properties of neutron stars  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to examine whether the weak coupling can also cause the ground - state rearrangement in specific systems .",
    "one may expect that the rearrangement could have observable effects that may possibly be used to constrain the new force .",
    "another example regards the furious deceleration in the relativistic heavy - ion collisions in the time scale of the typical strong interaction .",
    "according to the equivalence principle of the general relativity , the deceleration or acceleration is identical to a local gravitational field .",
    "as the usual particle statistics neglects the space - time character , its consideration is of special interest and significance  @xcite .",
    "the present investigation serves the purpose to mimic fermion rearrangements in strongly curved space that exist during spectacular supernova explosions and in the horizon of a black hole .",
    "we will focus on determining the conditions of the occurrence of the ground - state rearrangement in these two scenarios .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the stability condition of ground states together with the ground - state rearrangement is demonstrated for fermi liquids .",
    "the numerical results are presented in sec .",
    "finally , the summary is given .",
    "the ground - state stability condition can be established on the fact that the variation of the ground state energy is positive for any admissible variations of distribution .",
    "namely , the excitation states have higher energy than the ground state , which means that @xmath1\\delta n(\\textbf{k})\\frac{d^{3}\\textbf{k}}{(2\\pi)^{3 } } ,   \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] is positive when the conservative condition for the particle number is satisfied : @xmath2  @xcite , where @xmath3 is the single - particle energy and @xmath4 is the chemical potential .",
    "the landau fermi liquid theory tells us that the ground - state distribution of a homogeneous fermi liquid is a fermi - step function @xmath5 with @xmath6 being the fermi momentum .",
    "namely , the states are filled below the fermi momentum and are empty above it .",
    "the stability condition is satisfied if the single - particle energy above the fermi surface is larger than that below it .",
    "otherwise , it is violated .",
    "that is to say , @xmath7 needs to be positive for the whole momentum range . in deed , @xmath8 is the chemical potential @xmath4 when the temperature @xmath9 . as @xmath10 ,",
    "the ground state of landau fermi liquid theory becomes unstable provided that @xmath11 is negative or zero in the vicinity of the fermi momentum . in this case , the mass of quasi - particles @xmath12 is consistently negative or infinity once the value of the group velocity @xmath13 ) .    in a word",
    ", we obtain a necessary stability condition for the landau fermi liquid theory : @xmath11 has to be positive near @xmath6 ( in this paper we define the interval @xmath14 as the nearby @xmath6 to examine the stability condition ) .    with the breaking of stability condition",
    ", the ground state can only be reconstructed by means of the rearrangement . in fig .",
    "[ rearr ] , we show as an example the reconstructed ground - state distribution after the rearrangement .          the first example that concerns the ground - state rearrangement",
    "is realized by the addition of repulsion with the exchange of the vector boson .",
    "the addition of repulsion may be supposed in strongly interacting nuclear matter or in weakly interacting dark matter .",
    "we can examine the system stability by analyzing its energy spectrum as above . in the relativistic hartree - fock ( rhf )",
    "approximation , the energy momentum distribution is given as @xmath15\\\\ & & + \\frac{{\\gamma}g_{v}^{2}}{2\\pi^{2}m_{v}^{2}}\\int_{0}^{\\infty } p^{2}n(p)dp+\\frac{g_{v}^{2}}{8\\pi^{2}k}\\int_{0}^{\\infty}pn(p)\\ln\\frac{(k+p)^{2}+m_{v}^{2}}{(k - p)^{2 } + m_{v}^{2}}dp \\label{eq5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the fermion effective mass which is density dependent and moderately model - dependent , @xmath17 is the mass of the vector boson of interest ( e.g. , the u boson  @xcite ) , @xmath18 is the degree of degeneracy which is 4 with the spin and isospin considered , @xmath19 is the boson - fermion coupling constant , and @xmath20 for the @xmath21 and @xmath22 meson , respectively .",
    "the terms in square brackets represent the contribution of the vector mesons @xmath21 and @xmath22 in symmetric nuclear matter . in eq.([eq5 ] ) , besides the usual vector mesons @xmath21 and @xmath22 in the relativistic nuclear models , we have included the additional vector boson ( denoted by the subscript @xmath23 ) in the original model to provide the additional repulsion that may result in a limited modification to the nucleon effective mass .",

    ", the momentum distribution of the ground state deviates from the step function once @xmath26 in the vicinity of the fermi surface .",
    "when the coupling constant @xmath19 is larger than some critical value @xmath27 , the zero point of @xmath11 will appear near @xmath6 . by numerical integration , we can search the zero point for @xmath11 in the interval @xmath28 , and the minimum @xmath19 for possessing at least one zero point is the critical coupling constant @xmath27 .",
    "it is well - known that the local effect of gravity on a physical system is identical with the effect of linear acceleration of the system according to einstein s equivalence principle , and vice versa . in accelerated systems , the hamiltonian comprises a term provided by the non - inertial effect @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the acceleration of the system , @xmath31 is the velocity of light ( equal to 1 in the natural unit ) , @xmath32 is the mass of particle ( usually the effective mass @xmath16 is used instead ) , z is the particle s coordinate along the direction of acceleration of the reference frame ( in the case of collision , z equals to half the distance between colliding particles , i.e. @xmath33 in the center of mass reference frame )  @xcite .    the non - inertial contribution in eq.([eq2 ] ) has a form of the harmonic oscillator . in the green function method or feynman diagrammatic",
    "approach , an explicit expression of the propagator of the harmonic oscillator is mathematically complicated , and the numerics seems to be not straightforward  @xcite . in order to simplify this tedious issue",
    ", we suppose that the repulsive force decelerating the particles during collision is provided by a postulated vector meson exchange through a well - known yukawa coupling . at the same time",
    ", we assume that the step function distributions are applied to systems prior to the collision .",
    "the non - inertial effect can then be described by the vector meson exchange between nucleons which is sophisticatedly applied in modern physics . instead of the given non - inertial effect term",
    ", we can use yukawa potential @xmath34 , i.e. , we let @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is a dimensionless coupling constant,@xmath37 is the mass of the postulated meson ( generally in the same order of magnitude with nucleon mass ) , @xmath38 is the distance between nucleons .",
    "the propagator of yukawa potential is very simple : @xmath39 .",
    "the single - particle energy for colliding systems can be expressed as @xmath40\\nonumber\\\\   & & + \\int\\frac{g^{2}}{(\\textbf{k - p})^{2 } + m^{2}_v}n(\\textbf{p})\\frac{d^{3}\\textbf{p}}{(2\\pi)^{3 } } , \\label{eq3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the direct hartree terms are neglected because they do not contribute to the momentum derivative that is used to determine the critical coupling constant . here ,",
    "we quote the same coefficient @xmath41 as in eq.([eq5 ] ) by assuming the symmetric matter after the collision .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption to neglect the effect of isospin asymmetry because the coupling strength of the @xmath22 meson is much less than that of the @xmath21 meson and the isospin asymmetry is usually not large for the colliding system .",
    "after some straightforward calculations , one can find that the derivative @xmath11 is exactly the same as eq.([eq4 ] ) , provided @xmath19 and @xmath27 are replaced by @xmath36 and @xmath42 , respectively . with the given quantities @xmath16 and @xmath37 at the density @xmath22 , we adjust the coupling constant @xmath36 to exceed some critical value @xmath42 where @xmath11 has the zero point in the vicinity of the fermi surface",
    ". then we can find out the critical coupling constant for the ground - state rearrangement .",
    "to obtain the fermion distribution function , one needs first to solve the single - particle energy @xmath43 .",
    "once the rearrangement occurs , the fermion distribution function becomes multi - connected and the numerical realization is quite tricky due to the existence of sharp edges .",
    "we do not elaborate the numerical details , and readers can be referred to ref .",
    "@xcite for details . in the following ,",
    "we discuss in turn the occurrence of ground - state rearrangement in cases of the vector boson exchanges and relativistic heavy - ion collisions .      here",
    "we first work on the relativistic model slc  @xcite .",
    "the additional vector boson is added to this model to provide additional repulsion , and the nucleon effective mass is obtained in the rhf approximation  @xcite . with the density - dependent nucleon effective mass , we are able to investigate the rearrangement self - consistently at various densities . in",
    "what follows , we will discuss the rearrangement in a simple system that consists of dark matter in which the fermion mass is taken as a free parameter by assuming that the dark matter is just weakly interacting . in this case , we intend to see whether the rearrangement can occur with the weak repulsion .        after obtaining the nucleon effective mass in the rhf approximation",
    ", we can calculate the critical coupling constant for the ground - state rearrangement . in fig .",
    "[ gc - rho ] , the critical coupling constant is plotted as a function of density for various choices of the vector boson mass : @xmath44 and @xmath45 . as one can see from fig .",
    "[ gc - rho ] , the critical coupling constant @xmath27 ascends monotonically with increasing the density when @xmath17 is relative small ( @xmath46 ) , while for the large mass ( @xmath47 ) , @xmath27 increases fast in the subsaturation density region , then goes down slowly with the successive increase of the density .",
    "in all cases , the critical coupling constant saturates at high densities .",
    "recently , the vector boson beyond the standard model , dubbed the u - boson that may accounts for the modification to the inverse square law of the newtonian gravity , has been introduced to compensate the excessively small pressure suggested by the super - soft symmetry energy  @xcite . the super - soft equation of state ( eos ) can be successfully remedied by the repulsion provided by the u - boson with the ratio of the coupling constant to the mass of vector boson ranging from 7.07 @xmath48 to 12.25 @xmath48  @xcite .",
    "later on , successive work indicates that the u - boson with the ratio around 10 @xmath48 can even remedy largely the deviation between the soft and stiff eos s and the difference in the mass - radius relation of neutron stars as well  @xcite .",
    "we are intrigued to see whether the ground - state rearrangement can occur with these ratio parameters of the u - boson .",
    "unfortunately , as displayed in the fig .",
    "[ gc - rho ] , various @xmath49 are all larger than 40 @xmath48 .",
    "thus , it is usually impossible for nucleon systems to rearrange its ground state with the regular ratio @xmath50 that is around 10 @xmath48 , and we are not able to anticipate the constraint from whether or not the ground - state rearrangement occurs on the u - boson parameters . on the other hand ,",
    "this also reveals the fact that using the landau fermi liquid theory is appropriate for the usual nuclear fermi liquid .",
    "now , we discuss dark matter that is invisible by the strong , electro - weak but gravitational interaction . the properties of dark matter are totally unknown to date  @xcite . for instance , the mass of dark matter candidates can be assumed to vary from the magnitude of ev to several hundred of gev .",
    "supposing that dense dark matter can form , we are going to examine the ground - state rearrangement of dark matter by taking the mass of fermionic dark matter candidates as a free parameter . in this way",
    ", we still use eq.([eq4 ] ) by simply neglecting the terms concerning the meson exchanges that characterize the strong interactions .",
    "specifically , we calculate the @xmath51 at @xmath52 for various @xmath32 at the number density that equals to nuclear saturation density .",
    "the results are listed in table  [ tabthree ] .",
    "it is seen that the @xmath51 drops clearly with increasing the mass of the dark matter candidate . for @xmath53 , the critical coupling",
    "constant becomes as small as 0.11 which gives an interaction strength comparable to the electromagnetic interaction .",
    "this reveals a fact that the matter consisting of superheavy fermions can not be regarded as a simple fermi liquid as long as a weak repulsion exists .",
    "supposing that the heavy dark matter candidates stack up in the core of dense stars , the rearrangement may easily occur therein provided the repulsion comes up with the exchange of weakly interacting bosons .",
    ".ratios of the critical coupling constant to the vector boson mass at various @xmath32 for @xmath17=0.010 gev and @xmath54 [ tabthree ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as one can anticipate , to make sure the occurrence of rearrangement , the inequality @xmath55 should hold , while @xmath56 is the minimum acceleration to rearrange the ground state when the distance between the colliding particles is given .",
    "supposing the full stopping of the colliding system leads eventually to a fireball with the radius of a few femtometres , we estimate the @xmath56 by averaging the yukawa - type coupling and the coupling of the harmonic oscillator within such a sphere , namely , @xmath57    in this way , different critical decelerations for different postulated meson masses can be estimated . here , we use @xmath58 and @xmath59 as an example , and results are tabulated in table  [ tabone ] . as one can see , for @xmath60 , with @xmath61 , we get @xmath62 for the occurrence of rearrangement ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "this critical deceleration is really tremendous .",
    "however , it is not too difficult to reach such an enormous deceleration in relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "for instance , two nuclei , being accelerated almost up to the light velocity , crash against each other to be in full stopping in the time scale of a few femtometres , e.g. , @xmath64 , which is comparable to the size of stopped matter .",
    "then , the deceleration is @xmath65 which gives a reasonable and consistent magnitude of deceleration with those in table  [ tabone ] .",
    "the present estimate indicates that the non - inertial effect because of the huge deceleration can lead to the ground - state rearrangement .",
    "note that we do not consider the effect of thermalization at the late stage of the collision .",
    "the estimate also implies that as long as the gravitational field is sufficiently strong , the ground - state rearrangement may lead to deviation from the quasi - particle fermi liquid . for the case of larger density formed by the collision",
    ", we can get moderately smaller critical decelerations .",
    "however , the conclusion does not alter much for various densities of matter .",
    "we have investigated the applicability of the landau fermi liquid theory and found that the necessary stability condition for this theory may be broken in some circumstances .",
    "once the necessary stability condition is broken , the ground state is rearranged to be different from the step function . in our relativistic model ,",
    "the nuclear fermi liquid is stable with the usual strong interaction strength and no rearrangement occurs .",
    "this is nevertheless in sharp contrast with the system consisting of very heavy fermions that may be regarded as dark matter candidates .",
    "we have found that it is possible for heavy - fermion matter to rearrange the ground state even by exchanging the weakly coupling vector boson . in the case of the relativistic heavy - ion collisions , the ground state of the colliding systems",
    "can be rearranged due to the strong non - inertial effect which changes the ways of the quasi - particle occupation .",
    "this finding is potentially instructive in investigating the fermion system during the supernova explosions and in the horizon of black holes .",
