    "<S> effects of a corrupt source on the dynamics of simultaneous move strategic games are analyzed both for classical and quantum settings . the corruption rate dependent changes in the payoffs and strategies of the players are observed . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that there is a critical corruption rate at which the players lose their quantum advantage , and that the classical strategies are more robust to the corruption in the source . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it is understood that the information on the corruption rate of the source may help the players choose their optimal strategy for resolving the dilemma and increase their payoffs . </S>",
    "<S> the study is carried out in two different corruption scenarios for prisoner s dilemma , samaritan s dilemma , and battle of sexes .    * _ a . </S>",
    "<S> introduction : _ * classical game theory has a very general scope , encompassing questions and situations that are basic to all of the social sciences @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there are three main ingredients of a game which is to be a model for real life situations @xcite : the first of these is the rational players ( decision makers ) who share a common knowledge . the second is the strategy set which contains the feasible actions the players can take , and the third one is the payoff which are given to the players as their profit or benefit when they apply a specific action from their strategy set . </S>",
    "<S> when rational players interact in a game , they will not play dominated strategies , but will search for an equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> one of the important concepts in game theory is that of nash equilibrium ( ne ) in which each player s choice of action is the best response to the actions taken by the other players . in an ne , no player can increase his payoff by unilaterally changing her action . </S>",
    "<S> while the existence of a unique ne makes it easier for the players to choose their action , the existence of multiple ne s avoids the sharp decision making process because the players become indifferent between them . in pure strategies , the type and the number of ne s in a game depend on the game . </S>",
    "<S> however , due to von neumann there is at least one ne when the same game is played with mixed strategies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> classical game theory has been successfully tested in decision making processes encountered in real - life situations ranging from economics to international relations . by studying and applying the principles of game theory </S>",
    "<S> , one can formulate effective strategies , predict the outcome of strategic situations , select or design the best game to be played , and determine competitor behavior , as well as the optimal strategy .    in recent years </S>",
    "<S> , there have been great efforts to apply the quantum mechanical toolbox in the design and analysis of games @xcite . as it was the same in other fields such as communication and computation , quantum mechanics introduced novel effects into game theory , too . </S>",
    "<S> it has proved to have the potential to affect our way of thinking when approaching to games and game modelling . using the physical scheme proposed by eisert _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> ( see fig.[fig : scheme ] ) @xcite , it has been shown in several games that the dilemma existing in the original game can be resolved by using the paradigm of quantum mechanics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has also been shown that when one of the players chooses quantum strategies while the other is restricted to classical ones , the player with quantum strategies can always receive better payoff if they share a maximally entangled state @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum systems are easily affected by their environment , and physical schemes are usually far from ideal in practical situations . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is important to study whether the advantage of the players arising from the quantum strategies and the shared entanglement survive in the presence of noise or non - ideal components in the physical scheme . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we consider a corrupt source and analyze its effect on the payoffs and strategies of the players . </S>",
    "<S> we search answers for the following two questions : ( i ) is there a critical corruption rate above which the players can not maintain their quantum advantage if they are unaware of the action of the noise on the source , and ( ii ) how can the players adopt their actions if they have information on the corruption rate of the source .    * </S>",
    "<S> _ b . </S>",
    "<S> eisert s scheme : _ * in this physically realizable scheme the quantum version of a two - player - two - strategy classical game can be played as follows : ( a ) a referee prepares a maximally entangled state by applying an entangling operator @xmath0 on a product state @xmath1 where @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the output of this entangler ,    which reads @xmath3 $ ] , is delivered to the players . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) the players apply their actions , which are su(2 ) quantum operations locally on their qubits , and return the resultant state @xmath4 back to the referee . </S>",
    "<S> operators @xmath5 and @xmath6 are restricted to two - parameter su(2 ) operators given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) the referee , upon receiving this state , applies @xmath10 and then makes a quantum measurement @xmath11 with @xmath12 and @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> then the average payoffs of the players become @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the payoffs chosen from the classical payoff matrix when the measurement result is @xmath18 , and @xmath19 corresponds to the probability of obtaining @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> the classical version of the game can be played using the same scheme if the operations corresponding to the classical pure strategies are chosen as @xmath20 and @xmath21 .    using this scheme , quantum versions of some dilemma - containing classical games , such as prisoner s dilemma ( pd ) , samaritan s dilemma ( sd ) and battle of sexes ( bos ) whose </S>",
    "<S> payoffs matrices are given in fig.[fig : payoffs ] , have been studied . in these games , it has been understood that if the referee starts with the state @xmath22 generating the entangled state @xmath23 $ ] , the players can resolve their dilemma and receive the highest possible total payoff @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> it has also been shown that the dynamics of the games changes when the referee starts with a different initial state . </S>",
    "<S> for example , if the referee starts with @xmath25 in sd , four ne s emerge with the same constant payoff making a solution to the dilemma impossible @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> = 8.7 cm    * _ c . </S>",
    "<S> corrupt source in quantum games : _ * as we have pointed out above , the initial state from which the referee prepares the entangled state is a crucial parameter in eisert s scheme . therefore , any corruption or deviation from the ideality of the source which prepares this state will change the dynamics and outcomes of the game . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the analysis of situations where the source is corrupt is necessary to shed a light in understanding the game dynamics in the presence of imperfections . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the source model shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : corrupt ] . </S>",
    "<S> this model includes two identical sources constructed to prepare the states @xmath26 s which are the inputs to the entangler at each run of the game . these sources are not ideal and have a _ corruption rate _ , @xmath27 , that is , they prepare the desired state @xmath26 with probability @xmath28 while preparing the unwanted state @xmath29 with probability @xmath27 </S>",
    "<S> . the state prepared by these sources thus can be    written as @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> then the combined state generated and sent to the entangler becomes @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> this results in a mixture of the four possible maximally entangled states @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the state on which the players will perform their unitary operators .    </S>",
    "<S> * _ scenario i : _ * in this scenario , the players alice and bob are not aware of the corruption in the source . </S>",
    "<S> they assume that the source is ideal and always prepares the initial state @xmath22 , and hence that the output state of the entangler is always @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> based on this assumption , they apply the operations that is supposed to resolve their dilemma .    </S>",
    "<S> we have analyzed pd , sd and bos according to this scenario , and compared the payoffs of the players with respect to the corruption rate . </S>",
    "<S> the payoff they receive when they stick to their quantum strategies are compared to the payoffs when they play the game classically . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the classical counterparts both with and without the presence of noise in the game . </S>",
    "<S> that is , the players use the same physical scheme of the quantum version with and without the corrupt source , and apply their actions by choosing their operators from the set @xmath36 .    </S>",
    "<S> the results of the analysis according to this scenario are depicted in figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : pd]-[fig : bos ] . </S>",
    "<S> a remarkable result of this analysis is that with the introduction of the corrupt source , the players quantum advantage is no longer preserved if the corruption rate , @xmath27 , becomes larger than a critical corruption rate @xmath37 . at @xmath37 , </S>",
    "<S> the classical and quantum strategies produce equal payoffs . </S>",
    "<S> another interesting result is the existence of a strategy @xmath38 , where the payoffs of the players become constant independent of corruption rate .    </S>",
    "<S> this strategy could be attractive for risk avoiding and/or paranoid players .    for pd , which is a symmetric game , </S>",
    "<S> the optimal classical strategies deliver the payoffs @xmath39 for the actions @xmath40 . in the quantum version with an uncorrupt source </S>",
    "<S> , the players can get the optimal payoffs @xmath41 if they adopt the strategies @xmath42 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the dilemma of the game is resolved and the players receive better payoffs than those obtained with classical strategies . however , as seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : pd ] , the payoffs of players with classical and quantum strategies become equal to @xmath43 when @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath27 satisfies @xmath45 , the quantum version of the game always does better than the classical one . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise , the classical game is better .    </S>",
    "<S> when the classical version of pd is played with a corrupt source , we find that with increasing corruption rate , while the payoffs for the quantum strategy decrease , those of the classical one increase . </S>",
    "<S> that is , if @xmath46 , then the players would rather apply their classical strategies than the quantum ones . </S>",
    "<S> this can be explained as follows : when the players apply classical operations , the game is played as if there is no entanglement in the scheme . </S>",
    "<S> that is , players apply their classical operators @xmath21 on the state prepared by the source . if the source is ideal , @xmath47 , they operate on the @xmath48 which results in an output state @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> referee , upon receiving this output state and making the projective measurement , delivers @xmath39 . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath50 , the state from the source is @xmath49 and the output state after the players actions becomes @xmath48 . with this output state </S>",
    "<S> , referee delivers them the payoffs @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , when the players apply the classical operator @xmath21 , their payoffs continuously increase from one to three with the increasing corruption rate from @xmath47 to @xmath50 .    using a classical mixed strategy in the asymmetric game of sd , </S>",
    "<S> the players receive @xmath51 at the ne . in this strategy , while alice chooses from her strategies with equal probabilities , bob uses a biased randomization where he applies one of his actions , @xmath20 , with probability @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> the most desired solution to the dilemma in the game is to obtain an ne with @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> this is achieved when both players apply @xmath54 to @xmath35 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of the payoffs in this game with the corrupt source when the players stick to their operators @xmath54 and its comparison with their classical mixed strategy are depicted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sd ] . since this game is an asymmetric one , the payoffs of the players , in general , are not equal . </S>",
    "<S> however , with the corrupt source it is found that their payoffs become equal at @xmath55 and at @xmath50 , where the payoffs are @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the critical corruption rate , @xmath58 , which denotes the transition from the quantum advantage to classical advantage regions , is the same for both players . </S>",
    "<S> while for increasing @xmath27 , @xmath59 monotonously decreases from two to zero , @xmath60 reaches its minimum of @xmath61 at @xmath62 , where it starts increasing to the value of zero at @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting that when the players apply their classical mixed strategies in this physical scheme , @xmath59 is always constant and independent of the corruption rate , whereas @xmath60 increases linearly as @xmath63 for @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> the payoffs of the players are compared in three cases @xcite : _ case 1 _ : @xmath65 ( insufficient solution ) , _ case 2 _ : @xmath66 ( weak solution ) , and _ case 3 _ : @xmath67 ( strong solution ) . in the corrupt source scenario in quantum strategies , _ </S>",
    "<S> case 1 _ is achieved for @xmath68,_case 2 _ is achieved for @xmath69 , and finally _ case 3 _ for @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> the remarkable result of this analysis is that although the players using quantum strategies have high potential gains , there is a large potential loss if the source is deviated from an ideal one . </S>",
    "<S> the classical strategies are more robust to corruption of the source .    in bos , which is an asymmetric game , the classical mixed strategies , where alice and bob apply @xmath20 with probabilities @xmath71 and @xmath72 or vice versa , the players receive equal payoffs of @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the dilemma is not solved due to the existence of two equivalent ne . on the other hand , when the physical scheme with quantum strategies is used the players can reach an ne where their payoffs become @xmath73 and @xmath74 if both players apply @xmath21 to the maximally entangled state prepared with an ideal source @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage of this quantum strategy to the classical mixed strategy is that in the former @xmath24 is higher than the latter . in the presence of corruption in the source , payoffs of the players change as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : bos ] . with an ideal source , </S>",
    "<S> the payoffs reads @xmath75 , however for increasing corruption rate while @xmath59 decreases from two to one ,    @xmath60 increases from one to two . with an completely corrupt source , @xmath50 , </S>",
    "<S> the payoffs become @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for this is the same as explained for pd . </S>",
    "<S> when the quantum strategies with and without corrupt source are compared to the classical mixed strategy without noise , it is seen that the former ones always give better payoffs to the players . </S>",
    "<S> however , when the source becomes noisy ( corrupt ) , classical strategies become more advantageous to quantum ones with increasing corruption rate . </S>",
    "<S> the range of corruption rate where classical strategies are better than the quantum strategy if the players stick to their operations @xmath21 , are @xmath77 and @xmath78 for alice and bob , respectively . when @xmath79 , @xmath80 and these payoffs are equal to the ones received with classical mixed strategies . </S>",
    "<S> while @xmath80 independently of @xmath27 for classical mixed strategies , @xmath60 and @xmath59 differ when the players stick to their quantum strategies for @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> another interesting result for this game is that , contrary to pd and sd , the strategy @xmath38 discussed above always gives a constant payoff @xmath82 , which is better than that of the classical mixed strategy .    * </S>",
    "<S> _ scenario ii : _ * in this scenario , the referee knows the characteristics of the corruption in the source , and inform the players on the corruption rate . </S>",
    "<S> then the question is whether the players can find a unique ne for a known source with corruption rate @xmath27 ; and if they can , does this ne resolve their dilemma in the game or not . when the corruption rate is @xmath79 , </S>",
    "<S> the state shared between the players become @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> then independent of what action they choose , the players receive constant payoffs determined by averaging the payoff entries    .strategies which lead to ne s and the corresponding payoffs for the players in prisoner s dilemma ( pd ) if they are provided the information on the corruption rate , @xmath27 , of the source which prepares in the initial product state @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> [ tab : prob1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for the sd game . in this game , in contrast to the other two , </S>",
    "<S> although for @xmath47 there is a unique ne solving the dilemma , for @xmath50 the players can not find a unique ne . </S>",
    "<S> there emerges an infinite number of different strategies with equal payoffs @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> the players are indifferent between these strategies and can not make sharp decisions . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the dilemma of the game survives , although its nature changes .    </S>",
    "<S> when we look at some intermediate values for the corruption rate , we see that corruption rate affects bos and sd strongly . for example , when @xmath86 in sd , there are infinite number of strategies and ne s which have the same payoffs @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> these ne s are achieved when the players choose their operators as @xmath88 and @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> the same is seen in bos for @xmath90 which results in a payoff @xmath91 when the players choose @xmath92 and @xmath89 . a more detailed analysis carried out for pd with increasing @xmath27 in steps of @xmath93 in the range </S>",
    "<S> @xmath94 $ ] has revealed that the players can achieve a unique ne where their payoffs and strategies depends on the corruption rate . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , information on the source characteristic might help the players to reorganize their strategies . however , whether providing the players with this kind of information in a game is acceptable or not is an open question .    * </S>",
    "<S> _ d . </S>",
    "<S> conclusion : _ * this study shows that the strategies to achieve ne s and the corresponding payoffs are strongly dependent on the corruption of the source . in a game with corrupt source , </S>",
    "<S> the quantum advantage no longer survives if the corruption rate is above a critical value . </S>",
    "<S> the corruption may not only cause the emergence of multiple ne s but may cause a decrease in the player s payoff , as well , even if there is a single ne . if the players are given the characteristics of the source then they can adapt their strategies ; otherwise they can either continue their best strategy assuming that the source is ideal and take the risk of losing their quantum advantage over the classical or choose a risk - free strategy , which makes their payoff independent of the corruption rate . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the case where players know the corruption rate and adjust their strategies , the problem is that for some games there emerge multiple ne s , therefore the dilemmas in those games survive . </S>",
    "<S> this study reveals the importance of the source used in a quantum game .    </S>",
