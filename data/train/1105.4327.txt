    "the field of sliding friction has been recently revived thanks to experimental and theoretical advances especially connected with nanosystems , with brand new opportunities to grasp the underlying phenomena of this important and technologically relevant area . unlike macroscopic friction , where contact irregularities dominate , the nanoscale offers perfectly defined crystal lattice facets that can mutually slide . one fundamental piece of physics arising in this limit is the possibility of frictionless sliding when two perfect lattices are mutually incommensurate  their periodicities unrelated through any rational number an idealized situation sometimes referred to as superlubric  @xcite .",
    "graphite flakes sliding on graphite were for example shown to be pinned by static friction ",
    "the finite threshold force @xmath0 necessary to provoke motion  when aligned , but to turn essentially free sliding once a rotation makes them incommensurate  @xcite .",
    "an additional prediction , rigorously proven for one dimensional ( 1d ) infinite harmonic chains sliding in a periodic potential ( the `` corrugation '' potential , in frictional language ) , is that the incommensurate vanishing of static friction will only occur so long as the sliding chain is sufficiently hard compared to the corrugation strength . when instead that strength exceeds a critical value , the chain becomes locked , or `` pinned '' , to the corrugation , thus developing static friction despite incommensurability . unlike most conventional phase transitions",
    ", this celebrated aubry transition  @xcite involves no structural order parameter and no breaking of symmetry  just a change of phase space between the two states , the unpinned and the pinned one .",
    "the concept of pinned and unpinned states is by now qualitatively established in the sliding of real incommensurate 3d crystal surfaces  @xcite .",
    "yet , the onset of static friction in the prototypical 1d chain , where the aubry transition is mathematically established , has never been experimentally validated . even less is known about dynamic friction , about which we have no other insight than generic linear response  @xcite , and some data on 3d rare gas overlayers  @xcite both suggesting a quadratic increase with corrugation .",
    "cold atomic ions can form linear chains . despite their mutual coulomb repulsion",
    ", ions can be corralled inside effective potential traps generated by quadrupolar radio - frequency electrodes  @xcite .",
    "the low temperature ion equilibrium geometry is determined by the aspect ratio asymmetry of the confining potential , according to the effective hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath1   \\bigg\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the position of the @xmath3-th ion , @xmath4 its mass , @xmath5 its charge , and the three terms represent kinetic energy , coulomb repulsion , and the effective parabolic trapping potential respectively , with transverse and longitudinal trapping frequencies @xmath6 and @xmath7 . as is known experimentally  @xcite and theoretically  @xcite , by decreasing the asymmetry aspect ratio @xmath8 = @xmath9 the trap potential deforms from spherical to cigar - shaped , and the equilibrium ion geometry changes from 3d clusters to helices to chains , initially zig - zag and finally linear and straight along @xmath10 , as in fig .",
    "[ figura1](c ) .",
    "as many as a hundred ions may be stabilized in a linear configuration , with a few @xmath11 m ion - ion spacing @xmath12 , typical repulsion energy @xmath13 k , and temperatures below @xmath14k .",
    "so far , cold ion chains raised interest in view of promising applications for spectroscopy  @xcite , frequency standards  @xcite , study and control of chemical reactions  @xcite , and quantum information  @xcite .",
    "we are concerned here with the possibility that they could be of use in the field of friction .",
    "an interesting observation was made by garcia - mata et al .",
    "@xcite , that ion chains in an additional incommensurate periodic potential ( produced , e.g. , by suitable laser beams ) would , if only the spatial inhomogeneity of the trapping potential could be neglected , resemble precisely the 1d system where an aubry transition is expected as a function of corrugation strength .",
    "unfortunately , the trapping potential itself introduces an additional and brutal break of translational invariance , at first sight spoiling this neat idea .",
    "the ion - ion spacing is only uniform near the chain center , increasing strongly towards the two chain ends , where it diverges owing to the trap confinement ( see e.g. , fig .",
    "[ figura1 ] ) .",
    "incommensurability of the chain with the periodic potential is therefore lost , and seemingly with that all possibilities to study phenomena such as the vanishing of static friction at the aubry transition , a transition known to depend critically on a precisely defined value of incommensurability  @xcite .",
    "+    however , this conclusion is overly pessimistic . in contexts unrelated to friction , a finite chain in a periodic potential  @xcite",
    "is known to turn the would - be aubry transition to a structural phase transition .",
    "the transition survives , as we will show , despite the addition of the confining trap potential .",
    "the distorted state , prevailing at strong corrugation , exhibits under suitable conditions a change of symmetry and an accompanying displacive order parameter , measuring the breaking of inversion symmetry about the chain center .",
    "simulations carried out by pulling the trapped chain with a longitudinal force ( such as in principle provided by a static external electric field ) reveal that the distortion transition is associated with a continuous onset of static friction from zero to finite , thus mimicking at finite size , and despite the trapping potential , the static friction onset theoretically expected at the ideal aubry transition .",
    "in the rest of this work explicitly simulated _ gedanken experiments _ will demonstrate that trapped cold ions may in fact represent an idesal system for future nanotribological studies addressing both static and dynamic friction .",
    "in static friction , the celebrated aubry transition will become experimentally accessible for the first time . in dynamics , the friction rise with increasing corrugation should become measurable giving new impulse to future theory work .",
    "we simulate by means of standard ( weakly damped ) classical molecular dynamics @xmath15 ions trapped by the parabolic potential of eq.([hamiltonian ] ) , and seek first the static ( @xmath16 ) equilibrium geometry .",
    "below a critical aspect ratio @xmath17 the equilibrium geometry is a linear chain , while at @xmath18 there is a transition to a planar partly zig - zag structure ( see fig .",
    "[ figura1 ] and supplementary movie 1 ) , further evolving to a helical structure , and eventually to a 3d cluster when @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "choosing @xmath20 for the frictional simulation of 1d trapped linear chain , we introduce an additional periodic `` corrugation '' potential @xmath21 . to address the best studied case of aubry transition",
    ", we choose the corrugation wavelength @xmath22 to be `` golden ratio '' incommensurate relative to the chain center ion - ion spacing @xmath12 , @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "preserving the chain s inversion symmetry , the periodic potential phase is chosen so that the central ion sits at a potential maximum . at vanishing external force , the chain equilibrium configuration can then be followed while adiabatically increasing the corrugation amplitude @xmath24 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ figura2 ] , the chain ground state remains fully left - right symmetric right up to a critical corrugation amplitude @xmath25 , ( in dimensionless units , see methods ) , where it sharply turns asymmetric , the center of mass ( cm ) moving right or left by an amount @xmath26 ( see supplementary movie 2 ) .",
    "this transition , similar but not identical to that known for free finite chains  @xcite is the remnant of the aubry transition of the ideal infinite chain . in both the finite and the infinite chain , the probability to find an ion ( here the central ion ) sitting exactly at a periodic potential maximum vanishes above the critical corrugation strength , where the ion moves out to a minimum distance @xmath27 away from the potential maximum  @xcite . unlike the aubry transition that has no structural order parameter , the ( @xmath16 )",
    "finite chain transition is structural , characterized by a displacive order parameter @xmath28 , ising - like since the central ion can identically fall left or right of the centre .",
    "this order parameter grows continuously as @xmath29 at the transition , ( see fig .  [ figura2 ] ) .",
    "we find @xmath30 for the trapped linear ion chain  practically coincident with the exponent @xmath31 known for finite chains with short range forces and without trapping potential  @xcite .",
    "moreover , upon reducing the confining shape asymmetry by increasing the aspect ratio to @xmath32 , the chain equilibrium geometry evolves from linear to a partly planar zig - zag ( fig .",
    "[ figura2 ] ) , still symmetric about @xmath33 at @xmath34 . for increasing corrugation",
    "a symmetry - breaking transition similar to that of the linear chain takes place here too at @xmath35  a smaller value since in the zig - zag the ions are further apart  and for such case @xmath36 ( see supplementary movie 3 ) .",
    "for both the linear and the zig - zag chain the critical amplitude @xmath37 also depends upon the incommensurability ratio @xmath38 ( not shown ) .",
    "while these results are valid at @xmath39=0 , it should be stressed that as in all small size systems , temperature will cancel all symmetry breaking and order parameters , owing to thermal jumps taking place above the energy barrier @xmath40 which separates the two opposite ising like order parameter valleys .",
    "however , the mean time lapse between jumps diverges exponentially when @xmath41 , the trap blocking temperature . except too close to @xmath37 ,",
    "ion traps are routinely cooled down to temperatures of order @xmath42 ( in our units @xmath43 k ) way below the blocking temperature ( for example @xmath44k even for @xmath45 , barely above the critical @xmath35 ) .",
    "even at finite temperatures therefore , the ion chain will still break inversion symmetry and exhibit a distortive order parameter for macroscopically long times similar to the @xmath16 results detailed above .",
    "thus far the description of the ion trap in a periodic corrugation , while still free of external forces . to study static friction",
    "we apply a uniform force @xmath46 , such as that of an electric field parallel to the chain axis . the usual procedure used to determine static friction ",
    "the smallest force capable of causing a pinned - to - sliding transition , following which the chain is depinned with unlimited sliding  does not work here , since the field - induced center of mass displacement @xmath47 is finite by necessity , owing to the confining trap potential .",
    "we circumvent that problem by monitoring another quantity , namely the restoring force @xmath48 that must be applied to the chain in order to shift its cm coordinate back exactly to zero  keeping the chain s central ion exactly on top of the corrugation maximum at @xmath33 . in the infinite free chain",
    "this alternative definition of static friction coincides with the standard pinned - to - sliding peierls - nabarro threshold force @xmath49  @xcite , identifiable with the static friction @xmath0 of the system . in the pinned aubry state the critical force @xmath49 is exactly such as to drive to zero the minimum equilibrium deviation @xmath27 of one  kink \" away from the nearest corrugation maximum , eventually triggering the free motion which initiates the pinned - to - sliding transition of the whole system  @xcite .",
    "analogously , for trapped ions a growing external force @xmath46 gradually causes the central atom deviation from the potential maximum to decrease , and eventually to vanish at @xmath50 .",
    "we conclude that @xmath48 measures the static friction even in a trap , where proper free sliding is impeded . as shown in fig.[figura3 ] ( inset ) , for @xmath51 the central ion of the trap spontaneously remains precisely at zero , whence @xmath52 .",
    "however at @xmath53 where the force - free displacive order parameter @xmath28 turns spontaneously nonzero , a finite restoring force @xmath48 must be applied in order to cancel it .",
    "the growth of the symmetry restoring force @xmath48 with @xmath24 ( fig .",
    "[ figura3 ] ) is , despite the larger threshold , generally close to the aubry static friction expected theoretically for the infinite ideal chain  @xcite , when calculated for same chain parameters @xmath12 , @xmath24 and golden ratio @xmath22 , as those at the trapped chain center .",
    "we have thus established a connection between the trapped chain restoring force @xmath48 and the peierls - nabarro static friction of the infinite chain , of tribological significance  @xcite .",
    "numerical differences between the two are of course hardly surprising .",
    "the finite size @xmath54 cuts off the aubry critical region where the correlation length exceeds this size . for the same reason",
    "the chain depinning exponent @xmath55 , @xmath56 , which we find to be about @xmath57 differs from the higher exponent @xmath58 expected for the infinite free chain for short range forces  @xcite .",
    "the effective static friction of linear and zig - zag chains also differ slightly ( see fig .  [ figura3 ] ) , the softer zig - zag chain easier to pin , owing to its larger compliance than the linear chain .",
    "overall , both cases provide a measurable realization of the sharp onset of static friction at the aubry transition , valid beyond the limitations of a trapped chain .",
    "besides static friction and its aubry - like vanishing transition , ion traps could in addition provide nontrivial insight on dynamic friction .",
    "the onset of dynamical friction in depinned infinite chains is a very subtle event as discussed in literature  @xcite ; the pinned - to - sliding onset has been simulated and elegantly described by braun and coworkers  @xcite . in tribology",
    "we are primarily interested in the growth , for incommensurate sliders at finite sliding speed , of dynamical friction with increasing corrugation .    to simulate the chain dynamical behaviour we initially displace the ions away from their equilibrium configuration with a static field , then remove the field and follow the spontaneous `` ringdown '' damping of the bodily oscillation of the whole chain in the trap potential .",
    "for an initial large cm displacement of order @xmath59 @xmath12 the chain oscillation damping is readily observable , and can for weak corrugation @xmath60 be measured even in the absence of an external heat bath .",
    "the initial potential energy ( here about 0.1 ) is converted to joule heating of the chain , at a ringdown rate which is a direct measure of dynamic friction .",
    "actually , a trapped chain has an intrinsic dynamic friction even in the absence of corrugation , because of the trap - potential - induced transfer of kinetic energy from the cm motion to internal chain phonon modes .",
    "however , this effect is small ; the conversion and the corresponding dynamic friction is strongly enhanced by the corrugation potential , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figura4 ] and in supplementary movies 4 and 5 ( for the linear and zig - zag configurations of the chain , respectively ) .",
    "simulation of the chain oscillations yields a ringdown amplitude decay for both linear and zig - zag chains , of the form @xmath61 $ ] .",
    "we find that the lifetime @xmath62 strongly decreases for increasing @xmath24 .",
    "the corresponding increase of dynamic friction @xmath63 , directly proportional to @xmath64 , is to a good approximation quadratic , @xmath65 for weak corrugation ( fig .",
    "[ figura5 ] ) .",
    "a quadratic increase is just what the linear response theory predicts based on fermi s golden rule  @xcite",
    ". it also agrees with experimental quartz crystal microbalance monolayer friction data of coffey and krim  @xcite .",
    "there is in the literature no dynamic friction theory for the infinite linear chain to be used for comparison with the trapped chain results of fig .",
    "[ figura5 ] ; the present results can therefore be considered a first exploratory result in this direction .",
    "the exceedingly small values of @xmath66 speak for the strong harmonicity of the chain , whose cm motion can only with great difficulty excite the higher frequency intra - chain phonons in the absence of corrugation . the quadratic increase with @xmath24 reflects the effective opening of anharmonic excitation channels through umklapp scattering .",
    "larger oscillation amplitudes could not be readily simulated because the joule heat liberated would in that case be excessive and would destroy the chain in the lack of some external dissipation mechanism . a fully nonlinear behavior of dynamic friction would be expected to emerge in that case , with outcomes strongly dependent upon the heat disposal mechanism .",
    "the remarkable static and dynamic friction properties emerging for trapped ion chains seem well amenable to experimental study .",
    "the exceedingly small values of the distortion @xmath28 necessary to establish an accurate value for the effective static friction @xmath48 will require a fine tuning of corrugation and applied force . upon increasing the force however , the instant @xmath50 is reached and the symmetric position @xmath67 is attained , the chain will spontaneously jump over the barrier to the opposite ising order parameter valley .",
    "by e.g. , alternating in time rightward and leftward forces , the effective static friction @xmath48 could become readily detectable in experiment as the threshold force magnitude for the chain s cm to sway visibly leftward and rightward .",
    "the present static friction study is conducted at zero temperature , ignoring quantum effects , without external sources of either heating , cooling or damping , and assuming that a sufficiently strong effective periodic corrugation potential can be laser generated . while each of these points requires careful consideration , none , as will be discussed below ,",
    "is in our view fatal to the results presented for static friction .",
    "the proposed dynamic friction experiment would heat up the trapped ion chains , and cause their destruction once the joule heating is excessive .",
    "we verified however that even at a temperature of @xmath68 k , orders of magnitude higher than the effective chain debye temperature of @xmath69k ( considering mg@xmath70 ions separated by @xmath71 m ) , the chain is still stable in the strong trapping potential .    in conclusion , the field of cold atoms has had a tremendous development , recently covering important interdisciplinary areas such as anderson localization  @xcite .",
    "now the potential tribological impact of cold ion results could also be significant .",
    "the onset of static friction is a rich problem of current interest  @xcite , and so is the dynamic friction growth with corrugation@xcite .",
    "most importantly , ion chains represent a new clean design , free of most complications of real crystal lattices and with many more controllable parameters for a study of basic nanofrictional properties .",
    "* simulation details*. the equations of motion derived from ( [ hamiltonian ] ) turn dimensionless by defining the quantity @xmath72 , and expressing distance in units of @xmath73 , time in units of @xmath74 and the mass in units of @xmath4 . with this definition , energy and force are also dimensionless in units of @xmath75 and @xmath76 respectively .",
    "simulations are carried out using classical molecular dynamics , when necessary with a weak frictional damping , and mostly at zero or low temperature .",
    "the equations of motion have been integrated using a velocity - verlet algorithm with a time step @xmath77 time units .",
    "the threshold trap potential asymmetry @xmath78 for linear / zig - zag structure transition is determined with adiabatic increments @xmath79 starting from @xmath20 .",
    "the critical periodic corrugation potential amplitude @xmath37 for the symmetric - asymmetric transition of linear and zig - zag chains is obtained by adiabatic increments @xmath80 starting from an initial value @xmath81 for the zig - zag configuration and @xmath82 for the linear chain . in all",
    "the adiabatic increment procedures a small viscous damping @xmath83 , with @xmath84 , is applied to all ions in order to eliminate the excess energy . with our choice of @xmath85",
    "a total time of @xmath86 between successive increments is enough to damp all the excess energy away .",
    "a)temperature and quantum effects .",
    "the present study is conducted conventionally at zero temperature , ignoring quantum effects , without external sources of heating , cooling or damping , and assuming that a sufficiently strong periodic potential can be laser generated for the transition to take place at the given incommensurability provided by the laser field .",
    "even though temperature is in reality finite ( typically of order @xmath87 nk ) , the previously reported comparison between left and right chain distortion energies with @xmath88 implies a symmetry - broken state lifetime much longer than any measurement time , justifiying the zero temperature treatment , where data and their significance are clearer . in this regime",
    "moreover , quantum zero - point effects could in principle alter some of the details close to the depinning threshold , but are otherwise not expected to affect the overall friction picture , both static and dynamic .",
    "\\b ) corrugation potential magnitude . to produce the effective periodic corrugation potential ,",
    "the wavelength @xmath89 of a laser light must fit an electronic excitation in the spectrum of the chosen ion species ( e.g. @xmath90 nm for mg@xmath70 , @xmath91 nm for ca@xmath70 or @xmath92 nm for yb@xmath70 ) , with a typical @xmath93 m the golden mean incommensurate periodic potential wavelength is @xmath94 , nevertheless the desired @xmath22 value for the effective periodic potential can be obtained by laser beam crossing at a chosen angle [ 24 ] .",
    "experimentally , it is mandatory to realize a sufficient corrugation amplitude @xmath95 for the aubry transition to occur .",
    "assuming for example mg@xmath70 ions and golden ratio incommensurability , the critical amplitude of the effective periodic potential @xmath37 requires a laser intensity of some @xmath96 , which seems entirely within reach . on the other hand ,",
    "the aubry pinning transition becomes , as is well known , easier with any chain - corrugation incommensurability different from the golden ratio [ 25 ] , whereby in general the transition would occur with even with weaker corrugation amplitudes than @xmath97 .",

    "we assumed so far the possibility to position the corrugation potential maximum precisely at the minimum of the harmonic trap , a feat which may be experimentally difficult .",
    "slight shifts of the corrugation potential phase away from that point would however simply smear the aubry pinning onset in the same way a weak symmetry breaking field transition would affect a phase transition .",

    "in the oscillation ringdown simulations , the initial potential energy difference @xmath98 , due to the chain displacement of @xmath59 @xmath12 , is gradually converted to heating of the chain . with the mass of mg@xmath70 ,",
    "the final temperature reached is approximately @xmath99 k , orders of magnitude higher than the effective chain debye temperature of @xmath69k . despite that",
    ", we verified by direct simulation that at this temperature the chain is still stable in the strong trapping potential .",
