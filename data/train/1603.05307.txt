    "the research on cooperative filtering and estimation of networked systems has gained much momentum during the past decade , aiming at developing efficient estimation algorithms for large assemblies of networked sensors  @xcite .",
    "the mentioned references reflect the common trend in the literature , where the main objective is to accomplish a globally optimal or suboptimal estimation performance of the network . usually , the performance of individual sensors is not considered in such problems .",
    "this observation motivates the question about a relationship between the estimation performance of the individual filters within a distributed estimation network and the performance of the overall network .",
    "this paper considers this problem within the specific framework of distributed @xmath0 consensus estimation  @xcite .",
    "our approach also targets the global convergence problem however not with a brute - force decoupling of the global solution .",
    "rather we define a local objective function in terms of uncertain signals capturing the performance of the other nodes .",
    "this leads to decoupling of the distributed filter while implicitly maintaining a meaningful connection to the network .",
    "this way , the local objective function abstracts the dependence on other nodes , eliminating the need to consider their exact models or their raw measurements .",
    "nevertheless , the convergence of the local filter is dependent on the rest of the network and we provide conditions that render the @xmath0 convergence of the network of the filters .",
    "furthermore , by asserting further conditions on the individual performances of the other nodes a guaranteed @xmath0 performance of the individual filters is established .",
    "these conditions express that if all the neighbours maintain a certain level of accuracy then the local filter also guarantees a nominated @xmath0 performance . to establish the above relationship , here",
    "we analyze the distributed filter network consisting of estimators solving an auxiliary optimal filtering problem at every node . in that sense ,",
    "our approach bears some resemblance with decentralized control where each controller is constructed to regulate a local subsystem .",
    "the mentioned auxiliary filtering problem originates in  @xcite ; it was shown in  @xcite to yield interconnected consensus - type filters that exchange information between the network nodes although the parameters for each filter could be computed online in the decentralized fashion .",
    "the new element of this paper compared with  @xcite is how the neighboring information is interpreted by each node . in  @xcite , each node was considered to be agnostic about the amount of energy in the error between the true state of the plant and the neighbours estimates of that state . in contrast , here we consider a model where each node perceives a relationship between the energy in the neighbours error and the accuracy of its own filter .",
    "we give a detailed discussion of this idea later in the paper ; for now we only note that technically our model adds a constraint on the energy in the error inputs arising in the auxiliary minimum energy problems .",
    "such a constraint has the form of an integral quadratic constraint previously used in robust decentralized control problems and filtering problems ; e.g. , see @xcite .",
    "however , unlike those problems , the parameters of the constraints used here play the role of tunable parameters which are adjusted according to the desired local and global performance .",
    "they also serve as indicators of sensitivity of the individual filters to the neighbours performance .",
    "the main result of this paper are sufficient conditions on the network parameters that ensure @xmath0 performance of the network consisting of the proposed minimum energy filters .",
    "as mentioned , not only global disturbance attenuation is guaranteed by these conditions , but also certain local @xmath0 properties of the node filters are established .",
    "we show that these conditions admit the form of a convex semidefinite program , which enables constructing a filter network yielding a suboptimal disturbance attenuation .",

    "we will show that the matrices @xmath94 can be computed jointly with the attenuation levels @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
