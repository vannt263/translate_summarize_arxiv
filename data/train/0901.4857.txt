    "most of the accumulated knowledge about the physics of heterostructures assumes that the electrons in these materials are effectively described by the shrdinger equation , with a position dependent mass .",
    "the common belief is that dirac equation is of no use in condensed matter physics ( spin - orbit coupling can be treated using the pauli version of the schrdinger equation ) .",
    "the discovery of graphene @xcite changed drastically this perspective .",
    "condensed matter physicists are now facing a condensed matter system where the effective low - energy model for the quasiparticles is that of a ultrarelativistic , i. e. massless , dirac equation , albeit with an effective fermi velocity that is much lower than the velocity of light .",
    "in graphene the fermi velocity is @xmath0 , with @xmath1 the velocity of light .",
    "in fact , since the isolation of graphene crystallites @xcite that a renovated interest in the properties of the massless dirac equation in 2 + 1 dimensions started to emerge @xcite .",
    "although our interest in this paper is on the backscattering properties of electrons effectively described by the dirac equation in 1 + 1 dimensions , as an effective low - energy theory of the electronic properties of a quasi - one - dimensional solid , we shall revise some of the properties of dirac electrons in the context of graphene , given the accumulated amount of evidence for dirac fermions in graphene .",
    "how can the low - energy description of a solid be given by an effective dirac - like equation ?",
    "in one - dimensional physics , this takes place due to the linearization of the spectrum close to the fermi momentum , which introduces right- and left - movers with a linear energy - momentum relation .",
    "another possibility , that we discuss in the bulk of the paper , is by having two atoms per unit cell with special type of hopping . in two - dimensions ,",
    "this possibility has been realized by graphene .",
    "the electrons in graphene are confined to move within the @xmath2orbitals of system , formed from the overlap of the @xmath3 atomic orbitals of a single carbon atom .",
    "the transport and optical properties of graphene are determined essentially by the behavior of the @xmath2electrons .",
    "the electronic density is such that graphene has one @xmath2electron per carbon atom , and is therefore a half filled system .",
    "it turns out that the band structure of graphene around the _ fermi surface _ is highly non - standard , since the relation between the momentum and the energy is linear , with a proportionality coefficient given by @xmath4 m / s and termed fermi velocity .",
    "in fact , the _ fermi surface _ is reduced to two points ( the so called dirac points @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) in the brillouin zone , with a zero density of states at the fermi - points .",
    "this fact gives graphene its non - conventional properties .",
    "starting from a @xmath7 approach @xcite , adapted to degenerate bands off the @xmath8point @xcite , we obtain an effective hamiltonian in real space , valid around the @xmath5 point , having the form    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is a vector using the pauli matrices and @xmath11 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ hd2d ] ) is nothing but the dirac hamiltonian for massless particles in 2 + 1 dimensions , with an effective light - velocity @xmath12 .",
    "clearly , one expects that the physical properties of such a system will be different from those where the schrdinger equation is valid .",
    "note that this situation is an example of complex emergent behavior @xcite , since the original problem was that of independent electrons ( and therefore schrdinger like ) in a periodic potential .",
    "those electrons in graphene lying close to the fermi points ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) , will have a different response to external potentials than those in other materials described by the schrdinger equation .",
    "in fact , for schrdinger electrons , if we consider that the potential varies at a given point in space from zero to a finite value @xmath13 ( the so called step potential ) there is always a finite fraction of impinging electrons that are reflected back .",
    "more over , if @xmath13 is greater than the energy of the impinging particles , there will be an exponential attenuated wave function in the region where the potential is finite .    for dirac electrons",
    "the situation is different .",
    "it was shown by klein @xcite that dirac particles can not be confined by an arbitrary large potential @xmath13 .",
    "in fact , they pass through strong repulsive potential without the exponential decay that characterizes schrdinger particles .",
    "this is called klein tunneling .",
    "if the particles are massless and moving in one - dimension the situation is even more dramatic , since there is no backscattered probability flux , no matter how large the potential is @xcite .",
    "in addition to external potentials , a particle propagating in solid state systems can face a situation where its effective mass changes in space .",
    "this possibility takes place in heterostructures , where the mass of the particle is written as @xmath14 , @xmath15 being the position of the particle . in this situation",
    ", the schrodinger equation has to be modified , in other to comply with hermiticity and flux conservation .",
    "if the particles are described by the dirac equation , the information on the material properties is encoded both in the fermi velocity @xcite and in the mass .",
    "we can then imagine the possibility of producing a herestructure where the fermi velocity , @xmath16 , and the mass change with the position of the particle .",
    "as we show bellow , even in this case , there will be not backscattering if the particle is massless and the velocity is allowed to vary from point to point . in the context of graphene physics , a position - dependent fermi velocity was already considered in the case of curved graphene @xcite .",
    "another possibility of producing both a fermi velocity and a mass term that are position dependent is to subject the system to strain .",
    "it has already been shown using _",
    "ab - inito _ calculations , in the context of graphene physics , that strain leads to gap formation @xcite .",
    "it is to be expected that for general strain , different parts of the material presents local values of fermi velocity and energy gap .",
    "also in the case of graphene , it was shown that depositing the material on top of boron nitride leads to gap - formation @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we discuss several possibilities for the scattering of dirac particles through a region where both the velocity and the mass are position dependent .",
    "although our motivation is to study graphene strips @xcite in a latter publication , we start by giving two exact solutions for one - dimensional systems . the generalization to a quasi - one - dimensional system , such as a narrow nano - wire , is easy to obtained and will be given in a follow up publication . in order to see the differences between the schrdinger and the dirac problems , we start by revising the case of one - dimensional heterosctructures described by the schrdinger equations and latter move the study of the dirac case .",
    "in order to compare how the scattering of schrdinger electrons differs from that of dirac particles , we give a brief account of the scattering of electrons by the interface of a heterostructure .",
    "let us consider the case of 1d schrdinger electrons with position dependent effective mass @xmath17 , such that @xmath18 , for @xmath19 and @xmath20 , for @xmath21 .",
    "the boundary conditions in this case are ( see final paragraph of this section ; for more general boundary conditions see ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath22 we consider that the particles are moving from the left to the right .",
    "therefore the wave function is    @xmath23    where the values of @xmath24 and @xmath25 are fixed by energy conservation : @xmath26 the reflectance @xmath27 is determined from the boundary conditions as    @xmath28    which has the limiting value @xmath29 for @xmath30 .",
    "the transmittance coefficient @xmath31 is    @xmath32    we can check now that the boundary conditions used for the wave function are the correct ones , since they satisfy the flux current conservation . using absolute values , we have indeed @xmath33 with @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",
    "the problem just described represents an heterostructure , where two materials are _ glued _ together ( due to similar lattice constants ) , having different effective masses in the two materials .",
    "the used boundary conditions are obtained writing the hamiltonian as @xmath37 this choice defines an hermitian problem ) is a particular case of a sturm - liouville operator , which has the general form : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is to be determined from the boundary conditions , and @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 are given functions .",

    "the construction of the ( [ hs ] ) guaranties that the total probability flux is conserved .",
    "the boundary condition ( [ bcii ] ) , follows immediately from the writting the hamiltonian in the sturm - liouville form .",
    "let us now study the case of the dirac hamiltonian .",
    "we are interested in cases where both the velocity and the mass of the particles depend on their position in space .",
    "we study first the case of massless dirac particles , like those present on graphene .",
    "latter we add up the mass term .",
    "the hamiltonian for a massless quasiparticle described by an effective dirac equation , with an effective velocity of light @xmath12 , is given by    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is the @xmath46 pauli matrix .",
    "let us now consider that we make an heterostructure , made of two different materials , both of them described by an effective dirac equation , such as ( [ hd ] ) .",
    "an example could be a strip of the material where part of it is subjected to strain and other part is strain free ; this leads to different velocities in the two parts of the material .",
    "this situation calls for a model where @xmath12 is position dependent : @xmath47 .",
    "although this situation does not make sense in high - energy physics , it is quite conceivable in condensed matter physics , since the value of @xmath12 is determined by the material under consideration ",
    "different materials can have different fermi velocities .",
    "the trivial replacement @xmath48 renders the problem non - hermitian , as can be seen by applying the definition given above , when we discussed the schrdinger case .",
