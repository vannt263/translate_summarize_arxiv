    "rotation is a basic physical property of astrophysical objects .",
    "study of rotational properties of stars can lead to some restrictions imposed on the nuclear equation of state of dense matter at densities larger than nuclear density.oscillations of rapidly rotating stars can become unstable hence producing detectable gravitational wave emissions .    in the past decades there were numerous attempts to construct analytic models for rotating perfect fluid bodies in general relativity . but obtaining an exact interior solution for a rotating body proved to be a formidable task.the first step in this direction was the fundamental result of kerr [ 1 ] who obtained the solution for the vacuum domain , outside the rotating star .",
    "it took no less than three decades of investigations to obtain the first , highly idealized model of a general relativistic , thin rotating disk of dust , by neugebauer and meinel [ 2 ] .",
    "various schemes have been developed for obtaining stationary and axisymmetric perfect fluid solutions of the gravitational equations like petrov type d , local rotational symmetry , fluid kinematics , non - trivial killing tensor , vanishing simon tensor , electric magnetic weyl curvature , lagrangian or static- stationary symmetry , geodesic eigenrays etc .",
    "( for a recent review of rotating perfect fluid models in general relativity see [ 3 ] ) .",
    "if in the case of rapidly rotating stellar configurations there are still many unsolved problems , a remarkable progress has been made in the study of slowly and rigidly rotating perfect fluid configurations . by casting",
    "the metric in the form @xmath1 + o\\left ( \\omega ^{2}\\right),\\ ] ] hartle [ 4 ] obtained a formalism that proved to be very useful in many investigations of the rotational properties of stars . however",
    ", this model , which considers only first order corrections in @xmath2 , can not be used to compute models of rapidly rotating relativistic stars with sufficient accuracy .",
    "on the other hand there has been recently a considerable advance in the numerical understanding of rotating stars .",
    "several high precision numerical codes are now avalaible and it has been shown that they agree with each other to remarkable accuracy ( see [ 5 ] for a review of recent developments in numerical study of rotatation , nonaxisymmetric oscillations and instabilities of general relativistic stars ) .",
    "the non - sphericity of rapidly rotating stationary stellar configurations and the complicated character of the interplay of the effects of rotation and of those of general relativity seem not to permit a simple universal description of rotating compact objects .",
    "however , haensel and zdunik [ 6 ] and friedman , ipser and parker [ 7 ] have found a simple relation connecting the maximum rotation frequency @xmath3 with the maximum mass @xmath4 and radius @xmath5 of the static configuration : @xmath6 with @xmath7 a constant which does not depend on the equation of state of the dense matter .",
    "the value of the constant @xmath7 has been obtained by fitting equation ( [ eq1 ] ) with data obtained by numerically integrating the gravitational field equations .",
    "it is given by @xmath8 [ 7 ] , @xmath9 [ 8 ] or by @xmath10 [ 9 ] .",
    "the empirical relation ( [ eq1 ] ) has been checked for many realistic equations of state for neutron stars [ 8 ] , [ 10]-[12 ] and for the case of strange stars where the empirical formula also holds with a very good precision , the relative deviations do not exceeding 2% [ 9 ] .",
    "equation ( [ eq1 ] ) , obtained on the basis of analyzing numerical solutions of the gravitational field equations , provides an enormous simplification of the problem of dynamical effects of rotation because the solutions of the complicate general relativistic equations for a rotating star can be replaced with the solutions of the much simpler tov equation . some attempts to explain this empirical relation",
    "were not concluded with satisfactory result .",
    "weber and glendenning [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] used numerical models of slowly rotating relativistic stars to show that the formula still hold , but with @xmath11 .",
    "also in the slow rotation limit glendenning and weber [ 15 ] derived a formula relating @xmath12 to @xmath13 , in terms of the mass , equatorial radius , moment of inertia , angular momentum and quadrupole moment of the maximally rotating configuration only .",
    "but it is not clear how the formula ( [ eq1 ] ) follows from their results.up to now a clear physical understanding of this relation is still missing .    on the other hand a universal relation between the maximum mass and radius of non - rotating neutron star configuration and the mass @xmath14 and radius @xmath15 of the configuration rotating with @xmath0 of the form @xmath16 has also been found [ 12 ] . in ( [ eq2 ] )",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath18 are specific equation of state dependent constants , whose values have been calculated , for a broad set of realistic eos , in [ 12 ] .",
    "their mean values are @xmath19 and @xmath20 [ 12 ] .",
    "the empirical constant @xmath7 can be obtained , within an approximation better than @xmath21 , from the formula [ 12 ] @xmath22    the general validity of ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) suggests the possibility that all basic physical parameters of general relativistic rotating stellar objects ( like mass and radius ) can be somehow related to the similar parameters of the static configuration .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to propose a general description of basic physical parameters ( mass , radius and oblateness ) of compact general relativistic objects in terms of the physical properties of the static configuration and of the angular velocity only . to obtain the representation in terms of static physical parameters we use only the general relativistic conditions of equilibrium for static and rotating stars and some phenomenological",
    "assumptions.the resulted approximate mass and radius formulae are compared with data obtained from numerical integration of gravitational field equations in case of neutron stars described by realistic equations of state and strange stars described by the bag model equation of state .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows.the general formalism allowing to obtain mass and radius formulae for rotating general relativistic stars is presented in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we apply our results to the case of neutron stars described by realistic equations of state . in section 4",
    "we consider the case of strange stars .",

    "we shall also make the assumption that the matter eos is a one parameter dependent function , @xmath28 with @xmath29 the proper baryon density .",
    "for such an equation of state the heat function defined by @xmath30 is a regular function of @xmath29.it can always be written in the form [ 16 ] @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the enthalpy per baryon .",
    "as applied at the center and at the surface of the star respectively , the hydrostatic equilibrium condition yields @xmath33    at the vacuum boundary of the static star the schwarzschild exterior solution gives the metric and we have [ 17 ] @xmath34 with @xmath35 and @xmath36 the mass and radius of the static stellar configuration .",

    "we assume that the vacuum boundary of the rotating star is described by the kerr metric [ 1 ] in the boyer - lindquist coordinates , which has the form [ 18 ] : @xmath71 d\\phi ^{2}-2\\frac{2m_{rot}ra\\sin ^{2}\\theta } { r^{2}+a^{2}\\cos ^{2}\\theta } dtd\\phi .",

    "we shall generalize this equation to the rotating case by assuming that the following formula relates the mass of the rotating star to its equatorial radius : @xmath93 with @xmath94 a function describing the combined general relativistic effects of rotation and central density on the mass of the star and with @xmath46 the same specific density as used in the static case .",

    "the correct mathematical and physical modelling of millisecond pulsars can be done only in the framework of general relativistic equilibrium models for rapidly rotating neutron stars.such models are solutions of the einstein s equations for the axisymmetric stationary gravitational field and they must be constructed numerically . recently several independent numerical codes have been developed by different groups of researchers and have been used to obtain rapidly rotating neutron star models based on a variety of realistic equations of state.hence a large amount of numerical data is now available .    in the present section",

    "it is generally believed today that strange quark matter , consisting of u-,d- and s quarks is energetically the most favorable state of quark matter .",
    "witten [ 27 ] suggested that there are two ways of formation of the strange matter : the quark - hadron phase transition in the early universe and conversion of neutron stars into strange ones at ultrahigh densities.in the theories of strong interactions quark bag models suppose that the breaking of physical vacuum takes place inside hadrons . as a result",
    "the vacuum energy densities inside and outside a hadron become essentially different and the vacuum pressure on a bag wall equilibrates the pressure of quarks thus stabilizing the system .",
    "if the hypothesis of the quark matter is true , then some of neutrons stars could actually be strange stars , built entirely of strange matter [ 28],[29 ] .",
    "caldwell and friedman [ 30 ] have presented arguments against the existence of strange stars .",
    "for a recent review of strange star properties see [ 31 ] .",
    "there are several proposed mechanisms for the formation of quark stars after galaxy formation .",
    "strange stars are expected to form during the collapse of the core of a massive star after the supernova explosion as a result of a first or second order phase transition , resulting in deconfined quark matter [ 32].another possibility for strange star formation is that some rapidly spinning neutron stars in low - mass x - ray binaries ( lxmbs ) can accrete sufficient mass to undergo a phase transition to become strange stars [ 33 ] . in this scenario",
    "it is supposed that at the beginning of accretion the mass of the neutron star is 1.4 .",
    "it has been shown [ 34 ] that the amounts of matter accreted by 18 millisecond pulsars in binary systems exceed @xmath157 .",
    "hence some of the millisecond pulsars may be strange stars.strange stars have also been proposed as sources of unusual astrophysical phenomena , e.g. soft @xmath158-ray repeaters [ 35],pulsating x - ray burster [ 36 ] , cosmological @xmath158-ray bursts [ 35 ] , [ 37 - 38 ] etc.the mechanism of the phase transition from neutron to quark stars in low lxmbs also results in the excitation of stellar radial oscillations that can be damped by gravitational wave radiation instead of internal viscosity [ 39 ] .the discovery of khz quasi - periodic oscillation in lxmbs [ 40 ] implies that the compact stellar object must have very soft equation of state , which is consistent with that of strange stars [ 41 - 42 ] .    assuming that interactions of quarks and gluons are sufficiently small the energy density @xmath159 and pressure @xmath26 of a quark - gluon plasma at temperature @xmath160 and chemical potential @xmath161 ( the subscript f denotes the various quark flavors u , d , s etc . ) can be calculated by thermal theory .",
    "neglecting quark masses in first order perturbation theory and supposing that quarks are confined to the bag volume ( in the case of a bare strange star , the boundary of the bag coincides with stellar surface ) , the equation of state is @xmath162 where @xmath58 is the difference between the energy density of the perturbative and non - perturbative qcd vacuum ( the bag constant ) .",
    "equation ( [ q ] ) is essentially the equation of state of a gas of massive particles with corrections due to the qcd trace anomaly and perturbative interactions.these are always negative , reducing the energy density at given temperature by about a factor two [ 43 ] . in the limit @xmath163 ( at the star s surface ) we have @xmath164 .",
    "the equation of state ( [ q ] ) does not depend upon quark flavor number , hence it will be correct either for strange quark matter ( @xmath165 ) or for normal quark matter ( @xmath166 ) . for any intermediate values of @xmath167 the state equation ( [ q ] ) gives the pressure with error less than 4% [ 31].thus the equation of state of strange matter is mainly determined by the vacuum energy density @xmath58 .",

    "as applied on the star surface the mass continuity equation leads to a rough approximation of the quark star mass of the form @xmath213 .",
    "a mass - radius relation of this form could also describe zero pressure quark matter , with @xmath214,@xmath215 and @xmath216 .",

    "the maximum radius of the strange star is obtained from the condition @xmath230.the corresponding algebraic equation has the solution @xmath231 ( this value depends of course on the value of @xmath58),giving the value of the ratio of the central pressure and bag constant for the maximum allowable radius @xmath171 of the static strange star.this can be expressed as @xmath232 and its numerical value for @xmath233 is @xmath234.from the condition @xmath235 it follows that @xmath236 and the maximum mass of the static quark star is given by @xmath237    from equation ( [ q17 ] ) and for the chosen value of the bag constant , we obtain a value of @xmath238.these results are in good agreement with the previously proposed ( witten [ 27],haensel , zdunik and schaeffer [ 29 ] ) maximum radius and mass values , given by equations ( [ q1 ] ) ( from equations ( [ q1 ] ) and for @xmath239 we obtain @xmath240).for values of @xmath241 static quark star models would be unstable to radial perturbations .    as an application of the mass and radius formulae obtained for the static strange stars we shall derive an explicit expression for the total energy of the quark star .",

    "we shall consider now the study of the rotating strange star configurations .",
    "we shall compare our results obtained with the use of equations ( [ b])-([bbb ] ) and ( [ q14])-([q15 ] ) with the results provided by stergioulas , kluzniak and bulik 42  and obtained by numerically integrating the gravitational field equations for maximally rotating (  keplerien  ) models of strange stars.the results of stergioulas et al.42  are also in very good agreement with the results of the exact numerical models of rotating strange stars built of self bounded quark matter of gourgoulhon et al .",
    "9 , the difference between these two works being smaller than @xmath130 . in order to improve the accuracy of the expressions ( [ b])-([bbb ] ) we shall consider that the function @xmath256 can be expressed in a more general form as @xmath257    and we will assume that the parameters @xmath107 and @xmath258 are not constants , but some angular velocity dependent functions given by @xmath259 @xmath260    equations ( [ q23])-([q24 ] ) take into account the variation of the central density of the maximally rotating strange star due to the increase of the angular velocity .    in fig.4",
    "we have represented the variation of the radius of the strange stars , given by equation ( [ q22 ] ) together with the angular velocity dependent functions @xmath107 and @xmath258 and the values given in stergioulas et al.42 , calculated for the same values of the central density and angular velocity.the mean of the difference between these two sets of values is smaller than @xmath130 .",
    "the variation of the radius of the maximally rotating strange star as a function of both central density and angular velocity is represented in fig.5.figs.6 and 7 present the variation of the mass of the rapidly rotating strange star as a function of @xmath261  the angular velocity @xmath110 and of @xmath262 and central density , respectively .    from equation ( [ b ] ) and equations ( [ q14 ] ) and ( [ q15 ] )",
    "it follows that the radius of the rotating strange star can be expressed , as a function of the central density and angular velocity only , in the following form : @xmath263    hence in this approximation the basic rotational parameters of maximally rotating strange star can be represented in terms of the static configuration and of the angular velocity only .",
    "in the present paper we have suggested the possibility of the existence of a universal pattern expressing the basic properties of rotating compact object as simple functions of the parameters of the static object and of the angular velocity only .",
    "we have obtained exact formulae which give the dependence of the radius and mass of the static and rotating stars on the central density of the stellar object and of its angular velocity.in the static case this is made possible due to the constancy of the chemical potential .",
    "the two unknown functions involved in the model must be obtained by fitting the exact formulae with data obtained from the numerical integration of the structure equations of the neutron or quark star .",
    "the resulting analytical expressions can reproduce the radius and mass of the strange star with an error smaller than @xmath130 and they also provide a simple way to obtain the maximum mass and radius of the static configuration .",
    "in the rotating case , with the use of the hydrostatic equilibrium condition , which is the consequence of the bianchi identities , we have also obtained exact mass - radius relations , depending on three functions describing the effect of rotation on star structure.these relations are exact in the sense that they have been obtained without any special assumptions.by assuming some appropriate forms for the unknown functions we have obtained a general description of the mass and radius of the rotating neutron or strange stars , which generally and for a broad class of equations of state can reproduce the values obtained by numerical integration of the gravitational field equations with a mean error of around @xmath21.the expressions of the unknown parameters have been chosen following a close analogy with the static case , whose relevance for the study of rotating general relativistic configurations seems to be more important than previously believed.these functions also incorporate some other general relativistic effects not explicitly taken into account , like the variation of the moment of inertia of the star with the angular velocity .",
    "ravenhall and pethick [ 19 ] have presented a formula valid for a broad range of realistic equations of state of dense matter expressing the moment of inertia in terms of stellar mass and radius .",
    "we have not used these results , obtained in the slow rotation limit because , at least in the case of strange stars , the newtonian expression of the moment of inertia also leads to a quite accurate physical description of the rotating objects.as an application of the obtained formulae we had given a derivation of the `` empirical '' formula relating the maximum angular velocity to the mass and radius of the static maximal stellar configurations .",
    "the possibility of obtaining the basic parameters of general relativistic rotating objects in terms of static parameters could lead to a major computational simplification in the study of rotation.the relation between the presented formalism and the einstein gravitational field equations will be the subject of a future publication ."
