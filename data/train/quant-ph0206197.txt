    "there have been an increasing number of discussions on entanglement and its applications in the context of quantum information processing . in particular , because of convenient manipulation of lasers , entanglement for gaussian continuous - variable states has been studied extensively @xcite .    a two - mode squeezed state is an entangled gaussian continuous - variable state which becomes maximally entangled when it is infinitely squeezed .",
    "once the pure two - mode squeezed state is embedded in an environment , entanglement is degraded . in this paper , we are interested in the dynamics of entanglement in an environment . in the vacuum environment ,",
    "the two - mode squeezed state never becomes separable regardless of the initial degree of squeezing @xcite . at non - zero temperature",
    ", entanglement is degraded faster and it is eventually lost @xcite .    in quantum optics , correlated ( phase - sensitive ) reservoirs @xcite , sometimes called `` rigged reservoirs '' , based on the establishment of squeezed light have been studied extensively .",
    "it has been shown that the decay rate of quantum coherence for a single - mode field can be significantly modified compared to the decay rate in an ordinary phase - insensitive thermal reservoir @xcite .",
    "depending on the phases of the quantum system and the correlated reservoir the decay rate of quantum coherence can be either enhanced or significantly suppressed .",
    "suppression of the decay rate of the quantum coherence leads to preservation of non - classical features such as squeezing , sub - poissonicity and oscillations in photon number distribution @xcite .    in this paper",

    "entanglement is due to inter - mode quantum coherence .",
    "is there a possibility to keep the inter - mode quantum coherence as we squeeze the environment ? to answer this question , we first find the dynamics of the two - mode squeezed state in a phase - sensitive environment in section ii .",
    "we then analyse the entanglement of this state using the entanglement condition developed for gaussian continuous - variable states @xcite in section iii .",

    "the lifetime of entanglement is maximised for @xmath65 , which is the same squeezing angle as that for the two - mode squeezed state of the system ( recall @xmath17 has been taken positive real ) .",
    "now we want to examine the possibility that the entanglement of the two - mode squeezed state can survive longer by squeezing the environment .",

    "when @xmath65 we can use the separability condition ( [ separability - condition ] ) which leads to @xmath93 it is obvious that the lhs is minimised when @xmath94 for fixed @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "we have proved that _ squeezing the environment does not help to keep the entanglement of the two - mode squeezed state longer_. this is one of the main results of this paper .",
    "entanglement , which is due to the inter - mode coherence , does not survive longer in the phase - sensitive than in the phase - insensitive environment .",
    "this result contrasts to the single - mode case where quantum coherence may last longer in the phase - sensitive environment .",
    "a system always gains extra noise due to its interaction with an environment . for a phase - sensitive environment , the extra noise",
    "is reduced along one quadrature axis at the expense of expanding noise along its conjugate axis . the quantum coherence imposed in one quadrature",
    "can last longer by adding the reduced noise . in the variance matrix ( [ standard-0 ] ) ,",
    "@xmath70 and @xmath71 determine the quadrature variances for local states of modes @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and @xmath91 and @xmath92 show the inter - mode correlation @xcite . as the initial two - mode squeezed state @xmath97 , interacts with an environment , @xmath70 and @xmath71 grow .",
    "if we squeeze the environment , the amounts of added noise become different and the lhs of eq .",
    "( [ separability - condition ] ) gets larger .",
    "we have seen that because the entanglement is due to both quadrature variables , reducing the extra noise in one quadrature does not lengthen its lifetime .",
    "in fact , we can interpret this using the einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) argument @xcite , which is related to entanglement .",
    "epr argues that it is possible to infer values for two conjugate variables of particle 2 from the measurement of their counter parts for particle 1 when the two particles are perfectly correlated .",
    "the epr argument is clearly concerned with the product of uncertainties for conjugate quadratures which is increased more rapidly by interaction with phase - sensitive reservoirs .",
    "we have so far considered the case where the two modes of the environment are in the same condition . by this restriction ,",
    "the problem became simple and we could see the impact of squeezing the environment clearly . what happens if the two modes are under different conditions ?",
    "this case was considered for phase - insensitive environments @xcite .",
    "when the two modes of the environments are in different conditions , we are not able to use the separability condition ( [ separability - condition ] ) because the variance matrix is no longer in the form ( [ standard-0 ] ) .    the consideration of very general interaction with phase - sensitive environments is complicated so we still restrict ourselves to the case where @xmath98 , @xmath99 and normalised interaction times @xmath100 .",
    "the dynamic characteristic function for the interaction of the system with the two environments with different squeezing is represented by the variance matrix @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "simon s separability criterion ( [ simonscriteriondetform ] ) then becomes @xmath104 if this inequality is violated the state in question is inseparable , _",
    "i.e. _ entangled .",
    "note that we still have @xmath105 equal for the two modes of the environment .    as a special case",
    ", we prove that when one mode of the entangled state decoheres into a phase - sensitive environment and the other mode into a phase - insensitive environment , the lifetime of entanglement does not get lengthened compared to the case when both the modes decohere to phase - insensitive environments .",
    "we know that @xmath106 in eq.([oursimonscriterion ] ) is a monotonously increasing function between @xmath107 as entanglement is not increased by interacting with environments . thus our task is to show @xmath108 by substituting eq.([19 ] ) into eq.([oursimonscriterion ] ) , @xmath109 & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as @xmath110 , @xmath111 will determine the sign . using eq.([19 ] ) , we find that @xmath112 it is straightforward to show that @xmath113 is always positive between @xmath107 .",
    "we have thus proved eq.([simcritthermalvssq ] ) and shown that making one mode of the environment phase - sensitive does not prolong the lifetime of entanglement .    in figure [ fig1 ] the contrast between a two - mode squeezed channel interacting with thermal environments and",

    "the squeezing of the thermal environment results in a reduction of the coherent lifetime .",

    "we have investigated the possibility of keeping entanglement longer by squeezing the environment .",
    "we have found that squeezing the environment shortens the coherence lifetime of the system .",
    "owing to the fact that entanglement is due to the quantum nature in both of the quadratures so that reducing added noise into one quadrature does not lengthen the lifetime because this action is done at the expense of stretching the added noise into the conjugate quadrature .",
