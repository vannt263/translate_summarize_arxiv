    "the isolation of graphene , a honeycomb lattice of carbon atoms , and the observation of the electric - field effect in the nanostructured samples , deposited on oxidized silicon surface , have renewed interest in the electronic properties of this two - dimensional carbon material . @xcite the breakthrough discovery made possible the experimental observation of theoretically predicted exotic physics of graphene , including an anomalous half - integer quantum hall effect , non - zero berry s phase , and minimum conductivity .",
    "@xcite    the exceptional properties of graphene , two - dimensional structure and room - temperature high mobility , make it an ideal material for carbon - based nanoelectronics envisaged in the future nanotechnologies .",
    "various applications depend on the possibility of fabricating a graphene - based field effect transistor ( fet ) , including transistors to be used in nanoscale electronic circuits , light emitters and detectors , and ultra - sensitive chemical sensors and biosensors .",
    "@xcite being a zero - gap semiconductor , however , graphene can not be used directly as the conducting channel in fets .",
    "discovering how to generate band gaps is therefore a question of fundamental and applied significance .",
    "several possibilities exist . lateral confinement of the charge carriers in graphene nanoribbons ( gnrs ) , @xcite and different gate voltages applied to the two layers of bilayer graphene are promising methods of engineering band gaps in graphene .",
    "@xcite recently , a band gap has been discovered in epitaxial graphene derived from graphitization of silicon carbide .",
    "@xcite the effect of a substrate - induced band gap has also been investigated experimentally in epitaxial graphene on nickel , @xcite and theoretically in graphene on boron nitride .",
    "@xcite    one of the routes toward tailoring the electronic properties of graphene is through the adsorption of metals .",
    "@xcite alkali metals , in particular , are donors of electrons and can be used for the purpose of doping graphene to change its carrier concentration . the related problem of adsorption of alkali metals on graphite , which consists of weakly linked layers of graphene , has been studied extensively in the past .",
    "@xcite in a quite recent study , a band gap was experimentally observed , and theoretically confirmed , in the surface electronic structure of graphite , induced by the adsorption of sodium in a @xmath4 model .",
    "@xcite the similar effect has also been reported for the @xmath5 model .",
    "@xcite due to the heavy doping , however , the fermi level is displaced into the graphene conduction @xmath6 band so that the band gap lies in the occupied levels .",
    "the gap - inducing mechanism in these cases involves doping as well as interaction between the graphene layers in the graphite surface .",
    "in this paper , we study the gap - inducing effect of alkali - metal adsorption on single layer graphene , which represents a different problem than graphite surface since the gap can not be due to interlayer interactions .",
    "for instance , first - principles calculations of metal adsorption on graphene in the @xmath5 model @xcite do not show a gap at the dirac point in the density of states ( dos ) .",
    "we present the case of lithium on graphene compound c@xmath1li in detail for several reasons .",
    "this is a prototypical system in which the gap opening effect occurs , it is a simple system to study theoretically , and it may be accessible experimentally .",
    "the crucial property here is the structure of the system , so that other alkali and alkaline - earth metal compounds c@xmath7 can exhibit the same effect .",
    "for instance , a similar band gap has been calculated for calcium graphite intercalated compound , @xcite as well as for calcium on graphene , both as c@xmath1ca .",
    "@xcite due to doping , lithium or another alkali metal on graphene results in a metal and is not directly useful for semiconductor applications .",
    "it is , however , important to understand the mechanism responsible for the gap opening effect .",
    "an interesting question is which coverages of an alkali metal on graphene can induce a band gap in its spectrum .",
    "our first - principles density functional theory ( dft ) calculations indicate the absence of a gap in @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath5 models , corresponding to c@xmath10li , c@xmath11li , and c@xmath12li , respectively , but its presence in the @xmath0 structure , which includes c@xmath13li and c@xmath1li , as well as in @xmath14 coverage c@xmath15li . explaining the underlying reason is the subject of the following sections .    our paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ dft ] presents the results of dft calculations .",
    "section [ tbm ] develops the tight - binding ( tb ) model .",
    "it includes a description of the lattice geometry , from which we clarify the gap mechanism within the tb model .",
    "we conclude here that , when lithium atoms are arranged above the hollow sites of graphene honeycomb lattice in a periodic commensurate structure to form c@xmath1li , the nearest - neighbor hopping amplitudes acquire alternating values constructed in a kekul - type structure .",
    "this section also includes a discussion of the tb hamiltonian and numerical results for the kekul textured model with two hopping amplitudes .",
    "section [ con ] contains a summary and conclusion .",
    "the appendix develops the solution of the tb model .",
    "quantitative data for the electronic band structure of c@xmath1li were obtained from dft calculations , using a plane wave basis set and pseudopotentials .",
    "we used the quantum - espresso code and norm - conserving pseudopotentials , @xcite and performed the calculations with local - density approximation ( lda ) and perdew - zunger parametrization @xcite of the ceperley - alder correlation functional .",
    "@xcite we used a lattice parameter of @xmath16    for graphene , corresponding to a c - c bond length of @xmath17   .",
    "other theoretical calculations @xcite have shown that alkali metals generally prefer to adsorb on the hollow sites of graphene rather than the bridge or top sites .",
    "we positioned the lithium atoms over the hollow sites of graphene in a @xmath0 commensurate superstructure .",
    "we remark , however , that lithium has not been shown to coat graphene or graphite in this manner .",
    "@xcite as a first approximation and in view of the strength of the graphene bonds , initially we used the dft code to only relax the distance of lithium atoms from the graphene plane , keeping the coordinates of carbon atoms fixed .",
    "this yielded a distance of @xmath18    between the lithium layer and graphene , which is a somewhat smaller value , as expected for the lda , than that obtained in other theoretical calculations based on generalized - gradient approximation ( gga ) .",
    "@xcite in our tight - binding model presented in the sec .",
    "[ tbm ] we use the data obtained for this structure",
    ". however , since a change in the bond lengths has an important implication for opening a band gap , we then used the code to relax the positions of the carbon atoms as well as the position of lithium atoms .",
    "this indeed resulted in a tiny kekul distortion of c - c bond lengths , so that the near bonds to li were contracted by @xmath19   , and the far bonds to li were stretched by @xmath20   .",
    "we then made band structure and dos calculations for c@xmath1li .",
    "for repeated images of the systems , we used supercells , with @xmath21    for graphene , and @xmath22  for c@xmath1li .",
    "a kinetic - energy cutoff of 70  ry was needed for total - energy convergence .",
    "brillouin - zone ( bz ) integrations were made with a @xmath23 monkhorst - pack sampling of @xmath24-space , @xcite with gaussian smearing of 0.05  ry . for the calculation of the dos we used the tetrahedron method @xcite with a finer @xmath24-point mesh of @xmath25 grid .    , i.e. , graphene described by the unit cell of @xmath0 structure .",
    "( b ) band structure of c@xmath1li .",
    "a band gap has opened at the neutrality point , the degenerate bands along the @xmath26-@xmath27 direction are split , and a small band gap has opened at @xmath27 near the bottom of the figure .",
    "horizontal dashed lines indicate the fermi levels of the respective systems.,width=321 ]    the band structures of c@xmath1li , with unrelaxed carbon atom positions , and c@xmath28 , i.e. , graphene described with the unit cell of c@xmath1li , are compared in fig .",
    "we note the fourfold degeneracy of the bands at @xmath26 , at the fermi level ( dirac or neutrality point ) , in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , which is due to the folding of @xmath27 and @xmath29 points of the graphene bz onto @xmath26 in the bz for c@xmath28 structure",
    ". we also note the linear dispersion of the energy bands in the neighborhood of the dirac point . in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) , we see a number of changes that appear in the band structure of c@xmath1li . of interest for our study is the gap opening of @xmath30  ev at the neutrality point . for the c@xmath1li with fully relaxed positions ,",
    "including those of carbon atoms , the gap opening is @xmath31  ev , and otherwise the band structure is quite similar to the unrelaxed case .",
    "this means that the change in c - c bond lengths is responsible for only about 5% of the band gap .",
    "we also note the lifting of other degeneracies , at @xmath27 and along the @xmath26-@xmath27 direction .",
    "other changes that can be readily noted , as a result of lithium adsorption , include the appearance of the parabolic - shaped band of lithium , with its minimum located at @xmath26 , at 0.92  ev above the neutrality point .",
    "the lithium band weakly hybridizes with the graphene conduction bands , resulting in some shifts and kinks in the bands of graphene .",
    "there is a substantial charge transfer of @xmath32 per li atom from lithium layer to graphene , with every carbon atom receiving the same charge of one - sixth of this value , i.e. , @xmath33 . as a result",
    ", the fermi level is raised by @xmath34  ev relative to the neutrality point of graphene .",
    "a rigid band model is clearly not a complete description , but it can be used to describe the charge transfer , which is another important aspect of this problem .",
    "the band gap of c@xmath1li is a consequence of the special relationship between its structure and that of the graphene substrate .",
    "the bravais lattice of c@xmath1li is hexagonal , as it is for graphene , but with a @xmath35 times larger lattice parameter and rotated by @xmath36 , as shown in fig .",
    "it is convenient to describe the base vectors of the hexagonal lattice in a standard way , with the lattice parameter used as unit of length , so for c@xmath1li we use the coordinate system with its @xmath3-axis taken along @xmath37 in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , @xmath38 where @xmath39 .",
    "[ thus the same base vectors [ eq .  ( [ base ] ) ]",

    "[ fig2 ] , with @xmath42 and with the @xmath3 axis taken along @xmath40 . ]",
    "the corresponding reciprocal - lattice vectors of the hexagonal lattice are @xmath43 we denote the reciprocal - lattice vectors of graphene , which are also given by eq .",
    "( [ reciprocal ] ) relative to its own system , by @xmath44 .",
    "the two sets of vectors @xmath45 and @xmath44 are related by a @xmath36 rotation and a @xmath35 change in scale , i.e. , @xmath46 .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the @xmath27 points of graphene are located at @xmath47 i.e. , the @xmath27 points of graphene coincide with reciprocal - lattice points of c@xmath28",
    ". it also follows from eq .",
    "( [ kk ] ) that the @xmath27 points of graphene belong to the reciprocal lattice of the @xmath14 structure .",
    "evidently , @xmath48 and @xmath49 constructions , with @xmath50 a positive integer , will also share this property .",
    "the existence of this kind of relationship is the basic reason why a gap opens in c@xmath2 if @xmath3 is a multiple of 3 , since in these structures the @xmath27 points of the underlying graphene become coupled and the perturbation caused by the foreign atoms removes the degeneracy .",
    "the wave functions with wave vectors corresponding to @xmath27 and @xmath29 of graphene mix to form different standing waves .",
    "one standing wave piles up electronic charge in hexagonal cells occupied by li , and depletes it from the hexagonal cells devoid of li , and the other standing wave does the opposite .",
    "( the commensurate structure of c@xmath1li breaks a @xmath51 symmetry . )",
    "these standing wave states then experience different potentials which qualitatively explains the origin of the gap .",
    "each carbon atom of sublattice @xmath52 is connected to three carbon atoms of sublattice @xmath53 by the @xmath54 vectors , as shown in fig .",
    "these vectors in the coordinate system of c@xmath1li , needed in our tight - binding calculations , are given by @xmath55    li .",
    "carbon atoms on sublattices @xmath52 and @xmath53 are depicted as filled and open black circles .",

    "the @xmath36 rotated rhombus , defined by @xmath37 and @xmath58 and having @xmath35 times larger side , is the unit cell of c@xmath1li . in the upper left part are shown the vectors pointing from a carbon atom on sublattice @xmath52 to its three nearest neighbors on sublattice @xmath53 .",
    "the inset shows the reciprocal space .",
    "the vectors @xmath45 and @xmath44 are sets of reciprocal lattice vectors of c@xmath1li and graphene , respectively .",
    "the hexagons in the inset are the brillouin zones .",
    "the region defined by @xmath59 is the irreducible wedge of graphene brillouin zone.,width=321 ]    we now examine the system from the viewpoint of the tight - binding model .",
    "the presence of the lithium atoms , in c@xmath1li , above the hollow hexagonal sites can be imagined to have two effects , within a simple tight - binding model : ( a ) a contribution ( hartree potential ) to the on - site energies of the c atoms , and ( b ) a possible change in the hopping amplitudes depicted as c - c bonds in fig .  [ fig2 ] . from an inspection of the wigner - seitz cell in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the c atoms are seen to occupy equivalent positions with respect to the metal atoms since each is at a vertex shared by one metal - filled and two empty hexagons of the honeycomb lattice .",
    "therefore all c atoms receive the same charge transfer from li atoms , as we have also seen in our dft calculations , and the symmetry breaking can not be attributed to on - site energies .",
    "this reduces the number of parameters and makes a tb model description much simpler for c@xmath1li than for more dispersed compounds .",
    "the bonds , however , occupy two kinds of positions in a kekul construction , two - thirds of them ( colored red ) between a filled and an empty hexagon , and one - third ( colored blue ) between two empty hexagons .",
    "we conclude that there are two different hopping amplitudes corresponding to the two kinds of bond positions .",
    "our dft calculations showed that changes in bond - length account for @xmath60% of the energy gap .",
    "the modulation in hopping amplitudes , which are matrix elements of the hamiltonian between carbon @xmath61 orbitals , is therefore caused mainly by different potential energies and electron concentrations in the regions of red and blue bonds , with a small contribution due to bond - length distortion .",
    "of course , both variations in potential energy and the distortion of bond lengths are caused by the presence of lithium ions , and their effects on the band gap add with each other .",
    "the @xmath62 bands of graphene are described well by a hamiltonian of spinless electrons hopping on the honeycomb lattice of graphene , @xmath63 here @xmath64 annihilates ( creates ) an electron at site @xmath65 , @xmath66 are on - site energies , which are all equal and therefore can be set to zero , and @xmath67 are the hopping amplitudes .",
    "the nearest - neighbor tb model of graphene has a gapless band structure , but a kekul modulation of the hopping amplitudes couples the @xmath27 and @xmath29 points , leading to a mixing of degenerate states and opening of an energy band gap .",
    "@xcite following our discussion above , we allow the hopping amplitudes @xmath67 to have two values , @xmath68 for two - thirds of the bonds on the hexagonal cells beneath a metal atom , and @xmath69 for the remaining one - third of the bonds . here",
    "we are interested in describing the gap , and therefore we exclude the metal atoms from our tb model , except for their effect on modulating the hopping amplitudes . they can be included in a more general treatment , @xcite but this is not needed for describing the gap of c@xmath1li .    for clean graphene @xmath70 .",
    "there are two @xmath62 bands corresponding to the two - atom basis , and the band energy can be written as @xmath71 where the vectors @xmath72 are defined in fig .",
    "when we use the unit cell of the @xmath0 superlattice to describe graphene , we will have six @xmath62 bands since there are six carbon atoms within this unit cell .",

    "we found that the value of @xmath79 is slightly larger for the upper branch than that for the lower branch , by @xmath87  ev , but that the change in the average value is much smaller than this amount . in the following ,",
    "we neglect the renormalization of the fermi velocity and the average hopping amplitude .",
