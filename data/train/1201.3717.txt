    "there were many trials to solve the model called ( in quantum optics ) rabi hamiltonian exactly , until braak @xcite recently succeeded to do so .",
    "the same model is known under several pseudonyms , e. g. single - mode spin - boson system , jaynes - cummings model without rotating wave approximation and others ; a brief survey can be found in @xcite .",
    "let us introduce a more general form of rabi hamiltonians @xcite , describing the interaction between a bosonic mode with energy @xmath2 and a two - level atom with level spacing @xmath3 @xmath4,\\ ] ] where @xmath5 ; @xmath6 is the interaction constant , @xmath7 , @xmath8 are the pauli matrices , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are boson creation and annihilation operators , respectively . for the most studied @xmath11 case braak @xcite",
    "recently presented an exact algebraic solution ; we are going to solve the @xmath12 model in full analogy .",
    "before braak s general solution , some special points , called also the juddian ones , were known to be exactly solvable .",
    "this means that for some constraints on the hamiltonian parameters , one can find both an eigenfunction and its eigenenergy .",
    "it does nt give the complete spectrum , just one excited eigenstate .",
    "this was shown at first for the standard @xmath11 rabi hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "later the same picture , of course with different constraints and eigenvalues was shown for @xmath12 , i. e. the two - photon rabi hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "these special points manifest themselves as cross - sections of general solutions and they will serve as a check of our results .    it is also known that the parameters of the two - photon rabi model are restricted by @xmath13 , otherwise the eigenfunctions are not normalizable @xcite .",
    "the first step of the solution is going over to bargmann space @xcite , introducing complex variable @xmath14 , where the bosonic operators simplify to    [ e2 ] b , b^z .    the eigenfunctions have to be analytic in the whole complex plane .",
    "let us suppose that the solution of the stationary schrdinger equation is a vector composed of two analytic functions @xmath15 .",
    "we can insert eq.([e2 ] ) into the hamiltonian ( [ e1 ] ) , case @xmath12 , and using the well - known @xmath16 pauli matrices , we obtain a coupled system of second - order differential equations    @xmath17    where @xmath18 means the derivative with respect to @xmath14 and @xmath19 is the energy from the hamiltonian s spectrum . for better symmetrization it is useful to go over to a linear combination of the considered functions , namely @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "thus we get the set    @xmath22    the next step is to find important symmetries present in the set ( [ e4 ] ) before they become less clear after some transformation followed by a series expansion . here",
    "we prefer a somewhat different way than braak @xcite , but a very obvious one .",
    "we will perform two transformations of the variable @xmath14 .",
    "the first one is @xmath23 .",
    "one can easily see , that it leaves the set ( [ e4 ] ) unchanged .",
    "simple inspection shows , that this implies common parity of both @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "plainly speaking , they must be either both even    @xmath26    or alternatively , simultaneously odd    @xmath27    the second applied transformation is @xmath28 .",
    "the set ( [ e4 ] ) becomes    @xmath29    now the functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 evidently swapped their places , thus up to some common multiplicative constant :    @xmath30    possible values of the parameter @xmath31 can be found by inserting @xmath32 instead of @xmath14 and we get @xmath33 and analogously @xmath34 . hence @xmath35 from eq.([e5 ] ) or @xmath36 from eq.([e6 ] ) .",
    "the symmetry parameter can acquire four values , @xmath37 . in the standard @xmath11 rabi model such parameter had only two values @xmath1 and",
    "the transformation @xmath38 was sufficient .",
    "finally let us introduce four functions @xmath39 whose roots with respect to @xmath19 will be used to fulfill eq.([e8 ] ) :    @xmath40    in the last two cases the lower of eqs.([e8 ] ) was multiplied by @xmath41 in order to keep the @xmath42 functions real .",
    "they share the common parity of their @xmath43 functions .",
    "the upper of eqs.([e8 ] ) is then no more independent .",
    "the complete discrete spectra will be given by all roots of all @xmath39 functions , again in full analogy with the standard rabi model @xcite .",
    "of course , the roots are meant with respect to @xmath19 and they are independent of any chosen @xmath14 .    having categorized the symmetries , we return to the set ( [ e4 ] ) and perform the transformation @xmath44 .",
    "we get    @xmath45    where we used the parameter @xmath46 to simplify the first equation by removing the term @xmath47 , thus specifying its value    [ e11 ] = .",
    "in fact there should be @xmath48 in front of the square root , but the plus sign would make @xmath46 divergent in the limit @xmath49 , which is physically not reasonable .",
    "notice that @xmath46 remains real under the above mentioned restriction @xmath50 .",
    "there is also a further analogy with the standard rabi model , where the special case @xmath51 is exactly solved with help of the coherent state @xmath52 , here @xmath53 is the lowest bosonic state @xcite . in our notation , braak performs the transformation @xmath54 , recall @xmath55 in ( [ e2 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath12 rabi hamiltonian solution at @xmath51 involves the squeezed vacuum @xcite term @xmath56 .",
    "we will return to this case later .    in the next step",
    "we expand the functions @xmath57 :    @xmath58    to keep the solutions analytic we expect @xmath59 for @xmath60 @xcite . inserting these expressions into eqs.([e10 ] ) we get the iteration scheme    @xmath61q_n \\nonumber\\\\ + \\frac{\\omega_0}{2}k_n= 0   \\nonumber \\\\",
    "-2g(n+2)(n+1)k_{n+2 } + [ ( \\omega+8g\\kappa)n+4g\\kappa - e]k_n \\nonumber\\\\ - 4\\omega\\kappa k_{n-2}+\\frac{\\omega_0}{2}q_n = 0.\\ \\ \\ \\ \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    notice that the indexes differ by 0 , 2 or 4 , thus only the coefficients @xmath62 @xmath63 with common parity will be non - zero , either for even @xmath64 , eq.([e5 ] ) , or odd @xmath65 , eq.([e6 ] ) . the prefactor @xmath66 does nt spoil the parity .",
    "the starting point of our iteration scheme is either at @xmath67 or @xmath68 .",
    "let us first have a look on the case @xmath67 and the symmetry parameter @xmath69 .",
    "upper eq.([e8 ] ) @xmath70 at @xmath71 implies @xmath72 , which can itself be a function of hamiltonian parameters , serving as normalization constant for the eigenfunctions .",
    "but as we are interested only in the roots of @xmath73 , this constant becomes an unimportant multiplication factor and we can choose    [ e14 ] q_0=1,k_0=1 .",
    "the second case is @xmath74 .",
    "we have @xmath75 and again at @xmath71    [ e15 ] q_0=1,k_0=-1 .",
    "the third case with @xmath76 is only a bit more complicated .",
    "the symmetry condition from eq.([e8 ] ) is now @xmath77 and its value at @xmath71 is rather trivial @xmath78 .",
    "but we will compare the first derivatives w. r. t. @xmath14 , i. e. @xmath79 at @xmath71 and we get @xmath80 , thus now our starting point is    [ e16 ] q_1=1,k_1=1 .    at last for @xmath81",
    "we get    [ e17 ] q_1=1,k_1=-1 .    concluding this part",
    "we can see that the hilbert space of eigenfunctions splits into four disjunct subspaces .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalues can be found separately as roots of four @xmath82 functions , eq.([e9 ] ) .",
    "we substitute @xmath83 , the coefficients of expanded @xmath57 functions are found applying the iteration scheme ( [ e13 ] ) subsequently with four starting points , eqs.([e14]-[e17 ] ) .",
    "the coefficients not defined by eq.([e13 ] ) are zero because of parity demands .",
    "@xmath84 as well .",
    "before proceeding to numerical calculations , we ought to mention several special cases , where the exact solution was already known .",
    "they will serve as a check of our general solution .",
    "if the interaction constant is zero , the system separates into independent two - state atom with energy levels @xmath86 and a phonon with the modes @xmath87 , where @xmath88 thus the overall energy is @xmath89 .",
    "it is instructive to see how these values split into four groups as roots of four @xmath42 functions .",
    "therefore we will solve this simple case explicitly .",
    "we return to the original functions @xmath90 , as the set of equations ( [ e3 ] ) decouples for @xmath85 and the two independent solutions are found easily    @xmath91    where we denoted the exponents by @xmath92 and @xmath93 , as the parity conditions ( [ e5 ] ) and ( [ e6 ] ) are common for @xmath43 and @xmath90 functions .",
    "they force @xmath92 and @xmath93 to be integer and the analyticity demands make them non - negative . the energies @xmath94 and @xmath95 should be common , but they are generally different , thus the overall solutions will have either @xmath96 or @xmath97 .",
    "let us first analyze the case @xmath98 with the energy @xmath94 .",
    "the linear combinations @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "the solutions for the functions @xmath101 finally yield    @xmath102    the second solution @xmath103 with @xmath104 and eigenenergies @xmath95 gives    @xmath105    we will later analyze mainly the cases when @xmath3 and @xmath2 are comparable and the eigenenergies as roots of @xmath42 functions reorganize as follows :    @xmath106    we can see that real values of the symmetry parameter @xmath31 are connected with even number of phonon excitations @xmath107 whereas the imaginary @xmath31 is coupled to odd @xmath107 . the global ground state is always given by the lowest root of @xmath108 , which is true also for non - zero @xmath6 .",
    "if the gap @xmath3 between atomic levels disappears , all eigenenergies become twice degenerate .",
    "they are exactly known and now the complete spectrum is given by @xcite    [ e22 ] e=-+(n+)n=0,1,2,  where another dimensionless quantity was introduced = = 1- .",
    "let us reproduce this result .",
    "we return to the @xmath43 functions , because now the system of equations ( [ e4 ] ) decouples for @xmath51 and the general solutions are    @xmath110 .",

    "it is nothing else but eq.([e22 ] ) reversed .",
    "thus if the parity demands force @xmath114 to be non - negative integer again , the spectrum is reproduced .",
    "let us show it in detail at least for the simpler case of @xmath114 even .",
    "we make use of a formula relating hermitian polynomials and hypergeometric function , valid for @xmath115    = i^n e^-q^2 z^2 _ 1f_1 ( , , q^2 z^2 ) , whereas for any @xmath114 , including non - integer one , the kummer transformation @xcite gives    [ e26 ] _",
    "1f_1(-,,-y)=e^-y _ 1f_1(,,y ) .",
    "first of all we set @xmath116 , because the hermitian polynomial with negative index has no parity , whereas the rest of the solutions ( [ e24 ] ) are even functions for @xmath114 even .",
    "we define @xmath117 , @xmath118 and require @xmath119 using eqs .",
    "( [ e23 ] ) - ( [ e26 ] ) .",
    "we get    [ e27 ] ( -2)^n/2(n-1)!!c_12+c_22c_21 = 0 . for @xmath114 non - integer ( or odd integer ) , the term with the hermitian polynomial would become complex , but our functions @xmath120 and @xmath121 are real - hence we set also @xmath122 .",
    "we already mentioned that one parameter can be chosen , say the integration constant @xmath123 .",
    "thus @xmath124 and the two @xmath42 functions are identical , @xmath125 .",
    "one can compare the series expansion of these @xmath126 solutions with those given by the scheme ( [ e13 ] ) , starting points ( [ e14 ] ) or ( [ e15 ] ) and see that in fact we managed to perform the complete sum of eqs .",
    "( [ e12 ] ) .    having exact formulas for some @xmath43 and @xmath39 functions at disposal allows us to make several observations . in the on - line supplement to ref .",
    "@xcite , braak reports some problems with the radius of convergence @xmath127 of his series in @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath127 seemed to be finite in some cases , though analyticity in the whole complex plane of @xmath14 is required . to keep the series analogous to our eqs.([e12 ] ) convergent , as a necessary condition , the ratio @xmath128 had to go to zero for @xmath129 .",
    "if it was non - zero , @xmath127 became finite .",
    "for the special case @xmath51 we can calculate this ratio explicitly .",
    "the coefficients @xmath130 with @xmath131 become rather simple    [ e28 ] q_2k=(e-_2k-2)(e-_2k-4 )  ( e-_0 ) , where @xmath132 are eigenenergies from eq.([e22 ] ) .",
    "en route we see that the energy @xmath133 terminates @xmath134 to a ( hermite ) polynomial .",
    "the ratio    [ e29 ] q_2k+2/q_2k-0,kas required .",
    "the equations for @xmath135 are not so simple , thus we resort to the exact solution of @xmath25 and find    [ e30 ] k_2k+2/k_2k0,k . for @xmath114 odd and",
    "especially for non - zero @xmath3 we performed at least numerical study of @xmath63 , @xmath130 from the scheme ( [ e13 ] ) and found that their ratios are also proportional to @xmath136 in leading term .",
    "hence we experience no problems with analyticity of the expanded functions including even very large @xmath14 .",
    "the next remark concerns the practical numerical calculations of the roots @xmath137 , independent of @xmath14 .",
    "it turns out that such calculations are numerically more stable for large @xmath14 , which is allowed by the previous notion .",
    "one can exploit the large-@xmath14 asymptotic for the @xmath138 contribution to @xmath121 given by @xcite    _ 1f_1(a , b , y)=e^y y^a - by0 , which is analytic for non - negative integer power @xmath139 , i. e. @xmath140 as expected .",
    "@xmath120 gives the same after kummer transformation ( [ e26 ] ) .",
    "further we return to the complete spectrum in eq.([e22 ] ) .",
    "for @xmath141 the quantity @xmath142 and the energy becomes infinitely many times degenerate .",
    "this point is physically unsound , though well defined in the sense of a limit .",
    "concluding , the eigenvalue of eq.([e22 ] ) for @xmath67 coincides with mutually equal lowest roots of @xmath108 and @xmath143 , for @xmath68 it is the lowest root of both @xmath144 and @xmath145 , for @xmath146 the second lowest root of both @xmath108 and @xmath143 , etc .",
    "let us now recall the result of emary and bishop @xcite , who found a set of isolated solutions for our model .",
    "we are not going to rederive it , but the basic fact is that under some constraint on hamiltonian s parameters and energy @xmath19 , at least one of the original eigenfunctions @xmath90 becomes a product of some exponential function and of a polynomial .",
    "the main statement is that there exist exactly known eigenstates with eigenenergies    @xmath148    if the following conditions are fulfilled    @xmath149    etc .",
    "we will proceed so that we choose the values of @xmath3 and @xmath2 , than we gradually change @xmath6 .",
    "eq.([e32 ] ) yields value(s ) of @xmath6 and followingly the energy is got from eq.([e31 ] ) .",
    "these solutions will manifest themselves as crossing points of appropriate roots of @xmath108 and @xmath143 in the case of @xmath107 even , or crossings of @xmath144 and @xmath145 roots in the case of @xmath107 odd .",
    "this is again analogous with the standard @xmath11 rabi model , where the juddian points appeared as crossings of the roots of @xmath150 and @xmath151 @xcite .",
    "recall that contrary to eq .",
    "( [ e22 ] ) , this is only one known excited state for chosen set of hamiltonian parameters , not the complete spectrum .",
    "[ t ] eigenenergies as roots of @xmath82 functions for @xmath51 and @xmath152 .",
    "full lines are exact values.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "the resulting energies as roots of @xmath42 functions should not depend on @xmath14 ; this would be true after summing infinite number of summands in eq.([e12 ] ) . in numerical calculations",
    "we truncate the sum and hope that the higher powers are not significant .",
    "we can not use very small @xmath14 , because of numerical instability .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , we can use as large values as @xmath153 or even @xmath154 without real change of the roots .",
    "this fact was already noted for exactly solvable cases , nevertheless one even does nt have to use compromise medium values despite of the truncated expansions . using the symbolic program mathematica",
    ", we could sum up to @xmath155 term with @xmath156 for even solutions or @xmath157 for the odd ones . if the values of a root with smaller @xmath158 converged to the same value , we accept it .",
    "it turns out that for smaller values of @xmath159 the convergence is excellent , but it becomes poorer as we approach the maximal possible value , i. e. if @xmath160 . the interval of @xmath6 in our plots is limited to @xmath161 .",
    "it is known that although the eigenfunctions differ after changing the sign of @xmath6 , the eigenenergies remain the same , i. e. there is a mirror symmetry @xmath162 .",
    "let us test our calculations at first on the exactly solved case @xmath51 .",
    "we choose @xmath152 .",
    "parts of parabolas with common top form the exact spectrum from eq .",
    "( [ e22 ] ) , see full lines in fig .",
    "it is clear , that in the vicinity of the infinitely many times degenerate point with @xmath163 , the roots of @xmath82 functions become very dense and the functions themselves are quickly oscillating .",
    "that is the reason , why even for the orders as large as @xmath156 the values of appropriate roots did not converge completely and we have to resort to some fitting procedure , yielding better guess of the saturation value for @xmath164 .",
    "the roots are denoted so that the lowest one is @xmath165 , the second lowest one @xmath166 , etc .",
    "we can see that the calculated eigenenergies fit the exact values almost perfectly , except for some deviation at @xmath6 close to @xmath167 and for the higher root , in this case @xmath168 .",
    "[ t ]     functions for @xmath169 and @xmath170 . ]    in fig .",
    "2 we present three lowest roots of @xmath171 , full symbols , and two lowest roots of @xmath172 , smaller empty symbols . the values @xmath169 and @xmath170 are chosen so that the spectrum at @xmath85 becomes equidistant , see eq.([e21 ] ) .",
    "the large empty circles are exact solutions of eqs.([e32 ] ) and ( [ e31 ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath107 is written nearby .",
    "we can see almost perfect match with the crossings of appropriate lines .",
    "the bottom four lines with @xmath173 and @xmath174 do not cross ; lines with @xmath175 cross twice .",
    "3 shows the same roots denoted by the same symbols as fig.2 , just for @xmath176 and @xmath152 . besides the well fitted exact crossing points , there are other crossings of lines with different @xmath107 , which are not exactly known .",
    "a similar figure with in fact the same hamiltonian parameters was already published @xcite , where the authors plot also numerical results from larger matrices diagonalization .",
    "there is a couple of simpler analytic results , that can be got from our approach .",
    "so we can find e. g. the small-@xmath6 expansion of the ( global ) ground state energy @xmath177 :    e_0 - -+o(g^4 ) , g,_0 which can be compared with similar result for the @xmath11 rabi model : @xmath178 @xcite .",

    "@xcite , e. solano states that braak @xcite managed to enlarge the class of exactly solvable models and that he added the standard rabi model on the short list of exactly solvable quantum systems .",
    "we believe that this paper adds also the two - photon rabi hamiltonian on the same list .",
    "this list can almost surely be extended further by using braak s approach on other related models and yet another task for future is deeper understanding of the criteria of its applicability .",
