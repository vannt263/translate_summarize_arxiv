    "the overlapping of nonlinear resonances is the criterion for the origin of dynamical stochasticity in classical hamiltonian systems . at realization of the condition of this criterion it is possible to justify the transition from the dynamic hamilton description to the statistical one and to study the behavior of the system with the help of statistical average .",
    "such description is as full as possible in this range and successfully substitutes dynamic description which loses its sense due to strong local instability @xcite .",
    "however in the quantum mechanics the introduction of a stochasticity is significantly difficult @xcite . what can be considered as quantum analog of dynamic stochasticity ,",
    "what is a criterion for passing to quantum chaos , how to quantize the system in classical limit corresponding to the dynamic stochasticity ?",
    "there are only some problems of quantum chaos .    in the given work the attempt is made to investigate two aspects of a general problem of quantum chaos : the criterion for the overlapping of resonances on the basis of quantum mechanics and to study the singularities of wave functions in the area , in which the classic mechanics assumes the existence of dynamic stochasticity .",
    "let us assume , that nonlinearly oscillating particle ( fig .",
    "1 ) is under the action of variable field @xmath4 where @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10    the hamiltonian of such type for a long time is being investigated with the purpose of study of a dynamic stochasticity both in classical @xcite , and in quantum systems @xcite .    here",
    "@xmath11 and @xmath12 are the coordinate and the impulse of the particle , @xmath13 is the fundamental frequency,@xmath14 and @xmath15 are the coefficients of the nonlinearity,@xmath16 and @xmath17 are the mass and the charge of the particle,@xmath18 is the amplitude of the variable field , @xmath19 is the periodic sequence of rectangular electromagnetic impulses with the duration @xmath20 and with the phase of recurring @xmath21 ( fig.2,fig.3 ) .",
    "it is supposed , that @xmath22    the fundamental component of pumping field at frequency @xmath23 is able to carry out the linear resonance and cause the increase of @xmath11 until the nonlinear terms proportional to @xmath24 and @xmath25 become significant in the potential ( i.e. up to a neighborhood of @xmath26 , fig .",
    "1 ) . from this moment",
    "the nonlinear terms will gradually begin to detune the linear resonance ( at @xmath27 ) , that will reduce the resonance growth of @xmath11 .",
    "then the remaining harmonics of the pumping spectrum , concentrated in sum @xmath19 , will begin to play the role",
    ". their role will be significant in reaching higher excitation @xmath28 , if criteria of the overlapping of resonances is fulfilled .",
    "in this paragraph we shall review the well - known results obtained in the theory of a stochasticity for the nonlinearly oscillating classical systems . after passing in the hamiltonian ( 1 ) to the variables action - angle with help of transformation @xmath29 , and averaging ( 1 ) with respect to the fast phase @xmath30",
    ", we obtain : @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the slow phase .",
    "let us notice , that @xmath36 we have united with @xmath37 in unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath38 . in the further nonlinear terms are not assumed small and the application for them of the perturbation theory is not possible .",
    "the relevant set of canonical equation looks like : @xmath39 @xmath40 where @xmath41 @xmath42    the phase @xmath43 , slow as compared to the @xmath44 remains fast in the comparison with the velocity of the action @xmath45 variation .",
    "the velocity of the variation of @xmath43 contains information about the nonlinear character of motion .",
    "in particular , the dependence of @xmath46 from @xmath45 means the presence of nonlinearity in the oscillating system .",
    "suppose that for some values of the @xmath47 the resonance between @xmath48 and some component from the polychromatic pumping spectrum ( 5 ) ( i.e. @xmath49 ) is carried out . then forming a slow phase @xmath50 , averaging expression ( 5 ) with respect to the fast @xmath43 and taking into account ( 5 ) , we get : @xmath51    substituting ( 6 ) in ( 4 ) , we have : @xmath52 @xmath53 where @xmath54    equations ( 7 ) describe the nonlinear resonance . as opposite to the linear resonance at which unbounded linear growth of",
    "an amplitude is valid ( in our case action @xmath45 or deviation @xmath11 ) , in the case of the nonlinear resonance ( as it was already mentioned ) , there are so - called `` phase oscillations '' , i.e. oscillation of the phase @xmath55 and the amplitude @xmath47 .",
    "let us introduce the deviation of the action , @xmath56 , @xmath57 from the resonance value .",
    "then it is possible to demonstrate that the hamiltonian @xmath58 where @xmath59 = @xmath60 , produces the set of equations of ( 7 ) type .",
    "really , from the equilibrium conditions , @xmath61 , one can obtain :    @xmath62    @xmath63 if the condition of moderate nonlinearity is just @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the factor of nonlinearity , then with the help of ( 7)-(11 ) , we get @xmath66    it is possible to obtain the equation @xmath67 for phase oscillations from the set ( 12 ) @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the frequency of phase oscillations .",
    "let us notice , that the hamiltonian ( 9 ) is the hamiltonian of the mathematical pendulum , where the role of the mass plays @xmath70 and the role of the potential energy - @xmath71 .",
    "taking into account that in the classical mechanics the problem of the pendulum can be solved exactly we reduced an initial problem to the solved one .",
    "variation of the action with the help of ( 9 ) and ( 12 ) can be presented in the form : @xmath72 ( with the period equal to @xmath73 ) , @xmath74 ( with the period equal to @xmath75 ) , where @xmath76 is the energy of the particle , @xmath77 and @xmath78 are jacobian elliptic functions : the elliptic cosine and delta of amplitude ; @xmath79 is the second order complete elliptic integral , @xmath80 is the module of elliptic integrals . @xmath81 and @xmath82 are deviations of the action up and below the separatrix accordingly . for @xmath83",
    "these two solutions are sewed together and take the form of an instanton @xmath84    averaging the action deviation with respect to half period we get the following equations : @xmath85 @xmath86 @xmath87 @xmath88 @xmath89 .    at @xmath90 @xmath91    action variation dependence on the ratio @xmath92 is presented on the fig.4 .    according to fig.4",
    ", the magnitude of @xmath82 sharply decreases with approaching to a separatrix .",
    "if during the phase oscillation @xmath93 takes enough major values ( such as @xmath94 ) , the resonance condition @xmath95 breakes , but other resonance condition is attuned : @xmath96    just at the jump to the other resonance condition there is an abruptness , which results in a stochastic wandering of spectral harmonics ( 6 ) .",
    "it is the essence of overlapping of resonances , which serves as the criterion of the stochasticity emerging in the nonlinearly oscillating system . expending @xmath97 into series with respect to @xmath98 and making an estimation , @xmath99 , on the bases of ( 17 ) and ( 18 )",
    ", it is possible to present the condition ( 20 ) in the form @xmath100 .",
    "thus , in the case of overlapping of resonances the phase oscillations frequency - @xmath101 , coincides by an order of magnitude with the frequency distance between harmonics in the pumping spectrum .",
    "usually criterion of the dynamic stochasticity , equivalent to the overlapping of resonances , is written down by introducing the stochasticity coefficient @xmath102    in the range of statistical motion the nonlinear oscillating system is described with the help of distribution function @xmath103 , for which it is possible to obtain the diffusion equation @xcite @xmath104 where @xmath105 is a diffusion coefficient .",
    "now from ( 22 ) with the help of @xmath106 it is easy to get @xmath107 , where average is understood as a statistical average .",
    "diffusion growth of the action reduces the growth of @xmath108 in the range of @xmath109 . as an energy of the particle , located in a hole ,",
    "is @xmath110 , then in the range of stochastic dynamics @xmath111=@xmath112 and  heating  of the particle takes the place .",
    "the above - mentioned reasonings are proved by numerical calculations ( fig .",
    "the first numerical experiments for stochastic `` heating '' of a nonlinear oscillator were carried out long time ago , see @xcite .",
    "the condition of resonances overlapping has visual interpretation on a phase plane .",
    "the mathematical pendulum , in an association with initial conditions , can make two types of motion : oscillatory and rotary .",
    "they are separated by a separatrix on the phase diagram .",
    "the overlapping of resonances on the phase plane corresponds to a touch of separatrixes ( fig .",
    "6 ) , if the width of the separatrix is estimated as @xmath113 ( in frequency units ) .",
    "the dynamic stochasticity usually originates in a narrow layer near to a separatrix @xcite .",
    "therefore , at quantum reviewing we shall be especially interested in quantum properties of the system near to the separatrix .",
    "in other words , we shall be interested in a wave function of isolated nonlinear resonance in the absence of overlapping .",
    "the analysis of these properties can explain essence of a quantum chaos .",
    "in conclusion of this paragraph we shall remark , that the condition of overlapping of resonances depends on the action @xmath114 as the solution of the equations generated by the universal hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , at quantum reviewing , for establishment the criterion of overlapping of resonances it is enough in ( 20 ) under @xmath114 to understand the relevant magnitude obtained from the quantum equations generated by the hamiltonian ( 9 ) .    except the quantum estimation for @xmath115 we shall be interested also in quantum dynamics near to the separatrix @xmath116 , as the basis of directed random motion in one - dimensional nonlinear systems .",
    "the quantummechanical consideration of isolated nonlinear resonance , as well as overlapping of two resonances was presented in @xcite.in @xcite it was specified , that the schrodinger equation for a nonlinear isolated resonance can be reduced to the mathieu s equation , and if the condition of the resonances overlapping is fulfilled the correlations drop @xcite ( numerical computational methods ) .",
    "we in this paragraph are interested essentially in quantummechanical characteristics of the problem - wave function and energy spectrum .",
    "we shall investigate , how can at quantum case the unpredictability of hit of a system in any quantum state ( analog of a stochastic stratum near a separatrix in classical mechanics ) .",
    "the universal hamiltonian ( 9 ) depends on the basic parameter of nonlinear oscillations , @xmath59 . at quantum reviewing corresponding to the universal hamiltonian schrodinger equation will be also depending on @xmath117 .",
    "so we came to the quantum - mechanical consideration of the nonlinear - oscillating system within the frame of approximation made in  1 .",
    "let us clarify essence of the parameter @xmath120 .",
    "the value @xmath121 is the quantum ( the minimal portion ) of the frequency shift stipulated by nonlinearity ( i.e. , the frequency quantum of nonlinearity ) .",
    "hence , value @xmath122 is the energy quantum of nonlinearity .    the equation ( 23 ) is the mathieu s equation which analysis we shall make below .",
    "for now we want to get quasi - classical wave functions relevant to an approximation @xmath123 of the schrodinger equation .",
    "it is known , that quasi - classical wave function is : @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the normalizing constant and @xmath115 can be find from the integral of the energy @xmath126    substituting ( 24 ) in ( 23 ) , after integration we get : @xmath127 @xmath128 @xmath129\\biggr ) } { ( e+u\\cos \\alpha ) ^{1/4 } } , \\\\\\ ] ] @xmath130 @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the elliptic  integral of the first kind,@xmath133 is the elliptic integral of the second kind and @xmath134 is the first kind complete elliptic integral .",
    "let s note , that as in the considered case @xmath135 quasi - classical wave functions ( 26 ) and ( 27 ) oscillate fast with the variation of @xmath136 , having peaks at turning points @xmath137 .",
    "it is a common property of wave functions in a quasi - classical approximation .      according to expression ( 29 ) for",
    "a wave function near the separatrix the frequiency of fast oscillations practically does not vary .",
    "the turning points @xmath141 approach to @xmath142 and the peaks of fast oscillations become negligible low .",
    "this is connected with the logaritmically diverging factor in ( 29 ) . with the help of (",
    "29)it is easy to find an equation for nodal points of separatrix wave function , @xmath143 @xmath144      the high density of nodal points is provided by the major parameter of quasi - classical consideration @xmath146,which is suppressed by the zeroes of the factor @xmath147 in the points @xmath148 ( see fig.7 ) .",
    "another important characteristic of the quantum state near to the separatrix is the density of energy levels .",
    "bohr - zommerfeld quantization condition looks like : @xmath149        in the limit @xmath138 for the energy level density , @xmath153 , we get : @xmath154 for a halfcycle of motion both above and lower of the separatrixes . taking into account ( 25)-(27 ) ,",
    "we obtain : @xmath155      and near the separatrixes , @xmath90 : @xmath157 where @xmath158 denotes averaging which the help of wave functions ( 26 ) , ( 27 ) and ( 29 ) .",
    "let s note , that @xmath159 is in a good agreement with a quasi - classical condition of motion .",
    "because of the coincidence of classical values @xmath160 with the quasi - classical ones @xmath161 it is natural that conditions of overlapping resonances will also coincide @xmath162 . hence , one can conclude that under quasi - classical conditions @xmath163 and the condition of overlapping the resonances the stochastic `` heating '' of electron being under the conditions given in section 1 and the obtaining of high excitations can be carried out(see classical case , fig.5 ) .",
    "quasi - classical expressions ( 36),(37 ) by the form coincide with the similar classical expressions ( 17)and ( 18 ) . but as opposite to the classical formulas , in quasi - classical expressions under @xmath76 should be understood @xmath164 energy spectrum of quasi - classical levels . with the help(33)and ( 34 )",
    "it is possible to determine number of the levels entrapped in a nonlinear resonance : @xmath165 where @xmath166 @xmath167 is the important characteristics of an isolated nonlinear resonance . using ( 34 ) ,",
    "( 37),(39 ) and ( 40)it is easy to show , that the number of levels entrapped in nonlinear resonance is @xmath168 .",
    "according to ( 35 ) , ( 38),(39 ) and ( 40 ) it is also easy to show , that near the separatrix there is @xmath169 . while according to ( 34 ) and ( 35 ) the density of levels increases logarithmically with approaching to the separatrix , the number of levels @xmath167 entrapped in resonance",
    "is not increased .",
    "this is caused by the sharp fall of the action variation near @xmath170 ( see fig.4 ) .",
    "thus the number of entrapped levels in a nonlinear resonance is not great and remains the same when approaching to the separatrix .",
    "major values @xmath167 , as it was shown in @xcite by means of numerical methods , can be reached in case of overlapping resonances .",
    "these functions should satisfy equation @xmath177 which follows from ( 23 ) at @xmath178 .",
    "the equation describes harmonic oscillations with the frequency @xmath179 . to reduce it in the correspondence with the solution ( 41 )",
    "it is necessary to require @xmath180 where @xmath181 .",
    "the last relation leads to the energy spectrum quadratically depending on the quantum number .          using ( 46 ) the condition of the resonances overlapping",
    "could be written as @xmath186 .",
    "it is significantly difficult to fulfill this condition as compared with similar one of quasi - classical case , because it requires excessively small @xmath187 .",
    "it is well known , that eigenvalues of the mathieu s equation can be defined by means of the ince - strutt diagrams ( fig.9 ) constructed for the first time to studying a parametrical resonance @xcite . as follows from these diagrams , each value",
    "@xmath171 corresponds to set of eigenvalues @xmath164 and periodical wave functions @xmath189 .",
    "curvs in fig.9 corresponding to the realized quantum states are known mathieu - characteristics .",
    "essential feature of mathieu - characteristics is the presence of points of branching in the neighbourhood of a line @xmath190 , corresponding to the classical separatrix .",
    "moving along mathieu - characteristics from left to right in points of branching being at the left of separatrix line disappears two - fold degeneration .",
    "so through the passing of separatrix line @xmath190 and reaching the point of branching , to the right of a separatrix wave functions merge again but now - @xmath191 and @xmath192 .",
    "the emergence of such picture ( point of branching from two sides of the separatrix ) at the passage to quantum consideration is a principal characteristic describing a quantum system near classical separatrix .",
    "one can observe the appearance of unpredictability of occupied quantum levels with the help of branching points located on both sides of a separatrix .",
    "let us suppose , that one of the system parameters , for example , the amplitude of variable field @xmath171 varies adiabatically ( @xmath193 , @xmath194-frequency of slow motion ) . in common problems of a quantum mechanics is believed that the distance between levels in an energy distribution , depending on exterior parameters vary synchronously with adiabatically varying parameter , not changing in this case a quantum state .",
    "the situation is changed radically , if in a quantum mechanical problem of the definition of energy distribution and eigenfunctions is reduced to the analysis of diagrams of the ince - strutt type . at slow moving along the curves of mathieu - characteristics due to the adiabatic change of the amplitude of variable field , after multiple passages through the branching points it is impossible to determine exactly in which mathieu - characteristic ( in which quantum state ) the system can be found .",
    "one can consider this appearance as quantum analog of formation of a stochastic layer of motion in the area of classical separatrix .",
    "let us pass to the analysis of overlapping criterion in a quantum case.taking into account the quantum virial theorem , connecting average kinetic energy @xmath21 with the average potential energy @xmath171",
    "@xmath195 for variation of action @xmath115 with the help of ( 44 ) we obtain : @xmath196 where @xmath197 and @xmath198 .",
    "the condition of overlapping of resonances takes the form :          as can be seen from ( 50 ) , conditions of resonances overlapping in the quantum case is determined by magnitude of @xmath202 .this condition is reduced to that how many levels of nonlinearity of energy @xmath120 can be located in @xmath171 .",
    "thus , at quantum reviewing , the additional factor @xmath203 appears in the overlaping criterion .",
    "the physical sense of @xmath203 can be clarified . if the classic criteria of the resonances overlapping @xmath204 , is fulfilled then , according to ( 50 )",
    ", the magnitude of @xmath203 determines the conditions of weakening @xmath205 or amplifying @xmath206 the resonances overlapping criterion , in the comparison with the classical one .",
    "differently @xmath207 means that the condition of overlapping of resonances more easily can be fulfilled in a quantum case .",
    "the data of numerical calculations for the magnitude @xmath203 are given on the fig 10 . as it is visible from fig .",
    "10 , @xmath207 , i.e. , the resonances overlapping criterion amplifies in the quantum case . for high values @xmath202 ( the quasi - classical case ) @xmath203 should tend to unit . on fig .",
    "11 the eigenvalues of an energy @xmath208 as a functions of @xmath209 are presented for states described by the functions @xmath210 and @xmath211 . from figs .",
    "10 and 11 it is easy to see that the maximum value of @xmath203 corresponds to @xmath212 .",
    "thus , in the quantum case the area , lying below classical separatrix , corresponds to the area of the maximum stochasticity ."
