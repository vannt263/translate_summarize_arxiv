    "during the past few years , phase - coherent quasi - particle transport in hybrid superconducting structures has emerged as a new field of study , bringing together the hitherto separate areas of superconductivity and mesoscopic physics [ altshuler , lee and webb 1991 , buot 1993 ] .",
    "the seeds of this new field of research were sown for a variety of different reasons .",
    "the search for novel devices led several groups to embark on experimental programmes aimed at exploring the properties of hybrid semiconducting - superconducting structures . during the 1980s",
    "there had been great progress in understanding transport properties of normal sub - micron conductors and therefore towards the end of that decade , it seemed natural to ask how these were affected by the presence of superconductivity .",
    "partly as a consequence of formidable technological problems to be overcome in growing hybrid nanostructures , the first experimental results did not emerge until the summer of 1991 , when two groups [ petrashov and antonov 1991 , kastalskii et al 1991 ] independently submitted papers on phase - coherent transport in sub - micron superconducting structures .",
    "the first of these reported an * increase * in resistance in metallic conductors due to the onset of superconductivity and the second the discovery of a zero - bias anomaly in the dc resistance of a superconductor - semiconductor ( s - sm ) contact .",
    "the former is still the subject of theoretical investigation [ wilhelm et al 1997 , seviour et al 1997 ] , while the latter is now well - understood .    in a phase - coherent normal - superconducting ( n - s ) structure ,",
    "the phase of quasi - particles as well as cooper pairs is preserved and transport properties depend in detail on the quasi - particle states produced by elastic scattering from inhomogeneities and boundaries .",
    "a key physical phenomenon , which arises in the presence of superconductivity is the possibility that an electron can coherently evolve into a hole and vice versa .",
    "this phenomenon , known as andreev scattering [ andreev 1964 ] , occurs without phase breaking and is describable by a variety of theoretical techniques .",
    "the effect of superconductivity on transport across a n - s interface is of course an old subject . in lowest order ,",
    "the classical tunneling hamiltonian approach ignores andreev scattering and predicts that the dc conductance @xmath0 is proportional to the density of states .",
    "later [ shelankov 1980 , blonder , tinkham and klapwijk ( btk ) 1982 , blonder and tinkham 1983 , shelankov 1984 ] it was pointed out that the contribution to the sub - gap conductance from andreev scattering can be significant and a theory of a clean n - i - s interface was developed , which showed that for a delta - function barrier , there is indeed a marked deviation from tunneling theory , but as the barrier strength is increased , the result of classical tunneling theory is recovered .",
    "btk theory applies to a one - dimensional n - i - s system or , by summing over all transverse wavevectors , to 2 or 3 dimensional systems with translational invariance in the plane of the barrier and yields for the current @xmath1 through the contact    @xmath2    where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are andreev and normal reflection coefficients listed in table ii of [ blonder et al 1982 ] , @xmath5 the fermi function and @xmath6 a measure of the area of the junction . in the presence of disorder or other inhomogeneities ,",
    "this must be replaced by the more general expressions outlined in sections ii and iv below .",
    "prior to 1991 , experiments on n - i - s point contacts have been in broad agreement with btk theory , exhibiting a conductance minimum at zero voltage @xmath7 and a peak at @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the superconducting energy gap . in the experiment of kastalskii et al . [",
    "1991 ] , the dc current through a nb - ingaas contact is measured as function of the applied voltage . at the interface , depending on the semiconductor doping level , a schottky barrier naturally forms so that the system behaves like a superconductor - insulator - normal ( s - i - n ) structure .",
    "( an exception to this is inas , which does not form a schottky barrier at an n - s interface . ) according to btk theory , as the barrier strength increases the sub - gap conductance should vanish .",
    "in contrast , the experiment revealed an excess sub - gap conductance at low bias , whose value was comparable with the conductance arising when the superconducting electrode is in the normal state .",
    "this zero bias anomaly ( zba ) was later observed by nguyen et al . [",
    "1992 ] in an experiment involving inas - alsb quantum wells attached to superconducting nb contacts and by using high transmittance nb - ag ( or al ) contacts of varying geometry , xiong et al . [",
    "1993 ] were able to observe the evolution from btk to zba behaviour . in an experiment by bakker et al .",
    "[ 1994 ] involving a silicon - based two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) contacted to two superconducting electrodes , a gate voltage was also used to control the strength of the zba and in [ magnee et al 1994 ] an extensive study of the zba in nb / si structures was performed . since these early experiments , a great deal of effort has been aimed at observing andreev scattering in ballistic 2degs , including [ van wees et al 1994 , dimoulas et al 1995 , marsh et al 1994 , takayanagi and akazaki 1995(a ) , takayanagi , toyoda and akazaki 1996(a ) ]    kastalskii et al [ 1991 ] attributed the excess conductance to a non - equilibrium proximity effect , in which superconductivity is induced in the normal electrode , giving rise to an excess pair current .",
    "initially this phenomenon was seen as separate from andreev reflection , but subsequent theoretical developments have shown that the distinction between the proximity effect and andreev reflection is artificial . as will become clear later , the zba arises from an interplay between andreev scattering and disorder - induced scattering in the normal electrode .",
    "andreev scattering is sensitive to the breaking of time reversal symmetry and as a consequence the conductance peak is destroyed by the introduction of a magnetic field .",
    "zero bias anomalies constitute the first of a small number of paradigms of phase - coherent transport in hybrid n - s structures .",
    "a second paradigm is the observation of re - entrant [ van wees et al 1994 , charlat et al 1996 ] and long - range [ courtois et al 1996 ] behaviour signalled by the appearance of finite - bias anomalies ( fbas ) in the conductance of high - quality n - s interfaces . at high temperatures @xmath10 and bias - voltages @xmath11 , where for a n - metal of length @xmath12 and diffusion coefficient @xmath13 , @xmath14 , both the zba and fba conductance peaks decay as @xmath15 and @xmath16 . for a clean interface there",
    "also exists a conductance maximum at @xmath17 , @xmath18 and therefore at low - temperature and voltage a re - entrance to the low - conductance state occurs .",
    "an interesting feature of this phenomenon is the long - range nature of the effect , which typically decays as a power - law in @xmath19 , where @xmath20 .",
    "this behaviour is in sharp contrast with the exponential decay of the josephson effect and has been observed in a number of experiments . in a t - shaped ag sample with al islands at different distances from the current - voltage probes [ petrashov et al 1993(b ) ] , a long - range proximity effect was observed , in which the influence of the island extended over length scales greater than the thermal coherence length @xmath21 .",
    "similar behaviour was also observed [ petrashov et al 1994 ] in ferromagetic - superconductor hybrids made from ni - sn and ni - pb . in an experiment involving a square cu loop in contact with 2 al electrodes",
    "courtois et al [ 1996 ] clearly identified both the short- and long - range contributions to phase - coherent transport . in this interferometer experiment , they observed a phase - periodic conductance decaying as a power - law in @xmath22 , in parallel with a josephson current which decays exponentially with @xmath23 .    the above re - entrance phenomenon is also observed in a third paradigm of phase - coherent transport , which arises when a normal metal is in contact with two superconductors , with order parameters phases @xmath24 and @xmath25 , whose difference @xmath26 can be varied by some external means .",
    "prior to the experimental realisation of these structures , the electrical conductance of such andreev interferometers was predicted to be an oscillatory function of @xmath27 .",
    "spivak and khmelnitskii [ 1982 ] and altshuler and spivak [ 1987 ] identified a high temperature @xmath28 , weak localisation contribution to the conductance of a disordered sample , whose amplitude of oscillation was less than or of order @xmath29 .",
    "for an individual sample , the period of oscillation was found to be @xmath30 , but for the ensemble average a period of @xmath31 was predicted .",
    "nakano and takayanagi [ 1991 ] and takagi [ 1992 ] examined a clean interferometer in one - dimension and again predicted a @xmath30-periodic conductance with an amplitude of oscillation less than or of order @xmath29 .",
    "lambert [ 1993 ] examined a disordered conductor in the low - temperature limit @xmath32 and identified a new contribution to the ensemble averaged conductance with a periodicity of @xmath30 .",
    "this @xmath30 periodicity is a consequence of particle - hole symmetry , which also guarantees that at zero temperature and voltage , the conductance should possess a zero phase extremum [ lambert 1994 ] .",
    "prior to experiments on such devices , the generic nature of this prediction was confirmed in numerical simulations [ hui and lambert 1993(a ) ] encompassing the ballistic , diffusive and almost localised regimes and in a tunnelling calculation of the ensemble averaged conductance by hekking and nazarov [ 1993 ] .",
    "the first experimental realisations of andreev interferometers came almost simultaneously from three separate groups . in march of 1994 , de vegvar et al [ 1994 ] showed results for a structure formed from two nb electrodes in contact with an al wire .",
    "they found a small oscillation @xmath33 with a sample specific phase in the @xmath30 periodic component , suggesting that the ensemble averaged conductance should have a periodicity of @xmath31 , in agreement with spivak and khmelnitskii [ 1982 ] .",
    "however in contrast with all subsequent experiments , no zero phase extremum was observed . in april /",
    "may of that year , pothier et al [ 1994 ] produced an interferometer involving two tunnel junctions , which showed a @xmath30-periodic conductance , with a zero phase maximum and a low - bias , low - temperature amplitude of oscillation of order @xmath34 , which decayed with increasing temperature . in may 1994 ,",
    "van wees et al [ 1994 ] , [ see also dimoulas et al 1995 ] produced the first quasi - ballistic inas 2deg interferometer , with high transparency n - s interfaces .",
    "this experiment showed the first re - entrant behaviour in which the amplitude of oscillation @xmath35 varied from @xmath36 at zero voltage , ( where a minus sign indicates a zero phase minimum and a + sign a zero - phase maximum ) passes through zero at a bias of order 0.1mv , reaches a maximum at a bias of order @xmath17 and then decays to zero at higher voltages .",
    "( for a detailed study see [ den hartog et al , 1996 ] ) . unlike the josephson current which decays exponentially with @xmath37 , these conductance oscillations decayed only as a power - law .    the first experiment showing an amplitude of oscillation greater than @xmath29",
    "was carried out by petrashov et al [ 1995 ] . here ,",
    "silver or antimony wires in the shape of a cross , make two separate contacts with superconducting al and the phase difference between the contacts is varied using either an external field applied to a superconducting loop or by passing a supercurrent throught the al .",
    "the amplitude was found to be @xmath38 for ag and @xmath39 for sb , and exhibited a periodicity of @xmath30 . in this experiment ,",
    "the phase difference @xmath27 was varied both by passing a magnetic flux through an external superconducitng loop and by passing a supercurrent through a straight section of the superconductor , thereby emphasising that precise the manner in which the order parameter phase is controlled is not important .",
    "these experiments were crucial in demonstrating that in metallic samples , the ensemble averaged conductance is the relevant quantity and therefore a quasi - classical description is relevant .",
    "it is perhaps worth mentioning that with hindsight , an earlier experiment reporting large - scale oscillations in a sample with two superconducting islands [ petrashov et al 1993(a ) ] can be regarded a precursor to these interferometer experiments .",
    "however the phase of the islands was not explicitly controlled , making an interpretation of the 1993 experiments more difficult .",
    "a fourth and more recent paradigm of phase - coherent transport is the appearance of negative multi - probe conductances in structures where andreev transmission of quasi - particles is a dominant process [ allsopp et al 1994 ] .",
    "the first experiments reporting this behaviour were carried out by hartog et al [ 1996 ] , using a diffusive inas 2deg . these probe individual coefficients in the current - voltage relations and demonstrate fundamental reciprocity relations arising from time - reversal and particle - hole symmetry .",
    "finally a fifth paradigm is the suppression of electrical conductance by superconductivity in metallic systems without tunnel barriers .",
    "experimentally this phenomenon has been observed in several structures , involving both non - magnetic ( ie silver ) and magnetic ( ie nickel ) n - components in contact a superconductor via clean interfaces . in the experiment of petrashov and antonov [ 1991 ]",
    "the conductance of a ag wire on which several pb islands are deposited , decreases by 3% when the islands become superconducting , this corresponding to a conductance decrease of @xmath40 .",
    "these experiments reveal two regimes : as the field decreases below @xmath41 , an initial resistance increase occurs .",
    "the resistance remains field insensistive until a lower field is reached ( corresponding to the order of a flux quantum through the sample ) , at which point a further conductance suppression occurs . in the experiment by petrashov",
    "et al [ 1993b ] involving a t - shaped ag sample with al islands at different distances from the current - voltage probes , a superconductivity induced change in the resistance by up to 30% was observed , but it was found that for different samples , the resistance could either increase or decrease . although superconductivity - induced conductance suppression in metallic samples was predicted a number of years ago [ hui and lambert , 1993(b ) ] these experiments at first sight appeared to conflict with quasi - classical theories , which universally predict that the normal - state , zero - temperature , zero - bias conductance @xmath42 is identical the conductance @xmath43 in the superconducting state .",
    "this effect is addressed in [ hui and lambert 1993b , claughton et al 1995 , wilhelm et al 1997 , seviour et al 1997 ] .",
    "the main aim of this review is to outline the quasi - classical and multiple scattering theories needed to describe the dc electrical conductance of phase - coherent hybrid n - s structures . for this reason we shall not discuss thermodynamic phenomena such as the josephson effect in any detail , despite the fact that ground - breaking experiments using clean [ takayanagi and akazaki , 1995(b , c , d ) ] superconducting quantum s-2deg - s point contacts show quantization of the critical current as predicted by furasaki et al [ 1991 ] and for shorter junctions by beenaker and van houten [ 1991 ] .",
    "there are several notable theoretical papers addressing andreev scattering in such structures , including [ van wees et al 1991 , bagwell 1992 , furasaki et al 1994 , gusenheimer and zaikin 1994 , zyuzin 1994 , hurd and wendin 1994 and 1995 , bratus et al 1995 , chang et al 1995 , koyama , takane and ebisawa 1995 and 1996 , levy yeyati et al 1996 , martin - rodero 1996 , wendin and shumeiko 1996 , reidel et al 1996 , volkov and takayanagi 1996(b ) ] . similarly to restrict the length of this review , recent theories of thermoelectric coefficients",
    "[ bagwell and alam 1992 , claughton and lambert 1996 ] and shot noise will not be discussed [ datta 1995 ] , nor will we discuss work on coulomb effects in superconducting islands [ eiles et al 1993 , lafarge et al 1993 , tuominen et al 1992 and 1993 , hergenrother et al 1994 , black et al 1996 , hekking et al 1993 ] .    while andreev interference effects are generic phenomena , their manifestation in a given experiment is sensitive to many parameters . for the purpose of writing this review ,",
    "it is therefore convenient to adopt a simple classification of experimental arrangements sketched in figure 1 .",
    "the generic structure shown in figure 1a represents our first class of n - s - n hybrids and has many realisations . for convenience , we distinguish these from a second class of n - s hybrids of the kind shown in figure 1b and 1c , in which the superconductor effectively forms part of an external reservoir and is not simply part of the scattering region .",
    "figure 1d indicates a third class of n - ss-n structures , involving two ( or more ) separate superconductors s and s@xmath44 , with respective order parameter phases @xmath27 , @xmath45 .",
    "as noted above , transport properties of such andreev interferometers are periodic functions of the phase difference @xmath46 .",
    "figure 1e shows a fourth class of s - n - s structures , in which two superconducting reservoirs are connected to a normal scattering region . in this case",
    ", the structure forms a josephson junction and in contrast with all other structures shown in figure 1 , in the linear response limit , the dc conductance measured between the superconducting reservoirs is identically zero . in this case , the relevant dc quantity is the current - phase relation and the associated critical current .",
    "clearly one could also measure the josephson current between the two superconductors in the n - ss-n structure of figure 1c and therefore the above classification is intended to label the measurement being made , rather than the device being measured .",
    "structures of the form 1e will not be discussed .    for the most part ,",
    "the theoretical descriptions discussed below have finessed problems of self - consistency , by computing measured quantities as a function of the superconducting order parameter pairing field @xmath47 induced by making contact with a piece of superconductor . as an example , figure 1a shows a normal mesoscopic scattering region in contact with a superconducting island which plays the role of an externally controllable source of @xmath48 , in much the same way that the coils of a magnet are an external source of magnetic field .",
    "the coils are not of primary interest and in many cases , neither is the superconductor .",
    "it is assumed that parameters characterizing the superconductor are given and the key question is how does superconductivity influence transport through the scattering region .",
    "of course once the influence of superconductivity is understood , transport properties can be used to probe the symmetry and spatial stucture of the order parameter , as suggested by cook et al . [",
    "1996 ] . furthermore ,",
    "in the presence of large currents which modify the order parameter , a complete self - consistent treatment is necessary , as described for example in [ bruder 1990 , hara et al 1993 , barash et al 1995 , canizres and sols 1995 , chang et al 1995 , gyorffy 1995 , martin and lambert 1995 and 1996 , riedel et al 1996 ] .",
    "in this section we review the multi - channel current - voltage relations for a disordered phase - coherent scatterer connected to normal reservoirs , obtained for two normal probes by [ lambert 1991 ] and extended to multi - probes by [ lambert hui and robinson , 1993 ] .",
    "the coefficients ( denoted @xmath49 and @xmath50 below ) are directly accessible experimentally and can be combined to yield a variety of transport coefficients , the simplest of which is the electrical conductance of a normal - superconducting interface . to avoid time - dependent order parameter phases varying at the josephson frequency , which would render a time - independent scattering approach invalid ,",
    "these are derived under the condition that all superconductors share a common condensate chemical potential @xmath51 .",
    "the derivation of the fundamental current - voltage relation presented in [ lambert 1991 ] follows closely the multi - channel scattering theory developed during the 1980s for non - superconducting mesoscopic structures [ bttiker 1986 , buot 1993 ] . in the normal state , this approach yields , for example , the multi - channel landauer formula [ landauer 1970 ] for the electrical conductance    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the transmission coefficient of the structure . historically the above formula was not accepted without a great deal of debate and as we shall see in the following section , contradicts the corresponding expression used by practitioners of quasi - classical theories , where the alternative expression    @xmath54    is employed , with ( in one - dimension ) @xmath55 the reflection coefficient .",
    "in fact the above two expressions refer to a two - probe and to a four - probe measurements , respectively , and the crucial lesson from the debate surrounding these equations is that transport coefficients such as the electrical conductance are secondary quantities .",
    "more fundamental are the current - voltage relations describing a given mesoscopic structure .    equations ( [ a1 ] ) and ( [ a2 ] ) are not valid in the presence of andreev scattering , because charge transport and quasi - particle diffusion are no longer equivalent . for example when a quasi - particle andreev reflects at an n - s interface , the energy and probability density of the excitation are reflected back into the normal conductor , whereas a charge of @xmath56 is injected into the superconductor . thus charge flows into the superconductor , even though the excitation does not and as a consequence , a current - voltage relation should be used , which takes into account this charge - energy separation . for a scattering region connected to @xmath12 normal reservoirs , labelled @xmath57 , it is convenient to write this in the form    @xmath58    where @xmath59 is the current flowing from reservoir @xmath60 and the coefficients @xmath49 will be discussed in detail below . in the linear - response limit",
    ", this reduces to    @xmath61    the above expressions describe reservoirs at voltages @xmath62 , connected to a scattering region containing one or more superconductors with a common condensate chemical @xmath51 and relates the current @xmath63 from reservoir @xmath60 to the voltage differences @xmath64 , where @xmath65 .",
    "the @xmath66 formula describes a wide variety of experimental measurements and underpins many subsequent theoretical descriptions of disordered n - s interfaces and inhomogeneous structures . for this reason , after discussing the relationship between the coefficients @xmath49 , @xmath50 and the scattering matrix , we shall examine the two - probe formula in some detail and illustrate its application to some generic experimental measurements .",
    "the @xmath66 analysis of [ lambert 1991 ] is based on the observation that in the absence of inelastic scattering , dc transport is determined by the quantum mechanical scattering matrix @xmath67 , which yields scattering properties at energy @xmath68 , of a phase - coherent structure described by a hamiltonian @xmath69 . if the structure is connected to external reservoirs by open scattering channels labelled by quantum numbers @xmath70 , then this has matrix elements of the form @xmath71 .",
    "the squared modulus of @xmath71 is the outgoing flux of quasi - particles along channel @xmath70 , arising from a unit incident flux along channel @xmath72 . adopting the notation of [ lambert , hui and robinson 1993 ] , we consider channels belonging to current - carrying leads , with quasi - particles labelled by a discrete quantum number @xmath73 ( @xmath74 for particles , @xmath75 for holes ) and therefore write @xmath76 , where @xmath77 labels all other quantum numbers associated with the leads . with this notation , the scattering matrix elements @xmath78",

    "hence superconductivity can induce voltage sign - reversals which are not present in the normal limit .",
    "this feature was first predicted within the context of negative four - probe conductances [ allsopp et al 1994 ] and has been confirmed in recent experiments by the groningen group [ hartog et al 1996 ] .",
    "the above formulae relate measurable quantities to scattering matrix elements and therefore to end this section we briefly introduce the bogoliubov - de gennes equation [ de gennes 1989 ] , which forms a basis for computing the scattering matrix @xmath83 .",
    "the bogoliubov - de gennes equation arises during the diagonalization of the mean - field bcs hamiltonian , which for a non - magnetic , spin - singlet superconductor takes the form @xmath161 where @xmath162 is a constant , @xmath163 and @xmath164 are field operators , destroying and creating electrons of spin @xmath165 at position @xmath166 and @xmath167 to each positive eigenvalue @xmath168 of @xmath69 , with eigenvector @xmath169 satisfying    @xmath170    there exists a corresponding negative eigenvalue @xmath171 with eigenvector @xmath172 .",
    "consequently @xmath173 is diagonalized by the transformation @xmath174 where to avoid overcounting , only one of @xmath175 or @xmath176 is included in the sum over @xmath70 .",
    "it should be noted that whereas the bogoliubov - de gennes equation ( [ a38 ] ) refers to a model in which the variable @xmath166 varies continuously , in a tight - binding model , often used in numerical simulations , the corresponding bogoliubov - de gennes equation is    @xmath177    where @xmath178 ( @xmath179 ) indicates the particle ( hole ) wavefunction on site @xmath60 and @xmath180 labels a neighbour of @xmath60 .",
    "as discussed in [ hui and lambert 1990 ] and [ lambert , hui and robinson 1993 ] , for a scattering region connected to two crystalline normal leads , the bogoliubov - de gennes equation may be solved by means of a transfer matrix method , which yields a transfer matrix @xmath181 satisfying    @xmath182    where @xmath183 @xmath184 ) refer to vectors of outgoing ( incoming ) plane - wave amplitudes on the left and @xmath185 , ( @xmath186 ) to corresponding amplitudes on the right , each plane - wave being divided by the square root of its longitudinal group velocity to ensure unitarity of @xmath83 . whereas @xmath181 connects plane wave amplitudes in the left lead to amplitudes in the right lead , the @xmath83-matrix connects incoming amplitudes to outgoing amplitudes and satisfies @xmath187 once @xmath181 is known , the s - matrix can be constructed .",
    "indeed if @xmath83 is written as    @xmath188    then @xmath181 has the form    @xmath189    from which the following inverse relation is obtained ,    @xmath190    an alternative method of evaluating coefficients in the above current - voltage relations is provided by the recursive green s function method , which uses gaussian elimination to compute the green s function on sites located at the surface of the interface between external normal leads and the scatterer . given the surface green s function , scattering coefficients can be obtained from generalised fisher - lee relations [ fisher and lee 1982 ] , derived by [ takane and ebisawa 1992(a ) ] and later rederived in [ lambert 1993 , lambert , hui and robinson 1993 ] .",
    "this recursive technique is identical to the decimation \" method employed by [ lambert and hui 1990 ] and is essentially an efficient implementation of gaussian elimination .",
    "a third method of evaluating the coefficient @xmath191 was derived by [ beenakker 1992 ] for the case where there is perfect andreev reflection at the boundary of a clean superconductor .",
    "the resulting formula expresses @xmath191 in terms of scattering properties of the normal state , as discussed in section v below and facilitates the application of random matrix theory to n - s structures [ beenakker 1997 ] .",
    "in the previous section , the multiple scattering approach to dc transport was reviewed and in the following section the method of quasi - classical green s function will be discussed . whereas the multiple scattering method is a stand - alone approach , the quasi - classical technique must be supplemented by boundary conditions describing quasi - particle scattering at the interface between different metals .",
    "these boundary conditions are provided by scattering theory and therefore provide a bridge between the two approaches . in the literature , quasi - classical boundary conditions have not been discussed using the language of modern scattering theory and as a consequence are restricted to planar surfaces with translational invariance in the transverse direction . in this section we offer a rederivation of zaitsev s boundary conditions [ zaitsev 1984 ] , which not only fills this gap , but also yields a more general condition applicable to non - planar interfaces .    as noted in section 2 ,",
    "the starting point for a multiple scattering description is the scattering matrix @xmath83 , with matrix elements @xmath192 connecting incoming to outgoing scattering channels , and satisfying equation ( [ 3.1 ] ) .",
    "clearly @xmath193 is a functional of all physical potentials entering the hamiltonian @xmath69 , as well as a function of e. since @xmath69 is hermitian , quasi - particle probability is conserved , which yields @xmath194 and @xmath195 furthermore time reversal symmetry yields @xmath196 and @xmath197 hence @xmath198 and @xmath199    it should be noted that the the unitary matrix @xmath83 in equation ( [ 3.1 ] ) and the matrix @xmath181 in equation ( [ 3.2 ] ) connects open channels to open channels only .",
    "if evanescent states which decay at large distances from the scatterer are included in the outgoing states on the left - hand - side of ( [ 3.1 ] ) and states which grow at large distances are included on the right , then the corresponding scattering matrix @xmath200 and transfer matrix @xmath201 will not satisfy equations ( [ 3.6 ] ) and ( [ 3.7 ] ) .",
    "the matrices @xmath83 and @xmath181 should then be constructed by eliminating closed channels from @xmath200 and @xmath201 .    using the above definitions , the boundary conditions derived by zaitsev are readily extended to the case of multiple scattering channels .",
    "the problem to be solved is that of connecting the green s function @xmath202 in a region @xmath93 to the green s function(s ) in all other regions connected to the scatterer .",
    "although the following analysis is easily generalized to many leads attached to a scattering region , for simplicity of notation we restrict the discussion to only two leads .    for the purpose of this section ,",

    ", we obtain the general boundary condition relating the green s functions on the left of the scatterer , to the green s functions on the right : @xmath230    equation ( [ 3.16 ] ) is a generalisation of zaitsev s boundary condition to the case of a non - planar barrier , which in general may contain impurities and break time - reversal symmetry .",
    "yields an identical result and therefore the boundary condition is independent of the choice of @xmath216 . ]",
    "since the sum on the right - hand - side of equation ( [ 3.13 ] ) includes evanescent channels , the general boundary condition involves the matrix @xmath201 .",

    "one expects that the low energy @xmath537 dependence should be universal , while the high energy behaviour may differ from the inverse square root law , depending on the quality of the interface and on the effective dimensionality of the mesoscopic wire .",

    "the first is a josephson current between the two superconducting electrodes and decays exponentially as @xmath23 in agreement with known theory of superconducting weak links [ likharev 1979 ] .",
    "the second was shown to be due to a phase - periodic conductance with amplitude decaying as the inverse of the temperature .",
    "a detailed theory of the effect has been provided by [ volkov , allsopp and lambert 1996 and volkov and takayanagi 1996(a ) ] using both quasi - classical and multiple scattering methods .",
    "the different behaviour of the two contributions to the current occurs because the josephson current has a thermodynamic origin and is obtained by integrating over a range of energies of the order of @xmath538 , while the second contribution giving rise to the reentrant behaviour is kinetic in nature . in the structure considered in the experiments ,",
    "a non - vanishing value of the pair wave function @xmath539 is induced in the normal region .",
    "away from the superconductor the pair wave function decays exponentially as    @xmath540    where @xmath541 .",
    "the contribution to the josephson critical current comes from an integral over the energy involving the product of anomalous green s function @xmath542 and @xmath543 .",

    ", mesoscopic fluctuations can dominate and the non - averaged conductance @xmath0 is of interest , which depends in detail on the geometry and impurity realisation of a particular sample .",

    "we briefly review the various theoretical approaches and comment on their applicability to the experiments .",
    "we start by using quasi - classical theory to compute the ensemble averaged conductance when the mesoscopic normal conductor is in the diffusive transport regime .",
    "as noted in previous sections , the influence of superconductivity on the transport properties of a mesoscopic conductor may change in a qualitative way , depending on the quality of the normal - superconductor interfaces .",
    "consider first the zero temperature conductance of an interferometer comprising a tunnel junction ( labelled as 1 ) connected by diffusive 1-d wires to a fork .",
    "each of the two arms of the fork is a diffusive wire , connected via tunnel junctions ( labelled as 2 ) to infinitely long superconductors .",
    "the conductance of the diffusive wires is assumed to be much greater than that of the tunnel junctions . in this structure",
    "the superconductors play the role of elctrode and the main voltage drop occurs at the tunnel barriers .",
    "the conductance can be analysed using the circuit theory outlined in section iv [ nazarov 1994 , zaitsev 1994 ] , which yields    @xmath552    where @xmath553 is the conductance of the tunnel junction ( 1 ) , @xmath554 is the conductance of the tunnel junction ( 2 ) and @xmath27 is the phase difference between the two superconductors . in the limit @xmath555 , this simplifies to    @xmath556    whereas if @xmath557 ,    @xmath558    one can see that for @xmath559 there is a zero - phase minimum , as there is for @xmath560 .",

    "furthermore , the ratio @xmath561 controls the amplitude of the conductance oscillations which are greater when @xmath562 .",
    "the results of quasi - classical theory can of course be compared with the results of numerical multiple scattering theory .",
    "if the parameters used in the numerical simulations are chosen in such a way to satisfy the assumptions underlying the quasi - classical treatment , then a detailed analysis shows that this is indeed the case [ claughton , raimondi and lambert 1996 ] , although certain features , such as the vanishing of the conductance at @xmath563 , appear to be an artifact of te one - dimensional nature of the analysis leading to equation ( 155 ) .",
    "it is perhaps worth emphasizing that the exact numerical techniques used in [ claughton , raimondi and lambert 1996 ] are not confined to the diffusive regime and an interesting result of these simulations is that when the resistance of a given structure is dominated by tunnel barriers , the diffusive nature of the wires is not relevant and similar results are obtained for both ballistic or diffusive wires .",
    "the geometry is clearly important , but when dissipation occurs along the wire , the almost one - dimensional approximation used in many quasi - classical calculations works well .    another structure illustrating the role of finite temperature and voltage",
    "is suggested by the experiment by petrashov et al . [",
    "1995 ] , who measured the conductance of a mesoscopic wire , which makes contact with superconductors at points between the normal electrodes . at zero temperature ,",
    "this structure is predicted to have only small amplitude of osicllation arising from mesoscopic flcutuations , in contrast with the large amplitude oscillations observed experimentally . in the experiment however , a finite voltage drop is distributed along the wire and the temperature is non - zero .",
    "consequently the phase periodic conductance is dominated by an effect similar to the reentrant behaviour discussed in the previous section .",
    "the analysis of this structure has been carried out in detail by [ nazarov and stoof 1996 , volkov , allsopp and lambert 1996 , stoof and nazarov 1996 ] , using both quasi - classical and numerical multiple scattering methods .",
    "having discussed diffusive interferometers , we now examine the clean limit , which was first described in one dimension by [ nakano and takayanagi 1991 and takagi 1992 ] .",
    "an analytic theory of the ballistic limit in higher dimensions has also been developed [ allsopp et al 1996 ] , based on a multiple scattering description of a clean n - s interface . in the absence of disorder , when there is no phase difference between the two superconductors , translational invariance in the direction parallel to the interface ( and transverse to the current flow ) allows one to reduce the two - dimensional system to the sum over many independent one - dimensional channels .",
    "when a phase difference between the superconductors is imposed , inter - channel coupling is introduced , but as shown below , this coupling typically involves only pairs of channels in such a way that an accurate description is obtained by summing over independent * pairs * of coupled channels .",
    "this considerably simplifies evaluation of the boundary conductance    @xmath564    where @xmath565 is the andreev reflection probability from channel @xmath93 to channel @xmath60 .",
    "indeed the andreev reflection coefficient is of the form @xmath566 where @xmath567 and @xmath568 is the remaining contribution from inter - channel scattering , @xmath569 .",
    "if channels only couple in pairs , both the off - diagonal scattering and the diagonal scattering will scale as the number of channels .",
    "consider now a normal barrier in the n - region of a n - s interface .",
    "particles ( holes ) impinging on the normal scatterer are described by a scattering matrix @xmath570 , @xmath571 , and those arriving at the n - s interface by a reflection matrix @xmath572 , where    @xmath573 the elements of @xmath83 and @xmath572 are themselves matrices describing scattering between open channels of the external leads .",
    "for an ideal interface , where andreev s approximation is valid , @xmath574 and @xmath575 can be neglected and as a consequence , @xmath576 and @xmath577 are unitary and one obtains a generalization of a formula due to beennakker [ 1992 ] @xmath578 with @xmath579 in contrast with the analysis of bennakker [ 1992 ] , where @xmath576 is proportional to the unit matrix , the interference effect of interest here is contained in the fact that @xmath576 induces off - diagonal scattering . substituting @xmath580 into equation ( [ 7.4 ] ) and taking advantage of particle - hole symmetry at @xmath154 , yields    @xmath581    where @xmath582 with @xmath583 the transmission matrix of the normal scattering region .",
    "this multiple scattering formula for the boundary conductance is valid in the presence of an arbitrary number of channels and in any dimension",
    ".    equation ( [ 7.5 ] ) is very general and makes no assumption about the nature of matrices @xmath577 and @xmath570 . in a two - channel model , @xmath577 is chosen to be an arbitrary two dimensional unitary matrix and since in the absence of disorder , @xmath584 and @xmath585 are diagonal and interchannel coupling arises from @xmath577 only . substituting these matrices into equation ( [ 7.5 ] ) , yields an expression for @xmath580 involving a single phase @xmath293 , whose value is a linear combination of phase shifts due to normal reflection at the barrier , andreev reflection at the n - s interface and the phase accumulated by an excitation travelling from the barrier to the interface . after averaging over the rapidly varying phase @xmath293 ,",
    "the diagonal and off - diagonal terms are determined and found to vary periodically with @xmath27 with period @xmath30 as predicted in one dimension by [ nakano and takayanagi 1991 ] a key new feature of equation ( [ 7.5 ] ) is that the in the absence of the normal barrier , unitarity ensures the the total andreev reflection obtained by summing these two contribution is independent of @xmath27 and therefore the amplitude of conductance oscillation vanishes .",
    "thus to obtain a maximum amplitude of oscillation , the tunnel barrier must be tuned to a non - zero value .",
    "an interesting mechanism capable of producing large conductance oscillations which scale with the number of channels has been proposed by [ kadigrobov et al 1995 ] , based on the simultaneous resonance of andreev levels corresponding to different channels . to illustrate this ,",
    "consider for example the clean s - n - s structure analyzed by [ bardeen and johnson 1972 and kulik 1970 ] . for a long - junction , the andreev levels have energies @xmath586 , \\label{bardeen}\\ ] ] where @xmath587 is the component of the fermi velocity perpendicular to the n - s interfaces and @xmath588 the phase difference between the superconductors . in general these energies",
    "do not coincide , but when @xmath589 all levels pass through the fermi energy @xmath154 , yielding large - scale oscillations in transport properties . in the calculation of [ kadigrobov et al 1995 ]",
    ", normal scattering arises from the beam splitters which form an integral part of the structure considered and therefore no addition tunnel barriers are needed to break the unitarity condition of [ allsopp et al 1996 ] .",
    "when a superconducting island is added to a normal host , one navely expects that the electrical conductance of the composite material will increase .",
    "in contrast detailed calculations based on the multiple scattering formula [ hui and lambert 1993(b ) , claughton et al 1995 ] predicted that the change @xmath35 in the two probe conductance of a mesoscopic sample , due to the onset of superconductivity can have arbitrary sign .",
    "indeed for a sample with a high enough conductance , a simple theorem [ hui and lambert 1993 ] states that @xmath35 is guaranteed to be negative and furthermore the magnitude of @xmath35 is predicted to scale with @xmath0 . this anomalous proximity effect \" occurs in the absence of tunnel barriers and at first sight appears to conflict with the quasi - classical description presented in section iv , which predicts that at zero temperature , the conductance of equation ( [ a22 ] ) , which takes the form @xmath590 is unchanged by the onset of superconductivity . in this section we briefly discuss the origin of this effect and how it can be reconciled with quasi - classical theory .    for convenience",
    "we separately discuss the clean , diffusive and almost anderson localised limits .",
    "the landauer formula ( 2 ) predicts that the conductance of a normal ballistic wire is @xmath591 , where @xmath483 is the number of open scattering channels at the fermi energy @xmath592 .",
    "consequently in the absence of spin - splitting , if @xmath592 is varied , @xmath0 exhibits a series of steps of height @xmath29 corresponding to the opening or closing of scattering channels . the effect of inducing a uniform superconducting order parameter of magnitude @xmath593 in such a wire is shown in figure 9 of [ claughton et al 1995a ] . in the vicinity of normal - state steps , the conductance is predicted to be extremely sensitive to the onset of superconductivity . with increasing @xmath593 ,",
    "the steps are destroyed and @xmath0 decreases .",
    "this behaviour is attributed to the breakdown of andreev s approximation , which is most pronounced for scattering channels whose wavevector @xmath594 normal to the n - s interface tends to zero .",
    "such channels occur precisely at a normal - state conductance step .    for a clean n - s - n structure ,",
    "provided the superconductor is much longer than the superconducting coherence length @xmath595 , there is negligible quasi - particle transmission through the s region and therefore the total resistance reduces to the sum of two boundary resistances .",
    "since the boundaries are identical , this yields for the total conductance defined in equation ( [ a25 ] ) , @xmath596 and since the system consists of decoupled channels , @xmath191 can be obtained by solving the bogoliubov - de gennes equation at a one dimensional n - s interface . by insisting that scattered wavefunctions and their first derivatives be continuous at the boundary ,",
    "one finds [ claughton et al 1995a ] @xmath597    where @xmath598^{1/2 } } } \\label{9.2}\\ ] ]    and @xmath599 is the longitudinal kinetic energy of a quasi - particle incident along channel @xmath70 .",
    "clearly those channels corresponding to low angle quasi - particles with @xmath600 , possess a small andreev reflection probability @xmath601 and since there is no transmission , the corresponding normal reflection probability @xmath602 approaches unity .",
    "finally one obtains for conductance change @xmath35 due to the switching on of a uniform order parameter in such a clean system ,    @xmath603= \\sum_{n=1}^n { { 1-[1+(\\delta_0/\\mu_n)^2]^{1/2}}\\over { 1+[1+(\\delta_0/\\mu_n)^2]^{1/2}}}. \\label{9.3}\\ ] ]    it is perhaps worth noting that although the suppression of andreev reflection for low - angle quasi - particles is quite general , the destruction or otherwise of conductance steps in a quantum point contact , depends on the geometry of the contact .",
    "if quasi - particles are adiabatically accelerated before encountering the n - s interface , then andreev reflection need not be suppressed and conductance steps can survive . the criterion for the survival of the @xmath70th step is clearly @xmath604      the results of the previous subsection reveal that @xmath35 is sensitive to fine scale structure in the normal state conductance @xmath42 . for clean systems",
    "this structure takes the form of well - known conductance steps . for strongly disordered systems",
    ", it is known that @xmath42 can exhibit sharp resonances and therefore the behaviour of @xmath0 with increasing @xmath593 is sensitive to such features .",
    "this behaviour is illustrated in figure 10 of [ claughton et al 1995 ] , which shows that negative changes in the conductance with increasing @xmath593 are associated with resonances in the normal - state transport .    in view of tunnelling theory",
    ", one might regard the suppression of conductance in an almost insulating n - s structure as unsurprising , in which case the increase in the conductance due to the onset of superconductivity would be regarded as anomalous .",
    "a detailed description of such resonant transport in n - s and n - s - n structures and in resonant interferometers is provided by [ claughton and lambert 1995b ] , which follows an earlier zero - voltage theory [ beenakker 1992 ] and a one - dimensional description of a delta - like potential well [ khlus et al 1994 ] .",
    "the above results show that the conductance of a clean or very dirty conductor can either increase of decrease when superconductivity is induced , depending on the microscopic impurity configuration and on the geometry .",
    "this qualitative behaviour has been observed in experiments by petrashov and antonov [ 1991 ] and petrashov et al [ 1993(b ) ] , which also exhibit the weak magnetic field behaviour shown in fig 12 of [ claughton et al 1995a ] .",
    "nevertheless a quantitative comparison between these calculations and experiments is not possible , because of the differing geometries and multiprobe measurements .",
    "a first attempt at a quantitative comparison has been made recently by wilhelm , zaikin and courtois [ 1997 ] who noted that although the one - dimensional approximation used in sec .",
    "v and vi to study transport properties of n - s structures successfully explains a range of experiments , the experiment by [ petrashov et al 1991 ] requires a multiprobe description .",
    "the key observation is that the kinetic properties of a two - dimensional metallic film , in contact with a superconductor , differ substantially from those of a quasi one - dimensional wire , because of an inhomogenous distribution of the currents in the sample .",
    "although a detailed explanation of the effect can be obtained by solving the equations for the quasi - classical green s function in a two - dimensional structure , it is possible to gain considerable insight by adopting an effective circuit model , which captures the main features . for example consider four wires arranged in a square .",
    "the top two corners of the square ( labelled a and b ) are the voltage probes , while the lower two corners ( labelled c and d ) are the current probes .",
    "let the left - most vertical wire between corners a and c be placed in contact with a superconductor and labelled 1 , the right - most vertical wire between corners b and d labelled 2 and the upper and lower wires labelled 3 and 4 respectively .",
    "then the four - probe conductance reads    @xmath605    where @xmath606 is the conductance of wire @xmath60 .",
    "the analysis of sections iv , v and vi shows that the conductance of a wire in contact with a superconductor is changed in several ways .",
    "1 ) the local conductivity is _ increased _ by the presence of a superconductor , but this increase decays over a distance from the superconductor of the order of the coherence length of the normal metal @xmath607 .",
    "2 ) the conductance has a non monotonic behaviour as function of the energy and temperature .",
    "to a first approximation one may consider that when @xmath608 , only the wire attached to the superconductor will be appreciably affected by the presence of the superconductor .",
    "in such a situation the conductances @xmath554 , @xmath609 and @xmath610 are the same as in the normal state , while @xmath553 is _ increased_. in this case , according to equation ( [ fourprobes ] ) , the four - probe conductance is _ decreased _ by superconductivity . on the other hand , at @xmath611 , all conductances increase and so does the four - probes conductance . as",
    "[ wilhelm et al 1997 ] have shown this leads to a much richer structure in the temperature and voltage dependence of a two - dimensional film , compared with that of a one - dimensional wire and to qualitative agreement with experiment .",
    "a key prediction of [ wilhelm et al 1997 ] is that at zero bias and zero temperature this effect should vanish and the conductance should be unchanged by the onset of superconductivity .",
    "in contrast [ seviour et al 1997 ] identify an additional large - scale effect due to weak localisation , which is not contained in standard quasi - classical theory and which will survive at zero - temperature and zero - bias .",
    "we conclude this review by indicating a few lines of future research .",
    "the results of the first experiments in hybrid structures have been successfully explained in terms of almost one - dimensional models .",
    "this has been possible because the physical phenomena responsible for the transport properties of a given structure mainly occurred at the n - s interface , so that the actual geometrical arrangement of current and voltage probes was not important .",
    "this is clearly the case in the presence of low transmitting interfaces , which tend to dominate the overall transport properties .",
    "the improvement of the quality of n - s interfaces betweens separate parts of the hybrid structure and the contact leads makes necessary to take into account the detailed geometrical arrangement of a given measurement setup [ allsopp , hui , lambert and robinson 1994 ] . under this respect ,",
    "the last twelve months have witnessed a considerable experimental effort at paying particular attention to the geometry of a given measurement .",
    "as we have seen in the previous section taking into account the actual disposition of the current and voltage probes has been crucial to describe the effect of the conductance suppression , even though the structure itself has a one - dimensional geometry [ wilheml , zaikin and courtois 1997 ] .",
    "the recent experiment by [ hartog et al 1996 ] has beautifully shown the emergence of new physical effects when the geometry of the experimental setup is considered carefully .    a second important semplifying assumption in examining the experiments in hybrid structures consisted in neglecting the effect of electron - electron coulomb interaction .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption in many metallic and semiconducting wires used in the experiments . in these cases ,",
    "a mean - field treatment of electron - electron interaction is sufficient and can be easily incorporated in the effective electronic parameters . in the last decade",
    "there has been however a continuous progress in downsizing fabrication of electronic systems , so that it is now possible to measure transport through almost zero - dimensional structures , or quantum dots . in these systems , the effect of coulomb interaction is no longer negligeable , and various new effects arise .",
    "besides quantum dots , quantum wires also have been a subject of noticeable attention .",
    "it is well known that in one - dimensional systems electron - electron interaction drastically modifies the low energy properties and lead to the concept of luttinger liquid .",
    "quantum wires are believed to be an experimental realization of the luttinger liquid state . as a consequence in the last few years",
    "a considerable theoretical literature has accumulated with the intent of studing phase coherent transport in interacting systems .",
    "it is almost a logical consequence to foresee in the forthcoming years the emergence of a new field of research aimed at combining the fields of mesoscopic superconductivity and strongly interacting systems .",
    "indees already quite a few papers have started to appear [ fisher 1994 , fazio , hekking and odintsov 1995 , maslov , stone , goldbart and loss 1996 , fazio and raimondi 1997 , takane and koyama 1997 ] and the time is mature for new exciting developments ."
