    "it showed that the entanglement entropy decreases as one lowers temperature , indicating the degrees of freedom are reduced at lower temperature , and that the entanglement entropy can tell us not only the occurrence of the phase transition , but also the order of the phase transition .",
    "it indicates that entanglement entropy is indeed a good probe to phase transition . in refs .",
    "@xcite we investigated the behavior of entanglement entropy in the holographic s - wave superconductor / insulator model , and found that the entanglement entropy as a function of chemical potential is not monotonic in the superconducting phase : at the beginning of the transition , the entropy first increases and arrives at its maximum at some chemical potential , and then decreases monotonically .",
    "in this paper we continue our study of the entanglement entropy in holographic superconductor phase transitions .",
    "we here focus on the holographic p - wave superconductor / insulator model , paying main attention on whether those properties of entanglement entropy found in the previous studies are universal or not , in particular , on the non - monotonic behavior of the entropy in the superconductor / insulator phase transition .",
    "this will be helpful to further understand the superconductor / insulator transition . furthermore , there are also other motivations .",
    "it is well known that there is no thermal phase transition in @xmath6-dimensional field theories due to the mermin - wagner theorem or coleman theorem , which states that in quantum field theory , continuous symmetries can not be spontaneously broken at finite temperature in systems with sufficiently short - range interactions in spatial dimensions @xmath7 , which at least tells us that the phase transition can be affected by the space - time dimension of the system",
    ". however , one indeed observes the superconducting phase transition in the gravity dual of @xmath8-dimensional ads black hole backgrounds  @xcite .",
    "this might be caused by the suppression of the large fluctuations in the large @xmath9 limit , which is supposed to be one of conditions for the validness of the ads / cft correspondence . in the framework of ads",
    "/ cft correspondence , we can study the strongly coupled systems simply through their dual weakly interacting gravity theories .",
    "so a natural question arises that how the order of the phase transition of the strongly coupled systems can be affected by the dimension of space - time .",

    "@xcite that in contrast to the @xmath8-dimensional holographic p - wave superconductor / conductor phase transition , the phase transition in the @xmath6-dimensional case is always second order , regardless of the strength of the back reaction .",
    "to further stress the issue and enrich our understanding of the holographic superconductor phase transitions , therefore it would be helpful to study the full back reacted holographic p - wave superconductor / insulator model .",
    "the p - wave superconducting phase is characterized by the condensation of the vector ",
    "hair \"  @xcite , while the normal insulator phase is described by a pure ads soliton solution .",
    "as one increases the chemical potential , the pure ads soliton background will become unstable to develop the vector  hair \" .",
    "the emergence of the  hair \" induces the symmetry breaking and gives a finite vacuum expectation value of the dual current operator in the field theory side , which plays the role of order parameter in the holographic phase transition .",
    "we will choose the condensate of the current operator along one spatial direction .",
    "thus , the @xmath10 symmetry as well as the spatial rotational symmetry are broken in the superconducting phase .",
    "the order of the transition from the insulator phase to superconducting phase can be either second order or first order , depending on the strength of the back reaction of matter field on the bulk geometry .",
    "for the holographic s - wave superconductor / insulator case , one can find a new first order phase transition inside the superconducting phase  @xcite .",
    "we will see that this does not happen in the p - wave model . in view of the anisotropy in the superconducting phase , we will consider two strip geometries with a finite width along directions parallel to the super current and orthogonal to the super current , respectively . the value of entanglement entropy calculated in former setup is larger than the one in the latter case for given parameters .",
    "in addition , no matter of the order of the transition , we find the behavior of the entanglement entropy as a function of chemical potential is monotonic .",
    "more precisely , the entanglement entropy always increases as the increase of chemical potential .",

    "not , in this paper we generalized our study to the p - wave case .",
    "depending on the strength of the back reaction , the transition between the insulator phase and superconducting phase can be either second order or first order .",
    "however , unlike the case in s - wave model , there is no additional first order transition inside the superconducting phase .    with the aim of providing more information on some universal properties of holographic superconductors which may shed toy - model - based insights on understanding the real high @xmath115 superconductors , we continued the study of the behavior of entanglement entropy in the holographic superconducting phase transition .",
    "we limited ourselves in this paper to investigate an einstein - yang - mills model , which is dual to the p - wave superconductor / insulator phase transition . in this model , the rotational symmetry acting on @xmath11 and @xmath12 is also broken in the superconducting phase . in order to account for such anisotropy , we calculated the entanglement entropy for two kinds of strip geometry with finite width @xmath75 along @xmath11 direction and @xmath12 direction , respectively . in both cases ,",
    "the  confinement / deconfinement \" phase transition always appears .",
    "no matter of the order of the phase transition , the entanglement entropy as a function of chemical potential monotonically increases , which is much different from the s - wave case .",
    "since the entanglement entropy is a non - local quantity in the field theory side and measures the area of a minimal surface extending into the bulk in the holographic description , we do not expect that the entanglement entropy for the two kinds of strip geometry will be qualitatively different .",
    "our calculations indeed confirmed this and the entanglement entropy has a difference only quantitatively .",
    "more precisely , the difference increases as the condensate increases .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to conclude that the entanglement entropy indeed describes the new degrees of freedom emerging in the superconducting phase .",
    "we also extracted the critical width which behaves non - monotonic with respect to chemical potential .",
    "this behavior is the same as the one in the s - wave case .",
    "in addition , we further provided the evidence that the entanglement entropy can indeed indicate the appearance and the order of phase transition : in the second order phase transition case , the entanglement entropy is continuous , but its slope has a jump at the critical chemical potential , while in the first order transition case , both the entanglement entropy and its slope have a jump at the critical chemical potential .",
    "the different behavior of entanglement entropy in the s - wave case and p - wave case makes the aim to understand the non - monotonic behavior difficult at the moment .",
    "nevertheless , after a second thought , the different behavior of entanglement entropy in both cases looks not so surprised , since the properties of holographic s - wave model and p - wave model are quite different . ref .",
    "@xcite studied @xmath8-dimensional s - wave superconductor / conductor / insulator phase transition . for the conductor / superconductor case ,",
    "the order of the phase transition is always second order .",
    "in contrast to the conductor / superconductor case , the insulator / superconductor phase transition is second order for small back reaction , for intermediate back reaction , there is an additional first order transition inside the superconducting phase and the transition finally becomes first order for sufficiently large back reaction .",
    "similar phenomena exist even when one introduces more complex interaction  @xcite .",
    "actually , we have also checked the same model in one dimension less , i.e. , in @xmath6-dimensional case and found the same result .",
    "let us now consider holographic p - wave models . the full back reacted p - wave superconductor / conductor transition in @xmath8 dimensions studied in  ref .",
    "@xcite shows that the order of the phase transition changes from second order to first order as one increases the strength of the back reaction , while for the @xmath6-dimensional case , the transition is always second order  @xcite . the @xmath8-dimensional p - wave superconductor / insulator model studied in this paper and ref .",
    "@xcite behaves very similar to the @xmath8 dimensional p - wave superconductor / conductor model .",
    "let us note that the order of the phase transition for the p - wave case depends on not only the dimension of space - time , but also the strength of the back reaction .",
    "this is quite different from the s - wave case .",
    "furthermore , let us notice that in ref .",
    "@xcite , the entanglement entropy for a @xmath6-dimensional chiral p - wave superconductor model is calculated by dividing the system as two parts separated by a hyperplane . in this model",
    ", there are four phases separated by three quantum critical points at chemical potential @xmath116 and @xmath117 , which are labeled by the chern number @xmath118 as @xmath119 @xmath120 , @xmath121 @xmath122 , and @xmath123 @xmath124 .",
    "the entanglement entropy as a function of chemical potential is presented in figure 4-(e ) of ref .",
    "one can see from the plot that the behavior of the entanglement entropy depends on not only the phase , but also the aspect ratio @xmath125 , the ratio of lattice number in @xmath12 direction over in @xmath11 direction .",
    "in particular , in some phases both the monotonic and non - monotonic behaviors appear depending on the value of @xmath35 . for a large @xmath35 ,",
    "the entanglement entropy is monotonic in a fixed phase while it becomes non - monotonic for a small @xmath35 .",
    "it indicates that the entanglement entropy can indeed reveal many properties of many - body systems .    in our setup , the holographic",
    "superconductor extends infinitely along @xmath11 and @xmath12 directions . in some sense",
    "this case corresponds to the large r situation discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "therefore consider the entanglement entropy as a measure of the degrees of freedom for a given system , the monotonic behavior of the entanglement entropy in the holographic p - wave superconductor / insulator arises naturally .",
    "the normal insulator phase can be thought of as having little degrees of freedom due to the mass gap , which is consistent with the vanishing charge density .",
    "as we increase the chemical potential , the superconducting phase appears .",
    "the growth of the condensate and the charge density indicates that the total degrees of freedom increase , which just accounts for the increase of the entanglement entropy .",
    "however , it is still obviously necessary to understand the different behavior of entanglement entropy in holographic s - wave and p - wave superconductor / insulator transitions . for this , one needs know the details of dual field theories for these two kinds of models . in principle",
    ", one can finish this task if one could embed these two models into string theory or m - theory .",
    "unfortunately , we have not yet had the microscopic theories for these two models .",
    "nevertheless , the phenomenological bottom - up approach we adopted here can provide some basic information of a particular class of strongly coupled field theory . in this sense",
    "it might also helpful to use the entanglement entropy as a probe to study the holographic d - wave models  @xcite .",

    "the general falloff near the boundary is given by   where we choose @xmath40 since one wants the condensate to arise spontaneously .",

    "however , the equations of motion   have four useful scaling symmetries @xmath129          taking advantage of such four scaling symmetries , we can firstly set @xmath133 for performing numerics . after solving the coupled differential equations , we should use the first three symmetries again to satisfy the asymptotic conditions .",
