    "let us first discuss common ideas for cosmological perturbations in terms of the @xmath0 formalism . assuming that @xmath1 is a constant during inflation , the formula for @xmath0 is given by @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the fluctuation related to the time passed after horizon crossing . according to the traditional inflationary scenario ,",
    "the curvature perturbation is generated at the horizon crossing . ] .",
    "another idea for the cosmological perturbation is `` at the end '' scenario@xcite . ] . in the `` at the end '' scenario ,",
    "the curvature perturbation is generated at the end , where the fluctuation of the goal - line is induced by the light field ( @xmath4 ) ; @xmath5 .",
    "of course , considering the fluctuation of the distance ( @xmath6 ) to obtain @xmath3 is very natural , as it obviously causes the fluctuation of the number of e - foldings @xmath0 .",
    "however , we know that the time elapsed after horizon crossing @xmath7 depends not only on the distance @xmath8 but also on the inflaton velocity @xmath9 . therefore , if the inflaton velocity depends on a light field , the fluctuation of the light field may lead to the fluctuation of the inflaton velocity ; @xmath10 , which eventually causes @xmath3 and @xmath0 .",
    "the effect would be obvious when ( 1 ) many massless degrees of freedom appear in the inflaton trajectory , or ( 2 ) the inflaton mass is slightly larger than the hubble parameter and there is no significant perturbation from @xmath11 .",
    "based on the above simple speculation , we will focus on modulated@xcite inflaton velocity , where spatial fluctuation of the time elapsed during inflation @xmath3 is caused by the fluctuation of the inflaton velocity .. ] moreover , if the fundamental parameters are determined by the moduli in the underlying ( string ) theory , it would be natural to think that the planck scale may also depend on moduli .",
    "what happens if the planck scale is determined by moduli fields that may have fluctuations during inflation ?",
    "we will see that the perturbation related to @xmath12 is explained in terms of @xmath13 .",
    "let us see more details of this `` modulated velocity scenario '' , considering simple examples .",
    "( 400,250)(0,0 )      for the first example , we consider standard kinetic terms and conventional interaction term in the potential , @xmath14 . in this case , the definition of the number of e - foldings for constant @xmath1 is @xmath15 if there is no bend in the trajectory@xcite , the perturbation related to the inflaton velocity is expanded as @xmath16 where we consider linear scalar perturbations of the metric , @xmath17dx^i dx^j$ ] . from the conventional energy and momentum constraints we can find @xmath18 which suggests that the factor @xmath19 appearing in the delta - n formula decays after horizon crossing",
    "therefore , the factor @xmath20 must be included in the calculation , even if the perturbation @xmath21 itself is supposed to be a constant .",
    "of course , @xmath20 in the integral does not lead to the exponential suppression after the integration .",
    "it is easy to see that there is no exponential suppression for large @xmath22(@xmath23 ) , @xmath24 where the actual suppression factor is not significant .",
    "in fact , the corrections from terms proportional to @xmath25 have been disregarded in previous studies , since @xmath25 is obviously small at a distance . however ,",
    "if they appear in the equation of @xmath26 , these terms may yield significant correction to @xmath27 after integration , as we can see easily from the above equation .",
    "next , we consider moduli - dependent kinetic term @xmath28 . in this case",
    ", the number of e - foldings is @xmath29 again , we assume no bend . @xmath0 that is caused by the moduli perturbation is @xmath30 note that unlike the perturbation caused by the potential , the constraints from the energy and momentum does not yield @xmath31 factor for the perturbation related to the kinetic term@xcite .",
    "let us see what happens if both boundaries are completely flat while there is modulated velocity . here",
    "we consider fast - roll inflation with hybrid - type potential@xcite .",
    "inflaton may have large mass ( @xmath32 ) due to the @xmath33-problem .",
    "then @xmath34 decays or can not cross the horizon during inflation . even in this case ,",
    "non - oscillationary ( fast - roll ) inflation is possible if the friction is significant .",
    "we consider the hybrid - type potential @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the inflaton and @xmath37 is the trigger field . here",
    "the end of inflation expansion occurs at @xmath38 and the number of e - foldings is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 . considering the factor @xmath41",
    ", we find for @xmath42 , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the derivative of @xmath45 with respect to @xmath4 .",
    "more specific result is obtained for @xmath46,\\ ] ] where @xmath0 is given by @xmath47 since the mass of @xmath4 is smaller than @xmath48 during inflation , we find the condition @xmath49 in this case , the non - gaussianity parameter is @xmath50 which can be large and may take either sign .",
    "our question is `` is it possible to add significant non - gaussianity to the standard inflationary perturbation after horizon crossing ? ''",
    "our answer is `` yes '' . to show how to add non - gaussianity to the conventional perturbation",
    ", we consider hybrid inflation with standard @xmath51 interaction . during inflation",
    ", hybrid inflation has the effective potential @xmath52 where @xmath53 become massless near the enhanced symmetric point(esp ) at @xmath54 .",
    "the perturbation of the inflaton velocity caused by the number of n massless excitation is @xmath55 where the first order perturbation vanishes .",
    "the second order perturbation at the esp adds significant non - gaussianity to the perturbation ; @xmath56 since the non - gaussianity is uncorrelated , the usual non - linear parameter @xmath57 is given by @xmath58@xcite .",
    "we conclude that we can add significant non - gaussianity to the standard perturbation after horizon crossing .",
    "( 400,250)(0,0 )",
    "finally , we briefly mention the consequence of modulated planck scale in terms of the delta - n formalism . we consider a light scalar field @xmath59 coupled to gravity .",
    "the model is given by the action @xmath60.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] considering ( for simplicity ) jordan - brans - dicke theory , the action in the einstein frame has the moduli - dependent kinetic term @xmath61 , where @xmath62 and the potential @xmath63 note that there are both sources for the velocity perturbation , from the potential and the kinetic term .",
    "the perturbation caused by the potential has the factor @xmath25 , while the one from the kinetic term does not .",
    "we considered cosmological perturbations caused by modulated inflaton velocity .",
    "the velocity perturbation has been disregarded in previous studies for multi - field inflation .",
