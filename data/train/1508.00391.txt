    "of which only @xmath5u has a long life time and the only thermally fissile isotope available in nature @xcite .",

    "@xcite showed that uranium and thorium isotopes with neutron number n=154 - 172 have thermally fissile property .",
    "they performed a calculation with a typical example of @xmath7u that this nucleus has a low fission barrier with a significantly large barrier width , which makes it stable against the spontaneous fission .",
    "apart from the thermally fissile nature , these nuclei also play an important role in the nucleosynthesis in the stellar evolution .",
    "as these nuclei are stable against spontaneous fission , thus the prominent decay modes may be the emission of @xmath0- , @xmath1- and @xmath8-particles from the neutron - rich thermally fissile ( uranium and thorium ) isotopes .    to measure the stability of these neutron - rich u and th isotopes",
    ", we investigated the @xmath0- and @xmath1- decay properties of these nuclei .",
    "also , we extend our calculations to estimate the binding energy , root mean square radii , quadrupole moments and other structural properties .    from last three decades , the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) formalism is a formidable theory in describing the finite nuclear properties throughout the periodic chart and infinite nuclear matter properties concerned with the cosmic dense object like neutron star . in the same line rmf theory is also good enough to study the clusterization @xcite , @xmath0-decay @xcite , and @xmath1-decay of nuclei .",
    "the presence of cluster in heavy nuclei like , @xmath9ra , @xmath10u , @xmath6pu and @xmath11 cm has been studied using rmf formalism @xcite .",

    "the priority of the pairing correlation escalates with mass number a. it also plays a crucial role for the understanding of deformation of heavy nuclei . because of the limited pair near the fermi surface , it has a nominal effect for light mass nuclei on both bulk and single - particle properties . in the present case",
    ", we consider only t=1 channel of pairing correlation , i.e. , pairing between proton - proton and neutron - neutron . in such case , a nucleon of quantum state @xmath40 pairs with another nucleon having same @xmath41 value with quantum state @xmath42 , which is the time reversal partner of other .",
    "the philosophy of bcs pairing is same both in nuclear and atomic domain .",
    "the first evidence of the pairing energy came from the even - odd mass staggering of isotopes . in mean field formalism the violation of particle number is account of pairing correlation .",

    "the chemical potentials @xmath60 and @xmath61 are determined by the particle numbers for neutrons and protons .",
    "the pairing energy of the nucleons using equation ( 7 ) and ( 8) can be written as : @xmath62    in constant pairing gap calculation , for a particular value of pairing gap @xmath54 and force constant @xmath63 , the pairing energy @xmath64 diverges , if it is extended to an infinite configuration space .",
    "in fact , in all realistic calculations with finite range forces , the contribution of states of large momenta above the fermi surface ( for a particular nucleus ) to @xmath54 decreases with energy .",
    "therefore , the pairing window in all the equations are extended upto the level @xmath65 as a function of the single particle energy .",
    "the factor 2 has been determined so as to reproduce the pairing correlation energy for neutrons in @xmath66sn using gogny force @xcite .",
    "we notice that recently karatzikos et al .",
    "@xcite has been shown that if it is adjusted a constant pairing window for a particular deformation then it may leads to errors at different energy solution ( different state solution ) .",
    "however , this kind of approach have not taken into account in our calculations , as we have adjusted to reproduce the pairing as a whole for @xmath67 nucleus .",
    "it is a tough task to compute the binding energy and quadrupole moment of odd - n or odd - z or both n and z numbers are odd ( odd - even , even - odd , or odd - odd ) nuclei . to do this",
    ", one needs to include the additional time - odd term , as is done in the shf hamiltonian  @xcite , or empirically the pairing force in order to take care the effect of odd - neutron or odd - proton  @xcite . in an odd - even or odd - odd nucleus",
    ", the time reversal symmetry gets violated in the mean field models . in our rmf calculations , we neglect the space components of the vector fields , which are odd under time reversal and parity .",
    "these are important in the determination of magnetic moments  @xcite but have a very small effects on bulk properties such as binding energies or quadrupole deformations , and they can be neglected@xcite in the present context . here , for the odd - z or odd - n calculations , we employ the pauli blocking approximation , which restores the time - reversal symmetry . in this approach , one pair of conjugate states , @xmath68 , is taken out of the pairing scheme .",
    "the odd particle stays in one of these states , and its corresponding conjugate state remains empty . in principle , one has to block in turn different states around the fermi level to find the one that gives the lowest energy configuration of the odd nucleus . for odd - odd nuclei , one needs to block both the odd neutron and odd proton .",
    "in this section , we evaluate our results for binding energy , rms radii , quadrupole deformation parameter for recently predicted thermally fissile isotopes of th and u. these nuclei are quite heavy and needed a large number of oscillator basis , which takes considerable time for computation .",
    "we spent few lines in the first subsection of this section to describe how to select basis space and the results and discussions are followed subsequently .      the dirac equation for fermions ( proton and neutron ) and the equation of motion for bosons ( @xmath27 , @xmath69 , @xmath21 and @xmath70 ) obtained from the rmf lagrangian are solved self - consistently using an iterative methods .",
    "these equations are solved in an axially deformed harmonic oscillator expansion basis @xmath71 and @xmath72 for fermionic and bosonic wavefunction , respectively .    for heavy nuclei ,",
    "a large number of basis space @xmath71 and @xmath72 are needed to get a converged solution . to reduce the computational time without compromising the convergence of the solution",
    ", we have to choose an optimal number of model space for both fermion and boson fields . to choose optimal values for @xmath71 and @xmath72 , we select @xmath73th as a test case and increase the basis quanta from 8 to 20 step by step",
    ". the obtained results of binding energy , charge radii and quadrupole deformation parameter are shown in fig .",
    "[ bea1 ] . from our calculations",
    ", we notice an increment of 200 mev in binding energy while going from @xmath748 to 10 .",
    "this increment in energy decreases while going to higher oscillator basis .",
    "for example , change in energy is @xmath75 mev with a change of @xmath76 from 14 to 20 and the increment in @xmath77 values are 0.12 fm respectively . keeping in mind the increase in convergence time for larger quanta as well as the size of the nuclei considered , we have finalized to use @xmath78 in our calculations to get a suitable convergent results , which is the current accuracy of the present rmf models .    ) and quadrupole deformation parameter ( @xmath79 ) are given with bosonic and fermionic basis . ]      to be sure about the predictivity of our model , first of all we calculate the binding energies ( be ) , charge radii @xmath77 and quadrupole deformation parameter @xmath39 for some of the known cases .",
    "we have compared our results with the experimental data wherever available or with the finite range droplet model ( frdm ) of mller et al . @xcite .",
    "the results are displayed in tables  [ tab1 ] and  [ tab2 ] . from the tables",
    ", it is obvious that the calculated binding energies are comparable with the frdm as well as experimental values .",
    "a further inspection of the tables reveal that the frdm results are more closer to the data .",
    "this may be due to the fitting of the frdm parameters for almost all known data .",
    "however , in case of most rmf parametrizations , the constants are determined by using few spherical nuclei data along with certain nuclear matter properties .",
    "thus the prediction of the rmf results are considered to be reasonable , but not excellent .",
    "ren et al .",
    "@xcite have reported that the ground state of several superheavy nuclei are highly deformed states .",
    "since , these are very heavy isotopes , the general assumption is that the ground state most probably remains in deformed configuration ( liquid drop picture ) .",
    "when these nuclei excited either by a thermal neutron or by any other means , it s intrinsic excited state becomes extra - ordinarily deformed and attains the scission point before it goes to fission .",
    "this can also be easily realized from the potential energy surface ( pes ) curve .",
    "our calculations agree with the prediction of ren et al . for other superheavy region of the mass table .",
    "however , this conclusion is contradicted by  @xcite . according to him , the ground state of superheavy nuclei either spherical or normally deformed .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab3 ]    usually , in an axially deformed constraint calculation for a nucleus , we see two maxima in the pes diagram , ( i ) prolate and ( ii ) oblate or spherical . however , in some cases , more than two maxima are also seen .",
    "if the ground state energy is distinctly more than other maxima , then the nucleus has a well defined ground state configuration . on the other hand ,",
    "if the difference in binding energy between two or three maxima is negligible , then the nucleus is in shape co - existence configuration .",
    "in such a case , a configuration mixing calculation is needed to determine the ground state solution of the nucleus , which is beyond the scope of the present calculation .",
    "it is to be noted here that in a constraint calculation , the maximum binding energy ( major peak in the pes diagram ) corresponds to the ground state configuration and all other solutions ( minor peaks in the pes curve ) are the intrinsic excited states .",
    "the fission barrier @xmath80 is an important quantity to study the properties of fission reaction .",
    "we calculate the fission barrier from the pes curve for some selected even - even nuclei , which are displayed in table  [ tab3 ] . from the table",
    ", it can be seen that the fission barrier for @xmath81th comes out to be 5.69 mev comparable to the frdm and experimental values of @xmath80 = 7.43 and 6.50 mev , respectively .",
    "similarly , the calculated @xmath80 of @xmath10u is 5.65 mev , which also agree well with the experimental data 5.40 mev . in some cases ,",
    "the fission barrier height is 1@xmath822 mev lower or higher than the experimental data .",
    "the double - humped fission barrier in all these cases are reproduced .",
    "similar type of calculations are also done in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in nuclei like @xmath2th and @xmath3u",
    ", we find three maxima . among these maxima , two of them",
    "are found at normal deformation ( spherical and normal prolate ) , but the third one is situated far away , i.e. , at relatively large quadrupole deformation . with a careful inspection , one can also see that one of them ( mostly the peak nearer to the spherical region ) is not strongly pronounced and can be ignored in certain cases . this third maximum separate the second barrier with a depth of 1 - 2 mev , responsible for the formation of resonance state , which are observed experimentally@xcite .",
    "some of the uranium isotopes @xmath83u , the ground states are predicted to be spherical in rmf formalism agreeing with the frdm results .",
    "the other isotopes of the series @xmath84u are found to be prolate ground state matching with the experimental data .",
    "similarly , the thorium nuclei @xmath85th are spherical in shape and @xmath86th are prolate ground configuration .",
    "in addition to these shapes , we also notice sallow regions in the pes curves of both th and u isotopes .",
    "these fluctuation in the pes curves could be due to the limitation of mean field approximation and one needs a theory beyond mean field to over come such fluctuations .",
    "for example , the generator coordinate method or random phase approximation could be some improved formalism to take care of such effects  @xcite . beyond the second hump , we find the pes curve goes down and down , which never ups again .",
    "this is the process of the liquid drop gets more and more elongation and reaches to the fission stage .",
    "the pes curve , from which it starts downing is marked the scission points which are shown by the black dot in some of the pes curves of figs .",
    "[ bea2 ] and  [ bea3 ] .      in this subsection",
    ", we evaluate the neutron and proton single - particle energy levels for some selected nilssion orbits with different values of deformation parameter @xmath79 using the constraint calculations .",
    "the results are given in figs .",

    "this effect is clear for heavy elements approaching n=126 with the gap between 3p@xmath88 and 1i@xmath89 of about 2 - 3 mev , in the neutron single - particle of @xmath87u and @xmath10th . in both the figures ,",
    "the neutron single particle energy level 1i@xmath90 lies between 2f@xmath91 and 2f@xmath92 creating a distinct shell gap at n=114 . in @xmath10th and @xmath87u , with increasing deformation the opposite parity levels of 2g@xmath93 and 1j@xmath94 come closer to each other , which are far apart in the spherical solution .",
    "this gives rise to the parity doublet phenomena @xcite .",
    "in this section , we will discuss about various mode of decays encounter by superheavy nuclei both in the @xmath1-stability line as well as away from it .",
    "this is important , because the utility of superheavy and mostly the nuclei which are away from stability lines depend very much on their life time .",
    "for example , we do not get @xmath4u and @xmath6pu in nature , because of their short life time , although these two nuclei are extremely useful for energy production .",
    "that is why @xmath5u is the most necessary isotope in the uranium series for its thermally fissile nature in the energy production in fission process both for civilian as well as military use .",
    "the common mode of instability for such heavy nuclei are spontaneous fission , @xmath0- , @xmath1- and @xmath8-decays .",
    "all these decays depend on the neutron to proton ratio as well as the number of nucleons present in the nucleus .      in the previous papers@xcite",
    ", we have analyzed the densities of nuclei in a more detailed manner . from this analysis",
    ", we concluded that there is no visible cluster either in the ground or in the excited intrinsic states .",
    "the possible clusterizations are the @xmath0-like matter at the interior and neutron - rich matter at the exterior region of the normal and neutron - rich superheavy nuclei , respectively .",
    "thus , the possible mode of decays are the @xmath0-decay for @xmath1-stable nuclei and @xmath95-decay for neutron - rich isotopes .",
    "to estimate the stability of such nuclei , we have to calculate the @xmath0-decay @xmath96 and the @xmath1-decay @xmath97 half - lives times .",
    "to calculate the @xmath0-decay half - life @xmath100 , one has to know the @xmath13 energies of the nucleus .",

    "so , in case of the short life time of @xmath126th and @xmath127u , one can choose a lighter isotope of the series for practical utility .      before drawing the concluding remarks , it is important to mention few points about the limitations of our present approach .",
    "when we compare our calculated results with the experimental data , although we get satisfactory results , some time we do not get excellent agreement and the main possible reasons for the discrepancy of rmf with experimental values are given as : + ( 1 ) in rmf formalism we are working in the mean field approximation of the meson field . in this approximation , we are neglecting the vacuum fluctuation , which is an indispensable part of the relativistic formalism . in calculating the nucleonic dynamics",
    ", we are neglecting the negative energy solution that means , we are working in the no sea approximation  @xcite .",
    "it is already discussed that the no - sea approximation and quantum fluctuation can improve the results upto a maximum of 20%  @xcite for very light - nuclei .",
    "therefore , the mean field is not a good approach for the light region of the periodic table .",
    "however , for the heavy masses , this mean field approach is quite good and can be used for any practical purpose . + ( 2 ) in order to solve the nuclear many body system , here we used the hartee formalism and neglect fock term , which corresponds to the exchange correlation .",
    "+ ( 3 ) to take care of the pairing correlation , we have used bcs type pairing approach .",
    "this gives good results for the nuclei near the @xmath1-stability line , but it fails to incorporate properly the pairing correlation for the nuclei away from the @xmath1-stability line and superheavy nuclei  @xcite . thus a better approach like hartree - fock - bogoliubov  @xcite type pairing co - relation is more suitable for the present region .",
    "+ ( 4 ) parametrization plays an important role in improvising the results .",
    "the constants in rmf parametrizations , are determined by fixing the experimental data for few spherical nuclei .",
    "we expect that the results may be improved by re - fitting the force parameters for more number of nuclei , including the deformed isotopes .",
    "+ ( 5 ) the basic assumption in the rmf theory is that two nucleons interact with each other through the exchange of various mesons .",
    "there is no direct inclusion of 3-body or higher body effects .",
    "this effect is taken care partially by including the self - coupling of mesons and in recent relativistic approach various cross - couplings are added because of their importance .",
    "+ ( 6 ) although , there are various mesons are observed experimentally , few of them are taken into account in the nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "contribution of some of them are prohibited due to symmetry reason and many are neglected due to their negligible contributions , because of heavy mass .",
    "however , some of them has substantial contribution to the properties of nuclei , specially when the neutron - proton asymmetry is more , such as @xmath128-meson  @xcite .",
    "+ ( 7 ) it is to be noted that the origin of @xmath0-decay or @xmath8-decay phenomena are purely quantum mechanical process .",
    "thus the quantum tunneling plays an important role in such decay processes .",
    "the deviation of experimental @xmath0-decay life time from the calculated results obtained by the empirical formula may not be suitable for such heavy nuclei , which are away from the stability line and more involved quantum mechanical treatment is needed for such cases .",
    "in summary , we did a thorough structural study of the recently predicted thermally fissile isotopes of th and u series in the framework of relativistic mean field theory .",
    "although there are certain limitations of the present approach , the qualitative results will remain unchanged even if the draw - back of the model taken into account .",
    "the heavier isotopes of these two nuclei bear various shapes including very large prolate deformation at high excited configurations .",
    "the change in single - particle orbits along the line of quadrupole deformation are analyzed and found parity doublet states in some cases . using an empirical estimation , we find that the neutron - rich isotopes of these thermally fissile nuclei are predicted to be stable against @xmath0- and @xmath8-decays .",
    "the spontaneous fission also does not occur , because the presence of large number of neutrons makes the fission barrier broader . however , these nuclei are highly @xmath1-unstable .",
    "our calculation predicts that the @xmath1-life time is about tens of seconds for @xmath126th and @xmath127u and this time increases for nuclei with less neutron number , but thermally fissile .",
    "this finite life time of these thermally fissile isotopes could be very useful for energy production in nuclear reactor technology .",
    "if these neutron - rich nuclei use as nuclear fuel , the reactor will achieve critical condition much faster than the normal nuclear fuel , because of the release of large number of neutrons during the fission process .",
