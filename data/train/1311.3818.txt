    "the deformation properties of bulk metallic glasses are characterised by two temperature regimes  @xcite . at high temperatures , close to the glass transition temperature ,",
    "bmgs deform homogeneously with the strain rate properties being reasonably well understood by thermally activated plastic flow . at lower temperatures ,",
    "plasticity becomes heterogeneous and highly localized to shear - bands , resulting in limited ductility in tension and a few percent plastic strain prior to failure for some bmgs in compression . in this regime of temperatures both athermal  @xcite and thermal  @xcite theories of plasticity have been proposed .",
    "in the early work of turnbull and cohen  @xcite these different regimes emerged as a result of two competing processes , one diffusional and one stress induced .",
    "later , spaepen @xcite attributed the homogeneous regime as resulting from a steady state of free volume creation and diffusional related free volume annihilation .",
    "heterogeneous flow on the other hand was dominated by free volume creation since annihilation became diffusion limited at low temperatures . that two distinct temperature scales exist",
    "was also recognised by argon  @xcite , who from the perspective of thermal activation developed two microscopic theories where at high temperature , plasticity was mediated by small atomic reconfigurations that resulted in a localized shear strain event , and at lower temperature , a less local structural excitation that was akin to the nucleation of a dislocation loop occurs .",
    "such mechanisms could give insight into the observed high temperature homogeneous plasticity and the low temperature heterogeneous plasticity .",
    "some time after this , high - strain rate atomistic simulation revealed the generality of such local structural excitations , where the transition from homogeneous to heterogeneous plasticity ( as a function of decreasing temperature or increasing strain rate ) emerged from the degree of correlation between such localized activity  @xcite . due to their high strain rates and stresses , both dynamic and static atomistic simulations",
    "primarily probe the athermal region of plasticity . out of the earliest of this work by falk and",
    "langer  @xcite arose the concept of the shear transformation zone ( stz ) which was assumed to exist in regions of the material not so well relaxed  the so - called liquid like regions @xcite .",
    "the corresponding structural transformations were assumed to be activated _ athermally _ once a critical stress had been reached .",
    "such ideas developed into what is now called the effective temperature theories in which the quenched disorder well below the glass transition temperature is characterised by an effective temperature that describes the structural fluctuations within the material , see for example  @xcite .",
    "this approach has been quite successful in developing a quantitative understanding of experimental low temperature deformation data .",
    "it was recognised by bouchbinder , langer and falk  @xcite that if one were to assume a thermal activation picture within the stz framework  @xcite , the density of such local structural excitations would have to be `` improbably '' large if the corresponding activation energies are in the realistic range of hundreds of kilojoule per mole ( or electron volts per excitation ) . in going to an athermal picture ,",
    "this difficulty was avoided and indeed stzs could now occur at quite dilute densities  @xcite , a picture that is compatible with the distinct liquid like regions assumed to exist within the glass .",
    "understanding the nature of such stzs , or more generally localized structural excitations , has also been influenced by the physics of the under - cooled liquid regime , in which two distinct relaxation time - scales are evidenced : that of the slow @xmath0-relaxation and the fast @xmath1-relaxation processes first introduced by goldstein  @xcite . at temperatures near the glass transition and below",
    ", the @xmath0-relaxation processes rapidly increase their time - scale with the traditional viewpoint being that they freeze out of the structural dynamics in the amorphous solid regime  @xcite . despite such an assumed freezing ,",
    "the terminology of @xmath0- and @xmath1-relaxation has also been applied to the amorphous solid regime where the microscopic @xmath1 processes mediate escape from the mega - basins of the elastic energy landscape of the @xmath0 processes  @xcite .",
    "the present work also exploits this terminology and uses an additional fundamental feature of the under - cooled liquid regime , that the number of structural transformations available will scale exponentially with respect to a fundamental volume measure  @xcite .",
    "such ideas have been used in the early thermodynamic theories of adam and gibbs  @xcite and kirkpatrick _ et al _ @xcite  see also the review article by heuer  @xcite  and provides a sufficient number of structural transformations to justify a thermal activation picture for temperatures that are well below the glass transition .",
    "in particular the present work develops further the ideas of refs .",
    "@xcite . in these works ,",
    "a thermal activation picture was developed in which the characteristic plastic rate with respect to an internal heterogeneous volume scale was determined from a distribution of @xmath0-relaxation barriers whose number scales exponentially with the size of the heterogeneous volume and whose statistics is described by a distribution with extensive first and second cumulants . by doing this , the average time scale associated with plasticity at a particular temperature becomes intimately connected to the @xmath0-relaxation potential energy landscape ( mediated by @xmath1 relaxation processes ) which is thermally accessible at that temperature . at zero loading or",
    "any given shear stress , two critical temperature scales emerge : 1 ) the plastic transition temperature which indicates a significant drop in the amount of plastic activity as the temperature is reduced , and 2 ) the ( lower ) kinetic freezing temperature where ( on average ) a single structural transformation becomes available per heterogeneous volume .",
    "the transition between the higher temperature regime of 1 ) and the lower temperature region of 2 ) corresponds to a change of statistics , from that of the most probable to that of the extreme .",
    "importantly , before the critical freezing temperature is reached , there will exist a low temperature regime ( below the glass transition ) where a sufficient number of thermally activated events exist to mediate a non - negligible macroscopic plasticity .",
    "thus , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the low temperature heterogeneous and high temperature homogeneous deformation regimes are distinguished by a transition in the nature of the statistics of the @xmath0-relaxation energy landscape . put in other words ,",
    "the freezing out of @xmath0-relaxation processes is only complete at temperatures far below that of the glass transition temperature , and until this extreme regime is reached thermal activation remains the underlying phenomenon controlling macroscopic plasticity  a fact that has been established experimentally for a variety of deformation geometries  @xcite including most recently that of shear band nucleation , propagation and arrest  @xcite .",

    "<S> in particular , a log - normal distribution is now employed to describe the statistics of barrier energies . a high temperature mean - field description of homogeneous macro - plasticity is then developed and is shown to be similar to a thermal activation picture employing a single characteristic activation energy and activation volume . in making this comparison , the activation volume is interpreted as being proportional to the average mean - square - value of the plastic shear strain magnitude within the material . </S>",
    "<S> also , the kinetic fragility at the glass transition temperature is shown to represent the effective number of irreversible structural transformations available at that temperature . </S>"
