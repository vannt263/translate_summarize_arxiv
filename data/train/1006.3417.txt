    "game theory has recently been used as an effective tool to model and solve many security problems in computer and communication networks . in a noncooperative matrix game between an attacker and a defender ,",
    "if the payoff matrices are assumed to be known to both players , each player can compute the set of nash equilibria of the game and play one of these strategies to maximize her expected gain ( or minimize its expected loss ) .",
    "however , in practice , the players do not necessarily have full knowledge of each other s payoff matrix .",
    "for repeated games , a mechanism called fictitious play ( fp ) can be used for each player to learn her opponent s motivations . in a fp process",
    ", each player observes all the actions and makes estimates of the mixed strategy of her opponent . at each stage , she updates this estimate and plays the pure strategy that is the best response ( or generated based on the best response ) to the current estimate of the other s mixed strategy .",
    "it can be seen that in a fp process , if one player plays a fixed strategy ( either of the pure or mixed type ) , the other player s sequence of strategies will converge to the best response to this fixed strategy .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that , for many classes of games , such a fp process will finally render both players playing a nash equilibrium ( ne ) .",
    "specifically , we examine a two - player game , where an attacker ( denoted as player @xmath0 or @xmath1 ) and a defender ( denoted as player @xmath2 or @xmath3 ) participate in a discrete - time repeated nonzero - sum matrix game . in a general",
    "setting , the attacker has @xmath4 possible actions and the defender has @xmath5 posssible actions to choose from .",
    "for example , when @xmath6 , the attacker s actions could be to attack one node in a two - node network , and those of the defender are to defend one of these two nodes .",
    "players do not have access to each other s payoff function .",
    "they adjust their strategies based on each other s actions which they observe .    in a stochastic fp process",
    ", each player makes a maximum likelihood estimation of her opponent s mixed strategy .",
    "as will be seen later on , this will result in a time - varying update of the opponent s empirical frequency , where the weight of the action at time step @xmath7 is @xmath8 . in a practical repeated security game , however , we notice a couple of possible complications .",
    "first , players may not have the exact and synchronized time steps .",
    "second , each player may want to adjust the weight of the other s current action to converge either faster or more accurately to the equilibrium .",
    "a more flexible scheme to update the estimate of the mixed strategy may be needed in such situations .",
    "motivated by these practical considerations , we examine in this paper a time - invariant frequency update mechanism for fictitious play . also , as a side note , such a time - invariant update mechanism will allow us to use the analysis tools applicable only to time - invariant systems .",

    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : tifp ] , we provide an overview of the static game and the standard stochastic fp process , and then introduce the stochastic fp with time - invariant frequency update .",

    "finally , some concluding remarks will end the paper .",
    "in this section , we present first an overview of a two - player static games , then the concept of stochastic fictitious play with time - varying frequency update ( tvfu - fp ) @xcite , and finally the concept of stochastic fictitious play with time - invariant frequency update ( tifu - fp ) .",
