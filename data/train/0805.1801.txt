    "massive stars are formed in the densest regions of molecular clouds ; therefore , molecular spectroscopy of high - density tracers such as rotational lines of hcn and hco@xmath1 molecules in millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths provides us with essential details on the origin of massive stars in galaxies .",
    "they are free from dust extinction ; hence , dust - enshrouded star formation can be unveiled using these observations .",
    "these spectroscopic observations are also expected to be a crucial diagnostic of nuclear power sources of dusty active galaxies , i.e. , a probe to separately assess the nuclear star formation associated with active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "both agns and starbursts will have a strong impact on the surrounding dense interstellar medium ( ism ) and form x - ray dominated regions ( xdrs ) and photo - dissociation regions ( pdrs ) , respectively .",
    "however , they will have drastically different physical and chemical conditions that result in different molecular abundances and excitations between them ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    ", we report our recent progress on extragalactic spectroscopic and continuum observations , including hcn(@xmath0=10 ) , hco@xmath1(@xmath0=10 ) , and cn(@xmath2=10 ) imaging surveys of local seyfert and starburst galaxies using the nobeyama millimeter array ( nma ) , high-@xmath0 co observations ( @xmath0=32 observations using the atacama submillimeter telescope experiment ( aste ; @xcite ) and @xmath0=21 observations with the submillimeter array ( sma ) ) of galaxies , and @xmath3 1.1 mm continuum observations of high-@xmath4 violent starburst galaxies using the bolometer camera aztec ( @xcite ) mounted on aste .",
    "the nma imaging survey of hcn(@xmath0=10 ) and hco@xmath1(@xmath0=10 ) on local seyfert and starburst galaxies ( nma - denss project ; kohno  2001 , 2007 , 2008a ; kohno 2005 ) revealed the presence of `` hcn - enhanced nuclei '' or hens among some of the seyfert galaxies ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "they show elevated hcn intensities with respect to co and/or hco@xmath1 emissions ; i.e. , hcn / co integrated intensity ratios ( @xmath5)@xmath60.3 and/or hcn / hco@xmath1 integrated intensity ratios ( @xmath7)@xmath61.5 in the brightness temperature scale .",
    "they are quite strange or intriguing because no clear evidence of a nuclear starburst is shown despite the fact that hens are very luminous in the hcn emission ( e.g. , the lack of mid - infrared pah emission , see table 1 of kohno  2007 ) .",
    "the absence of hens among starburst galaxies and the detections of highly excited high-@xmath0 co lines in hens ( e.g. , co(@xmath0=32)/co(@xmath0=10 ) integrated intensity ratio of @xmath8 at the center of m 51 , @xcite ; co(@xmath0=21)/co(@xmath0=10 ) of @xmath8 at the center of ngc 1097 , fig .  2 ) could also support the hypothesis that the elevated hcn(@xmath0=10 ) emission is closely connected to the presence of x - ray irradiated dense molecular medium or xdrs .",
    "this idea is successfully applied to local lirgs / ulirgs ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , although further studies will be required to understand the gap between the observations and theories ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "* fig.1 . * the distributions of the observed @xmath5 and @xmath7 ratios at the center of a few 100 pc regions of nearby seyfert and starburst galaxies .",
    "some of the seyfert galaxies exhibit enhanced hcn(@xmath0=10 ) emission with respect to hco@xmath1(@xmath0=10 ) and/or co(@xmath0=10 ) intensities ( hens ) .",
    "hens are never observed among starburst galaxies .",
    "* high - resolution integrated intensity images of co(@xmath0=21 ) and co(@xmath0=10 ) in the central kpc regions of ngc 1097 ( hsieh et al .  2007",
    "; kohno et al .",
    "the co(@xmath0=10 ) emission is dominated by the circumnuclear starburst ring ( indicated by a red circle ) , whereas a strong peak emerges at the center in co(@xmath0=21 ) .",
    "we have also started a pilot survey of the cn(@xmath2=10 ) emission toward nearby starburst and seyfert galaxies using nma .",
    "the cn emission is another strong and important tracer of dense molecular gas after hcn and hco@xmath1 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and cn / hcn integrated intensity ratios ( @xmath9 ) are expected to be enhanced significantly in the pdrs ( @xcite ) and xdrs ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "one of our goals is to obtain spatially resolved cn maps and to compare them with our existing hcn maps ; this will allow us to understand the relative importance of pdr and xdr on the cn abundance .",
    "the instantaneous bandwidth of the nma spectrocorrelator ( 1024 mhz ; @xcite ) enables us to observe @xmath0=@xmath10 and @xmath0=@xmath11 lines ( consisting of hyperfine structure lines ) simultaneously .",
    "their ratios ( hereafter @xmath12 ) can be used to estimate their opacities .",
    "our preliminary results are presented in fig .",
    "all observed starburst galaxies ( including ngc 3079 , which hosts an agn accompanied with a nuclear starburst ) show an @xmath12 of @xmath133 ( i.e. , optically thin ) , implying that cn(@xmath2=10 ) emission can be a useful measure of mass or abundance of dense ism . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath12 was found to be close to unity ( 1.4 @xmath14 0.15 within the central @xmath15 ) at the center of ngc 1068 , suggesting that these lines are almost optically thick .",
    "this could be due to a significant increase in cn abundance at the center of ngc 1068 , a prototypical giant xdr ( @xcite ) .",
    "we then computed the @xmath9 values for two positions of ngc 1068 , i.e. , the center and the circumnuclear starburst region .",
    "there was no significant difference in the @xmath9 values between the nucleus and starburst region ( @xmath9 was around 1.5 for both positions ) .",
    "this could indicate that _ both _ cn and hcn abundances are significantly elevated in the xdr of ngc 1068 .",
    "again , these results appear somewhat inconsistent with theoretical predictions ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and we do require further studies both observationally and theoretically",
    ".     * fig.3 . * a part of cn(@xmath2=10 ) spectra in the central regions of local starburst and seyfert galaxies taken with the nma in the d - configuration ( the observing beam sizes are typically @xmath16 ) .",
    "we have conducted co(@xmath0=32 ) imaging observations of nearby star - forming galaxies ( adios project ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) in order to depict star - forming dense molecular material in the disk regions of galaxies , where high - density tracers such as hcn and hco@xmath1 molecules are very weak .",
    "even with the single pixel receiver of aste 345 ghz band , the excellent atmospheric conditions of atacama , good performance of the antenna and receiver , and efficient otf mapping mode ( @xcite ) enable us to rapidly produce wide area co(@xmath0=32 ) maps .",
    "based on these data , a tight and linear connection between star formation rates ( sfrs ) and the amount of dense molecular gas traced by the co(@xmath0=32 ) emission is revealed ( fig .  4 ) .",

    "see also komugi  ( 2007 ) .",
    "to uncover the hidden dusty massive star formation in the early universe , we have started a deep @xmath3 1.1 mm continuum imaging survey toward various blank fields and biased regions ( such as proto - cluster forming regions around high - z radio galaxies , and so on ) using the 144-pixel bolometer camera aztec ( @xcite ) mounted on aste .",
    "a typical map size is @xmath20 or wider , and a typical 1 @xmath21 noise level is @xmath131 mjy or lower , allowing us to investigate large scale distributions / structures of smgs ( i.e. , @xmath13 a few 10 mpc scales ) with a sufficient sensitivity to detect hyper luminous ir galaxies ( i.e. , @xmath22 ) in the early universe .      in the ly@xmath18 selected proto - cluster region ssa 22 , about a 390 arcmin@xmath24 region",
    "was deeply observed .",
    "we found a very poor spatial correlation between the detected 1.1 mm sources and the ly@xmath18 sources ( laes and labs ) , which was consistent with a previous finding in the tn j1338 - 1942 field ( @xcite ) . in spite of such a poor overlap between smgs and laes , we found that the bright 1.1 mm sources are concentrated around the density peak of laes , i.e. , a possible excess of number density of smgs around the laes density peak can be observed in our data .",
    "further analysis , including the multiwavelengths follow - up observations to obtain constraints on the source redshifts , is in progress .",
