    "the prevailing theory about the origin and the evolution of our universe is the so - called hot big bang model .",
    "the model is based on two crucial observations : the discovery of the expansion of the universe as characterized by the hubble s law , and the existence of an exceedingly isotropic and a perfectly thermal cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation .",
    "since the energy density of radiation falls faster with the expansion than that of matter , these two observations immediately point to the fact that the universe has expanded from a hot and dense early phase , when radiation , rather than matter , was dominant .",
    "the transition to the more recent matter dominated epoch occurs when the radiation density falls sufficiently low that the photons cease to interact with matter .",
    "the cmb is nothing but the relic radiation which is reaching us today from this epoch of decoupling . while fairly isotropic , the cmb possesses small anisotropies ( of about one part in @xmath0 ) , and the observed pattern of the fluctuations in the cmb provides a direct snapshot of the universe at this epoch .",
    "the hot big bang model has been rather successful in predicting , say , the primordial abundances of the light elements in terms of a single parameter , viz . the baryon - to - photon ratio , and the value required to fit these observations matches the value that has been arrived at independently from the structure of the anisotropies in the cmb . despite the success of the hot big bang model in explaining the results from different observations , the model has a serious drawback . under the model , the cmb photons arriving at us today from",
    "sufficiently widely separated directions in the sky could not have interacted at the time of decoupling .",
    "nevertheless , one finds that the temperature of the cmb photons reaching us from any two diametrically opposite directions hardly differ .",
    "( for a detailed description of the various successes and the few shortcomings of the hot big bang model , and the original references for the different points mentioned above , i would refer the reader to the following texts  @xcite . )",
    "inflation  which refers to a period of accelerated expansion during the early stages of the radiation dominated epoch  provides a satisfactory resolution to above - mentioned shortcoming of the hot big bang model .",
    "in fact , in addition to offering an elegant explanation for the extent of homogeneity and isotropy of the background universe , inflation also provides an attractive causal mechanism to generate the inhomogeneities superimposed upon it .",
    "the inflationary epoch amplifies the tiny quantum fluctuations present at the beginning of the epoch and converts them into classical perturbations which leave their imprints as anisotropies in the cmb .",
    "these anisotropies in turn act as seeds for the formation of the large scale structures that we observe at the present time as galaxies and clusters of galaxies . with the anisotropies in the cmb being measured to greater and greater precision , we have an unprecedented scope to test the predictions of inflation .",
    "as i shall discuss , the simplest models of inflation driven by a single , slowly rolling scalar field , generically predict a nearly scale invariant spectrum of primordial perturbations , which seems to be in excellent agreement with the recent observations of the cmb .",
    "( for a discussion on these different aspects of the inflationary paradigm , in addition to the texts  @xcite , see the following reviews  @xcite . )",

    "sec : i ] , i shall outline how inflation helps to overcome the horizon problem , and illustrate how inflation can be driven with scalar fields .",

    "[ sec : sp ] , i shall conclude with a brief discussion on the status and some prospects of the inflationary paradigm .      before i get down to brass tacks ,",
    "let me list the various conventions and notations that i shall adopt .",

    "i shall set @xmath3 , but shall display @xmath4 explicitly , and define the planck mass to be @xmath5 .",
    "i shall express the various quantities in terms of either the cosmic time  @xmath6 or the conformal time @xmath7 , as is convenient .",
    "an overdot and an overprime shall denote differentiation with respect to the cosmic and the conformal time coordinates of the friedmann metric that describes the expanding universe .",
    "it is useful to note here that , for any given function , say , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 $ ] , where @xmath11 is the scale factor associated with the friedmann metric .",
    "lastly , since observations indicate that the universe has a rather small curvature , as it is usually done in the context of inflation , i shall work with the spatially flat friedmann model .",
    "the different texts  @xcite and the variety of reviews  @xcite that i have already mentioned discuss the motivations for the inflationary scenario , the different models of inflation , the formulation of cosmological perturbation theory , and also how the various models compare with the recent observations . in what follows , i shall typically refer to one or more of these texts or reviews .",
    "i have also tried to refer to the original papers .",
    "however , i should stress that these references are often representative and not necessarily exhaustive .",
    "let me begin by describing the horizon problem in the hot big bang model . consider a spatially flat , smooth , friedmann universe described by line element s^2 = t^2-a^2(t ) ^2 = a^2 ( ) (^2 - ^2),[eq : fle ] where @xmath6 is the cosmic time , @xmath12 is the scale factor , and @xmath13 $ ] denotes the conformal time coordinate . in such a background , the horizon , viz .",
    "the size of a causally connected region , is defined as the physical radial distance travelled by a light ray from the big bang singularity at @xmath14 up to a given time  @xmath6 .",
    "the horizon can be expressed in terms of the scale factor @xmath12 as follows  @xcite : h(t)=a(t)_0^t .",
    "let me now compare the linear dimension of the forward and the backward light cones at the time of decoupling in the hot big bang model .",
    "if one assumes that the universe was dominated by non - relativistic matter from the time of decoupling  @xmath15 until today  @xmath16 , then the physical size of the region on the last scattering surface from which we receive the cmb is given by _ _",
    "b(t_0,t_dec ) = a_dec _ t_dec^t_0 3 (t_dec^2 t_0)^1/3 , where @xmath17 denotes the value of the scale factor at decoupling , and",
    "i have used the fact that @xmath18 in arriving at the final expression . on the other hand , if i assume that the universe was radiation dominated from the big bang until the epoch of decoupling , then the linear dimension of the horizon at decoupling turns out to be _ _",
    "f(t_dec,0 ) = a_dec _ 0^t_dec = (2 t_dec ) .",
    "the ratio , say , @xmath19 , of the linear dimensions of the backward and the forward light cones at decoupling then reduces to  @xcite r ( ) =  ( ) ()^1/3 70 , and the last equality follows from the observational fact that @xmath20 , while @xmath21 . in other words ,",
    "the linear dimension of the backward light cone is about @xmath22 times larger than the forward light cone at decoupling . despite this ,",
    "the cmb turns out to be extraordinarily isotropic .",
    "this is the horizon problem .",
    "there is another way of stating the horizon problem .",
    "note that the physical wavelengths associated with the perturbations , say , @xmath23 , always grow as the scale factor , i.e. @xmath24 .",
    "in contrast , in a power law expansion of the form @xmath25 , the hubble radius , viz .",
    "@xmath26 , goes as @xmath27 , so that we have @xmath28}$ ] .",
    "this implies that , when @xmath29a condition which applies to both the radiation and the matter dominated epochs  the physical wavelength grows _",
    "faster _ than the corresponding hubble radius _ as we go back in time _  @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the primordial perturbations need to be correlated on scales much larger than the hubble radius at sufficiently early times in order to result in the anisotropies that we observe in the cmb .",
    "consequently , within the hot big bang model , any mechanism that is invoked to generate the primordial fluctuations has to be intrinsically acausal .",
    "actually , apart from the horizon problem , there also exist a few other puzzles to which the hot big bang model is unable to provide a satisfactory solution .",
    "these other issues include , the extent to which the universe happens to be spatially flat today ( to about one part in @xmath30 ) , and the unacceptable density of relics that would have been formed when high energy symmetries were broken in the early universe , to name just two . amongst all these issues , the horizon problem is arguably the most significant .",
    "moreover , it so happens that , the inflationary solution to the horizon problem also aids in surmounting the other difficulties as well  @xcite . for these reasons",
    ", i shall restrict my attention to the horizon problem . in the following sub - sections , after illustrating how inflation helps in overcoming the horizon problem , i shall outline how inflation is typically achieved with scalar fields .      as i discussed above , length scales of cosmological interest today ( say , @xmath31 ) , enter the hubble radius either during the radiation or the matter dominated epochs , and are outside the hubble radius at earlier times .",
    "if a causal mechanism is to be responsible for the origin of the inhomogeneities , then , clearly , these length scales should be inside the hubble scales ( i.e. @xmath32 ) in the very early stages of the universe .",
    "this will be possible provided we have an epoch in the early universe during which @xmath23 decreases faster than the hubble radius _ as we go back in time _",
    ", i.e. if we have  @xcite -()<0 , which then leads to the condition that > 0 .",
    "in other words , the universe needs to undergo a phase of accelerated ( inflationary ) expansion during the early stages of the radiation dominated epoch if a physical mechanism is to account for the generation of the primordial fluctuations .    in order to illustrate these points , in fig .  [",
    "fig : emdird ] , i have plotted @xmath33 , where ` length ' denotes either the physical wavelength of a mode or the hubble radius , against @xmath34 , during inflation and the radiation dominated epochs  @xcite .    for convenience ,",
    "i have chosen to describe inflation by the power law expansion @xmath35 , with @xmath36 .",
    "in such a situation , while @xmath24 during all the epochs , the hubble length @xmath37 behaves as @xmath27 and @xmath38 during inflation and the radiation dominated epochs .",
    "evidently , all these quantities will be described by straight lines in the above plot . whereas the straight lines describing the evolution of the physical wavelengths will have a unit slope ,",
    "those describing the hubble radius during the inflationary and the radiation dominated epochs will have a slope of much less than unity ( say , for @xmath39 ) and two , respectively .",
    "it is then clear from the figure that , _ as we go back in time _",
    ", modes that leave the hubble radius during the later epochs will not be inside the hubble radius during the early stages of the universe _ unless we have a period of inflation .",
    "_      let us now try and understand as to how much inflation we shall require in order to ensure that the forward lightcone from the big bang to the epoch of decoupling is at least as large as the backward light cone from today to the epoch of decoupling , thereby resolving the horizon problem . for simplicity , let me assume that the universe undergoes exponential inflation , say , from time @xmath40 to @xmath41 , during the early stages of the radiation dominated epoch .",
    "let @xmath42 be the constant hubble scale during exponential inflation , and @xmath43 denote the extent by which the scale factor increases during the inflationary epoch . for @xmath44 , the dominant contribution to the size of the horizon at decoupling arises due to the rapid expansion during inflation , and it can be evaluated to be _ _",
    "i(t_dec,0 ) = a_dec _ 0^t_dec  ( ) ()^1/2 a , where i have set @xmath45 . in such a case ,",
    "the ratio of the forward and the backward lightcones at the epoch of decoupling is given by  @xcite r__i  ( )  ( ) and , in arriving at the final number , i have chosen @xmath46 .",
    "clearly , @xmath47 , if @xmath48 . given the scale factor , the amount of expansion that has occurred from an initial time @xmath40 to a time @xmath6 is usually expressed in terms of the number of @xmath49-folds defined as follows : n=_t_i^t",
    "t h = ln ().[eq : n ] since @xmath50 , it is often said that one requires about @xmath51 @xmath49-folds of inflation to overcome the horizon problem @xmath49-folds is roughly an observational upper bound which ensures that the largest scale today is inside the hubble radius during the inflationary epoch  @xcite .",
    "actually , the number of @xmath49-folds needed to resolve the horizon problem depends on the energy scale at which inflation takes place .",
    "for instance , if inflation is assumed to occur at a rather low energy scale of , say , @xmath52 , then , even @xmath53 @xmath49-folds will suffice to surmount the horizon problem . ] .",
    "if @xmath54 and @xmath55 denote the energy density and pressure of the smooth component of the matter field that is driving the expansion , then the einstein s equations corresponding to the line element  ( [ eq : fle ] ) result in the following two friedmann equations for the scale factor @xmath12 : [ eq : fe ] h^2&= &  ( ) , [ eq : fe1 ] +  ( ) & = & - ( ) (+3 p),[eq : fe2 ] where , as i had mentioned , @xmath56 is the hubble parameter .",
    "it is clear from the second friedmann equation that , for @xmath57 to be positive , we require that @xmath58 .",
    "neither ordinary matter ( corresponding to @xmath59 ) nor radiation [ which corresponds to @xmath60 satisfy this condition .",
    "in such a situation , we need to identify another form of matter to drive inflation .",
    "scalar fields , which are often encountered in various models of high energy physics , can easily help us achieve the necessary condition , thereby leading to inflation .",
    "consider a canonical scalar field , say , @xmath61 , described by the potential @xmath62 .",
    "such a scalar field is governed by the action s[]=",

    "-^ _ [ ( )  ( _ ^)-v ( ) ] .",
    "[ eq : setsf ] the symmetries of the friedmann background  viz .",
    "homogeneity and isotropy  imply that the scalar field will depend only on time and , hence , the resulting stress - energy tensor will be diagonal",
    ". therefore , the energy density  @xmath54 and the pressure  @xmath55 associated with the scalar field simplify to [ eq : rhopsf ] t^0_0 & = & = [()+v ( ) ] , [ eq : rhosf ] + t^i_j & = & -p ^i_j = -[()-v ( ) ] ^i_j .",
    "[ eq : psf ] moreover , from the action  ( [ eq : sfa ] ) , one can arrive at the following equation of motion for the scalar field @xmath61 in the friedmann universe : + 3 h+v_=0,[eq : emsf ] where @xmath63 . from the above expressions for @xmath54 and @xmath55",
    ", one finds that the condition for inflation , viz .",
    "@xmath64 , reduces to ^2 < v().[eq : ci ] in other words , inflation can be achieved if the potential energy of the scalar field dominates its kinetic energy .",
    "given a @xmath62 that is motivated by a high energy model , the first friedmann equation  ( [ eq : fe1 ] ) and the equation  ( [ eq : emsf ] ) that governs the evolution of the scalar field have to be consistently solved for the scale factor and the scalar field , with suitable initial conditions .",
    "but , using the expressions  ( [ eq : rhopsf ] ) for the energy density and the pressure associated with the scalar field , the friedmann equations  ( [ eq : fe ] ) can be rewritten as [ eq : hhdot ] h^2 & = &  ( ) [()+v()],[eq : h ] + h & = & - ( ) ^2,[eq : hdot ] where , for convenience , i have set @xmath65 , as i had defined earlier .",
    "these two equations can then be combined to express the scalar field and the potential parametrically in terms of the cosmic time  @xmath6 as follows  @xcite : [ eq : phivt ] ( t)&= & t , [ eq : phit ] + v(t)&= & ^2 (3 h^2+h ) .",
    "[ eq : vt ] if we know the scale factor @xmath12 , these two equations allow us to ` reverse engineer ' the potential from which such a scale factor can arise ! using this procedure , i shall now ` reconstruct ' the potentials of two commonly considered models of inflation .",

    "t^q[eq : ple ] with @xmath36 corresponding to inflation , and @xmath66 being an arbitrary constant .",
    "on substituting this scale factor in equation  ( [ eq : phit ] ) and , upon integration , one can immediately show that the scalar field evolves as  ( ) =  [ ()],[eq : phitple ] where @xmath67 is a constant of integration .",
    "the potential that leads to such a behavior can then be obtained using equation  ( [ eq : vt ] ) , and the above expressions for  @xmath12 and  @xmath68 .",
    "it is found to be  @xcite v ( ) = v_0 -  [  ( ) ] .",

    "since this scale factor grows faster than power law inflation , but slower than exponential expansion , it is referred to as intermediate inflation  @xcite .",
    "the condition  ( [ eq : ci ] ) that the potential energy of the inflaton dominates the kinetic energy is necessary for inflation to take place . however , inflation is _ guaranteed _",
    ", if the field _ rolls slowly _ down the potential such that ^2 v().[eq : csri ] moreover , it can be ensured that the field is slowly rolling for a sufficiently long time ( to achieve the required @xmath51 or so @xmath49-folds of inflation ) , provided (3 h ) .",
    "these two conditions lead to the slow roll approximation  @xcite , which , as we shall see , allows one to construct analytical solutions , both for the background and the perturbations .",
    "the approximation is usually described in terms of what are referred to as the slow roll parameters .",
    "two types of slow roll parameters  the potential slow roll parameters and the hubble slow roll parameters  are often considered in the literature]with @xmath73 being the hubble parameter evaluated at some given time during inflation . ] .",
    "i shall describe these two sets of parameters below , and discuss the solutions for the inflaton and the scale factor for a particular class of potentials in the slow roll approximation .",

    "the two quantities @xmath75 and @xmath76 are referred to as the potential slow roll ( psr ) parameters .",
    "it is straightforward to show that neglecting the kinetic energy term @xmath77 in the friedmann equation  ( [ eq : h ] ) and the acceleration term  @xmath78 in the equation of motion  ( [ eq : emsf ] ) for the scalar field are equivalent to the smallness of these parameters .",
    "however , it should be emphasized that the converse is not true .",
    "the smallness of the psr parameters is only a necessary condition , and it is not sufficient to ensure that these terms can indeed be ignored .",
    "the reason being that the psr parameters only restrict the form of the potential , and not the dynamics of the solutions .",
    "even if @xmath75 and @xmath76 are small , there is no assurance that inflation will take place since the value of @xmath79 can be as large as possible .",
    "therefore , in addition to the two psr parameters being small , the slow roll approximation actually requires the additional condition that the scalar field is moving slowly along the attractor solution determined by the equation : @xmath80 ( for a detailed discussion on this point , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in spite of this shortcoming ,",
    "the psr parameters often prove to be very handy .",
    "for instance , given a potential , they immediately allow us to determine the domains and the parameters of the potential that can lead to inflation .",
    "i shall now discuss two examples to illustrate the utility of these parameters .",
    "consider potentials of the form  @xcite v()=(v_0 ^n),[eq : lfm ] where @xmath67 is a constant and @xmath81 .",
    "let us restrict ourselves to the region @xmath82 wherein @xmath62 is positive for all  @xmath83 . it is straightforward to show that the slow roll conditions [ viz",
    "@xmath84 are satisfied when @xmath61 is much greater than @xmath85 .",
    "since inflation occurs for such large values of the field , these potentials are often classified as ` large field ' models  @xcite .",
    "now , consider the following potential which describes the pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson v()= [1+cos(/f ) ] , where @xmath86 and @xmath8 are constants that characterize the depth and the width of the potential .",
    "this potential ` naturally ' leads to inflation for values of the field that are small when compared to the planck scale  @xcite .",
    "hence , such models are usually referred to as ` small field ' models .",
    "the hubble slow roll ( hsr ) parameters turn out to be a better choice to describe the slow roll approximation than the psr parameters since they do not require any additional conditions to be satisfied for the approximation to be valid .",

    "in such a case , we can write eq .",
    "( [ eq : hhdot ] ) as = -(2 ^2 ) h_,[eq : hphi ] where @xmath88 .",

    "finally , the inflationary condition @xmath95 _ exactly _ corresponds to @xmath96 .",
    "it should again be emphasized that , since the smallness of the hsr parameters ensure that @xmath97 is small , the hsr approximation implies the psr approximation .",
    "but , the converse does not hold without assuming the constraint that the inflaton is already on the attractor  @xcite .",
    "note that the equation of motion of the scalar field  ( [ eq : emsf ] ) and the first friedmann equation  ( [ eq : h ] ) can be written in terms of the two hsr parameters as [ eq : hemsfhsrp ] h^2 [1 -  ( ) ] & = &  ( ) , + (3 h ) [1 -  ( ) ] & = & -v_. the slow roll approximation corresponds to the situation wherein the hsr parameters @xmath90 and @xmath91 satisfy the following conditions : _ _ h 1 , _ _",

    "i shall finally close by briefly commenting on the status and some prospects of the inflationary paradigm .      as a broad concept , inflation",
    "can certainly be considered as a success . however , a specific model of inflation that can be satisfactorily embedded in a high energy theory still eludes us .",
    "a plethora of inflationary models exist , quite a few of which are phenomenological in nature . despite the enormous amount of effort , including attempts at considering models that are not described by the canonical action",
    ", it will be fair to say that we do not yet have a satisfactory model .",
    "the principal hurdle facing the idea of inflation is to construct a model that is well motivated from the high energy perspective , and also fits the observational data well .      in this review ,",
    "i had restricted myself to discussions on slow roll inflation , which leads to a featureless and nearly scale invariant primordial spectrum that seems to agree well with the recent observations of the cmb anisotropies . though the agreement is rather good ,",
    "there also exist a few points at the lower multipoles of the observed cmb angular power spectrum which lie outside the cosmic variance associated with the concordant model .",
    "given these observations , a handful of model independent approaches have been constructed to recover the primordial power spectrum . at the smaller scales ,",
    "all these approaches arrive at a spectrum that is nearly scale invariant .",
    "however , many of the approaches seem to unambiguously point to a sharp drop in power ( along with a few distinct features ) at the scales corresponding to the hubble scale today .",
    "if future observations support the presence of such features in the primordial spectrum , then it poses an interesting challenge to build inflationary models that lead to the required spectrum .",
    "conversely , the necessities of features will considerably restrict the class of allowed models of inflation .",
    "( for various efforts in this direction , see the references listed in refs .",
    "@xcite . )",
    "i had earlier mentioned that the scalar perturbations generated during inflation are gaussian in nature .",
    "i had also clarified that this was primarily due to the fact that we had confined ourselves to linear perturbation theory .",
    "deviations from gaussianity can arise when takes into account the perturbations at the higher orders  @xcite .",
    "however , the extent of the non - gaussianity depends on a variety of reasons ( for a recent discussion on the issue and further references , see ref .",
    "interestingly , recent re - analysis of the wmap @xmath246-year data seem to indicate sufficiently large non - gaussianities ( see , for instance , ref .",
    "if future observations confirm such a large level of non - gaussianity , then , it can result in a substantial tightening in the constraints on the inflationary models .",
    "for example , canonical scalar field models that lead to a nearly scale invariant primordial spectrum contain only a small amount of non - gaussianity and , hence , may cease to be viable  @xcite .",
    "however , it is known that primordial spectra with features can lead to reasonably large non - gaussianities  @xcite . therefore ,",
    "if non - gaussianity indeed turns out to be large , then , either one may have to reconcile with the fact that the primordial spectrum contains features , or one possibly have to seriously consider models described by non - canonical actions , some of which are known to result in large gaussianities ( see , for instance , refs .",

    "<S> this article provides an introductory review of inflation and cosmological perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> i begin by motivating the need for an epoch of inflation during the early stages of the radiation dominated era , and describe how inflation is typically achieved using scalar fields . </S>",
    "<S> then , after an overview of linear cosmological perturbation theory , i derive the equations governing the perturbations , and outline the generation of the scalar and the tensor perturbations during inflation . </S>",
    "<S> i illustrate that slow roll inflation naturally leads to an almost scale invariant spectrum of perturbations , a prediction that seems to be in remarkable agreement with the measurements of the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background . </S>",
    "<S> i describe the constraints from the recent observations on some of the more popular models of inflation . </S>",
    "<S> i conclude with a brief discussion on the status and certain prospects of the inflationary paradigm . </S>"
