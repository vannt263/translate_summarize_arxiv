    "comparisons with values extracted from exact quantum calculations showed that the semiclassical results can be computed with very high accuracy .    however , in the theory presented in @xcite some important topics have not yet been considered .",
    "for example , the @xmath0 corrections can not be calculated for classical orbits which have a turning point ( i.e. , the velocity vanishes completely at this point ) .",
    "furthermore , discrete and continuous symmetries have not been included .    if there are discrete symmetries the eigenstates of the quantum system split up into several subspaces . in these subspaces , classical orbits which are not periodic without a symmetry transformation contribute to the level density .",

    "the regularization of the coulomb singularity can be achieved by introducing semiparabolic coordinates @xcite @xmath132 and the scaled time @xmath133 @xmath134 this transformation leads to the new hamiltonian @xmath135 where the momenta are defined by @xmath136 the scaled time @xmath133 is the parameter for the integration of the differential equations of the classical values . in the case",
    "@xmath137 , the @xmath138 and @xmath139 coordinates , which are only defined as positive coordinates in equation , can be extended to negative values .",
    "then , @xmath140 and @xmath141 have the same structure as the momenta of cartesian coordinates .",
    "this structure of the momenta is very important because it is often used in the derivation of the @xmath0 corrections ( see e.g. equation for the monodromy matrix ) .",
    "however , it can not be found in the quantum mechanical analogue of equation .",
    "starting again with the hamiltonian in cylindrical coordinates @xmath142 and using the transformations and , one arrives at the schrdinger equation for the @xmath143-part of the wave function : @xmath144 in this quantum mechanical expression , the momentum operators for @xmath138 and @xmath139 differ from those in cartesian coordinates even for @xmath145 , which is the quantum analogue of @xmath146 . as was mentioned above , this difference does not have any effect on the leading order of the semiclassical level density .",
    "the results of the classical calculations agree very well with values which were extracted from quantum calculations .",
    "but there is no agreement at all between the classically evaluated correction terms @xmath120 and @xmath147 and quantum mechanical calculations .",
    "this behaviour can be understood , when one introduces the new wave function @xmath148 which leads to the following schrdinger equation : @xmath149 now , the momentum operators agree with the structure in the classical case but an additional term @xmath150 appears , which leads to a non - vanishing centrifugal part of the potential even for @xmath145 .",
    "the additional term has also to be inserted in the classical hamiltonian : @xmath151 since the new centrifugal part is proportional to @xmath152 , which was set to one when atomic units were introduced , it contributes to the first - order @xmath0 correction in the expansion of the level density as one can easily see when one repeats the calculations from section [ sec : derivation ] . that is the reason why the influence of the continuous symmetry does not appear in the leading order but in the first - order corrections .",
    "the centrifugal term consists of an integral over the classical periodic orbit with the kernel @xmath153 , which diverges at the coordinate axes .",
    "this problem does not arise if one regards the hydrogen atom as a purely two - dimensional system because in this case there is no centrifugal term .",
    "the momenta have the structure of the momenta of cartesian coordinates in the classical dynamics as well as in the quantum case .",
    "therefore , in the following sections we only look at this _ two - dimensional hydrogen atom _ for the calculation of the first - order @xmath0 corrections , as it was done in @xcite before .",
    "the two - dimensional diamagnetic hydrogen atom can be formulated similar to the three - dimensional one . for a magnetic field @xmath154",
    ", the classical hamiltonian is given by : @xmath155 if one uses the classical scaling property and semiparabolic coordinates for the two - dimensional case @xcite @xmath156 the transformed hamiltonian reads : @xmath157    the schrdinger equation associated with the classical hamiltonian can be obtained by the same procedure as in the three - dimensional case .",
    "the result is : @xmath158 in this case , the momentum operators have exactly the same structure as for cartesian coordinates .",
    "note that @xmath159 takes the place of @xmath0 , which is equal to one in atomic units and which is often called `` effective @xmath0 '' .",
    "the `` potential '' of the two - dimensional diamagnetic hydrogen atom in semiparabolic coordinates ( see equation ) @xmath160 has a @xmath1-symmetry .",

    "in this paper we extended the theory presented in @xcite to systems with discrete symmetries and the influence of these symmetries on the correction terms was discussed in detail .",
    "the symmetry transformations presented in this paper made possible the calculation of the correction terms for a number of orbits which could not be included without symmetry operations .",
    "nevertheless , these orbits , which are not periodic in the plane of semiparabolic coordinates without a symmetry operation , contribute to some of the subspaces of the quantum spectrum .",
    "the classical results for the correction terms could be compared with values which were extracted from exact quantum calculations .",
    "an excellent agreement between the results of both methods was found .    in spite of this success",
    ", it must be noted that before semiclassical spectra including first - order @xmath0 corrections can be calculated over the complete spectrum a number of problems still remain to be solved .    on the one hand , as was already mentioned in @xcite , and was pointed out in section [ sec : derivation ] , the correction term @xmath120 can not be calculated in the form presented for orbits which have a turning point , but the inclusion of these orbits is essential for the @xmath0 correction of the level density .",
    "the correction term @xmath120 diverges for orbits with turning points .",
    "however , the extraction of the @xmath0 correction terms from quantum spectra with the method presented in section [ sec : quantum_spectra ] leads to results which are on the same order of magnitude as the values of orbits without turning points .",
    "thus we can assume that the reason lies in an insufficiency of the theory , and is not a physical property .    on the other hand",
    ", besides the successfully implemented discrete symmetries , physical systems often have a continuous symmetry .",
    "for example , it is necessary to take into account the rotational invariance around the magnetic field axis for the complete calculation of all first - order @xmath0 corrections to the semiclassical level density of the three - dimensional diamagnetic hydrogen atom . as was mentioned in section [ sec : rot_invariance ] , the problem can be considered as an additional centrifugal term in the potential .",
    "this term leads to diverging integrals if the course of the orbit is not changed .",
    "a regularization of these integrals suggested in @xcite leads to good results for a few individual orbits , however , a mathematical justification is lacking .",
    "furthermore , for the hydrogen atom it would be interesting to look at the @xmath161 level density , @xmath162 , where @xmath161 is the scaling parameter introduced in section [ sec : hinv_quantum_spectra ] , in contrast to the `` energy '' level density . in this case",
