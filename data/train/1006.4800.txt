    "so far there is convincing evidence that the so - called solar and atmospheric anomaly can be well explained through the neutrino oscillation . the mass square differences @xmath5 , @xmath6 and the mixing angles have been measured with good accuracy @xcite .",
    "global fit to the current neutrino oscillation data demonstrates that the observed lepton mixing matrix is remarkably compatible with the tri - bimaximal ( tb ) mixing pattern @xcite , which suggests the following values of the mixing angles @xmath7 this simple structure of the mixing matrix suggests that there may be some symmetry underlying the lepton sector .",
    "recent study @xcite(also in the context of grand unified theories @xcite ) showed that the discrete group @xmath8 is particularly suitable to produce the tb mixing at leading order ( lo ) , if it is properly managed to be broken differently in the neutrino and the charged lepton sector . in the @xmath8 based models",
    ", it seems very difficult and unnatural to generate the correct mass hierarchies and mixing for quarks .",
    "an interesting solution is to enlarge the symmetry group @xmath8 , two non - abelian discrete group @xmath9 @xcite and @xmath3 @xcite have been investigated .",
    "we note that both groups have a doublet representation , which can be utilized to give the 2 + 1 representation assignments for the quarks . in the context of @xmath10 flavor group ,",
    "this assignment has been known to give realistic quark mixing matrix and mass hierarchy @xcite .",
    "the irreducible representations of @xmath9 are those of @xmath8 plus three two dimensional representations @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 with the multiplication rules @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , these ingredients allow us to reproduce the successful u(2 ) predictions in the quark sector . by working only with the triplet and singlet representations ,",
    "@xmath9 is indistinguishable from @xmath8 , thus we can replicate with @xmath9 the successful construction realized within @xmath8 in the lepton sector .",
    "@xmath3 is claimed to be the minimal group which can predict the tb mixing in a natural way , namely without ad hoc assumptions , from the group theory point of view @xcite .",
    "actually the exact tb mixing can be realized in the @xmath3 flavor model @xcite .",
    "moreover , the group @xmath3 as a flavor symmetry , as is shown for example in ref .",
    "@xcite , can also give a successful description of the quark and lepton masses and mixing angles within the framework of @xmath0 or @xmath17 grand unified theory ( gut ) .",
    "for a review of discrete flavor symmetry models , please see the refs.@xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 gut is the simplest grand unified theory @xcite , in this case each generation of the standard model fields resides in @xmath18 and @xmath2 dimensional representations . to be specific",
    ", one family of right - handed down quarks and left - handed leptons are unified in a @xmath18 and the rest fields of the family are in a @xmath2 .",
    "it is well - known that neutrino masses are zero at renormalizable level in the minimal @xmath0 . in gut",
    "neutrino masses come naturally through the see - saw mechanism , where integrating out large masses leads to the appearance of small masses .",
    "however , this requires some extra matter fields or higgs to be added below the gut scale .",
    "a popular choice is to add at least two right - handed neutrinos which are @xmath0 singlets , neutrino masses are generated through type i see - saw mechanism .",
    "the second choice is to introduce a @xmath19-plet of higgs , this is the @xmath0 implementation of the so - called type ii see - saw mechanism .",
    "the third choice is to generate neutrino masses through the combination of type i see - saw with type iii see - saw mechanism by adding at least one matter multiplet in the adjoint @xmath20 representation @xcite .    in this work , we shall construct a supersymmetric @xmath0 model , and the flavor symmetry group is @xmath1 , where the auxiliary symmetry @xmath21 plays an important role in eliminating unwanted couplings , ensuring the needed vacuum alignment and reproducing the observed charged fermion mass hierarchies .",
    "we will introduce three generations of adjoint matter fields to generate the neutrino masses .",
    "we remark that some variants of @xmath22 flavor models have been proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite , where three right handed neutrinos are introduced and the neutrino masses are generated via the type i see - saw mechanism .    the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss the structure of the model , and the leading order ( lo ) results for fermion masses and mixings are presented . in section 3",
    "we justify the choice of the vacuum configuration assumed in the previous section , by minimizing the scalar potential of the theory in the supersymmetric limit . in section 4 the subleading corrections to the vacuum alignment and the lo results of fermion masses and flavor mixings are discussed . in section 5",
    "we study the phenomenological predictions of the model in detail .",
    "finally , section 6 is devoted to our conclusion .",
    "in the following we present our @xmath0 model in the framework of supersymmetry , which simplifies the minimization of the scalar potential greatly .",
    "the @xmath3 group acts as a flavor symmetry of our model , the group @xmath3 has already been studied in literature @xcite , but with different aims and different results .",
    "@xmath3 is the permutation group of four objects , it has five irreducible representations @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath11 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , the group theory of @xmath3 is presented in appendix a. in addition to @xmath18 matter fields denoted by @xmath27 and the tenplet @xmath2 dimensional matter fields denoted by @xmath28 , we introduce the chiral superfields @xmath29 in the adjoint @xmath20 representation @xcite . in the higgs sector",
    "we introduce @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 in order to break the gauge symmetry @xmath0 into the standard model symmetry and subsequently into the residual @xmath33 .",

    "the transformation rules of the matter fields , higgs fields and the flavon fields under @xmath0 , @xmath3 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are summarized in table [ tab : trans ] .",
    "the first and the second generation of the @xmath2 dimensional representations are assigned to be a doublet of @xmath3 , and the third generation of @xmath2 to @xmath41 of @xmath3 .",
    "this assignment is indicated by the heaviness of the top quark .",
    "there is the freedom of choosing the first family or the second family as the first component of the @xmath3 doublet . in this work , the second family @xmath2 is taken to be the first component of the doublet , and the first family as the second component .",
    "if we assign the first family @xmath2 as the first component of the doublet and the second family as the second component as usual , the down quark and strange quark masses would be of the same order and @xmath42 as the first and the second components of the @xmath3 doublet , i.e. , @xmath43 , then @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "we see that @xmath46 and @xmath47 , which are related to the down and strange quark masses respectively , appear simultaneously as the third component of both the combinations @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the operators @xmath50 and @xmath51 combining with the flavon fields or the composition of flavons , which transform as @xmath25 or @xmath26 , contribute to the first two families down quark and charged lepton masses after the @xmath3 and gut symmetry breaking . as a result , the down and strange quark messes would be of the same order except for the case that the @xmath48 and @xmath49 relevant contributions to down quark or strange quark cancel with each other .",
    "we notice that the same view has been put forward by altarelli et al .",
    "whereas if we choose @xmath52 as we proposed , then @xmath53 and @xmath54 , the degeneracy between first two families down quark ( charged lepton ) masses is dissolved . ] without fine tuning unless some special mechanisms are introduced such as ref .",
    "three generation of @xmath55 fields @xmath27 are assigned to @xmath25 of @xmath3 , and three generations of adjoint matter fields @xmath29 are also assigned to be @xmath25 of @xmath3 .",
    "fermion masses and mixings arise from the spontaneous breaking of the flavor symmetry by means of the flavon fields . in the following",
    ", we shall discuss the lo predictions for fermion masses and flavor mixings .",
    "for the time being we assume that the scalar components of the flavon fields acquire vacuum expectation values ( vev ) according to the following scheme @xmath56 we will prove it to be a natural solution of the minimization of the scalar potential in section 3 . furthermore we take the vevs ( scaled by the cutoff @xmath57 ) @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 to be of the same order of magnitude about @xmath64 with @xmath65 being the cabibbo angle , and we will parameterize the ratio @xmath66 by the parameter @xmath67 .",
    "this order of magnitude is indicated by the observed ratios of up quarks and down quarks and charged lepton masses , by the scale of the light neutrino masses and is also compatible with the current bounds on the deviations from tb mixing for the leptons .",

    "these order of magnitudes can be clearly seen from eqs.([ap32],[ap35],[ap38 ] ) , we note that the different suppressions of the shifts are due to the constraint of the flavor symmetry @xmath1 .",
    "in the following , we shall briefly discuss the gut higgs sector of the model in the present effective theory .",
    "our higgs sector is composed of @xmath31 , @xmath34 , @xmath32 , @xmath35 and @xmath30 , the lo @xmath1 invariant interactions between the different higgs chiral superfields in the model are @xmath165 where @xmath166 using the vacuum alignment shown in eq.([ap23 ] ) we can immediately obtain that @xmath167 with @xmath168 since all the higgs fields are neutral under the continuous @xmath169 symmetry , the superpotential eq.([ap40 ] ) explicitly break @xmath169 , while preserve the usual r - parity .",
    "certainly we can construct invariant operators comprising the driving fields , the higgs fields and an arbitrary number of flavon fields , however , these operators do nt contribute to the scalar potential due to the vanishing vevs of the driving fields .",
    "consequently , to completely understand the gut symmetry breaking , maybe we should go beyond the effective theory framework and consider the ultraviolet completion .",
    "symmetry is used to solve the vacuum alignment problem . ]",
    "we note that the effective superpotential in eq.([ap40 ] ) could help us to qualitatively understand the gut symmetry breaking , although this approach is not so satisfactory because of the @xmath169 symmetry breaking . in the context of the ultraviolet completion of the effective model , the terms in eq.([ap40 ] ) could be generated from a @xmath169 conserving superpotential in which the breaking is mediated by additional fields which carry @xmath169 charge .",
    "the ultraviolet completion of the model deserves considerable theoretical work ( please see ref.@xcite for an example of the ultraviolet completion of the @xmath8 model ) , it is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "the scalar potential of the model is determined by the susy @xmath27 terms , @xmath170 terms and soft terms contributions .",
    "we notice that the first two terms in eq.([ap43 ] ) is the interactions for @xmath30 , they are exactly the same as those in the conventional gut theory , this is because that the higgs @xmath30 is neutral under the flavor symmetries , consequently the @xmath0 gut symmetry is broken into the standard model one as usual .",
    "subsequently the vevs of @xmath171 , @xmath34 , @xmath32 and @xmath35 break the standard model symmetry into the residual @xmath33 . recalling that the parameter @xmath172 could be small or large in the minimal supersymmetric standard model",
    ", this means that a hierarchy between the higgs vevs @xmath173 and @xmath174 can be accommodated . in exactly the same way , the minor hierarchy between @xmath175 and @xmath176 in eq.([19 ] ) can be achieved by moderately fine - tuning the parameters in the superpotential @xmath177 .",
