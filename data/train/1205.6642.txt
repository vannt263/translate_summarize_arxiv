    "the photons are absorbed in the cathode , i.e. the absorber , which is a p - type semiconductor .",
    "the cathode material should have a suitably low energy gap so that most of the solar photons are absorbed .",
    "the absorbed photons are themionically emitted from the cathode to vacuum , where they travel to the anode , i.e. the electron collector .",
    "the surface of the cathode should have a low electron affinity in order to have reasonably strong thermionic emission .",

    "the cathode material is described by a single rate equation that neglects many important effects , such as diffusion and realistic recombination . in this article , we present a model that takes the most of the relevant effects in semiconductors into account .",
    "we solve the electron density in the cathode numerically in the general case and derive also a semi - analytical model , which can be used at low injection levels .",
    "silicon is a good candidate for pete due to its rather low band gap , good thermal stability , high availability , cost - efficiency , and good manufacturability .",
    "therefore , we use our models to calculate the characteristics of a pete device with a silicon cathode using experimentally verified material data .",
    "we find that at low temperatures our model predicts a significantly lower efficiency than the model presented in ref . .",
    "the overall temperature and electron affinity dependency of the efficiency differs also from that of ref . .",

    "only the uniform radiative recombination is taken into account with a general model based on the black - body radiation . at low @xmath70",
    "the rate - equation model suggests much higher efficiencies than the present more complete model .",
    "this is mostly due to the facts that all the possible photons are absorbed and the auger recombination is not included in the rate - equation model .",
    "the efficiency is a balance between many opposing effects , which depend on @xmath118 and @xmath52 : increasing @xmath118 increases @xmath71 which increases the efficiency . on the other hand ,",

    "although 5  @xmath115 m is already small thickness for a silicon absorber , but , if @xmath52 is increased to 50  @xmath115 m while keeping @xmath118 constant , the efficiency reduces from 13.0  % to 8.4  % at 550  k in the case @xmath111  ev . at",
    "high @xmath70 the efficiency curves of the present model unite regardless of the differences in @xmath7 .",
    "the reason for this is that the total current does not depend on @xmath7 in this range : when @xmath87 the range @xmath68 can be utilized and the output current density can be written using eqs .   as @xmath120exp@xmath121 - a_a^\\ast t_a^2 $ ] exp@xmath122 .",
    "the rate - equation model does not behave like this at high @xmath70 , because @xmath123 decreases much faster with increasing @xmath70 than in the present model .",
    "this is caused mostly by the differences in the modeling of recombination and the narrowing of the band gap with increasing @xmath70 which is taken into account only in the present model .",
    "the latter effect enhances both photogeneration and thermal generation of electrons , which causes the apparent efficiency increase at @xmath124  k.     as function of the cathode temperature @xmath70 calculated using the numerical ( solid lines ) and semi - analytical ( dotted lines ) models with @xmath125  cm / s , @xmath126  ev , @xmath112  @xmath113 , and @xmath114  @xmath115 m at the concentration of 1000 suns . ]",
    "the effect of @xmath127 on the efficiency of the pete device is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eff_sn ] : even a low value of @xmath127 reduces the efficiency remarkably .",
    "similar results were also obtained with various values of @xmath128 .",
    "the efficiency is more sensitive to @xmath128 than @xmath127 because photogeneration is much stronger near the front surface than near the back surface .",
    "the semi - analytical model is in a very good agreement with the numerical model when the recombination velocities are @xmath129  cm / s since the injection level is below 0.1 at @xmath130  k. in the low - injection conditions achieving surface recombination velocities less than 100  cm / s requires usually use of back surface field structures @xcite .",
    "however , the surface recombination velocity decreases rapidly when the injection level is increased @xcite and values below 2  cm / s can easily be reached at injection level of unity ( details depend on the properties of the surface states ) @xcite . therefore , the case of zero surface recombination can actually be realistic for a pete device .",
    "in summary , we have built a theoretical model for pete devices .",
    "our model takes electron diffusion , inhomogeneous photogeneration , and bulk and surface recombination into account . in comparison to the rate equation model of ref .",
    "our model predicts different dependency of efficiency on such paramaters as cathode electron affinity and temperature . in most cases",
    "our model also predicts lower efficiency .",
    "especially , the surface recombination present on real surfaces can reduce the efficiency to extremely low values .",
    "however , the surface recombination might have only a very weak effect on the performance , since the pete device works often in the high - injection conditions where the surface recombination can be rather small @xcite .",
    "we finally point out that the realization of the pete device requires choices of many parameter values and materials which should all be optimized .",
    "in addition , the heat balance between the pete device and the heat engine coupled to the anode , which was not considered in this article , should be managed as well .",
    "full optimization with heat balance modelling will be left for future studies .",
