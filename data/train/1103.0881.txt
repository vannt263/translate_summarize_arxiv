    "monolithic si pixel sensors have become an established technology for precision vertex tracking in particle physics and in charged particle detection and photon imaging .",
    "commercial bulk cmos is the most commonly adopted process for monolithic active pixel sensors ( maps )  @xcite .",
    "maps are being successfully applied to particle physics experiments  @xcite , imaging in transmission electron microscopy  @xcite and photon imaging  @xcite .",
    "however , maps in bulk cmos technology have several limitations .",
    "first , only nmos or pmos transistors can be built without disturbing the signal charge collection .",
    "then , the charge collected from the thin epitaxial layer is small , limiting the achievable signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the collection occurs through diffusion in an almost field - free region , which results in a long charge collection time and , possibly , increased sensitivity to radiation damage .",
    "the silicon on insulator ( soi ) technology makes it possible to fabricate cmos circuits on a thin si layer , insulated from the handle wafer by a buried oxide layer ( box ) .",
    "a high - resistivity si handle wafer provides a sensitive volume that can be biased , thus improving both the speed of the charge carriers collection and the quantity of charge carriers generated by an ionising particle .",
    "vias through the box connect the substrate to the electronics layer , where both nmos and pmos transistors can be built .",
    "the appealing features of the soi technology for developing pixel detectors were recognised a decade ago in a pioneering study  @xcite .",
    "it has been with the availability of a commercial soi process with small feature size cmos from the collaboration between kek , tsukuba and oki industries inc . that a systematic r&d effort on soi pixel detectors has started  @xcite .",
    "the kek - oki process has special vias cut into the box to contact the underlying handle wafer and collect the charge signal .",
    "a technology proof of principle for charged particle tracking was obtained with the successful test of a prototype in oki 0.15  @xmath1 m soi technology on a particle beam  @xcite . together with the detection of the first particles in the soi pixels , one of the main challenges for the further development of the technology appeared .",
    "the bias applied to the high resistivity substrate induces a potential below the cmos electronics layer which is shielded only in part by the box .",
    "this potential acts as a back - gate to the transistors shifting their thresholds . as a result of this `` back - gating '' effect",
    ", the charge sensing and read - out electronics could only be operated for low to moderate depletion voltages @xmath2 , up to 15 - 20  v , and thus the charge was collected by a depleted region of modest thickness . in that prototype sensor a series of guard - rings was used to counter the back - gating effect .",
    "guard - rings take considerable space in the pixel and are only partially effective . instead",
    ", the implant of a buried @xmath3-well ( bpw ) beneath the box and the transistors has been found to successfully screen the potential applied to the high resistivity layer in single transistor test structures  @xcite .",
    "this motivates the adoption of a bpw in the design of pixel cells immune from back - gating .    in this paper",
    "we present the characterisation of a prototype pixel chip fabricated in oki 0.2  @xmath1 m soi technology , which implements different pixel cells designed to minimise the back - gating effect .",
    "the prototype chip , named `` soimager-2 '' derives its global architecture from the earlier `` soimager-1 '' chip  @xcite . in order to optimise the design of the pixel cell for mitigating the back - gating effect and enhancing the charge collection , pixel cells of different design",
    "are implemented .",
    "the chip is manufactured by oki industries inc .  in 0.2  @xmath1 m soi technology on @xmath4-type soi wafers with a nominal resistivity of the handle wafer of 700  @xmath5 cm .",
    "the sensitive area is a 3.5@xmath63.5  mm@xmath7 matrix of 256@xmath6256 pixels arrayed on a 13.75  @xmath1 m pitch . in order to increase the speed of",
    "the serial read - out , the pixel matrix is divided into four parallel arrays of 64 columns each .",
    "each array is connected to four identical parallel output analog stages .",
    "both the pixel cell and the ancillary electronics are designed and tested to operate at up to 50  mhz read - out frequency .",
    "the chip read - out implements a global shutter .",
    "guard - rings are implemented around the pixel matrix ( @xmath8 i / o ) and the peripheral i / o electronics ( @xmath8 outer ) in order to insulate the transistors from the effect of the potential below the box .",
    "the pixel cell keeps the same 3 t design of the earlier prototype for the whole matrix , but the pixel array is now divided into eight different sectors , each implementing a different layout .",
    "these layouts explore different diode size , configuration of floating and grounded guard - rings around the pixel , as well as the use of a buried p - well , bpw . in this paper",
    "we report results for two pixel cell designs with no @xmath3-type guard - ring and bpw connected to the pixel diode .",
    "one pixel cell has a 1.5  @xmath1 m diode with a large bpw layer extending just beneath the transistors .",
    "the second design features a larger diode ( 5  @xmath1 m ) with a bpw layer which extends below the diode only .",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath10 characteristics are obtained in the laboratory to determine the evolution of the leakage current with the depletion voltage , the breakdown voltage and to estimate the thickness of the depleted region . the sensor is then tested in the laboratory with short ir laser pulses of various wave - lengths and x - rays .",
    "the laser diode is driven by a fast voltage pulse applied through a bias - tee which feeds the laser with a constant current .",
    "a 2  ns - long laser pulse is generated , transported using a single - mode optical fibre and focused to a @xmath11  5  @xmath1 m spot on the pixel front surface .",
    "the detector is mounted on a remotely controlled precision stage , which allows us to vary its position with an accuracy of @xmath12  1  @xmath1 m .",
    "the laser pulse is triggered in phase with the detector data acquisition cycle and has an adjustable delay .",
    "laser tests allow us to measure the charge carrier signal and collection time as a function of @xmath13 . by varying the laser spot position along pixel rows and columns , the charge sharing on neighbouring pixels",
    "is also investigated .",
    "x - rays are used to calibrate the pixel and study the linearity of its response with deposited charge .",
    "we use 5.9  kev x - rays from @xmath14fe sources and 8.04  kev fluorescence radiation from a cu target illuminated with a monochromatic synchrotron radiation beam at the lbnl advanced light source ( als ) .",
    "the response to energetic charged particles is studied with 200  gev/@xmath15 @xmath16 on the h4 beam - line at the cern sps .",
    "three soimager-2 sensors have been arranged in a beam telescope configuration ( see figure  [ fig : evt ] ) .",
    "the first two chips , spaced by 9.4  mm , are mechanically aligned and surveyed using a metrology machine before installation into a doublet unit .",
    "the third chip , located 36  mm downstream ( called singlet in the following ) , is installed on a remotely controlled rotation stage .",
    "after installation on the beam - line , the three sensors have been aligned by optical survey . the final alignment is performed using particle tracks .",
    "data is acquired at a rate of @xmath17150 events s@xmath18 during the 9.8  s - long sps extraction spill .",
    "the detector temperature is kept stable at ( 20@xmath191 )  @xmath20c by flowing cold air inside the optical enclosure housing the detectors .    for the lab and beam tests ,",
    "the chip is mounted on a mezzanine board , which carries four analog pre - amplifiers , each receiving the signal from one of the four chip analog outputs .",
    "signals are routed into differential lines and the signals are fed to the data acquisition system through 1  m - long twisted pair cables with standard usb connectors .",
    "the data acquisition system consists of an analog board pigtailed to a commercial fpga development board , used as control unit  @xcite .",
    "both boards are powered by a stand - alone integrated power supply , which also supplies the detector bias .",
    "the analog board has five independent analog differential inputs , four of which have been used to read - out one analog output from each of the detectors in the doublet and two outputs of the singlet .",
    "each differential input stage feeds a 100  ms / s 14-bit adc .",
    "the control board has a xilinx virtex-5 fpga which supplies the clocks and the slow control signals driving the sensor chips and routes the digitised data to a high speed fifo to be formatted and transferred to the daq computer via a usb-2.0 link at a rate of 25  mbytes / s .",
    "most of the measurements have been performed with the chip clocked at 12.5  mhz , corresponding to 80  ns read - out time per pixel .",
    "the noise of the preamplifier stage and the read - out chain is 1.8  adc counts .",
    "data sparsification is performed on - line in the daq pc using a custom root - based  @xcite program .",
    "sensors are scanned for seed pixels with signal exceeding a preset threshold in noise units .",
    "for each seed , the 7@xmath67 pixel matrix centred around the seed position is selected and stored on file . during the sps beam test",
    "the pixel pedestal and noise values are updated at the end of each spill in order to follow possible drifts in their baselines .",
    "data are stored in root format and subsequently converted into lcio format  @xcite for offline analysis .",
    "the data analysis is based on a set of custom processors in the marlin reconstruction framework  @xcite , which perform cluster centre - of - gravity reconstruction and cluster shape analysis , as well as track fitting for the beam test  @xcite .",
    "the final analysis of the sparsified data is performed offline .",
    "clusters are reconstructed applying a double threshold method on the matrix of pixels selected around a candidate cluster seed .",
    "clusters are requested to have a seed pixel with a signal - to - noise ratio , s / n , of at least 5.0 and the neighbouring pixels with a s / n in excess of 3.0 .",
    "clusters consisting of a single pixel are discarded .",
    "the cluster position is calculated as the centre of gravity of the measured pulse height . in the test with high energy pions ,",
    "particle tracks are reconstructed using a straight line model , since the multiple scattering can be neglected at 200  gev .",
    "we request the track slope in both coordinates to be smaller than 3@xmath610@xmath21 .",
    "when we use all the three planes to reconstruct the tracks we also require the fit @xmath22 to be below 5 .",
    "when we study the efficiency and the single point resolution we use only pairs of hits on the two layers not used as detector under test ( dut ) .",
    "given the low particle density and the high read - out speed there are on average 0.86 hits / layer in non - empty events .",
    "this greatly simplifies the pattern recognition .",
    "the average reconstructed track multiplicity in non - empty events is 0.66 .",
    "an example event display with two reconstructed particle tracks and the response of a cluster of pixels to a single pion hit are shown in figure  [ fig : evt ] .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : res ]      finally , we study the cluster shape as a function of the angle between the incident pion track and the normal to the detector plane on the singlet plane of the telescope . the change of the cluster shape as a function of the angle of incidence is important for assessing the detector response to forward tracks in a vertex tracker with a barrel layout and to low momentum background particles  @xcite . in the beam test the angle of incidence",
    "is varied remotely by operating the rotation stage between 0@xmath20 and 20@xmath20 .",
    "we take 200  gev @xmath16 tracks which have associated hits on all three planes and characterise the cluster shape as the number of pixels along rows and columns in the cluster associated to the pion track on the third plane . since the rotation axis is parallel to the pixel columns we expect to observe an increase of the multiplicity along the column and a constant average number of pixels along the rows .",
    "figure  [ fig : angle ] shows the average number of pixels along columns and rows in clusters on the third plane as a function of the detector angle .",
    "a prototype pixel chip in oki 0.20  @xmath1 m soi technology with 13.75  @xmath1 m pixel pitch has been designed , processed and characterised in the laboratory with x - rays and short ir laser pulses and on a cern sps beam - line with 200  gev @xmath16 .",
    "the use of a buried @xmath3-well implanted beneath the buried oxide avoids the back - gating effect and the tested chip demonstrates for the first time large charge collection , high efficiency and micron resolution in a beam test .",
    "the chip can be properly operated to voltages @xmath2370  v , corresponding to an estimated thickness of the depleted region @xmath23125",
    "@xmath1 m .",
    "we study the evolution of the collection time for the charge generated by a 980  nm laser in front illumination as a function of @xmath13 and measure collection times below 20 ns for @xmath24 50  v. the hit reconstruction efficiency for high energy pions has been measured to be @xmath230.99 and the single point resolution ( 1.12@xmath190.03 )  @xmath1 m , for @xmath24 50  v. these results are very encouraging for the further development of pixel sensors in soi technology for applications demanding particle reconstruction with high spatial resolution and efficiency .",
