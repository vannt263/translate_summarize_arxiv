    "as originally proposed by zhang and rice @xcite , a bound state formed by two holes on the same plaquette is a natural quasiparticle in hole - doped copper oxides .",
    "called a zhang - rice ( zr ) singlet in the case of opposite spins , this quasiparticle consists of a singlet pair of holes , where one is localized on the cu@xmath3 ion and the other is delocalized on surrounding ligand oxygens . in the undoped two - dimensional cuprates",
    ", the zr singlet appears upon removing an electron from the cuo@xmath0 plaquette @xcite . in the doped case",
    ", recent experimental results have demonstrated that the zr singlet remains stable in the ground state at all doping levels across the superconducting dome up to the metallic overdoped regime @xcite .",
    "these findings confirm that the zr singlet picture has a relevant role in the description of the electronic properties of the high - t@xmath4 cuprates at all dopings @xcite .",
    "in addition , zr singlet excitations have been observed in several one - dimensional corner - sharing cuprates by using electron spectroscopies @xcite .",
    "the existence of the zrs has been also confirmed in the edge - sharing cuprate systems @xcite , with the use of rixs @xcite among other techniques .",
    "in particular , the zr singlet has been predicted in these materials @xcite , especially in the final state of the rixs process @xcite , and has recently been observed in li@xmath1cuo@xmath1  and cugeo@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "there are two important energy scales for the creation of zr excitations observed in undoped cuprate materials by rixs : first , a hole has to be excited from the cu site to an o site , which involves the charge transfer energy @xmath6 .",
    "second , the excited hole on the o site must bind to the hole on the central cu site with a binding energy @xmath7 .",
    "it is of great relevance to have direct experimental access to these quantities , as they are fundamental to the physics of correlated materials based on cuo@xmath0 plaquettes .",
    "we have chosen li@xmath1cuo@xmath1  for investigating the physics of zr quasiparticles in a simplified quasi - one - dimensional material .",
    "this prototypical realization of the edge - sharing chain cuprates is made out of cuo@xmath0 plaquettes without apical oxygens . despite its low dimensionality , this system develops long range magnetic order below @xmath8  k , where collinear ferromagnetic ( fm ) intrachain correlations and alternating antiferromagnetic ( afm ) interchain correlations are thought to be realized @xcite .    here , we investigate the electronic excitations of li@xmath1cuo@xmath1  with rixs and x - ray absorption spectroscopy performed at the o @xmath2-edge @xcite , revealing rich spectra showing peculiar charge transfer excitations .",
    "distinct excitonic zr singlet excitations are observed and are attributed to both intra- and interchain excitations .",
    "their nature is further investigated by means of temperature dependent rixs measurements .",
    "this method allows us to probe not only the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) intrachain magnetic correlations , but also the nn interchain magnetic correlations .",
    "moreover , we also extract the zr binding energy , @xmath7 , from the energy loss position of the zr singlet and the charge transfer energy @xmath6 , which permits us to identify the zr triplet excitonic excitation in the rixs spectra .",
    "finally , our results confirm the intrachain long - range ferromagnetic order and the interchain antiferromagnetic order in this material , emphasizing the capability of rixs in probing short range magnetic correlations .",
    "experiments were performed at the adress beamline @xcite of the swiss light source , paul scherrer institut , using the saxes spectrometer @xcite .",
    "rixs spectra were typically recorded with a 2h acquisition time , achieving statistics of 100 - 150 photons on the peaks of interest ( see below ) .",
    "a scattering angle of @xmath9 was used and all the spectra were measured at the specular position ( at an incidence angle of @xmath10 ) , meaning that no momentum is transferred from the photons to the system along the chain direction . all spectra were acquired with @xmath11polarization of light .",
    "the combined energy resolution was 60 mev at the o k - edge ( @xmath12 ev ) .",
    "li@xmath1cuo@xmath1single crystals @xcite ( which are hygroscopic crystals ) were cleaved in - situ at the pressure of about @xmath13 mbar and at 20 k , producing mirrorlike surfaces .",
    "the surface was oriented along the ( 101 ) direction , so that the cuo@xmath0 plaquettes were 21@xmath14 away from the surface .",
    "this means that the electric field of @xmath11polarized light was lying partially out of the plaquette plane , its main component in the plaquette being along the @xmath15direction .",
    "all of the rixs spectra presented here are normalized to the acquisition time , if not stated differently .",
    "scalar - relativistic density functional theory ( dft ) electronic structure calculations were performed using the full - potential fplo code @xcite , version fplo9.01 - 35 .",
    "the parametrization of perdew - wang @xcite was chosen for the exchange - correlation potential within the local density approximtion ( lda ) .",
    "the calculations were carried out on a well converged mesh of 1152 @xmath16-points in the first brillouin zone to ensure a high accuracy for details in the electronic density of states .",
    "for the lda@xmath17 calculations , the around - mean - field ( amf ) double counting correction was applied .",
    "the calculations were carried out using the experimental crystal structure @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath18 used in the dft calculations differs from the respective parameter @xmath19 in the cluster model : the @xmath18 is applied to all cu-@xmath20 basis states in the dft calculations , whereas the @xmath19 acts on the 3@xmath21 states in the core hamiltonian of the @xmath22-hubbard model .",
    "naturally , this requires a considerably smaller @xmath18-value for the dft calculations ( including a slight basis dependence therein ) .",
    "xas and rixs calculations were carried out using the kramers - heisenberg formalism @xcite , where the initial , intermediate , and final states are obtained from small cluster exact diagonalization ( ed ) .",
    "the calculation details are similar to those given in ref .",
    "@xcite . in order to model the interchain coupling , we considered a cluster formed from the two cuo@xmath0 plaquettes with open boundary conditions that were bridged by a single li atom .",
    "the unoccupied li orbitals substantially increased the size of the hilbert space .",
    "our cluster therefore contained a limited orbital basis consisting of a single cu @xmath23 orbital on each cu site , the o @xmath24 orbital on each oxygen site , and an effective @xmath25 state on the li site .",
    "the intra - plaquette hamiltonian includes nearest - neightbor cu - o and o - o hopping with @xmath26 and @xmath27 ev , respectively .",
    "the inter - plaquette o - li hopping was taken to be @xmath28 ev .",
    "the onsite energies for the cu , o , and li orbitals were @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 ev , respectively .",
    "the on - site hubbard interactions for the cu @xmath20 and o @xmath32 orbitals were also included with @xmath33 and @xmath34 ev .",
    "all parameters are given in hole language .",
    "the initial and final states were obtained for this cluster by diagonalizing the problem in the @xmath35 hole sector with three spin up and three spin down holes .",
    "the intermediate states were found by diagonalizing in the @xmath36 hole sector , with the inclusion of an additional core - hole potential @xmath37 ev on the oxygen site where the core hole was created . finally , the reader should note that we have observed significant finite size effects in our previous work @xcite for the rixs spectra when we have performed calculations on smaller single - chain clusters .",
    "therefore the rixs spectra shown in the main text should be considered as a simple qualitative description of the system .",
    "during a rixs experiment performed at the o @xmath2-edge , light excites directly an electron from an o @xmath38 core state into an o @xmath32 valence state . however ,",
    "due to the hybridization of the o @xmath32 states with the cu @xmath20 states in the cuo@xmath0 plaquettes , the excited electron can also fill a cu @xmath20 state .",
    "such a process can lead to the creation of an zr exciton on a plaquette as a final state .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] ( a ) .",
    "starting from an initial state with two neighboring cuo@xmath0 plaquettes on a single chain with both cu in a @xmath39 configuration , written in short @xmath40 , a rixs intermediate state @xmath41 ( with one hole in the o 1s states , @xmath42 ) is reached , deexciting afterwards to a final state @xmath43 ( @xmath44 denotes a ligand hole ) . comparing the initial to the final state",

    "<S> cuprate materials , like those hosting high temperature superconductivity , represent a famous class of materials where the correlations between the strongly entangled charges and spins produce complex phase diagrams . several years ago </S>",
    "<S> the zhang - rice singlet was proposed as a natural quasiparticle in hole - doped cuprates . </S>",
    "<S> the occurance and binding energy of this quasiparticle , consisting of a pair of bound holes with antiparallel spins on the same cuo@xmath0 plaquette , depends on the local electronic interactions , which are fundamental quantities for understanding the physics of the cuprates . here </S>",
    "<S> , we employ state - of - the - art resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs ) to probe the correlated physics of the cuo@xmath0 plaquettes in the quasi - one dimensional chain cuprate li@xmath1cuo@xmath1 . by tuning the incoming photon energy to the o @xmath2-edge </S>",
    "<S> , we populate bound states related to the zhang - rice quasiparticles in the rixs process . </S>",
    "<S> both intra- and interchain zhang - rice singlets are observed and their occurrence is shown to depend on the nearest - neighbor spin - spin correlations , which are readily probed in this experiment . </S>",
    "<S> we also extract the binding energy of the zhang - rice singlet and identify the zhang - rice triplet excitation in the rixs spectra . </S>"
