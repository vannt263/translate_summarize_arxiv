    "in this section we discuss the results of our simulated samples and summarize their physical context and implications .    figure [ vel1 ] shows the theoretical relationship between outflow velocity and bolometric luminosity .",
    "the curvature we see in @xmath52 of set  2 ( and also set  1 , filled circles , our line of sight is along the flow , see below ) , is due to the quadratic dependence of the luminosity with @xmath52 given by equation [ vout1e ] .",
    "it is worth noticing that if we assume a force multiplier of @xmath85 ( this is the best - fit value for set  2 and set  4 , see section [ model1 ] ) ; we are able to reproduce the range of luminosities seen in figure 4 of @xcite .",
    "on the other hand this model is not reproducing well the dispersion we observe in figure ( 4 ) of @xcite , which could be explained by the fact that equation [ vout1e ] will give radially accelerated flows , or in other words , that we are observing all the objects radially along the flow . to include the effect of observing random line - of - sights transversely through different sections of the flow we connect the observed velocity @xmath86 with the intrinsic radial velocity , i.e. @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the angle between the outflow direction and the line of sight . then using the same luminosities produced by set  2 , but plotting ( open squares ) against 1000 @xmath86(s )",

    "it is easy to see that set  4 , resembles better the plot shown in figure 4 of @xcite , taking into account the possible incompleteness of the sample .",
    "doing the same for the ufos , we use the luminosities produced by set  1 ( @xmath91 , this is the best - fit value for set  1 and set  3 , see section [ model1 ] ) but plotting ( open squares ) against 1000 @xmath86(s ) randomly computed using a random generator of numbers ( with @xmath89 ) , and equation [ vout1e ] with @xmath87 , to produce the sub - sample set  3 . in this case",
    "set  3 , better resembles the relationship between @xmath52 and luminosity ( see figure [ vel2 ] ) .    in figure [ vel2 ]",
    "we place both classes of outflows together along with observational points taken from two samples of objects : 14 points out of the 23 objects reported by @xcite ( the others either did not report outflow velocity or were unknown ) , in the right panel ; and 19 points from the sample of 19 objects were ufos have been detected by @xcite , in the left panel .",
    "there are several interesting facts about the plot : ( 1 ) _ the observational points _",
    "cover @xmath92 orders of magnitude in velocity ; ( 2 ) they cover @xmath93 orders of magnitude in bolometric luminosity ( from @xmath94 erg / s ) ; and ( 3 ) that our proposed model is able to reproduce most of the low - velocity points ( 11/14 ) ( two of the points might fall in the high - velocity set instead ) and , less stringently , half of the points for the high - velocity set ( 11/19 ) , using one physical acceleration mechanism and three free parameters : mass of the bh ( @xmath54 ) , outflow velocity ( @xmath52 ) and force multiplier ( @xmath95 ) . on the other hand , there are two sectors where the deviations between model and theory are large : ( 1 ) the high - velocity / low luminosity ; and ( 2 ) the low - velocity / high luminosity , both requiring a closer inspection to the completeness of the samples , and/or the addition of other acceleration mechanisms , like magnetic thrust for instance .",
    "but , this may be the topic of future work .",
    "we propose here that the low- and high - velocity outflows can be accelerated by the same physical mechanism ( as is suggested by figure [ vel2 ] ) ; i.e. , radiation pressure , and that the differences depend on the values of the 3 fundamental parameters : mass of the bh ( @xmath54 ) , the object luminosity ( @xmath53 ) and force multiplier ( @xmath95 ) . _",
    "the values of @xmath95 we have used are of the orders of those found in observational ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and theoretical ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) works_. however , detailed photoionization computations are required to verify if the opacity of the gas under the physical conditions presented here can overcome the over - ionization problem @xcite , and are left for future work .    the anisotropic property of the radiation is basically demanded by the existence of obscured and un - obscured ( type 1 and type 2 ) agns @xcite , and it explains the decreasing of type 2 agns as a function of the x - ray luminosity @xcite .",
    "it is also intrinsically linked to the existence of the dusty torus1000 k ) optically and geometrically thick gas in approximate rotational and virial equilibrium at @xmath371 pc @xcite . ] and it gives the natural frame to locate our two classes of outflows .",
    "if comparable with the escape velocity of the system ( a black hole of @xmath96  m@xmath28 ) , fast - outflow , @xmath97c , locates escape radius at @xmath98 ( schwarzschild radius , @xmath99 ) .",
    "this is very close to the smbh , and the origin is likely the accretion disk .    again , using @xmath100 , as escape velocity from a @xmath101  @xmath45 bh , locates the gas at @xmath102 pc , well beyond the event horizon of the bh , and the broad line region ( blr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well , where the dusty torus is thought to be located .",
    "for the first time , an exploration on the relationship between bolometric luminosity and outflow velocity , for two classes of x - ray outflows in a large sample of active galactic nuclei has been performed .",
    "we find that : ( 1 ) line radiation pressure is an efficient mechanism to accelerate the low - velocity ( @xmath103 ) gas we observe in the classical @xmath21 warm absorber .",
    "( 2 ) it might also become efficient to accelerate the high - velocity ( @xmath104 ) gas we observe in the ufos .",
    "( 3 ) they both might be placed in the same context of anisotropic radiation pressure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    however , there are many open questions , which will require close investigation and detailed modeling . in the first place",
    "the fact that we are assigning one type of outflow to different portions of the parameter space ( @xmath54 , @xmath53 and @xmath95 ) , does not preclude the existence of both in the same object .",
    "also , careful studies of the connection between these outflows observed in x - rays and outflows seen in other bands of the electromagnetic spectrum , uv , infrared or optical ( multi - wavelength studies ) are important points to be addressed .",
    "finally the close inspection of the main parameters of the system ( @xmath105 and @xmath95 ) with cosmological parameters ( like redshift ) is of high relevance , and might be the topic of future works .",
