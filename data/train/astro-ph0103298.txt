    "studying the clustering properties of stars in star - forming regions is a necessary input towards understanding the formation and evolution of young stellar clusters ( elmegreen & efremov 1997 ) . using two - point angular correlation functions to analyse the spatial distribution of stars , gomez et al .",
    "( 1993 ) showed that young stars in the taurus - auriga molecular cloud form in small associations containing of the order of ten stellar systems .",
    "larson ( 1995 ) extended this investigation by taking into account the results from different searches for binary companions to the pre - main sequence stars in the taurus - auriga region .",
    "he computed the mean surface density of companions , @xmath2 , per star as a function of angular separation @xmath3 .",
    "this statistical measure is closely related to the two - point correlation function but does not require normalisation .",
    "as two different power laws are necessary to fit the data , with a slope @xmath4 for separations below @xmath5pc and with a slope @xmath6 above , larson concluded that there are two distinct clustering regimes . at small separations ,",
    "the derived companion density is determined by binaries and higher - order multiple systems , whereas at large separations the overall spatial structure of the stellar cluster is observed .",
    "larson interpreted the observed non - integer slope in the clustering regime as evidence for fractal structure of the cluster .",
    "in addition , larson noted that the break of the distribution occurs in taurus - auriga at length scales which are equivalent to the typical jeans length in molecular clouds , corresponding to a jeans mass of @xmath7m@xmath8 .",
    "he speculated that stellar systems with smaller separations form from the fragmentation of single collapsing proto - stellar cores , whereas the spatial distribution on larger scales is due to the hierarchical structure of the parent molecular cloud .",
    "these results prompted the reanalysis of the taurus - auriga data by other authors ( simon 1997 , bate , clarke & mccaughrean 1998 , gladwin et al .",
    "1999 ) , as well as the subsequent investigation of additional star - forming regions .",
    "mean surface densities of companions as a function of angular separation have been derived for orion ( simon 1997 , bate et al .",
    "1998 , nakajima et al .  1998 ) , for the @xmath9-ophiuchus cloud ( simon 1997 , bate et al .",
    "1998 , nakajima et al .",
    "1998 , gladwin et al .  1999 ) , and for the star - forming regions in chamaeleon , vela and lupus ( nakajima et al .  1998 ) .",
    "common to all studies is that the companion surface density is best described as a double power - law , with slopes of @xmath4 in the binary branch and slopes between @xmath10 and @xmath11 in the large - scale clustering regime .",
    "however , the length scales where the break of the distribution is found to vary considerably , from @xmath12au in the trapezium cluster in orion , over @xmath13au in ophiuchus and @xmath14au in taurus , to @xmath15au for the orion ob region .",
    "this fact raises considerable doubts about the interpretation of the break location as being determined by the jeans conditions in the cloud .",
    "this would imply quite different jeans masses which in turn should lead to deviations of the initial mass function , which have not been observed .",
    "a thorough theoretical evaluation of the mean surface density of companions , @xmath2 , and a discussion of viable interpretations can be found in bate et al .",
    "altogether the following picture emerges : at small separations , @xmath2 traces the separations of binary stars and higher - order multiple stellar systems .",
    "the slope @xmath4 results from the frequency distribution of binary separations being roughly uniform in logarithm ( duquennoy & mayor 1991 , for main sequence stars ) .",
    "the break occurs at the ` crowding ' limit , i.e.  at separations where wide binaries blend into the ` background ' density of the cluster . at larger separations",
    ", @xmath2 simply reflects the large - scale spatial structure of the stellar cluster .",
    "bate et al .  (",
    "1998 ) pointed out that @xmath2 can be strongly affected by boundary effects and that a non - integer power - law slope in the cluster branch does not necessarily imply fractal structure .",
    "they showed that a simple core - halo structure , as is typical for evolved stellar clusters , will result in a non - integer slope for separations larger than the core radius .",
    "they also speculated about possible effects of dynamical cluster evolution on the properties of @xmath2 .",
    "it is the aim of the present paper to investigate , for the first time , evolutionary effects on @xmath2 as derived from realistic @xmath1-body computations .",
    "we use models studied by kroupa ( 1995a , b , c , 1998 , hereinafter k1-k4 ) for a comparison with a ` standard ' dynamical analysis , where the binary population is analysed separately from the bulk cluster properties . for comparison , the mean surface density of companions for models of _ proto_stellar clusters that form and evolve through turbulent molecular cloud fragmentation is discussed in klessen & burkert ( 2000 , 2001 ) .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in the next section (  [ sec : msdc ] )",
    "we mathematically define the mean surface density of companions , @xmath0 , and briefly discuss its limitations . in  [ sec : models ] we describe the star cluster models and their properties . in ",
    "[ sec : evolutionary - effects ] , we investigate the influence of cluster evolution on @xmath0 and in particular discuss wide - binary depletion .",
    "the effects of averaging and projection are analysed in ",
    "[ sec : statistical - effects ] , and a possible observational bias is discussed in  [ sec : observational - bias ] .",
    " [ sec : morphology ] discusses features in @xmath2 and their relation to cluster morphology .",
    "finally , our results are summarised in ",
    "[ sec : summary ]    [ cols=\">,<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     ( 16 , 8) ( 0.4 , 0.0 )    the figure shows that the quantities are well correlated .",
    "specifically , we find ( the uncertainties are mean absolute deviations ) @xmath16 and @xmath17 this suggests that the break points in @xmath0 can be used to infer the core radius and half - mass radius of a cluster .",
    "we also find good correlations between @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) and between the break points in @xmath0 ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the above scaling relations apply for the specific low - mass cluster models that we investigate .",
    "these models do not suffer significant core collapse , which is partly given by the relatively fast evaporation time ( @xmath22  gyr , k3 ) , and the ubiquitous binary stars which oppose core collapse .",
    "more massive clusters are likely to show different correlations , notably between @xmath18 and @xmath23 , and between @xmath24 and @xmath25 , since core collapse leads to the contraction of @xmath19 but an expansion of @xmath18 ( giersz & spurzem 2000 ) .",
    "analysis of more massive clusters using @xmath0 is a future goal , and it will be interesting to see if correlations  [ eqn : corr1 ] and  [ eqn : corr2 ] remain valid .",
    "in this paper , we investigate how dynamical cluster evolution is manifest in the mean surface density of companions , @xmath0 , as a function of separation @xmath26 .",
    "we find that throughout all evolutionary phases , @xmath0 can be subdivided into four distinct branches , each following approximately a power - law behaviour :    1 .   at small separations , and throughout all evolutionary phases of the star cluster ,",
    "@xmath0 traces binary stars and higher - order multiple systems . in the binary branch",
    "the slope of the companion density is approximately @xmath27 .",
    "+ the binary population keeps a memory of the dynamical evolution of star clusters .",
    "the depletion of the binary population at large separations leads to a steepening of @xmath0 in the wide - binary branch . in extreme cases",
    ", it may become completely depopulated and a gap between binaries and the cluster branch opens up .",
    "the gap increases with cluster age and with increasing initial density . for the binary branch ,",
    "@xmath0 is sensitive to the initial properties of the system , so that analysing @xmath0 for a cluster can constrain its birth configuration .",
    "the well - defined binary branch blends into a plateau of constant companion density which corresponds to the main body of the stellar cluster , and which we refer to as the cluster branch in @xmath0 .",
    "the transition occurs at separations when chance projections of cluster members begin to outnumber the contribution of binary stars in that separation bin .",
    "the location of this _ first _ break at @xmath24 depends on the binary fraction and the central stellar density of the cluster , and thus on @xmath19 .",
    "as the cluster expands , the density decreases and the core radius increases with @xmath28 for the set of models studied here . as a consequence , the binary branch becomes less affected by crowding and the first break in @xmath0 shifts to greater separations .",
    "generally , as the cluster evolves the plateau ` decreases in height ' and ` moves ' to larger separations .",
    "larger parts of the binary branch are ` uncovered ' as a result of the expansion and the formation of wide hierarchical systems through capture .",
    "3 .   relaxed galactic clusters exhibit a core / halo structure .",
    "this becomes apparent in @xmath0 through the existence of a second break at @xmath25 , which is approximately located at the half - mass radius , @xmath29 , beyond which @xmath0 decreases again .",
    "the slope of this halo branch depends sensitively on the evolutionary state of the cluster .",
    "if the cluster is still sufficiently young so that most of it is confined well inside it s tidal radius , then @xmath0 decreases rapidly .",
    "however , relaxed clusters that fill their tidal radii have a halo branch with a slope of approximately @xmath27 .",
    "4 .   beyond the tidal radius ,",
    "the density of unbound stars decreases gradually , which is reflected in a fourth branch in @xmath0 .",
    "it is a measure of the density distribution of the moving group relative to the centre of its origin , which is the star cluster .",
    "the decay of @xmath0 is steeper here because the stars are finally removed from the vicinity of the cluster within an orbital period about the galaxy ( terlevich 1987 ) .",
    "the mean surface density of companions closely reflects morphological properties of stellar clusters .",
    "the break points in @xmath0 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , therefore can be used to infer the core radius @xmath19 and half - mass radius @xmath18 of a cluster .",
    "these quantities are well correlated , and we find @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "altogether , @xmath0 contains valuable information on the dynamical state of a star cluster , and allows an assessment of cluster properties such as the core and half - mass radii . as the location of the first break in @xmath0 ( or",
    "the possible occurrence of a gap between binary and cluster branch ) depends on the binary fraction and on the initial central density , these parameters can in principle be inferred from analysing @xmath0 .",
    "our study confirms that different projections of the same data do not change @xmath0 significantly during the evolution of initially spherical clusters in the galactic tidal field .",
    "also , different numerical renditions of the same models lead to indistinguishable results .",
    "hence , they can be combined to improve the statistical significance of the ensemble average @xmath0 .    to allow for a proper assessment of stellar cluster properties using @xmath0 , it is important to consider as complete a census of cluster stars as possible .",
    "observational bias ( i.e. non - detection of faint stars ) may complicate the interpretation of @xmath0 and limit its applicability for inferring the initial stage of the cluster under study ( see also bate et al .",
    "our tests show , however , that @xmath0 remains a useful quantity even when stars with @xmath32m@xmath33 are not detected .",
    "we also find that mass segregation is evident in @xmath0 through the location of the second break in dependence of the mass - range used to construct @xmath0 .",
    "future analysis of numerical models of rich clusters , for which mass segregation and possibly core collapse play important roles in the late phases of the dynamical evolution , will be performed to deepen the issues raised in this pilot study .",
