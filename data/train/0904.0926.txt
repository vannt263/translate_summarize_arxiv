    "the notion of a _ weyl group _ is crucial in linear algebraic group theory  @xcite .",

    "weyl groups are special examples of _ finite coxeter groups_. hence , they possess a group presentation of a particular type , and an associated length function .",
    "it turns out that this presentation and this length function are deeply related with the geometry of the associated algebraic group .",

    "therefore it is natural to look for such a theory , and , therefore , to address the question of monoid presentations for renner monoids . in  @xcite ,",
    "we considered the particular case of the _ rook monoid _ defined by solomon  @xcite .",

    "let us postpone to the next sections some definitions and notations , and state here our main results .",
