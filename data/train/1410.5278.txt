    "over the past two decades a great and increasing interest has been devoted to study the transport and scattering properties of matter or classical waves in non - hermitian periodic potentials , i.e. in the so - called complex crystals ( see , for instance , [ 1 - 31 ] and references therein ) . among them , parity - time ( @xmath0 ) symmetric complex crystals , which possess a real - valued energy spectrum below a symmetry - breaking point @xcite , have attracted a huge attention , especially since the proposal @xcite and experimental realizations @xcite in optics of synthetic periodic optical media with tailored optical gain and loss regions .",
    "complex crystals show rather unique scattering and transport properties as compared to ordinary ( hermitian ) crystals , such as violation of the friedel s law of bragg scattering @xcite , double refraction and nonreciprocal diffraction @xcite , unidirectional bloch oscillations @xcite , mobility transition and hyper ballistic transport @xcite , and unidirectional invisibility @xcite .",
    "one among the most investigated @xmath5-symmetric complex crystals is the one described by the sinusoidal complex potential @xmath6 , which is amenable for an exact analytical study @xcite . in the infinitely - extended crystal , this periodic potential is gapless and shows a countable set of spectral singularities , which are the signature of the @xmath0 symmetry breaking transition . for a finite crystal of length @xmath1 containing a finite number @xmath7 of unit cells , it was shown by simple coupled - mode theory that in the limit of a shallow potential the crystal is unidirectionally invisible , i.e. it is transparent and does not reflect waves when probed in one propagation direction @xcite .",
    "one - way invisible crystals with sophisticated shape and structure have been also synthesized by application of supersymmetric ( susy ) transformations of the sinusoidal complex crystal at its symmetry breaking point @xcite .",
    "unidirectional invisibility holds for thin and shallow enough crystals , a condition which is typically satisfied in optical experiments @xcite . however , for thick crystals the transparency and unidirectional reflectionless properties of the sinusoidal complex potential break down and the scattering scenario comprises three distinct regimes , as shown in refs.@xcite by an exact analysis of the scattering problem involving modified bessel functions beyond coupled - mode theory . an open question remains whether there exist @xmath0-symmetric complex crystals that remain unidirectionally invisible as @xmath4 .    in this work we introduce a new class of exactly - solvable complex periodic potentials which are transparent and unidirectional reflectionless ( at any degree of accuracy ) over a broad frequency interval around the bragg frequency and that remain unidirectionally invisible as the crystal length @xmath1 becomes infinite .",
    "such complex crystals are super symmetrically associated to an hermitian square potential well of length @xmath1 and height @xmath8 . in the limit of small @xmath8 ,",
    "the partner complex crystal is almost unidirectional invisible , even in the @xmath4 limit , and its shape differs from the complex sinusoidal potential at the symmetry breaking point , previously considered in refs.@xcite , mainly for a bias of the real part of the potential , which avoids breakdown of transparency as @xmath4 .",
    "let us consider the stationary schrdinger equation for a quantum particle in a locally periodic and complex potential @xmath9 , which in dimensionless form reads @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the energy of the incident particle and @xmath9 is the complex scattering potential with period @xmath12 , which is nonvanishing in the interval @xmath13 . in dimensionless units used here @xmath12 is taken to be of order @xmath14 , for example @xmath15 .",
    "the crystal length @xmath1 is assumed to be an integer multiple of the lattice period @xmath12 , i.e. @xmath16 , where @xmath7 is the number of unit cells in the crystal . as discussed in refs.@xcite , eq.(1 ) can also describe bragg scattering of optical waves from a complex grating of period @xmath12 and length @xmath1 at frequencies close to the bragg frequency .",
    "our aim is to synthesize a complex periodic potential @xmath9 which is almost unidirectional invisible over a broad frequency range around the bragg frequency and that remains unidirectionally invisible in the @xmath17 limit . to this aim ,",
    "we use susy transformations ( see e.g. @xcite ) to realize isospectral partner potentials , one of which being almost bidirectionally invisible and corresponding to a shallow square potential well .",
    "let us indicate by @xmath18 the hamiltonian corresponding to the potential @xmath19 , and let @xmath20 be a solution ( not necessarily normalizable ) to the equation @xmath21 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath22 can be then factorized as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is the so - called superpotential .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath27 , obtained by intertwining the operators @xmath28 and @xmath29 , is called the partner hamiltonian of @xmath22 .",

    "this yields @xmath87 the reflectance is equal for both left and right incidence sides and it is given by @xmath88     ( for left and right incidence sides , upper plots ) and transmittance @xmath89 ( lower plots ) of the complex crystal @xmath9 , defined by eq.(10 ) , for @xmath45 , @xmath47 and for increasing number @xmath7 of cells : ( a ) @xmath74 , ( b ) @xmath90 , and ( c ) @xmath91 .",

    "the scattering properties of the complex crystal defined by eq.(10 ) are readily obtained from those of the partner square well potential @xmath19 using the property ( ii ) of susy stated in the previous section . for a plane wave with momentum @xmath68 incident from the left side of the crystal",
    ", the solution to the schrdinger equation @xmath105 ( @xmath70 ) in the @xmath71 and @xmath72 regions is given by @xmath106 where @xmath107 and @xmath108 are the transmission and reflection ( for left incidence ) coefficients , respectively , and @xmath109 is an arbitrary non - vanishing constant . on the other hand , according to the property ( ii ) stated in the previous section for @xmath33 , i.e. for @xmath110 , one has @xmath111 . from eqs.(14 ) and ( 21 ) , taking into account that @xmath112 for @xmath71 and @xmath72 , it follows that @xmath113 and @xmath114 similarly , from the problem of a plane wave with momentum @xmath68 incident from the right side of the crystal one obtains @xmath115 the case @xmath116 , i.e. @xmath117 , can be analyzed by considering the limit of eqs.(22 ) and ( 23 ) as @xmath118 .",
    "in particular , from eq.(23 ) one has @xmath119 as @xmath118 , whereas from eqs.(18 ) and ( 22 ) a 0/0 limit is obtained , which yields after some calculations @xmath120 as @xmath118 . from the above results , the following scattering properties of the complex crystal , with potential @xmath9 given by eq.(10 ) , can be stated : + ( i ) the transmission coefficient @xmath107 of the complex crystal is the same as that @xmath76 of a square well of width @xmath1 and height @xmath8 , see eq.(17 ) .",

    "this is shown in fig.3 , where typical behaviors of spectral transmittance @xmath89 and reflectances @xmath137 for increasing values of @xmath16 are depicted .",
    "note that , as @xmath7 increases the spectral reflectance @xmath126 remains smaller than @xmath138 , the transmittance @xmath89 remains close to 1 , whereas the spectral reflectance @xmath125 shows a peak at @xmath139 , which increases as @xmath7 is increased [ according to eq.(27 ) ] .",
    "the scattering properties of the potential ( 10 ) are thus very distinct than the ones of the complex sinusoidal potential at the symmetry breaking point , @xmath135 , for which transparency is lost as @xmath7 is increased @xcite .",
    "this is shown in fig.4 , where the solid line shows the behavior of spectral transmittance of the complex sinusoidal potential for @xmath47 , @xmath45 and @xmath91 , i.e. for the same parameter values as in fig.3(c ) .",
    "note that near the bragg wave number @xmath140 the transmittance @xmath141 greatly deviates from 1 . as discussed in ref.@xcite , such a deviation is the signature of the spectral singularity of the complex sinusoidal potential that arises in the @xmath4 limit . for a small value of @xmath8 , the potential ( 10 ) is well approximated by the _ shifted _ complex sinusoidal potential @xmath142 , see eq.(13 ) .",
    "hence transparency of the complex sinusoidal potential is expected to be restored provided that the _ bias _",
    "@xmath66 is added to the potential .",
    "this is shown in fig.4 , where the dashed curve depicts the numerically - computed behavior of the spectral transmittance for the _ shifted _ sinusoidal complex potential @xmath142 .",
    "as one can appreciate from the figure , the addition of the bias @xmath66 to the complex sinusoidal potential restores the transparency .",
    "in this work bragg scattering in a new class of super - symmetrically synthesized @xmath0-symmetric complex crystals has been analytically investigated .",
    "the crystal turns out to be almost transparent and unidirectionally reflectionless , i.e. one - way invisible .",
    "unidirectional invisibility has been predicted and recently observed in the sinusoidal complex potential at the symmetry breaking point , see @xcite .",
    "however , while transparency is lost for the complex sinusoidal potential for thick crystals @xcite , in the super - symmetrically synthesized complex crystal considered in this work unidirectional reflectionless and transparency properties hold regardless of the crystal thickness , i.e. they persist in the limit @xmath4 .",
    "the reason thereof is that the spectral transmittance of the super - symmetrically synthesized complex crystal is the same as that of a shallow square well potential , which remains close to one regardless of the thickness @xmath1 of the well . in the limit of a very shallow potential well",
    ", we have shown that the super - symmetrically associated complex crystal reduces to the complex sinusoidal potential at the symmetry breaking point , _ but _ with an additional bias of the potential , which prevents breakdown of transparency in the @xmath4 limit ."
