    "itinerant ferromagnetism ( fm ) is not only a representative strong - correlation problem , but also a highly non - perturbative one @xcite .",
    "it is widely known as a long - standing problem of condensed matter physics , and also a current research focus in ultra - cold atom physics @xcite .",
    "the stoner mechanism states that polarized electron systems can save the exchange interaction energy .",
    "nevertheless , because of the associated cost of kinetic energy , fm is not guaranteed even in the presence of very strong repulsions . for example , in rigorously one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems , no matter how strong the repulsive interactions are , the ground state is always a spin singlet , which is known as the famous lieb - mattis theorem @xcite . in other words , electrons can remain unpolarized but avoid each other to reduce interaction , nevertheless , their wave functions are strongly - correlated . certainly the lieb - mattis theorem in 1d only applies for spin - independent systems .",
    "ferromagnetism in 1d is still possible if the interaction is spin - dependent .    because of the strong correlation nature of itinerant fm , exact theorems are important to provide reference points .",
    "nagaoka s theorem is an early example , which applies to the infinite @xmath5 hubbard model with a single hole in the half - filled background @xcite .",
    "the fully polarized fm state facilitates the hole s coherent motion , which minimizes the kinetic energy of the hole and is therefore selected as the ground state .",
    "another class of fm theorems is based on the flat band structure on line graphs @xcite .",
    "because of the divergence of density of states in the flat band , the kinetic energy cost because of spin polarization is suppressed .",
    "metallic fm states with a dispersive band structure have also been proved @xcite .",
    "recently , a ground state fm theorem has been proved in both two - dimensional ( 2d ) square and three - dimensional ( 3d ) cubic lattices systems with multiorbital structures @xcite .",
    "the band structure behaves like decoupled orthogonal 1d chains ; while , different chains are coupled at their crossing site through multiorbital hubbard interactions . in particular , spins of each chain are not conserved but coupled by hund s interaction .",
    "hence , the ground state fm ordering is genuinely 2d or 3d .",
    "different from nagaoka s theorem , the result of multiorbital fm allows a stable fm phase over a large region of filling factors in both 2d and 3d .",
    "an important consequence of this theorem is that the sign structure of the many - body hamiltonian matrix leads to the absence of the quantum monte - carlo ( qmc ) sign problem @xcite .",
    "consequently , qmc simulations on finite temperature thermodynamic properties of itinerant fm have been performed @xcite , which yield asymptotically exact results and shed light on the mechanism of magnetic phase transitions in the strong - coupling limit .    in this article",
    ", we generalize nagaoka s theorem of itinerant fm from the single orbital system to multiorbital systems .",
    "we consider the 3d cubic lattice and each site consists of three @xmath0 orbitals : @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "each orbital has a planar orientation , and the associated band structure is quasi-2d like .",
    "electrons of different orbitals interact through the on - site multiorbital interactions including hund s coupling . in the limit of intra orbital interaction @xmath6 ,",
    "states with doubly occupied orbitals are projected out .",
    "when each plane of the cubic lattice has one and only one hole in the in - plane orbital band , this system can be be viewed as crossing layers of nagaoka fm states .",
    "we prove that , in this limit , the ground state of this system is the fully spin - polarized itinerant ferromagnetic state , and it is non - degenerate apart from the trivial spin degeneracy .",
    "furthermore , when this system is reduced to a single 2d layer system of @xmath0 orbitals , the @xmath3 and @xmath2 orbital bands become quasi-1d and coupled to the quasi-2d band of @xmath1 through hund s coupling .",
    "the ground state fm is still valid , where the quasi-1d @xmath3 and @xmath2 bands are allowed to take general values of filling , while , the @xmath1 band can possess a single hole or be fully filled .",
    "although the above exact results require an idealized strong - coupling limit , the strong correlation physics that they imply sheds important light on the mechanism of itinerant fm in transition metal oxides .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "in this section , we define a 3d multiorbital hubbard model in the 3d cubic lattice , which will be shown to possess itinerant fm ground states under conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) in sec .",
    "[ sect:3d ] .",

    "the wannier wavefunction of the @xmath0 orbitals is planar - like as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : orbital ] .",
    "the kinetic energy of each orbital band exhibits a 2d structure : say , for electrons in the @xmath1 orbital , they can only move in the @xmath8-plane with a hopping amplitude @xmath9 .",
    "however , their hopping amplitude @xmath10 along the transverse direction of the @xmath11 axis is very small .",
    "the in - plane hopping @xmath9 is assisted by the @xmath12 orbitals of oxygen anions lying at the middle point of the bond , which leads to large hopping amplitudes ; while , the transverse hopping @xmath10 can only be attributed to the direct overlap between two @xmath1 orbitals offset along the @xmath11 axis . since @xmath13 orbital wannier functions are nearly localized and the @xmath11 axis is perpendicular to the orbital plane , @xmath9 is negligible in realistic transition metal oxides .",
    "similarly , electrons in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 orbitals only hop along the @xmath14 and @xmath15-planes , respectively .    because of the different parity eigenvalues of these three @xmath0 orbitals with respect to the @xmath8 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15-planes",
    ", they do not hybridize by the nearest neighbor hopping .",
    "if we neglect the longer range hopping terms , the kinetic energy part can simply be written as h^k = h^k_xy + h^k_yz + h^k_zx , where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 are the kinetic energies of electrons in the @xmath8 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 orbital bands , respectively .",

    "later , we choose @xmath9 positive . for the bipartite lattice such as the cubic one , the sign of @xmath9 can be flipped by a gauge transformation , which does not affect any physical observable .",

    "similarly , @xmath24 can also be defined by permuting the indices of orbitals and hopping directions in @xmath16 , whose expressions are not repeated here .",

    "the @xmath5 term is the usual intra orbital hubbard interaction ; the @xmath31 term is the inter orbital hubbard interaction ; the @xmath32 term is hund s coupling with @xmath33 ; and the @xmath34 term describes the singlet pairing hopping process among different orbitals .",
    "the expressions of @xmath5 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath34 are presented in appendix [ appdx : parameter ] following the standard physical meaning of two - body coulomb interactions .",

    "the hamiltonian of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : kin ] ) and ( [ eq : hint ] ) conserves particle number in each orbital band in each plane parallel to the orbital orientation .",

    "further , condition ii restricts one and only one hole for each orbital band in a layer . in each given hilbert space @xmath38 , each state",
    "is determined by the location of the hole and the spin configuration at other sites .",

    "we first define the basis for the local moments for the half - filled @xmath1 band , which can be ordered in an arbitrary way as    arbitrary spin distribution .",
    "then for the combined system , the basis is defined as | , _ _ , _ |\\{}. again because of spin conservation , the hilbert space in this case @xmath146 can be further decomposed into the direct sum of different sectors of @xmath48 s as @xmath147 .    similarly to theorem 2 , the off - diagonal elements of the hamiltonian matrix is non - positive .",
    "we next show the transitivity of the hamiltonian matrix in each physical sub - hilbert space @xmath148 .",
    "again , we only need to show that for any state in @xmath148 , opposite spins of any two electrons can be exchanged by applying hopping and hund s interaction without affecting other parts of the system .",
    "the proof is very similar to that of theorem 2 , nevertheless , a new situation needs to be addressed : both electrons are in the @xmath1 band with spin-@xmath78 and -@xmath23 , respectively .",
    "their locations are denoted as @xmath21 and @xmath149 , respectively .",
    "then we can choose an electron in the @xmath3 band , and , without loss of generality , assume its spin-@xmath78 .",
    "then according to the proof of theorem 2 , we can first flip the pair of electrons @xmath150 and @xmath151 , then their spins become @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "next , we consider the pair of @xmath152 and @xmath154 and exchange their spins .",
    "the net result is the exchange of the spins of two @xmath1 electrons .    with both results of non - positivity and transitivity",
    ", it is also straightforward to arrive at corollary 3 by similar proof of theorem 1 . _",
    "although theorems 1 and 2 are under ideal conditions and limits , they do have close connections to realistic systems of transition - metal oxides . for the multiorbital hubbard hamiltonian of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : kin ] ) and ( [ eq : hint ] ) , they are actually a good approximation of the @xmath0 orbital systems of transition metal oxides in 3d . for example , the itinerant fm srruo@xmath4 belongs to this class of materials @xcite , which is a @xmath0-active material of 4@xmath13 electrons in a cubic lattice .",
    "even though , typical interaction strength in the 4@xmath13 electron systems are intermediately strong , it already exhibits the fm phase with @xmath155 .",
    "furthermore , the magnetic moment of this system is observed as 1.6@xmath156 per site with the electron filling in srruo@xmath4 as four electrons per site .",
    "therefore , the fm ground state stated in theorem 1 would possibly persist to the intermediate interaction regime and with finite electron or hole density away from half - filling .",
    "nevertheless , the magnetization would be no longer fully polarized but partially polarized to save the kinetic energy cost .",
    "another important system is the laalo@xmath4/srtio@xmath4 interface between two component insulators .",
    "this interface is experimentally found metallic and ferromagnetic with large magnetization @xcite .",
    "this is a @xmath0 orbital active material with 3@xmath13 electrons in 2d layered systems , whose @xmath3 and @xmath2 are quasi-1d orbital bands while its @xmath1 orbital forms the quasi-2d band . for 3@xmath13 electrons ,",
    "the interaction strength is stronger than that of 4@xmath13 materials .",
    "the rkky , itinerant , and double - exchange mechanisms were proposed to explain the fm in this system @xcite.here , we have shown that the ground state itinerant fm is fully spin polarized and robust for general densities in the @xmath3 and @xmath2 bands under strong intra orbital interactions .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the nagaoka type itinerant fm in @xmath0 orbital systems in a 3d cubic lattice . the hole motion in each orbital band is constrained in the plane parallel to the orbital orientation .",
    "effectively , this system behaves as crossing planes of 2d nagaoka fm coupled by on - site inter orbital hund s coupling .",
    "consequently , 3d itinerant fm ground states are developed , which are proved fully polarized and unique apart from the trivial spin multiplet degeneracy .",
    "also , we have considered the 2d layer of @xmath0 orbital systems : the quasi-1d bands are itinerant with arbitrary generic fillings and the quasi-2d band can have a single hole or be half - filled .",
    "its ground state is shown remaining the fully spin - polarized itinerant fm .",
    "the theorems established in this article can be helpful for further understanding the mechanism of fm in srruo@xmath4 and the transition - metal oxides interface .",
