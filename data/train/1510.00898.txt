    "within the past decades great progress has been achieved in hadron spectroscopy @xcite . especially , inspired by the observation of exotic states @xcite ( such as the candidate for the tetraquark @xcite or pentaquark @xcite state etc . ) , the underlying structure of these states attracts much attention both in theory and experiment .",
    "observation of the exclusive photoproduction of exotic hadronic states off baryons , proposed in the refs .",
    "@xcite , is the most direct way to get information about their nature . at higher energies",
    "such processes can be described in terms of regge trajectory exchanges pd77,vg09 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath2 and @xmath3 photoproduction were studied with the reggeized model .",
    "it is found that the reggeized model gives a good description for these reactions in and beyond the resonance region .",
    "thus the photoproduction reaction at high energy may be appropriate to study the role of reggeized treatment .    in the 1950s , regge proved the importance of extending the angular momentum @xmath4 to the complex field @xcite . for more general reviews about the regge theory ,",
    "later , the exchange of dominant meson regge trajectories was used to successfully describe the hadron photoproduction @xcite .",
    "however , there is one question : has the regge trajectory approach been well tested by experiment at higher energies ?    in the past , the @xmath0 ( @xmath5 ) photoproduction",
    "was extensively studied .",
    "the estimation of the exclusive photoproduction cross section for @xmath6 has been performed according to the one - pion exchange ( ope ) mechanism with absorption in @xcite .",
    "the experimental results for the values and energy dependence of this cross section at relatively low ( @xmath720 gev ) energies are quite consistent with the prediction of this model @xcite .",
    "nevertheless the energy range covered by the existing experimental data is not enough to distinguish between the ope prediction and the regge trajectory approach @xcite .",
    "the compass experiment at cern , uses the muon beam , can significantly enlarge the available energy range of virtual photons up to about 150 gev .",
    "compass has a good opportunity to contribute to the study of exotic charmonia via their photoproduction .",
    "however the uncertainties of the theoretical description of photon - nucleon interaction at high energies complicate this task . the process of @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a virtual photon , has quite good experimental signature and can be used as a benchmark .",
    "possibility to use @xmath6 photoproduction as a benchmark for study of exotic hadrons is discussed also in @xcite .",
    "it is also significant to carry out more theoretical studies on the @xmath1 process in order to clarify the role of the reggeized treatment .",
    "moreover , due to the vector meson dominance ( vmd ) assumption , a photon can interact with a vector meson , which means that the @xmath10 reaction can also  proceed through the vector meson dominance ( vmd ) mechanism @xcite .",
    "thus the @xmath11 photoproduction mechanism is also an interesting issue .    in this work",
    ", the @xmath1 reaction is investigated using an effective lagrangian approach and the regge model .",
    "in addition to the @xmath12 exchange , the contributions from the vmd mechanism is also considered .",
    "the differential cross section of the @xmath10 reaction is also calculated , which could be tested by further compass experiment .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "after the introduction , we present the formalism and the main ingredients which are used in our calculation .",
    "the numerical results and discussions are given in sec .",
    "iii . in sec .",
    "iv , we give a detailed illustration of the possibility of the experimental test at compass . finally , the paper ends with a brief summary .",
    "in the present work , an effective lagrangian approach in terms of hadrons is adopted , which is an important theoretical method in investigating various scattering processes @xcite .",

    "( b ) same as in ( a ) , but for the case in the frame of  the vmd model.,title=\"fig : \" ]    to gauge the contribution of this diagram , we need to know the relevant effective lagrangian densities .    for the @xmath14 interaction vertex",
    "we take the effective pseudoscalar coupling @xcite,@xmath15where @xmath16 is the pauli matrix , while @xmath17 and @xmath12 stand for the fields of the nucleon and the pion , respectively .",
    "the coupling constant of the @xmath14 interaction was given in many theoretical works , and we take @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the commonly employed lagrangian densities for @xmath19 and @xmath20 couplings are @xcite : @xmath21where @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the photon , @xmath11 meson , @xmath26 and @xmath12 fields .",

    "the lagrangian of depicting the coupling of the intermediate vector meson @xmath26 with a photon is written as @xmath41where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the mass and the decay constant of the @xmath26 meson , respectively . with the above equation",

    "it is obvious that there is a significant peak structure in the region of low @xmath93 , which increases rapidly near the threshold and then decreases slowly with increasing @xmath93 .",

    "the energy of a virtual photon covers the range from about 20 gev and up to 180 gev .",
    "the obtained data can be used to clarify the mechanism of the @xmath11 production and the role of the reggeized treatment at high energies . nevertheless , most of the @xmath111 mesons at such energies are produced non exclusively via the pomeron exchange mechanism .",
    "such events could produce strong background under poor exclusivity control .",
    "additional systematics could come from the process @xmath114 ( the cross section of this reaction is of the same order of magnitude @xcite ) because the compass setup is not able to reconstruct a decay of low - energy @xmath115 in a regular way .",
    "nuclear effects in @xmath11 photoproduction off the lithium-6 , deuterium and nitrogen nuclei should also be taken into account in an appropriate way .",
    "the forthcoming upgrade of the compass setup related to the planned data taking within the framework of the gpd program @xcite could provide better conditions for experimental study of the reaction @xmath8 and partially eliminate problems mentioned above .",
    "the new 2.5 m long liquid hydrogen target surrounded by a 4 m long recoil proton detector will be used .",
    "absence of the neutrons in the target will remove one exclusive production channel for @xmath116 .",
    "the recoil proton detector serves the double purpose : to reconstruct and identify recoil protons via time - of - flight and energy loss measurements .",
    "since the reaction @xmath8 does not have a recoil proton in the final state , any activity in the recoil proton detector could be used as the veto in the offline analysis .",
    "in addition , the recoil proton detector will be able to detect the @xmath117 decay .",
    "significant impact on the exclusivity control efficiency will be made by the planned upgrade of the electromagnetic calorimetry system .",
    "within the framework of the effective lagrangian approach and regge model , the @xmath0 photoproduction from the proton is investigated .",
    "the obtained numerical results indicate the following :    * the total cross section @xmath1 related to the experimental data @xcite is well reproduced with reasonable value of @xmath92 . although the monopole form factor was used in the calculations , the dipole and exponential form factors were also tested .",
