    "both planets are highly irradiated due to their close proximity to their host star .",
    "hd189733b forms a bow shock in the wind of its host star ( @xcite ) from which the planetary magnetic field strength can be derived .",
    "@xcite obtained hires observations in h@xmath0 which suggest a magnetic field strength of 28 g for the giant gas planet hd189733b .",
    "_ chandra _ observations ( 0.1 - 5 kev ) indicate a deeper x - ray transit than for optical wavelengths ( @xcite ) , but see @xcite for the effect of stellar variability .",
    "@xcite presented the first study of hd189733b mass loss based on hst transit observations , later confirmed in ( @xcite ) .",
    "harps observations of blue - shifted na d lines ( @xmath1 km s@xmath2 ) in the upper layers of the atmosphere above a cloud deck ( @xcite ) enabled the spatial resolution of an eastward wind on hd189733b ( @xcite ) indicating a globally circulating atmosphere ( @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of h@xmath3o is suggested by dayside emission spectrum ( @xcite ) , secondary eclipse emission spectrum ( @xcite ) , transit absorption spectrum ( @xcite ) and by ground - based high - resolution spectroscopy ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite find strong evidence for ch@xmath4 absorption in their nicmos transmission spectra and interpret this finding as a confirmation of earlier publications on the detection of ch@xmath4 in the atmosphere of hd189733b .",

    "@xcite could not confirm co@xmath3 nicmos secondary eclipse observation .",
    "the efforts of deriving observational constraints on the atmosphere chemistry are challenged by the repeated detection of a thick cloud layer on hd189733b through transit spectroscopy ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite were the first to use mgsio@xmath5[s ] as a possible abundant condensate with particle size @xmath6 m based on transit observations with acs on hubble .",
    "retrieval methods were applied to reflectance spectra to provide further insight in chemical composition of the atmosphere and cloud properties ( @xcite ) .    the first mass loss detection on hd209458b was made by @xcite and @xcite suggesting the escape of hi , oi and cii .",
    "@xcite report absorption in mgi in a region where atmospheric escape is suggested to take place .",
    "4.5@xmath7 m spitzer / irac data imply the presence of a hot spot shifted eastward by @xmath8 and a day - night - side temperature difference of @xmath9k ( @xcite ) .",
    "the analysis of spitzer / infrared array camera primary transit and secondary eclipse light curves ( @xcite ) did not confirm the detection of water in hd209458b , but suggest a depletion of atmospheric co and no thermal inversion layer to be detectable at spitzer wavelengths ( also @xcite ) .",
    "however , the hubble observation at 1.4@xmath7 m by @xcite provides evidence for h@xmath3o absorption in hd209458b which was confirmed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite observed the thermal dayside emission by high - resolution spectroscopy of the carbon monoxide band at 2.3 @xmath7 m .",
    "they do not find any emission signature required to confirm a thermal inversion in the atmosphere of hd209458b .",
    "@xcite suggest that their tio opacity data was insufficient to reach any conclusion regarding a thermal inversion on hd209458b .",
    "these conclusions , however , are based on the assumption that the featured molecules are associated with a thermal inversion and not with another process that affects , for example , their abundance .",
    "the presence of tio and vo is derived from stiss observation of hd209458b ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is suggested that tio and vo exist in two distinct layers including one at higher atmospheric layers above the @xmath10-level where potential condensates would be thermally stable with @xmath11 partial pressure of the gas species x , and @xmath12 is the saturation vapour pressure of the ( e.g. solid ) material s. ] .",
    "this conclusion about the presence of gaseous tio or vo , however , can only be correct if the layer above @xmath10 is warmer such that @xmath13 , i.e. in a case of an outward temperature increase .",
    "@xcite conclude that the detection of si@xmath14 indicates that clouds involving si do not form in the atmosphere of hd209458b .",
    "both planets have been compared regarding the interplay between the irradiation and the atmosphere dynamics and its effect on the molecular gas composition ( @xcite ) , regarding their mass loss ( @xcite ) , and their cloud - free dynamic atmosphere structure ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite suggests from his retrieval procedure that both planets , hd209458b and hd189733b host a thick cloud deck .",
    "our paper takes this approach further to present a comparative study of the cloud structures of hd209458b and hd189733b based on kinetic simulation of the non - equilibrium cloud forming processes in combination with results of 3d atmosphere structure simulations .",
    "we , however , note that our present approach is limited by the need to run the cloud - formation and 3d rhd simulations independently ."
