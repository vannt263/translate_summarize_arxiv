    "hence , using the second assertion of lemma [ lem - doubling ] , equation ( [ eq - disjoint ] ) provides the claim .",
    "now we address the transfer of the cohen - macaulay property under forming disjoint unions .",
    "[ cor - unions ] let @xmath25 and @xmath26 be two graphs such that that their cut varieties are arithmetically cohen - macaulay .",
    "then the cut variety associated to the disjoint union of @xmath25 and @xmath26 is arithmetically cohen - macaulay if and only if the two varieties defined by @xmath25 and @xmath26 are hilbertian .",
    "denote by @xmath261 , and @xmath262 the homogeneous coordinate rings of the cut varieties associated to @xmath263 , and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "proposition [ lem - doubling ] provides that @xmath148 is isomorphic to the segre product @xmath264 . if , say , @xmath25 does not have any edge , then @xmath265 is isomorphic to the a polynomial ring in one variable",
    ". thus it is hilbertian and @xmath148 is isomorphic to @xmath262 .",
    "if both graphs @xmath25 and @xmath26 have at least one edge , the krull dimension of @xmath265 and @xmath262 is at least two . then the claim is a consequence of lemma [ lem - segre - cm ] .",
    "recall that a _",
    "forest _ is a disjoint union of trees .",
    "thus we get :    [ cor - forest ] the cut variety defined by any forest is arithmetically gorenstein .",
    "this follows immediately by combining theorem [ thm - trees ] and proposition [ prop - disjoint ] .",
    "we are ready to analyze cut ideals of more complicated graphs using our results for cut ideals of trees and cycles . in order to describe the graphs , we need additional vocabulary .    a vertex @xmath266 of a graph @xmath0",
    "is called a _ cutvertex _ if the number of connected components of the vertex - induced subgraph on @xmath267 is larger than that of @xmath0 .",
    "similarly , an edge @xmath268 is called a _ bridge _ if the number of connected components of @xmath269 is larger than that of @xmath0 .",
    "block _ of @xmath0 is a maximal connected subgraph of @xmath0 without cut vertices .",
    "it follows that each block of a graph is either an isolated vertex , a bridge , or a maximal @xmath270-connected subgraph .",
    "a _ ring graph _ is a graph @xmath0 with the property that each block of @xmath0 which is not a bridge or a vertex can be constructed from a cycle by successively adding cycles of length at least @xmath81 using the edge - sum ( @xmath271-sum ) construction .",
    "gitler , reyes and villarreal study the family of graphs whose number of primitive cycles equals its cycle rank .",
    "they show that this family is precisely the family of ring graphs .",
    "ring graphs were first introduced in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they are a subclass of series - parallel graphs . for further background on series - parallel graphs",
    ", the reader should refer to @xcite .",
    "examples of ring graphs include trees and cycles .",
    "more precisely , ring graphs are those graphs that can be obtained from trees and cycles by performing clique sums over vertices or edges .",
    "they form a large subclass of series parallel graphs , since they are free of @xmath272-minors ( @xcite ) .    combining our results from the previous sections , we obtain the following more precise version of theorem [ thm - intro ] :    [ thm : main - tree+cycle ] if @xmath0 is a ring graph , then the cut variety @xmath3 is generated by quadrics . in addition",
    ", there exists a term order for which its defining ideal @xmath16 has a squarefree quadratic grbner basis .",
    "therefore , such varieties @xmath3 are hilbertian and arithmetically cohen - macaulay , but not arithmetically gorenstein in general .",
    "the theorem follows by applying proposition [ prop - cycle ] , theorem [ thm - trees ] , corollary [ cor - gr - disjoint - u ] , and theorem [ thm - lift - quad ] repeatedly .",
    "recall that if an ideal @xmath62 admits a quadratic grbner basis , then the coordinate ring @xmath64 is koszul ( see @xcite ) .",
    "thus , we get .",
    "[ cor : tree+cycle = koszul ] the coordinate ring of the cut variety associated to an arbitrary ring graph is koszul .",
    "theorem 1.3 of @xcite characterizes those graphs whose cut ideals have squarefree reverse - lexicographic initial ideals .",
    "arbitrary ring graphs _ do not _ fall into that category , however our result shows that they _ do _ have squarefree initial ideals with respect to another term order .",
    "we conclude this note with an estimate on the degrees of the higher syzygies of cut ideals .",
    "in general , the castelnuovo - mumford regularity of a homogeneous ideal can grow doubly exponentially in the number of variables .",
    "however , the following result shows that cut ideals of ring graphs have much better properties also in this respect .",
    "recall that the cut ideal of a graph with @xmath50 vertices lives in a polynomial ring in @xmath131 variables .",
    "[ cor - reg ] if @xmath0 is a ring graph with @xmath268 edges , then the castelnuovo - mumford regularity of the cut variety @xmath3 satisfies @xmath273    the least integer @xmath274 such that the hilbert function and the hilbert polynomial of a graded algebra in each degree @xmath275 is often called the index of regularity . by theorem [ thm : main - tree+cycle ] we know that the coordinate ring @xmath276 of any cut variety associated to a ring graph @xmath0 is hilbertian , i.e. , its index of regularity is at most zero .",
    "however , in case of cohen - macaulay rings the index of regularity and the castelnuovo - mumford regularity are related ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 8) ) .",
    "it follows that @xmath277 since the dimension of the ring @xmath276 is one plus the number of edges of @xmath0 , the argument is complete .",
    "[ rem - reg ] ( i ) note that by proposition [ prop - hilb - tree ] the above bound is almost sharp if the graph is a tree .",
    "\\(ii ) the above arguments use only the fact that cut ideals of ring graphs admit a squarefree grbner basis .",
    "thus , they provide the following observation :    if the cut ideal of a graph @xmath0 admits a squarefree grbner basis , then the castelnuovo - mumford regularity of the cut variety @xmath3 is bounded above by one plus the number of edges of @xmath0 .",
