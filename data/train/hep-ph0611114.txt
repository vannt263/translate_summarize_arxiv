    "da we use a qcd sum rule ( sr ) approach with non - local condensates ( nlc ) @xcite , employing for the scalar and vector condensates the same minimal model as in  @xcite @xmath10 the nonlocality parameter @xmath11 characterizes the average momentum of quarks in the qcd vacuum and has been estimated in qcd srs  @xcite and on the lattice  @xcite : @xmath12 .",
    "for the quark - gluon - antiquark condensates we use @xmath13 with ( @xmath14 ) @xmath15 the minimal model of nonlocal qcd vacuum suggests the following ansatze @xmath16 with @xmath17 and faces problems with qcd equations of motion and gauge invariance of 2-point correlator of vector currents . in order to fulfil qcd equations of motion exactly and minimize non - transversity of @xmath18 correlator we suggest the improved model of qcd vacuum with @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath17 and    @xmath21      then the nlc sum rules for the pion da produce  @xcite a `` _ _ bunch _ _ '' of 2-parameter models at @xmath23 gev@xmath24 ( with @xmath25 ) @xmath26\\,,\\ ] ] shown in fig .",

    "we emphasize here that bms model  @xcite , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pion.da.bunch]b by symbol , is inside the allowed region dictated by the improved qcd vacuum model .",

    "[ fig : pion.da.bunch]a that in comparison with cz model  @xcite ( dashed red line , @xmath33 and @xmath34 at @xmath35  gev@xmath24 ) nlc - dictated models are much more end - point suppressed , although are double - humped .",
    "the cleo experimental data  @xcite on @xmath0 allow one to obtain direct constraints on @xmath36 . applying the lcsr approach  @xcite",
    ", one can effectively account for the long - distance effects of a real photon by using quark - hadron duality in the vector channel and a dispersion relation in @xmath37 .    in our cleo data analysis @xcite",
    ", we also used the relation between @xmath38 and the twist-4 magnitude @xmath39 and estimated @xmath40 at @xmath41 gev@xmath24 .",
    "we used , following the approach of  @xcite , the asymptotic model for the twist-4 contribution .",
    "we found that even with a 20% uncertainty in @xmath42 , the chernyak ",
    "zhitnitsky ( cz ) da @xcite was excluded _ at least _ at the * @xmath43 * -level , whereas the asymptotic da was off the * @xmath44 * -level , while the bms `` bunch '' was inside the @xmath45-region  @xcite , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bms - lattice ] as a solid ovals around the best - fit point ( ) .",
    "another possibility , suggested in  @xcite , to obtain constraints on the pion da in the lcsr analysis of the cleo data  to use for the twist-4 contribution renormalon - based model , relating it then to parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 of the pion da . using this method we obtain  @xcite the renormalon - based constraints for the parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 , shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : bms - lattice],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    it is remarkable that these lattice results are in striking agreement with the previous  @xcite and improved  @xcite estimates of @xmath27 both from nlc qcd srs and also from the cleo - data analyses  based on lcsr@xcite , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : bms - lattice ] , where the lattice results of  @xcite are shown in the form of a vertical strip , containing the central value with associated errors .",
    "noteworthily , the value of @xmath27 of the displayed lattice measurements ( middle line of the strip ) is very close to the cleo best fit in  @xcite ( ) , whereas almost all the bunch , dictated by the improved nlc qcd srs  @xcite , is inside the strip .",
    "moreover , this bunch is completely inside the standard cleo @xmath45-ellipse and partially inside the renormalon - based cleo @xmath45-ellipse .",
    "so , we can conclude that the two - humped and endpoint - suppressed profile of the pion da emerging from the cleo - data analysis is consistent with that we have determined independently from qcd sum rules with nonlocal condensates  @xcite .",
    "the improvement of the nlc model , suggested in  @xcite , shifts the allowed region and puts it just in the intersection of the cleo - data @xmath45-regions , obtained using the asymptotic and the renormalon - based models for twist-4 contribution .",
