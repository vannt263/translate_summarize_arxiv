    "efforts to implement quantum computation have recently intensified .",
    "the application of the quantum bit ( qubit ) to solid - state materials , such as superconducting josephson junctions @xcite and quantum dots @xcite , is particularly promising , because these implementations have the advantage of scalability . in a coupled - dot system , for example ,",
    "the localized states in the left and right dots are treated as a basic two - level system , in which the tunnel coupling between the two dots constructs a quantum superposition of the dots .",
    "this superposition manifests itself in coherent quantum oscillation ( rabi oscillation ) , and transition can be induced between the superposed states @xcite . a nanometer - scale superconducting electrode connected to a reservoir via",
    "a josephson junction constitutes an artificial two - level system in which the charge states , coupled by tunneling , differ by @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the electronic charge .",
    "this system has shown clear rabi oscillation @xcite .",
    "quantum coherence must be maintained during quantum gate operation .",
    "dephasing , characterized by the dephasing time , originates from various couplings between the qubit and the environment .",
    "when the qubit is implemented in a solid - state system , the effects of phonons and electromagnetic and background charge fluctuations ( bcfs ) are important in the dephsing process .",
    "the effect of phonons has been examined in semiconductor quantum dots as the source of the dephasing accompanying dissipation @xcite ; the effect of electromagnetic fluctuation in josephson junction qubits has been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "however , bcfs have not yet been examined systematically , in spite of their importance in the dephasing process .",
    "bcfs have been observed in many systems @xcite . in nanoscale systems , they are the electrostatic potential fluctuations due to the dynamics of electrons or holes trapped at impurity sites . in particular , the charge of a single impurity fluctuates with the lorentzian spectrum form , which is called `` random telegraph noise '' in the time domain @xcite .",
    "the random distribution of the positions of such impurities and their time constants lead to bcfs or 1/f noise @xcite . in solid - state charge qubits , these bcfs lead to a dynamical electrostatic disturbance and hence the dephasing .",
    "the effect of 1/f noise on a charge josephson qubit has been examined theoretically - the interaction between the qubit and environment has been treated by the perturbation method @xcite , by gaussian approximation @xcite and by the path integral method within a spin - boson model @xcite .",
    "when fluctuating impurities exist in the substrate , not in the junction @xcite , the coupling between the qubit and bcfs is weak , and the perturbation method is sufficient .",
    "however , when the interaction between the qubit and environment is strong , methods that go beyond perturbation are needed .    in this study , we investigated how the electrostatic disturbance of time constant @xmath2 coming from a single impurity affects the quantum coherence of a qubit irrespective of the strength of the qubit - impurity coupling .",
    "we also examine the effect of many impurity sites .",
    "this approach is in clear contrast with previous ones @xcite , in which the phenomenological spectral weight of the boson thermal bath was used to characterize the effect of bcfs .",
    "we consider two types of couplings between the qubit and the environment : pure dephasing and dephasing accompanied with relaxation of the population @xcite . in symmetrical coupled - dot systems ,",
    "the former corresponds to a fluctuation in the tunnel coupling constant , and the latter to that in the asymmetric bias @xcite .",
    "the mapping from a coupled - dot system to the josephson charge qubit is discussed in sec .",
    "vi . by using the method of stochastic differential equations ,",
    "we obtain analytically the dephasing rate , which is shown to be always smaller than @xmath3 .",
    "it should be noted that this dephasing process does not mean the qubit becomes entangled with the environment , but rather it means the stochastical evolution of an external classical field , suppressing the off - diagonal density matrix elements of the qubit after being averaged over statistically distributed samples .",

    "section iii explains the method of stochastic differential equations .",
    "the fluctuations in tunnel coupling and asymmetric bias are examined in secs .",

    "section vii summarizes the paper .",
    "the qubit and the effect of a single impurity are examined in terms of the following hamiltonian : @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the creation and annihilation operators of the left and the right dots , assuming a single level for each dot , as shown in fig .",
    "the @xmath7 is the tunnel coupling between the dots , and @xmath8 is the asymmetric bias between them .",
    "the interaction between a qubit and the charge at the impurity site is described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the magnitude of the fluctuation in the tunnel coupling , @xmath11 is the magnitude of the fluctuation in the asymmetrical bias , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the creation and annihilation operators of the charge at the impurity site , respectively .",
    "we assume that the time evolution of statistical variable @xmath14 is a poisson process . assuming a strong coupling between the charge at the impurity site and the nearby electron reservoir , the dynamics of the charge induces not gaussian white noise , but random telegraph noise @xcite .",
    "we therefore consider the effect of random telegraph noise with characteristic time constant @xmath2 , where the statistical variable @xmath15 takes the value 1 or -1 ( fig .",
    "1(b ) ) .    the time constant is determined by the barrier height of the electron or hole trap and the temperature , like @xmath16 , where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 are the activation energy of the impurity potential , boltzmann s constant , the temperature , and the temperature - independent prefactor , respectively @xcite .",
    "when the temperature decreases , @xmath2 becomes longer .",
    "the telegraph noise has been experimentally observed to take a value of 1 or -1 with asymmetric probabilities , which arises from the difference between the fermi energy of the electron reservoir and the energy level of the impurity sites .",
    "@xcite . to include this asymmetric weight , we introduce asymmetric probabilities @xmath21 and @xmath22 , which relate the asymmetric transition rates for the process from -1 to 1 ( @xmath23 ) to those of the opposite process ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "we neglect the backaction from the qubit to the charge at the impurity site , so this environment reduces to a classical stochastic external field .",
    "we also assume that the temperature is high enough for the effect of the quantum fluctuation of the charge between the impurity site and electron reservoir to be neglected .    for compactness , we rewrite the hamiltonian in terms of the pauli matrices while rotating basis @xmath25 from the basis of localized states in the left and right dots to bonding - antibonding basis : @xmath26 in the following , we consider only the case of a symmetrical coupled - dot system , @xmath27 , in which the effect of the bias fluctuation due to the dephasing starts only from the second order , @xmath28 , as shown in the following , and is less effective in the perturbation regime . as reduced hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eqn : hm ] ) suggests , the present results can also be applied to other quantum two - level systems in which telegraph - type fluctuation exists ( see sec .",
    "we are interested in the time - evolution of the qubit s two - by - two density matrix , @xmath29 , with an arbitrary initial condition at @xmath30 , @xmath31 . if bcf is absent , starting with the initial condition that the left dot is occupied , for example , the density matrix at @xmath30 is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the matrix of rotation from the localized basis to the bonding - antibonding basis . at time t , @xmath34 where the bases of the inner matrix are the left and right occupancy states .",

    "when @xmath163 , the rates decrease with an increasing @xmath2 .",
    "the shape of the dephasing rate as a function of @xmath164 is explained as follows .",
    "when @xmath165 , many dephasing events occur during one rabi oscillation cycle , each event leads to collective disturbance . because the long time constant of telegraph noise leads to large fluctuations in the variance of the rotating angle in the bloch sphere during rabi oscillation , the dephasing time decreases with an increasing @xmath2 .",
    "when @xmath163 , rabi oscillation occurs over more than one cycle in time @xmath2 and , in this regime , each dephasing event is independent .",
    "hence , the dephasing time increases with @xmath2 .",
    "the maximum around @xmath166 is a kind of resonance .",
    "we considered the effect of electrostatic disturbance due to background charge fluctuations ( bcfs ) . to summarize our findings , for pure dephasing ( @xmath167 ) , @xmath168 and @xmath169 . for dephasing with relaxation of the population ( @xmath170 ) , @xmath171 .",
    "next , we discuss the relationship between the experimentally observed @xmath73 and our results . in the present study ,",
    "the dephasing time with a single background charge was found to be longer than the time constant of the telegraph noise for both tunneling and bias fluctuations .",
    "the observed time constant of a dominant random telegraph noise is about 30 @xmath172 or longer @xcite , so a rather long dephasing time is expected .",
    "however , in another experiment , the dephasing time was about 1 ns @xcite .",
    "therefore , a single telegraph noise source may not be enough to explain the experimental results ; we should thus consider the effect of many impurity sites or other additional effects .",
    "we consider the effect of many impurities for the case in which there is no correlation between background charges .",
    "flucuation in the tunnel coupling arises from the modulation of the wave function in the coupled dots .",
    "the gradient of the electrostatic potential around the tunneling barrier , which comes from an electron or hole located at an impurity site , leads to a change in the tunnel coupling as well as a change in the asymmetric bias @xcite . for a charge state that couples with a coupled - dot system symmetrically",
    ", the pure dephasing event is critical . for dephasing accompanied with relaxation of the population , the unitary operators of each impurity , which lead to dephasing of the qubit , are not commuting .",
    "however , by neglecting the higher order @xmath173 s in the dephasing rate , we can take the ensemble sum of the effect of each charge state .",
    "in such a weak coupling case , @xmath174 , we can use eq .",
    "( [ eqn : t2bl ] ) , and the simple summation of the dephasing rate is expressed by @xcite @xmath175 where @xmath176 is the distribution width of the thermal activation energy of the charge states , @xmath177 is the distribution function of @xmath11 , which depends on the relative position between the qubit and impurity site , and @xmath178 is the sum over the random impurities . in the second equation , we assume uniform distribution of the activation energies of the background charges , @xmath179 ; for typical cases , @xmath180 is approximately 23 @xcite .",
    "use of the perturbation method showed that the dephasing rate of a josephson charge qubit in terms of @xmath173 is proportional to the inverse of @xmath181 in the limit of @xmath182 @xcite , where @xmath181 and @xmath183 are the josephson coupling constant and charging energy , respectively .",
    "this is similar to the estimate of @xmath184 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : t2 t ] ) , where @xmath185 corresponds to @xmath7 . with a larger @xmath7 and lower temperature ,",
    "the dephasing rate is lower .",
    "we next estimate the magnitude of the fluctuations , @xmath11 .",
    "the asymmetric bias fluctuation comes from asymmetric coupling between the two dots and the background charge , which is in the form of a dipole interaction , @xmath186 for @xmath187 , where @xmath13 is the distance between the two dots , @xmath188 is the distance between the coupled - dot system and the background charge , and @xmath189 is the angle between them @xcite .",
    "therefore , for a smaller qubit or a charge located far from the qubit , the effect of bias fluctuation should be less important .",
    "the dephasing rate is proportional to @xmath190 , which is estimated as @xmath191 for the impurity sites where the dipole approximation is appropriate , where @xmath192 is the radius beyond which the dipole approximation is valid , which depends on @xmath13 , @xmath193 is the density of impurity sites , and @xmath194 is the relative dielectric constant .",
    "therefore , the total dephasing time is well defined .",
    "the quality factor of a quantum logic gate is defined by the ratio of @xmath7 to @xmath184 : @xmath195 which represents how many gate operations can be done before the quantum coherence vanishes . from eq .",

    "the lower bound of the necessary gate quality factor was roughly estimated as @xmath203 @xcite .",
    "thus , density of charge states should be less than @xmath204 for fabrication .",
    "if there is a correlation between impurities ( a screening effect ) , dephasing will be suppressed in general @xcite .",

    "<S> the dephasing rate was inversely proportional to the time constant of the telegraph noise . </S>",
    "<S> when there is fluctuation in the tunnel coupling constant , gaussian decay occurs in the initial regime . </S>",
    "<S> we also examined the rate of dephasing due to many impurity sites . for a weak coupling condition with fluctuation in the asymmetric bias , the obtained dephasing rate coincided with that obtained by the perturbation method using the spectral weight of a boson thermal bath , which is proportional to the inverse of the frequency .    2 </S>"
