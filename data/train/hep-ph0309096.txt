    "the transverse momentum of the incoming partons is neglected and so , for the born level subprocesses @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 ) or @xmath10 , the transverse momentum of the final electroweak boson is zero .",
    "therefore , initial - state qcd radiation is necessary to generate the @xmath1 distributions . both the leading order ( lo ) and next - to - leading order ( nlo ) differential cross sections diverge for @xmath11 , with terms proportional to @xmath12 appearing due to soft and collinear gluon emission , requiring resummation to achieve a finite @xmath1 distribution .",
    "traditional calculations combine fixed - order perturbation theory at high @xmath1 with either analytic resummation or numerical parton shower formalisms at low @xmath1 , with some matching criterion to decide when to switch between the two . in addition",
    ", a parameterisation is needed to account for non - perturbative effects at the lowest @xmath1 values .",
    "analytic resummation can be performed either in the transverse momentum space ( see , for example , @xcite ) or in the fourier conjugate impact parameter space ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "an alternate description is provided in terms of _ unintegrated _ parton distribution functions ( updfs ) , where each incoming parton carries its own transverse momentum @xmath13 , so that the subprocesses @xmath8 and @xmath10 already generate the lo @xmath1 distributions in the so - called @xmath13-factorisation approach .- factorisation , see @xcite . ]",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that updfs obtained from an approximate solution of the ccfm evolution equation @xcite embody the conventional soft gluon resummation formulae .",
    "the updfs that we use are obtained from the familiar dglap - evolved pdfs determined from a global parton analysis of deep - inelastic and related hard - scattering data .",
    "the transverse momentum of the parton is generated entirely in the _ last _ evolution step @xcite .",
    "angular - ordering constraints are imposed which regulate the singularities arising from soft gluon emission , while the virtual terms in the dglap equation are resummed into sudakov form factors .",

    "doubly_-unintegrated parton distribution functions ( dupdfs ) in order to preserve the exact kinematics .",
    "it was demonstrated that the main features of conventional higher order calculations can be accounted for within a much simpler theoretical framework , named @xmath0-factorisation .",
    "is the splitting fraction associated with the last evolution step , where a parton with ( light - cone ) momentum fraction @xmath14 splits to a final parton with ( light - cone ) momentum fraction @xmath15 .",
    "the idea is an extension of the original ddt formula @xcite ; however , in comparison with @xcite we go beyond the double leading logarithmic approximation ( dlla ) and account for the precise kinematics of the two incoming partons , as well as the angular ordering of emitted gluons . ]    strictly speaking , the integrated pdfs used as input to the last evolution step should themselves be determined from a new global fit to data using the @xmath0-factorisation approach . for the present paper ,",
    "we take the input pdfs from a global fit to data using the conventional collinear approximation @xcite .",
    "this treatment is adequate for these initial investigations .",
    "however , we expect it to lower our predictions for quark - initiated processes by @xmath1610% compared to the case where the input pdfs are determined from a global fit using the @xmath0-factorisation approach .",
    "we will illustrate this point in section 5 by comparing predictions for the proton structure function @xmath17 in the collinear approximation and in the @xmath0-factorisation formalism .",
    "the ` last - step ' prescription has some features in common with the initial - state parton shower algorithms implemented in monte carlo event generators ( for a recent review , see @xcite ) such as the dglap - based herwig @xcite and pythia @xcite programs and the ccfm - based cascade @xcite program .",
    "the main advantage of our approach is that we use simple analytic formulae which implement the crucial physics in a transparent way , without the additional details or tuning which are frequently introduced in monte carlo programs .",
    "the @xmath1 distributions are generated entirely from known and universal dupdfs .",
    "for example , fits to @xmath3 production data at the tevatron using parton showers favour a large intrinsic partonic transverse momentum @xmath18 gev , while confinement of partons inside the proton would imply a @xmath19 gev @xcite .",
    "the dglap - based parton showers used in @xcite are theoretically justified only in the limit of strongly - ordered transverse momentum , since only the collinear divergent part of the squared matrix element is kept in each parton branching .",
    "similarly , the ccfm - based parton shower used in @xcite is strictly justified only in the limit of strongly - ordered angles , which reduces to the limit of strongly - ordered transverse momentum as long as @xmath15 is not too small . in this limit ,",
    "the transverse momentum generated in all evolution steps prior to the last is negligible .",
    "therefore , neglecting transverse momentum in every evolution step prior to the last should be a good approximation to the parton shower algorithms in which finite transverse momentum is generated at _ every _ evolution step .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to demonstrate that the @xmath1 distributions of electroweak bosons can be successfully generated by dupdfs .",
    "we do not aim to produce a _",
    "better _ description of the data than existing calculations , but rather a _",
    "simpler _ analytic description which reproduces the main features . with this approach ,",
    "it is easy to see the physical origin of the @xmath1 distributions and to identify the most important feynman diagrams .",
    "since the dupdfs are universal  that is , they apply equally well to all hard hadronic processes  it is important to check them in a new kinematic domain .",

    "we have extended the method of @xmath0-factorisation using doubly - unintegrated parton distributions @xcite to hadron - hadron collisions .",
    "the key idea is that the incoming partons to the subprocess have finite transverse momenta , which can be observed in the particles produced in the final state .",
    "this transverse momentum is generated perturbatively in the last evolution step , with a suitable extrapolation for the non - perturbative contribution .",
    "virtual terms in the dglap equation are resummed into sudakov form factors and angular - ordering constraints are applied which regulate soft gluon emission . by accounting for the precise kinematics in the subprocess , together with these sudakov form factors and angular - ordering constraints , we are able to include the main part of conventional higher order calculations .",
    "we used this framework to calculate the @xmath1 distributions of @xmath2 and @xmath3 bosons produced at the tevatron run 1 .",
    "the predictions gave a very good description of cdf and d data over the whole @xmath1 range , after multiplying by an overall factor of 1.11.2 , corresponding to multiplying each dupdf by a factor @xmath189 .",
    "we explained the origin of the need for this extra factor , which should not be regarded as a deficiency of our approach , but rather reflects the fact that the input integrated pdfs should themselves be determined from data using @xmath0-factorisation .",
    "we also used the framework to calculate the @xmath1 distribution for sm higgs bosons of mass 125 gev produced at the lhc . for @xmath187 ,",
    "our simple prescription was found to reproduce , to a fair degree , the predictions of more elaborate theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "adm thanks the leverhulme trust for an emeritus fellowship .",
