    "in braneworld cosmologies , the ordinary matter is on a three dimensional space ( the brane ) which is embedded in a larger space ( the bulk ) where only gravity can propagate .",
    "these models , which have received great attention in recent years @xcite , were proposed to solve the hierarchy problem ( the difficulty in explaining why the gravity scale is sixteen orders of magnitude greater than the electro - weak scale ) and they have motivation in recent developments of string theory , known as m - theory .",
    "the presence of the extra dimensions would modify the properties of black holes @xcite .",
    "clancy et al .",
    "@xcite showed that , in the simplest of braneworld scenarios , the randall - sundrum @xcite models ( a positive tension brane in a bulk with one extra dimension and a negative cosmological constant ) primordial black holes formed in the high energy epoch would have a longer lifetime , because of a different evaporation law . braneworld primordial black holes could have a growth of their mass through accretion of surrounding radiation during the high energy phase , increasing their lifetime @xcite .",
    "these black holes could have survived up to the present and they have an induced four dimensional metric on the brane different from the schwarzschild metric . in these models , black holes also may be created in high energy collisions in particle accelerators or in cosmic rays @xcite . in the randall - sundrum scenario ,",
    "dadhich et al . found a spherically symmetric black hole solution on a three dimensional brane @xcite , which is characterized by a tidal charge , due to gravitational effects coming from the fifth dimension .",
    "recently , rotating black hole solutions with a tidal charge were studied by aliev et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the study of the null geodesics around black holes , in which photons coming from astrophysical sources move , is useful to obtain information about these objects .",
    "gravitational lensing by black holes has been investigated by several authors in the last decade , mainly because of the strong evidence about the presence of supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies .",
    "a useful approximate analytical method for obtaining the positions , magnifications , and time delays of the relativistic images corresponding to black hole lenses , is the strong deflection limit .",
    "it was introduced by darwin @xcite for the schwarzschild geometry , rediscovered several times @xcite , extended to the reissner - nordstrm spacetime @xcite , and to any spherically symmetric black holes @xcite .",
    "numerical studies @xcite of black hole lenses were performed too .",
    "non - rotating braneworld black holes were studied as gravitational lenses @xcite as well .",
    "kerr black hole lenses were considered by several authors @xcite .",
    "rotating black holes present apparent shapes or shadows with an optical deformation due to the spin @xcite , instead of being circles as in the case of non - rotating ones .",
    "this topic has been reexamined by several authors in the last few years @xcite , with the expectation that the direct observation of black holes will be possible in the near future @xcite ; therefore the study of the shadows will be useful for measuring the properties of astrophysical black holes .",
    "optical properties of rotating braneworld black holes were studied by schee and stuchlik @xcite . for more details about black hole gravitational lensing and a discussion of its observational prospects ,",
    "see the recent review article @xcite and the references therein .    in this paper , we study how the presence of the tidal charge modifies the form of the shadow cast by the spinning black hole with a tidal charge introduced by aliev et al .",
    "@xcite , in the randall - sundrum braneworld scenario .",
    "this topic has been previously considered by schee and stuchlik @xcite ; in our work we calculate the observables defined by hioki and maeda @xcite and we concentrate on the analysis of the shadow corresponding to the galactic black hole .",
    "when the appropriate combination of the rotation parameter and the tidal charge is large enough , the event horizon disappears and a naked singularity is obtained .",
    "this case , not analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite , is considered here . in sec .",
    "2 , we review the basic aspects of the geometry and the geodesics of the rotating braneworld black hole . in sec . 3",
    ", we obtain the shadows of black holes with different values of the rotation parameter and the tidal charge . in sec . 4 ,",
    "the study is extended to naked singularities . finally , in sec . 5",
    ", we discuss the results found .",
    "we adopt units such that @xmath0 .",
    "we adopt for the rotating black hole in the randall - sundrum braneworld scenario the metric introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , which in the boyer - lindquist coordinates has the form @xmath1 ^ 2 , \\label{metric}\\ ] ] with @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the mass , @xmath4 is the rotation parameter ( angular momentum per unit mass , @xmath5 ) , and @xmath6 is the tidal charge of the black hole .",
    "this metric was obtained by adopting the assumption that the induced geometry on the 3d brane has the kerr - schild form @xcite .",
    "it is unclear if this choice of the metric on the brane is indeed fulfilled by an exact bulk metric @xcite .",
    "the tidal charge is interpreted as an imprint of the gravitational effects from the bulk space @xcite .",
    "we let the tidal charge take any sign , but some authors argue that the negative sign is more natural ( see @xcite and references therein ) . when @xmath7 one recovers the kerr geometry .",
    "the non - rotating case , i.e. @xmath8 , corresponds to the brane black hole metric previously studied in ref .",
    "the properties of the geometry ( [ metric ] ) are similar to those of the kerr - newman metric in general relativity .",
    "the event horizon is determined by largest root of the equation @xmath9 , given by @xmath10 thus , the event horizon exists if @xmath11 , with the equal sign corresponding to a maximally rotating black hole ( with @xmath12 ) .",
    "when the tidal charge is positive , this condition leads to the kerr type bound on the angular momentum , i.e. the rotation parameter can not exceed the mass .",
    "but the situation is different for the negative tidal charge , for which the maximally rotating black hole has the rotation parameter greater than the mass . in what follows , for simplicity , we adimensionalize all quantities with the mass of the black hole , which is equivalent to put @xmath13 in all equations . +",
    "when a black hole is between a source of light and an observer , the light reaches the observer after being deflected by the black hole gravitational field ; but some part of the photons emitted by the source , those with small impact parameters , end up falling into the black hole , not reaching the observer , giving as result a dark zone in the sky called the shadow .",
    "the apparent shape of a black hole is thus defined by the boundary of the shadow . in order to obtain the apparent shape",
    ", we need to study the geodesic structure .",
    "the hamilton - jacobi equation determines the geodesics for a given geometry : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is an affine parameter along the geodesics , @xmath16 are the components of the metric tensor and @xmath17 is the jacobi action .",
    "when the problem is _ separable _ , the jacobi action @xmath17 can be written in the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the mass of a test particle .",
    "the second term on the right hand side is related to the conservation of energy @xmath20 , while the third term is related to the conservation of the angular momentum in the direction of the axis of symmetry @xmath21 . in the case of null geodesics",

    "these equations determine the propagation of light in the spacetime of the braneworld rotating black hole .",
    "the geometry ( [ metric ] ) is asymptotically flat , so the trajectory of photons are straight lines at infinity .",
    "the light rays are , in general , characterized by two impact parameters , which can be expressed in terms of the constants of motion @xmath20 , @xmath21 and the carter constant @xmath32 . combining these quantities we define as usual @xmath33 and @xmath34 , which are the impact parameters for general orbits around the black hole .",
    "we use eq .",
    "( [ er ] ) to derive the orbits with constant @xmath35 in order to obtain the boundary of the shadow of the black hole .",
    "these orbits satisfy the conditions @xmath36 , which are fulfilled by the values of the impact parameters that determine the contour of the shadow , namely , @xmath37 } { a(1-r)}=\\xi_\\text{k}(r)-\\frac{2 q r}{a(r-1 ) } , \\label{eqxi}\\ ] ] @xmath38 ^{2}\\right\\ } } { a^{2}(r-1)^{2}}=\\eta_\\text{k}(r)-\\frac{4 q r^{2}(\\delta - r)}{a^{2}(r-1)^{2 } } , \\label{eqeta}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 @xmath40 } { a^{2}(r-1)^{2}}\\ ] ] ( with @xmath41 ) are the corresponding values in kerr geometry .",
    "to describe the shadow , we adopt the celestial coordinates ( see for example @xcite ) : @xmath42 and @xmath43 where @xmath44 goes to infinity because we consider an observer far away from the black hole , and @xmath45 is the angular coordinate of the observer , i.e. the inclination angle between the rotation axis of the black hole and the line of sight of the observer .",
    "the coordinates @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the apparent perpendicular distances of the image as seen from the axis of symmetry and from its projection on the equatorial plane , respectively .",

    "the observable @xmath111 is determined by the angle subtended by the arc , seen from the center of the circumference used to define @xmath110 . as in the black hole case ,",
    "when the inclination angle is known , if @xmath110 and @xmath111 are obtained from observations , the associated contour curves of constant @xmath110 and @xmath111 in the plane @xmath71 can be used to obtain the corresponding values of the rotation parameter @xmath68 and the tidal charge @xmath69 .",
    "for the reasons stated in the previous section , the more interesting case to analyze is the one corresponding to an observer in the equatorial plane . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we show the shadows of naked singularities situated at the origin of coordinates with inclination angle @xmath100 , for rotation parameters @xmath8 ( upper row , left ) , @xmath77 ( upper row , right ) , @xmath78 ( lower row , left ) , and @xmath79 ( lower row , right ) , for several values of the tidal charge @xmath69 , larger than the corresponding critical value @xmath87 .",
    "when @xmath8 we see that the shadow is a circumference with a radius that decreases with the tidal charge and a central dark point .",
    "if @xmath115 , we have that the shadow consists of a dark arc plus a line which finishes in the dark point in the figures .",
    "the arc closes when the tidal charge is near to @xmath121 and opens up as the charge increases .    in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , the observable @xmath122 is shown as a function of the tidal charge @xmath69 , for several values of the rotation parameter of the naked singularity : @xmath77 ( dashed line ) , @xmath78 ( dashed - dotted line ) , and @xmath79 ( dotted line ) .",
    "the behavior of @xmath122 is similar for the three values of @xmath68 , having a small growth for values of @xmath69 near @xmath87 , and then a decrease .",
    "the initial growth is related to the particular shape of the shadow generated by the rotation , and the definition of the circumference of reference .",
    "on the other hand , the decrease continues until the arc generated by the photons belonging to the photon sphere turns to a single point and then disappears indicating the loss of the photon sphere .",
    "as expected , the radius is also an increasing function of the rotation parameter @xmath68 which can be deduced from the position of the curves for different values of @xmath68 in the figure .",
    "the angle subtended by the end points of the shadow , measured from the center of the circumference of reference is a decreasing function of @xmath69 . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , the plot of the angle @xmath123 as a function of @xmath69 can be seen for @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the limiting values are @xmath124 and @xmath125 , corresponding to the critical value of the charge for which the singularity is covered by the horizon , and to the disappearance of the photon sphere , respectively . for @xmath126",
    "the angle is a decreasing function of the rotation parameter , while for @xmath127 the behavior is the opposite .",
    "the values of the rotation parameter @xmath68 and the tidal charge @xmath69 can be obtained from the intersection point of the curves with constant @xmath110 and @xmath111 in the plane @xmath71 ; to exemplify this , some representative contour curves are displayed in fig .",
    "in this article , we have extended previous studies @xcite of gravitational effects corresponding to rotating black holes in randall - sundrum braneworld cosmology .",
    "in particular , we have analyzed how the shadow of the black hole is distorted by the presence of the tidal charge . from the observable @xmath60",
    ", we have found that the size of the shadow for a fixed value of the rotation parameter @xmath68 decreases with the tidal charge @xmath69 , resulting in a larger shadow than in kerr geometry for negative @xmath69 and a smaller shadow for positive @xmath69 .",
    "the deformation of the shadow , characterized by the observable @xmath70 , increases with @xmath69 , so a less distorted silhouette is obtained for negative @xmath69 and a more deformed one for positive @xmath69 .    the angular size of the shadow can be estimated by using the observable @xmath58 to obtain the angular radius @xmath128 , with @xmath129 the distance from the observer to the black hole .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath130 @xmath131 .",
    "the observable @xmath70 ( % ) gives an idea of how the silhouette is deformed with respect to the non - rotating case .",
    "for the supermassive black hole sgr a * at the galactic center , we have @xmath132 and @xmath133 kpc @xcite ; then , under the assumption that the observer is in the equatorial plane , we obtain       where the values of @xmath68 and @xmath69 were chosen only for illustrative purposes .",
    "we see from the table that resolutions of less than @xmath134 are needed in order to extract useful information from future observations of the shadow of the galactic supermassive black hole .",
    "we have also studied the shadows of naked singularities , corresponding to the condition @xmath135 , for which the horizons associated to the braneworld metric considered in this paper fade out . for a rotating naked singularity , in the case that this kind of object exists in nature , the shadow has two parts : the arc and the dark spot or the straight line .",
    "the more interesting shape is the arc , which may not be observable because it is one - dimensional .",
    "in a realistic scenario , however , the neighborhood of the arc will also be darkened to be observed as a dark _ lunate _ ( i.e. crescent moon shaped ) shadow , as it was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite for the kerr metric .",
    "then , we would have a chance to observe the shadow of a naked singularity , but it will be even more difficult than in the case of black holes . for a given value of the rotation parameter @xmath68 ,",
    "the size of the arc is slightly smaller than the size of the distorted dark disk corresponding to a tidal charge satisfying @xmath136 , for which the horizon is present .",
    "the observation of black hole ( or naked singularity ) apparent shapes is a major goal in observational astrophysics , since those shadows correspond to a full description of the near horizon region , without any theoretical assumption concerning the underlying theory or astrophysical processes in the black hole surroundings . in the near future , some observational facilities ,",
    "most of them space - based , will be fully operational and will be able to measure in the radio and x bands .",
    "two of them are worth mentioning , namely , radioastron and maxim .",
    "the first one is a space - based radio telescope launched in july 2011",
    ". it will be capable of carrying out measurements with high angular resolution , about @xmath137 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the maxim project is a space - based x - ray interferometer with an expected angular resolution of about @xmath138 ( see @xcite for further details ) .",
    "these instruments will be able to resolve the shadow of the supermassive galactic black hole , which together with other observations , would serve to obtain its parameters in the near future .",
    "it seems that more subtle effects , like the comparison of different models of black holes corresponding to alternative theories , will require a second generation of instruments to be available in the future .",
    "if the braneworld model provides a suitable description of cosmology , one would expect a small ( and negative , as stated above ) value of the tidal charge , so a very large resolution will be necessary for the observation of the effects discussed in this work .",
