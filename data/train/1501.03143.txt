    "bosons in a regular optical lattice , which can be described by the bh model , show a transition from an incompressible , non - coherent mott insulator ( mi ) phase to a compressible , coherent superfluid ( sf ) phase , which has been shown experimentally @xcite as well as theoretically @xcite . in the disordered case the bose - glass ( bg ) phase occurs between the mi and the sf , which is compressible , but not coherent and",

    "based on the mean - field approximation @xcite various numerical techniques , such as local mean - field ( lmf ) theory @xcite , stochastic mean - field theory @xcite , and lmf cluster analysis @xcite have been proposed .",
    "the phase diagram of the 2d disordered bh model with random on - site potentials predicted by the lmf cluster analysis @xcite , which interprets the bg - sf transition as a percolation of sf regions , agrees very well with the one obtained from qmc methods @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite apply the percolation criterion for their studies on the bh model with random impurities .",
    "+ disorder in other bh parameters , like the tunneling rates or the inter - particle interactions , has not been studied as intensively as disorder in the on - site potentials .",

    "disorder of the tunneling rates has been studied within smf theory @xcite for a uniform distribution .",
    "other works on disordered tunneling rates focus on bimodal distributions .",
    "+ experimentally , disorder can be introduced either by a speckle field @xcite or by a bichromatic quasi - periodic lattice produced by two lasers with incommensurate wave lengths @xcite . while the distributions of the bh parameters resulting from speckle fields have been studied in @xcite , in this paper",
    "we focus on bosons in two - dimensional bichromatic quasi - periodic potentials and analyze the distribution of all of the bh parameters , i.e. on - site potential , hopping strength and interaction energies , by determining the generalized wannier functions and calculating the corresponding bh parameters . +",
    "this paper is organized as follows : first , we discuss the bh model and the lmf cluster analysis in section [ section : model ] . in section [ scenarios ]",
    "we determine the phase diagrams of the disordered bh model for three different cases of uncorrelated disorder for comparison : exclusively random on - site potentials , exclusively random hopping strengths and exclusively random interaction energies . in section [ quasi - periodic ] the bh parameters",
    "are calculated for a two - dimensional bichromatic quasi - periodic potential and their distributions are characterized .",
    "these are finally used in section [ phase diagrams of the bichromatic potential ] to determine the phase diagrams .",
    "the paper concludes with a discussion .",
    "the bh hamiltonian describing bosons in an optical lattice @xcite is given by @xmath0 the operator @xmath1 is the particle number operator of bosons on site @xmath2 , which are annihilated and created by the operators @xmath3 and @xmath4 . the site index @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the number of sites in a @xmath7 2d lattice , represents a tuple of spatial coordinates @xmath8 with @xmath9 .",
    "the chemical potential is denoted by @xmath10 , the inter particle repulsion by @xmath11 and the tunneling rate by @xmath12 .",
    "the last sum runs over all four ( @xmath13 ) nearest neighbor pairs @xmath14 of the lattice .",
    "+ in the ordered case , the @xmath15-@xmath16 phase diagram displays the well - known mott - lobes with boundaries given in lmf theory by @xcite @xmath17 inside the mott - lobes the particle number is fixed to an integer value @xmath18 .",
    "they are aligned along the @xmath10-axis and the particle number increases from lobe to lobe with growing @xmath10 . in this region particle tunneling is prohibited due to the existence of an energy gap in the particle excitation spectrum .",
    "the mott - lobes are surrounded by the sf phase , where particle tunneling is favorable and coherence grows with increasing tunneling rate . + in the case of on - site disorder , the bg phase occurs between the mi and sf phase . in this phase",
    "the system is compressible , but not sf . in the present paper",
    "we will not restrict to on - site disorder , but rather study the influence of disorder on all bh parameters .",
    "therefore , all bh parameters , except the chemical potential @xmath10 , which is a global parameter fixing the particle number , now become site dependent : @xmath19 the sf parameter @xmath20 is defined as the expectation value of the annihilation operator and can be chosen to be real because of the @xmath21symmetry of the bh - hamiltonian . with the help of the lmf approximation @xcite @xmath22",
    "the hamiltonian can be transformed into a sum of local hamiltonians @xmath23 , @xmath24 which are effectively coupled by a local hopping rate @xmath25 , which depends on the local sf parameter of the neighboring sites with @xmath26 for @xmath2 and @xmath27 being nearest neighbors on the square lattice with periodic boundary conditions and zero otherwise .",
    "one should note that mean field approximations as the one used here neglect spatial correlations of quantum fluctuations , which is less severe in high space dimensions .",
    "actually it is exact in infinite dimensions and reproduces the exact critical behavior already above the upper critical dimension , which is unknown for the system we consider here but certainly larger than @xmath28 .",
    "consequently , we expect the approximation to be critically inaccurate for 1d systems and therefore , focus on two space dimensions",
    ". we would expect the predictions of our lmf analysis to be even more accurate for three dimensions , but 3d systems are computationally much more demanding .",
    "+ since the hamiltonian itself depends on the sf parameter @xcite , the self - consistency equation is solved recursively in order to find the ground state of the lmf hamiltonian . in turn",
    "all local parameters of interest , especially the local particle number @xmath29 , can be computed . in order to determine the phase boundaries ,",
    "several steps are needed @xcite : first , we define and identify so - called mi and sf sites .",
    "sites with an integer number of particles are called mi sites .",
    "note that the lmf approximation neglects quantum fluctuations and predicts an integer expectation value for the local particle number for some site even in the presence of disorder in the bh parameters .",
    "sites with non - integer expectation value of the local particle number are denoted as sf sites . in a second step",
    "all three occurring phase are identified : in the mi phase the system only consists of mi sites and no sf site occurs .",
    "the bg is characterized by a mixture of mi and sf sites , more precisely by isolated clusters ( islands ) of sf sites within a sea of mi sites . in @xcite",
    "we discussed how this definition is physically plausible regarding the conventional hallmarks of the bg phase , namely the lack of coherence and a gapless spectrum .",
    "since the particle number fluctuates within the isolated sf clusters only the sites within a single cluster can be phase coherent , sites in different clusters are not , which establishes the lack of macroscopic phase coherence .",
    "moreover , the bg phase is actually the griffiths phase of the bh model ( see @xcite for a discussion ) , where the isolated sf clusters behave like finite systems within the sf phase and therefore , have a very small gap that decreases quickly with the size of the sf cluster .",
    "since sf clusters can be arbitrarily large there is no lower bound for the gap and thus the bg phase is gapless . while approaching the bg - sf transition the regions with sf site grow , form connected clusters , which finally percolate .",
    "the percolation of the sf sites marks the transition to the sf phase .",
    "we call this scheme the lmf cluster analysis approach , which is described and discussed in @xcite .",
    "in contrast to other lmf approaches we show , that the lmf cluster analysis reproduces the phase diagram predicted by quantum monte carlo @xcite with excellent accuracy .",
    "before we focus on the bichromatic quasi - periodic potential , we analyze the effect of uncorrelated disorder in each of the bh parameter @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 separately . here",
    "we determine , with the lmf cluster analysis , the phase diagram for a uniform distribution for each bh parameter separately .",
    "while all three phases can be found in each disorder scenario , we find substantial differences in the phase diagrams .",
    "the most common disorder scenario is diagonal disorder introduced by site - dependent local on - site energies @xmath30 , which are drawn from a box distribution .",

    "+ while the field of box on - site disorder was studied widely @xcite , the works on tunneling disorder are rare and mainly deal with bimodal distributions @xcite . a phase diagram far above the critical disorder strength @xmath128 for equally distributed tunneling disorder is shown in @xcite .",
    "+ the one - dimensional bh model with a bichromatic on - site potential with incommensurable wave lengths was studied in @xcite .",
    "the motivation there was , as also in this paper , to qualitatively understand the phase diagram of bosons in a bichromatic quasi - periodic potential , but it was argued that the variations in the hopping strengths as well as in the in the interaction energies were only minor and could be neglected .",
    "although , we have shown here by explicit calculation that the disorder strength in the tunneling strengths is indeed one order of magnitude smaller than the on - site disorder , it nevertheless has a strong effect on the 2d phase diagram .",
    "the most striking difference is that the phase diagrams of @xcite show a direct mi - sf transition ( which for quasi - period disorder is not in contradiction with general predictions for uncorrelated disorder @xcite ) , whereas we find an intervening bg phase between the mi and the sf phase for all values of the laser intensities @xmath88 and @xmath124 .",
    "a reason for this , in addition to potentially qualitative differences between one and two dimensions , could be that our results for uncorrelated disorder in section [ scenarios ] show that a modest amount of disorder in the hopping strength already generates relatively large bg regions in the phase diagram ( see ) . consequently , disorder in the hopping strengths can not be neglected studying bosons in a bichromatic quasi - periodic potential .",
    "+ conversely , one should be aware that experimental realizations of the disordered potential by a bichromatic quasi - period potential , as in @xcite , produce a phase diagram that is qualitatively very different from the predictions of the disordered bh model with exclusively on - site disorder .",
