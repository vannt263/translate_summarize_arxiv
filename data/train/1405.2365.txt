    "in 2012 the hyphi collaboration @xcite reported evidence that the neutron - rich system @xmath0 was bound ( the hypernucleus @xmath6 ) , based upon observation of the two - body and three - body decay modes .",
    "this claim is very significant for hypernuclear physics for the following reason : one research goal in hypernuclear physics is to study new dynamical features obtained by adding a @xmath7 particle to a nucleus . in this vein",
    "it is interesting to explore the resulting structure of neutron - rich @xmath7 hypernuclei .",
    "core nuclei corresponding to neutron - rich systems can be weakly bound halo states or even resonant states .",
    "when a @xmath7 particle is added to such a nuclear core , the resultant hypernuclei will become more stable against neutron decay , due to the attraction of the @xmath8 interaction .",
    "the @xmath6 system would be the lightest such example that might be bound , one in which a @xmath7 is bound to a di - neutron ( @xmath9 ) pair .",
    "another important goal of studying @xmath7 hypernuclei is the extraction of information about the effect of @xmath1 coupling . for this purpose",

    "@xcite utilized a coupled - channel two - body model of @xmath11 , and later , akaishi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite analyzed the role of the @xmath1 coupling for the @xmath12-@xmath13 splitting within the same framework .",
    "it is necessary to perform four - body coupled - channel calculations to investigate the role of @xmath1 coupling .",
    "four - body coupled - channel calculations with separable potentials that were central in nature were performed by the authors of ref .",
    "carlson then carried out four - body calculations with the nsc89 potential model using variational monte carlo methods @xcite , and he obtained binding energies with statistical errors of 100 kev .",
    "later , one of the authors ( e.h . ) performed four - body coupled - channel calculations  @xcite using a @xmath1 coupled - channel @xmath2 potential  @xcite with central , spin - orbit , and tensor terms which simulates the scattering phase shifts given by nsc97f  @xcite .",
    "a four - body calculation of @xmath5he and @xmath5h and a five - body calculation of @xmath14he using the same @xmath2 interaction were performed by nemura _",

    "@xmath1 coupling plays a crucial role in charge symmetry breaking as well as in the ground states being 0@xmath15 .",
    "however , the nature of @xmath1 mixing is not fully understood .",
    "the hypertriton @xmath4h is bound .",
    "if @xmath6 were also bound , the pair would provide complementary information about @xmath1 coupling .",
    "it is thought that @xmath1 coupling may also play an important role in the structure of heavier neutron - rich @xmath7 hypernuclei , because of the increasing total isospin .",
    "for example , a recent finuda experiment @xcite reported a heretofore unobserved bound state of the superheavy hydrogen-@xmath7 hypernucleus @xmath16h .",
    "furthermore , in 2013 , another light neutron - rich @xmath7 hypernucleus bound state , @xmath17he , was observed at jlab @xcite . among the observed neutron - rich @xmath7 hypernuclei , @xmath6 would be a unique neutron - rich @xmath7 hypernucleus , one containing no protons .",
    "thus , measuring the binding energy of a bound @xmath6 system would contribute directly to understanding the structure of neutron - rich @xmath7 hypernuclei and to understanding the nature of @xmath1 coupling .",
    "however , no binding energy was reported for @xmath6 by the hyphi collaboration .",
    "given the current situation , an important theoretical issue to address is whether a bound state of @xmath6 can exist .",
    "in addition , it is imperative that an estimate of the binding of any such bound system be calculated . in such an analysis it is important that the interactions employed be realistic and constrained by the known data for the s - shell @xmath7 hypernuclei .",
    "@xmath1 coupling should be a component of the @xmath2 interactions used in the investigation .",
    "previously , in ref .",
    "@xcite , a three - body calculation of @xmath6 was performed using a variational method and a @xmath8 interaction without @xmath1 coupling ; it was concluded that no bound state existed .",
    "recently , a faddeev calculation for this system was performed taking @xmath1 coupling explicitly into account @xcite ; again , no bound state was found .",
    "thus , previous theoretical predictions are inconsistent with the conclusion based upon the new observation of the decay modes for a bound @xmath6 as reported by the hyphi collaboration  @xcite . here , motivated by experimental and theoretical studies , the goal of this work is to investigate the possibility of the existence of a bound state in this system using realistic @xmath2 interactions with @xmath1 coupling explicitly taken into account .",
