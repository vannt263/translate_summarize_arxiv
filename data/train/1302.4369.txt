    "deflection of light by a massive body , as predicted by general relativity , led to one of the first experimental verifications of the theory @xcite .",
    "deflection of light is also the mechanism behind the rich phenomenology of gravitational lensing that has seen a wide range of applications in astrophysics @xcite . in observationally relevant circumstances ,",
    "gravitational lensing occurs in the so - called weak deflection regime ; the light passes by a massive body at distances that are much greater than the schwarzschild radius corresponding to the mass , and the overall angle of deflection is small .",
    "however , despite known difficulties on the observational side , there is also considerable interest in gravitational lensing in the strong deflection regime , see e.g.  @xcite and references therein .",
    "this primarily includes the case of lensing by the schwarzschild black hole @xcite , by the regular black hole @xcite or by other types of black holes , see @xcite for a review .",
    "light passing sufficiently close to the schwarzschild black hole may , due to the presence of the photon sphere in the spacetime , suffer an arbitrarily large deflection as it makes one or more complete turns around it before escaping to spatial infinity . in the context of gravitational lensing , this leads to the formation of the so - called relativistic images .",
    "a mathematically rigorous treatment of the concept of the photon sphere can be found in @xcite .    in this paper , we look for a simple matter model that can be used to construct static , spherically symmetric self - gravitating bodies that curve the spacetime in such a way that photon spheres are formed . in this",
    "regard , one is faced with two possible routes .",
    "one is to construct a compact body , i.e.  a body that is finite in the radial extent , with the surface lying below the photon sphere of the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "if such a body is assumed to be non - transparent to photons , then its properties as a gravitational lens are equivalent to those of a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "the other more interesting route is to allow the energy - momentum content to take up all space and assume that the matter it describes is transparent to light . the simplest matter model for which it is natural to assume that it does not interact electromagnetically is the scalar field .",
    "for example , lensing by the configurations of a massless scalar field with a naked spacetime singularity was studied in @xcite .",
    "as we intend to show , photon spheres can form within the regular objects formed of scalar fields known as boson stars .",
    "boson stars were originally conceived as klein ",
    "gordon geons @xcite , the self - gravitating configurations of the free massive scalar field minimally coupled to gravity , while among the extensions of the original model one finds a quartic self - interaction @xcite , nonminimal coupling to gravity @xmath0 , addition of the brans  dicke field @xcite , etc .",
    "due to their simplicity , boson stars proved to be an attractive theoretical model for studying the properties of self - gravitating objects in general relativity .",
    "they were also considered as candidates for astrophysical objects such as supermassive sgr  @xmath1 at the centre of our galaxy @xcite .",
    "several reports on the subject appeared over the past decades @xcite .",
    "gravitational lensing by boson stars was considered in @xcite ; relatively large angles of deflection of light forming primary and secondary images were found , but the possibility of formation of photon spheres and relativistic images was not reported so far .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : notation ] , we give a brief overview of the properties of null - geodesics in a static , spherically symmetric , asymptotically flat spacetime with photon spheres and introduce the notation that will be used throughout the rest of the paper .",
    "we also discuss a simple analytical model of a compact body with the surface within the schwarzschild photon sphere . in section [ sec : bstar ] , we construct boson stars from a free massive complex scalar field nonminimally coupled to gravity and show that photon spheres form in some configurations .",
    "we sum up in section [ sec : concl ] .",
    "we will be considering the behaviour of null - geodesics in static , spherically symmetric , asymptotically flat spacetimes , free of singularities or black holes .",
    "the line element can be written using the coordinates @xmath2 and geometrized units ( @xmath3 ) as @xmath4 where the radial coordinate @xmath5 is the area radius and @xmath6 is the line element on the unit sphere .",
    "the schwarzschild spacetime contains a black hole of mass @xmath7 with the event horizon at @xmath8 . outside the black hole ,",
    "the metric components of the schwarzschild spacetime are given by @xmath9 @xmath10 being the adm mass of the spacetime .",
    "we will encounter the situation where the the energy - momentum tensor vanishes at radii greater than some constant @xmath11 and where the metric components are given by ( [ eq : sch ] ) exactly , as well as situations where nonzero energy - momentum takes up all space and where ( [ eq : sch ] ) only represents the asymptotic form of the metric as @xmath12 .",
    "the lagrangian for the geodesics constrained to the @xmath13 plane can be written as @xmath14 where the overdot denotes differentiation with respect to the parameter of the geodesic and the choice of the sign depends on whether the geodesic is spacelike ( @xmath15 ) or timelike ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "as @xmath17 does not depend on @xmath18 and @xmath19 , there are two constants of motion , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the ratio of the two constants , @xmath22 is proportional to the angular momentum of the test particle following a timelike geodesic and is known as the impact parameter . for a geodesic that can be extended to spatial infinity , i.e.  to the region where the spacetime is essentially flat",
    ", the absolute value of the impact parameter can be interpreted as the distance between the considered geodesic and the purely radial geodesic that is ( at spatial infinity ) parallel to it .    by continuity , the impact parameter @xmath23 defined in ( [ eq : bdef ] ) is a constant of motion also for the null - geodesics , where in addition we have @xmath24 . eliminating @xmath25",
    "one obtains an equation for @xmath26 that can be written in the form of the nonrelativistic energy equation , @xmath27 where @xmath28 and the ` effective potential ' @xmath29 is given by @xmath30 in analogy with the familiar scenario from classical mechanics , we see that null - geodesics exist only where @xmath31 , as the rhs of ( [ eq : drdt ] ) must be non - negative for @xmath26 to be real . if @xmath32 , then at @xmath33 , there is a turning point of @xmath34 if @xmath35 , or an equilibrium point if @xmath36 .",
    "a turning point is an inner turning point ( a minimum of @xmath34 ) if @xmath37 ; it is an outer turning point ( a maximum of @xmath34 ) if @xmath38 .",
    "an equilibrium point of @xmath34 implies the existence of closed ( circular ) null - geodesics along equators of the hypersurface @xmath33 which is known as the photon sphere .",
    "a photon sphere is said to be stable if @xmath39 , or unstable if @xmath40 . in the neighborhood of a stable photon sphere ,",
    "there are bound null - geodesics with oscillatory @xmath34 such that the outer turning point is above and the inner turning point is below the photon sphere .",
    "apart from circular null - geodesics , an unstable photon sphere implies the existence of null - geodesics that asymptotically approach the photon sphere , either from the inner or from the outer side , making an infinite number of turns around it .",
    "it can be shown that the outermost photon sphere in an asymptotically flat , static , spherically symmetric spacetime is an unstable photon sphere .    to access the properties of null - geodesics in a given static spherically symmetric spacetime in a systematic way it is convenient to consider the relation among the impact parameter @xmath23 and the radial coordinates of turning points or photon spheres @xmath41 .",
    "this relation follows from the condition @xmath42 or @xmath32 , and reads @xmath43 the double sign in ( [ eq : br0 ] ) corresponds to the sign of the angular momentum or the time direction one chooses along the given null - geodesic . for simplicity of notation , with no loss in generality",
    ", we will assume a positive @xmath23 in what follows .",
    "it can be easily shown that solutions to ( [ eq : br0 ] ) with @xmath44 represent inner turning points , while those with @xmath45 represent outer turning points of null - geodesics ; the solutions with @xmath46 and @xmath47 represent stable , while those @xmath48 represent unstable photon spheres in the spacetime .",
    "let us first consider the region of the schwarzschild spacetime outside the black hole where the metric components are given by ( [ eq : sch ] ) .",
    "there is no solution to ( [ eq : br0 ] ) with @xmath49 for the impact parameter @xmath50 .",
    "this implies that null - geodesics with @xmath50 extend to spatial infinity at one end , while their other end reaches the black hole horizon . at @xmath51",
    ", there is the unstable photon sphere with an area radius @xmath52 ( see point @xmath53 in figure  [ fig : one ] ) . for @xmath54 ,",
    "one finds two turning points .",
    "the inner turning point with @xmath55 and with the asymptote @xmath56 as @xmath57 represents the closest approach of the null - geodesics extending to spatial infinity .",
    "the outer turning point with @xmath58 and with the asymptote @xmath59 as @xmath57 represents the outermost point reached by the geodesics with both ends at the black hole horizon .",
    "we now proceed to replace the central segment of the schwarzschild spacetime containing the black hole of mass @xmath10 with an exact solution of the einstein equations representing a static spherical body ( compact object ) of mass @xmath10 and surface radius @xmath11 .",
    "we choose to do so in such a way that the joining hypersurface @xmath60 lies inside the schwarzschild photon sphere , i.e.  we require @xmath61 .",
    "this implies that the ratio @xmath62 , known as the surface compactness of the body , belongs to the highly relativistic regime , @xmath63 here , one recalls buchdahl s upper bound on the surface compactness for bodies involving isotropic pressures in their interior @xcite , @xmath64 , and also that many stellar models develop disturbing features such as violation of the energy conditions or loss of dynamical stability at high values of surface compactness",
    ". however , simple models of massive bodies with sufficiently high surface compactness to satisfy condition ( [ eq : mu23 ] ) can be found , and we choose here to work with a model consisting of a massive spherical shell of infinitesimal thickness supported against gravity by its own surface pressure .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that for the case of the flat metric in the shell interior , this model allows the surface compactness as high as @xmath65 without the violation of the dominant energy condition .",
    "the metric components inside the shell are given by @xmath66 it is important to note that joining metrics ( [ eq : sch ] ) and ( [ eq : int ] ) at @xmath60 is not smooth . while @xmath67 is continuous , @xmath68 has a discontinuity at @xmath60 .",
    "this feature is closely related to the @xmath69-shaped distribution of matter of the massive shell along the radial coordinate .",
    "the full technical details of the construction of the energy - momentum tensor on the hypersurface @xmath60 which involves the application of israel s thin shell formalism @xcite are not needed for this discussion ; we refer the interested reader to @xcite or to @xcite where a similar model with a segment of the de sitter spacetime in the interior , known as the gravastar , is worked out in detail .",

    "another interesting feature of global ( no black holes ) spherically symmetric spacetimes with photon spheres , relative to those with black holes , is the high degree of focusing of the incident light into the small central region of the spacetime . for the boson stars that we have considered , we were able to give a measure of contraction of the incident bundle of parallel null - geodesics in the form of the ratio ( [ eq : ratio ] ) .",
    "however , one must not overlook the not - so - desirable properties of the configurations of boson stars in which photon spheres were found . in the case of the minimally coupled field ( @xmath139 ) ,",
    "photon spheres were found in configurations that are known to be dynamically unstable and that have positive binding energy ( positive work is required to ` compress ' the bosons with initially zero kinetic energy at spatial infinity into the equilibrium configuration ) .",
    "as we have shown , the unusual sign of the binding energy of the configurations with photon spheres can be reversed with the introduction of sufficiently strong nonminimal coupling of the scalar field to gravity , but the issue of instability remains open . in this regard , it would be interesting to carry out the linearized perturbation analysis for the boson stars with a nonminimally coupled field ( e.g.  like it has been done for @xmath139 in @xcite ) and if unstable modes are found in the configurations with photon spheres , to obtain the timescales of the growing perturbations . if these are found to be long relative to some time scale reflecting the size of the spacetime region in which gravitational lensing is taking place , then the boson stars with photon spheres would not be ruled out on the basis of instability as models of massive dark objects giving raise to phenomena of strong gravitational lensing .",
    "the possible extension of this work could be to explicitly study the angular pattern , magnifications and time delays of the relativistic images formed by boson stars , and compare them with the results that are obtained when the massive dark objects in the centres of nearby galaxies are modelled as black holes @xcite .",
