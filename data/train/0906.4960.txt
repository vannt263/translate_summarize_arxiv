    "an example of such an application is the use of a qubit as a measuring device in the realization of full counting statistics @xcite ; in a similar spirit , an iterative phase estimation algorithm has been proposed as a testbed application for a limited amount of qubits , in particular , a two - qubit benchmark @xcite . here , we discuss other applications where a few qubits serve as active or passive detectors . the core element on the algorithmic side is a specific physical setup with @xmath2 qubits allowing to perform a ( non - demolition ) count of the elements @xmath3 in a stream of particles flowing in a quantum wire , i.e. , determining its cardinality .",

    "we position ourselves at the interface between information theory and its application in mesoscopic physics ; rather than universal , our quantum counting scheme is a special purpose algorithm , admitting a relatively simple implementation while offering practical applications .",

    "the passage of @xmath8 particles rotates the @xmath5-th spin by the amount @xmath56 . in particular , the first spin is rotated by the angle @xmath57 and either points upward if the number s parity is even ( we store a ` 0 ' in the first position of the binary number ) or downward ( we store a ` 1 ' in the first position of the binary number ) if the parity is odd . hence the measurement of the first spin along the @xmath21-axis provides already the parity of the number ( note that we had to perform @xmath58 operations in the classical algorithm to find the parity ) .",
    "in addition , the first spin will determine the axis in the measurement of the second spin : for an even @xmath8 , we measure @xmath59 along the @xmath21-axis ( and store a 0 if the spin is pointing up and a 1 if the spin is pointing down ) , while for an odd - parity @xmath8 , we measure @xmath59 along the @xmath19-axis . more specifically , if @xmath60 , with @xmath61 the number of full rotations of the spin number 2 , the state of the first spin signals even parity and the second spin , measured along the @xmath21 direction , points into the direction @xmath43 , hence we store a ` 0 ' in the second position of the binary number .",
    "similarly , for @xmath62 , the spin 2 is directed along @xmath63 ; spin 1 signals odd parity , the measurement is done along the @xmath19-axis , and we store a ` 0 ' . for @xmath64 ,",
    "spin 2 is directed along @xmath65 ( even parity , measurement along @xmath21 , store ` 1 ' ) , and for @xmath66 the spin 2 is directed along @xmath67 ( odd parity , measurement along @xmath19 , store ` 1 ' ) .",
    "the iteration of the algoritm is straightforward : the @xmath5-th spin is measured along the angle @xmath68 with the integer @xmath69 corresponding to the binary number encoded in the @xmath6 previous measurements . the @xmath5-th position in the binary register then assumes a value 0 or 1 depending on the measurement result , 0 for a spin pointing along the axis and 1 for a spin pointing opposite .",
    "the entire algorithm requires @xmath70 steps ( @xmath71 is the closest integer @xmath72 ) , the same number as bits required to store the number @xmath8 in binary form , and provides an exponential speedup compared with the classical algorithm .",
    "a variant of the above counting algorithm is a test for divisibility by powers of two : given a finite train of electrons propagating in a wire , we wish to check whether the number of electrons in the train ( its cardinality ) is divisible by @xmath7 .",
    "obviously , the information on the divisibility of the train s cardinality by @xmath7 is reduced as compared to the information on its cardinality ; correspondingly , we expect a reduced effort to achieve this task . indeed , using the above setup ,",
    "the divisibility check involves @xmath2 qubits and their simultaneous measurement along the @xmath21-axis at the end of the train s passage ( rather than the conditional measurement above ) .",
    "the train s cardinality is divisible by @xmath7 , if all spins are pointing up , i.e. , along the positive @xmath21-axis , cf .",
    "[ fig : counting](b ) ; the non - divisibility is signalled by the ` opposite ' outcome , i.e. , there is at least one spin pointing down .",
    "the above statement relies on the fact , that after the passage of @xmath73 particles all counters end up in the spin - up state , while for @xmath74 there is exactly one spin residing in a spin - down state , cf .",
    "fig.[fig : counting](b ) ( note the difference in having counters in up / down states with well defined measurement outcomes and statistical results of up / down measurements for counters pointing away from the @xmath21 direction ) . we provide a formal proof of this statement : starting in the initial state ( with the quantization axis along @xmath23 ) @xmath75 , after passage of @xmath8 particles , the @xmath5-th spin ends up in the final state latexmath:[$|\\mathrm{f}\\rangle = [ e^{\\pi i n/2^j } |\\!\\uparrow\\rangle + i e^{-\\pi i n/2^j }    along the @xmath43-direction is @xmath77 , @xmath78 .",
    "there is exactly one spin @xmath79 , for which this probability vanishes : this follows from the statement , that any number @xmath80 can be represented in the form @xmath81 with @xmath82 and @xmath83 an odd integer .",
    "then , for the spin @xmath84 ( and only for this spin ) the phase @xmath85 is an odd multiple of @xmath86 and hence the probability @xmath87 to find it pointing along @xmath43 vanishes , i.e. , the spin is pointing down .",
    "for all other spins @xmath88 , the phase is a multiple of @xmath89 ( for @xmath90 , the spin is pointing up ) or a fraction @xmath91 of @xmath86 ( for @xmath92 , the spin is not pointing down ) .",
    "the spins required in the above counting- and divisibility - check algorithms can be implemented using various types of qubits ; note that , while the special nature of our algorithm avoids the large number of qubits and huge network complexity of a general - purpose quantum computer , we do require individual qubits with high performance .",
    "most qubits naturally couple to the electrons in the quantum wire , either via the gauge field ( current ) or via the scalar potential ( charge ) .",
    "the coupling to charge is strong , with typical rotation angles @xmath4 of order @xmath93 , with @xmath94 the wire s length , @xmath95 its distance from the qubit , and @xmath96 the fermi velocity , thus allowing for a @xmath89-phase rotation upon passage of one unit of charge .",
    "transverse coupling via the current is weak , usually requiring enhancement with a flux transformer , cf.the discussion in ref .  .",
    "to fix ideas , below we discuss an implementation with charge qubits in the form of double quantum dots ( dqd ) as one attractive possibility which can be manipulated via electronic gates and offers various modes of operation .",
    "dqds have been implemented in gaas / algaas heterostructures @xcite or as an isolated ( leadless ) version in si technology @xcite , the former with typical oscillation frequencies in the few ghz regime and nano - second phase decoherence times , resulting in quality factors of order @xmath97 to @xmath98 ; characteristic tunneling couplings / decoherence times are a factor 100 smaller / larger in the isolated qubit @xcite . alternatively",

    "the above qubit characteristics have to be compared with the typical time scale of electronic transport in the wire .",
    "while under dc bias conditions , subsequent electrons are separated by the voltage time @xmath100 , single - electron wave packets can be generated by unit - flux voltage pulses of lorentzian shape @xcite .",

    "the time separation of the particle wavepackets can be enlarged , while compromising between leaving sufficient time for the manipulation of the splitter and keeping the system coherent .    for two particles , the bell test for the pseudo - spin ` singlet ' state @xmath220 is particularly simple , as the four polarization angles @xmath221 can all be chosen to reside in the first quadrant , thus keeping the manipulation of the beam splitter simple : the maximum violation is obtained for the usual @xcite angles @xmath222 and @xmath223 ( the indices 1(2 ) refer to the first ( second ) particle ) .",

    "such an analysis , although not as rigorous as the classic bell - inequality test but much simpler to implement , may nevertheless serve as a preliminary indicator for the presence of entanglement .",
    "in conclusion , the simple spin counter in the ` gedanken experiment ' of full counting statistics proves itself a fruitful idea  not only can it be implemented as a real counting device with the help of quantum bits , its generalization to many qubits combined with a non - trivial measurement protocoll allows for the fabrication of a ` quantum cardinality counter ' , where a ` primitive ' physical information ( rather than a binary one ) can be transformed into a binary form or directly used in the control and manipulation of other  in particular quantum ",
