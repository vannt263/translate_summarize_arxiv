    "a pixel ratio ( defined as the ratio of the area formed by the original pixel scale , 1.22 arcsec / px , to that of the mosaiced pixel scale ) of 2 was adopted for making the mosaic ( which gives a mosaic pixel scale of 0.86 arcsec / pixel ) . using these procedures ,",

    "@xcite and @xcite formulated division criteria for various pre - main - sequence classes such as classes 0/i , i , ii and iii .",
    "these criteria have since been refined by several authors ( e.g. , @xcite and the references therein ) , in order to account for possible contaminations from broad - line agns , pah - emitting galaxies , shocked emission blobs / knots and unresolved pah - emission - contaminated apertures , which may lead to wrongful identifications of ysos .",
    "we used the updated criteria given clearly in the appendix a of @xcite to delineate the pms sources .",
    "the total number of point sources identified that are common to all the four irac bands is 3376 ; of these , 235 sources are found to be contaminations ( 1 pah galaxy , 6 shocked emissions , 228 pah aperture - contaminations ) , while there are 327 ysos .    after removing the contaminants",
    ", we used the criteria based on the spectral index , @xmath11 (= dlog(@xmath12f@xmath13)/dlog(@xmath12 ) ) , to classify the ysos ( numbering 327 as shown above ) into different evolutionary classes ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we followed @xcite in the classification of class 0/i as sources whose @xmath14 is @xmath15 -0.3 ; class ii as those having -0.3 @xmath15",
    "@xmath14 @xmath15 -1.6 ; and class iii as those having",
    "-1.6 @xmath15 @xmath14 @xmath15 -2.6 ( termed as sources with faint or anemic disks by @xcite ) . in applying these classifications to m8 , we have not considered the flat - spectrum sources ( e.g. , @xcite ) as a separate class but included them in the class 0/i , the sources with in - falling envelopes ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the sources with @xmath14 @xmath16 -2.6 are taken as stars with purely photospheric emissions . with the @xmath14 classification",
    ", we obtain 64 class 0/i , 168 class ii sources and 95 class iii sources .",
    "the rest of the sources , numbering 2814 , are purely photospheric sources .",
    "we then verified the selected sample of ysos for possible interstellar extinction / reddening bias ( see @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "@xcite showed that only for very large values of a@xmath17 do sources , with @xmath14 ranges relevant here , get misclassified as ysos .",
    "such large values are seen only as intrinsic for ysos as may be inferred from the h - k colour .",
    "typically , we can identify the bias by comparing the ratio ( @xmath18 ) of number of class ii sources to that of the class 0/i , for different values of extinction and see if the ratio changes substantially @xcite . in the case of m8 , the visual extinction and the reddening ( defined as the ratio of total to selective extinction , r@xmath17 = a@xmath17/e(b - v ) ) varies from region to region ; and a value of a@xmath17 = 3.2 was determined towards the hourglass region for standard reddening ( r@xmath17 = 3.1 ) @xcite . for the present purpose , however , we compared the ratio @xmath18 , for a@xmath17 values 0.0 , 3.2 and 5.0 .",
    "the ratio @xmath18 remains at 2.63 with a poisson error of @xmath19 0.39 for a@xmath17 0.0 and 3.2 . for a@xmath17",
    "= 5.0 , we get @xmath18 = 2.73@xmath190.42 .",
    "the value of @xmath18 obtained here for m8 is comparable with that obtained for the serpens @xcite and north american nebula @xcite star forming regions , indicating the similarity of ages of these regions .",
    "fig 2 shows the mid - infrared colour - colour diagram constructed from the irac photometry for [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] vs [ 5.8]-[8.0 ] colour . in this diagram",
    "we show the photospheric sources as black dots , and the class 0/i , class ii and class iii sources as open circles , open triangles and open squares .",
    "table 1 lists the class 0/i sources while table 2 gives the class ii sources .",
    "also included in table 1 is the source ks 4 ( no .",
    "26 ; classified as yso by @xcite ) for which irac has detections in chs . 1 & 2 only .",
    "where available , the colours [ j - h ] and [ h - k ] along with the h magnitude from jhk surveys are also given in the tables with references .    in order to obtain quantitatively the spatial distribution of ysos , we adopted the nearest - neighbour technique ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we have followed the suggestion of @xcite to obtain surface density distribution , without a bias towards over - estimation .",
    "we used a 5 arcsec grid to compute the surface number density , defined as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the surface area defined by the radial distance @xmath22 to the @xmath23 (= 5 ) nearest - neighbours .",
    "fig 3 shows the yso spatial density contours with the inner and outer contours representing 10 and 5 ysos / pc@xmath1 respectively .",
    "the maximum densities are about 20 ysos / pc@xmath1 . also shown in the figure",
    "are the spatial distributions of all the 327 ysos ( a ) and the contaminants ( b ) .",
    "one can notice in fig 3 several small clusters ( about 7 ) isolated by the technique used as above .",
    "these clusters are mostly confined to the hourglass , ngc 6530 , m8e and the ridge regions along with two more clumps east of h36 . in order to identify the cluster members as against the isolated or scattered cases",
    ", we computed the empirical cumulative distribution as a function of nearest - neighbour distance and found that the sources within an arbitrarily chosen inflection distance @xmath24 ( that signifies the maximum separation between the cluster members ) of @xmath5 0.75 pc ( 0.03@xmath25 at 1.25 kpc ) . by varying @xmath24 between 0.65 and 0.85 pc ,",
    "the number of cluster members does not change significantly .",
    "the class 0/i and class ii ysos in clusters constitute about 60% of the total number detected and are confined mainly within the yso density contours ( corresponding to about 7 clusters ) shown in fig 3 . in comparison , only about 26 % of the class iii sources ( having `` anemic '' disks ) occur in the clusters . the ratio @xmath18 mentioned before varies from cluster to cluster with an average of 2.29 which is comparable to the one for the entire sample ( 2.63 ) within the poisson errors .",
    "it may be noted here that the surface density of ysos derived by us is very close to the values obtained for star forming regions elsewhere ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it may be noted here that since m8 ( @xmath26 = 5.958 ; @xmath27",
    "= -1.167 ) is located near the mid - plane of the galaxy , there exists a possibilty of our yso sample being still contaminated from other intrinsically  red sources \" , such as agb stars .",
    "recently @xcite prepared an extensive catalogue of such red sources based on the _ spitzer _ glimpse and mipsgal surveys .",
    "while the best way to distinguish between ysos and agb stars is by spectroscopy , these authors showed that the two classes are well separated in the [ 8.0 - 24.0 ] colour space , ysos being redder than agb stars in this space ( see also @xcite ) . since in the present case of m8",
    "we do not have the 24 @xmath0 m data ( from mips ) , we have estimated the agb contamination by using the criteria based on the irac magnitudes and colour space @xcite . since agb stars are unlikely to occur in clusters , we have removed the clustered ysos from our estimates .",
    "we find that our class 0/i and ii samples may be contaminated by agb stars up to about 19% , while we do not find any contamination for our class iii sources . as pointed out by @xcite , these separation criteria ( including [ 8.0 - 24.0 ] colour ) are  only approximate and there is likely to be contamination in both directions \" .",
    "fig 4 shows ch3 ( 5.8 @xmath0 m ) image overlaid by the irac class 0/i ( open circles ) and class ii ( open triangles ) sources identified by using the @xmath14 criteria ( see tables 1 and 2 ) . also shown ( as black star symbols ) in the figure are the positions of sub - mm ( 850@xmath0 m ) gas clumps ( taken from table 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "the yso density contours ( in white ) are also shown in the figure .",
    "a number of the class 0/i and class ii sources occur very close to the dense filamentary / pillar - like structures seen all along the ridge region in the east - west direction as well as perpendicular to it in the central ridge or ngc 6530 region ( see fig 1 ) .",
    "a majority of these sources are found to be present in the vicinity of the sub - mm gas clumps ( marked by black star symbols in fig 4 ) . as mentioned earlier",
    ", m8e is a young compact high - mass star forming region .",
    "the central source of this cluster was resolved into a protostar m8e - ir and m8e - radio , a b2 type star that is responsible for the compact hii region @xcite .",
    "while irac bands are saturated for m8e - ir itself , about 6 class i or flat - spectrum and 10 class ii sources are identified by irac in a region of 4 arcmin@xmath1 around m8e . these sources are not common with those listed in table 6 of @xcite .",
    "we did not find any irac pre - main - sequence sources in the vicinity of the source iras 18014 - 2428 , believed to be another young star forming region ( corresponding to the sub - mm gas clump called se3 @xcite ) .",
    "triggered star formation by the `` collect and collapse '' process @xcite could be responsible for the existence of the irac sources , possibly started by the stellar winds or expanding hii regions associated with the nearby massive stars , viz .",
    "hd 165052 , m8e , hd 164806 , hd 164816 , 9 sgr and her 36 ( see @xcite ) . while the ionization fronts from 9 sgr and her 36 have expanded well into the molecular cloud , that from m8e seems to have started later , as is evident from the bright narrow rim in front of m8e seen in fig 1 .",
    "thus the small cluster in m8e region may be younger than others in the region . @xcite modelled the spectral energy distribution of m8e - ir and concluded that it is a b0 type yso . that the star formation is sequential in m8 starting from north - west regions to southern edge regions",
    "has been shown by @xcite , based on chandra x - ray survey of ngc 6530 region and its neighbourhood in conjunction with 2mass data and optical surveys ( see @xcite for a discussion ) .      as mentioned earlier ,",
    "the irac bands contain a number of prominent molecular lines / features .",
    "ch1 contains h@xmath28 vibrational - rotational lines while ch2 - 4 mostly contain pure rotational lines .",
    "ch1 , 3 and 4 also contain the pah features at 3.3 , 6.2 , 7.7 and 8.6 @xmath0 m ; but ch2 does not include any pah features .",
    "in addition to these molecular lines / features , irac bands also contain hydrogen recombination lines , notably the br@xmath2 line ( 4.05 @xmath0 m ) in ch2 , which can be used to trace hii regions .",
    "several authors have utilised the ratios of irac bands to identify some of the atomic and molecular diagnostics mentioned above ( e.g. , @xcite ) . since it is difficult to assess the contribution of different atomic or molecular transitions to different channels , the ratio maps are only indicative ; until / unless supplemented by spectroscopic evidence .",
    "the ch2 is more sensitive to h@xmath8 lines of high excitation temperatures while the ch4 represents rotational lines of low excitation temperatures @xcite .",
    "likewise , the ch2 does not have any pah features while ch4 has .",
    "thus , in the ratio image of ch2/ch4 , the brighter regions indicate emission regions from higher excitations from h@xmath8 and the darker regions indicate pah emission .",
    "this trend is reversed in the image of ch4/ch2 ( i.e. , bright regions show pah emission and dark regions the h@xmath8 emission ) .",
    "however in hii regions , the h recombination lines ( br@xmath2 and pf@xmath29 ) are more significant contributors to ch2 rather than the h@xmath8 lines .    in order to make the ratio maps , point sources from all the irac images",
    "are removed by using an extended aperture of 12.2 arcsec and sky annulus of 12.2 - 24.4 arcsec in iraf / daophot software @xcite . then these residual frames are subjected to median filtering with a width of 15 pixels and smoothing by 3@xmath33 pixels using `` boxcar '' algorithm @xcite .",
    "fig 5a gives the ratio map of ch2/ch4 in a region of 0.67 @xmath3 0.46 pc@xmath1 around her 36 .",
    "contours overlaid on the ratio map represent the h@xmath2 emission observed by hst ( in f656n filter image extracted from hst public archive ) .",
    "the minimum and maximum values of the contours are 5288 and 14100 counts respectively ; six contours are drawn with interval of 1762 counts . in the vicinity of her 36",
    "the ratio map ch2/ch4 shows bright regions coinciding very nicely with the hourglass hii region ( as traced out by the contours of h@xmath2 ) .",
    "the bright regions coinciding with the hourglass can not be attributed to the molecular hydrogen lines of higher excitation temperature present in ch2 in comparison with those of lower excitation temperature present in ch4 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "further , the molecular hydrogen ( 1 - 0 s(1 ) at 2.12 @xmath0 m ) images presented by @xcite do not show substantial emission around the hourglass region ( refer figs 3 and 4 of @xcite ) .",
    "considering the fact that the irac ch2 also contains hydrogen br@xmath2 line ( as well as pf@xmath29 ( 4.65 @xmath0 m ) ) , we may attribute the bright regions in the ratio map of ch2/ch4 coinciding with hourglass , as due to br@xmath2 ( and pf@xmath29 ) emission .",
    "one can notice narrow bright regions surrounding her 36 ( and the near - ir source ks1 ) in the ratio map of ch2/ch4 .",
    "these regions are coincident with those of molecular hydrogen in @xcite . in these regions",
    "it is likely that the molecular hydrogen transitions of high excitation temperature may be responsible rather than br@xmath2 .",
    "a similar trend is seen in the ratio image of ch2/ch3 also .",
    "fig 5b gives the ratio image ch4/ch2 in the same region as in fig 5a . in this figure ,",
    "the ratio contours are overlaid on ratio image for better clarity and insight .",
    "one can notice a bright ( corresponding to dark region in fig 5a ) `` cavity''-like structure to the east of the hourglass .",
    "actually , this structure occurs towards the east of the regions of very high column density reported by @xcite towards north and east of the hourglass .",
    "it is possible that the pah molecules can be shielded from high energy uv photons by these dense regions .",
    "but the molecules may be excited by the low energy ( non - ionising ) uv photons that can escape from the narrow dense regions between the hourglass and the `` cavity '' .",
    "thus we may attribute the bright tubular structure to pah emissions .",
    "it may be mentioned here that the ratio image of ch2/ch1 does not show the hourglass as prominently as in ch2/ch4 or ch2/ch3 .",
    "this could be because of the fact that ch1 contains pf@xmath6 ( 3.7 @xmath0 m ) and pf@xmath30 ( 3.3 @xmath0 m ) lines which may be cancelling partly the recombination lines in ch2 .",
    "in fact we do clearly see the hourglass hii region in the ratio images of ch1/ch3 and ch1/ch4 also .",
    "thus the ch1 and ch2 bring out well the h recombination emission in the hourglass .",
    "ch4 is unable to depict the hii region in spite of the presence of pf@xmath2 ( 7.5 @xmath0 m ) , mainly because of the fact that its spectral response is inferior to that of ch1 ( or that of ch2 ) @xcite . for a hii region under case",
    "b situation @xcite with a kinetic temperature of 10@xmath31 k and electron densities of 10@xmath1 - 10@xmath32 @xmath33 , the combined relative intensities of pf@xmath6 and pf@xmath30 are a factor of @xmath5 1.4 times lower than that of pf@xmath2 .",
    "hence the combined detected flux of pf@xmath6 and pf@xmath30 in ch1 can exceed that of pf@xmath2 in ch4 .    elsewhere in m8",
    "the ratio maps seem to have a different story to tell .",
    "fig 6 gives the ratio maps of the ridge regions in m8 complex in an area of 24.2 x 20.0 arcmin@xmath1 , to the east / south - east of her 36 : ch1/ch2 ( top ) , ch3/ch2 ( middle ) and ch4/ch2 ( bottom ) .",
    "the ratio images show bright rims corresponding to the filamentary structures all along and perpendicular to the east - west ridge region .",
    "these regions seem to be bright in all bands , except ch2 that is free of pah features .",
    "hence it is tempting to attribute the bright regions seen in the ratio images in fig 6 to the pah features .",
    "it is unlikely that these bright regions are a result of molecular hydrogen emission ; since they occur in all the bands though at different excitation temperatures ( mostly rotational lines ) and should have cancelled each other in the ratio maps .",
    "the important conclusions of this work are as follows :    1 .",
    "_ spitzer _ irac photometry of m8 region revealed 64 class 0/i and 168 class ii ysos .",
    "about 60% of these are present in about 7 small clusters with spatial surface densities of 10 - 20 ysos / pc@xmath1 ; 2 .",
    "these sources are positioned close to the sub - mm gas clumps and the filamentary or pillar like structures present in m8 .",
    "it is possible that the formation of these sources could have been triggered by stellar winds or expanding hii regions associated with the massive stars in the region ; 3 .",
    "the ratio map ch2/ch4 reveals br@xmath2 emission corresponding to the hourglass hii region powered by her 36 and its inverted ratio ( ch4/ch2 ) identifies pah emission in a cavity , east of the hourglass ; 4 .",
