    "more than thirty years after the invention of the scanning tunnelling microscope , stm is still one of the most useful tools for obtaining atomic resolution in surface imaging .",
    "however , in spite of such a long and successful history , the interpretation of stm experiments still raises some , to date unanswered , questions .",
    "the explanation of experimental results relies on long - established electron tunnelling models , which , however , invariably present some level of approximations . the first tunnelling model presented by bardeen @xcite",
    "was based on first - order perturbation theory .",
    "tersoff and hamann @xcite derived a simplified model , where the tip is modelled by a spherically symmetric wave - function , and the electronic structure of the tip is neglected . despite its simplicity",
    ", the method has successfully been used for the simulation of stm , and it is still the most commonly used model . however , as was pointed out by chen @xcite , the symmetry of the tip can have a huge effect on the stm image since the tunnelling matrix elements are proportional to the derivatives of the sample wave - function depending on the tip orbital symmetries .",
    "tip orbitals with non - zero orbital momentum ( e.g. @xmath2 , @xmath0 ) can lead to an enhancement of the corrugation @xcite .",
    "later , the roles of the tip orbital symmetry and electronic structure were emphasized in the stm imaging in several other studies @xcite .",
    "recently , palots _ et al .",
    "_ developed an orbital - dependent tunnelling model and demonstrated the effect of the tip orbitals on the bias - voltage- and tip - sample distance dependence of the atomic contrast inversion on the w(110 ) surface @xcite and on the fe(110 ) surface @xcite . extending this model to include arbitrary tip orientations , they found that different tip orientations can considerably distort the stm image @xcite .",
    "accordingly , it was suggested that a sound interpretation of experimental stm images can not , in principle , be obtained without explicitly accounting for tip - orientation effects .",
    "recent interest in different carbon allotropes ( fullerenes , nanotubes , graphene , graphite ) and nanostructures @xcite , and their potential for a wide spectrum of technological applications @xcite , for example biological and chemical sensors @xcite , nano- and molecular electronics @xcite , photovoltaics @xcite and catalysis @xcite , make atomically resolved investigation of carbon substrates @xmath3 such as highly oriented pyrolytic graphite ( hopg ) @xmath3 of great relevance across many different scientific fields .",
    "hopg(0001 ) is one of the most frequently probed surface , where the tip orbital symmetries play a crucial role .",
    "the tip - dependent corrugation was discussed by tersoff and lang , and the role of the orbital composition of the tip atom was highlighted @xcite .",
    "the two nonequivalent carbon atomic sites of hopg ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) are responsible for different patterns in stm images .",
    "depending on the applied bias voltage and tunnelling current both triangular and hexagonal honeycomb patterns can be observed .",
    "the selective imaging of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 atoms results in a triangular pattern @xcite , which is mostly observed under typical tunnelling conditions , although a honeycomb pattern can be recorded as well @xcite .",
    "_ showed that using a [ 001]-oriented tungsten tip allows for the control of the tip orbitals responsible for the imaging , hence different patterns in the stm image can be obtained @xcite .",
    "_ showed that multiple scattering effects can also play an important role in the near contact regime , and they can result in a triangular pattern in the stm image with hollow sites appearing as bright spots , instead of the carbon atoms @xcite .",
    "et al . _ rationalised the bias dependent stm contrast mechanisms observed on the hopg(0001 ) surface by modelling a set of tungsten tips taking the effects of tip electronic structure , termination , composition , and sharpness into account @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the tip geometry and electronic structure can not be neglected in an accurate stm simulation method .",
    "if the symmetry of the tip orbitals has a considerable effect on the stm image , it follows naturally that so does the tip orientation .",
    "all simulation methods require a well - defined tip geometry and orientation .",
    "usually a simple geometry is chosen , e.g. , a pyramid - shaped tip apex , but the local tip geometry at the apex and the relative orientation of the sample surface and the tip apex are unknown and hardly controllable in experiments . moreover ,",
    "these tip apex characteristics can even change during the experimental stm scan , see e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite for magnetic surfaces . in separate electronic structure calculations of the sample surface and the tip their local coordinate systems",
    "are usually set up in such a way that they represent the corresponding crystallographic symmetries .",
    "the electronic structure data , either the single electron wave - functions or the density of states ( dos ) , are defined in the given local coordinate systems , and they are used in the stm simulations .",
    "thus , the relative orientation of the tip and the sample is fixed , and it usually corresponds to a very symmetrical setup , which is unlikely in experiments .",
    "studied a wide range of tip geometries and spatial orientations in the imaging of the no adsorption on rh(111 ) in combination with stm experiments @xcite , and their analysis is quite unique among the published stm simulations .        in the present work",
    "we employ the three - dimensional ( 3d ) wentzel - kramers - brillouin ( wkb ) electron tunnelling theory implemented in the 3d - wkb - stm code @xcite to study the stm contrast characteristics of the hopg(0001 ) surface as a function of the local orientation of a set of tungsten tips . in the tunnelling model",
    "the tip orientation , defined by the local coordinate system of a crystallographically well - defined tip surface with ( @xmath6 ) miller indices , can be rotated by the euler angles @xmath7 in an arbitrary fashion @xcite . a schematic view of an stm tip with rotated local coordinate system above the hopg(0001 ) surface is shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the systematic effect of local tip rotations is practically unexplored in experiments .",
    "the reason is that there is no direct in - situ information about the local rearrangements of the tip apex structure , e.g. , manifesting as local tip rotations during scanning in an stm equipment , and the atomically precise stability of the tip apex structure is almost impossible to control . as we will demonstrate theoretically",
    ", local tip rotations can have an important effect on the stm contrast .",
    "initially , we compare the 3d - wkb and bardeen tunnelling models with each other and with experimental results using bias dependent topography brightness correlations .",
    "we find quantitatively good agreement for particular tips and bias voltage ranges , and discuss the identified differences .",
    "based on the comparison with experimental data we conclude that the two tunnelling methods perform at the same quantitative reliability at both positive and negative bias voltages .    the paper is organised as follows : after a brief description of computational details in sec .",

    "this suggests two differently rotated local tip apex geometries at the two bias voltages .",
    "we note that in - plane low - barrier sub - apex atomic rearrangements , while maintaining the tip - apex , can lead to an effective rotation of the tip - apex structure ( see for instance the models in figs .",
    "1(b ) and 1(d ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , causing the simulated and measured changes in the stm `` stripes '' .        on the other hand",
    ", it is interesting to find that the primary features of the stm image can change by the same kind of local tip rotation around the @xmath60-axis by @xmath55 .",
    "the requirement for this is a non - zero @xmath61 , i.e. , a tilted @xmath0 tip - apex orbital with respect to the surface normal of the substrate .",
    "[ fig7 ] demonstrates that the stm image contrast can change between the triangular and hexagonal patterns above the hopg surface solely due to the change of the tip orientation by fixing all other tunnelling parameters . for this case",
    "we selected 0.7 v bias voltage , and two orientations of the @xmath52 tip : @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "note that the modelled contrast change is obtained at a @xmath64 difference in @xmath55 , and is expected to be due to enhanced contributions from @xmath1 tip - apex electronic states to the tunnelling current upon tip - rotation @xcite . as a further consequence ,",
    "our simulations indicate that tip instabilities in stm experiments are likely found for local tip - apex geometries described by non - zero @xmath61 angles that also result in distorted stm images @xcite .        note that tip - surface interactions can further complicate the stm contrast . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that multiple scattering effects can induce a contrast change shifting the maximum brightness from @xmath5 carbon to the hollow position above the hopg surface in the near contact regime ( below 4 of tip - sample separation ) . since",
    "our minimum tip - sample distance is always 5.5  , i.e. , we are in the pure tunnelling regime , we expect that the tip - surface force is monotonically decreasing with decreasing current by moving the tip away from the surface .",
    "thus force related changes in the contrast do not modify our conclusions on the effect of the tip orientations observed in stm images in pure tunnelling regimes for tip - surface distances larger than 4  .",
    "however , close to the contact substantial effects of the tip - surface force on the stm contrast can be expected upon tip rotation , which could be interesting to study in the future using an appropriate method .",
    "overall , our findings strongly point to a non - negligible role of the local tip orientation or sub - apex rearrangements for the stm contrast of hopg surfaces .",
    "they also suggest that the tip - apex orientation may have marked effects on the stm appearances of other substrates , and this should be accounted for in stm simulations if aiming at accuracy . in this respect , and given its very favourable computational cost , the 3d - wkb atom - superposition electron tunnelling model @xcite extended to include arbitrary tip orientations @xcite emerges as a very promising tool to explore the role of tip - orientations on the stm contrast of other surfaces .",
    "in this work we studied the stm image contrast of the hopg(0001 ) surface in the tunnelling regime as a function of the local orientation of a set of tungsten tips . employing a three - dimensional ( 3d ) wentzel - kramers - brillouin ( wkb ) tunnelling approach , we demonstrated that the relative local orientation of the stm - tip apex with respect to the hopg substrate can have a considerable effect on the hopg stm contrast .",
    "depending on the stm tip - apex structure and composition , applied bias , and relative orientation with respect to the substrate , substantially different effects , ranging from conservation to inversion of the stm contrast , were observed .",
    "these results were rationalised in terms of the tip - rotation mediated contribution of tip - apex electronic states of different orbital characters to the tunnelling current . for a sharp tungsten tip the hopg contrast inversion between opposite bias polarities",
    "was explained by the different weights of the tip orbital characters involved in the tunnelling that is due to the asymmetry of the tip electronic structure with respect to its fermi level .",
    "we also compared the 3d - wkb and bardeen stm simulation models with each other and with experiments in terms of bias - voltage - dependent stm topography brightness correlations .",
    "we found quantitatively good agreement for particular tip models and bias voltage ranges , and discussed the identified differences in view of the construction of the two tunnelling models . in view of the experiments",
    ", we can also conclude that the two tunnelling methods perform at the same quantitative reliability .",
    "importantly for experimental stm analysis of hopg , the simulations indicate that particular local tip - reconstructions with no orientational change of the dominating @xmath0 tip - apex orbital state affect only the secondary features of the hopg stm contrast , leaving the primary contrast unchanged , thus resulting in a stable tip .",
    "such tip orientations are found to be responsible for `` striped '' images observed in experiments .",

    "<S> highly oriented pyrolytic graphite ( hopg ) is an important substrate in many technological applications and is routinely used as a standard in scanning tunnelling microscopy ( stm ) calibration , which makes the accurate interpretation of the hopg stm contrast of great fundamental and applicative importance . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate by stm simulations based on electronic structure obtained from first principles that the relative local orientation of the stm - tip apex with respect to the hopg substrate has a considerable effect on the hopg stm contrast . </S>",
    "<S> importantly for experimental stm analysis of hopg , the simulations indicate that local tip - rotations maintaining a major contribution of the @xmath0 tip - apex state to the stm current affect only the secondary features of the hopg stm contrast resulting in `` stripe '' formation and leaving the primary contrast unaltered . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , tip - rotations leading to enhanced contributions from @xmath1 tip - apex electronic states can cause a triangular - hexagonal change in the primary contrast . we also report a comparison of two stm simulation models with experiments in terms of bias - voltage - dependent stm topography brightness correlations , and discuss our findings for the hopg(0001 ) surface in combination with tungsten tip models of different sharpnesses and terminations . </S>"
