    "observation of oscillations in solar spicules may be used as an indirect evidence of energy transport from the photosphere towards the corona . transverse motion of spicule axis can be observed by both , spectroscopic and imaging observations .",
    "the periodic doppler shift of spectral lines have been observed from ground based coronagraphs @xcite . but",
    "doppler shift oscillations with period of @xmath2 min also have been observed on the solar and heliospheric observatory ( _ soho _ ) by @xcite .",
    "direct periodic displacement of spicule axes have been found by imaging observations on solar optical telescope ( sot ) on _ hinode _ @xcite .",
    "the observed transverse oscillations of spicule axes were interpreted by kink @xcite and alfvn @xcite waves .",
    "the kink mode , amongst others , differs from the torsional alfvn mode , in that it displaces the whole flux tube in the transverse direction , while torsional mode does not displace the tube at all .",
    "hence the kink mode is a bulk motion of the internal and external plasma , whereas the torsional alfvn mode can exist independently on each magnetic surface . however , despite this significant difference , the kink mode is still highly alfvnic @xcite .",
    "all spicule oscillations events are summarized in a recent review by @xcite .",
    "one of the most important functions of coronal seismology is determining the period ratio @xmath0 between the period @xmath3 of the fundamental mode and the period @xmath4 of its first harmonic .",
    "@xcite analyzed the time series of oxygen line profiles , obtained from sumer / soho on the solar south limb spicules .",
    "they calculated doppler shifts and consequently doppler velocities on a coronal hole region .",
    "they performed wavelet analysis to determine the periods of fundamental mode and its first harmonic mode .",
    "the calculated period ratios have departures from its canonical value of @xmath1 .",
    "different factors such as the effect of density stratification @xcite and magnetic twist @xcite can cause the deviation of the period ratio from its canonical value .    the waves and the period ratio @xmath0 have been studied in coronal loops both theoretically and observationally .",
    "the observed values of this ratio in coronal loops is either smaller or larger than @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "@xcite using simultaneous high spatial and temporal resolution h@xmath5 observations studied the oscillations in the relative intensity to explore the possibility of sausage oscillations in the chromospheric cool post - flare loop .",
    "they used the standard wavelet tool , and find @xmath6 .",
    "they suggested that the oscillations represent the fundamental and the first harmonics of the fast - sausage waves in the cool post - flare loop .",
    "@xcite studied the @xmath0 period ratio of transversal loop oscillations for the diagnostics of longitudinal structuring of coronal loops .",
    "their analysis shows that this ratio is sensitive to the temperature difference between the loop and its environment and this effect should always be taken into account when estimating the degree of density structuring .",
    "@xcite investigated how the radial and longitudinal plasma structuring affects the observational properties of torsional alfvn waves in magnetic flux tubes .",
    "they showed that these waves are the ideal magnetoseismological tool for probing radial plasma inhomogeneity in solar waveguides .",
    "@xcite studied the effects of both density stratification and magnetic field expansion on torsional alfvn waves in coronal loops .",
    "they concluded that the density stratification and magnetic field expansion have opposite effects on the oscillating properties of torsional alfvn waves .    in the present work ,",
    "we study the torsional alfvn waves , and determine the period ratio @xmath0 and eigenfunctions in solar spicules .",
    "we consider an equilibrium configuration in the form of an expanding straight magnetic flux tube with varying density along tube .",
    "we use cylindrical coordinates @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 with the @xmath9-axis coinciding along tube axis .",
    "@xcite claim that about @xmath10 of observed spicule kink waves are standing .",
    "possibly there is a similar percentage of standing torsional alfvn waves in spicules .",
    "so , in what follows we continue on standing torsional alfvn waves with the nodes located at @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 is spicule length ) .    to describe the plasma motion we use the linear ideal mhd equations for a cold plasma ,    @xmath14    and    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the plasma displacement , and @xmath17 is the magnetic field perturbation .",
    "rewriting eqs  [ eq : velo ] ,  [ eq : mag ] in components and considering the time - dependence as @xmath18 yields : @xmath19 and @xmath20    now like @xcite we use non - orthogonal flux coordinate in which @xmath21 becomes an independent variable instead of @xmath7 , i.e. @xmath22 . for an arbitrary function @xmath23 we have the following relations : @xmath24 when deriving these equations we assumed thin tube approximation ( or long - wavelength limit ) , i.e. @xmath25 ( @xmath26 is the radius of expanding spicule ) .",
    "the equilibrium magnetic field has two components , @xmath7 , @xmath9 , and independent of @xmath8 , so that @xmath27 .",
    "it follows from solenoidal condition that @xmath28 can be expressed in terms of flux function @xmath21 ,    @xmath29    differentiating the identities @xmath30 and @xmath31 with respect to @xmath9 and using equation  [ eq : f2 ] yields : @xmath32    by using eqs  [ eq : f3 ] , along with the solenoidal condition , we can simplify eqs  [ eq : velo1 ] ,  [ eq : mag1 ] to    @xmath33    and    @xmath34    eqs  [ eq : velo2 ] ,  [ eq : mag2 ] can now be combined as    @xmath35 = 0.\\ ] ]    it would be more realistic to use the background magnetic field , plasma density , and spicule radius inferred from the actual magnetoseismology of observation @xcite :    @xmath36    where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are magnetic and density scale heights , respectively .",
    "the latter follows from the conservation of magnetic flux . using eqs  [ eq : equlib ] in equation  [ eq : full ] results in    @xmath39    where @xmath40 . in this equation",
    "the lengths are normalized to spicule length ( @xmath13 ) , and frequencies to alfvn frequency ( @xmath41 rad / s ; @xmath42 km / s ; @xmath43 g , @xmath44 kg m@xmath45 , @xmath46 t m a@xmath47 , and @xmath48 km ) .",
    "magnetic and density scale heights are determined as @xmath49 km and @xmath50 km by @xcite .",
    "we solve equation  [ eq : pde ] numerically by using differential transform method ( dtm)(see appendix for detailed description of this method ) to obtain both eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions of standing torsional alfvn waves in stratified and expanding solar spicules .",
    "we use the rigid boundary conditions and assume that @xmath51 .",
    "in figure  [ fig1 ] we plotted torsional alfvn modes frequencies and the period ratio @xmath0 between the period @xmath3 of the fundamental mode and the period @xmath4 of its first harmonic .",
    "frequencies are increasing with an increase of @xmath5 .",
    "the ratio @xmath0 is decreasing with @xmath5 and reaching to observed values around @xmath52 @xmath53 . the fundamental mode and its first harmonic period ratios have departures from its canonical value of @xmath1 .",
    "it is distinguished by observations which were made by @xcite in solar spicules .",
    "@xcite showed that the frequencies of detected kink oscillation overtones are in particular sensitive to the density and the magnetic field expansion .",
    "@xcite showed that the frequencies and the damping rates of both the kink and fluting modes increase when the twist parameter increases .",
    "these two factors are studied in spicules both observationally and theoretically .",

    "they studied a kink wave propagating along a spicule by estimating the spatial change in phase speed and velocity amplitude as a novel approach .",
