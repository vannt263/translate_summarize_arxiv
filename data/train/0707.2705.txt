    "inclusion of the short - range correlation effect ( srce ) is a long - term request for the first - principles electronic structure calculation based on the density functional theory ( dft).@xcite in principles , it is possible , since the strategy introduced by hohenberg , kohn and sham was shown to be given by a rigorous variational principle.@xcite although the method should give formally an exact calculation scheme for the coulomb system , the energy density functional is not perfectly known at present .",
    "plausible approximation schemes have been proposed and utilized.@xcite however , they have their own limitation . for example",
    ", the local - density approximation ( lda ) is known to conclude a metallic ground state for the mott insulator la@xmath1cuo@xmath2.@xcite this failure of lda is a central problem of dft for which we hope inclusion of srce to be a solution .",
    "especially , when lda gives near degeneracy in the ground state , proper treatment of srce can lift the degeneracy to have the non - degenerated ground state implying formation of the mott gap .",
    "this assumption may be widely accepted as a natural conclusion according to the study of the hubbard models.@xcite    here we should note that the kohn - sham scheme has flexibility and it can be adjusted even for the mott insulator . if we introduce a wavefunction of an entangled state as the kohn - sham ground - state wavefunction , the excitation spectrum for the kohn - sham system may change .",
    "this implies that response of the system has changed .",
    "considering the adiabatic shift of the ground state as a function of some outer parameters like the external electro - magnetic field , there should be an essential change as a consequence of the introduction of srce in the kohn - sham scheme . even if we consider the density functional theory for the ground state of the coulomb system , this extended scheme allows us to handle the correlated electron system by the density functional theory .",
    "thus we have yet many possible approaches for the practical computation as realization of the kohn - sham scheme in an extended formulation . actually , the kohn - sham equation is regarded as an auxiliary equation to realize the optimization process of the single particle density @xmath3 . in this paper",
    ", we consider this physical quantity as a central order parameter of the electron system .",
    "usually , a system of non - interacting fermions is utilized to describe @xmath3 in the kohn - sham scheme .",
    "interestingly , we are allowed to consider interacting fermion systems , which can be used to replace the non - interacting kohn - sham system .",
    "this is called the multi - reference density functional theory ( mr - dft).@xcite to develop direct description of a mott insulating state , one of the authors defined a kind of mr - dft.@xcite utilizing this formulation called the extended kohn - sham scheme ( ekss ) , one has a chance to detect coulomb suppression of fluctuation , which is not found in @xmath3 .",
    "the interacting kohn - sham system has been originally motivated in the hybrid approach with the configuration interaction ( ci ) scheme in the theory of the quantum chemistry.@xcite in the hybrid density functional theory , people utilized 1 ) a full or a part of elements or integrals of the density matrix@xcite or 2 ) restriction of the searching space@xcite in the constrained minimization to define the energy density functional .",
    "knowledge on the modified energy density functional , however , are not enough . a proof of existence of the minimum in the constrained search is demanded . on the contrary ,",
    "it is possible to formulate mr - dft in another way by referring the original levy - lieb energy functional.@xcite    in this paper , focusing on the fluctuation reference method,@xcite we will discuss a self - consistent calculation scheme of mr - dft . the method is shown to be a kind of the renormalization method to find a fixed effective interacting hamiltonian .",
    "a practical approximation for the residual exchange - correlation energy functional allows us to confirm that the scheme do give the self - consistent solution .",
    "we will give a report on the first application of our scheme in two types of the hydrogen systems . if we introduce a local density approximation after replacing the residual exchange - correlation energy functional by the ordinal exchange - correlation energy functional , the obtained energy functional",
    "is a kind of the lda+u energy functional .",
    "however , our approach is different from the former lda+u approaches,@xcite because we follow the fluctuation reference method and not primarily looking at the excitation spectrum .",
    "clear difference from the lda+u approach can be seen in the fact that we are able to avoid the clued approximation replacing the residual exchange - correlation energy functional by the ordinal exchange - correlation energy functional .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "2 , we introduce our energy functional . the functional is a wave - function functional . the variational principle is shown . in sec . 3 ,",
    "the idea of the fluctuation reference is introduced .",
