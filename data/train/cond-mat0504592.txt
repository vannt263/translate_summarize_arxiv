    "the past few years have seen extraordinary progress in the description of real - life complex systems in terms of networks or graphs , where nodes represent typical system units and edges represent interactions between connected pairs of units .",
    "such a topological description has been applied for modelling several kinds of natural and man - made systems , and is currently employed to study different processes taking place on real systems ( social , biological , technological , economic ) @xcite .",
    "two highlights of these developments are the watts - strogatz small - world networks @xcite and the so - called scale - free networks @xcite , which incorporate various aspects of real systems .",
    "in particular , they are characterized by the fact that the average separation between sites increases with system size @xmath4 not faster than @xmath12 .",
    "these complex networks provide us with the underlying topological structure to analyze processes such as spread of infections @xcite , signal propagation @xcite , and random spreading of information @xcite .    in the last years ,",
    "researchers have been accumulating evidence @xcite that several kinds of networks possess a degree ( or connectivity , @xmath1 ) distribution given by a power law , @xmath13 , with an exponent @xmath14 usually in the range @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the origin of such power - law degree distributions was addressed by barabsi and albert @xcite , who argued that two ingredients are sufficient to explain the scale - free character of many real - life networks , namely : growth and preferential attachment .",
    "they found that a combination of both criteria yields non - equilibrium scale - free networks with an exponent @xmath16 .",
    "social networks form the substrate where dynamical processes such as information spreading and disease propagation take place @xcite .",
    "these networks have the property of being able to find a target quickly ( they are `` searchable '' ) @xcite , as a consequence of their topological characteristics . to understand several dynamical processes ( diffusion , navigation , search ) on complex networks , several authors have analyzed various properties of random walks on these networks @xcite .",
    "these studies give us valuable information on dynamical processes in real systems , in spite of the fact that actual processes are usually neither purely random nor totally deterministic .",
    "in contrast with unrestricted random walks , self - avoiding walks ( saws ) on a given network can not return to sites visited earlier in the same walk , and one can expect the latter to be more effective for search and exploration .",
    "in fact , this kind of walks have been used to propose local search strategies in scale - free networks @xcite .",
    "however , the self - avoiding condition causes attrition , in the sense that a large fraction of paths generated at random have to be abandoned because they overlap @xcite .",
    "this fact can limit appreciably the capability of saws for exploring real - life networks .",
    "saws on regular lattices have been employed since many years for modelling structural and dynamical properties of macromolecules @xcite , as well as to characterize complex crystal structures @xcite and to study critical phenomena @xcite .",
    "several universal constants for saws on lattices are now well known @xcite . in our context , saws were studied earlier in small - world networks @xcite , and have been also employed to obtain the so - called @xmath17-expansions of complex networks @xcite . recently , kinetic growth walks on uncorrelated scale - free networks were considered , with special emphasis upon the influence of attrition on the maximum length of the paths @xcite .",
    "it was found that the average length scales as a power of the system size , with an exponent that depends on the characteristics of the considered networks .",
    "scale - free networks have a notoriously inhomogeneous distribution of degrees , and it is not yet clear whether properties of saws on these networks are due to that large inhomogeneity , or are general of ( uncorrelated ) complex networks with arbitrary degree distributions @xcite . here",
    "we study kinetically grown walks on random networks with constant degree ( regular graphs ) and with short - tailed degree distributions , and discuss the `` attrition problem '' on these networks .",
    "we obtain the number of surviving walks to a given length @xmath18 by an approximate analytical procedure , and the results are compared with those derived from simulations of different kinds of networks .",
    "results for networks with short - tailed degree distributions are in turn compared with those found for scale - free networks .",
    "we note that the term _ length _ is employed throughout this paper to indicate the ( dimensionless ) number of steps of a walk , as is usual in the literature on networks @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we give some general concepts related to saws , along with definitions of the kinetic growth walks considered here .",
    "sec.iii is devoted to study the self intersection and attrition of growing walks in networks with constant connectivity .",
    "the same properties are studied for walks on networks with short - tailed and scale - free degree distributions in secs .",
    "iv and v respectively .",
    "the paper closes with a discussion in sec.vi .",
    "a self - avoiding walk is defined as a walk along the links of a network which can not intersect itself . in each step",
    "the walk is restricted to moving to a nearest - neighbour node , and the self - avoiding condition constrains the walk to occupy only sites which have not been visited earlier in the same walk . to study several kinds of dynamic processes , such as navigation on networks , one can consider kinetically grown walks , for which a temporal sequence is assumed .     on a realization of a random graph .",
    "open and black circles represent unvisited and visited nodes respectively .",
    "the non - reversal condition allows in principle for the next ( sixth ) step three possible nodes ( denoted @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 ) . for a non - reversal walk one",
    "chooses among nodes @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 . if @xmath19 is selected , then the walk stops . for a kinetic growth walk , one chooses @xmath20 or @xmath21 , each with 50% probability . , height=453 ]    here we will consider two kinds of growing walks",
    ". the first kind will be _ non - reversal _ walks @xcite . in these",
    "walks one randomly chooses the next step from among the neighbouring nodes , excluding the previous one .",
    "if one selects a node visited previously , then the walk stops ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . these walks will be used to study the _ self - intersection length_. the second kind of walks considered here are _ kinetic growth",
    "_ walks ( kgws ) @xcite , in which one randomly chooses the next step among the neighbouring unvisited sites and stops growing when none are available .",
    "these walks were employed to describe the irreversible growth of linear polymers @xcite , and will be used here to study the _ attrition length _ of walks on various kinds of networks .",
    "kgws are less sensitive to attrition than non - reversal walks , in the sense that in the former the walker always escapes whenever a way exists ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . note that both kinds of walks are kinetically grown , but we use the expression ` kinetic growth walks ' to denote those of the second type , as usually done in the literature @xcite .",
    "we call ` non - reversal walks ' those of the first type , to emphasize the fact that the non - reversal condition is the only restriction on this kind of walks , until they reach a node visited earlier .",
    "both ensembles consist of the same set of walks as saws , but each has a weight depending on its growth process .",
    "in particular , for networks in which all nodes have the same degree ( regular networks ) , our non - reversal walks coincide with usual self - avoiding walks , in the sense that all walks of a given length have the same weight .    to analyze the effect of inhomogeneity in the degree distribution on the characteristics of self - avoiding walks",
    ", we will consider three kinds of networks : ( 1 ) random networks with constant degree , ( 2 ) networks with short - tailed degree distribution , and ( 3 ) scale - free networks , with a power - law distribution of degrees .",
    "for simulations we have generated networks with various sizes @xmath4 and mean connectivities @xmath22 .",
    "to generate a network , we first define the number of nodes @xmath23 with degree @xmath1 , following a probability distribution @xmath0 ; second , we ascribe a degree to each node according to the set @xmath24 , and finally we connect randomly ends of links ( giving a total of @xmath25 connections ) , with two conditions : ( i ) no two nodes can have more than one bond connecting them , and ( ii ) no node can be connected by a link to itself . all networks studied here",
    "contain a single component , i.e. any node in a network can be reached from any other node in a finite number of steps .",
    "for a given kind of networks , once fixed the parameters defining the degree distribution , we considered several network realizations , and for a given network we took randomly the starting nodes for the walks . in each case",
    "considered , the total number of walks amounted to @xmath26 .    in general , for a given length @xmath18 , the number of different saws on a network changes with the starting node .",
    "we will call @xmath27 the average number of saws of length @xmath18 , i.e. the mean value obtained by averaging over the network sites and over different network realizations . for erds - rnyi ( er )",

    "has @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the connective constant can be obtained from the large-@xmath18 limit of the ratio @xmath37 , which in general depends on @xmath18 .",
    "this ratio becomes independent of @xmath18 for random networks when the system size @xmath38 .",
    "this happens because for large @xmath4 the probability of finding loops with @xmath39 in a @xmath18-step walk is negligible , and the self - avoiding condition does not impose in practice any restriction on non - reversal walks .",
