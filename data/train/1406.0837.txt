    "binary fese , with a superconducting transition temperature of 8k , is the simplest of the family of iron - based superconductors , consisting of tetrahedrally co - ordinated fese layers stacked with no spacing atoms @xcite .",
    "its transition temperature can be increased to 14k by substitution of about half of the se atoms with larger te atoms @xcite . in 2010",
    "it was discovered that the introduction of potassium atoms between the fese layers in the crystal structure produced a ternary compound with nominal composition of k@xmath0fe@xmath2se@xmath2 , and significantly increases the superconducting transition temperature to @xmath5 30k @xcite .",
    "subsequently superconductivity has been found in a range of compounds in this family ( a@xmath6fe@xmath1se@xmath2 where a = k , cs , rb , tl , etc . ) .",
    "the compositions of these compounds are well - known to deviate from the ideal stoichiometry @xcite , with fe - vacancies introduced into the structure owing to restrictions on the valency of the iron atom . at least five different types of iron ordering have been found in a@xmath6fe@xmath1se@xmath2 compounds using both bulk techniques such as x - ray and neutron diffraction and high resolution techniques such as tem and stm microscopy , as discussed in a review article by mou et al .",
    "@xcite experimentally determined phase diagrams for rb@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 @xcite and k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 @xcite indicate that antiferromagnetic ( afm ) ordering occurs at temperatures above 500k , with superconductivity co - existing with this afm phase over a narrow range of compositions . compounds with compositions either side of this region are insulating ( or semiconducting ) , exhibiting different forms of afm ordering and vacancy ordering schemes .",
    "there is an ongoing debate about the parent compound of this system .",
    "some suggest it is the insulating @xmath7x@xmath7 ordered fe vacancy phase with composition a@xmath8fe@xmath9se@xmath10 ( known as the `` 245 '' phase ) which exhibits block afm ordering @xcite . in order to obtain the superconducting phase , extra fe",
    "must be added as fe vacancies are considered to be detrimental to superconductivity @xcite .",
    "alternatively there has been speculation that the parent compound is a semiconducting phase ( based on arpes experiments ) @xcite or an @xmath11x@xmath12 ordered fe vacancy phase with composition a@xmath10fe@xmath13se@xmath14 ( based on chemical microanalysis and stm ) @xcite .",
    "sem @xcite , tem @xcite , stm @xcite , nanofocused xrd studies @xcite and snom @xcite have all shown that strong phase separation exists in crystals that exhibit large shielding fractions in magnetisation measurements , and this two phase nature is supported by muon - spin rotation @xcite , mssbauer@xcite , x - ray and neutron diffraction @xcite and nmr @xcite experiments , all indicating that the volume fraction of superconducting phase is small ( @xmath510% ) even in crytals exhibiting 100% magnetic shielding .",
    "the composition of the minority superconducting phase is still under debate . whilst there is consensus about the low concentration of fe vacancies , the alkali metal content is less clear , with nmr results reporting a composition of rb@xmath15fe@xmath10se@xmath10 @xcite whereas refinement of neutron powder diffraction patterns gives rb@xmath16fe@xmath2se@xmath2 @xcite and high quality plan view tem / edx on potassium compounds gives a composition of k@xmath17fe@xmath10se@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "it is generally believed that this minority phase is superconducting , whilst the matrix is the insulating `` 245 '' vacancy ordered phase .",
    "the morphology of the minority phase in cs compounds is shown by cross - sectional hr - sem to consist of a three dimensional network of interconnected plates on the meso - scale @xcite which explains some of the apparently contradictory properties of these compounds , such as high t@xmath18  values and large shielding fractions coupled with large antiferromagnetic volume fractions and high normal state electrical resistivity .",
    "post - growth heat treatments have been found to strongly influence the superconductivity in rb@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2  crystals , with significant improvements to onset t@xmath18  and transition width achieved with annealing and quenching from modest temperatures .",
    "the cooling rate is also found to be crucial to the superconducting properties , with fast cooling from the growth temperature required to achieve high shielding fractions @xcite .",
    "this paper addresses the effects of annealing on microstructural development in the rb@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2  system in order to understand the influence of microstructure on the superconducting and magnetic properties , and to enable optimisation of the growth process .",
    "single crystals of rb@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2  were prepared by bridgman growth using the process described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the as - grown ( ag ) crystal has been cooled from 750k by quenching at a rate of -200k / min .",
    "the crystal was then separated into different fragments in a he glovebox and resealed under vacuum in separate quartz tubes to prevent chemical degradation .",
    "two samples were then annealed for 3 hours at 488k ( a488 ) and 563k ( a563 ) , followed by quenching .",
    "these temperatures were selected as they correspond to the phase separation temperature and a temperature above the ordering temperature respectively @xcite . a wide range of superconducting and magnetic property measurements including magnetisation , transport resistivity and muon spin rotation ( @xmath19sr ) have previously been reported for earlier batches of crystals grown and heat treated under identical conditions @xcite , and structural data from x - ray and neutron diffraction have also been obtained on ag crystals before and after annealing at 100 hours at 488k @xcite . all samples exhibited 100% magnetic shielding in magnetization measurements , and annealing at 488k and quenching resulted in an improvement in the superconducting properties , with slightly increased t@xmath18  values ( of @xmath5 5% ) and significantly decreased transition widths @xcite .",
    "annealing at the higher temperature of 563k was found to be detrimental , reducing the onset t@xmath18  to about 20k .",
    "both @xmath19sr and neutron diffraction confirmed the presence of @xmath510% minority ( superconducting ) phase in the ag crystals .",
    "the crystal structure of the minority phase is found to be compressed along the a - axis and expanded along the c - axis .",
    "however the @xmath19sr results indicate that the volume fraction of superconducting ( non - magnetic ) phase was unchanged upon annealing for 60 hours at 488k , but the non - magnetic phase is found to be distributed on a finer spatial scale after annealing . in contrast , the neutron experiments showed a decrease in the volume fraction of the minority superconducting phase for a crystal annealed at the same temperature for the longer time of 100 hours .",
    "high - resolution electron backscatter diffraction ( hr - ebsd ) experiments were carried out on freshly cleaved ( 001 ) surfaces in a jeol 6500f sem using an edax / tsl digiview ii detector .",
    "this technique is used to map changes in unit cell anisotropy , through cross correlation of electron diffraction patterns and subsequent analysis ( described in @xcite ) .",
    "hr - ebsd can determine relative changes in c and a values , but can not determine absolute c and a values .",
    "therefore the absolute c / a values have been calculated by setting the modal c / a ratio of each map to 3.711 ( based upon xrd measurements @xcite ) .",
    "cross - sectional imaging and serial sectioning were performed on a zeiss nvision fib , with avizo software used for 3d image reconstruction .",
    "a jeol 5510 sem with an oxford instruments x - act edx detector was used for sem and quantitative edx and a zeiss merlin sem with a 150mm@xmath20 oxford instruments x - max detector was used for low voltage sem imaging and high resolution edx .",
    "scanning photoemission microscopy ( spem ) was performed at the spectromicroscopy beamline at elettra synchrotron @xcite using a 74ev photon light source .",
    "figure [ fig : maps ] shows typical hr - ebsd maps from ag , a488 and a563 samples .",
    "the microstructure of the ag sample ( fig .",
    "[ fig : maps ] a ) is very similar to the cs@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2  samples studied previously @xcite , consisting of a square network of linear features oriented along the < 110 >  directions with a larger @xmath3  ratio than the matrix .",
    "the three - dimensional morphology associated with these features can be seen from cross - sectional fib / sem to consist of a network of plates aligned along the \\{113 } habit planes , as previously seen in both the cs and k analogues @xcite .",
    "the plates typically appear discontinuous ( stripey ) as more clearly seen in the 3d reconstruction of the minority phase produced by serial fib polishing in cross - section ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3dfib ] ) .",
    "annealing at the nominal phase separation temperature ( 488k ) results in two main changes to the microstructure ; the separation of the mesoscopic plate features increases from @xmath5 3 @xmath19 m to 5 - 10 @xmath19 m , and the @xmath3  ratio within these features decreases to a value closer to that of the matrix phase .",
    "the mesoscopic features are also less regularly spaced with a larger variability in their @xmath3  values .",
    "the ebsd pattern quality is found to be considerably poorer within the plate - shaped features , probably owing to even finer scale phase separation ( stripes ) within the plates .",
    "this makes it possible to isolate the minority phase by thresholding the maps using the mean angular error ( mae ) parameter from the image correlation procedure ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : maps]d and e ) . whilst it is not possible to obtain an accurate measure of the volume fraction of minority phase from this process as the finer scale phase separation",
    "is not resolved , it is clear that in the ag sample all the plate features have higher @xmath3  ratio than the matrix .",
    "however , in the sample annealed at 488k , some of the plates have higher @xmath3  ratio but others have similar or lower @xmath3  ratio than the matrix , suggesting the presence of at least two different phases in addition to the matrix .",
    "annealing at the higher temperature of 563k , above the fe vacancy ordering temperature of @xmath5 541k , produces a much more homogeneous microstructure on the length scale probed by the hr - ebsd technique ( > 100 nm ) with only small fluctuations of @xmath21@xmath3<0.005 on the length scale of @xmath5 1@xmath19 m and with no sign of the mesoscopic plate - shaped features seen in the ag and a488 samples .",
    "similar matrix fluctuations are observed in the matrix of the a488 samples and are within the noise threshold .",
    "the probability distribution of @xmath3  values for the ag sample shows a skew towards higher @xmath3  values with a shoulder visible on the high @xmath3  side of the peak .",
    "this distribution has been fitted to a two gaussian model , with the majority peak having mean @xmath3=3.711 , @xmath22=0.0046 and the minority peak mean @xmath3=3.721 @xmath22=0.0097 .",
    "this increase in @xmath3  ratio in the minority phase relative to the matrix is considerably smaller than the 3.5% increase found by xrd on similar rb crystals @xcite .",
    "this is believed to be a result of the nano - scale stripey phase separation within the plate - shaped features .",
    "if the volume from which the backscattered electrons originated in the sample is bigger than the secondary phase domains , the ebsd patterns would be a superposition of the patterns for the high @xmath3  phase with the lower @xmath3  matrix , which in practice produces a smearing of the bands on the diffraction pattern , resulting in an intermediate value of @xmath3  being measured .",
    "the gaussian fits for the majority peaks in both the ag and a488 samples have @xmath23 of 0.3% , identical to the neutron scattering data @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3  distribution of the a563 sample is well described by a single gaussian distribution with the smaller standard deviation of 0.0035 , indicating a reduction in the extent of chemical inhomogeneity and/or local mechanical strains in this sample .",
    "the multi - phase microstructures present in the ag and a488 samples have been studied further in the sem using backscattered electron ( bse ) imaging in compositional mode and edx microanalysis ( fig .",
    "[ fig:5510 ] and [ fig : merlin ] ) .",
    "the increase in the length - scale of the mesoscopic plate - shaped features on annealing is immediately apparent in fig .",
    "[ fig:5510 ] , and thresholding the bse image contrast using imagej software gives an areal fraction of the dark contrast phase of approximately 10% in both samples .",
    "if we correlate these plate - shaped features to the superconducting phase , this value is consistent with neutron scattering data @xcite and muon - spin rotation studies @xcite .",
    "the improved spatial resolution relative to the sampling volume used in the hr - ebsd maps shows that the spacing of the fine - scale stripey phase separation within the plates also tends to increase on annealing at 488k . in the ag sample ,",
    "bse images suggest that the mesoscopic plates consist of two phases : one with the same contrast as the matrix and the other appearing darker ( lower average atomic number ) .",
    "interestingly , in contrast to the ag samples , three distinct bse contrasts can be seen in the annealed sample , suggesting the presence of two different minority phases within the matrix , one with darker bse contrast and the other with brighter bse contrast .",
    "quantitative edx at 20kv gave a matrix composition of rb@xmath24fe@xmath25se@xmath10 and rb@xmath24fe@xmath26se@xmath10 for the ag and a488 samples respectively , consistent with the matrix being the afm insulating `` 245 '' phase .",
    "the precise composition of the minor phases can not be measured directly as the interaction volume at 20kv ( required to fully excite the k se line for quantitiative analysis ) is significantly larger than the minority phase domains . however , since the overall composition measured over a large area of the crystal lies on a line between the matrix composition and the measured composition of the minority phase , by estimating the minority phase volume fraction of 10% we find the actual minority phase composition to be approximately rb@xmath17fe@xmath10se@xmath10 , consistent with tem analysis fo minority phases in the potassium compounds @xcite .",
    "the three - phase microstructure of the 488k annealed crystal was further investigated using 5kv accelerating voltage to significantly reduce the edx interaction volume .",
    "figure [ fig : merlin ] clearly shows the plates with dark bse contrast are fe - rich and rb - deficient compared to the matrix as expected . some of the mesoscopic plates consist of two phases as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : merlin](d)-(f ) where one phase appears to be the same composition as the matrix and the other is the fe - rich , rb - deficient phase with dark bse contrast",
    ". however , in other regions there are some plates that have brighter contrast than the matrix and this bright phase is sometimes seen as one of the phases within stripey features as clearly seen in fig . [ fig : merlin](g)-(i ) . by comparing the spectra ( not shown ) from the regions indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : merlin](g ) it can be seen that the bright phase has an intermediate composition , still fe - rich but less rb deficient than the dark phase .",
    "this alkali metal partitioning on the nano - scale has also been reported recently for the k compounds and has been attributed to k - ordering within one of the phases @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the plate - shaped features consist of two phases in the as - grown crystal : the ordered fe vacancy phase with composition close to rb@xmath8fe@xmath9se@xmath2 and the `` vacancy - free '' superconducting rb@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2  phase with y@xmath50 and increased @xmath3  ratio relative to the matrix . in the annealed crystals there are at least two different minority phases present in addition to the matrix : the dark contrast vacancy - free phase ( probably with increased @xmath3  ratio ) and a bright contrast phase that is also fe - rich but less rb deficient than the dark vacancy free phase that may be the lower @xmath3  ratio phase seen in the hr - ebsd map .",
    "it is interesting to note that haadf stem analysis on k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2  crystals has also identified another phase within the fe - rich plates which has a lower c - axis lattice parameter and containing very fine scale low atomic number features in the ( 001 ) plane that may be cracks formed to relieve residual stress in the multiphase system .",
    "these very fine scale features have also been observed by other researchers @xcite .      in order to understand the effects of heat treatments on the superconducting and magnetic properties ,",
    "it is beneficial to discuss the thermodynamic and kinetic factors affecting the complex microstructural development in this system .",
    "previously reported dsc measurements on earlier batches of rb@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2  crystals @xcite show peaks corresponding to the onset of the ordering of fe vacancies at t@xmath27 540k , the afm neel temperature t@xmath28 517k and a third peak attributed to the phase separation into the ordered vacancy phase plus the vacancy - free phase at t@xmath29 488k .",
    "the growth process involves cooling crystals at a moderate rate from the disordered fe vacancy phase at high temperature .",
    "on cooling through t@xmath30 , the ordered fe vacancy phase forms , probably by a nucleation and growth process , rejecting excess fe ahead of the growth interface .",
    "wang et al . suggest from their in - situ tem studies that the fe - vacancy ordering occurs by a spinodal mechanism , but no conclusive evidence for this has been presented .",
    "the length scale of the ordered domains are very large for spinodal microstructures , especially at low temperatures , and the interfaces between the domains appear abrupt which is more indicative of a nucleation and growth process than spinodal decomposition .",
    "the enriched fe domains that remain between the ordered vacancy phase domains eventually decompose into two ( or more ) phases at t@xmath31 producing the fine stripey appearance clearly seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : merlin](d ) and ( g ) .",
    "it is possible that there are a number of binary eutectoid reactions in system and slight fluctuations in the composition of the un - transformed fe - rich phase result in different volume fractions of the three phases being produced on cooling .",
    "the scale of the mesoscopic plate - like microstructure is governed by the rate of diffusion that can occur below t@xmath30 during processing .",
    "the moderately fast cooling in the as - grown crystal results , as expected , in smaller scale plate separation than the samples annealed at temperatures below t@xmath30 ( e.g. 488k ) in which coarsening of the mesoscopic fe - rich plates occurs .",
    "after annealing , the quench is expected to be faster than the as - grown cooling rate , as the size of the fragments of the crystals annealed is considerably smaller than the initial crystals .",
    "this explains why the sample annealed at 563k ( above t@xmath30 ) has a microstructure that is too fine to be seen in the hr - ebsd .",
    "the sample annealed at 488k has slightly coarser phase separation within the plates than the ag sample , suggesting that the annealing temperature is slightly below t@xmath31 .",
    "however , the muon spin rotation data on a crystal prepared under similar annealing conditions finds a reduced size of the paramagnetic ( superconducting ) domains . in this case",
    "it is likely that the annealing temperature is slightly above t@xmath31 and the fine scale microstructure is produced on quenching through t@xmath31 .",
    "very small differences in crystal composition or furnace temperature could be responsible for the differences between the sample studied here and the one used in the muon spin rotation experiment .",
    "it remains to explore the reason why annealing at 488k improves t@xmath32 of the superconducting phase .",
    "one possibility is that the chemistry and resulting structural parameters of the superconducting phase change slightly as a result of the annealing and quenching procedure .",
    "this could result from local equilibriation of the composition of the fe - rich phase above t@xmath31 , different cooling rate affecting the composition and/or strain in the superconducting phase .",
    "alternatively it could be the finer scale of the phase separation within the mesoscopic plates that is responsible for the improved superconducting properties , with suggestions that superconductivity in this system is strongly influenced by the surrounding afm matrix phase , with proximity effects enhancing t@xmath32 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the finer scale microstructures within the plates seen in muon - spin studies on crystals annealed at 488k @xcite might be responsible for the improved properties",
    ".    to investigate the electronic properties of the different phases , scanning photoemission microscopy ( spem ) has been performed using the spectromicroscopy beamline at elettra .",
    "figure [ fig : spectromicroscopy ] compares an as - grown crystal ( ag-2 ) with one annealed at 488k for 3 hours ( a488 - 2 ) .",
    "these samples are from a different growth run than the crystals studied above , but they have been prepared under the same conditions .",
    "the maps in figure [ fig : spectromicroscopy ] ( a ) and ( d ) show the spatial variation in the intensity of photoelectrons emitted within the energy window between 71 and 69.7 ev ( corresponding to low binding energies up to -1.15ev relative to the fermi level at 70.85 ev ) for the ag-2 and a488 - 2 samples respectively .",
    "the mesoscopic plate - like microstructure is clearly visible as bright features in these near - fermi - level maps , with the scale of the microstructure being larger for the annealed sample as observed in the sem .",
    "the lateral dimensions of these mesoscopic plate features appears to be larger in the spem images than in the sem , possibly because spem is a much more surface sensitive technique .",
    "the fine - scale phase separation within the plates is not typically resolved in the spem images which may be a result of the inherent lower lateral spatial resolution ( above 0.6@xmath19 m ) , or it may be an indication that the electronic structure in the matrix is modified in the vicinity of the secondary phase . the survey spectra in [ fig : spectromicroscopy ] ( b ) and ( e ) show that the main difference between the bright and dark regions in the maps is the intensity of the lowest binding energy peaks which are known from dft modelling to be mainly associated with fe 3d orbitals @xcite .",
    "the more detailed valence band spectra in figures [ fig : spectromicroscopy ] ( c ) and ( f ) reveal that the low binding energy feature consists of at least two distinct peaks , with the intensity of the peak just below the fermi level substantially higher in the plate features relative to the matrix phase . comparing",
    "the spectra from bright regions in the ag and a488 samples shows that the increased contrast seen in the a488 image results from a significant enhancement in the lowest binding energy peak .",
    "using classical arpes chen et al . found that this peak originates from the superconducting phase in k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2  samples @xcite , providing direct evidence that the bright plate - like features seen in our spem images are the phase that becomes superconducting at lower temperatures , with the dark matrix phase having insulating properties .",
    "a simple argument based on the relative number of valence electrons per unit cell in the vacancy - ordered rb@xmath8fe@xmath9se@xmath10 phase ( 25.6 e per formula unit ) and the vacancy - free composition rb@xmath17fe@xmath10se@xmath10 phase ( 28.5 e per formula unit ) suggests that the higher fe content in the vacancy free phase leads to increased occupation of the upper fe 3d orbitals leading to metallic / superconducting properties .",
    "more detailed analysis of the spem results will be the topic of a future publication .",
    "the @xmath4 habit planes of the facetted minority phase domains can be understood through the stress - free transformation strain required to create them from the parent phase . assuming a coherent interface , this is given by @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the lattice parameters of the parent and minority phases respectively . according to the khachaturyan - shaltov microelasticity theory",
    ", the precipitates will form facets with normal vectors @xmath35 that minimize the following energy function : @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( see shi _ et al_@xcite )",
    ". taking the elastic moduli calculated for a similar compound @xcite , and the lattice parameters observed at the phase separation temperature @xcite , gives the energy function @xmath39 shown in figure [ fig : elasticity ] .",
    "the left pane shows the full three - dimensional energy surface , and the centre pane shows its projection onto the @xmath40 plane for ease of comparison with figure [ fig:3dfib ] .",
    "this clearly shows that the directions corresponding to the minimum @xmath41 values are at an angle of 30@xmath42 to [ 110 ] direction , along the @xmath4 plane normal directions .",
    "this explains that the facetting we observe on the @xmath4 planes as shown in the right pane of figure [ fig : elasticity ] arises as a result of minimising the volume strain energy associated with the transformation .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated spatial variations in crystal structure , chemistry and electronic structure in rb@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2  crystals subjected to three different thermal treatments using hr - ebsd , sem microanalysis and spem . by combining our microstructural results with earlier structural and magnetic / superconducting measurements",
    ", we have developed an explanation of the phase transformations occuring in this system which is in agreement with the physical properties .",
    "the mesoscopic plate - shaped features are believed to develop upon fe vacancy ordering , originating from the residual high fe content disordered vacancy phase left between the facetted domains of the ordered phase .",
    "we have shown that the observed facetting on the @xmath4 planes can be explained from calculations of the elastic strain energy associated with the transformation .",
    "the metastable microstructures formed during moderately fast cooling from high temperatures can be modified substantially by subsequent annealing and quenching .",
    "the hr - ebsd technique can not image the nanoscale phase separation in these crystals , but the pattern quality deterioration in the mesoscopic features is indicative of the presence of multiple phases at the nanoscale .",
    "the spem results are consistent with the minority high fe - content , high @xmath3  phase being superconducting and the lower @xmath3  matrix having insulating properties . further microstrucural studies using higher spatial resolution techniques such as ( s)tem with vacuum transfer capability to avoid reaction with air are necessary for quantitative characterisation of the nano - scale phase separation in these materials .",

    "<S> the superconducting and magnetic properties of phase - separated a@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 compounds are known to depend on post - growth heat treatments and cooling profiles . </S>",
    "<S> this paper focusses on the evolution of microstructure on annealing , and how this influences the superconducting properties of rb@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2  single crystals . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the minority phase in the as - grown crystal has increased unit cell anisotropy ( @xmath3  ratio ) , reduced rb content and increased fe content compared to the matrix . </S>",
    "<S> the microstructure is rather complex , with two - phase mesoscopic plate - shaped features aligned along @xmath4 habit planes . </S>",
    "<S> the minority phase are strongly facetted on the @xmath4 planes , which we have shown to be driven by minimising the volume strain energy introduced as a result of the phase transformation . </S>",
    "<S> annealing at 488k results in coarsening of the mesoscopic plate - shaped features and the formation of a third distinct phase . </S>",
    "<S> the subtle differences in structure and chemistry of the minority phase(s ) in the crystals are thought to be responsible for changes in the superconducting transition temperature . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , scanning photoemission microscopy has clearly shown that the electronic structure of the minority phase has a higher occupied density of states of the low binding energy fe3d orbitals , characteristic of crystals that exhibit superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> this demonstrates a clear correlation between the fe - vacancy - free phase with high @xmath3  ratio and the electronic structure characteristics of the superconducting phase . </S>"
