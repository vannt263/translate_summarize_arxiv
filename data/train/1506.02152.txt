    "lattice codes for gaussian channels have received a lot of attention in the recent past . they have been shown to achieve the capacity of the power - constrained awgn channel  @xcite , and have been used with great success for physical layer network coding for gaussian networks  @xcite .",
    "they have also been used to design coding schemes for secure and reliable communication over the gaussian wiretap channel  @xcite and the bidirectional relay  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we study secure bidirectional relaying , where two users @xmath0 and @xmath1 want to exchange messages via an `` honest - but - curious '' relay @xmath2 .",
    "the relay acts as a passive eavesdropper , but otherwise conforms to the protocol which it is asked to follow , i.e. , it does not modify or tamper with the message it has to forward .",
    "we also assume that there is no direct link between the user nodes , and all communication between @xmath0 and @xmath1 must happen via @xmath2 .",
    "we use the two - phase compute - and - forward protocol  @xcite for bidirectional relaying , which we briefly describe here .",
    "let @xmath3 be a prime number and @xmath4 be a positive integer .",
    "user nodes @xmath0 and @xmath1 have messages @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively , which are assumed to be uniformly distributed over @xmath7 , where @xmath8 denotes the finite field with @xmath3 elements .",
    "let @xmath9 denote the addition operation in @xmath7 .",
    "in the first phase , also called the _ multiple access channel ( mac ) phase _ , the messages are mapped to @xmath10-dimensional real - valued codewords @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively , and transmitted simultaneously to @xmath2 , who receives @xmath13 here @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) with variance @xmath16 .",
    "the relay computes an integer - linear combination of the messages , @xmath17 , and forwards this to the user nodes in an ensuing _ broadcast phase_. if @xmath3 does not divide @xmath18 ( resp .",
    "@xmath19 ) , then @xmath0 ( resp .",
    "@xmath1 ) can recover @xmath6 ( resp .",
    "@xmath5 ) . in this paper",
    ", we will be concerned only with the mac phase , i.e. , we only want to ensure that the relay can compute the integer - linear combination @xmath17 .",
    "in fact , by restricting ourselves to the mac phase , we can consider the more general problem where the messages @xmath5 and @xmath6 are uniformly distributed over a finite abelian group @xmath20 , with @xmath9 denoting addition in @xmath20 , and the relay must be able to compute an integer - linear combination @xmath17 . here , we use the notation @xmath21 to denote the sum of @xmath5 with itself @xmath22 times , i.e. , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and so on .",
    "likewise , @xmath25 denotes the sum of @xmath6 with itself @xmath26 times .",
    "all our results will hold for this general case where @xmath2 wants to compute @xmath17 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are uniformly distributed over a finite abelian group @xmath20 .",
    "we impose the additional constraint that @xmath2 must not get any information about the individual messages . specifically , we address the problem under two measures of security :    * _ perfect secrecy : _ the received vector is independent of the individual messages , i.e. , @xmath27 and @xmath28 . * _ strong secrecy : _ the information leaked by @xmath29 about the individual messages must be vanishingly small for large @xmath10 , i.e. , @xmath30    the secure bidirectional relaying problem was first studied in  @xcite and subsequently in  @xcite , where the authors gave a strongly - secure scheme for the case @xmath31 using lattice codes and randomization using universal hash functions .",
    "this was later studied by  @xcite , who gave a coding scheme ( also for @xmath31 ) for secrecy using nested lattice codes and randomization using probability mass functions ( pmfs ) obtained by sampling well - chosen probability density functions ( pdfs ) .",
    "it was shown that using a pmf obtained by sampling the gaussian density , strong secrecy can be obtained ( a technique that was first used for the gaussian wiretap channel in  @xcite ) .",
    "it was also shown in  @xcite that by choosing a density function having a compactly supported characteristic function , even perfect secrecy can be achieved .    in this paper , we extend the results of  @xcite , and make an attempt to study the robustness of the schemes presented there . in a practical scenario , the user nodes may not know @xmath32 and @xmath33 exactly , since there is always an error in estimation of the channel gains . in this paper , we assume that the user nodes _ do not know _ the values of the channel gains @xmath32 and @xmath33 . however , the relay is assumed to know @xmath32 and @xmath33 exactly .",
    "we want to know if it is still possible to achieve security in this situation .",
    "we split the analysis into two parts : ( 1 ) the case when @xmath34 is irrational , and ( 2 ) when @xmath34 is rational .",
    "we will see that no lattice - based coding scheme can guarantee secrecy in case ( 1 ) , and find sufficient conditions to guarantee perfect / strong security in the latter case .",
    "if @xmath34 is rational , then we can express @xmath35 and @xmath36 for some real number @xmath37 and co - prime integers @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , in the first few sections , we will assume that the channel gains @xmath32 and @xmath33 are _ co - prime integers , but are unknown _ to both users , and that @xmath40 .",
    "we want to ensure that the relay can securely compute @xmath17 . in the specific case of the bidirectional relay problem",
    ", we can choose @xmath41 to ensure that the user nodes can recover the desired messages from @xmath17 .",
    "note that if @xmath20 is an arbitrary finite abelian group , then it is not guaranteed that one can recover @xmath5 ( resp .",
    "@xmath6 ) given @xmath6 ( resp .",
    "@xmath5 ) and @xmath17 .",
    "the relay also needs to forward @xmath42 to the users in the broadcast phase to ensure message recovery , since the users have no knowledge of the channel gains prior to the broadcast phase .",
    "we will mostly study the noiseless scenario , i.e. , the relay receives @xmath43 , and find conditions under which our scheme achieves security .",
    "the problem therefore is to ensure secure computation of @xmath17 from @xmath44 .",
    "we can see that if the order of @xmath5 divides @xmath19 , then @xmath45 is simply @xmath25 , and confidentiality of the message @xmath6 is lost .",
    "we will therefore make the assumption that the _ order of no element of _",
    "@xmath20 divides @xmath19 or @xmath18 .",
    "we will also briefly discuss achievable rates in presence of gaussian noise , but without any proofs .",
    "we remark that demanding security in the noiseless scenario is a much stronger condition .",
    "since the additive noise @xmath15 is independent of everything else , @xmath46 forms a markov chain , and hence , @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , any scheme that achieves perfect / strong secrecy in the noiseless setting also continues to achieve the same in presence of noise .",
    "furthermore , such a scheme has the added advantage that security is achieved _ irrespective of the distribution _ on @xmath15 , and even when this distribution is _ unknown _ to the users .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the coding scheme is described in section  [ sec : codingscheme ] .",
    "we discuss perfect secrecy in section  [ sec : perfectsec ] , and theorem  [ thm : perfect_asymmetric ] gives sufficient conditions for achieving perfect security with integral channel gains .",
    "strong secrecy is studied in section  [ sec : strongsec ] , and theorem  [ thm : strongsec_asymmetric ] gives sufficient conditions for achieving strong secrecy with integral channel gains . in section  [ sec : discussion ] , we discuss the case where the channel gains are not integral and co - prime , and conclude with some final remarks .",
    "we use the notation followed in  @xcite . for the basic definitions and results related to lattices , see , e.g. ,  @xcite . given a lattice @xmath48 , the fundamental voronoi region",
    "is denoted by @xmath49 .",

    "then , it is easy to show that perfectly ( resp .",
    "strongly ) secure computation of @xmath17 can be performed at the relay as long as the order of no nonzero element of @xmath63 divides @xmath19 or @xmath18 , and @xmath315 @xmath316 .",
    "furthermore , the achievable rate is given by @xmath317 @xmath318 .",
    "consider any @xmath322 that satisfy @xmath323 .",
    "if @xmath324 is a ( full - rank ) generator matrix of @xmath48 , then we can write @xmath325 , @xmath326 , @xmath327 , and @xmath328 , where @xmath329 and @xmath330 belong to @xmath331 .",
    "therefore , @xmath332 . for @xmath333 , and @xmath334 , let @xmath335 and @xmath336 denote the @xmath337th components of @xmath338 and @xmath339 respectively .",
    "now suppose that @xmath340 .",
    "then , there exists some @xmath341 such that @xmath342 . rearranging @xmath343 , we get @xmath344 however , the right hand side is clearly a rational number , which contradicts our hypothesis of @xmath34 being irrational .",
    "therefore , @xmath345 .",
    "similarly , @xmath346 .    for our lattice - based scheme to achieve perfect / strong secrecy",
    "it is therefore necessary that @xmath34 be rational , in which case we can write @xmath312 and @xmath313 for some @xmath347 and co - prime integers @xmath19 and @xmath18 .",
    "in addition to this , no element of @xmath63 can have its order dividing @xmath19 or @xmath18 if we want to achieve security .",
    "while we have seen that the second requirement is sufficient to guarantee perfect / strong secrecy , we also claim that it is also a _ necessary _ condition for perfect secrecy . to see why this is the case ,",
    "recall that we want @xmath348 for all @xmath349 . for this",
    ", the supports of the two pmfs must be the same . while the support of @xmath350 is @xmath351 , the support of @xmath352 is @xmath353 ( since @xmath354 ) .",
    "we can write @xmath355 .",
    "if the order of some element of @xmath63 divides @xmath18 , then we can argue using the pigeon hole principle that @xmath356 , and hence , perfect secrecy is not obtained .",
    "this justifies our claim .",
    "the requirement of @xmath34 being rational to obtain security may appear discouraging for a practical scenario , where the channel gains are almost surely irrational .",
    "however , we must note that we have used a rather pessimistic model for the system . in practice",
    ", the user nodes do have a rough estimate of the channel gains , and the channel is noisy . while it may not be possible to achieve perfect security even in presence of noise when the channel gains are irrational unknown to the user nodes , we may hope to achieve strong secrecy .",
    "we observed that if we proceed along the lines of lemma  [ lemma : vdistance_bound ] , strong secrecy can be achieved if the flatness factors @xmath357 for @xmath358 . to achieve this",
    ", we could use a secrecy - good lattice scaled so that @xmath359 for @xmath358 .",
    "however , it turns out that this is in conflict with the requirement of reliable decoding of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , for which we need @xmath360 to be greater than @xmath361 .",
    "hence , it seems that a different approach is required to tackle this problem .    before concluding the paper",
    ", we make a final remark .",
    "although the scheme presented in section  [ sec : codingscheme ] may not be optimal if the channel gains are not known exactly at the user nodes , we demonstrate that there is a scheme with which security can be obtained in such a scenario",
    ".      we can use the following four - stage amplify - and - forward bidirectional relaying strategy : in the first phase , user @xmath0 transmits its codeword @xmath362 , which is jammed by a gaussian random vector @xmath363 generated by @xmath1 .",
    "the relay simply scales the received vector and sends it to @xmath1 , who knows @xmath363 and can recover @xmath362 .",
    "the channel from @xmath0 to @xmath1 can be modeled as a gaussian wiretap channel , where @xmath2 acts as the eavesdropper . using a wiretap code  @xcite for @xmath11",
    ", we can achieve strong secrecy .",
    "user @xmath1 similarly uses a wiretap code to transmit its message to user @xmath0 via @xmath2 in the third and fourth phases .",
    "a reasonable assumption to make is that the error in the estimation of @xmath32 and @xmath33 at both user nodes is at most @xmath364 . to keep things simple ,",
    "let us assume that @xmath2 simply forwards the received signal to the users without scaling . at the end of the second phase",
    ", @xmath1 receives @xmath365 , where @xmath366 is the sum of the noise vectors accumulated in the first two phases , and has variance @xmath367 .",
    "suppose that the estimates of @xmath42 made by @xmath1 are @xmath368 and @xmath369 respectively .",
    "due to the error in estimation , there would be a residual component of @xmath12 remaining even after the jamming signal has been removed .",
    "therefore , @xmath1 `` sees '' an effective channel of @xmath370 , where the effective noise is @xmath371 . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath2 `` sees '' the effective channel @xmath372 , where @xmath373 .",
    "it can be shown that  @xcite using the lattice gaussian distribution for randomization , i.e. , @xmath374 given by ( [ eq : pu_x ] ) with @xmath98 , a rate of @xmath375 can be achieved by @xmath0 with strong secrecy .",
    "in fact , the rate can be slightly improved by using a modulo - and - forward scheme  @xcite instead of the simple amplify - and - forward scheme for relaying ."
