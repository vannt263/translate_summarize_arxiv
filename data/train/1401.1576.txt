    "in the numerical analysis of elliptic pdes , much attention has been given ( quite rightly ) to the discretization of the second - order laplace operator .",
    "the development of mixed finite elements ( e.g. , edge elements ) paved the way for the discretization of other laplace - type second - order differential operators , such as the vector laplacian , with important numerical applications in computational electromagnetics and elasticity .",
    "the recent development of _ finite element exterior calculus _ ( @xcite ) has shown that these operators are special cases of the _ hodge  laplace operator _ on differential @xmath0-forms , which can be stably discretized by certain families of finite element differential forms .",
    "an even more general operator , called the _ abstract hodge  laplace operator _ , includes both the aforementioned hodge",
    " laplace operator on @xmath0-forms , as well as other operators that arise , for example , in elasticity .    by comparison ,",
    "_ dirac - type operators _ have received little attention from the perspective of numerical pdes  despite being , in many ways , just as fundamental as the widely - studied laplace operators discussed above .",
    "informally , a dirac operator is a square root of some laplace operator , and is therefore a _ first - order _ ( rather than second - order ) differential operator .",
    "dirac - type operators arise both in analysis ( @xcite ) and in differential geometry ( @xcite ) , in addition to their well - known , eponymous origins in quantum mechanics ( @xcite ) .",
    "the study of these first - order operators is also associated with a number of celebrated theorems , including the atiyah ",
    "singer index theorem @xcite , witten s proof of the positive energy theorem @xcite , and the solution of the kato square root problem ( @xcite ) .",
    "_ clifford analysis _",
    "is the study of dirac operators in various settings , including on smooth manifolds ( @xcite ) .",
    "recently , there has been growing interest in developing a theory of _ discrete clifford analysis _ , based on lattice discretizations of dirac operators ( @xcite ) . in many respects ,",
    "this work resembles the various lattice approaches to discretizing exterior calculus ( @xcite ) , particularly in the use of primal - dual mesh pairs .",
    "these approaches are closer in spirit to finite difference methods than to finite element methods , in that they focus more on the degrees of freedom themselves than on basis functions and interpolants . consequently",
    ", these methods tend to be less amenable to stability and convergence analysis , or to higher - order discretizations , compared with the finite element exterior calculus of @xcite .",
    "however , scant attention has been given to the possibility of using a mixed finite element approach to discretize dirac - type operators and their associated first - order pdes .",
    "the present paper aims to fill this gap .",
    "the paper is organized as follows :    1 .   in the remainder of this section ,",
    "we briefly provide some background on the relationship between exterior calculus and clifford analysis , which we illustrate with examples on @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    ", we develop an abstract version of hodge theory and the hodge  dirac operator , and prove well - posedness for the associated variational problem .",
    "following @xcite , this approach replaces the exterior derivative by an arbitrary nilpotent operator on a hilbert space . despite the simplicity of this setup  even simpler than the hilbert complexes considered by @xcite and @xcite  it retains all of the salient features needed for the analysis , including abstract versions of the hodge decomposition and poincar inequality .",
    ", we consider the discretization of the variational problem for the abstract hodge  dirac operator , proving stability and _ a priori _ error estimates .",
    "moreover , given some additional assumptions on the nilpotent operator , we develop improved estimates based on a duality/@xmath3-lifting / aubin  nitsche - type argument .",
    ", we relate the abstract hodge  dirac operator to its square , the abstract hodge  laplace operator , and show that some of the key results of finite element exterior calculus ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) are recovered as corollaries of the estimates in and .",
    ", we briefly discuss the correspondence between the nilpotent operator formalism , considered here , and the hilbert complex formalism used by @xcite .",
    "in particular , this correspondence implies that the elements used in finite element exterior calculus , e.g. , the @xmath4 and @xmath5 families of piecewise - polynomial differential forms on simplicial meshes and the @xmath6 family on cubical meshes ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , also yield a stable discretization of the hodge  dirac problem .",
    "finally , in , we provide a numerical application for the discretization of the hodge  dirac operator : computing a vector field with prescribed divergence and curl .      in this section ,",
    "we illustrate the relationship between the euclidean hodge  dirac operator for differential forms and certain dirac operators for clifford algebra - valued functions . in particular , we focus on the important examples of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , where the clifford algebra ( or its even subalgebra ) can be identified with the complex numbers @xmath9 or the quaternions @xmath10 .",

    "these observations have direct analogs in the language of clifford analysis .",
    "the clifford algebra @xmath41 on @xmath1 has elements of the form @xmath42 subject to the algebraic relations @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "this is isomorphic to the algebra of quaternions @xmath10 , while the even subalgebra @xmath45 , containing only even - degree terms @xmath46 , is isomorphic to @xmath47 by taking @xmath48 .",
    "hence , @xmath18 can be identified with @xmath49-valued ( i.e. , quaternion - valued ) functions on @xmath1 , by mapping @xmath50 . likewise , @xmath51 can be identified with @xmath52-valued ( i.e. , complex - valued ) functions on @xmath1 .",
