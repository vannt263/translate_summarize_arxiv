    "the density of neutron resonances @xmath5 is one of the main results of analysis of the data of all experiments performed using the neutron time - of - flight method .",
    "it is the basis point for any experiments where nucleus level density is derived from the spectra of gamma - quanta or evaporation nucleons .",
    "high precision in determination of @xmath6 is stipulated by excellent resolution of corresponding method , but it can be realized only by careful accounting or correction of all systematical errors of experiment .    the most serious and not removable from them is  omission \" of resonances whose reduced neutron width @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ... ) is less than the sensitivity threshold of experiment . in principle ,",
    "determination of the most probable value of @xmath6 in this situation is possible only by means of the most precise approximation of distribution of @xmath7 in all region of their values and extrapolation of the obtained function into the region below threshold .",
    "of course , precision of this procedure is determined by degree of correspondence of theoretical notions about distribution @xmath7 to experiment .    according to theoretical analysis @xcite",
    ", the value @xmath7 in nuclei of intermediate and large mass is determined by few - quasi - particle components of wave function whose square contribution in its normalization is estimated by value of about @xmath9-@xmath10 .",
    "their small and chaotic values for different resonances are determined by strong fragmentation @xcite of low - lying one- and two - quasi - particle states of a nucleus .",
    "there is the first necessary condition for description of fluctuations of @xmath7 by the porter - thomas distribution @xcite .",
    "another condition is that the mathematics expectation of mean value of amplitude @xmath11 must be equal to zero , and its dispersion  to mean @xmath2 . both conditions : @xmath12 are not tested in modern analysis of the experimental @xmath7 values @xcite .",
    "i.e. , applicability of the porter - thomas distribution is postulated but is not proved .",
    "the experimental width distribution is not tested also for possibility of existence of superposition of several distributions with different values @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "approximation @xcite of level density derived from the two - step cascade intensities shows that the structure of any nucleus changes cyclically as increasing excitation energy .",
    "this fact is determined so far as at present there is the only methodically model - free method for determination of @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "this occurs , at least , due to excitation of nucleus states with increasing number of quasi - particles and , probably , due to variation of number and type of phonons .",
    "fragmentation of these complicating nucleus states inevitably changes coefficients of wave functions of neutron resonances ( as it follows from basis notions of quasi - particle - phonon model of nucleus ) . as a result",
    ", it is possible violation of the porter - thomas distribution in existing today interpretation ( 1 ) .",
    "the method for analysis of the data on @xmath7 accounting for these factors is described in @xcite , concrete results of the best fitting of the experimental data for actinides are given in @xcite .",
    "cumulative sum of @xmath7 in suggested there analysis is approximated by one or several distributions of the variables : @xmath16 with the initial values of fitted parameters @xmath17    parameters of the best approximation of distribution of the experimental values of @xmath7 in actinides for variants of their one ( @xmath18 ) or , maximum , four ( @xmath19 ) distributions with different @xmath20 and @xmath3 are compared in @xcite between themselves or with approximation of the distorted by given registration threshold pure model random values .",
    "this analysis brings to the conclusion that at present it is inadmissibly to exclude a possibility of existence of superposition of several differing by parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 width distributions in every nucleus .",
    "although unambiguous conclusion about its presence can not be made on the basis of the modern experimental data on the resonance neutron widths . therefore , the mean spacing between resonances in actinides is determined below in different ( @xmath23 and @xmath19 ) variants .",
    "the suggested in @xcite possibility to estimate the most probable number of omitted resonances in any experiment calls no doubts if only the functional dependence of their part @xmath24 from the total number @xmath4 was set on the grounds of some data for concrete intervals of resonance energies .",
    "then the parameters of unknown distributions are determined by equation : @xmath25    here @xmath26 for gamma - function @xmath27 with variable @xmath28 .",
    "the value @xmath29 is determined only by difference @xmath30 for the varied expected resonance @xmath31 number in interval @xmath32 and the obtained experimentally @xmath33 .",
    "the number of these intervals practically was varied from 5 to 20 in dependence on quantity of experimental values of widths . moreover , negative values @xmath30 in all cases were changed by zero .",
    "the calculated and experimental cumulative sums in this equation have differing values of variables : function @xmath4 was obtained under assumption that the unknown mean value of neutron width corresponds to @xmath34 , but the mean neutron width for the calculated value is determined by sum @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , calculation of @xmath36 is carried out after corresponding change in variable @xmath28 for difference @xmath37 .",
    "the serious enough problem is setting of dispersion of cumulative sum for arbitrary value @xmath28 .",
    "methodically this problem has simple solution : there are generated large sets of cumulative sums of squares of normally distributed numbers with given @xmath21 and @xmath22 values for each  partial \" function number @xmath38 and for them by means of usual relations of mathematical statistics is determined function @xmath39 for each magnitude of variable @xmath28 .",
    "but , in practice , this procedure requires unacceptable expenditures of computer time .",
    "that is why , possible change of the @xmath36 value for different densities of neutron resonances for realistic values of dispersions of cumulative sums was performed only for @xmath40th , @xmath41u and @xmath42pu ( only in approach of validity of the porter - thomas distribution ) .",
    "the difference of principle between the results of this approximation and the data given below was not revealed .",
    "function ( 4 ) has not real minimum and in this variant of analysis of distributions of reduced neutron widths .",
    "comparison between the calculated and experimental cumulative sums shows that some small difference of @xmath36 for tested @xmath43 values is mainly caused by strong fluctuations of cumulative sums in region of the largest @xmath28 values .",
    "naturally , function @xmath44 can take into account and other factors distorting experimental distribution of widths .",
    "this accounting can be performed in frameworks of both some model approaches and concrete experimental data .",
    "of course , function @xmath44 can not be set unambiguously for the majority of factors which distort the neutron widths distributions .",
    "the desired @xmath45 value corresponds to minimum of @xmath36 for varied values @xmath3 .",
    "fluctuations of different strength in the found function @xmath46 are connected with ambiguity of the best fit in the region of the large @xmath28 values or change in parameters for elements of the tested superposition at @xmath47 . in particular , at change of @xmath3 in case @xmath23 , for example , the smaller values of @xmath36 can be really realized not for two , but in fact  three distributions : sum of widths distributions for both spin values of resonances and additional distribution of widths corresponding to the largest values of @xmath7 and parameter @xmath48 .",
    "1 . experimental number of resonances in interval @xmath49 ev for @xmath50u .",
    "the example of concrete dependence of @xmath33 is shown in fig .",
    "the parameter of analysis ( 4 ) for this nucleus was tested for interval @xmath51 .",
    "comparison of experimental cumulative sum of widths in @xmath50u corresponding to different expected density of neutron resonances for @xmath52 and @xmath53 ev with the best approximation by expression ( 4 ) is presented in fig .",
    "2 .    fig .",
    "typical forms of the best approximations of cumulative sums for the experimental data on the reduced neutron widths . as an example",
    ", there are presented the data for @xmath19 @xmath50u in region of strong increase of @xmath36 and region of its practically constant value .    in this nucleus , as in all investigated here nuclei , is observed typical result : for @xmath54 ( odd ) or @xmath55 ev ( even - even targets ) is achieved the best and practically the same degree of correspondence of the experiment and model approximation .",
    "any values of @xmath21 and @xmath22 at noticeably smaller values @xmath3 can not give small @xmath36 by use of superposition of both two and four different distributions .",
    "however , the values @xmath36 for @xmath23 , respectively , increase with respect to @xmath19 .",
    "sometimes  very essentially .    besides",
    ", it should be taken into account that the practical search of parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 , which guarantees minimum of @xmath36 in the used method of approximation can not secure the best approximation of the experimental data in arbitrary variant of calculation .",
    "only the repeated variation of initial values and ways of random processes can provide the sufficient for practical applications precision of determination of the lowest possible @xmath36 value .",
    "the obtained by us distributions @xmath46 for different variants of approximation of the experimental data for nuclei from the mass region @xmath56 are given in figures 3 - 4 .",
    "estimated values of widths were taken from library endf / b - vii @xcite . in order to compensate  omitted \" resonances in @xmath40th and @xmath57u , the authors of the neutron resonance evaluation included for these nuclei in the library data the resonances whose random widths are less than registration threshold .",
    "naturally , presented here analysis of such mixture may gives somewhat distorted information on density of neutron resonances and is added below , most probably , for demonstration of potential of the suggested method .",
    "results of fitting of the @xmath3 value , as it is seen from the data presented in figures 3 - 4 for each nucleus , depend on model notions . in practice , one can conclude that :    \\(a ) the analysis gives wide spectrum of possible @xmath3 values corresponding to either practically constant @xmath36 value or  weakly fluctuating function of this parameter ;    \\(b ) weak local minima of @xmath36 are caused by bad stipulation of approximation process for variant @xmath58 distributions .    in both cases",
    "the number of fitted parameters is many times less than the number of analyzed resonances .",
    "therefore , the data for four distributions can be adopted as the most probable ones .",
    "3 . the @xmath36 value for the tested @xmath3 parameter for the nuclei with mass @xmath59 .",
    "the experimental sum of widths is approximated by two ( open ) or four ( full circles ) distributions with corresponding magnitudes of variable ( 2 ) .",
    "the arrows correspond to @xmath3 values from [ 11 ] or [ 10 ] .",
    "the same , as in fig .",
    "3 , for nuclei with mass @xmath60 .",
    "the most important result obtained in frameworks of described analysis of the experimental data on values of @xmath61 or @xmath62  the mean @xmath63 and @xmath15 values are at present determined with on principle unknown systematical error .",
    "really this result is expected : parameters of any process under study can not be found even from mathematically strong extrapolation ( or interpolation ) of corresponding data ( in given case  for the studied regions of nucleus excitation energy ) .",
    "the unexpected point was the found here possibility that the mean value of widths can be much less than registration threshold of experiment .    in original paper @xcite",
    "is stated without any proof that :  as a consequence of experimental limitations , levels with small widths may escape detection , and also there may be only few of them ... \" .",
    "authors bring as an example for @xmath64 the estimation of deviation in 9% between the average over measured widths and the expected one s average over the total distribution .",
    "these statements are quite true in case of small part of widths which are less than the threshold value .",
    "and they are absolutely mistaken  in case when the main part of neutron widths lie below registration threshold of experiment . belonging of the tested set to one of these extreme ( as and intermediate ) cases is determined by value of @xmath65 . in turn",
    ", it can be obtained only on the basis of necessary amount of additional experimental information .    accordingly",
    ", all the published estimates of density of neutron resonances contain unknown systematical error . in the best case",
    "it is enough ( for practical aims , for example ) small ; in the worse  changes the values of @xmath63 and @xmath15 by many times .",
    "the errors of parameters under consideration anticorrelate with each other .",
    "accordingly , at calculation of , for example , averaged neutron - interaction cross - sections , their uncertainties can be negligibly small even for large @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "however , for understanding of occurring in nucleus processes of interaction and transition between bose and fermi systems and determining them properties of nuclear matter , the achieved precision for determination of level density can be insufficient .",
    "presentation of experimental data in form of cumulative sums of @xmath61 chosen for analysis has the lowest dependence on error of determination of @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , the result obtained here could not be determined earlier in the simplest analysis methods of distributions of @xmath65 .    as a consequence , * any method for determination of mean parameters of neutron widths distributions can give only some their probabilistic values*.",
    "the main result of the neutron widths distribution analysis : the @xmath3 and @xmath4 values can be determined only with unknown systematical uncertainty whose magnitude is determined now by unknown precision of the porter - thomas distribution correspondence to concrete experimental mean @xmath2 widths .",
    "the suggested approximation of the total set of all the existing data on widths of neutron resonances does not allow one to find unambiguously determined absolute minimum of @xmath36 for the unique value of @xmath3 .",
    "the use for this aim of superposition of several distributions with the different average and dispersion allows one to obtain the lowest value of @xmath36 , first of all , for the experimental data with number of widths exceeding @xmath68 .",
    "the analysis performed shows that the probability of correspondence of the distribution @xmath61 to the simple functional dependence in nuclei of different mass is less than that for the set of noticeably differing functions .",
    "therefore , any quantitative determination of parameters of their distribution should be performed by comparison of two or more different model notions in maximum set of nuclei .",
    "the obtaining of the more unambiguous conclusions with respect to the problem considered here requires very significant increase of sets of resonances with the experimentally determined values @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) at their correspondingly decreased distortions .",
    "the increase of precision for determination of the mean parameters of the neutron width distributions requires , most probably , considerable making more precise of model notions @xcite .",
    "first of all of degree of influence of structure of the nuclear excited levels on level density and probability of emission of the nuclear reaction products in wide diapason of their energy . in particular  in region of neutron resonances .",
