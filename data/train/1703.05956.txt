    "at present increased deuteron - data needs follow the demands of on - going strategic research programs ( iter , ifmif , spiral2-nfs @xcite ) that involve deuteron beams , while the corresponding experimental and evaluated data are less extensive and accurate than for neutrons .",
    "there are currently many efforts to improve the description of deuteron reactions ( e.g. , @xcite ) also due to the use of @xmath0 , and @xmath1 surrogate reactions for neutron capture @xmath2 and induced fission @xmath3 cross sections investigations respectively , of interest for breeder reactors .    the consistent account of the direct interactions ( di ) role in deuteron interaction process @xcite ,",
    "i.e. , the breakup ( bu ) and direct reactions ( dr ) ( stripping and pick - up ) , forms the object of this work for nuclei from @xmath4al to @xmath5u .",
    "while the above - mentioned references include a detailed description of the involved model assumptions and consistent parameters sets that were either established or validated using various independent data , we briefly mention here only the updated main points of these analyzes .",
    "concerning the physical picture of the deuteron breakup in the coulomb and nuclear fields of the target nucleus , two distinct processes are considered in this respect , namely the elastic breakup ( eb ) in which the target nucleus remains in its ground state and none of the deuteron constituents interact with it , and the inelastic breakup or breakup fusion ( bf ) , where one of these deuteron constituents interacts nonelastically with the target nucleus .",
    "the reactions induced by the bf nucleons lead to different compound nuclei than following the incoming deuterons , the partition of the bf cross section among various residual nuclei being triggered by the energy spectra of the bf nucleons and the excitation functions of the pre - equilibrium ( pe ) and compound - nucleus ( cn ) reactions induced by these nucleons on the target nuclei @xcite .",
    "the bu cross sections have been obtained from an empirical parametrization @xcite of both the total ( eb+bf ) breakup @xmath6-emission and eb fractions , @xmath7 = @xmath8 and @xmath9=@xmath10 , respectively , where @xmath11 is the deuteron total - reaction cross section . at the same time",
    "the inelastic - breakup fraction is given by the difference @xmath12=@xmath7-@xmath9 .",
    "the comparison of the parametrization values and experimental @xmath7 and @xmath9 fractions @xcite , for target nuclei from @xmath4al to @xmath13th , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_bfe_e ] for deuteron energies up to 30 mev ( left ) corresponding to the experimental data basis @xcite for the @xmath9 parametrization , as well as in the extended energy range up to 80 mev ( right ) of the experimental data basis for the @xmath7 parametrization .    a first comment concerns the apparent decrease of @xmath9 at incident energies beyond the range within which it was established .",
    "since this trend has been opposite to that of @xmath7 fraction , in the absence of any available deuteron eb data at @xmath14@xmath1530 mev , the correctness of the extrapolation in the case of the eb parametrization has been checked by the comparison of its predictions and results of the continuum - discretized coupled - channels ( cdcc ) method @xcite .",
    "the good agreement between the cdcc results , eb parametrization predictions @xcite , and data systematics @xcite has increased the confidence on both cdcc approach and empirical - parametrization basic grounds at energies of the available data ( figs . 2 and 3 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "the behavior of cdcc results over 30 mev has been in agreement only with the @xmath7 parametrization .",
    "thus it has resulted that the extension of the @xmath9 empirical parametrization beyond the energies at which the corresponding data were available should be considered with caution .",
    "therefore , in order to avoid laborious cdcc calculations for each target / energy of interest , we have adopted a normalized eb fraction for the energies beyond its maximum by taking into account the cdcc results and the behavior of the @xmath7 fraction .",
    "hence , we have chosen to keep unchanged the ratio of the eb and bu fractions for the incident energies above the maximum of eb fraction @xmath16 by means of the relation @xmath17 where the energy @xmath18 corresponds to the above - mentioned maximum .",
    "thus , the normalized eb fraction follows the behavior of total breakup proton - emission fraction as it is also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_bfe_e ] , in agreement with the cdcc calculation results @xcite .",
    "this @xmath9 normalization is of particular interest , at deuteron energies above @xmath1950 mev and especially for heavier target nuclei where @xmath18 is lower , for both inelastic- and total - breakup fractions @xcite : @xmath20 assuming equal proton and neutron bu cross sections .    on the other hand ,",
    "the experimental systematics of @xmath7 @xcite includes only one data for heavy nuclei ( @xmath21@xmath15200 ) at incident energies around the coulomb barrier , which are of great interest for surrogate reaction study , namely for @xmath13th at @xmath14=15 mev .",
    "the present parametrization describes well this data as well as the one at a medium energy of 70 mev ( fig  [ fig_bfe_e ] ) .",
    "however , within the energy range between @xmath1925 and 41 mev , i.e. around the @xmath18@xmath2232 mev for this target nucleus , the corresponding total bu fraction exceeds unity ( e.g. , @xmath23=1.0215 at @xmath18 ) .",
    "consequently , we have adopted for @xmath21@xmath15200 the additional constraint that the @xmath23 fraction should be less than 90% .",
    "it has been included as well as the normalization by the use of eq .",
    "( @xmath24 ) in the code talys@xmath251.8 @xcite , corresponding to the value @xmath26 of the @xmath27 option for the bu model calculations .",
    "usually neglected or very poorly taken into account , the direct reactions play an important role in the deuteron interactions at energies around the coulomb barrier .",
    "their contribution is important for the first  chance emitted particle cross section @xcite .",
    "the @xmath28 and @xmath29 stripping , and @xmath30 and @xmath31 pick - up cross sections were calculated using the distorted - wave born approximation ( dwba ) method , within fresco code @xcite , with details given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "their correctness has been validated by the suitable description of the experimental specific data , e.g. angular distributions and double - differential cross sections .",
    "therefore , the description of the measured @xcite populations of low - lying levels in @xmath32u and @xmath33u through @xmath5u(d , p)@xmath32u and @xmath5u(d , t)@xmath33u stripping and pick - up reactions , respectively , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_fr-238ud](a , b ) , validates the correctness of the corresponding @xmath28 and @xmath30 total excitation functions in fig .",
    "[ fig_fr-238ud](c , bottom ) .",
    "sum of the total @xmath28 , @xmath30 , and bu cross sections gives a lower limit of the di contribution to the deuteron interaction with @xmath5u target nucleus .",
    "finally , the deuteron total - reaction cross section that remains to be available for the pe+cn lengthy mechanisms has to be corrected for the incident - flux leakage through di processes , i.e. the breakup , stripping and pick - up , by a reduction factor @xcite : @xmath34 the reduction factor shown on top of fig .",
    "[ fig_fr-238ud](c ) points out the di dominant role ( mainly breakup ) in the deuteron interaction with @xmath5u around coulomb barrier , which is a specific feature in the case of heavy nuclei @xcite .",
    "since last decade the surrogate reaction method @xcite has been intensively utilized to measure mainly @xmath2 and @xmath3 cross sections by means of the surrogate reactions like @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the `` desired '' @xmath2 cross section for a target nucleus @xmath21 is given in terms of the cn formation cross section @xmath35 and the branching ratio @xmath36 toward the desired @xmath37 outgoing channel : @xmath38 where @xmath39 are the spin and parity of the excited state @xmath40 .",
    "usually @xmath35 is provided by a neutron optical model potential , while theoretical branching ratios @xmath36 are often quite uncertain @xcite .",
    "they are extracted in the surrogate method by measuring in @xmath0 surrogate reaction the probability @xmath41 for the formation of the same excited - nucleus states , with the same specific @xmath40 and @xmath42 , @xmath43 values , decaying through the @xmath37-emission channel .",
    "the probability of this surrogate excited - nucleus decay through the @xmath37 channel is @xcite : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the corresponding probability for the formation of desired excited nucleus in the surrogate reaction .",
    "moreover , @xmath46 is obtained experimentally by measuring the total number of the surrogate events given by , e.g. , proton spectrum , and the number of coincidences between the surrogate ejectile and the @xmath37-decay channel , namely , the number of the @xmath47-@xmath37 coincidences : @xmath48 however , it is obvious that @xmath49 of eq .",
    "( @xmath50 ) _ does not included the contributions of cn mechanism only_. finally , simplifying the theoretical frame by additional assumptions of ( i ) similar @xmath51 distributions in both desired and surrogate reactions , and ( ii ) no @xmath51-dependence of the decay probabilities @xmath52 ( the weisskopf - ewing model ) , the desired neutron capture cross section becomes @xcite : @xmath53 the validation test of the deuteron surrogate method by comparing well known @xmath2 reaction cross sections with those obtained by analysis of surrogate @xmath0 reaction stressed out large discrepancies ( @xcite and refs .",
    "therein ) which rise question marks on this method . the reported results at variance from the surrogate @xmath5u@xmath0@xmath32u reaction at the incident energy of 15 mev , and desired @xmath5u@xmath2@xmath32u reaction , for incident - neutron energies from 0 to 1.5 mev , by ducasse _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite are involved hereafter particularly to underline the di effects .",
    "[ b ]    first , the decay probabilities @xmath46 of the residual nucleus @xmath32u were measured by ducasse _",
    "_ at the excitation energies between the corresponding neutron - binding energy @xmath54=4.806 mev and 1.5 mev above it",
    ". the protons from 15 mev deuteron - induced @xmath0 reaction on the @xmath5u target nucleus , corresponding to this excitation energy range , have energies between 12.65 and 11.15 mev ( fig .",
    "[ fig_3a ] ) .",
    "these energies are matched also by the 15 mev deuteron - breakup protons , with the maximum value @xmath55=12.65 mev .",
    "thus , these bu protons may affect the the @xmath41 measurement .",
    "second , the bu protons are correlated with the bu neutrons with energies between 0 and 1.5 mev . moreover , the bf component of these bu neutrons may interact with the @xmath5u target nucleus , populating actually the desired compound nucleus @xmath32u at the same excitation energies of interest .",
    "thus , the @xmath37-decay of the @xmath32u@xmath56 populated through @xmath5u(n@xmath57,@xmath37 ) reaction may also affect , together with the companion bf protons , the measured @xmath47-@xmath37 coincidence events and , finally , the @xmath41 measurement .",
    "third , the probability @xmath45 , given by eq .",
    "( @xmath50 ) for forming the excited nucleus @xmath32u , is decreased due to the incident flux leakage through di , according to eq .",
    "( @xmath58 ) and fig  [ fig_fr-238ud](c ) , as well as the pe processes which may precede the population of the excited nucleus @xmath32u through the cn reaction mechanism d+@xmath5u@xmath59@xmath60np@xmath61@xmath59p+@xmath32u@xmath56 .    actually , it is a laborious task to select the contribution of the cn mechanism , i.e. , _ the only one considered in the theoretical frame of surrogate reactions _ , from the measured probabilities @xmath41 .",
    "it involves several corrections concerning the processes left out . in this respect , the simple correction applied in ref .",
    "@xcite only to the single proton spectrum in eq .",
    "( @xmath62 ) does not take into account neither the strongly reduced @xmath45 probability of forming @xmath32u@xmath56 nucleus by the deuteron flux leakage through di and pe processes , nor the contributions of other than cn mechanism to the population of this nucleus .",
    "moreover , the assumption concerning the equality of the branching ratios for the deuteron surrogate and the neutron - induced reactions does not hold , due to the population and decay differences between the excited and compound nuclei formed in surrogate and desired reactions , respectively @xcite .",
    "however , one should be more careful in assuming that the failure of the surrogate - method validation tests follows the use of the too weak weisskopf - ewing approximation @xcite .",
    "it is also even the use of the hauser - feshbach formalism alone , within deuteron - surrogate reactions analysis , which can not lead to the expected good results in the absence of the unitary account of all bu+dr+pe+cn reaction mechanisms @xcite .",
    "finally it is obvious that the hard approximations that led to eq .",
    "( @xmath63 ) are not appropriate for deuteron induced reactions .",
    "therefore , the theoretical frame of deuteron surrogate method should be revised for a consistent account of the reaction mechanisms involved in the complex deuteron interactions .",
    "the present work discussed a deeper analysis of the key role of di , particularly of the breakup mechanism , in deuteron - induced reactions .",
    "firstly , a normalization of the parametrized @xcite eb fraction for @xmath14 values beyond the energy range within it was established , @xmath14@xmath6425 - 30 mev , has been provided in order to follow the behavior of the total bu proton fraction , in agreement with cdcc results .",
    "next we have analyzed the contributions of the breakup , stripping , and pick - up reaction mechanisms to d+@xmath5u interaction process , at energies around the coulomb barrier , to illustrate the importance of direct interaction processes .",
    "finally , the validation test of the @xmath5u(d , p@xmath37 ) surrogate reaction has been discussed .",
    "the disregard of the di mechanisms in the theoretical frame of deuteron surrogate - reaction method should be considered the main reason for the failure of the @xmath0 validation tests @xcite .",
    "however , the surrogate ratio method should be valid in the presence of the deuteron breakup without assuming its specific effects , due to their possible cancellations @xcite .",
