    "the paper ends up with conclusions ( sec .",
    "the electronic band structure of silicene and graphene is obtained within the ntb model with hamiltonian and overlap matrix elements taken over from previous _ ab - initio _ studies on silicon dimers @xcite and carbon dimers @xcite .",
    "the tight - binding formalism is presented in sufficient detail elsewhere @xcite and will not be described here .",
    "the phonon dispersion is calculated using dynamical matrix , derived via a perturbative approach within the ntb model @xcite .",
    "the summations over the brillouin zone for the total energy and the dynamical matrix are performed over a @xmath2 monkhorst - pack mesh , for which the lattice parameter and the phonon frequencies are converged to better than @xmath3    and @xmath4 @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "the two - phonon raman intensity is calculated within the ntb model @xcite using fourth - order quantum - mechanical perturbation theory , in which the electron - photon and electron - phonon hamiltonians are considered as perturbations to the hamiltonian of the non - interacting system of electrons , photons , and phonons .",
    "each one of the fourth - order terms can be visualized as a sequence of virtual processes of absorption of an incident photon with creation of an electron - hole pair ( state @xmath6 ) , two consecutive electron / hole scattering processes by a phonon ( states @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) , and final electron - hole annihilation ( state @xmath9 ) .",
    "the two - phonon raman intensity is given by the expression @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 ; the indices denote the initial ( @xmath12 ) , intermediate ( @xmath13 ) , and final ( @xmath9 ) states of the system of photons , electrons , holes , and phonons .",
    "in the initial state , only an incident photon is present and @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the incident photon energy . we restrict ourselves to stokes processes only .",
    "then , in the final state , there is a scattered photon and two created phonons .",
    "@xmath16 are the matrix elements for virtual processes between initial , intermediate , and final states .",
    "in particular , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the matrix elements of momentum for processes of creation and recombination of an electron - hole pair , respectively . @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the electron / hole - phonon matrix elements . the electron - photon and electron - phonon matrix elements are calculated explicitly @xcite .",
    "@xmath21 is the sum of the halfwidths of pairs of electronic and hole states ; it will be referred to as the _ electronic linewidth _ and is also calculated here @xcite .",
    "the dirac delta function ensures energy conservation for the entire process . in the calculations ,",
    "it is replaced by a lorentzian with a half width at half maximum of @xmath22 @xmath5 .",

    "all eight possible resonant scattering processes , composed of the mentioned virtual processes , are taken into account @xcite .",
    "backscattering geometry is implied .",
    "equation 1 applies only for raman scattering under resonant conditions , i.e. , when the laser excitation energy matches transitions of the system .",
    "the raman intensity is then enhanced because the real part of one , two , or three of the factors @xmath27 vanishes .",
    "this correlates the laser excitation energy , the initial and final energy of the scattered electron / hole , and the energy of the scattering phonons .",
    "generally , this leads to _ dispersive _ two - phonon raman bands , i.e. , to dependence of their position on the excitation energy @xcite . following the tradition , we call such resonant processes and the originating bands _ double - resonant _ ( dr ) .",
    "as we shall see , enhancement of the raman intensity can also take place for scattering phonons close to points with divergent two - phonon density of states ( dos ) .",
    "the position of such two - phonon bands is determined by the phonon energy at such points @xcite and , therefore , the bands are _ non - dispersive_. in both cases , in order for a raman band to be observed , it is also necessary that the electron - phonon coupling is relatively large for one or both phonons , taking part in the two - phonon scattering process .",

    "values @xcite .",
    "however , fair agreement can be achieved by downscaling the former by a factor of @xmath33 ( fig .",

    "3 , inset ) .",
    "the enhanced electron scattering by za phonons in silicene can be attributed to the corrugated atomic structure .",

    "the electronic band structure of graphene , featuring dirac cones , favors dr scattering processes .",
    "indeed , there are always pairs of electronic states at conduction and valence dirac cones , matching the laser excitation for direct electronic transitions with creation of electron - hole pairs and yielding vanishing difference @xmath37 .",
    "additionally , there are always phonons for intravalley or intervalley scattering of electrons or holes ( figs . 4(a ) and 4(c ) ) , such that @xmath38 is vanishingly small . finally , the scattering of holes or electrons by phonons with momenta , opposite to the previous ones , yields small @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , single , double , or triple resonances can take place , the latter giving dominant contribution to the raman intensity .",
    "moreover , the position of the originating two - phonon raman bands will depend on the laser excitation , i.e. , they are dispersive .    all",
    "derived raman bands of graphene for visible laser excitation are enhanced exclusively through the dr mechanism and no measurable raman signal is associated with singularities of the two - phonon dos .",

    "the less intense 2d@xmath40 band arises from intravalley scattering by lo phonons close to the @xmath35 point .",
