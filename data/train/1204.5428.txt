    "self - consistent models of spherical and disklike stellar systems are relatively simple to build using standard textbook methods @xcite , but special techniques are necessary to obtain triaxial models adequate to represent elliptical galaxies .",
    "one of the most popular of those techniques is due to @xcite : one chooses a reasonable mass distribution for the system , obtains the corresponding potential and computes a large library of orbits in that potential selecting suitable initial conditions ; weights are then assigned , according to the time spent on each orbit and in every region of space , and used to set up a system of linear equations linking the mass density in each region to the fractions of the different types of orbits , which can be finally obtained solving the system . a different method , which we will refer to as the n ",
    "body method , was due to @xcite : adopting an initial distribution of mass points , one integrates their equations of motion with an n  body code until an equilibrium configuration is reached ; the potential is then fixed and fitted with an adequate smooth approximation that allows the computation of orbits using the positions and velocities of the bodies as initial conditions .",
    "the initial distribution of bodies can be chosen in different ways to obtain a triaxial system : slow deformation of a spherical system @xcite , cold collapse of a spherical system @xcite , merging of stellar systems @xcite , and so on . nevertheless , with the n ",
    "body method it is not possible to have the degree of control over the final configuration that one has with schwarzschild s method . in the end , both methods yield the same result ( i.e. , a self - consistent stellar system and an analysis of its orbital content ) , but the method of @xcite starts with a chosen mass distribution , obtains orbits and finds which fractions of those orbits are needed to have a self - consistent system with that mass distribution , while the n  body method begins obtaining a self - consistent system and then performs the orbital analysis .",
    "chaotic motions are frequent in stellar systems @xcite , and @xcite realized that triaxial systems should include chaotic orbits but , when he introduced them in his models , the models evolved on time scales of the order of a hubble time and were not truly stable .",
    "this problem was aggravated after it became clear that cuspy models ( where near the centre the density , @xmath2 , is proportional to @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the radius and @xmath5 ) were needed for elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is perfectly possible to obtain stable triaxial models , even cuspy ones , that contain large fractions of chaotic orbits using the n  body method ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , so that several of those authors argued that the difficulty to build such systems with the method of @xcite was due to that method itself and not to a physical cause .    clearly , chaotic orbits are difficult to deal with when using the method of @xcite because they cover different regions at different times .",
    "worse still , in cuspy triaxial potentials chaotic orbits tend to be extremely sticky @xcite , and sticky orbits behave like regular orbits for long periods of time and chaotically at other intervals .",
    "let us assume , as an example , that chaotic orbits occupy part of the time an elongated region of space and another part of the time a nearly spherical region . therefore , the orbits that occupy mostly an elongated region during the integration time used to prepare the library of orbits will have large weights in that region and low weights outside it ; conversely , the orbits that occupy mostly the nearly spherical region during the same integration time will have a more or less even distribution of weight values over this region .",
    "now , when these weights are used to establish the fractions of orbits that make up the triaxial system , the orbits of the former group will be strongly favoured and the equilibrium system yielded by the method of @xcite will include many of them and few of the other group . if we then let the system evolve , the former orbits will tend to fill in a more spherical region as time goes by and , conversely , the latter orbits will adopt a flatter distribution .",
    "but , since the model included less orbits that originally had a more spherical distribution , the model will become rounder , as shown by the table 6 of @xcite for most of his models .",
    "the use of longer integration times , as @xcite advocated , does not guarantee the success of the method either , because the average behaviour of a chaotic orbit over a certain interval , no matter how long , does not necessarily coincide with its behaviour over a different interval , or even a subinterval , of the integration time . to make matters worse ,",
    "the number of orbits typically computed for schwarzschild s method is not very large , from several hundreds in the works of schwarzschild himself up to about @xmath6 in more recent work like that of @xcite , so that they do not provide a strong enough statistical basis .    on the other hand , the n ",
    "body method uses large numbers of bodies ( of the order of @xmath1 in our own more recent works ) guaranteeing good statistics and the model is created by the evolution of the system itself , that is , the dynamics take care of favoring certain orbits at the expense of others so as to reach a self - consistent state .",
    "is that state a stable one ?",
    "if all the orbits are regular it certainly is because , once reached that state , the orbits will continue filling in the same regions of space for ever , in other words , we will have a static equilibrium . if the model includes chaotic orbits",
    ", however , it is conceivable that , once in equilibrium , when part of the chaotic orbits evolves to occupy a rounder space region , another part of the chaotic orbits which had a rounder distribution evolves towards a more elongated one and fill in the phase space regions left vacant by the former , that is , we might have a dynamic rather than static equilibrium . while all this is concievable",
    "there is no guarantee that it will actually happen , but the past investigations that resulted in stable models that contained high fractions of chaotic orbits undoubtedly support this view .",
    "therefore , we want to investigate whether it is possible to obtain self - consistent models of cuspy triaxial sytems that are stable .",
    "that is , we will deal with the type of model that is most likely to contain high fractions of chaotic orbits and most difficult to obtain with schwarzschild s method .",
    "we have already obtained such models with the n ",
    "body method @xcite but , in order to compensate for the softening needed by the n  body code of l.a .",
    "aguilar @xcite we had to introduce an additional potential .",
    "here we will use the code of l. hernquist @xcite that does not need softening and that uses an expansion of the potential based on the model of @xcite that is particularly adequate for cuspy models .",
    "the next section gives a description of how we obtained our models and their main properties .",
    "section 3 presents our results on the stability and chaoticity of the models and section 4 summarizes our conclusions .",
    "we built our models following the recipe of @xcite , just as we have done in our previous investigations ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for example ) : we randomly created a spherical distribution of @xmath1 particles with a density distribution inversely proportional to the distance to the centre and a gaussian velocity distribution , and we let it collapse following the evolution with the code of @xcite ; due to the radial orbit instability , the result is a triaxial system .",
    "the gravitational constant , @xmath7 , the radius of the sphere and the total mass are all set equal to @xmath8 and the collapse time ( the one needed to reach the maximum potential energy ) turns out to be also very close to unity .",
    "we followed the initial collapse for 7 time units ( t.u .",
    ", hereafter ) and , then , we eliminated the particles with positive energy , we determined the principal axes of the inertia tensor of the @xmath9 per cent most tightly bound particles and we rotated the system so that its major , intermediate and minor axes coincide , respectively , with the x , y and z axes of coordinates .",
    "subsequently , we let the system evolve for another 300 crossing times ( @xmath10 , hereafter , see table 1 below ) , eliminated the less bound particles that had not yet reached equilibrium ( less than @xmath11 or @xmath12 per cent of the particles in all cases ) and aligned it again with the system of coordinates .",
    "we then performed a last run of @xmath13 @xmath10 to , first , obtain the final model after the initial @xmath14 @xmath10 and , second , check its stability over the final @xmath15 @xmath10 .",
    "we must recall that we are only interested in obtaining models morphologically similar to elliptical galaxies and not in creating them through a realistic process . besides",
    ", we want to make sure that our models have reached the equilibrium state before testing them for possible evolutionary effects .",
    "as we will show later , one hubble time is of the order of @xmath16 @xmath10 for our models , so that the integration times used here are indeed much larger than that time and , as indicated , do not correspond to a realistic process of galaxy formation .",
    "after several trials , we chose an integration step of @xmath17 which yielded integration errors in the energies of the individual bodies negligibly small compared to the changes in those energies due to the relaxation effects of the code @xcite . with that choice",
    ", the total energy is conserved within about @xmath18 per cent during most of the evolutions , except during the initial collapse when it is conserved only within about @xmath8 or @xmath11 per cent .",
    "@xcite investigated the approximation of n  body realizations of models of @xcite for @xmath19 with a generalization of the method of @xcite and they found that the choice of the radial basis functions seriously affects the results of the fractions of chaotic orbits or the distribution of the lyapunov characteristic exponents .",
    "the model of @xcite corresponds to the @xmath20 case of the models of @xcite so that the method of @xcite , based on the former , should be expected to yield good results for models with @xmath20 and , in fact , that is one conclusion of the work of @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is important that we stick to models with @xmath20 , not only because they are fairly cuspy , but also because the n  body method we are using works best for such models .",
    "notice that even our initial distribution ( an sphere with density proportional to the inverse of the radius ) obeys that @xmath21 value .",
    "the code of @xcite allows one to choose the number of terms in the angular and radial expansions ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively ) , so that we performed tests with different numbers of terms in the ranges @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "for every ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) pair we run three simulations that differed only in the seed number used to randomly generate the initial positions and velocities , i.e. , the three were statistically equivalent .",
    "the pairs @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 yielded models that were only moderately cuspy , with @xmath33 , so that they were discarded .",
    "it might seem odd that , despite the use of a basis of radial functions derived from the hernquist model , which has @xmath20 , the obtention of collapse models with such cuspiness is not guaranteed but , although the zero order radial function is cuspy with @xmath34 , higher order terms are not and in all likelihood their contribution flattens the cusp .",
    "most of the remaining ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) pairs might have been acceptable , as the reasons to prefer one to another were not as compelling as the low @xmath21 values that made us reject those mentioned before .",
    "pairs @xmath35 and @xmath36 yielded @xmath21 values that departed moderately ( less than 0.1 ) from @xmath8 , and the results from their different statistical realizations exhibited larger dispersions than other pairs .",
    "of the three last pairs , all with @xmath37 , the one with @xmath38 showed the most consistent results among the different statistical realizations , so that we finally decided to use those numbers of terms in our expansions .",
    "following @xcite we took the square roots of the mean square values of coordinates of the @xmath9 per cent most tightly bound particles as the semiaxes of the system ; the major , intermediate and minor axes will be dubbed @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively , hereafter .",
    "we built several models adopting different values of the dispersion for the velocity distribution , obtaining less elongated models for larger dispersion values .",
    "finally , we adopted four dispersion values that resulted in models with @xmath42 values close to @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively ( i.e. , corresponding to elliptical galaxies between hubble types e2 and e5 ) .",
    "the velocity dispersion for the e5 model was essentially zero , so that more elongated models could not be obtained .",
    "a similar result had been obtained in our previous work @xcite , where we could not obtain models more flattened than e6 and we suggested that this might hint that mergers , rather than collapses , are needed to obtain the most elongated ellipticals . for each selected value of the velocity dispersion , three different models ( dubbed @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 )",
    "were obtained using three different seed numbers for the random number generator when creating the initial distribution of particles . in brief , we prepared a grand total of 12 models , divided in 4 groups ; the models in each group resemble e2 , e3 , e4 and e5 galaxies , respectively , and the three models within each group differ from each other only from a microscopic point of view , being essentially identical from the point of view of their macroscopic properties .",
    "as in our previous work @xcite , several models display figure rotation around the minor axis , i.e. , they rotate very slowly even though their total angular momentum is zero .    @lccccccc@ @xmath47 & @xmath48 & @xmath10 & @xmath49 & @xmath50 & @xmath51 & @xmath21 & @xmath52 + e2a & 0.990 & 0.721 & 0.250 & 0.894 & 0.73 & 1.052 @xmath53 0.021 & 0.0003 @xmath53",

    "both the amounts and the senses of the changes are similar to those found in our previous works @xcite , where we attributed them mainly to relaxation effects of the multipolar code @xcite . since in those works we had used the n ",
    "body code of aguilar and we are now using that of hernquist and ostriker , we decided to perform the same checks we had made before using the models e5 , i.e. , those that exhibit the largest changes .",
    "the first check was to eliminate self - consistency , letting the systems evolve again for @xmath15 @xmath10 but keeping the coefficients of the expansion of the potential fixed at their initial values , and the results are shown in table  [ tab4 ] .",
    "the central density changes , although somewhat lower than the corresponding values of table  [ tab3 ] , are again not significant at the @xmath87 level , but the changes of the moments of inertia are much lower and generally significant at the same level .",
    "this is what could be expected from changes due to relaxation effects of the n  body code , because they would be suppressed when turning off the self - consistency .",
    "alternatively , relaxation effects should increase when the number of bodies decreases , and that was our second check .",
    "we took at random @xmath65 per cent of the particles of each one of the models e5 , increased their masses 10 times , and we run these new models self - consistently first for @xmath88 @xmath10 to let them relax , and then for another @xmath15 @xmath10 to analyze their stability .",
    "the corresponding changes are shown in table  [ tab5 ] and , except for those of the central density which remain not significant , they are substantially larger than the equivalente ones of table  [ tab3 ] .",

    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      we randomly selected between @xmath89 and @xmath90 particles from each model and adopted their positions and velocities as the initial values to obtain the orbits and investigate their chaoticity .",
    "the potentials were fixed , keeping constant the coefficients of their expansions at their final values , and the integrations were carried out in fixed coordinate systems , in those cases where the rotation velocity was not significant ( i.e. , less than three times the mean square error ) , or in systems rotating with the corresponding velocity in those cases where it was significant .",
    "we proceeded in this way to be consistent with the models obtained , but even the significant velocities are so small that their effect is in all likelihood negligible @xcite .",
    "since the potentials of our systems were fixed , all our orbits obey the energy integral ( or the jacobi integral in the case of systems with significant rotational velocity ) .",
    "therefore , regular orbits have to obey two additional isolating integrals , but we can have two kinds of chaotic orbits : partially chaotic orbits obey only one additional integral besides energy , and fully chaotic orbits have no isolating integrals other than energy .",
    "we have shown before ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for example ) that partially and fully chaotic orbits have different distributions , so that it is important to separate them in orbital structure studies .",
    "a simple , albeit computing time demanding , way of classifying regular , partially and fully chaotic orbits is through the use of the six lyapunov exponents .",
    "since phase space volume is conserved , the exponents come in three pairs of the same absolute value and opposite sign . due to energy conservation ,",
    "one of those pairs is always zero in our case , and each additional isolating integral makes zero another pair .",
    "thus , regular orbits have all their lyapunov exponents equal to zero , partially chaotic orbits have one non - zero pair and fully chaotic orbits have two .",
    "the numerical equivalent of the lyapunov exponents ( which demand to integrate the orbit over an infinite time interval ) are the finite time lyapunov characteristic numbers ( hereafter ft - lcns ) and , as in our previous works , we computed them using the liamag subroutine @xcite , kindly provided by d. pfenniger , and that we adapted with the assistance of h.d .",
    "navone to include the potential , accelerations and variational equations corresponding to the method of hernquist and ostriker .",
    "the liamag uses double precision arithmetic and a runge - kutta - fehlberg integrator of order 7 - 8 with variable time steps . as in our previous works",
    ", we adopted the integration and normalization intervals as @xmath91 and @xmath92 , respectively , and we requested a precision of @xmath93 for the step size regulation , which resulted in an energy conservation better than @xmath94 at the end of integration in all cases .",
    "we will refer to the largest ft - lcn of a given orbit as @xmath95 and the second largest one as @xmath96 , hereafter .",
    "since the ft - lcns are obtained from numerical integrations over a finite time interval ( i.e. , @xmath91 here ) , rather than the infinite one required to obtain lyapunov exponents , they can not reach zero value , but only a limiting minimum value , @xmath97 . applying the definition of the lyapunov exponents to equation ( 7 ) of @xcite",
    ", one can estimate that value as @xmath98 , where t is the integration interval ( cincotta , private communication ) , that is , a limiting value of about @xmath99 for our @xmath100 interval .",
    "this is an order of magnitude estimate only , however , and it is better to derive a more accurate value from the ft - lcns themselves using , for example , plots of the low end of the @xmath96 versus @xmath95 distribution ( i.e. , the region around that occupied by the representative points of the regular orbits ) . as an example we show in figure  [",
    "fig : lya5abc ] the corresponding plot for model e5c .",
    "the representative points of the regular orbits are concentrated on the blob at the left and those of chaotic orbits extend towards the right ( the sharp envelope of the identity line is merely due to the fact that , by definition , @xmath101 ) .",
    "clearly , any limit that attempts to separate regular from chaotic orbits can have a statistical value only , because some regular orbits may have ft - lcns slightly larger than that limit , while some chaotic orbits may have somewhat lower ft - lcns . with that caveat , using plots equivalent to that of figure  [ fig : lya5abc ] for all our models we adopted @xmath102 .",

    "is it reasonable to use such a low @xmath97 to separate regular from chaotic orbits ?",
    "would it not be more sensible to adopt a value of @xmath104 which corresponds to a lyapunov time of the same order of the hubble time ?",
    "those questions have been considered in our previous work ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for example ) and we will repeat here the same analysis done there .",

    "then we considered , for each orbit , 11 @xmath109 orbital positions separated by intervals of @xmath110 , that is , over a total interval of @xmath111 , and , for each model and for each type of orbit , we computed the mean square value of each coordinate .",

    "the method of @xcite is clearly better than that of aguilar @xcite to build cuspy triaxial stellar models , since the former needs no softening and uses a radial expansion which is particularly adequate to fit n  body distributions with @xmath0 . as a side benefit , the coefficients of both",
    "the radial and angular expansions are provided by the method itself and there is no need of additional fittings to obtain them .",
    "the only caveat is that , as shown by @xcite , the method of hernquist and ostriker is adequate for cases with @xmath0 only and , for other slopes of the cusp , other related but different methods should be preferred .",
    "the models obtained using the same parameters and changing only the seed number of the random number generator show that our results are very robust , indeed .",
    "those models exhibit essentially the same global properties ( except for the angular velocity of figure rotation ) and , with very few exceptions , the same fractions and distributions of regular , partially and fully chaotic orbits .",
    "the different angular velocities we obtained here for statistically equivalent models further complicates the little we know about the phenomenon of figure rotation ( i.e. , with zero angular momentum ) in this kind of models . on the one hand",
    ", the reality of the rotation has been checked using both the aguilar @xcite and aarseth @xcite codes by @xcite and here with the hernquist code and , on the other hand , such triaxial systems with figure rotation are just the stellar equivalent of the riemann ellipsoids of fluid dynamics , so that there is nothing misterious about their existence .",
    "nevertheless , except for the increase of the angular velocity when one goes to flatter systems , the rotation does not seem to correlate with other properties of the systems and , moreover , now it turns out that statistically equivalent systems have different velocities . even though , as already indicated , the angular velocities are so low that they have very little effect on orbital chaoticity , this phenomenon is interesting and warrants further investigation .",
    "the high stability of our models over time scales of the order of a hubble time is very well stablished .",
    "not only are the detected variations very small , but they are most likely due to relaxation effects of the n  body code . besides",
    ", it should be stressed that we have checked the stability running the models self - consistently , while checks on the stability of models resulting from the method of @xcite are usually done on fixed potentials @xcite . as we have shown , when the potential is fixed , the changes in our models are an order of magnitude smaller than those found self - consistently .",
    "although , considering the results of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , high fractions of chaotic orbits could be expected in our cuspy triaxial models , the fractions found are extremely high , indeed , exceeding @xmath152 per cent for our e2 and e3 models .",
    "it is important to emphasize that those high fractions of chaotic orbits are not merely due to the low @xmath97 adopted : had we adopted the @xmath153 limit , those models would still have had between @xmath154 an @xmath155 per cent of chaotic orbits .",
    "the main conclusion of our investigation is that it is perfectly possible to build self - consistent stellar models of cuspy triaxial elliptical galaxies that are very stable despite containing high percentages of chaotic orbits .",
    "this result confirms and extends previous work by others @xcite and ours @xcite .",
    "it also supports the suggestion by @xcite in the sense that the difficulties to obtain such models with the method of schwarzschild should be attributed to the method itself and not to physical causes .",
    "it is true that , while regular orbits always occupy the same region of space , chaotic orbits may spend a long interval occupying certain region , only to switch to a different one later on , with sticky orbits being an extreme example .",
    "but , although such behaviour conspires against obtaining stable models with high fractions of chaotic orbits with the method of schwarzschild , it does not necessarily prevents the existence of those models .",
    "all one needs is that , as some chaotic orbits abandon a region of space to explore a different one , orbits in the latter region move on to replace those in the former . in other words , rather than having a static equilibrium , with each orbit covering always the same zone , we have a dynamic equilibrium where switches from one zone to another are present but balance each other on average .",
    "our models show that such state of affairs is perfectly possible .",
