    "boundary scattering is essential for complete description of nanosystems such as quantum wells , ultrathin films or wires , _ etc . _ due to the large surface - to - volume ratio , boundaries are expected to play a much greater role in determining the overall properties in a nanostructure than in a bulk material .",
    "for example , recent scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) data have shown that electron energy spectra can be more strongly correlated to the buried interfacial lattices than to the surface immediately beneath the stm tip @xcite .",
    "these observations clearly indicate that a small lateral variation along the boundary can have a significant long range effect in a semi - ballistic electron system .",
    "thus , a more realistic description of a nanoscale quantized system must go beyond the common perfect geometric boundary and include boundary corrugations .",
    "indeed , random surface roughness of a thin metal film can dominate incoherent scattering and relaxation , and can lead to anomalous quantum size effect such as large oscillatory dependence of the in - plane conductivity on the film thickness @xcite .",
    "the same must be true not only for the quantum well ( film ) walls but also for the interlayer interfaces in multilayer films .",
    "it is well known that the roughness of the interlayer interfaces plays an important role in , for example , giant magnetoresistance ( see review @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to analyze the effect of irregular corrugation of the interlayer interfaces on the lateral conductivity of quantized multilayer films without magnetic effects .",
    "we will see that the interface scattering can result in unique features of the quantum size effect ( qse ) which are strikingly different from qse with scattering by bulk or wall inhomogeneities .",
    "orbital and spin magnetic effects of the type studied in refs .",
    "@xcite will be studied separately .    in ultrathin films",
    ", the motion of electrons across the films can be quantized .",
    "qse in metal films is studied experimentally by measuring conductivity @xcite and susceptibility @xcite of the films or in spectroscopy @xcite and stm @xcite measurements ( for earlier results , see references therein ) . as a result of qse ,",
    "the @xmath0 electron spectrum @xmath1 splits into a set of minibands @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the @xmath4 momentum along the film ( @xmath5plane ) . in the simplest case of a single - layer film approximated by a rectangular quantum well",
    ", the quantized values of the @xmath6component of momentum are @xmath7 ( here and below @xmath8 ) .",
    "if in such quantized metal films the fermi energy @xmath9 is unaffected by the quantization , the fermi surface reduces to a set of @xmath4 curves @xmath10 that correspond to cross - sections of the @xmath0 fermi surface @xmath11 by a set of planes @xmath7 , @xmath12 .",
    "this quantization of motion , which is determined by the film thickness @xmath13 , leads to several types of qse .",
    "first , any change of the film thickness @xmath13 results in the change in size and number of the fermi curves @xmath10 .",
    "this thickness - driven change in number of the fermi curves @xmath14  [ or , what is the same , number of occupied minibands @xmath2 ] leads to a singularity in the density of states .",
    "these singularities are the most obvious manifestations of qse .",
    "these singularities in the density of states , by itself , do not lead to any _ striking _ anomalies in the dependence of the lateral conductivity @xmath16 of the film on the thickness @xmath13 .",
    "the conductivity is more sensitive to electron scattering than to the density of states .",
    "however , the change in the number of the occupied minibands @xmath17 can be accompanied by a change in number of allowed scattering channels that correspond to the scattering - driven electron transitions between minibands @xmath18 . the effect of this step - like change in the number of scattering channels on the conductivity is much stronger than that of the singularities in the density of states @xcite",
    "when all scattering - driven interband transitions are allowed , qse manifests itself as a pronounced saw - like dependence of the conductivity on the film thickness .",
    "this type of qse in quantized films has been predicted both for scattering by impurities and surface inhomogeneities @xcite .",
    "when the main scattering mechanism is the scattering by surface inhomogeneities , many of the interband transitions can often be suppressed .",
    "this happens , for example , when the average size of the surface inhomogeneities @xmath19 is much larger than the the thickness of the film and/or the particle wavelength @xmath20 .",
    "then the usual qse , which is described above , disappears and is replaced by a different kind of the size effect @xcite .",
    "this anomalous qse , which is somewhat reminiscent of the magnetic breakthrough , is completely decoupled from the singularities in the density of states and is associated solely with opening of interband scattering channels for gliding electrons at certain values of the film thickness , @xmath21 .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to analyze qse in _ multilayer _ films with an emphasis on the scattering by the interface between the layers .",
    "we will see that , in addition to the above two types of qse , the multilayer films can exhibit a peculiar `` geometric '' qse with very narrow high peaks in the lateral conductivity .",
    "some of the positions of these spikes in conductivity are universal ; these spikes appear when the ratio of the thicknesses of the film layers is given by simple fractions .",
    "the position of the rest of the spikes depend on the strength of the interlayer interface .    in the next section ,",
    "we briefly present the main equations for the conductivity and introduce proper dimensionless variables .",
    "the results are presented in section iii .",
    "section iv contains the summary and brief discussion of the results .",
    "appendix contains auxiliary information on the energy spectrum of multilayer films of the type used in the calculations .",
    "for simplicity , we consider an ultrathin film of thickness @xmath13 consisting of only two layers with the thickness of @xmath22  and  @xmath23 .",
    "the interface between the layers is rough with random corrugation .",
    "the exact position of the interface , @xmath24 is described by the random function @xmath25 with the zero average , @xmath26 .",
    "the random interface inhomogeneities @xmath27 are best characterized by the correlation function @xmath28 , @xmath29 where the vector @xmath30 gives the @xmath4 coordinates along the interface and @xmath31 is the averaging area . here",
    ", it is  assumed that the correlation properties of the surface do not depend on direction .",
    "two main characteristics of the surface correlation functions @xmath32 are the average amplitude ( height ) and the correlation radius ( size ) of surface inhomogeneities , @xmath33 and @xmath19 .    to emphasize the scattering by inhomogeneities of the interlayer interface",
    ", we start from films with ideal outside walls that do not contribute to electron scattering . the combined effect of interface and wall inhomogeneities will be considered elsewhere .",
    "mostly we are interested in the dependence of the lateral conductivity on the film thickness and have in mind the following experimental situation .",
    "the first layer of the film is grown on some ( ideal ) substrate .",
    "the surface is then roughened by adding inhomogeneous adsorbate or by some other means . the growth of the second layer starts from this rough interface and the conductivity is measured at different values of @xmath23 either in the process of growth or after the growth is completed .",
    "an advantage of such setup with a buried interface is that it allows one to measure the conductivity at various values of the film thickness with _ exactly the same _ random rough interface .    in this setup ,",
    "the thickness of the first layer , @xmath22 , should be considered as fixed , while the thickness of the second layer , @xmath23 , is variable .",
    "below we are calculate the film conductivity @xmath16  as a function of the film thickness @xmath34 , @xmath35 , assuming that @xmath36 .",

    "if the material is different , then the electron potential energy between the layers differs by some @xmath37 .",
    "the the structure of the energy spectrum becomes a complicated function of @xmath37 making the behavior of conductivity highly irregular @xcite .",
    "below we consider both layers to be made of the same material with the interface being the only disruption in the potential relief .",
    "then the simplest model of the interface is the @xmath38functional potential barrier@xmath39 this immediately introduces two new physical parameters into the problem : the strength of the barrier @xmath40 and its ( average ) position @xmath22 . in what follows , we study the dependence of the conductivity on these parameters .",
    "when necessary , instead of the @xmath41-function we will study the corrugated interface with the finite width @xmath42 . in experiment",

    "the structure of the corresponding resonance spikes becomes more and more complicated with an increase in @xmath22 when the structure of the minibands and their occupancy become more convoluted .",
    "the simplest structure is observed when @xmath22 is between @xmath20 and @xmath201 as in figure 6 . in this case , the observed rational spikes correspond to the rational numbers of the form @xmath202 and are equidistant with the separation @xmath106 .",
    "the first spike corresponds to the film with @xmath203 , the second - to @xmath204 , the third - to @xmath205 , the fourth - to @xmath206 , and so on .",
    "the odd peaks , with the exception of the first one , look wider and consist of bigger and smaller sub - peaks .",
    "the smaller sub - peaks correspond to the geometrical resonance with @xmath202 which is described above .",
    "the bigger and wider sub - peaks have a somewhat different nature and are not universal with respect to the barrier strength .",
    "these sub - peaks will be described later .",
    "note , that the peak @xmath205  is so close to the first peak from the other series that these two peaks are hardly distinguishable .",
    "when @xmath22 becomes bigger , the first few geometric resonances can be observed at much narrower second layers , well before the point @xmath207 , while the density of the resonances become higher .",
    "for example , figure 7 presents the conductivity as a function of thickness for the film with the same parameters as in figure 6 except for the thickness of the first layer which is now @xmath208 .",
    "though the overall distribution of the peaks is now much more complicated , the majority can still be understood as the ones generated by the eigenfunctions of the empty quantum well with the nodes in the positions of the barrier .",
    "the complexity of the peak structure is explained by the fact that at wider first layer @xmath22  more minibands are occupied thus allowing a wider selection of the rational numbers that determine the peak positions @xmath195 .",
    "the geometric resonances can coexist with the anomalous qse of the previous section if the interface is relatively strong as in figure 8 for the same configuration as in figure 6 but with much higher value of @xmath90 , @xmath209 . for weak interfaces ,",

    "the very first resonance at @xmath214 is , as it is explained above , exactly the same as the first universal resonance .",
    "the reason why these non - universal resonances are wider and stronger than the universal ones described above is still unclear .",
    "in summary , we analyzed qse in conductivity of multilayer films when the main scattering mechanism is the scattering of electrons by random inhomogeneities of the interlayer interface .",
    "three different types of qse are predicted .",
    "the first one is a standard qse with a typical saw - like dependence of the conductivity @xmath16  on the film thickness @xmath13 , @xmath35 .",
    "this effect dominates when the correlation radius ( size ) of the interface inhomogeneities @xmath19 is much smaller than the film thickness , @xmath116 .",
    "this effect should be observed for all types of the correlation functions of the interface roughness .",
    "this effect is easily explained by the singularities in the electron density of states related to the quantization of motion across the film .",
    "the second type of qse is explained not by the quantization - driven singularities in the density of states , but by the anomalies in the cross - section for scattering by interface inhomogeneities .",
    "this scattering - driven qse replaces the standard saw - like qse when the correlation radius ( size ) of the interface inhomogeneities is large , @xmath117 .",
    "this type of qse manifests itself as smooth large - scale oscillations on the dependence @xmath35 and should be observed only when the fourier image of the interface correlation function ( the so - called power spectrum of inhomogeneities ) decays exponentially at large momenta .",
    "the main difference of this qse from a similar effect in scattering by the film walls @xcite is that the observation of this effect in multilayer film requires certain smearing of the interface .",
    "the third type of qse is new and is most unusual .",
    "this effect manifests itself as a set of very narrow and high spikes in @xmath35 and replaces the scattering - induced qse described above when the interface is narrow .",
    "the finite cutoff in the spikes can be ensured either by some other scattering mechanism or by the smearing of the interface .",
    "the spikes are observed only for certain resonance positions of the interface .",
    "the number of spikes is determined by the relation between the thickness of the layers and the fermi wavelength .",
    "the resonance positions of the interface are described .",
    "these positions can be split into two general classes .",
    "some of these positions are universal and do not depend on the amplitude of the interface potential barrier and correspond to the situations when the ratio of the layer widths is given by simple rational fractions .",
    "the integer in the denominator of such fractions does not exceed the number of occupied minibands .",
    "the remaining resonance positions of the interface are non - universal and depend on the strength of the interface potential . in the case of weak interface ,",
    "some of these non - universal positions are close to the universal ones giving the impression of a split in the conductivity spikes .",
    "too small width of the resonance spikes can impede the experimental observation of the geometric resonances .",
    "the width of the resonance spikes increases and their height decreases with increasing smearing of the interface and the resonance spikes gradually disappear .",
    "note , that this disappearance of the resonance spikes is related not to the widening , but to the random smearing of the interface - the widening of the interface , by itself , results just in a shift of the spike positions .",
    "the width of the universal resonances is equal , by the order of magnitude , to the width of the smeared interface @xmath42 , eq .",
    "( [ b11 ] ) , or , in dimensionless variables , @xmath243 .",
    "the width of non - universal resonances is somewhat larger and is less sensitive to @xmath42 ; the reason is still unclear .",
    "note , that the smearing width @xmath42 can be much smaller than the physical thickness of the interface , which in metals is often larger than or of the order of the fermi wavelength @xmath20 .",
    "in contrast to this , the smearing parameter @xmath243 can be very small .",
    "the most stable spike with respect to smearing corresponds to the layers of equal width .",
    "the wide range of possible values of @xmath42 , which are determined either by the roughness with @xmath42 of the order of @xmath33 or @xmath244 or by the `` internal '' smearing of the interface , makes the observation of the geometric resonances possible .",
    "the spikes in the conductivity occur when the scattering probabilities for electrons in one of the quantized minibands become exactly zero .",
    "since scattering probabilities for scattering by different interfaces add up , the spikes in conductivity of multilayer films with many layers can be observed only if the scattering probabilities for electrons from one miniband become zero simultaneously for scattering by all the interfaces .",
    "this can happen only if all the interfaces are located in the universal resonance positions corresponding to the rational fractions from the same series .",
    "otherwise , the scattering by inhomogeneities of the `` non - resonant interface '' will curtail the contributions from the resonant ones .",
    "this imposes a restriction on the number of layers for an observation of this type of qse for a film of fixed overall thickness .",
    "we analyzed the multilayer films under the condition that the disruption in the electron spectrum is caused only by the interface potential while electron potential deep into the layers is the same for all layers .",
    "one can imagine a different physical situation when the electron potential in different layers differ from each other as in ref .",
    "in this situation the resonance spikes in conductivity should be observed when the position of the interface coincides with one of the nodes in the wave function .",
    "it is clear that this occurs at least for certain values of the interlayer potential difference @xmath37 .",
    "the calculations in the paper are aimed primarily at the experimental setup when the lateral conductivity is measured as a function of the film thickness at fixed thickness of the first layer ( fixed position of the buried interface ) .",
    "the main obstacle for the experimental observation of the predicted effect is a rather small width of the conductivity spikes and their sensitivity to the position of the interface . on the other hand , this sensitivity of qse to the position of the interface may open the door for using this effect for precision control of the interface positions in multilayer films",
    "this may be very useful for better quality ultrathin films without short - range surface inhomogeneities @xcite .",
    "recent experiments with controlled ultrathin metal films with buried rough interfaces @xcite indicate that the existing experimental setups are sufficient for the observation of the predicted quantum size effect .",
    "usually , qse in conductivity of semiconductor films is less pronounced than for the metal films .",
    "this is explained by the smoother distribution of electrons in non - degenerate semiconductors . in the absence of sharp drop in the distribution at the fermi energy ,",
    "singular features in the conductivity , which is an integral over the particle distribution , tend to be smeared out .",
    "however , the universal geometric spikes in conductivity , which are described above , are explained by the zeroes in quantized electron wave functions on the interface and have nothing to do with the electron distribution . then these spikes in conductivity can be the only striking common feature for  qse in multilayer metal and semiconductor films .",
    "the only obstacle for observation  of such spikes in semiconductors could be a relatively large screening radius which may lead to an effective smearing of the interface .",
    "this work was supported by nsf grant dmr-0077266 .",
    "one - dimensional schrdinger equation for a square well with a @xmath245-functional barrier inside has the form@xmath246 where@xmath247 the wave functions can be written as@xmath248          in the opposite case of strong interface @xmath257 , the spectrum decouples into two independent series of levels for each layer:@xmath258 for large , but finite @xmath89 , the corrections to the spectrum @xmath259 can be easily obtained by expansion in @xmath260 or @xmath261:@xmath262 an important restriction for eq .",
    "@xmath263 is that the energy levels in each of the layers , eq .",
    "@xmath264 , should not be very close to each other . in the case of near degeneracy , the two close levels , as usual , repel each other with a resulting gap equal to@xmath265 the above equations should be modified if the interface is very close to one of the external walls of the well , _",
    "i.e. _ , if either @xmath266 or @xmath267 .    note , that if the @xmath41-type barrier is located exactly in the node of one the wave functions of the empty well , this wave function remains the eigenfunction of the well with a barrier inside irrespective of the strength of the barrier .",
    "this means that the energy levels that correspond to such wave functions are not shifted by the presence of the barrier .",
