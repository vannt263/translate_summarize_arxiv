    "the a / b system @xcite has provided pulsar astronomers and neutron - star theorists with an abundance of astrophysical phenomena to study in more detail , and with more precision , than ever before . among these",
    "is the formation and evolution of binary pulsars , and in particular how this system , and perhaps others like it , have formed and evolved to arrive at their current configurations .",
    "we have performed analysis confirming that perhaps the channel of binary evolution undergone by this system is somewhat different than that of other double neutron star ( dns ) systems for which orbital parameters and component masses have been measured .",
    "the remainder of this paper will focus on describing the direct observational constraints on this evolution that we have gained through study of this system .",
    "it is the evolution of the progenitor to the b pulsar that is believed to have caused the differences in current system properties between the a / b system and , for example , the and dns binaries as we now observe them ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the properties of the and systems suggest that the companion neutron stars ( ns ) formed via a core - collapse supernova .",
    "in particular , this is supported by their large respective eccentricities , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and their high transverse velocities , @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* respectively ) .",
    "the observed parameters of the a / b system@xmath8 and @xmath9kms@xmath10 @xcite  appear to be much lower than typically expected if the second supernova applied a large natal kick to the system , though are not by themselves conclusive evidence against a core - collapse supernova event having occurred . however , the mass of the second - formed ns , b , is also low , with @xmath11 . taken together , these properties present important clues that point to a different evolutionary path that formed the second ns .",
    "it has been suggested that this may best be explained by the progenitor to pulsar b having gone through an electron - capture supernova @xcite .",
    "this may avoid large supernova kicks due to the hypothesized short timescale over which this type of event proceeds , which is much shorter than that needed for instabilities that produce large kicks to develop .",
    "@xcite have computed models of this scenario and found that the critical mass for collapse of an o - ne - mg core should range from 1.366 to 1.375@xmath12 .",
    "it has been noted by @xcite that the ns progenitor must have a minimum mass equal to that of the neutron star _ plus _ the mass equivalent of the ns binding energy .",
    "the binding energy of the ns is given by @xmath13 @xcite , corresponding to @xmath14 for b , approximately equal to the difference between the b pulsar mass and the estimates made by @xcite of the pre - supernova mass .",
    "if indeed this pulsar was formed from a collapsing o - ne - mg core , this would mean that almost no baryonic matter would have been lost in the process .",
    "the remaining energy will have gone into changing the orbital properties of the system , and/or contributing to a kick at the time of the supernova .",
    "the measured mass of b , as well as the low transverse velocity of the system , thus present tantalizing evidence that the progenitor of the b pulsar may have ended its life in this manner .",
    "in addition , it is expected from accretion theory that the spin axis of the a pulsar will have become aligned with the total angular momentum of the binary system ( well - approximated by the orbital angular momentum ) as it gained matter donated by the b pulsar progenitor .",
    "if the supernova undergone by the b pulsar is close to symmetric , this alignment will not be disturbed @xcite .",
    "by contrast , if there is a large kick to the system , the resulting misalignment will equal the angle between the orbital planes of the system before and after the supernova event ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "several studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , have examined the explosion of the b progenitor . using the timing - derived proper motion @xcite , @xcite predict a post - supernova misalignment angle @xmath15 for a of @xmath16 .",
    "@xcite predict compatible values under different kinematic and progenitor - mass assumptions .",
    "if the above studies are correct , measuring a low spin - orbit misalignment angle for a , in conjunction with the low system eccentricity and transverse velocity , would provide crucial evidence in explaining the observed properties of this system .",
    "according to general relativity , the spin axis of a pulsar in a binary system will precess about the total angular momentum vector of the system .",
    "this occurs at a rate given by @xcite : @xmath17 where in this formulation , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are respectively the pulsar and companion masses , expressed in solar masses , @xmath20 is the orbital eccentricity , @xmath21 is the orbital period , and @xmath22 is the mass of the sun expressed in units of time .",
    "the effect of geodetic precession on the spin axis orientation of this pulsar serves to change our line of sight through the pulsar emission region over time .",
    "the extent to which these effects can be observed depends on the spin and orbital geometries of the pulsar system . in particular , this is the case for the angle of misalignment @xmath15 between the pulsar spin and orbital angular momentum , which defines the opening angle of the cone that is swept out by the spin axis over the course of a precession period .",
    "these geometric parameters can be modeled and determined through long - term analysis of the pulse profile shape .",
    "it has been shown that for , the relative amplitudes of the two major pulse components are changing significantly over time , as is the separation between these components @xcite .",
    "it has also been demonstrated that the profile displays a change in shape over time that is attributed to precession by an amount that is consistent with the general relativistic prediction @xcite .",
    "a has a precession period of @xmath23 years @xcite , much shorter than those of and .",
    "the effects of geodetic precession on the a pulse profile should thus be more readily observable on a shorter timescale than for and , provided that @xmath15 is non - negligible .",
    "using a data set that spanned almost 3 years , @xcite found no evidence that the width or shape of the a profile was changing with time .",
    "they argued that this may be attributed either to a small misalignment angle @xmath15 or to the pulsar being at or near a precession phase of @xmath24 or @xmath25 .",
    "they assumed in their analysis that the pulsar emits from a single magnetic pole and so having @xmath26 implies a broad beam structure that wraps around the neutron star , which seems rather unlikely . on the other hand , having the pulsar at a special precession phase is statistically improbable .    to further investigate , we have extended the above analysis to include data taken between june 2005 and april 2007 with the green bank telescope , using the green bank astronomical signal processor ( gasp ) backend .",
    "these data were obtained through biannual concentrated observing campaigns that spanned approximately 1 - 2 weeks each , and which typically contained 5 - 6 observing sessions that each lasted 6 - 8 hours .",
    "these observations were taken exclusively using the 820-mhz receiver , and in general , used up to @xmath27mhz frequency channels .",
    "these data have been flux - calibrated in each polarization using the signal from a noise diode source that is injected at the receiver .",
    "we then calculated an average pulse profile for each observing epoch .",
    "figure  [ fig : prof_diff ] shows the aligned and subtracted profiles for each epoch . while there seem to be subtle changes in the profile shape over the almost 2 years of observations , it is certainly not as apparent as one would expect if the spin - orbit misalignment is significantly non - zero .",
    "the combined parkes / gbt data set now spans nearly 6 years , or @xmath28 of the a precession period ; the hypothesis that the pulsar existing in a special phase of precession thus seems to be an unlikely explanation for the observed lack of profile variation .",
    ", scaledwidth=46.0% ]      the dependence of the observed pulse width on the system geometry can be expressed by the following : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is half the full pulse width , the angle @xmath31 is that between the spin and magnetic axes , @xmath32 is the angle between the a pulsar spin axis and the observer s line of sight , and @xmath33 is the opening angle of the emission cone @xcite . in using this equation , we are assuming a circular emission beam ( i.e.  no variation in @xmath33 with latitude on the pulsar surface ) . in their work",
    ", @xcite investigated the effect of using a noncircular beam , and found that the results were only marginally affected .",
    "we thus believe that a circular emission beam is a reasonable assumption for this analysis .    as discussed earlier , geodetic precession causes the angle @xmath32 , describing our line of sight , to vary over time . it can be expressed as a function of time , as well as the misalignment angle @xmath15 and epoch of zero precession phase @xmath34 , as follows @xcite : @xmath35},\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the observing epoch , and",
    "@xmath37 is the orbital inclination . in this analysis",
    "we assume that @xmath38 .",
    "the inclination @xmath39 reported by @xcite is sufficiently close to @xmath40 that the contribution from the first term in equation   does not change by a significant amount by replacing @xmath37 by @xmath41 .",
    "if indeed the spin axis of the a pulsar is aligned , or nearly aligned , with that of the orbital angular momentum , then it follows that the spin axis should be nearly @xmath40 from the region of emission .",
    "this would mean that this pulsar is an orthogonal rotator , presenting the possibility that we are viewing emission from both magnetic poles .",
    "in investigating the geometry of the a / b system , we performed analysis assuming both one- and two - pole emission models , where in the latter , each pulse component is treated as being emitted from separate magnetic poles .",
    "the parkes and gbt data were obtained at different observing frequencies , causing a systematic shift in measured pulse width due to pulse evolution with frequency . in order to be able to use all the data in a single fit , we adjust the measured parkes widths by subtracting from each of those measurements the difference between the weighted means of the gbt and parkes data sets . to obtain the errors on the adjusted parkes data ,",
    "the original parkes data uncertainties are added in quadrature to that of the difference in the two means .",
    "this subtraction is of course not physically correct , but it does allow the study of pulse shape evolution , since it retains the principle that there is zero pulse change within each data set .",
    "figure  [ fig:0737_widths ] shows the measured pulse widths assuming both one- and two - pole emission from a. for the former , we take our measurements at @xmath42 of the peak pulse height for consistency with the @xcite analysis .",
    "for the latter , we re - determined the width of each pulse component separately , opting to use the @xmath43 peak flux width for these measurements . below this fractional pulse height",
    ", there are features in the profile that , when noise is added , negatively affect our measurements , making them unreliable .",
    "we chose to leave out the initial discovery data point from the two - pole analysis , since the extremely low signal - to - noise in that profile makes it difficult to obtain a reliable width measurement .",
    "one can see that within each set of data there is no evidence for pulse shape change .",

    "this is a quantity that is determined by our line of sight to the pulsar , which we expect a priori to be uniformly distributed . in the case of @xmath31 , however , we know less about the prior distribution , and so we choose a uniform prior for lack of a more compelling option .",
    "in addition , the marginalized pdfs for @xmath15 between @xmath24 and @xmath40 are mirrored by those between @xmath40 and @xmath25 , and it has been shown that having @xmath51 is more physically likely , unless the supernova kick is extremely large , based on models of the misalignment angle in @xcite .",

    "we also find @xmath34 to be relatively unconstrained , which is expected for a low value of @xmath15 .",
