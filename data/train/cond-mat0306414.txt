    "the anyon exciton model @xcite provides a full classification of the multiple - branch spectra of a four - particle anyon exciton , a neutral composite particle consisting of a valence hole and three anyons with charge @xmath0 .",
    "this model is only applicable for large enough separation between a photoexcited hole and a two - dimensional electron gas at exact fractional filling factor , when the coulomb field from the hole can not destroy the incompressible quantum liquid .    as a neutral particle",
    ", the anyon exciton possesses an in - plane momentum @xmath1 . at @xmath2",
    "it is also described by the angular momentum @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the degree of the polynomial symmetric with respect to interchange of anyon coordinates .",
    "there is an additional quantum number which enumerates different polynomials of the same degree .",
    "an important parameter of the problem is the separation @xmath5 between electron and hole confinement planes , measured in units of magnetic length @xmath6 .",
    "two examples of numerically calculated energy spectra for @xmath7 and @xmath8 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . for @xmath7 ,",
    "the minimum of the spectrum occurs for non - zero @xmath9 , which means that the exciton in the lowest energy state possesses a non - zero dipole moment . the negative dispersion in fig .",
    "1a arises because of the mutual repulsion of @xmath10 and @xmath11 branches . for higher values of @xmath5 ,",
    "the ground state is always at @xmath2 , as in fig .  1b , and the lowest - branch dispersion is always positive .",
    "the value of @xmath4 at @xmath2 for the lowest branch increases with increasing @xmath5 , and thus direct optical transitions from the ground state are forbidden .     for two values of electron - hole separation @xmath5 .",
    "numbers show @xmath4 values ; @xmath5 is in units of magnetic length @xmath6.,width=510 ]    however , for @xmath12 the wavefunction is a mixture of states with different @xmath4 values , and magnetoroton - assisted transitions become possible .",
    "[ fig2 ] , which shows the negative charge distribution around a valence hole for two different values of @xmath9 , implies a simple qualitative picture of such a transition .",
    "a quasihole appears as a result of recombination of the hole with two negatively - charged anyons which are close to it .",
    "the quasihole and a split - off anyon form a magnetoroton .",
    "notably , for the particular value of @xmath7 used in figs .",
    "1a and 2 , the asymmetric @xmath12 distribution has a lower energy than the symmetric one .",
    "nevertheless , we wish to emphasise that the exciton remains neutral , contrary to the statements in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "such features of the anyon exciton model as multiple - branch spectra , dark ground states , and absence of @xmath13 states coincide with the results of exact diagonalisation for a few - electron system in the spherical geometry @xcite .",
    "similarities between the electron density distribution and pair correlation functions for low - lying states in planar and spherical geometries are discussed in ref .",
    "we wish to emphasise that such a comparison is only valid in the region of intermediate electron - hole separation , @xmath14 , where both approaches are applicable .",
    "the presence of a ` tight ' @xmath15 state in the upper part of the exciton energy spectrum , together with a magnetoroton - assisted transition from the lower part of the spectrum , may explain the double - line feature observed in the intrinsic spectroscopy of incompressible quantum liquids @xcite .    .",
    "the distance @xmath5 between the hole and the incompressible electron liquid is equal to two magnetic lengths .",
    "the hole is at the origin ; the @xmath16-axis is chosen in the direction of the exciton dipole moment.,width=510 ]",
    "when the separation @xmath5 exceeds two magnetic lengths ( which is a requirement for the anyon exciton model to be valid ) , the ground state at @xmath2 is formed by the states with angular momentum obeying the superselection rule @xmath17 , where @xmath18 .",
    "all these states are hard - core states , i.e. their wavefunctions are zero if any two of the anyon coordinates coincide .",
    "this means that the three anyons in the exciton form an equilateral triangle ; this is in complete agreement with the classical picture . in fact",
    ", for large values of separation , the result of a quantum mechanical calculation for the ground state energy is the same as that obtained by a simple classical approach .",
    "this is true for quasielectrons obeying both anyonic and bosonic statistics @xcite .",
    "it is natural to compare the results of classical calculations for anyon excitons and ions in both planar ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) and spherical ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) geometries .",
    "these calculations are based on minimising the classical potential energy of the system , and the hole and anyons are considered as point charges .",
    "3a shows the ` classical ' @xmath2 anyon exciton , the energy of which is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the distance from each anyon to the centre of negative charge . here , and in what follows , charge is measured in units of electron charge @xmath21 .",
    "minimising this energy with respect to @xmath20 gives @xmath22 this result coincides exactly with quantum mechanical calculations in the limit of large @xmath5 @xcite . a similar calculation for an ion ( fig .",
    "3b ) gives a potential energy @xmath23 which , when minimised , leads to @xmath24 therefore , as expected , the neutral exciton is more energetically favourable than a positively - charged ion .",
    "is the separation between the electron and hole confinement planes and @xmath20 is the distance between each anyon and the centre of negative charge .",
    "note that charges are scaled by the electron charge @xmath21.,width=510 ]     is the distance between the centre of negative charge and the centre of the sphere.,width=510 ]    for a spherical geometry , with the valence hole at the north pole of the sphere , the anyon exciton corresponds to the configuration shown in fig .",
    "4a , whereas for the ion , one of the anyons goes to the south pole of the sphere ( fig .",
    "4b ) , which corresponds to infinity on the plane .",
    "note that the electron - hole separation is taken into account by introducing an effective interaction @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is taken as the anyon - hole chord length .",
    "the expression for the energy ( with the radius of the sphere taken as unity ) is @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the distance between the centre of negative charge and the centre of the sphere .",
    "minimising this expression in the limit of large electron - hole separation @xmath5 , we obtain @xmath29 a similar calculation for the configuration in fig .",
    "4b gives a potential energy @xmath30 which , when minimised , yields @xmath31 comparing eqs .  [ eq1 ] and [ eq2 ] , one can see that for large electron - hole separation in a spherical geometry , the positively - charged ion is energetically more favourable than the neutral exciton , which is not the case in the more realistic planar geometry .    introducing realistic form factors @xcite , which reduce anyon - anyon repulsion at large distances , is unlikely to push one of the anyons to infinity and make the ion energetically favourable in the planar geometry .    in conclusion",
    ", we believe that the appearance of fractionally - charged anyon ions at the bottom of the numerically calculated excitation spectra @xcite is an artefact caused by finite - size effects in the spherical geometry .",
