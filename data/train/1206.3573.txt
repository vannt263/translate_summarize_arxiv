    ", @xcite and @xcite showed that the red fractions for central galaxies decrease as a smooth function of declining stellar mass , reaching red fractions around 10% for the lowest stellar masses ( @xmath9 ) available in large numbers in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "using spectroscopic diagnostics to define quenched galaxies , @xcite and @xcite also showed that quenched fractions decrease with stellar mass for central galaxies , reaching slightly lower quenched fractions for central galaxies at the same stellar mass .",
    "many galaxy formation models predict lower quenched fractions for lower mass central galaxies .",

    "these processes suppress gas cooling , either heating gas within the galaxy or preventing additional cold gas from accreting , and effectively shutting off star formation @xcite .",
    "low mass galaxies which are satellites of more massive objects are quenched because of the many physical mechanisms available in the group environment , such as ram pressure , harassment and tidal stripping .",
    "however , below some threshold , small _ central _ galaxies are not expected to be quenched @xcite .",
    "testing such a framework requires a large well understood sample of low mass galaxies across a range of environments .    quantifying the quenched fractions of dwarf galaxies , defined here as galaxies fainter than @xmath10 or stellar mass below @xmath11 , is challenging , largely because the colors and apparent sizes of low luminosity galaxies are similar to those of more luminous , and far more numerous , background objects",

    "distances are estimated based on the sdss nsa redshift and a model of the local velocity field @xcite .",
    "distance errors are folded into our error estimations for stellar mass .    in this paper , we focus largely on dwarf galaxies with stellar masses between @xmath25 . in the nsa catalog",

    "the 2mass sample is complete within our dwarf galaxy volume for this choice of @xmath30 . because we use several different redshift surveys ,",
    "the sample of luminous galaxies is non - uniform , especially outside the area covered by sdss main sample spectroscopy .",
    "however , we prefer to have as complete a sample of luminous galaxies as possible , in order to most reliably identify isolated dwarf galaxies .",
    "to define the environment for each dwarf galaxy , we search for the closest luminous galaxy within 1000 km  s@xmath19  in redshift and within a projected comoving distance @xmath31mpc .",
    "a small number of dwarfs have no luminous galaxy within this volume ; we set the @xmath26 values for these galaxies to 7mpc .",
    "we divide our sample between galaxies with active star formation and `` quenched '' galaxies that are not forming stars .",
    "we differentiate between these two populations using sdss spectroscopic diagnostics .",

    "the d@xmath334000 index is a measure of the light - weighted age of the stellar population @xcite . because is it measured in two 100 windows separated by 50 , it is less affected by dust reddening than broad - band galaxy colors .",
    "analogous to color indicators , we find that the d@xmath334000 strength is a function of stellar mass ( figure  [ fig_d4000 ] ) and therefore define quenched galaxies as having d@xmath334000@xmath34log@xmath35(m@xmath36 $ ] ) . at a stellar mass of @xmath37 ,",

    "these two stellar mass bins were chosen to have a roughly similar number of galaxies and straddle the stellar mass threshold of @xmath6discussed in  [ ssec_thresh ] . in both bins , the majority of quenched galaxies have red ( @xmath42 ) colors and tend to lie close to a massive parent galaxy , at values of @xmath43mpc .",

    "we will compare quantities as a function of stellar mass and do not want to use a volume - limited sample which would further reduce the number of available dwarf galaxies .",
    "galaxies in a given stellar mass bin will have a range of absolute magnitudes , and therefore a range of volume over which they could be detected in sdss . to account for this difference",
    ", we weight our sample using the @xmath47 method , determining the maximum volume @xmath48 for which each galaxy could have been found , given the spectroscopic apparent magnitude limit .",
    "the nsa catalog includes galaxies with redshifts less than @xmath49 , thus only galaxies with @xmath50 are found throughout the full sample volume .",
    "we have compared our @xmath47 weighted results to that of a volume - limited sample for objects with stellar mass greater than @xmath51 .",
    "the volume - limited results are far noisier due to the significantly smaller volume probed , but are qualitatively similar .",
    "the sdss is incomplete for low surface brightness galaxies .",
    "the sdss spectroscopic survey completeness as a function of half - light surface brightness drops below 50% at @xmath52mag  arcsec@xmath53 @xcite , and below 10% at @xmath54mag  arcsec@xmath53 . for dwarf galaxies with stellar mass below @xmath11 ,",
    "the median surface brightness of our sample is @xmath55mag  arcsec@xmath53 .",
    "given the surface brightness incompleteness , we would miss , for example , one out of the five brightest satellites around the milky way @xcite .",
    "for the purposes of this study , we are concerned only with whether or not low surface brightness galaxies are preferentially missing from our quenched sample , relative to the full catalog . in dense environments ( @xmath43mpc ) , where we detect both quenched and star forming dwarf galaxies , the surface brightness distribution of quenched systems peaks at slightly lower surface brightnesses ( @xmath56mag  arcsec@xmath53 ) as compared to the star forming sample ( @xmath55mag  arcsec@xmath53 ) . however , comparing the shape of the distributions via the kolmogorov - smirnov test suggests that the quenched galaxies in dense environments could plausibly be drawn from the surface brightness distribution of star - forming galaxies ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "unless there is a population of quenched low surface brightness galaxies that exists only in the field below the detection limits of sdss , our red fractions should not be biased by the surface brightness incompleteness of the survey .",
    "in the sections below , we calculate the quenched fraction , @xmath58 . weighting each galaxy by the total volume over which it could be observed ,",
    "the quenched fraction is :    @xmath59    where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the number of quenched and star - forming galaxies , respectively .",
    "we calculate 1-@xmath62 errors for @xmath63 by propagating poisson counting statistics errors on the independent quantities @xmath60 and @xmath61 . for cases where the number of quenched galaxies equals zero",
    ", we calculate the 1-@xmath62 upper limits directly according to @xcite .",
    "we first explore the fraction of quenched dwarf galaxies as a function of our environment parameter , @xmath26 .",
    "figure  [ fig_environ ] shows the quenched fraction @xmath63 for various bins in stellar mass .",
    "quenched galaxies are preferentially found near a massive host .",
    "the observed quenched fraction decreases with increasing values of @xmath26 , and then flattens to a constant level for @xmath26 distances greater than 1.5mpc . in our most massive stellar bin , between @xmath64 , the quenched fraction levels off at a value of @xmath65% at large distances from a host galaxy . for stellar mass less than @xmath66 ,",
    "the quenched fractions beyond 1.5mpc are effectively zero ( see  [ ssec_noreds ] for further discussion ) .",
    "in dense environments , @xmath67mpc , the quenched fraction does not appear to be a strong function of stellar mass , approaching @xmath68% in all our stellar mass bins .    based on figure  [ fig_environ ] ,",
    "we define `` field '' or `` isolated '' galaxies as those with @xmath69mpc . our definition is motivated by figure  [ fig_environ ] : we see evidence of environmental processes , in the form of increased quenched fractions , out to at least 1mpc .",
    "the host galaxies in our sample cover a range of masses : as calculated in ",
    "[ ssec_virial ] , the virial radii of our host galaxies range between @xmath70kpc , with a median virial radius of 225kpc .",
    "thus , we are seeing evidence for environment processes several times beyond the host s virial radii .",
    "this result is consistent with @xcite and we discuss implications of this statement in  [ ssec_virial ] .    in the sections below , we focus on the properties of field galaxies .",
    "our measured quenched fractions for field dwarf galaxies with stellar mass less than @xmath11  are effectively zero , while published red fractions in the same stellar mass range , based only on @xmath42 colors , are between 5 - 10% of isolated galaxies @xcite .",
    "using colors only , we reproduce the wang et al .  result ( wang et al .",
    "figure  2 ) , finding a red ( as opposed to quenched ) fraction of 6% in the mass range @xmath71  beyond 1.5mpc .",
    "we find that the majority of these red galaxies ( 46 out of 49 ) have strong h@xmath3 emission ; none of these galaxies would not pass our combined h@xmath3 plus d@xmath334000 criteria for quenching .",
    "the distribution of axis ratios ( b / a , based on the 2d sersic @xmath24-band profile fits ) for blue galaxies in this stellar mass range is peaked at 0.5 , as expected for a population of disky systems viewed at random viewing positions . the 49 isolated red star forming systems are preferentially disky , peaking at an axis - ratio of 0.32 , implying that most of these objects are edge - on star - forming galaxies which appear red due to dust - reddening .",
    "this confirms that color selection alone is not a good indicator in selecting quenched galaxies and motivates our spectroscopic criteria .",
    "previous studies have shown that massive galaxies which are the central galaxy in their dark matter halo are predominantly quenched : the quenched fractions of central galaxies is 100% for galaxies with stellar mass above @xmath72 , decreasing to 20% of galaxies with stellar mass of @xmath37@xcite .",
    "none of these sdss - based studies include galaxies less massive than @xmath73 . with our cleaned sdss dwarf galaxy sample ,",
    "we next ask whether the quenched fractions of central galaxies continue to decrease with stellar mass and if there is a threshold below which this fraction reaches zero .",
    "we compare our dwarf galaxy sample to a modified version of the group catalog from @xcite based on the sdss dr7 .",
    "this is a volume - limited ( @xmath74 ) catalog including galaxies brighter than @xmath75 . to ensure homogeneity with our dwarf galaxy sample ,",
    "we remeasure physical properties of galaxies in the tinker et al .",
    "catalog , using spectral measurements from @xcite and stellar masses from the nyu - vagc .",
    "we define quenched galaxies using the same criteria as our dwarf sample : ew h@xmath76 and d@xmath334000@xmath77log@xmath35[m@xmath78 .",

    "the halo radius is defined as the radius within which the average density is 200 times the background density .",

    "6 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the halo radius of a smaller galaxy may overlap with a larger galaxy , but will not be considered a satellite until the smaller galaxy itself is within the larger s halo radius .",
    "this motivates us to use a more restrictive definition of central galaxy .",
    "we have shown in figure  [ fig_environ ] that galaxies below a stellar mass of @xmath37  show environmental effects out to as much as 1mpc away from a massive galaxy , several times larger than the host galaxy halo radius .",
    "we therefore re - calculate the number of central galaxies in the tinker et al .",

    "75% of central galaxies in the tinker et al .",
    "catalog have @xmath69mpc in the overlapping stellar mass range of our dwarf galaxy catalog .",
    "this means that our definition of field galaxies is slightly more isolated than that of central galaxies in the tinker et al .",

    "this can be seen as slightly lower quenched fractions in the region of overlap shown in figure  [ fig_f_red ] .    in figure",
    "[ fig_f_red ] , we plot the fraction of quenched galaxies as a function of stellar mass for central / field galaxies . at high stellar masses ,",
    "quenched galaxies make up the majority of the central galaxy population . while tinker et al .  and",
    "others have shown that the quenched fraction of central galaxies is 100% for stellar masses",
    "greater than @xmath72 , our h@xmath3 cut removes objects with strong agn activity , decreasing @xmath63 at these masses . the quenched fraction decreases with stellar mass , reaching zero at a stellar mass between @xmath82 .",
    "the least massive quenched field galaxy in our sample has a stellar mass @xmath83 .",
    "we therefore conclude that there is a threshold of @xmath6  below which quenched galaxies are not found in the field .",
    "this threshold represents a fundamental stellar mass scale .",
    "dwarf galaxies with stellar mass below this scale can not quench star formation on their own .",
    "the threshold stellar mass does not change significantly for reasonable variations of our quenched definition .",
    "we list in table  1 , the number of galaxies , @xmath47 corrections and quenched fractions for our nsa sample .",
    "a stellar mass threshold of @xmath84 , below which isolated quenched galaxies do not exist , is consistent with extrapolations of previously published work @xcite and confirm , with a larger sample , the conclusions of @xcite who found no isolated quenched galaxies in the sdss dr4 in the absolute magnitude range @xmath85 .",
    "these authors use somewhat different definitions of both isolated and quenched , but also conclude that there is an absence of low mass isolated quenched galaxies .",
    "we establish above that quenched central galaxies with stellar masses below @xmath84  do not exist in the field .",
    "dwarf galaxies with stellar mass below this scale can not quench star formation on their own ; _ all _ field galaxies in our sample below this threshold are forming stars ( see  [ ssec_sf ] ) .",
    "we detect 2951  field galaxies in the stellar mass range @xmath86 .",

    "are within 2@xmath90 of a massive host galaxy and would thus be considered `` satellite '' galaxies , while 97% of objects are within 4@xmath90 . for comparison ,",
    "less than 50% of star forming dwarf galaxies are within 4@xmath90 of a massive neighbor .",
    "the furthest quenched galaxy is 8 @xmath90 from its host , while the furthest star forming dwarf galaxy is over 50@xmath90 from a massive neighbor .",
    "there are numerous proposed mechanisms to quench satellite galaxies within the virial radius of a massive galaxy .",
    "processes such as ram pressure stripping or tidally induced star formation can quickly remove or use up gas as a satellite enters the virial radius of a massive host . the handful of quenched dwarf galaxies between 2 - 8@xmath90 may be evidence for quenching processes which act at larger distances from the primary halo . alternatively , these may be `` backsplash '' galaxies which have previously been within the host virial radius , but are on either highly eccentric orbits or have been dynamical ejected from the host halo @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations suggest that up to 10% of satellites associated with a massive galaxy host can reside as far as four virial radii away , consistent with figure  [ fig_rvir ] .",
    "these galaxies are analogous to the dwarf spheroidal galaxies cetus and tucana ( m@xmath93 ) , which are roughly 1mpc , or 3@xmath94 from the milky way @xcite .",
    "our host galaxy definition is insensitive to whether or not a dwarf galaxy has a companion with stellar mass less than @xmath37 .",
    "while we do not include dwarf galaxies with obvious signs of active merging activity , there are a number of dwarf - dwarf galaxy pairs in the sdss dr8 volume .",
    "we perform a cursory search for isolated dwarf pairs , looking for two or more galaxies with stellar mass less than @xmath11  within a projected distance of 100kpc , a velocity difference less than 100 km  s@xmath19 , and are further than 1.5mpc from a massive host galaxy .",
    "we find 39 pairs matching these criteria .",
    "significant h@xmath3 is detected in all these dwarf galaxy pairs , with a median h@xmath3 ew of 40 ( slightly above the median of the full star - forming sample ) .",
    "none of the galaxies in these dwarf pairs are quenched .",
    "the fact that quenched dwarf galaxies are only found within 8@xmath90 of a more massive neighbor galaxy suggests that such dwarf - only groups are not effective at quenching their member dwarf galaxies .",
    "we will explore the properties of dwarf - dwarf systems in a future contribution .",
    "we identify 2951  galaxies with stellar mass less than @xmath95  that are in the field ( as defined here , these are also central / isolated galaxies ) .",
    "all of our field dwarf galaxies show evidence for recent star formation .",
    "we briefly examine the properties of these galaxies , deferring a full analysis for a future paper .    the vast majority of field dwarf galaxies have detected h@xmath3 gflux : 2940 out of 2951  ( 99.6% ) with stellar mass less than @xmath11  have h@xmath3 ew @xmath96 , with a median ew of 32 .",

    "this rate is comparable to that expected by extrapolating the star formation rate versus stellar mass relationship seen at higher stellar masses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the overwhelming fraction of isolated galaxies with very recent star formation suggests that this population is in a state of continuous star formation .",
    "there are 11 field dwarf galaxies ( 0.4% of the population ) which do not show h@xmath3 emission .",
    "these objects have d@xmath98 , suggesting a luminosity - weighted stellar age between 100 - 200myr based on @xcite models .",
    "we have examined the broad band sdss images and spectra of these 11 galaxies : 9 are strong post - starburst galaxies ( e.g. , k+a galaxies ) according to the criteria defined by @xcite through spectral decomposition , and two are border line cases , satisfying the more inclusive k+a criteria defined by @xcite based on h@xmath99 absorption ew .",
    "we conclude that these galaxies have shut off star formation within the past few hundred million years , and less than 1 gyr even for the two weaker k+as .",
    "the fact that we do not find old quenched galaxies in the field suggest that these rare occasions of post - starburst galaxies are a transient phase in the life of isolated dwarf galaxies : they will soon have star formation again .",
    "this population constrains the `` burstiness '' of star formation , suggesting that star formation rarely shuts off in isolated dwarf galaxies and , if so , for less than a few hundred million years .",
    "we demonstrate that quenched dwarf galaxies are rare in isolation , existing almost exclusively in the vicinity of a more massive neighbor . for field galaxies , we find a stellar mass threshold of @xmath84  below which quenched galaxies do not exist .",
    "most quenched galaxies below this stellar mass threshold are found within 2 @xmath90 of a massive host galaxy , and 97% of all quenched dwarf galaxies are found within 4 @xmath90 .    with the sdss dr8 data , we can state that quenched galaxies in the field do not exist below @xmath100 , however , we can not test this statement below @xmath101 .",
    "the sdss does not contain a sufficient number of galaxies below this stellar mass .",
    "studies of dwarf galaxies within 10mpc with stellar masses below @xmath101are consistent with our results : low mass quenched galaxies exist only within a few virial radius of the milky way , m31 or the nearby m81 group @xcite .",
    "below the detection limits of any current survey , the quenched fractions of field galaxies may rise again at extremely low stellar masses .",
    "ultra - faint galaxies ( @xmath102 , @xmath103 ) are currently detectable out to only 50kpc in the milky way halo @xcite .",
    "these galaxies are thought to form their stars only before reionization @xcite .",
    "if counterparts of the ultra - faint galaxies exist in the field , these will appear as quenched objects .",
    "thus , the quenched fractions of field galaxies may rise again at extremely low masses .",
    "there are claims in the literature of isolated quenched dwarf galaxies , however , there are no definitive examples which pass our definition of isolated / field galaxies . at slightly lower stellar mass than the present sample ,",
    "the dwarf spheroidal galaxies cetus and tucana ( @xmath104 ) , discussed in  [ ssec_virial ] , are often cited as isolated quenched galaxies , but lie within 1.5mpc ( 3 to 4 virial radius ) of the milky way .",
    "@xcite list ten candidate isolated dwarf spheroidal galaxies which they identify via visual searches .",
    "several of these candidates lie within the sdss footprint , but are well below the spectroscopic magnitude limits .",
    "these objects were not detected in hi surveys , and have no measured radial velocities or secure distance estimates .",
    "spectroscopic follow - up of these candidates will be an excellent test of our conclusions .",
    "finally , we note no contradiction with the results of @xcite who find a percentage of isolated dwarf galaxies with red broad - band colors at similar stellar masses : we demonstrate in  [ ssec_environ ] that these are dust - reddened star - forming galaxies .    the absence of isolated quenched galaxies below @xmath73provides strong constraint on the internal feedback processes regulating star formation .",
    "we find that _ all _ galaxies below this stellar mass threshold are forming stars in the field : 99.6% of isolated field galaxies have formed stars within the past 50myr , while the remaining galaxies have had star formation with the past few million years .",
    "a future paper will explore the properties of these star forming field dwarf galaxies ( blanton et al .  in prep ) . in @xcite",
    ", we presented hi follow - up for sdss dwarf galaxies , concluding that external processes were required to fully remove gas from a dwarf galaxy .",
    "exploring the hi and other properties of isolated dwarf galaxies above and below our stellar mass threshold will provide insight into the internal physical mechanisms , such as heating from supernova or active galactic nuclei , operating to quench galaxies at higher masses .",
    "our stellar mass threshold provides a strong boundary condition for any of these mechanisms to completely shut off star formation in low mass galaxies .",
