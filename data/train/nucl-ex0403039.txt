    "the main physics aim of the na57 experiment  @xcite at cern sps is the study of the onset of the multi - strange baryon and antibaryon enhancements in pb - pb collisions with respect to proton - induced reactions .",
    "the enhancement effect was first observed by wa97 at 158 @xmath1 gev/@xmath2 beam momentum  @xcite : na57 has extended the wa97 measurements over a wider centrality range and to lower beam momentum .",
    "the experimental apparatus , described in details elsewhere  @xcite , detects strange and multi - strange hyperons by reconstructing their weak decays into final states containing charged particles only .",
    "the centrality trigger selects the most central about 60% of the inelastic cross section for pb - pb collisions .",
    "the centrality of the collision is controlled through accurate analysis of the charged particle multiplicity sampled at central rapidity by two stations of silicon strip detectors .",
    "the particle selection procedure is based on geometrical and kinematical cuts and allows the extraction of clean signals with negligible background  @xcite .",
    "the collision centrality is expressed as the number of wounded nucleons computed from the multiplicity distribution and the measured trigger cross section via the glauber model , according to the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "+ the double - differential distribution in rapidity @xmath3 and transverse mass @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) for each particle type has been fitted , with the corresponding inverse slope parameters ( @xmath6 ) extracted as reported in @xcite .",
    "yields have then been calculated as the number of particles per event extrapolated to a common phase space window , covering full @xmath7 and one unit of rapidity around midrapidity : @xmath8    in the following of this paper , after a comparison with the results from the na49 experiment , we show the dependence of the k@xmath0 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 yields on centrality and energy in pb - pb collisions . a comparison with data from au - au collisions at rhic is included .",
    "the analysis of the transverse mass spectra and the energy dependence of the hyperon enhancements are discussed in detail in the contribution to this conference by g e bruno  @xcite .",
    "we have compared hyperon yields and ratios at both 40 and 158 @xmath1 gev/@xmath2 beam momentum with the available published results from corresponding measurements performed by the na49 collaboration  @xcite .",
    "for this comparison we have restricted our data to centrality ranges corresponding to those of na49 ; the k@xmath0 yields for na49 have been extracted from the published yields for charged kaons .",
    "the na49 yields are systematically lower than those measured by na57 by about 30% , both in the 40 and 158 @xmath1 gev/@xmath2 data .",
    "investigations are ongoing to find out the source of this discrepancy .",
    "neverthless , as shown in figure [ figratcompna49 ] , the systematics on the absolute yields cancel out when calculating particle ratios .     comparison of particle ratios measured by na57 and na49 experiments . ]",
    "na57 has measured k@xmath0 and hyperon yields as a function of centrality both in 40 and 158 @xmath1 gev/@xmath2 pb - pb collisions .",
    "results on yields at mid - rapidity in @xmath12 = 130 gev au - au collisions have been published by the star collaboration at rhic  @xcite . for comparison ,",
    "we have restricted our data to the same centrality ranges used in star ( most central 6% , 5% , 10% , 11% collisions for k@xmath0 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively ) .",
    "we show then in figure [ figyiecomp ] our yields per unit rapidity at 40 @xmath1 gev/@xmath2 ( @xmath12 = 8.8 gev ) and 158 @xmath1 gev/@xmath2 ( @xmath12 = 17.3 gev ) togheter with those from star .",

    "the @xmath9 and @xmath13 yields do not vary much from sps to rhic , while a clear energy dependence is seen for all three antihyperons .",
    "the antihyperon to hyperon ratios are plotted in figure [ figratcomp ] as a function of @xmath12 from sps to rhic  @xcite .",
    "comparison of antihyperon to hyperon ratios at sps and rhic energies . ]",
    "the large error bars on the @xmath14/@xmath15 ratio are due to the restriction of the na57 data sample to the star @xmath11 centrality range .",
    "the ratios increase with increasing strangeness content of the hyperon , both at rhic and sps energies .",
    "they also increase as a function of the energy , the dependence being weaker for particles with higher strangeness content .",
    "this can be understood as due to a baryon density decrease at midrapidity with increasing energy .",
    "the behaviours of the yields with the collision centrality have been also studied .",
    "all the yields grow faster than linearly with the number of participants , with a steeper centrality dependence for the lower energy data . at the lower energy ,",
    "the statistics does not allow a firm conclusion for @xmath16 and @xmath11 .",
    "the analysis of the p - be data at 40 gev/@xmath2 has allowed calculations of strangeness enhancements also at the lower energy : the results are reported at this conference in @xcite .",
    "results on k@xmath0 and hyperon production measured by the na57 experiment in 40 and 158 @xmath1 gev/@xmath2 pb - pb collisions have been reported .",
    "the measured yields at midrapidity have been compared with the results of measurements carried out by the na49 collaboration : we find a 30% systematic discrepancy on the absolute yields , while no discrepancy is observed when calculating particle ratios .",
    "the energy dependence study , where yields at sps energies are compared with those at rhic , shows that @xmath9 and @xmath13 yields per unit rapidity stay roughly constant while a clear increase with energy is seen for all three antihyperons .",
    "the antihyperon to hyperon ratios increase with energy , with a stronger dependence for particles with lower strangeness content .",
    "such a pattern is consistent with a decrease of the baryon density in the central region with increasing energy .",
    "we also observe a steeper centrality dependence of the yields ( and then of the enhancements ) at lower energy .",
