    "the study of cognitive bias has its historical roots in a classification proposed by francis bacon ( 1561 - 1626 ) of what he called the _ idola _ ( a latin plural ) of several kinds .",
    "he described these as things which obstructed the path of correct scientific reasoning .",
    "of particular interest to us are his _ idola fori _ ( illusions of the marketplace ) : due to confusions in the use of language and taking some words in science to have a different meaning than their common usage ; and _ idola theatri _ ( illusions of the theater ) : the following of academic dogma and not asking questions about the world ( see bacon  @xcite ) .    _",
    "completeness , continuity , continuum , dedekind `` gaps '' _ : these are terms whose common meaning is frequently conflated with their technical meaning . in our experience , explaining infinitesimal - enriched extensions of the reals to a professional mathematician typically elicits a puzzled reaction of the following sort : `` but how can you _",
    "extend _ the real numbers ?",
    "are nt they already _ complete _ by virtue of having filled in all the _ gaps _ already ? '' the academic dogma concerning the uniqueness of the _ continuum _ defined necessarily as the complete archimedean ordered field in the context of zfc has recently been challenged in the pages of _ intellectica _ , where numerous conceptions of the continuum were presented , ranging from s.  feferman s predicative conception of the continuum @xcite to j.  bell s conception in terms of an intuitionistic topos @xcite following lawvere @xcite .    to illustrate the variety of possible conceptions of the continuum , note that traditionally , mathematicians have considered at least two different types of continua .",
    "these are archimedean continua , or a - continua for short , and infinitesimal - enriched ( bernoulli ) continua , or b - continua for short . neither an a - continuum nor a b - continuum corresponds to a unique mathematical structure ( see table  [ continuity ] ) .",
    "thus , we have at least two distinct implementations of an a - continuum :    * the real numbers in the context of classical logic ( incorporating the law of excluded middle ) ; * brouwer s real continuum built from `` free - choice sequences '' , in the context of intuitionistic logic .",

    "a mathematician working in the tradition of archimedes , leibniz , and cauchy owes at least a residual allegiance to the idea that the most important mathematical problems are those coming from physics , engineering , and science more generally .",

    "yet , connes himself develops a theory of infinitesimals bearing a striking similarity to the ultrapower construction of the hyperreals .",
    "furthermore , he freely relies on such results as the existence of the dixmier trace , and the hahn - banach theorem .",
    "the latter results rely on similarly nonconstructive foundational material .",

    "such an enlargement is a natural generalisation .",
    "its commutative antecedent can not be criticized for commutativity , any more than one can criticize the cartan subalgebra of , say , a matrix algebra , for being abelian .",

    "such a thesis is consonant with what we called _ numerical constructivism _ in subsection  [ 51 ] .",
