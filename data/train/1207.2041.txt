    "cellular network deployment is taking on a massively heterogeneous character as a variety of infrastructure is being deployed including macro , pico , and femto base stations  @xcite , as well as fixed relay stations  @xcite and distributed antennas  @xcite . a major challenge in deploying heterogeneous cellular networks",
    "is managing interference .",
    "the problem is compounded by the observation that the deployment of much of the small cell infrastructure will be demand based and more irregular than traditional infrastructure deployments  @xcite .",
    "further , as urban areas are built out , even macro and micro base station infrastructure is becoming less like points on a hexagonal lattice and more random  @xcite .",
    "consequently , the aggregate interference environment is more complicated to model , and evaluating the performance of communication techniques in the presence of heterogeneous interference is challenging .",
    "stochastic geometry can be used to develop a mathematical framework for dealing with interference  @xcite . with stochastic geometry ,",
    "interferer locations are distributed according to a point process , often the homogeneous poisson point process ( ppp ) for its tractability .",
    "ppps have been used to model co - channel interference from macro cellular base stations @xcite , cross - tier interference from femtocells  @xcite , co - channel interference in ad hoc networks @xcite , and as a generic source of interference  @xcite .",
    "modeling co - channel interference from other base stations as performed in @xcite is a good starting point for developing insights into heterogeneous network interference . in @xcite ppps",
    "are used to model various components of a telecommunications network including subscriber locations , base station locations , as well as network infrastructure leveraging results on voronoi tessellation . in @xcite a cellular system with ppp distribution of base stations , called a shotgun cellular system , is shown to lower bound a hexagonal cellular system in terms of certain performance metrics and to be a good approximation in the presence of shadow fading . in @xcite , a comprehensive analysis of a cellular system with a ppp",
    "is presented , where key system performance metrics like coverage probability and average rate are computed by averaging over all deployment scenarios and cell sizes .",
    "the approach in @xcite is quite powerful , leading to closed form solutions for some special choices of parameters . in @xcite the outage and the handover probabilities in a ppp cellular network",
    "are derived for both random general slow fading and rayleigh fading , where mobiles are attached to the base station that provides the best mean signal power .",
    "recent work has considered extensions of @xcite to multi - tier networks . for example @xcite",
    "extends @xcite to provide some results on the signal - to - interference ratio in multi - tier networks while @xcite extends @xcite to provide remarkable simple expressions for the success probability in interference limited multi - tier networks . from our perspective , the main drawbacks of the approach in @xcite for application to existing systems is that performance is characterized for an entire system not for a given cell . as cellular networks",
    "are already built out , cellular providers will often want to know the performance they achieve in some given cells by adding additional infrastructure ( and thus interference ) in the rest of the network .",
    "it is also challenging to incorporate more complex kinds of heterogeneous infrastructure like fixed relays or distributed antennas into the signal and interference models .",
    "models for co - channel interference from ppps in general wireless settings have been considered in prior work  @xcite .",
    "references @xcite derive models for the complex noise distribution .",
    "these models assume that the noise changes on a sample - by - sample basis and are suitable for deriving optimum signal processing algorithms , for example optimum detectors .",
    "other work , see e.g. @xcite and the references therein , provide models for the noise power distribution .",
    "most system - level analysis work @xcite focuses on the noise power distribution .",
    "they assume that the interference distribution conditioned on the noise power is gaussian and thus characterize performance based on quantities like the signal - to - interference ratio or the signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio , which are not appropriate for other noise distributions @xcite .",
    "this is reasonable because cellular systems tend to have structured transmissions in time and frequency , hence the interfering sets are likely to be constant over a coding block .",
    "consequently we focus on characterizing and employing the noise power distribution in our work .",
    "we assume the full spectrum is reused among all tiers of nodes ; work on the spectrum sharing can be found in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose a simplified interference model for heterogeneous networks called the hybrid approach .",
    "the key idea is to evaluate performance in a fixed - size circular cell considering co - channel interference outside a guard region and cross - tier interference from within the cell .",
    "different sources of interference are modeled as marked poisson point processes where the mark distribution includes a contribution from small - scale fading and large - scale fading .",
    "the fixed - size cell is inscribed inside the weighted voronoi tessellation formed from the multiple sources of out - of - cell interference .",
    "the co - channel interference has two components : one that corresponds to the nearest interferer that is exactly twice the cell radius away ( the boundary of the guard region ) , and one that corresponds to the other interferers ( outside the guard region ) .",
    "an upper bound on the co - channel interference power distribution is characterized through its laplace transform as a function of distance from the cell center for the case of downlink transmission , after lower bounding the size of the exclusion region .",
    "performance is analyzed as a function of the `` relative '' distance from the receiver to the center of the cell . with suitable choice of cell radius as a function of density ,",
    "the resulting analysis ( in the case of a single tier of interferers ) is invariant to density , making the fixed - cell a `` typical '' cell .",
    "one of the key advantages of the proposed model is that no explicit user association scheme needs to be specified .",
    "user association in heterogeneous cellular networks is an important topic of investigation and prior work has considered specific user assignment schemes @xcite .",
    "two metrics , namely the received signal quality and the cell traffic load , are usually considered for selecting the serving base station . in the hybrid model",
    ", users can be arbitrarily distributed in the cell of interest without requiring any assumption on the user association . moreover ,",
    "our new calculations still operate under the assumption that users connect to the closest base station . in the presence of shadowing",
    ", this may not be realistic , as closest base station association does not necessarily have a geometric interpretation . in practice ,",
    "however , the association may be carried out in different granularity as compared to the channel dynamics .",
    "for instance , users may connect to the base station that provides the highest averaged received power ( often with biasing ) , thus the effect of fading and shadowing becomes constant and the users connect to the closest base station on average .    to facilitate simplified calculations",
    ", we use approximations based on the gamma distribution .",
    "we model the fading component using the gamma distribution as this incorporates single user and multiple user signaling strategies with rayleigh fading as special cases , along with an approximation of the composite small - scale and log - normal fading distribution  @xcite .",
    "we then approximate the interference distribution using the gamma distribution with second order moment matching ; the moments are finite because we use a nonsingular path - loss model . using the gamma approximation ,",
    "we present simplified expressions for the success probability and the average rate , assuming that the system is interference limited , i.e. our calculations are based on the signal - to - interference ratio .",
    "simulations show that the gamma approximation provides a good fit over most of the cell , and facilitates lower complexity .",
    "our mathematical approach follows that of @xcite and leverages basic results on ppps @xcite .",
    "compared with @xcite , we consider a fixed - size cell inscribed in a weighted voronoi tessellation , and do not average over possible voronoi cells .",
    "we also do not calculate system - wide performance measures , rather we focus on performance for a fixed cell of interest .",
    "we also demonstrate how to employ the proposed fixed cell analysis in a heterogeneous network consisting of mixtures of the different kinds of infrastructure .",
    "the advantage of our approach is that more complex types of communication and network topologies can be analyzed in a given target cell and key insights on the performance of advanced transmission techniques with heterogeneous interference using stochastic geometry can be obtained . compared with our prior work reported in @xcite , in this paper",
    "we make the concept of the guard region more precise in the context of random cellular networks , avoiding the ad hoc calculation of the guard radius . as a byproduct",
    ", we also modified the calculations of the interference term to include a closest interferer that sits exactly at the edge of the guard region .",
    "in addition , we deal with more general fading distributions and use the gamma approximation to simplify the calculation of the success probability and the ergodic rate .",
    "a benefit of our new model is that with a particular choice of the cell radius , the results are invariant with the base station density .",
    "guard zones have been used in other work on interference models e.g.  @xcite . in @xcite",
    "they are used to evaluate the transmission capacity in contention - based ad hoc networks not cellular networks while in @xcite they are considered in the derivation of the baseband noise distribution but not the noise power .",
    "in this paper we make frequent use of gamma random variables .",
    "we use them to model the small - scale fading distribution , to approximate the product of the small - scale and log - normal fading distribution , and to approximate the interference power . in this section",
    "we provide some background on gamma random variables to make the paper more accessible .",

    "the digamma function is implemented in many numerical packages or for large @xmath26 its asymptotic approximation can be used @xmath27 .",
    "the gamma distribution is also known as the pearson type iii distribution , and is one of a family of distributions used to model the empirical distribution functions of certain data  @xcite .",
    "based on the first four moments , the data can be associated with a preferred distribution . as opposed to optimizing over the choice of the distribution , we use the gamma distribution exclusively because it facilitates calculations and analysis .",
    "we will approximate a given distribution with a gamma distribution by matching the first and second order moments in what is commonly known as moment matching  @xcite .",
    "the two parameters of the gamma distribution can be found by setting the appropriate moments equal and simplifying .",
    "we summarize the result in the following lemma .",

    "we will need to deal with sums of independent gamma random variables with different parameters .",
    "there are various closed - form solutions for the resulting distribution  @xcite ( see also the references in the review article @xcite ) . in this paper",

    "see  @xcite .    for practical implementation , the infinite sum is truncated ; see @xcite for bounds on the error .",
    "mathematica code for computing the truncated distribution is found in @xcite . in some cases ,",
    "many terms need to be kept in the approximation to achieve an accurate result .",

    "@xcite we show that the approximation outperforms the truncated expression in ( [ eq : fullsumgamma ] ) unless a large number of terms are kept , and therefore conclude that the approximation is reasonable .",

    "a guard region of radius @xmath70 from the cell edge is imposed around the fixed cell in which no other transmitters can occupy .",
    "the role of the guard region is to guarantee that mobile users even at the edge of the typical cell receive the strongest signal power from the typical base station when neglecting channel fading , which also serves as the rule to systematically determine @xmath70 . in the homogeneous network when the transmission power of all base stations is uniform , @xmath71 . in the heterogeneous case ,",
    "the expression of @xmath70 is more complicated and is discussed in section  [ sec : extensionhetinf ] .",
    "we also introduce the concept of the dominant interferer in the hybrid model , which can be better explained with one observation from the stochastic model .",
    "intuitively , we can regard the fixed cell in the hybrid approach as the inscribing ball of a voronoi cell in the stochastic geometry model , though the size of the inscribing ball is random in the latter case . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cellular_geometry](b ) , the size of the equivalent guard region is determined by the nearest neighboring base station , i.e. the dominant interferer locating at its outer boundary . in short in the stochastic geometry model there",
    "always exists a dominant interferer locating at the outer boundary of the guard region .",
    "hence , in our proposed hybrid model , besides the ppp interferers outside the guard region , we also assume one dominant interferer uniformly distributed at the edge of the guard region in the homogeneous network .",
    "in addition , given @xmath70 , the location of the dominant interferer is independent of those of all other base stations .",
