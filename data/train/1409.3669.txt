    "the enumeration of lattice walks is a venerable topic in combinatorics , which has numerous applications as well as connections with other mathematical fields such as probability theory . in recent years",
    "the enumeration of walks confined to cones has received a lot of attention , and the present article also explores this topic .",
    "let us recall a few results for walks on @xmath2 that start at the origin and consist of steps taken in  @xmath3 , a finite subset of @xmath2 .",
    "clearly , there are @xmath4 walks of length , @xmath5 ( that is , using exactly @xmath5 steps ) , and the associated ( length ) generating function , @xmath6 is rational . here , the sum runs over all walks  @xmath7 , and @xmath8 denotes the length of @xmath7 .",
    "if we now confine walks to a ( rational ) half - space , typically by enforcing the first coordinate to be non - negative , then the resulting generating function becomes algebraic .",
    "this question was notably studied in one dimension ( walks on the half - line @xmath9 )  @xcite , but most methods can be extended to arbitrary dimension .",
    "these methods are effective and yield an explicit system of algebraic equations for the generating function .    in the past few years , the `` next '' natural case ,",
    "namely walks confined to the intersection of two half - spaces , has been extensively studied in the form of walks on @xmath10 confined to the positive quadrant @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "we call such walks quadrant walks .",
    ", in the early days of this study , it was sometimes believed , from the inspection of examples , that the associated generating function was always d - finite , , that is , satisfied a linear differential equation with polynomial coefficients .",
    "this is now known to be wrong , even for sets of small , steps , that is , sets included in @xmath12 , with @xmath13 .",
    "for example , the step set @xmath14 is associated with a d - finite ( and even algebraic ) generating function  @xcite , but d - finiteness is lost if the step @xmath15 is added  @xcite .",
    "in fact , bousquet - mlou and mishna  @xcite observed that for quadrant walks with small steps , the nature of the generating function seemed to be correlated to the finiteness of a certain group of bi - rational transformations of the @xmath16-plane associated with @xmath3 .",
    "of the 79 non - equivalent step sets ( or : models , ) under consideration , they proved that exactly 23 sets were associated with a finite group . among them",
    ", they proved that 22 models admitted d - finite generating functions .",
    "the 23rd model with a finite group was proven d - finite ( in fact , algebraic ) by bostan and kauers  @xcite .",
    "these d - finiteness results extend to the trivariate generating functions that keep track of the length and the position of the endpoint . for 51 of the 56 models with an infinite group , kurkova and raschel",
    "@xcite proved that this trivariate generating function is not d - finite , and bostan _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proved that the ( length ) generating functions for walks returning to the origin is not d - finite .",
    "the nature of the length generating function  for all , quadrant walks is still unknown in those 51 cases .",
    "the remaining 5 models were proven to have non - d - finite length generating functions by mishna and rechnitzer  @xcite and melczer and mishna  @xcite .",
    "it is now natural to move one dimension higher , and to study walks confined to the non - negative octant @xmath17 .",
    "a similar group of rational transformations can be defined : does the satisfactory dichotomy observed for quadrant walks ( finite group @xmath18 d - finite series ) persist ? here , much less is known . beyond a few explicit examples ,",
    "all we have so far is an empirical classification by bostan and kauers  @xcite of the 83682 ( possibly trivial , possibly equivalent ) models @xmath19 with at most five steps .",
    "however , their paper does not discuss the associated group .",
    "the aim of the present article is to initiate a systematic study of octant walks , their groups and their generating functions .",
    "we start from the 313912 models with at most six steps , and apply various methods in order to identify provably and/or probably d - finite cases as well as probably non - d - finite cases . all our strategies for proving d - finiteness",
    "are illustrated by examples , and have been implemented .",
    "the software that accompanies this paper can be found on http://www.risc.jku.at/people/mkauers/bobokame[manuel kauers website ] .",
    "we now give an overview of the paper .",
    "first , we discard models that are in fact half - space models ( and are thus algebraic ) , as well as models that are naturally in bijection to others ( section  [ sec : isored ] ) .",
    "this leaves us with ( only ) 35548 models with at most six steps .",
    "some of them are equivalent to a model of walks confined to the intersection of two half - spaces : we say they are two - dimensional , .",
    "the remaining ones are said to be three - dimensional , .",
    "the group of a model is defined at the end of section  [ sec : isored ] .    in section  [ sec : summary ]",
    "we describe our experimental attempts to decide , for a given model , if the group is finite and if the generating function is d - finite .",
    "by the end of the paper we will have proven all our d - finiteness conjectures .",
    "in section  [ sec : kernel ] we present the so - called algebraic kernel method , , a powerful tool that proves d - finiteness of many models with a finite group .",
    "this is a natural extension of the method applied in  @xcite to quadrant walks .    in section  [ sec : hadamard ]",
    "we show how the enumeration of walks of a hadamard model , reduces to the enumeration of certain quadrant walks .",
    "together with the algebraic kernel method , this proves all our d - finiteness conjectures for three - dimensional models ( section  [ sec : threedim ] ) .",
    "there remain 19 three - dimensional models with a finite group that may not be d - finite . among them , a striking example is the 3d analogue of kreweras quadrant model  @xcite .    in section  [ sec : twodim ] we discuss 2-dimensional octant models . to simplify the discussion we only study their projection on the relevant quadrant .",
    "this includes the ordinary quadrant models studied earlier , but also models that have several copies of the same step .",
    "for all models with a finite group , we prove the d - finiteness of the generating function . in two cases , the only proofs we found",
    "are based on computer algebra .",
    "they are described in section  [ sec : computer ] .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : final ] with some comments and questions .",
    "let @xmath3 be a subset of @xmath20 , which we think of as a set of steps , , and often call model , . to shorten notation",
    ", we denote steps of @xmath21 by three - letter words : for instance , @xmath22 stands for the step @xmath23 .",
    "we say that a step is @xmath24-positive ( abbreviated as @xmath25 ) if its first coordinate is 1 .",
    "we define similarly @xmath26 steps , @xmath27 steps and so on .",
    "note that there are @xmath28 different models .",
    "we define an @xmath3-walk , to be any walk which starts from the origin @xmath29 and takes its steps in @xmath3 .",
    "the present focus is on @xmath3-walks that remain in the positive octant @xmath17 , with @xmath30 .",
    "we are interested in the generating function that counts them by the length ( number of steps ) and the coordinates of the endpoint : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the number of @xmath5-step walks in the octant that end at position @xmath33 .",
    "the dependence of our series on @xmath34 is often omitted , writing for instance @xmath35 instead of @xmath36 , and this series is called the complete , generating function of octant walks .",
    "we are particularly interested in the nature , of this series : it is rational , if it can be written as a ratio of polynomials , algebraic , if there exists a non - zero polynomial @xmath37 $ ] such that @xmath38 , and d - finite , ( with respect to the variable @xmath34 ) if the vector space over @xmath39 spanned by the iterated derivatives @xmath40 has finite dimension ( here , @xmath41 denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath34 ) .",
    "the latter definition can be adapted to d - finiteness in several variables , for instance @xmath24 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath34 : in this case we require d - finiteness with respect to each , variable separately  @xcite .",
    "every rational series is algebraic , and every algebraic series is d - finite .    for a ring @xmath44 ,",
    "we denote by @xmath45 $ ] ( resp .  @xmath46 $ ] ) the ring of polynomials ( resp .",
    "formal power series ) in @xmath24 with coefficients in @xmath44 .",
    "if @xmath44 is a field , then @xmath47 stands for the field of rational functions in @xmath24 .",
    "this notation is generalised to several variables in the usual way .",

    "a walk of length @xmath5 taking its steps in @xmath58 can be viewed as a word @xmath59 made up of letters of @xmath3 . for @xmath60 ,",
    "let @xmath61 be the number of occurrences of @xmath62 in @xmath7 ( also called multiplicity of @xmath62 in @xmath7 ) .",
    "then @xmath7 ends in the positive octant if and only if the following three linear inequalities hold : @xmath63 where @xmath64 . of course",
    ", the walk @xmath7 remains in the octant if the multiplicities observed in each of its prefixes satisfy these inequalities .",

    "we define accordingly models of dimension ( exactly ) @xmath67 .",
    "examples are shown in figure  [ fig : dimension ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have tried hard to guess differential equations for the 19 mysterious models . in each case",
    ", we have calculated the first 5000 terms of the generating functions @xmath72 for any choice of @xmath73 in @xmath74 , but we did not find any equation .",
    "it could still be that some or all of the models are d - finite but the equations are so large that 5000 terms are not enough to detect them .",
    "unfortunately , it is quite hard to compute more terms , even if the calculations are restricted to a finite field for better efficiency .",
    "the default algorithm based on the recurrence relation   then still takes @xmath75 time and @xmath76 space , which already for @xmath77 required us to employ a supercomputer ( the one we used has 2048 processors and 16000 gigabyte of main memory ) .    for getting an idea about the expected sizes of equations , we have also guessed equations for all the 43 hadamard models with finite group and zero orbit sum .",
    "the formulas given in section  [ sec : hadamard ] for their generating functions give rise to more efficient algorithms for computing their series expansion .",
    "it turns out that the biggest equation appears for the model 00010000110001000000100001 , for @xmath78 .",
    "it has order  55 and degree  3815 , and we needed 20000 terms to construct it .",
    "this suggests that we may not have enough terms in our 19 models to guess differential equations .",
    "however , we observed that even for the models where @xmath79 satisfies only extremely large equations , at least one of the other specialisations @xmath72 with @xmath80 satisfies a small equation that can be recovered from a few hundred terms already .",
    "this is in contrast to the 19 non - hadamard step sets , where none of these series satisfies an equation that could be found with 5000 terms .",
    "for this reason , we have some doubts that these models are d - finite .",
