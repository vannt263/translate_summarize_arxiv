    "after almost one decade from the discovery of high - tc superconductivity we have certainly understood much more about magnetism rather than superconductivity . in particular",
    "since almost all the stechiometric compounds of high - tc superconductors are good antiferromagnets , well described by the two dimensional heisenberg model ( hm ) , from the very beginning a strong numerical effort has been devoted to the simulation of this model.@xcite the hm is defined by the following hamiltonian : @xmath2 where the spin one half vectors @xmath3 satisfy @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the nearest neighbor antiferromagnetic superexchange coupling , connecting nearest neighbor pairs @xmath6 .",
    "henceforth periodic boundary conditions are assumed in a finite square lattice with @xmath7 sites .",
    "although a rigorous proof that this model has long range antiferromagnetic order in two spatial dimension is still lacking , there is a general consensus that long range order exists even in this interesting case . in other words its properties should be very well understood by the simple spin - wave theory , which assumes long range antiferromagnetic order in the ground state.@xcite    in this work we give accurate ground state properties of the hm using a new and more efficient version of the green function monte carlo ( gfmc ) technique , first applied on a lattice by trivedi and ceperley , some years ago@xcite .    with the present scheme we also estimate the ground state energy of the hm on the square lattice to be @xmath8 slightly different , but more accurate of the previous gfmc estimates .",
    "analogously we obtain for the antiferromagnetic order parameter the value @xmath9 , consistent with other numerical estimates but with a very accurate control of the finite size effects .",
    "we discuss also our results for the static spin structure factor in view of the recently proposed theory for the finite size scaling in a quantum antiferromagnet.@xcite in particular we verify that , as a remarkable prediction of the theory , the small @xmath10 behavior of this function behaves as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the magnetic spin susceptibility and @xmath13 the spin wave velocity of the hm .",
    "this relation is particularly important as this function is experimentally detectable in neutron scattering experiments.@xcite    let us discuss now the technical part of our work , which is based on the gfmc , as we have mentioned before . as is well known this technique allows to sample statistically the ground state of a many body hamiltonian @xmath14 by a set of walkers @xmath15 which represent vectors @xmath16 of a large ( or even infinite ) hilbert space .",
    "the set of all configurations @xmath17 spans a normalized and complete basis .",
    "the aim of this approach is to sample statistically the ground state of @xmath14 , by a large population of walkers.@xcite as it will be described later on , in the finite dimensional case , the gfmc on a lattice is based on a statistical application of the hamiltonian matrix - vector product @xmath18 to the walker configurations @xmath19 , thus filtering out , after many iterations the desired population distribution for the ground state . in this statistical iteration",
    "however , the walker weights @xmath20 increase or decrease exponentially so that after a few iterations most of the walkers have negligible weights and some kind of reconfiguration becomes necessary to avoid large statistical errors .",
    "the process to eliminate the irrelevant walkers or generate copies of the important ones is called `` branching '' .",
    "this scheme is in principle exact only if the population of walkers is let increase or decrease without any limitation .",
    "any reconfiguration of the population size may in fact introduce some spurious correlation between the walkers that may affect the statistical sampling of the ground state . in practice for long simulation",
    "it is always necessary to control the population size , as , otherwise , one easily exceeds the maximum allowed computer memory .",
    "this control of the walker population size may introduce some kind of bias that vanishes quite slowly for infinite number of walkers.@xcite in this case only by performing several runs with different numbers of walkers one may in principle estimate the size of the residual bias .",
    "following the hetherington s work@xcite , we define here an efficient reconfiguration process at fixed number @xmath21 of walkers , with a rigorous control of the bias and without need of the conventional branching scheme .    in the last sections we present the results obtained for the hm up to @xmath22 lattice size , together with some numerical test on a small @xmath23 lattice where an accurate numerical solution is available by exact diagonalization .",
    "previous calculations on this model , using the green function monte carlo technique , were performed either without correcting the bias@xcite and controlling it for small lattices with a large number of walkers , or by correcting the bias in a way , which is probably correct , but it is not possible to prove rigorously.@xcite",
    "in the following sections we describe in detail how to evaluate the maximum eigenvector of a matrix @xmath24 with all positive definite matrix elements , using a stochastic approach . clearly in any physical problem , described by an hamiltonian @xmath14 , the most interesting eigenvalue is the lowest one : the ground state energy .",
    "this is however just a matter of notations , as the ground state of @xmath14 represents the maximum excited state of @xmath25 . in the following , for simplicity",
    ", we assume to change the sign of @xmath14 so that the physical ground state is , in this notations , the maximum eigenvector of @xmath14 .",
    "more important is instead the restriction of positive definite matrix elements @xmath26 , which drastically constrains the class of hamiltonians that can be treated with this method , without facing the old but still unsolved `` sign problem '' .",
    "whenever the hamiltonian has matrix elements with arbitrary sign schemes like `` fixed nodes approximation '' , and their recent developments to finite lattices , are possible within the gfmc method.@xcite of course if negative signs occur only in the diagonal elements of @xmath14 a simple change of the hamiltonian @xmath27 , will not change the ground state but the hamiltonian will satisfy the condition @xmath28 for large enough shift @xmath29 .",
    "for instance the heisenberg hamiltonian can be easily casted in the previous form as it had been previously shown.@xcite    from a general point of view the ground state of @xmath14 can be obtained by applying the well known power method : @xmath30 is a trial state non orthogonal to the ground state @xmath31 .    in the following a simple stochastic approach",
    "is described for evaluating the state @xmath32 . to this purpose",
    "we define a basic element of this stochastic approach : the so called walker .",
    "a walker is determined by an index @xmath17 corresponding to a given element @xmath33 of the chosen basis and a weight @xmath34 .",
    "the walker `` walks '' in the hilbert space of the matrix @xmath14 and assumes a configuration @xmath35 according to a given probability distribution @xmath36 .",
    "the task of the green function monte carlo approach is to define a markov process , yielding after a large number @xmath37 of iterations a probability distribution @xmath38 for the walker which determines the ground state wavefunction @xmath39 . to be specific in the most simple formulation one",
    "has : @xmath40 .",
    "in the following the distribution @xmath36 is sampled by a finite number @xmath21 of walkers .",
    "let us first consider the simpler case @xmath41 .",
    "in order to define a statistical implementation of the matrix multiplication @xmath42 , the standard approach is first to determine the hamiltonian matrix elements @xmath43 connected to @xmath17 which are different from zero .",
    "then a new index @xmath44 is chosen for the walker among the indices @xmath45 according to the probability determined by @xmath46 where @xmath47 has been introduced in order to satisfy the normalization condition @xmath48 .",
    "this simple iteration scheme to go from a configuration @xmath17 to a new configuration @xmath44 is easily implemented but is not sufficient to determine stochastically the matrix - vector product @xmath49 .",
    "the full matrix is a product of a stochastic matrix @xmath50 and a diagonal one @xmath51 : @xmath52 as it is intuitively clear the diagonal matrix @xmath51 , not included in the stochastic process , is very easily determined by a scaling of the weight @xmath34 of the walker : @xmath53 the two previous updates , the stochastic one ( [ markov ] ) and the deterministic one ( [ scalw ] ) define a new walker @xmath54 in place of the `` old '' walker @xmath55 , i.e. they determine a markov process .    at this point",
    "it is important to understand the evolution of the probability distribution @xmath36 after such process . a subscript @xmath37 to this function @xmath56",
    "will indicate the number of iterations of the markov process .",
    "the probability evolution @xmath57 is easily determined by @xmath58    the equation ( [ procp ] ) allows to determine , by simple iteration , what is the probability to find a walker in a given configuration @xmath55 after many steps .",
    "however the evolution @xmath59 from the initial distribution @xmath60 is more clear and transparent in terms of its momenta over the weight variable @xmath34 : @xmath61 in fact it is straightforward to verify , using eq.([procp ] ) , that : @xmath62    in particular for @xmath63 the first momentum of @xmath56 determines the full quantum mechanical information , as @xmath64 , implying that @xmath65 , by eq.([power ] ) , converges to the ground state of the hamiltonian @xmath14 .    by iterating several times even a single walker , the resulting configuration @xmath55 will be distributed according to the ground state of @xmath14 and by sampling a large number of independent configurations we can evaluate for instance the ground state energy : @xmath66 where the brackets @xmath67 indicate the usual stochastic average , namely averaging over the independent configurations .",
    "this in principle concludes the gfmc scheme .",
    "however the weight @xmath34 of the walker grows exponentially with @xmath37 ( simply as a result of @xmath37 independent products ) and can assume very large values , implying diverging variance in the above averages .    in the next sections we describe in detail this problem and a way to solve it with a _",
    "fixed _ number of walkers .",
    "the configuration @xmath68 that are generated in the markov process are distributed after long time according to the maximum right eigenstate @xmath69 of the matrix @xmath70 ( simply because @xmath71 for large @xmath37 ) which , as we have seen , is in general different from the ground state @xmath72 we are interested in , due to the weights @xmath73 that weight differently the various configurations @xmath17 distributed according to @xmath69 .",
    "we are allowed to consider this state @xmath69 as the initial trial state @xmath74 used in the power method ( [ power ] ) , and that , at any markov iteration @xmath37 , the walker had weight @xmath75 @xmath76 iterations backward , when it was at equilibrium according to the distribution @xmath69 , described before . in this way it is simple to compute the global weight of the walker with @xmath76 power method correcting factors : @xmath77 therefore , for instance , in order to compute the energy with a single markov chain of many iterations , the following quantity is usually sampled : @xmath78 with @xmath76 fixed.@xcite the reason to take @xmath76 as small as possible is that for large @xmath76 the weight factors @xmath79 diverge exponentially leading to uncontrolled fluctuations . in order to compute the variance of the @xmath79 factors we can simply apply what we have derived in the previous section and",
    "prove in few lines the exponential growth of the fluctuations of the weights . using eq.([defmomk ] )",
    "it is easily found that : @xmath80 according to eq.([defitg ] ) @xmath81 for large @xmath76 diverges exponentially fast as @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the maximum eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath84 ( @xmath85 is here a diagonal matrix @xmath86 ) , whereas the first momentum @xmath87 diverges as @xmath88 , with @xmath89 the maximum eigenvalue of the hamiltonian matrix @xmath90 .",
    "it is clear therefore that we get an exponential increase of the fluctuations @xmath91 as in general @xmath92 and the equality sign holds only if the matrix @xmath85 is a constant times the identity matrix .    in order to overcome the problem of exponentially increasing variance , in the following section",
    "we will discuss a way to propagate a set of @xmath21 walkers simultaneously . by evolving them independently ,",
    "clearly no improvement is obtained for the aforementioned large fluctuations , as for this purpose it is equivalent to iterate longer a single walker . instead ,",
    "before the variance of the weights @xmath20 becomes too large , it is better to redefine the set of walkers by dropping out the ones with a weight which is too small , and correspondingly generate copies of the more important ones , so that after this reconfiguration all the walkers have approximately the same weight . by iterating this process the weights of all the walkers",
    "are kept approximately equal during the simulation .",
    "this property yields a considerable reduction of the statistical errors , as the variance of the average weight @xmath93 is reduced by a factor @xmath94 .",
    "this allows therefore a more stable propagation even for large @xmath76 .",
    "given the @xmath21 walkers we indicate the corresponding configurations and weights with a couple of vectors @xmath95 , with each vector component @xmath96 , corresponding to the @xmath97 walker .",
    "it is then easy to generalize eq .",
    "( [ procp ] ) to many independent walkers : @xmath98 if the evolution of @xmath56 is done without further restriction each walker is uncorrelated from any other one and : @xmath99 similarly to the previous case we can define the momenta over the weight variable : @xmath100    since we are interested only to the first momentum of @xmath56 we can define a reconfiguration process that change the probability distribution @xmath59 without changing its first momentum , and in this we follow @xcite : @xmath101   \\\\ g ( \\underline{w^\\prime},\\underline{x^\\prime};\\underline{w},\\underline{x } ) & = &   \\prod\\limits_{\\displaystyle i=1}^m \\left ( { \\sum_j w_j \\delta_{\\displaystyle \\displaystyle x^\\prime_i , x_j }    \\over \\sum_j w_j   }   \\right ) \\delta ( w^\\prime_i - { \\sum_j w_j \\over m } ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hereafter the multiple integrals over all the @xmath102 variables are conventionally shorthand by @xmath103 $ ] . note that the defined green function @xmath104 is normalized @xmath105 \\sum_{\\displaystyle \\underline{x^\\prime } } g=1 $ ] .    in practice",
    "this reconfiguration process amounts to generate a new set of @xmath21 walkers @xmath106 in terms of the given @xmath21 walkers @xmath107 in the following way .",
    "each new walker @xmath108 will have the same weight @xmath109 and an arbitrary configuration @xmath110 among the possible old ones @xmath111 @xmath112 , chosen with a probability @xmath113 .",
    "it is clear that after this reconfiguration the new @xmath21 walkers have by definition the same weights and most of the irrelevant walkers with small weights are dropped out .",
    "this is just the desired reconfiguration which plays the same stabilization effect of the conventional branching scheme.@xcite for an efficient implementation of this reconfiguration scheme see the appendix .",
    "it is well known that the control of the population size @xmath21 introduces some bias in the simulation simply because some kind of correlation between the walkers is introduced .",
    "however for high accuracy calculations this bias often becomes the most difficult part to control . in this section",
    "we can instead prove that the reconfiguration of the @xmath21 walkers defined in ( [ branching ] ) does a better job .",
    "though this reconfiguration clearly introduces some kind of correlation among the walkers , it can be rigorously proven that the first momentum @xmath114 of the distribution of @xmath56 is exactly equal to the one @xmath115 of @xmath116 , obtained after reconfiguration .",
    "this means that there is no loss of information in the described reconfiguration process and @xmath117    :    by definition using ( [ gmomk ] ) and ( [ branching ] ) @xmath118    \\int \\left[d \\underline{w^\\prime } \\right ] \\sum_{\\displaystyle \\underline{x},\\underline{x^\\prime } }   \\left ( { \\sum_j w^\\prime_j \\delta_{\\displaystyle \\displaystyle x , x^\\prime_j } \\over m } \\right )   g ( \\underline{w^\\prime},\\underline{x^\\prime};\\underline{w},\\underline{x } )   p(\\underline{w}.\\underline{x})\\ ] ] the first term in the integrand contains a sum .",
    "it is simpler to single out each term of the sum @xmath119 and to integrate over all the possible variables @xmath120 but @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "it is then easily obtained that this contribution to @xmath123 conventionally indicated as @xmath124_k $ ] is given by : @xmath125_k = \\int \\left[d \\underline{w } \\right ]   \\int \\left[d w^\\prime_k\\right ]   \\sum_{\\displaystyle \\underline{x},x^\\prime_k } { w^\\prime_{\\displaystyle k } \\over m } \\,\\,\\ , \\delta_{\\displaystyle   x , x^\\prime_{\\displaystyle k } }    \\left ( { \\sum_j   w_j   \\delta _ { \\displaystyle x^\\prime_k , x_j } \\over \\sum_j w_j } \\right ) \\delta ( w^\\prime_k - { \\sum_j w_j\\over m } )   p(\\underline{w},\\underline{x})\\ ] ] then by integrating simply in @xmath126 and summing over @xmath122 in the previous integrand we easily get that @xmath124_k =   { 1 \\over m } g_{\\displaystyle 1,n } $ ] , independent of @xmath127 .",
    "finally by summing over @xmath127 we prove the statement ( [ final ] ) .",
    "using the previous result it is easy to generalize the equations ( [ defgl],[defemax ] ) , to many configurations .",
    "it is assumed that the reconfiguration process described in the previous section is applied iteratively each @xmath128 steps of independent walker propagation .",
    "the index @xmath37 appearing in the old expressions ( [ defgl],[defemax ] ) now labels the @xmath129 reconfiguration process .",
    "the measurement of the energy can be done after the reconfiguration when all the walkers have the same weight , thus in eq .",
    "( [ defgl ] ) : @xmath130 or , for a better statistical error , the energy can be sampled just before the reconfiguration , taking properly into account the weight of each single walker : @xmath131 it is important , after each reconfiguration , to save the quantity @xmath132 and reset to one the weights of each walker .",
    "thus the total weights @xmath133 , correspond to the application of @xmath134 power method iterations ( as in eq.[power ] ) to the equilibrium distribution @xmath135 , which at equilibrium is independent of @xmath37 .",
    "the value of the factor @xmath79 can be easily recovered by following the evolution of the @xmath21 walkers in the previous @xmath76 reconfiguration processes and reads : @xmath136 where the average weight of the walkers @xmath137 has been defined previously .",
    "an example on how the method works for the calculation of the ground state energy of the hm in a @xmath138 lattice is shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "remarkably our method converges very fast to the exact result with few correcting factors and with smaller error bars as compared with the original hetherington s scheme .",
    "our method does not require the population control reconfiguration at each step , and the resulting bias is considerably reduced , in the sense that , without any correcting factor , our value is five times closer to the exact result , for the example shown in fig.([fig1 ] ) .",
    "one of the most important advantages of the green function monte carlo technique is the possibility to reduce the variance of the energy by exploiting some information of the ground state wavefunction , sometimes known a priori on physical grounds . in order to understand how to reduce this variance",
    ", we just note that the method , as described in the previous sections , is not restricted to symmetric matrices , simply because we never used this property of the hamiltonian matrices . following @xcite",
    "we consider not the original matrix , but the non symmetric one : @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the so called * guiding wavefunction * , that has to be as simple as possible to be efficiently implemented in the calculation of the matrix elements and , as we will see , as close as possible to the ground state of @xmath14 .    in order to evaluate the maximum eigenvalue of @xmath141 ,",
    "corresponding obviously to the ground state of @xmath14 , the coefficient @xmath142 is now given by : @xmath141 as indicated in eq.([defemax ] ) , in this case @xmath142 reads : @xmath143 thus if @xmath140 is exactly equal to the ground state of @xmath14 then , by definition , @xmath144 , independent of @xmath68 .",
    "this is the so called * zero variance property * satisfied by the method .",
    "namely if the guiding wavefunction approaches an exact eigenstate of @xmath14 , the method is free of statistical fluctuations .",
    "of course one is never in such a fortunate situation , but by improving the guiding wavefunction one is able to considerably decrease the error bars of the energy .",
    "this property , rather obvious , is very important and non trivial .    for the application of the method to the hm we have used a jastrow like guiding function : @xmath145 where @xmath33 indicate in this case",
    "all possible spin configurations with @xmath146 defined on each site @xmath147 of the @xmath148 square lattice and with the restriction of total vanishing spin projection @xmath149 , @xmath150 represents the so called marshall sign , depending on the number @xmath151 of spin up in one of the two sublattices @xmath152 , while the long range potential is given by : @xmath153 .\\ ] ] with @xmath154 and @xmath155 belonging to the brillouin zone and assuming the appropriate discrete values of a finite system with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the constant @xmath156 is the only variational parameter in the wavefunction , that for @xmath157 is consistent with the spin wave theory solution of the hm for large spin @xmath158.@xcite",
    "the green function monte carlo can be used with success to compute also correlation functions on the ground state of @xmath14 .",
    "in fact it is simple to compute expectation values of operators that are diagonal in the chosen basis , so that to a given element @xmath17 of the basis corresponds a well defined value @xmath159 of the operator . by green function monte carlo , as we have seen",
    ", configurations @xmath55 distributed according to the desired wavefunction @xmath160 , or @xmath161 if importance sampling is implemented , are generated stochastically .",
    "however in order to compute @xmath162 a little further work is necessary as the square of the wavefunction is required to perform the quantum average . to this purpose",
    "the desired expectation value is written in the following form : @xmath163 from the statistical point of view eq.([forward ] ) amounts first to sample a configuration @xmath17 after @xmath164 gfmc reconfigurations , then to measure the quantity @xmath165 and finally to let the walker propagate forward for further @xmath166 reconfigurations .    in order to evaluate the stochastic average",
    "an approach similar to what done for the energy is clearly possible .",
    "the only change to expression ( [ defemax ] ) is to replace @xmath167 with the average measured quantity @xmath168 at the generation @xmath37 and change the corresponding weight factors in ( [ defglm ] ) as : @xmath169 where henceforth we denote with @xmath170 the value of the diagonal operator @xmath171 on the configuration @xmath172 of the @xmath173 walker , at the iteration @xmath37 .",
    "indeed these new factors ( [ defglmf ] ) contain a further propagation of @xmath166 reconfiguration processes as compared to the previous expression .",
    "it is important that both @xmath76 , correcting the bias , and @xmath166 , correcting the quantum average of the operator are finite , due to the exponential growths of the fluctuations as @xmath166 and @xmath76 increase . on the other hand",
    "these fluctuations can be controlled by enlarging the population size @xmath21 , and the method for @xmath21 large enough remains stable .",
    "a further condition is however necessary in order to control the bias in the forward walking technique .",
    "the set of measured values @xmath174 with weight factors ( [ defglmf ] ) has to be modified after each reconfiguration process occurring in the forward direction . in practice after each reconfiguration it is important to bookkeep only the values @xmath175 of the observables that survive after the reconfiguration ( we omit in the following the superscript @xmath37 for simplicity ) . in other words after each reconfiguration @xmath176 for @xmath177 with the integer function @xmath178 describing the reconfiguration process in our scheme ( after any reconfiguration the walker with index @xmath45 assumes the configuration with index @xmath178 before the reconfiguration ) .    in order to implement recursively the forward walking it is useful to store at each reconfiguration process the integer function @xmath179 for each reconfiguration @xmath37 and the values @xmath175 of the operator @xmath171 for each walker .",
    "then it is possible to compute the relevant configurations contributing to the operator @xmath171 after @xmath166 reconfiguration process by a recursive application of the integer functions @xmath180 , namely @xmath181 .",
    "it is extremely important to perform the reconfiguration process as rarely as possible since after each reconfiguration in the forward direction the number of different configurations representing an operator @xmath171 decays quickly , yielding of course a larger variance .",
    "contrary to the hetherington@xcite algorithm our scheme allows the bias control without requiring the reconfiguration at each step .",
    "an example on how this scheme works is shown in fig.([fig2 ] ) .",
    "as it is seen it is simple to reach the exact ground state average .",
    "in order to implement stochastically eq.([forward ] ) we need to apply the operator @xmath182 diagonal in configuration space , in a stochastic sense and then follow the standard stochastic iteration ( [ procp ] ) to the walker distribution @xmath56 for @xmath166 steps . to this purpose a walker from now on is identified by the triad : @xmath183 where @xmath156 represents the actual value of the measured operator @xmath171 for the walker .",
    "its value can change , as we will see later on in the reconfiguration process , and in general due to the forward walking @xmath184 . indeed only at the beginning , @xmath185 , of the forward walking iteration @xmath186 , for @xmath177 . in a probabilistic sense",
    "this is equivalent to consider the initial probability distribution : @xmath187 where @xmath60 is the equilibrium distribution of the previous markov process ( [ procp ] ) , which samples the ground state @xmath188 .    with this initial condition",
    "further @xmath166 forward walking steps are implemented to the probability distribution @xmath56 , defined with the iterations in eq.([procp ] ) and in eq.([procmany ] ) . then",
    "in order to determine the quantity ( [ forward ] ) the following ratio is evaluated : @xmath189 where the brackets indicate the average over the distribution @xmath190 .",
    "it is understood that in eq.([procp ] ) and eq.([procmany ] ) the variables @xmath191 remain unchanged .",
    "for instance the analogous of eq.([procp ] ) will be : @xmath192    however in order to satisfy the bias control property described in sec.([biasc ] ) it is necessary to update the @xmath156 variables at any reconfiguration process .",
    "analogously to the previous case it is easier to work with @xmath193 momenta of order @xmath127 of the distribution @xmath56 for fixed configuration @xmath17 ( see eq .",
    "[ defmomk ] ) : @xmath194 which for @xmath195 correspond to : @xmath196 where , as usual underlined variables represent vectors whose components refer to the single walker index @xmath197 .    with a proof exactly analogous to the one of sec.([biasc ] )",
    "it is possible to show that :    * the value of the first @xmath198 momentum @xmath199 , at the initial iteration of the forward walking @xmath185 , is equivalent to apply the operator @xmath171 to the initial distribution @xmath200 , namely @xmath201 * the following reconfiguration process , which does not change the markov chain of configurations @xmath202 but modifies slightly @xmath203 , has the bias control property also for the @xmath204 averages : @xmath205 \\ , \\left [ d \\underline{\\gamma }   \\right ] \\nonumber\\\\     g(\\underline{w^\\prime},\\underline{\\gamma^\\prime } , \\underline{x^\\prime};\\underline{w},\\underline{\\gamma},\\underline{x } ) & = &   \\prod\\limits_{\\displaystyle i=1}^m   \\delta \\left (   \\gamma^\\prime_i - { \\sum_j w_j \\gamma_j \\delta_{\\displaystyle x^\\prime_i , x_j } \\over \\sum_j w_j \\delta_{\\displaystyle x^\\prime_i , x_j } } \\right )     \\left ( { \\sum_j w_j \\delta_{\\displaystyle \\displaystyle x^\\prime_i , x_j }    \\over",
    "\\sum_j w_j   }   \\right ) \\delta ( w^\\prime_i - { \\sum_j w_j \\over m } ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first factors in the green function @xmath104 , involving the @xmath206 , represent the only difference to the previous reconfiguration process ( [ branching ] ) .",
    "thus obviously the momenta @xmath207 not involving the @xmath156 variables satisfy the same bias control property of the previous reconfiguration process ( [ branching ] )    as far as the @xmath208 momenta are concerned is possible to prove as before the mentioned bias control property : @xmath209    to this purpose , analogously to the previous case , it is convenient to single out a term @xmath210 in the definition of the first @xmath193 momentum in eq.([gmomkf ] ) , and following the same route of sec.([biasc ] ) integrate easily the green function over all possible variables @xmath211,@xmath212 @xmath213 , but the variables @xmath122 , @xmath214 and @xmath121 .",
    "these remaining integrations can be also performed analytically by first integrating in @xmath215 , then in @xmath216 and finally summing over @xmath111 .",
    "the assertion ( [ statementf ] ) is therefore proved rigorously .",
    "a simpler method to compute averages of general operators is obtained by eq .",
    "( [ ratioo ] ) performing two independent simulations for the numerator and the denominator in the equation ( [ ratioo ] ) .",
    "the remarkable advantage of this technique is the possibility to measure also off - diagonal operators @xmath217 .",
    "after the first simulation for the evaluation of the denominator we take an equilibrated walker configuration @xmath218 and apply the operator @xmath171 .",
    "whenever the operator @xmath171 is off diagonal this is not simply equivalent to scale the weight @xmath219 .",
    "in fact we need a stochastic approach to select only one of the configurations @xmath44 among the possible ones connected to @xmath17 with non zero matrix element @xmath217 .",
    "whenever @xmath220 this stochastic approach can be implemented with a two steps technique analogous to the one for the hamiltonian :    * we first scale @xmath34 by the mixed average estimate @xmath221 * then we select a random new configuration @xmath44 with a probability proportional to @xmath222    then the same reconfiguration process ( [ branching ] ) to work with a fixed number of walkers during the forward walking propagation can be efficiently applied .",
    "finally we comment that the general operators @xmath171 with arbitrary signs in the matrix elements can be always casted as a difference @xmath223 of two operators with positive definite matrix elements ; the above method can be applied to @xmath224 and @xmath225 separately .",
    "in the previous sections we have described how to obtain ground state energies and correlation functions of some class of hamiltonians on a finite lattice size . in this section",
    "we describe a successful application of this method to the hm .",
    "+ we are interested in thermodynamically converged physical quantities characterizing the quantum antiferromagnet , for instance the energy per site @xmath226 , the staggered magnetization @xmath227 , the spin - wave velocity @xmath13 , the spin susceptibility @xmath12 .",
    "use of a finite size scaling analysis is required to obtain the infinite volume limit of our data . + we compute with our method the ground state energy per site @xmath226 and the ground state expectation value of the spin - spin structure factor @xmath0 : @xmath228 which for @xmath10 equal to the antiferromagnetic momentum @xmath229 allows a finite size estimate of the order parameter @xmath230 .",
    "the known finite size scaling theory@xcite in a quantum antiferromagnet predicts that    \\a ) the ground state energy per site @xmath226 has the following leading size corrections : @xmath231 which allows an indirect evaluation of the spin - wave velocity .",
    "\\b ) further the finite size estimate of the order parameter @xmath232 approaches its converged value as @xmath233    finally neuberger and ziman @xcite , using a relativistic pion physics analogy , derived very powerful constraints on the spin - spin structure factor @xmath0 , namely that for @xmath234 it diverges as @xmath235 with a prefactor equal to @xmath236 . using their arguments",
    "it also follows immediately that @xmath237 for @xmath238 .    in spin wave theory results for the constants appearing in eqs.([efsize ] ) are given by : @xmath239 where @xmath240 and @xmath241 can be estimated on a @xmath148 finite size lattice : @xmath242 and @xmath243 and are expressed in terms of the spin wave energy @xmath244 , where @xmath245 .    in order to improve the accuracy of the finite size scaling calculation we have systematically compared our finite size data with the spin wave expansion on the same lattice sizes.@xcite this technique allows to compute explicitly the finite size corrections using the @xmath246 expansion , yielding results consistent with the previous theory for the finite size corrections . the advantage to use finite size spin wave theory is that it also implicitly determines all the subleading corrections in @xmath247 . in this approach ,",
    "the energy per site is given by : @xmath248\\ ] ] which correctly reproduces the predicted finite size scaling ( [ efsize ] ) with the spin wave velocity given by eq .",
    "( [ velsw ] ) and a finite size next leading contribution @xmath249 , appearing in the second order spin wave expansion .",
    "the latter term is inconsistent with a claim by fisher , which probably omitted higher order contributions in his analysis.@xcite on the other hand the fit of the data reported in tab,[taben ] is also in quantitative agreement with spin wave theory , also for this next leading contribution to the energy per site .    by a simple fourier transform of the finite size spin wave results for @xmath250 we obtain @xmath251 for @xmath252 , consistent with a singlet ground state and : @xmath253 after a simple inspection",
    "the leading behavior @xmath254 ( @xmath255 ) for @xmath256 ( @xmath257 ) is in agreement with the neuberger and ziman predictions , with exactly consistent prefactor @xmath258 ( @xmath259 ) within @xmath260 expansion .",
    "now we discuss the finite size results obtained with the gfmc technique described in this paper .",
    "first we compute the ground state energy per site @xmath226 and report all the data in tab .",
    "[ taben ] . according to eq .",
    "( [ efsize ] ) we make a parabolic fit in @xmath247 and obtain for the energy per site in the thermodynamic limit the value reported in tab .",
    "[ taben ] .",
    "this value differs from previous gfmc estimate@xcite , without population control error , which is exactly removed in our method .",
    "this error seems to affect significantly the large size estimate of the energy as shown in the tab.[taben ] . a recent paper by sandvik@xcite , using a completely different path integral method , reports energy values perfectly consistent with ours and with similar error bars . the spin - wave velocity",
    "is then evaluated by looking at the finite size corrections of @xmath226 .",
    "then according to eq.([efsize ] ) we obtain : @xmath261 with @xmath262 the zero order spin wave velocity .",
    "we have reached a very poor accuracy for this quantity , as it is determined by the subleading corrections of the energy , that in turn are also quite size dependent . for this quantity",
    "it is not possible to find significant differences from the second order spin wave result @xmath263 ( eq.[velsw ] ) , which is probably a more realistic and accurate value .",
    "the order parameter is evaluated by the forward walking technique with ( sec .",
    "[ fwalking ] ) or without ( sec .",
    "[ doublerun ] ) bookkeeping the branching matrix . in the latter case",
    "the spin isotropic square order parameter @xmath264 is directly evaluated , as the method is not restricted to diagonal operators .",
    "as discussed in the paper the only source of systematic errors are given by the length of the forward walking propagation @xmath166 and the number of bias correcting factors @xmath76 for the ground state .",
    "it is understood that for @xmath265 our method provides the exact finite size value for @xmath232 .",
    "the finite @xmath76 error is negligible , as we have used a large enough number of walkers to eliminate the bias with few correcting factors .",
    "the most important systematic error is due to the finite @xmath166 .",
    "its drastic and controlled reduction as a function of @xmath166 is displayed in fig.([beautiful ] ) which shows that we have achieved the converged values for @xmath232 within the error bars even for the largest system size @xmath266 .",
    "note also that the `` straight '' - forward method converges much more quickly as the total spin is conserved in this method and the convergence to the ground state is determined by the much larger gap in the same singlet subspace .",
    "our data for @xmath232 are again in perfect agreement with the sandvik s ones , who was able to obtain much smaller error bars . with the available data we have extrapolated @xmath232 by displaying the ratio of this quantity with the spin - wave prediction in fig.([vel ] ) .",
    "the suppression of the finite size effects , obtained with this analysis is remarkably good ( see table [ tabma ] ) .",
    "finally we have computed the structure factor with the forward walking technique ( sec.[fwalking ] ) for several momenta .",
    "analogously to the previous case for the order parameter , we have studied the ratio of the qmc data with the spin wave prediction given by eq.([sq ] ) .",
    "this calculation shows that the spin wave expression ( [ sq ] ) is particularly accurate close to @xmath267 but there is some deviation for small momenta . from eq.([sq ] ) the small @xmath10 limit of the structure factor can be computed analytically in spin wave expansion : @xmath268 .",
    "the ratio between our qmc data and the second order spin wave prediction is shown in fig.([sqfig ] ) and for small @xmath10 it approaches the value @xmath269 , rather independently from the system size .",
    "this yields , by eq .",
    "( [ pion ] ) , a direct determination of the product of the spin wave velocity and the susceptibility : @xmath270 .",
    "this value is very much in disagreement with sandvik s one @xcite who predicted @xmath271 , about four error bars out from our direct and more accurate result .",
    "this discrepancy is probably due to a very difficult infinite size extrapolation of @xmath12@xcite and @xmath13 , whereas the product @xmath272 calculated by means of @xmath0 for small momenta , seems rather well behaved , as shown in fig.([sqfig ] ) . in the same figure",
    "the prefactor around @xmath267 is in quite reasonable agreement with the expected one ( full big dot ) @xmath273 obtained with our independent measures of @xmath274 ( slope @xmath275 for @xmath276 ) and @xmath277 ( @xmath278 for @xmath279 ) , considering also that this function , according to the neuberger and ziman s theory , should jump discontinuously at @xmath279 , where it assumes a value determined only by the the order parameter @xmath277 .",
    "the shape of the curve displayed in fig,([sqfig ] ) is clearly consistent with the predicted singularity .",
    "our results therefore represent a direct confirmation about the internal consistency of the neuberger and ziman s theory .",
    "the values for the physical quantities extrapolated in the thermodynamic limit is summarized in table ( [ tabfinal ] ) .",
    "we have described in detail a straightforward implementation of the green function monte carlo scheme on a lattice hamiltonian without need of the standard branching process .",
    "the extension of such a scheme to continuum systems such as @xmath280 is straightforward .",
    "indeed the present algorithm works at fixed number of walkers and we have shown that all sources of systematic error can be controlled with a rigorous approach both for computing the ground state energy and for computing ground state correlation functions . the possibility to work with a limited number of walkers is extremely important for high accuracy calculations .",
    "this in fact requires quite long simulations to decrease the statistical errors and , with the standard approach@xcite , one easily exceeds the maximum number of walkers for the available computer memory .",
    "our reconfiguration scheme is not restricted to work at fixed number of walkers .",
    "in fact our proofs in sections [ biasc],[forwthe ] can be readily generalized when the number @xmath281 of outgoing walkers @xmath110 ( with unit weight ) is different from the number @xmath21 of the incoming ones @xmath102 @xmath172 .",
    "thus a standard branching scheme between two consecutive reconfigurations can be also applied , and the method can be used only each time the population of walkers reaches an exceedingly large or small size . at each stochastic reconfiguration",
    "the simple factor @xmath282 corrects _ exactly _ the bias of the described size population control .",
    "this maybe a more efficient implementation of our method , with , however , a rather more involved algorithm .",
    "this scheme represents a more practical implementation of the hetherington idea to work at fixed number of walkers as :    \\i ) it is not required to apply the reconfiguration process at each markov iteration .",
    "indeed our scheme coincides with the hetherington one in this limit .",
    "\\ii ) the same idea to control the bias at fixed number of walkers was extended to the `` forward walking technique '' which is important to calculate efficiently correlation functions on the ground state .",
    "\\iii ) contrary to the conventional believe we have shown that there are no basic difficulties to compute  off diagonal  correlation functions with green function monte carlo , using a simple forward walking technique ( sec[doublerun ] ) , which turned out to be very efficient for determining the order parameter in the hm .",
    "we have applied these methods to compute very accurately the ground state energy per site of the hm , the spin - spin structure factor and the antiferromagnetic order parameter , whose infinite size values are shown in the table ( [ tabfinal ] ) .",
    "we have obtained very good agreement with finite size spin wave theory , which allows a very well controlled finite size scaling ( see fig.[sqfig ] ) .",
    "we believe that the reported accuracy gives a very robust confirmation about the existence of af long range order in the 2d hm .",
    "we finally show in fig.([laco4 ] ) a comparison of our qmc prediction for @xmath0 with the available experimental data on the stechiometric la@xmath283cuo@xmath284 mott insulator for momenta close to the af wavevector : @xmath285 .",
    "the agreement is remarkably good considering also that    \\i ) the experiments have been performed at a temperature above the nel temperature , so that no true long range order exists , despite the very long correlation length.@xcite as a consequence , for a good comparison between experiments and theory , one should take into account the smearing of the @xmath286 function contribution at @xmath229 , to be added to the theorethical ground state prediction .",
    "\\ii ) there are no fitting parameters in the present comparison    therefore the copper oxygen planes of la@xmath283cuo4 , planes which become high temperature superconductors upon finite hole doping , are well described by the nearest neighbor heisenberg model .",
    "it is a pleasure to acknowledge useful discussions with c. lavalle , l. guidoni and e. tosatti .",
    "one of us ( ss ) wishes to thank the institute for nuclear physics of seattle for warm hospitality .",
    "this work is partly supported by pra htsc of the istituto nazionale di fisica della materia ( ss ) .",
    "in this appendix we follow the notations of sec.([biasc ] ) to describe an efficient implementation of the reconfiguration process needed to stabilize the proposed gfmc method .",
    "the new walkers @xmath287 after reconfiguration are chosen among the old ones @xmath111 , with probability @xmath288 .",
    "we divide the interval @xmath289 in @xmath21 subintervals with length @xmath288 from the leftmost to the rightmost as @xmath127 increases from @xmath290 to @xmath21 .",
    "then we generate @xmath21 pseudo - random numbers @xmath291 for @xmath292 and sort them , baring in mind that the index @xmath45 labels the walker @xmath287 after the reconfiguration .",
    "we save therefore the random permutation @xmath293 @xmath294 corresponding to the described sorting , permutation that determines @xmath295 .",
    "an efficient sorting algorithm takes the order of @xmath296 operations , thus is not time consuming .",
    "the next step p is to make a loop over the sorted index @xmath127 , giving monotonically increasing @xmath297 , and to select as new configuration @xmath298 the one @xmath172 , among the old configurations , such that @xmath297 belongs to the interval of length @xmath299 .",
    "note that the index function @xmath178 @xmath177 contains all the information required for the forward walking technique described in sec.([fwalking ] ) .    after the described process some of the old configurations may appear in many copies , while others disappear .",
    "this happens also if the distribution @xmath299 is uniform @xmath300 , yielding clearly some loss of information in the statistical process .",
    "a better way to implement the reconfiguration , without loosing information and without introducing any source of systematic error , is obtained by the following simple change , after the generation of the random permutation @xmath293 a new set of numbers uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath289 is defined : @xmath301 for @xmath302 , where @xmath303 is another pseudorandom number in @xmath289 .",
