    "in the search for signatures from the annihilation ( or the decay ) of dark matter particles , a gamma - ray line in the multi - gev energy range has long been considered a holy grail .",
    "given that , in the weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) paradigm , galactic dark matter is virtually at rest , the pair annihilation of two particles into a final state consisting of two photons would produce a monochromatic line with an energy exactly corresponding to the particle dark matter mass ( or to half its mass in the case of decay ) .",
    "the advent of the fermi gamma - ray large area telescope ( lat ) heralded promise of potentially delivering this smoking gun signal , which would then serve as a beacon for further searches to close in on a well - defined particle dark matter mass .    despite a null result presented by the lat collaboration in ref .",
    "@xcite , independent scholars analyzed the fermi data employing optimized signal - to - noise regions , unveiling a tantalizing excess localized around 130 gev and originating from regions including the galactic center @xcite .",
    "subsequent independent analyses confirmed the original claim , typically attributing an even larger level of confidence to the discovery of a monochromatic line in the fermi - lat data from the center of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "understandably , the discovery of the line spurred a great deal of interest in the community : a feature in the earth limb photon events at the same energy was found , albeit with a much lower statistical significance @xcite ; despite significant efforts in pinpointing possible instrumental or environmental effects that could explain the excess ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) , at present the line feature appears statistically significant enough to deserve serious consideration .    from a model - building and phenomenological standpoint",
    ", the 130 gev line poses interesting challenges : with default choices for the dark matter density profile in the galaxy , the required pair - annihilation cross section for dark matter ( at rest , i.e. at `` zero temperature '' ) into two photons is about @xmath2 , much larger than would be expected by suppressing by a factor @xmath3 the pair annihilation cross section expected for wimp thermal production in the early universe .",
    "even more problematic is the absence of a continuum gamma - ray signal accompanying the line in the region where the line is detected .",
    "this poses the question of how to suppress final states that would generously produce e.g.  neutral pions from hadronization showers of strongly interacting particles , or inverse compton or bremsstrahlung photons from charged leptons .",
    "simple paradigms for wimp dark matter fail at explaining the needed features of the 130 gev line .",
    "for example , neutralinos within the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) feature large suppressions in the pair annihilation into two photons with respect to any other final state , and the required large rate for neutralino pair - annihilation into two photons can not be accommodated with the right thermal relic abundance @xcite .",

    "in general , the properties associated with the neutralino lsp depend sensitively on the details of the various parameters involved ; this can be appreciated by considering the different benchmark points discussed in refs .",

    "the strategy outlined above is useful to automatically select the regions in the nmssm producing the tentatively observed 130 gev gamma - ray line , and provides an efficient way to study the properties of electroweak baryogenesis in these regions by exploring the remainder of the parameter space .",
    "note that we are not concerned with tuning or naturalness in this scenario , since we have narrowed in on this region by demanding consistency with the ( tentative ! ) observation of a gamma - ray line which we postulate to be associated with dark matter pair annihilation .",
    "we shall now use our suitably selected higgs and neutralino sectors to close in onto electroweak baryogenesis in regions of the nmssm producing a 130 gev line .",

    ", we take @xmath37 to be real ; since the lsp has only a very small wino component across the parameter space , and since the other neutralinos and charginos are significantly heavier than the lightest neutralino , the dm constraints will be largely unaffected by allowing @xmath37 to be complex .",
    "the higgs couplings are also insensitive to @xmath74",
    ".      indirect detection places important constraints on the parameter space in question . in considering @xmath90",

    "the lack of an excess of gamma - rays associated with this emission puts constraints on the branching ratio for neutralino pair - annihilation into , e.g. , @xmath92 @xcite . as mentioned above , however",
    ", one can generally dial in the mass splitting @xmath58 to obtain both @xmath93 @xmath51s and @xmath94 @xmath51s as required by fermi observations @xcite of the diffuse gamma ray background ( see e.g.  the benchmark point in table  [ table1 ] ) .",
    "additionally , neutralino annihilation into @xmath95 will receive a contribution at tree - level from the pseudoscalar channel ; however , this contribution also typically falls well beneath the @xmath96 @xmath51s bound from fermi by adjusting @xmath57 .",
    "consequently , this tuning allows one to satisfy all continuum gamma - ray constraints @xcite while reproducing the observed intensity of the 130 gev line , something that can not be done in the mssm .",
    "the parameter space we consider for electroweak baryogenesis can thus be dialed in to agree with indirect detection results without drastically affecting the details of the electroweak phase transition or the generation of the baryon asymmetry .",
    "similar reasoning applies to the dm thermal relic abundance . for @xmath97 to be a suitable thermally - produced dark matter candidate , it must be compatible with the bounds on the relic density from wmap7 @xcite : @xmath98 .",

    "therefore , as is the case for the zero - temperature cross - sections , by dialing in the detailed neutralino and pseudoscalar masses , as well as the @xmath71 mixing , one can typically achieve a total annihilation thermally averaged cross - section of @xmath108 @xmath51s required to obtain the correct relic density .",
    "previous studies @xcite have relied on a sizable higgsino component in the lsp to drive the relic density down",
    ". however , this requires small values of @xmath1 which are difficult to reconcile with the most recent direct detection constraints , except in the case of cancellations which can occur for negative @xmath1 as exploited in ref .",
    "@xcite ( we have found it difficult to achieve a strongly first - order ewpt consistent with the 130 gev line for the @xmath109 case , but it may still be possible ) . another possibility is to open a co - annihilation channel by e.g.  allowing a light stau with mass near 130 gev to drive the relic density down .",
    "light staus are not yet significantly constrained by lhc searches and , interestingly , they could provide an explanation of the enhanced higgs diphoton rate as observed by atlas , albeit for large @xmath25 ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "we do not pursue these avenues further , but emphasize that we find that the relic density ( and the zero - temperature neutralino annihilation cross - sections ) can be made to agree with observations in this scenario by tuning or other mechanisms that do not significantly affect the properties of the ewpt nor the calculation of the baryon asymmetry .",
    "consequently , we do not focus on the detailed bounds from indirect detection or the thermal relic abundance point - by - point in our present study of ewb in this scenario , but we do emphasize that these constraints can all be met in principle , as illustrated by a worked - out example in the ewpt benchmark point we show explicitly in table  [ table1 ] .      unlike the case of indirect detection and relic density constraints , the bounds from dm direct detection ( i.e. the scattering of the lightest neutralino off of nucleons ) do not depend sensitively on the details of the resonance , but rather on the composition of the lightest neutralino .",
    "this in turn depends on @xmath39 : larger values of @xmath39 require smaller values of @xmath1 to obtain @xmath78 gev and consequently enhance the spin - independent neutralino - proton cross section .",

    "while there are many independent constraints on this scenario , currently there remains a substantial amount of parameter space consistent with the gamma - ray line and in agreement with the various dark matter and particle physics constraints .",
    "here we have shown that the parameter space consistent with the fermi line in the nmssm is also promising for electroweak baryogenesis .",
    "in particular , the relatively large values of @xmath21 typically considered tend to bolster the cubic term in the finite - temperature effective potential in the direction of electroweak symmetry breaking , leading to a strongly first - order electroweak phase transition in parts of the parameter space . additionally , the moderate values of @xmath1 ensure that the singlet vev is not too far from the ew scale , again tending towards a strongly first - order transition .",
    "we illustrated this in sec .",
    "[ sec : ewpt ] by providing a benchmark point consistent with the 130 gev line and a strongly first - order ewpt , and in agreement with all other relevant phenomenological constraints . while we only studied in detail one particular point as a proof of principle",
    ", we expect a more systematic study of the nmssm parameter space to uncover many other regions consistent with the line and a strongly first - order ewpt",
    ".    not only does the parameter space consistent with the line support the possibility of a strongly first - order transition , it can also provide an efficient source for cp - violation that gives rise to the observed baryon - to - entropy ratio of the universe .",
    "resonant higgsino - gaugino sources can be very efficient here due to the moderate values of @xmath20 and @xmath1 required to produce the line .",
    "in particular , allowing for a cp - violating phase in @xmath37 does not strongly affect the line or the dark matter phenomenology , but it can produce the observed bau with @xmath197 small enough to be consistent with electric dipole measurements , as shown in sec .  [",
    "sec : ewb ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : results ] .",
    "while we focused on the higgsino - wino sources in the present study for the sake of illustration , similar resonant cp - violating sources arising from other interactions can be active in the same regions of parameter space by similar reasoning .",
    "for example , if one allows for @xmath39 to carry a complex phase , resonant bino - higgsino sources can be very efficient as well .",
    "this may be of particular interest in the case of negative @xmath1 whereby @xmath251 can be taken as low as 140  150 gev ( and thus potentially very close to this resonance ) while in agreement with direct detection constraints @xcite .",
    "a careful study of the effect of a cp - violating phase in @xmath39 on the line and dark matter properties would be necessary to assess whether such a scenario is possible , but we expect it is since edm measurements dictate that the cp - violating phase is necessarily small . also , singlino - higgsino sources can in principle be efficient in this region as well , provided a relative phase between @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xcite , again due to the moderate values of the singlino mass ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : singlino ] ) ) and @xmath1 in this scenario .",
    "these other sources would be especially important for points such as our ewpt benchmark which features a rather heavy wino but lighter bino and singlino",
    ".    an interesting feature of our scenario is that the relevant parameter space will be conclusively tested in the near future by modest improvements in various experimental efforts .",
    "the moderate values of @xmath1 we consider result in rather large spin - independent neutralino - nucleon cross - sections which continue to be probed by direct detection experiments .",
    "the relatively large values of @xmath21 , as required for a large @xmath252 , combined with the large @xmath23 and moderate values of @xmath22 necessary for a strongly first - order ewpt , tend towards a significant coupling of @xmath5 to e.g.  @xmath91 and so will be tested by modest improvements in indirect detection experiments .",
    "additionally , the cp - violating phase(s ) , required to source the left - handed charge density for the @xmath16 sphalerons , will be well within reach of various future edm experiments ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite for a related discussion ) .",
    "the whole scenario will also continue to be tested by ongoing measurements of higgs couplings and searches for other particles at the lhc .",
    "of course the viability of the 130 gev line scenario in the nmssm or any other sm extension hinges on the persistence of the line in the fermi data and on a dark matter interpretation of these results .",
    "if the line is indeed due to resonant dark matter annihilation , this work shows that the nmssm framework can potentially explain the origin of both the baryonic and dark matter in our universe .",

    "we present here the scalar mass terms used in the calculation of the finite - temperature effective potential . these are simply the second - derivatives of the full 10-parameter potential , but simplified such that only 3 of the parameters ( @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath0 ) are non - zero .",
