    "in the field of heavy hadrons , it is noticed that some experimental observations obviously deviate from our theoretical predictions , so definitely , such  anomalies \" need to be clarified .",
    "supposing the experimental measurements are right , there must be some loopholes in our present understanding of the nature , either there exists a contribution from new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) , or the concerned hadrons have exotic structure such as hybrid , multi - quark etc .",
    "it is believed that radiative decays on this aspect provide an ideal lab to testify the hadron structures and as well help to identify the quantum numbers for a newly observed resonances .",
    "even though , the reaction mechanism for radiative decays is free of strong interaction ( at tree level ) , the non - perturbative qcd effects are still involved in the hadronization of emerging hadrons , as well as the wavefunction of the parent hadron . to search for new physics or possible exotic components of the hadron , one must thoroughly study how the non - perturbative qcd affects the decay rates in a reasonable theoretical framework . in this work",
    ", we are going to derive the formulas for the radiative decays of @xmath0 and @xmath9 heavy mesons which are supposed to have regular @xmath10 structures , in the light front quark model ( lfqm ) . through a comparison of the theoretical predictions with data ,",
    "the consistency degree would reveal if the concerned hadron possesses the regular @xmath10 structure or has an exotic component .    during recent years several new particles such as @xmath5@xcite , @xmath11@xcite , @xmath12@xcite , @xmath13@xcite and @xmath14@xcite",
    "have been observed in experiments and re - confirmed as new resonances .",
    "however it is not easy to identify their inner structures , i.e. if the constituents of the resonances are indeed just @xmath15 and @xmath16 or with something else ( gluon or @xmath17 pair etc . ) .",
    "some of them are speculated as exotic states .",
    "the reasons may be twofold : one is their peculiar decay modes whereas the other is that the theoretical expectations on their excited states are not well consistent with data or even missing .",
    "for example when @xmath5 was announced it was considered as a molecular state or a tetraquark , however it may just be a regular @xmath18wave @xmath19 meson with @xmath20 as it appears in particle data book@xcite . because radiative decay is fully governed by the electromagnetic interaction ,",
    "the reaction mechanism is relatively simple and the emitted photon can be well measured in experiment , it may offer a good opportunity to justify the quantum numbers and constituent structure of the newly observed resonance .",
    "namely , one may check whether with the simple @xmath10 assignment the theoretical prediction agrees with data .    for @xmath18wave particles",
    "there are three degenerate states @xmath0 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 with the total intrinsic spin @xmath23 and one singlet @xmath9 with @xmath24 .",
    "it is well known that @xmath25 and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are triplets and singlet @xmath18wave charmonia respectively .    in this work",
    "we will calculate the rates of @xmath28 and @xmath29 in lfqm @xcite which has been successfully applied to evaluate rates of semileptonic and non - leptonic decays of @xmath30wave heavy mesons . for the @xmath18wave mesons ,",
    "the wave functions of @xmath0 , @xmath31 , @xmath9 and @xmath32 have been constructed and the leading feynman diagrams are simple , with them we are able to calculate the corresponding transition amplitudes .    since the branching ratio of @xmath33 is well measured , we first calculate @xmath34 in lfqm to fix the model parameters and check the validity degree of this approach , then with the formulas for the transition @xmath35 we estimate the rates of @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "these formulas can also be applied to study decays of other @xmath0 states .",
    "recently the spin singlets @xmath27 and @xmath38 attract intensive interests of both experimentalists and theorists@xcite . by the formulas for @xmath29 we calculate the widths of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the results can be compared with the data which will be available soon at the bes ii and future b - factory .",
    "this comparison definitely assures us if they are pure @xmath18wave heavy quarkonia .    after the introduction we derive the formulas for the transition @xmath35 and @xmath39 in section ii . then in sec .",
    "iii , we numerically evaluate the decay widths of @xmath33 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 and make some discussions . in the last section we give a brief summary and discussion .",
    "some notations and definitions of relevant quantities are collected in the attached appendix .",
    "in ref.@xcite chung studied various transitions and derived the corresponding amplitudes , for example , he determined the amplitude structure of @xmath40 . for transition @xmath29 @xcite",
    "a photon exists in the final states , thus the gauge invariance demands the transition amplitude to be in the form @xmath41 where @xmath15 and @xmath42 represent the momenta of the photon and daughter meson , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the polarizations of the vector - meson and photon respectively , and @xmath45 is the form factor which is what we are going to derive and numerically compute in this work . though the @xmath46 was not discussed in ref.@xcite , its amplitude structure is the same as eq.([p1 ] ) and it can be seen from analyzing the @xmath47 characters of the involved mesons .",
