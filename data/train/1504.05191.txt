    "the study of galaxy cluster mergers on star formation ( sf ) has made significant progress in recent years . while the relationship between morphological type and clustercentric distance and local density has been well - known for decades ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "in general , star formation rate ( sfr ) declines rapidly since @xmath4 , and several authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have considered this for galaxy clusters as a function of redshift and cluster richness .",

    "other studies report no effect from merging on cluster galaxies , and some suggest that sf is quenched by the interactions : for example , a168 @xcite , a2356 @xcite , post - starburst galaxies in a3921 @xcite , rxcj 2308.3 - 0211 @xcite , a1750 @xcite , and a1664 @xcite .",

    "we discuss our interpretations in  [ sec : discussionsec ] .    throughout our analysis",
    "we assume a standard cosmology of @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .",
    "our galaxy cluster sample is taken from , who measure the relaxation states of 2092 clusters in the redshift range @xmath10 .",
    "these clusters are from the catalog of @xcite , a collection of 132,684 clusters from the sdss dr8 @xcite .",
    "our optical data is from the sdss dr9 @xcite , from which we obtain photometric and , when available , spectroscopic redshifts ; _ ugriz _ magnitudes ; and _ k_-corrections .",
    "mid - infrared data for determining sf properties is from the allwise catalog @xcite , which supplies magnitudes in four bands centered at 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 , and 22 @xmath11 m ( hereafter , w1 , w2 , w3 , and w4 ) .    to determine cluster membership , we begin by following the procedure described in , to which we direct the reader for details . in short ,",
    "they select member galaxies based on photometric absolute magnitude , redshift , and projected distance from the cluster center .",
    "however , we found that this method includes many background galaxies found above the clusters red sequence in @xmath12 versus @xmath13 space , where @xmath13 is the evolution - correction @xmath14 _",
    "r_-band absolute magnitude and the superscript 0.1 denotes a _ k_-correction to a redshift of 0.1 .",
    "we therefore remove all galaxies at @xmath15 , about 6.7% of the galaxy sample , which is 1.52 magnitudes above the red sequence as we observe for our clusters and as identified by , for example , @xcite or @xcite .",

    "r_-band luminosity within 1 mpc as described in @xcite .",
    "since our sample is flux - limited , we must correct for the fact that galaxies at a given luminosity are increasingly difficult to detect at increasing redshift .",
    "thus , we include only galaxies brighter than a certain limit in @xmath13 , which is determined by the absolute magnitudes of the faintest galaxies seen at the highest redshift of our sample .",
    "however , above @xmath17 , imposing this absolute magnitude limit eliminates too many star - forming ( and therefore generally fainter ) galaxies for a sf analysis to be effective .",
    "therefore , we limit our sample of clusters to those at @xmath6 and galaxies to those with @xmath18 . at @xmath19 , this limit corresponds to an apparent magnitude of approximately 20.4 .",
    "we further restrict our sample to only those clusters with a w3 completeness level of at least 80% , as explained in greater detail in ",

    "we identify active galaxies via their detection in the wise 12 @xmath11 m band ; we select objects with a signal - to - noise ratio greater than 3 as defined in the wise data processing pipeline .",
    "however , more nearby clusters contain a higher fraction of 12 @xmath11m - detected galaxies than distant clusters due to lower luminosity limits .",
    "to correct for this , we restrict our definition of detection to include only those galaxies whose 12 @xmath11 m luminosities ( @xmath24 ) are complete across all redshifts of our sample .",

    "this @xmath24 limit is further complicated by the internal wise completeness as a function of flux density . at @xmath19 ,",

    "whose wise depth is at least 11 frames , this w3 flux density corresponds to a completeness of at least 90% .",

    ", we still correct the number of star - forming galaxies in our sample to account for the missing galaxies . to do this",
    ", we adjust the number of detected star - forming galaxies by the percent completeness at each galaxy s flux density , determined via interpolation of the internal w3 completeness curves . to avoid relying too heavily on this completeness correction",
    ", we remove from our sample all clusters containing any galaxies whose flux density corresponds to a w3 completeness of less than 20% .    to distinguish between star - forming galaxies and agn ,",
    "many past studies have employed cuts in wise color space ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we calculate rest - frame w1 and w2 magnitudes by assuming that these bands are dominated by emission from the rayleigh - jeans tail of the galaxies seds .",
    "since rayleigh - jeans flux is proportional to @xmath39 , we correct the measured w1 and w2 fluxes by @xmath40 to determine rest - frame fluxes and magnitudes .    when calculating the sf fraction for each cluster , we take into account the fact that the cluster membership procedure of imposes liberal limits on their photometric redshifts ( photo-__z__s ) that include a number of foreground and background galaxies that are not cluster members .",
    "indeed , for each cluster , include galaxies within a photo-_z _ slice of @xmath41 . for a cluster at @xmath14 , for example",
    ", this corresponds to a comoving distance of over 300 mpc between the close and far edges of the cluster .    to correct for the large width of this redshift bin",
    ", we estimate the number of foreground and background galaxies included as cluster members , and subtract these galaxies as part of our sf fraction calculation .",
    "to do this , we assume that the field just outside , and in the same redshift range as , the clusters will contain comparable numbers of foreground and background galaxies as the clusters lines of sight .",
    "we calculate sf fraction within both @xmath16 and @xmath20 , and the region outside a cluster is defined as between @xmath20 and @xmath42 .",
    "we define subtracted sf fraction as    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is number of galaxies ; the superscripts denote galaxies inside ( @xmath45 ) or outside ( @xmath46 ) the cluster ; the subscripts distinguish between number of star - forming galaxies ( @xmath47 ) or total number of galaxies ( @xmath48 ) ; and the multiplication by @xmath49 normalizes the area outside the cluster to the area inside .",
    "@xmath50 is corrected for internal w3 completeness , while @xmath51 is not .",
    "the galaxies outside the clusters are selected in the same way as the cluster galaxies .",
    "this subtraction , then , effectively cancels the potential contamination of the sf fraction caused by foreground and background galaxies .      to quantify their clusters dynamical states , assign each cluster a relaxation parameter @xmath52 via three symmetry tests of",
    "the smoothed _",
    "r_-band surface brightness maps of the galaxies within @xmath53 .",
    "we explain these tests briefly here ; for more details , see .",
    "first , the asymmetry factor @xmath54 quantifies the rotational symmetry of a cluster .",
    "second , the ridge flatness @xmath55 utilizes the radial light profile steepness in many angular directions , with unrelaxed clusters exhibiting flatter profiles .",
    "finally , the normalized deviation @xmath56 quantifies the smoothed optical map s deviation from the two - dimensional elliptical king model .    to determine the final relaxation parameter @xmath52 of each cluster , first define a plane in the three - dimensional space of @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 that optimizes the separation between relaxed and unrelaxed clusters as determined by x - ray imaging .",
    "@xmath52 is defined as the distance from this plane .",
    "positive values of @xmath52 indicate relaxed clusters , while negative values of @xmath52 denote unrelaxed clusters .",
    "show that this relaxation parameter is reasonably well correlated with dynamical parameters of clusters derived from x - ray data , such as concentration , centroid shift , power ratio , and cooling time .",
    "in figure  [ fig : sffracvsgammafig ] , we plot the subtracted sf fraction within @xmath20 , as discussed in  [ sec : sfsec ] , as a function of relaxation parameter @xmath52 .",
    "notice that @xmath52 , and thus relaxation , decreases to the right .",
    "each light blue point represents a cluster .",
    "the dark blue triangles represent the sf fraction of all cluster galaxies in each bin in @xmath52 , and the errors on these points are calculated via a bootstrap resampling of the galaxies in each bin .",
    "each bin measures the total sf fraction of all galaxies in that bin .",

    "we have not plotted @xmath58 of clusters whose sf fractions are slightly above 0.2 and whose @xmath52 values span the plotted range , and the legend box obscures a small number of points . in general , less relaxed clusters exhibit more sf . ]",
    "the slope of the relation is @xmath59 , a significance of about @xmath60 , which is calculated as the formal uncertainty on the linear chi - square fit .",
    "this indicates that a weak but significant correlation exists between sf in and decreased relaxation of clusters .",
    "this correlation is confirmed by spearman s rank test : the binned values produce a correlation with @xmath61 and @xmath62 , indicating a strong , significant correlation .",
    "additionally , spearman s test on the individual cluster values produces a correlation with @xmath63 and @xmath64 , indicating a weak but significant correlation .    as another test of this relationship between sf and relaxation",
    ", we also calculate the total sf fraction in all relaxed clusters ( those with @xmath65 ) and in all unrelaxed clusters ( those with @xmath66 ) .",
    "we find that the subtracted sf fraction in unrelaxed clusters , @xmath2 , is higher than the sf fraction in relaxed clusters , @xmath3 .",
    "the significance of this difference between unrelaxed and relaxed clusters is approximately @xmath67 . for comparison ,",
    "the sf fraction for all field galaxies at @xmath68 is approximately @xmath69 . over this large sample of clusters , then , a more unrelaxed state is correlated with higher cluster sf .    as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : sfsec ] , we also perform this analysis only using galaxies within @xmath16 .",
    "we find a slope of @xmath70 and subtracted sf fractions of @xmath71 for unrelaxed clusters and @xmath72 for relaxed clusters .",
    "these results are similar in value and significance to those above and produce the same conclusions .",
    "furthermore , the observed correlation remains when using the means or medians of the cluster sf fractions in each bin .",
    "the significance of the correlation is slightly lower , but this could be due to other factors that affect sf in clusters ( e.g. , merger history , as discussed in  [ sec : discussionsec ] . )",
    "in this section , we discuss several tests we perform to check the validity of our sf calculation methods , and to compare our results to those in , who found that the sf fraction in clusters with substructure , @xmath73 , is higher than that in clusters without substructure , @xmath74 .",
    "this result agrees qualitatively with ours , and we discuss the implications of this in  [ sec : discussionsec ] .",
    "however , the sf fractions in our unrelaxed and relaxed clusters are lower , and the absolute difference between these fractions is smaller , than those in . in the following ,",
    "we argue that these differences are expected and a consequence of the membership selection and sf identification methods used in the current paper .",

    ", we find statistically similar sf fractions between tests employing both spectroscopic and photometric membership methods , confirming that these methods achieve similar results .",

    "next , we note that the results from these verification tests are less significant than the main results of this work due to the smaller number of galaxies in the sample and to the stricter absolute magnitude and redshift limits .",
    "additionally , comparing the results using the two membership selection methods shows how applying photometric membership criteria results in lower significance than using spectroscopic membership methods .",
    "this illustrates the advantage of gathering a large cluster sample when utilizing photometric data , as we have done in this work .",
    "the sf fractions from this work and from the discussed verification tests are lower than those from , summarized in row 8 .",
    "this is due to the use of both wise data for sf calculations and the relatively high @xmath24 limit necessary for a fair discussion of the comparisons above . to illustrate this point",

    "this limit is determined from the current work s galaxies at @xmath5 and is complete to this redshift .",
    "as expected , the resulting sf fractions are much more similar to those from .",
    "finally , we note that the field sf fractions ( column 11 ) differ for different cluster samples for two reasons .",
    "one , optically - brighter galaxies , like those included in the tests in rows 3 through 6 , are less likely to be star - forming .",
    "two , the lower luminosity limit used in the test in row 7 selects more star - forming galaxies .",
    "these verification tests confirm that the methods used in this work  utilizing wise data in a photometrically - selected sample of galaxies to calculate subtracted sf fractions ",
    "produce conclusions consistent with the methods used in , which are based on more robust spectroscopic determinations of sf and cluster membership , but for a much smaller sample of clusters .",
    "we find a higher fraction of star - forming galaxies in less - relaxed clusters than more - relaxed clusters .",
    "this result agrees with the findings of , who also found a correlation between cluster sf and cluster dynamical state .",
    "this is especially promising because these studies measure sf and cluster relaxation with independent methods .",
    "in particular , to determine sf properties , used optical spectroscopic data from sdss , while our study uses infrared data from wise . furthermore , measured substructure out to several virial radii using two- and three - dimensional statistical tests from @xcite , while our study uses surface brightness symmetry tests out to @xmath90 from .",
    "the fact that both studies arrive at the same conclusion strengthens the result that , in general , more dynamically active clusters exhibit higher amounts of sf .    as in ,",
    "we propose two possible explanations for these results .",
    "first , unrelaxed clusters could exhibit higher sf fractions because the cluster dynamics causing the clusters to appear unrelaxed ( i.e. , merging ) could be actively enhancing cluster sf . however , we prefer a second explanation , that unrelaxed clusters are still in the process of forming and thus represent a transitional state between the field environment and a relaxed cluster environment . since field galaxies , in general , exhibit higher sf than cluster galaxies , a transitional state could exhibit sf values between those of these two environments .    a possible avenue for distinguishing between these explanations and for decreasing the large scatter in our observed sf fractions involves determining merger histories of our clusters , since clusters at different stages of merging can exhibit different sf fractions for similar apparent relaxation states ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "analytical calculations ( e.g. , the radial infall model of @xcite ) and simulations utilizing clusters velocities and masses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can be used to estimate merger histories of many clusters .",
