    "properties of systems with long range interactions are to a large extent only poorly understood although they concern a wide range of problems in physics . recently",
    ", the disclosure of new methodologies to approach the study of these systems has revealed its importance also in a trans - disciplinary perspective ( astrophysics , nuclear physics , plasmas physics , bose - einstein condensates , atomic clusters , hydrodynamics , ... ) .",
    "the main challenge is represented by the construction of a thermodynamic treatment of systems with long range forces and by the understanding of analogies and differences among the numerous domains of applications .",
    "some promising results in this direction have been recently obtained in the attempt of combining tools developed in the framework of standard statistical mechanics with concepts and methods of dynamical systems . particularly arduous , but very exciting , is the understanding of phase transitions ( negative specific heat , non extensive thermodynamics , ... ) for such systems as well as all the aspects related to non - equilibrium phenomena and their description in terms of dynamical concepts ( self - consistent chaos , slow relaxation , formation and role of structures , ... ) .",
    "finally this fundamental and methodological study should help us to detect the depth and the origin of the analogies found in the different domains mentioned above or on the contrary emphasize their specificities .",
    "in particular , we would like to put a special emphasis on bose einstein condensation ( bec ) which could be the main field of applications , since experiments and theoretical ideas have reached an impressive quality in the last decade . in that domain , many inequivalences between ensembles have been reported and should be clarified . moreover , long range interactions in bec have opened very exciting new perspectives to consider bec as a model for other systems .",
    "the methods to describe a given system of @xmath0 particles interacting via a gravitational potential in @xmath1 are dramatically dependent on the value @xmath0 . if newton showed the exact solution for @xmath2 , and one can expect to get a numerical solution in the range @xmath3 , the results are clearly out of reach for a larger number of particles .",
    "in addition , it is clear that the knowledge of the evolution of the different trajectories is completely useless , since it is well known that these systems are chaotic as soon as @xmath0 is greater than two .",
    "therefore , one needs to get a _",
    "analysis , in order to get insights in the thermodynamical properties  @xcite of the system under study .",
    "however , such statistical study leads immediately to unexpected behaviors for physicists used to neutral gases , plasmas or atomic lattices . the underlying reason is directly related to the long range of the interaction , and more precisely to the non additivity of the system .    to avoid misunderstandings ,",
    "let us first clarify the definition of _ extensivity _ with respect to _",
    "additivity_. a thermodynamic variable , like the energy or the entropy , would be extensive , if it is proportional to the number of elements , once the intensive variables are kept constant . to be more precise ,",
    "let us consider the following hamiltonian @xmath4 where the spins @xmath5 sit on a one - dimensional lattice labeled by @xmath6 . without the @xmath7 prefactor",
    "such a hamiltonian would have an ill defined thermodynamic limit .",
    "this is correctly restored by applying the kac prescription  @xcite , within which the potential is rescaled by an appropriate volume dependent factor , here proportional to @xmath0 since the lattice is one - dimensional : such a hamiltonian is therefore extensive .",
    "let us note in passing that this regularization is not always accepted .",
    "in cases with a kinetic term , such a regularization corresponds to a renormalization of the time scale .    on the contrary",
    ", this hamiltonian is not additive .",
    "indeed , let us divide a system schematically pictured in fig .",
    "[ additivite ] , in two equal parts .",
    "in addition , one considers the particular case with all spins in the left part are equal to 1 , whereas all spin in the right part are equal to -1 .",
    "it is clear that the energy of the two different parts , will be @xmath8 .",
    "however , if one computes the total energy of the system , one gets @xmath9 .",
    "it is therefore clear that such a system is not additive , since one can not considers that @xmath10 , even approximately .",
    "the energy of the interface , usually neglected , is clearly of the order of the energies of the two different parts : the system is not additive .",
    "the underlying reason is that hamiltonian  ( [ hamiladditi ] ) is long ( strictly speaking infinite ) range , since every spin interact with all others : moreover , as the interaction is not dependent on the distance between spins , this is a mean - field model .",
    "this example is further elaborated in  @xcite .",
    "this non additivity has strong consequences in the construction of the canonical ensemble .",
    "once the microcanonical ensemble has been defined , the usual construction of this ensemble is usually taught as follows . the probability that system @xmath11 has an energy @xmath12 and system @xmath13 has an energy @xmath14 is proportional to @xmath15 , where the number of states of a system with a given energy @xmath16 , @xmath17 , is related to the entropy via the classical boltzmann formula @xmath18 ( we omit the @xmath19 factor for the sake of simplicity ) . using the additivity of the energy , and considering the case where system @xmath11 is much smaller than system @xmath13",
    ", one can expand the term @xmath20 , as shown in the following different steps @xmath21 where @xmath22 .",
    "one ends up with the usual canonical distribution .",
    "it is clear that additivity is crucial to justify  ( [ derivdistcanon ] ) , which means that non additive system will have a very peculiar behavior if there are in contact with a thermal reservoir .",
    "this is one of the topic discussed in this paper , and in numerous contributions in this book .      to define now systems with long range interactions ,",
    "let us consider the potential energy for a given particle , situated in the center of a homogeneous sphere with radius @xmath23 .",
    "we will omit at this stage the interactions of the particles situated in the neighborhood of the particles by forgetting particles located in the sphere of radius @xmath24 , where @xmath25 as shown in fig .",
    "[ sphere ] . the reason will be explained in the following subsection .",
    ", except the closest ones located in the sphere of radius  @xmath24 . ]",
    "if one considers that particles interact via a potential energy proportional to @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the key - parameter defining the range of interaction , we obtain in the three dimensional space @xmath28_\\varepsilon^r\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the particle density .",
    "when increasing the radius @xmath23 , the contribution due to the surface of the sphere , @xmath30 , could be neglected when @xmath31 , but diverges if @xmath32 . in the latter case ,",
    "surface effects are important and therefore additivity is not fulfilled .",
    "if one generalizes this definition to long range systems in @xmath33 dimensions , one easily shows that energy will not be additive if the potential energy behaves at long distance as @xmath34 mean - field models as hamiltonian  ( [ hamiladditi ] ) corresponds to the value @xmath35 , since the interaction does not depend on the distance .",
    "there are therefore not additive as shown in section  ( [ theproblemofadditivity ] ) .",
    "et al _ consider  @xcite such a mean field model : the blume - emery - griffith ( beg ) model with infinite range interactions .",
    "the gravitational problem , which is at the origin of this study , and corresponds to @xmath36 in three dimensions , clearly belongs to this category , but presents also additional difficulties .",
    "this problem is particularly tedious because , in addition to the non additivity due to long range character , such a system needs a careful regularization at short distances to avoid collapse . to be more specific ,",
    "let us consider the configurational partition function of a system of @xmath0 particles @xmath37 where one notes @xmath38 the gravitational potential energy , @xmath39 the inverse of the temperature and @xmath40 the volume of the system .",
    "is represented by the solid curve , whereas the dotted one shows the regularized potential energy to avoid gravitational collapse . ]    from the shape of the potential energy depicted in fig .",
    "[ courtedistance ] , one clearly see that @xmath41 will diverge if all particles collapse towards the same point .",
    "this difficulty arises because the potential energy is _ not bounded from below _ as for a lennard - jones or a morse potential .",
    "this effect is of course physically forbidden by the pauli principle .",
    "however , to avoid the use of quantum mechanics , the usual trick is to introduce an add - hoc cut - off .",
    "the potential is therefore `` regularized '' by introducing the value @xmath42 , shown in fig .",
    "[ courtedistance ] .",
    "thus , the inequality @xmath43 allows easily to find a finite upper bound for the configurational partition function @xmath44 , where @xmath40 is the volume of the system .",
    "however , there is a third difficulty in the case of gravitational interaction : the system is open , i.e. without boundary , strictly speaking . in the microcanonical ensemble ,",
    "the number of states @xmath45 will diverge if the system is not confined .",
    "this divergence is actually not restricted to the gravitational interaction but would also occur if one considers a perfect gas in an infinite volume .",
    "however , one considers of course always a gas in a finite domain , i.e. in a finite volume . this is not any more possible for the gravitational interaction where the system is clearly infinite .    despite these additional difficulties ,",
    "the astrophysics community has obtained an impressive quantity of results in this domain .",
    "thanu padmanabhan  @xcite describes several remarkable features , both for isolated gravitating systems as well as for systems undergoing nonlinear clustering in an expanding background cosmology .",
    "the emphasis is on general results and he brings out the inter - relationships of this subject with topics in fluid mechanics , condensed matter and renormalization group theory .",
    "similarly , pierre - henri chavanis  @xcite presents how the structure and the organization of stellar systems ( globular clusters , elliptical galaxies , ... ) in astrophysics can be understood in terms of a statistical mechanics for a system of particles in gravitational interaction .",
    "finally , eddie cohen and iaroslav ispolatov  @xcite consider the related gravitational - like collapse of particles with an attractive @xmath46 potential .",
    "using mean field continuous integral equation , they determine the saddle - point density profile that extremizes the entropy functional . for all @xmath47 , a critical energy is determined below which the entropy of the system exhibits a discontinuous jump .",
    "however a growing scientific community has recently begun to tackle this problem with different viewpoints .",
    "one of the fascinating aspects of this problem is that , in addition to gravitating systems , it concerns a large variety of systems that we would like to discuss briefly in the following section .      :",
    "rarefied plasmas share many properties with collisionless stellar systems , and in particular that the mean field of the system is more important than the fields of individual nearby particles . here again , the coulomb force is of long range character .",
    "however , there is a fundamental difference between plasmas and gravitation .",
    "plasmas have both positive and negative charges , so that they are neutral on large scales and can form static homogeneous equilibria ; on the contrary , gravitating systems can never form static homogeneous equilibria .",
    "this so - called debye screening explains why many techniques of plasma physics can not be transferred immediately .",
    "elskens  @xcite and diego del castillo negrete  @xcite present some of their results in the framework of plasma physics .      :",
    "two - dimensional incompressible hydrodynamics is another important case where the interaction is long range .",
    "indeed , the streamfunction @xmath48 is related to the modulus of the vorticity @xmath49 , via the poisson equation @xmath50 . using the green s function technique ,",
    "one easily finds that the solution is @xmath51 where @xmath52 depends on @xmath53 , but @xmath54 , when @xmath55 .",
    "the kinetic energy being conserved by the euler equation ( dissipativeless ) , it is straightforward to compute it on the domain @xmath53 , with boundary  @xmath56 , @xmath57 since @xmath58 on @xmath56 .",
    "this emphasizes that one gets a logarithmic interaction .",
    "the analogy is even more clear if one approximates the vorticity field by point vortices @xmath59 , located at @xmath60 , with a given circulation  @xmath61 .",
    "the energy of the system reads now @xmath62 the interaction among vortices has a logarithmic character , which corresponds to @xmath35 .",
    "pierre - henri chavanis  @xcite studies carefully the analogy between the statistical of large - scale vortices in two - dimensional turbulence and self - gravitating systems .",
    "this analogy concerns not only the equilibrium states , i.e. the formation of large - scale structures , but also the relaxation towards equilibrium and the statistics of fluctuations .",
    "diego del castillo negrete  @xcite discusses also his results in the framework of hydrodynamics .",
    "dielectrics and diamagnets in an external electric or magnetic field exhibit a shape dependent thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "this is due to the marginal decay of the potential energy @xmath63 for systems of dipoles .",
    "there is some approach to the solution of this problem only in zero field and in the absence of spontaneous ferromagnetism @xcite .",
    "this is a border case for the long - range interactions , but it deserves a special attention .",
    "let us examine analytical solutions for the plane stress and displacement fields around the tip of a slit - like plane crack in an ideal hookean continuum solid .",
    "the classic approach to any linear elasticity problem of this sort involves the search for a suitable `` stress function '' that satisfies the so - called biharmonic equation @xmath64 where @xmath48 is the airy stress function , in accordance with appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "the deformation energy density is then defined as @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the fracture stress field around the tip , whereas @xmath24 is the deformation field . considering a crack - width @xmath67 in a two - dimensional material and using the exact muskhelishvili s solution  @xcite ,",
    "one otbains the elastic potential energy due to the crack @xmath68 where @xmath16 is the young modulus , @xmath69 the stress field at infinity , @xmath70 the poisson coefficient and @xmath71 the distance to the tip : the elasticity equation in the bulk of solids leads therefore , again , to a border case for the long - range interactions since @xmath72 in two dimensions .",
    "it appears that , despite of its engineering applications , the dynamics of this non conservative system has been very little studied , presumably because of its long range character .",
    "in addition , in such a two dimensional material , the presence of several fractures could exhibit very interesting screening effects .",
    "llll interactions & @xmath27 & @xmath73 & comments + & & & + & 1 & 1/3 & + & 1 & 1/3 & + & 3 & 1 & + & 0 & 0 & + & 1 & 1 & + & & & + & & & + nuclei & & & + & & & +    [ apptab1b ]      in addition to large systems where the interactions is truly long range , one should consider small systems where the range of the interactions is of the order of the size of the system . in these cases ,",
    "the system would not be additive either and many similarities will be encountered .",
    "phase transitions are universal properties of interacting matter which have been widely studied in the thermodynamic limit of _ infinite _ systems . however ,",
    "in many physical situations this limit is not accessible and phase transitions should be considered from a more general point of view .",
    "this is for example the case for some microscopic or mesoscopic systems : atomic clusters can melt , small drops of quantum fluids may undergo a bose - einstein condensation or a super - fluid phase transition , dense hadronic matter is predicted to merge in a quark and gluon plasma phase while nuclei are expected to exhibit a liquid - gas phase transition . for all these systems",
    "the experimental issue is how to characterize a phase transition in a _",
    "finite _ system .",
    "philippe chomaz and francesca gulminelli  @xcite , discusses results from nuclear physics as well as from clusters physics .",
    "in particular , they introduce a possible definition of first order phase transitions in finite systems based on topology anomalies @xcite of the event distribution in the space of observations .",
    "this generalizes the definitions based on the curvature anomalies of thermodynamical potentials and provides a natural definition of order parameters .",
    "the new definitions are constructed to be directly operational from the experimental point of view .",
    "finally , they show why without the thermodynamic limit or at phase - transitions , the systems do not have a single peaked distribution in phase space .    in a closely related contribution ,",
    "dieter gross  @xcite makes the statement , that the microcanonical ensemble with boltzmann s principle @xmath74 is the only proper basis to describe the equilibrium of a closed `` small '' system .",
    "phase - transitions are linked to convex ( upwards bending ) intruders of the entropy , where the canonical ensemble defined by the laplace transform to the intensive variables becomes multi - modal , non - local , and violates the basic conservation laws .",
    "the one - to - one mapping of the legendre transform being lost , gross claims that it is all possible without invoking the thermodynamic limit , extensivity , or concavity of the entropy .",
    "following the example exhibited long time ago by hertel and thirring  @xcite , it is striking that these systems could lead to inequivalences between microcanonical , canonical or grand canonical ensembles . in this book , the first example is given by barr _",
    "et al _  @xcite who present the blume - emery - griffiths ( beg ) model which allows a deep understanding of the fundamental reason why this happens .",
    "they studied the spin-1 beg model both in the canonical and in the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "the canonical phase diagram exhibits a first order and a continuous transition lines which join at a tricritical point .",
    "it is shown that in the region where the canonical transition is first order , the microcanonical ensemble yields a phase diagram which differs from the canonical one .",
    "in particular it is found that the microcanonical phase diagram exhibits energy ranges with negative specific heat and temperature jumps at the transition energies .",
    "the global phase diagrams in the two ensembles and their multicritical behavior are calculated and compared .",
    "pierre - henri chavanis  @xcite shows similar features in self - gravitating systems where canonical and microcanonical tricritical points do not coincide either , as shown in fig .",
    "[ chavanis ] in the framework of self - gravitating fermions .",
    "let us emphasize that this property survives to the introduction of a finite cut - off instead of quantum degeneracy as discussed by chavanis .",
    "this fact produces striking phenomena in the microcanonical ensemble , since it may result in a negative specific heat region , as was emphasized  @xcite by eddington in 1926 and then discussed by lynden - bell  @xcite . a first remark on the possibility of having negative specific heat in the microcanonical ensemble can even be found in the seminal paper on statistical mechanics by j.c .",
    "maxwell  @xcite .",
    "thirring  @xcite has finally clarified the point by showing that the paradox disappears if one realizes that only the microcanonical specific heat could be negative .",
    "indeed , in the canonical ensemble the mean value of the energy of a system with different energy levels @xmath75 is @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the partition function .",
    "it is then straightforward to compute the specific heat @xmath78 this clearly shows that the canonical specific heat is always positive .",
    "notice also that this condition is true for systems of any size , regardless of whether a proper thermodynamic limit exists or not .",
    "this is not the case if the energy is constant as shows the simplified following derivation for the example of interacting self - gravitating systems . using the virial theorem for such particles @xmath79",
    "one gets that the total energy @xmath80 as the kinetic energy @xmath81 is by definition proportional of the temperature one gets that @xmath82 loosing its energy , the system is becoming hotter .",
    "it is important at this stage to make a short comment on the maxwell construction , usually taught in the framework of the van der waals liquid - gas transition .",
    "the existence of a negative specific heat region corresponds to a convex intruder in the entropy - energy curve , as shown in fig .",
    "[ concavite ] .",
    "when the interactions are short range , the system will phase separate in two parts , corresponding to the two phases 1 and 2 with a molar fraction @xmath83 , so that the free energy @xmath84 is lower than the original free energy .",
    "this is clearly possible if the energy cost of the interface is proportional to the surface whereas the energy gain is proportional to the volume of the phase .",
    "however , this is not any more possible when the interactions are long range since , on one hand , it is not straightforward to define a phase and , moreover , the system is not additive .",
    "the maxwell construction has to be redefined in this new framework .     as a function of the energy @xmath16 with a convex intruder : the solid curve corresponds to the microcanonical result , whereas the dashed line to the canonical one . ]",
    "let us note that the microcanonical entropy as a function of the energy and of the order parameter generically leads to the landscape presented in fig .",
    "[ embleme ] .",
    "the projection for the critical points of the surface onto the entropy - energy plane produces the well known `` swallowtail '' catastrophe  @xcite , depicted on the right of the figure .",
    "this concept of negative specific heat is now widely accepted in the astrophysical community , and was popularized in particular by hawking  @xcite in 1974 , with some esoteric applications to black holes .",
    "the caloric curve of self - gravitating fermions derived by chavanis and shown in fig .",
    "[ chavanis ] emphasizes such negative specific heat branch : the dotted branch is one example .",
    "similarly one gets negative specific heat branch in the beg model proposed by barr _",
    "et al _  @xcite . in the canonical ensemble , they correspond to local maxima or saddle point of the corresponding free energy ; it is the constraint of keeping the energy constant that stabilizes these canonical unstable states in the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "experimental groups have recently claimed signatures of negative specific heats in small systems .",
    "the first one corresponds to nuclear fragmentation  @xcite , even if the authors use prudently the word `` indication '' of negative specific heat .",
    "the latter being inferred from the event by event study of energy fluctuations from au + au collisions . however , the signatures correspond to indirect measurements .    in the clusters community ,",
    "two experimental groups have very recently reported negative specific heat .",
    "the first system  @xcite correspond to atomic sodium clusters , namely na@xmath85 and the negative microcanonical specific heat has been found near the solid to liquid transition . the cluster ion are produced in a gas aggregation source and then thermalized with helium gas of controlled temperature .",
    "accelerated thanks to the charge in a mass spectrometer , they are finally irradiated by a laser to determine the energy from the evaporation of several atoms after laser irradiation , also called photofragmentation . however , the control of equilibrium is as always the key point and therefore the evaluation of the temperature seems to be questionable , in particular since the temperature could not be constant during the motion of the ions .    in the lyon s molecular cluster experiment  @xcite , with h@xmath86 , the energy and the temperature",
    "are determined from the size distribution of fragments after collision of the cluster with a helium projectile . to simplify the method ,",
    "the larger the ratio of small fragments versus large ones , the larger is the temperature determined using the bonasera et al procedure  @xcite .",
    "the caloric curve reported  @xcite shows a plateau .",
    "work along this line is in progress and seems to show a negative specific heat region .",
    "constantino tsallis , andrea rapisarda , vito latora and fulvio baldovin  @xcite review the generalized non - extensive statistical mechanics formalism and its implications for different physical systems .",
    "the original very interesting idea is to generalize boltzmann s entropy by defining @xmath87 where @xmath88 . using either the lhopital rule or a first order expansion of the term @xmath89 in power of @xmath90 , one",
    "immediately notices that @xmath91 i.e. the well known shannon entropy , known to be equivalent to the boltzmann s one .    however , for @xmath90 different from 1 , this generalized entropy @xmath92 is non additive , and one gets @xmath93 they illustrate in particular its application and the meaning of the entropic index  @xmath90 for conservative and dissipative low - dimensional maps .",
    "they also report on non boltzmann - gibbs behavior  @xcite and hindrance of relaxation for hamiltonian systems with long - range interaction , where fingerprints of the generalized statistics have recently emerged .",
    "this very interesting proposal  @xcite had however until now no strong foundations and many physicists were not ready to admit that the exponential boltzmann distribution of states is at equilibrium only a particular case of a generalized distributions , with power tails .",
    "dieter gross  @xcite in particular makes different comments to this point . on the contrary , tsallis et al",
    "emphasize also different situations were the boltmann - gibbs behavior is clearly not appropriate .",
    "recently , beck and cohen  @xcite showed that considering different statistics with large fluctuations , one can obtain generalized results , called superstatistics , with the tsallis formalism being presumably so far the most relevant example .",
    "moreover , baldovin and robledo worked out  @xcite exactly the @xmath90 indices for the generalized largest lyapunov exponent proposed by tsallis .",
    "this an important step toward the derivation of a complete theory which , in particular , should help to understand the limits of its applications .",
    "an essential peculiarity of these physical systems , and of some of their simplified models , is that a classical system of particles with long range interactions will display strong non - equilibrium features .",
    "dynamics is typically chaotic and self - consistent , since all particles give a contribution to the field acting on each of them : one calls this _ self - consistent chaos_. numerous physical systems fall in this category : galactic dynamics , dynamics of a plasma , vorticity dynamics , ....    it is therefore essential to study the thermodynamic stability of these systems and in particular to understand the formation of structures trough _",
    "instabilities_. they should have logical similarities with the jean s instability of self - gravitating systems , or with the modulational instability , leading to the formations of localized structures , as confirmed by preliminary results .",
    "additional dynamical effects , like anomalous diffusion and levy walks , which are reported in the negative specific heat regions , should be linked to these uncommon characteristics of thermodynamics  @xcite .",
    "in particular , diego del castillo negrete  @xcite discusses a mean - field single - wave model that describes the collective dynamics of marginally stable fluids and plasmas .",
    "he shows thus the role of self - consistent chaos in the formation and destruction of coherent structures , and presents a mechanism for violent relaxation of far from equilibrium initial conditions .",
    "the model bears many similarities with toy - models used in the study of systems with long range interactions in statistical mechanics , globally coupled oscillators , and gravitational systems .",
    "one of these toy models is for example studied by dauxois et al  @xcite .",
    "they consider the dynamics of the hamiltonian mean field model which displays several interesting and new features .",
    "they show in particular the emergence of collective properties , i.e. the coherent ( self - consistent ) behavior of the particle motion .",
    "the space - time evolution of such coherent structures can sometimes be understood using the tools of statistical mechanics , otherwise can be a manifestation of the solutions of an associated vlasov equation . both cases in which the interaction among the particles is attractive and the one where it is repulsive are interesting to study : they offer different views to the process of cluster formation and to the development of the collective motion on different time - scales .",
    "the clustering transition can be first or second order , in the usual thermodynamical sense . in the former case ,",
    "ensemble inequivalence naturally arises close to the transition .",
    "the behavior of the lyapunov spectrum is also commented and the universal features of the scaling laws that it involves .",
    "yves elskens  @xcite shows that plasmas are a most common example of systems with long - range interactions , where the interplay between collective ( wave ) and individual ( particle ) degrees of freedom is well known to be central .",
    "this interplay being essentially non - dissipative , its prototype is described by a self - consistent hamiltonian , which provides clear and intuitive pictures of fundamental processes such as the weak warm beam instability and landau damping in their linear regimes .",
    "the description of the nonlinear regimes is more difficult . in the damping case ,",
    "new insight is provided by a statistical mechanics approach , which identified the distinction between a trapping behavior and linear landau behavior in terms of a phase transition . in the unstable case",
    ", the model has shown that the commutation of long - time and large-@xmath0 limits is not guaranteed .",
    "chavanis considers also dynamical aspects in the framework of stellar systems and two - dimensional vortices .",
    "he discusses in particular two possible relaxation scenari : one due to collisions ( or more precisely to discrete interactions ) and the second one , called violent relaxation , really collisionless but due to the mean field effect and the long range of the interaction .",
    "finally , the dynamical processes that give rise to power - law distributions and fractal structures have been studied extensively in recent years .",
    "ofer biham and ofer malcai  @xcite describe recent studies of self - organized criticality in sandpile models as well as studies of multiplicative dynamics , giving rise to power - law distributions .",
    "sandpile models turn out to exhibit universal behavior while in the multiplicative models the powers vary continuously as a function of the parameters .",
    "they consider the formation of a fractal object in the presence of a dynamical mechanism that generates a power - law distribution and presents a model that demonstrates clustering when the probability of adding a particle decays with a power @xmath94 , so it has a short - range nature .",
    "finally , we would like to put a special emphasis on bose einstein condensation ( bec ) , predicted by bose and einstein in 1924 , which could be an important field of applications . with the recent achievement  @xcite of bose - einstein condensation in atomic gases",
    "thanks to the evaporation cooling technique , it becomes possible to study these phenomena in an extremely diluted fluid , thus helping to bridge the gap between theoretical studies , only tractable in dilute systems , and experiments . in the bec , atoms are trapped at such low temperatures that they tumble into the same quantum ground state creating an intriguing laboratory for testing our understanding of basic quantum phenomena .",
    "first , jean dalibard  @xcite presents how coherence and superfluidity are hallmark properties of quantum fluids and encompass a whole class of fundamental phenomena .",
    "he reviews several experimental facts which reveal these two remarkable properties .",
    "coherence appears in interference experiments , carried out either with a single condensate or with several condensates prepared independently .",
    "superfluidity can be revealed by studying the response of the fluid to a rotating perturbation , which involves the nucleation of quantized vortices .",
    "second , ennio arimondo and oliver morsch  @xcite present the current investigations of bose - einstein condensates within optical lattices , where the long range interactions are an essential part of the condensate stability .",
    "previous work with laser cooled atomic gases is also briefly discussed .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "the fluctuations of the number of particles in ideal bose - einstein condensates within the different statistical ensembles has shown interesting differences .",
    "martin holthaus explains  @xcite why the usually taught grand canonical ensemble is inappropriate for determining the fluctuation of the ground - state occupation number of a partially condensed ideal bose gas : it predicts r.m.s .- fluctuations that are proportional to the total particle number at vanishing temperature .",
    "in contrast , both the canonical and the microcanonical ensemble yields fluctuations that vanish properly for the temperature going toward zero .",
    "it turns out that the difference between canonical and microcanonical fluctuations can be understood in close analogy to the familiar difference between the heat capacities at constant pressure and at constant volume .",
    "the detailed analysis of ideal bose - einstein condensates turns out to be very helpful for understanding the occupation number statistics of weakly interacting condensates .",
    "ulf leohnardt  @xcite shows that bose - einstein condensates can serve as laboratory systems for tabletop astrophysics .",
    "in particular , artificial black holes can be made ( sonic or optical black holes ) .",
    "a black hole represents a quantum catastrophe where an initial catastrophic event , for example the collapse of the hole , triggers a continuous emission of quantum radiation ( hawking radiation ) .",
    "the contribution summarizes three classes of quantum catastrophes , two known ones ( black hole , schwinger s pair creation ) and a third new class that can be generated with slow light .",
    "finally , gershon kurizki presents  @xcite an exciting theoretical idea to induce long - range attractions between atoms that acts across the whole bose - einstein condensate .",
    "he shows that dipole - dipole interatomic forces induced by off - resonant lasers @xmath95\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] allow controllable drastic modifications of cold atomic media . `` sacrifying strength for beauty '' , kurizki proposed  @xcite to average out the first term in @xmath96 of the dipole - dipole interaction by the different lasers , in order to keep only the last one with a @xmath1 interaction .",
    "the important point is that induced gravity - like force would be strong enough to see it acting among atoms in the bec :",
    "i.e. that , having induced the gravity - like attraction in the bec , one could switch off the trap used originally to create the bec , and it will remain stable , holding itself together .    depending on the number of lasers , the resulting gravity - like force could be anisotropic for three lasers , or strictly identical to gravity with eighteen lasers  ! if the last proposal is presumably too speculative and if the difficulties ( the power of the laser required being really huge ) facing the experimentalists are a real challenge , the ability to emulate gravitational interactions in the laboratory is of course fascinating .",
    "indeed , these modifications may include the formation of self - gravitating `` bosons stars '' and their plasma - like oscillations , self - bound quasi - onedimensional bose condensates and their `` supersolid '' density modulation , giant cooper pairs and quasibound molecules in optical lattices and anomalous scattering spectra in systems of interacting bosons or fermions .",
    "these novel regimes set the arena for the exploration of exotic astrophysical and condensed -matter objects , by studying their atomic analogs _ in the laboratory_.",
    "the dynamics and thermodynamics of long range system is a rich and fascinating topic in particular for the following issues :    * statistical physics : inequivalence of ensembles , negative specific heat , collisionless relaxation , role of coherent structures , relationship between dynamics and thermodynamics , nonadditivity , generalization of the entropy , ... * this problem has also the nice property to be related to neighbooring scientific disciplines .",
    "not only mathematics with application of catastrophe theory  @xcite , large deviations theory  @xcite , but also to computer science ; because of the long range interactions naive numerical code are of order @xmath97 , and need the developments of efficient algorithms such as the heap based procedure  @xcite , local simulation algorithm for coulomb interaction  @xcite , ... * however , this methodological and fundamental effort should provide a general approach to the problems arising in each specific domain which has motivated this study : astrophysical objects , plasmas , atomic and molecular clusters , fluid dynamics , fracture , bose - einstein condensation , ... in order to detect the depth and the origin of the observed analogies or , on the contrary , to emphasize their specificities .",
    "many of these different aspects are considered in this book but it is clear that , rather than closing the topic , it opens the pandora box .",
