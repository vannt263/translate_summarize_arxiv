    "lattice vibrations are inevitable intrinsic sources of carrier scattering in semiconductors and often dominate transport near room temperature @xcite . in general , scattering by acoustic phonons is the main contribution to the electronic resistivity at low temperatures , and the longitudinal - optical ( lo ) phonons in polar materials limit the room temperature mobility through their coupling with carriers via the long - range frhlich interaction @xcite . since graphene is made of carbons it is a non - polar material and the lack of strong long - range polar optical phonon scattering leads to very high intrinsic ( i.e. , phonon - limited ) room - temperature graphene mobility @xcite and indeed the room - temperature graphene mobility is typically very high in disorder - free suspended graphene samples @xcite .",
    "the weak deformation potential scattering from the thermal lattice acoustic phonons mainly limits the intrinsic mobility of graphene at room temperature and the acoustic phonon scattering gives a quantitatively small contribution even at room temperature due to the high fermi temperature at high carrier density ( and the small deformation potential coupling ) of graphene @xcite .    however , most current available graphene samples for fundamental studies and certainly for technological applications use a polar substrate such as sio@xmath0 , sic , or hfo@xmath0 .",
    "such polar substrates allow for the existence of polar optical phonons localized near the graphene - substrate interface which could be an important scattering source for graphene carriers through the long - range frhlich coupling .",
    "the general eigenvalue equation for a surface phonon mode has been derived at a planar interface between two polar dielectrics @xcite . since the surface optical ( so )",
    "phonon is a well - defined surface property at the interface of the polar semiconductors @xcite it is possible that carriers in graphene layer couple to the so phonon of the underlying substrate lattice via the long - range polar frhlich coupling .",
    "recently , the possible role of surface optical phonon on high temperature graphene mobility has been pointed out @xcite . due to the polar nature of the gate dielectrics used in graphene field effect transistors , the carriers in the conducting channel electrically couple to the long - range surface phonons created at the dielectric interface .",
    "in general , the surface optical phonon contributes little to the carrier resistivity at low temperatures due to its high energy ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "however , the contributions of other scattering processes to the graphene resistivity are small at room temperature and therefore the so phonon may become the dominant scattering mechanism in graphene on a polar dielectric substrate at high temperatures .",
    "it is therefore possible , perhaps even likely , that in the context of graphene technological applications , so phonon effects are particularly important and must be taken into account .",
    "in addition , in a recent experiment @xcite , the strongly coupled plasmon - phonon mode dispersion has been measured by the angle - resolved reflection electron - energy - loss spectroscopy and it is found that the electron - phonon coupling give rise to the many interesting many - body effects in graphene on a polar dielectric substrate @xcite .",
    "this again points to the possible importance of carrier - so phonon coupling in determining the electronic properties of graphene on a substrate .",
    "since the electron - optical phonon interaction leads to many - body renormalization of the single - particle free carrier properties @xcite while at the same affecting the transport properties @xcite a good understanding of electron - so phonon coupling is thus important in developing quantitative theories for many different experimental studies in graphene . in this paper",
    "we calculate the electron self - energy and spectral function of graphene on a polar substrate such as sio@xmath0 , sic , or hfo@xmath0 .",
    "our goal in this paper is to provide a fairly detailed theoretical picture for the electron - so phonon interaction induced polar scattering of free carriers .",
    "many electronic properties of graphene on polar substrates are expected to be modified by electron - so phonon scattering via the flhlich interaction . on a microscopic level",

    "a thorough quantitative understanding of the electron - so phonon interaction induced many - body effects in high mobility graphene is very important with respect to both the device operation and the fundamental physics of graphene on substrates .",
    "this surface polaronic ( i.e. interaction with so phonons ) effect is an important factor in determining the high temperature mobility and the hot electron properties of graphene on substrates .    in this paper",

    "$ ] , we can extract the quasiparticle scattering rate ( scattering lifetime ) , which gives information relevant to possible applications , such as the hot electron relaxation rate and the energy dissipation rate of injected carriers in a graphene - based device .",
    "we calculate the scattering rate as a functions of wave vector , energy , density and temperature and discuss the role of screening effects .",
    "since the electron- surface polar optical phonon interaction has a long range nature the consideration of screening effects is crucial in order to understand quantitative physical properties of graphene .",
    "we find that the scattering rates with screened interaction is reduced by a factor of five , compared with the results with unscreened interaction .",
    "our consideration of screening ( i.e. , the static random phase approximation ( rpa ) screening ) may overestimate the screening effect on scattering rate at low temperatures , but it provides an upper limit of the screening effects .",
    "in addition to calculating the properties of im[@xmath2 due to so phonon interaction , we also calculate the re[@xmath2 , which gives us the corresponding graphene velocity renormalization due to the surface polaronic effect .",
    "we also provide results for the graphene spectral function due to electron - so phonon scattering , which can be directly observed in scatting tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) and angle - resolved photo - electron spectroscopy ( arpes ) .",
    "our theory and results are directly relevant to the electronic properties of doped or gated graphene on polar substrates where so polaron effects may very well be significant .",

    "we provide a rather complete set of numerical results of self - energy , spectral function , and damping rate both for the unscreened interaction and for the static rpa screening interaction .",
    "we find that the scattering rate with screened electron - so phonon interaction is reduced by a factor of five and the self - energy by a factor of ten , compared with the results with unscreened interaction .",
    "the static rpa screening used in this calculation may overestimate the screening effect on scattering rate , but we believe that the static rpa screening provides an upper limit of the screening effects . that is , our unscreened and statically screened results for the surface polar optical phonon scattering rate provide two extreme bounds for the magnitude of the scattering rate since static screening is an overestimation of the actual dynamical screening .",
    "we mention that the static screening approximation becomes very accurate at high carrier density when the typical fermi energy exceeds the so phonon energy , which may already happen at a rather low carrier density of @xmath205@xmath124 .",
    "we therefore believe that our statically screened results should be valid for most graphene samples used experimentally .",
    "in addition to the reduction of the magnitude of the self - energy the screening effects remove the unphysical singular behavior in the self - energy for @xmath20 arising from the long range nature of the electron - so phonon interaction .",
    "we find that the calculated renormalized fermi velocity due to the unscreened electron - so phonon interaction is reduced ( with respect to the bare graphene velocity ) by about 20% , @xmath219 , but for the screened interaction it is reduced by only 2% , @xmath220 at a density @xmath123 @xmath124 .",
    "we note that the renormalized fermi velocity is enhanced about 20% at the same density when the electron - electron coulomb interaction is only considered@xcite . since our consideration of screening in this paper is the rpa static dielectric function we can not state conclusively that the small change of the renormalized velocity in the presence of screened electron - phonon interaction arises from the direct cancellation between these two interactions .",
    "more careful calculation is need to confirm this cancellation by considering the dynamical screening effects treating both the electron - so phonon and the electron - electron coulomb interaction on an equal footing .",
    "but it appears the graphene velocity renormalization due to the electron so phonon interaction by itself is a rather small quantitative effect because of screening effect .",
    "this is certainly true at high carrier densities ( @xmath221 @xmath124 ) where our static screening approximation should apply well .",
    "we also find that the scattering rate for the electron - so phonon interaction depends weakly on the electron energy due to the cancellation between the long range nature of the interaction and the linear behavior of the density of states of graphene . for the in - plane non - polar lo phonon of graphene",
    "the scattering rate strongly depends on the electron energy and high energy electrons are heavily damped by emitting lo phonons .",
    "since the scattering rate due to the so phonon decreases further due to the physical separation between graphene and interface of the dielectric substrate the chance of the hot electron damping by emitting so phonons may be very low in the real graphene samples , but the high - temperature transport in clean graphene may very well be dominated by so phonon scattering from the substrate .",
