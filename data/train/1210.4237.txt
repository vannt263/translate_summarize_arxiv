    "the radio source centaurusa  is hosted by a massive elliptical galaxy ngc5128 , located at a distance of @xmath9mpc ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "as such , it is the closest active galaxy , and its innermost structure , down to hundreds of schwarzschild radii of the central black hole ( mass @xmath10 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , can be studied in great detail with modern high - resolution and high - sensitivity instruments .",
    "yet centaurusa  is at the same time surrounded by a giant radio halo , or rather giant lobes , extending for about @xmath11kpc in the north - south direction and @xmath12 kpc wide .",
    "this fossil structure , although it has been known for a while @xcite , is still relatively poorly studied , because of its huge angular size ( @xmath135deg@xmath149deg ) , which in the past has precluded detailed observational studies .",
    "this situation has changed only very recently , and the giant lobes of the centaurusa  system can now be investigated with the improved angular resolution available at radio and @xmath15-ray frequencies .    since its discovery , the giant halo of centaurusa  ( total radio luminosity @xmath16ergs@xmath17 ) has been observed multiple times with low - resolution single - dish and space - borne radio telescopes .",
    "detailed analysis indicated that the radio spectrum of the southern lobe steepens systematically both with frequency and with distance from the core , in agreement with the expectation for an aging relic ( @xmath18myr - old ) system with the _ volume - averaged _ equipartition magnetic field @xmath19@xmath20 g .",
    "meanwhile , the radio spectrum of the northern lobe was found to be roughly position - independent , inconsistent with the scenario of passive aging , but suggesting instead an ongoing or at least recent injection of radiating electrons throughout the entire volume of the lobe @xcite .",
    "the most recent high - resolution radio observations of the giant structure at 1.4ghz with atca and parkes 64 m telescopes revealed a very inhomogeneous and filamentary structure of the lobes @xcite .",
    "the 50-resolution map derived from this study  `` the most detailed radio continuum image of any radio galaxy to date ''  showed that the northern lobe constitutes an extension of the inner structure ( down to the radio core ) , for which the outer part could be resolved into a series of semi - regularly spaced ( @xmath21kpc ) and concentric shells or filaments with a projected thickness of @xmath22kpc , particularly prominent in the high - resolution radio polarized intensity maps . by contrast , the southern lobe , which appears to be physically unconnected to the core , displayed a largely chaotic and mottled morphology .",
    "the magnetic field structure and thermal matter content of the giant lobes in centaurusa  were also probed recently at radio frequencies by an analysis of the faraday rotation measure ( rm ) using the ensemble of polarized background sources @xcite .",
    "the rm analysis showed that the polarized emission in the northern lobe follows closely the continuum emission down to the sensitivity limits of the survey , with little evidence for depolarization , whereas the emission in the southern lobe is depolarized and chaotic with large jumps in the polarization angle .",
    "the apparent lack of _ internal _ depolarization effects for most of the giant structure enabled a meaningful limit to be placed on the _ volume - averaged _ density of the thermal plasma _ within _ the lobes @xmath23@xmath6 .",
    "this limit is not inconsistent with the analysis of the improved rm data presented in the most recent paper @xcite , resulting in a positive detection of the internal depolarization signal , with the corresponding gas density being @xmath24@xmath6 .",
    "the revealed non - uniform distribution of the rm excess throughout the entire volume of the source should however be kept in mind , as it reflects a highly inhomogeneous distribution of the thermal gas mixed with the lobes , and/or a complex topology of the lobes magnetic field .",
    "centaurusa  is a source of @xmath15-ray emission within the broad energy range from @xmath25kev up to @xmath26tev , as established by the pioneering observations with compton gamma - ray observatory @xcite and h.e.s.s .",
    "cherenkov telescope @xcite .",
    "it was widely believed , however , that it is the active core ( nucleus and nuclear jet ) which dominates the production of @xmath15-rays in the system , especially because this core appears as a very prominent x - ray emitter with a complex , multi - component spectrum ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . and , indeed , even the most recent analysis of the integral / spi data resulted in only upper limits for the soft @xmath15-ray emission of the giant lobes ( @xmath27mev photon flux @xmath28ph@xmath29s@xmath17 ; * ? ? ? * ) . on the other hand ,",
    "during the first 10 months of its operation , the new - generation @xmath15-ray satellite _ fermi_-lat  resolved the giant lobes of centaurusa  @xcite , revealing that they contribute about half of the total flux of the whole system at mev / gev photon energies ( the @xmath30gev lobes luminosity is @xmath31ergs@xmath17 ) .",
    "this important result proved that @xmath15-rays are being efficiently generated within the extended halo , despite the advanced age and relaxed nature of the structure .",
    "the detected emission , well modeled as inverse - compton up - scattering of cosmic background photons by ultrarelativistic electrons , moreover implies that the giant lobes in centaurusa  are close to the condition of energy / pressure equipartition between the radiating particles and the magnetic field ( volume - averaged field strength @xmath32@xmath20g@xmath33 ) .    despite these new data ,",
    "our understanding of the giant lobes in centaurusa  is still incomplete . particularly missing in this context",
    "is x - ray information , even though the large - scale structure of centaurusa  has been the subject of low - resolution , low - sensitivity observations with several previous x - ray satellites .",
    "the first meaningful upper limits for the x - ray emission of the giant lobes in the system were provided by the sas3 instrument @xcite , which probed the @xmath34kev continuum of the target down to a flux level of @xmath35erg@xmath29s@xmath17  ( @xmath36 limit ) .",
    "subsequent observations with _",
    "rosat _ suggested the presence of a giant x - ray structure around the radio halo @xcite , which was , however , not confirmed by later analysis .",
    "finally , asca observations of the outer part of the northern lobe revealed the presence of a compact x - ray feature with the @xmath34kev flux @xmath37erg@xmath29s@xmath17 , which was modeled as a power - law continuum or equivalently by thermal emission from a very hot gas ( @xmath38kev ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , a soft diffuse emission component with a total @xmath39kev flux @xmath40erg@xmath29s@xmath17/0.55deg@xmath41 , distributed within the whole field - of - view of the gis detector , best fitted by a thermal model with @xmath42kev , was tentatively found .",
    "our preliminary analysis of the archival asca data confirmed the presence of the hard x - ray spot , consisting of several intensity peaks aligned roughly with a highly polarized radio filament .",
    "however , some of the x - ray emission peaks coincide with the positions of optical background radio sources , and as such may be unrelated to the giant lobes . a more detailed discussion on the archival asca data , together with the analysis of the forthcoming follow - up _ suzaku _  and _ chandra _ observations will be published in a later paper .    to close the gap between the x - ray studies of the giant halo in centaurusa  and the most recent observations at other wavelengths , in previous years we have requested the very first",
    "observations of the southern lobe ( ao-5 , @xmath4351401 ) .",
    "the low and relatively constant instrumental background of _ suzaku _  is ideally suited for observations of low - surface brightness diffuse sources such as giant lobes of centaurusa .",
    "in addition , the spatial resolution of the _ suzaku _ s xis ( @xmath44 ) is well matched to the recently obtained high - resolution ( 50 ) radio maps of the giant lobes , while the fov of the instrument ( @xmath45deg@xmath46deg ) is large enough to encapsulate within a single _ suzaku _  pointing the large - scale structures ( shells / filaments ) revealed by the radio polarization maps ; _ suzaku _  is therefore an ideal instrument for this work .",
    "however , because of the large extension of the giant lobes on the sky , only a small part of their structure could be covered in the two 80-ks exposures that were performed . in this paper",
    "we report on the analysis of these _ suzaku _  data , focusing firstly on distinct x - ray features detected within the field - of - view ( fov ) of the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ) centered on the radio - bright part of the southern lobe , and secondly on the diffuse emission filling the whole fov of the instrument and apparently related to the centaurusa  halo .",
    "our results are presented in detail in  [ sec : data ] and discussed further in ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] below .",
    "two regions within the southern lobe of centaurusa  were observed with the _ suzaku _  satellite @xcite from 2010 august 10 to 2010 august 12 , as indicated in figure[fig : x - rint ] showing the 1.4ghz total intensity map of the whole giant centaurusa  structure @xcite with the two _ suzaku _  pointings marked as blue squares .",
    "the observation log , with details such as the nominal pointing positions and observation times , is summarized in the first two rows of table[tab : obslog ] ( `` lobe1 '' and `` lobe2 '' exposures ) . in this paper , we restrict the analysis to the data taken with the xis instrument @xcite , which consists of four ccd sensors each placed on the focal plane of the x - ray telescope ( xrt ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and focus first (  [ sec : spots][sec : spotmodel ] ) on faint x - ray features likely associated , as argued below , with fine structure of the lobe revealed by the most recent high - quality radio maps @xcite .",
    "next (  [ sec : diffuse ] ) we present the analysis of the diffuse emission component filling the whole fov of the instrument ; for this analysis we estimate the background from two shorter `` off '' _ suzaku _  exposures , targeting the blank sky outside of ( but close to ) the centaurusa  southern lobe , as summarized in the last two rows of table[tab : obslog ] ( `` lobe3 '' and `` lobe4 '' ; see also figure[fig : rosat ] below ) . at the time of the performed observations the two front - illuminated ccds ( xis0 and xis3 ) and one back - illuminated ccd ( xis1 ) were working well , so the data discussed below for all the pointings were performed with all the xis sensors set to full - window and normal clocking modes .    in the following",
    "we describe the screening criteria for xis data .",
    "events with ` grade ` 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 6 were utilized in the data reduction procedure , and flickering pixels were removed by using ` cleansis ` .",

    "we note that x - ray counterparts for hd116386 and hd116099 are listed in the _ rosat _ all - sky survey ( rass ) catalog as 1rxsj132403.1@xmath52451358 and 1rxsj132204.7@xmath52450312 , respectively ; these , in fact , are the only cataloged x - ray sources within the area covered by the two analyzed _ suzaku _  pointings .",
    "the other x - ray features detected with _ suzaku _  at high significance level are missing any obvious galactic or extragalactic identifications ( ned or simbad databases ) , and as such are considered below as ` possibly related to the lobe ' ; these are marked in figure[fig : suzaku ] with white circles and denoted as `` src18 '' .",
    "it should be noted that spurious x - ray features due to instrumental artifacts are present in the left - hand bottom corners of the two fovs , and these are caused by the degradation of the ccd sensor xis0 by the anomalous charge leakage .        for the spectral analysis of the eight x - ray features classified as ` possibly related to the lobe ' we extracted the source fluxes from circular regions with radii 1.5  ( well - matched to the psf of the xis instrument ) centered on each spot ( see figure[fig : suzaku ] ) , and the background fluxes from larger ellipsoidal regions `` bgd / lobe1 '' and `` bgd / lobe2 '' chosen in the corresponding fovs to avoid any compact feature .",
    "the photon statistics for the analyzed regions are given in table[tab : stat ] .",
    "only src3 and 58 are detected at a significance level above @xmath56 .    with the given photon statistics it is impossible to state if the ` possibly related ' spots are point - like for the xis detector , or if they are ( marginally ) extended .",
    "it is also not possible at this point to state with high certainty if the detected x - ray features with no obvious counterparts at optical wavelengths are indeed physically associated with the giant centaurusa  structure .",
    "a comparison of the radio and x - ray morphologies presented in ",
    "[ sec : spotmodel ] below indicates that this may indeed be the case , at least for some of them ( see also the discussion in ",
    "[ sec : spot - origin ] ) . and",
    "similarly , one can not exclude the possibility of a chance coincidence between an x - ray spot associated with the giant lobe and a background / foreground optical object .",
    "because the exact positions of the detected x - ray features can not be measured given the angular resolution of the xis instrument and the photon statistics that we obtain , no meaningful quantification of a chance probability for spurious association with background / foreground object can be made .",
    "here we consider an association with such an object unlikely if all cataloged sources are located more than 1.5  away from the centers of the circular regions used for the source flux extraction ( see table[tab : stat ] ) .",
    "for the selected features 18 analyzed further below , this criterion is marginally violated only in the case of src1 , with the galaxy 2masxj13234402@xmath524505410 falling formally within the selected _ suzaku _  source region . the analysis presented in the section  [ sec : spotmodel ] confirms , however , that the three prominent x - ray spots coinciding with bright optical stars , and as such classified as unrelated to the lobe , are spectrally distinct when compared with the other detected features .",
    "these other features are therefore not likely to be foreground stars , and instead we have to consider the possibility that they are associated with uncataloged background agn .    in order to evaluate the expected number of background agn within the fovs of the two _ suzaku _  `` on '' pointings , we note that the @xmath57 distribution of such objects , constructed by @xcite based on the _ chandra _ deep field - south observations and _ rosat _ observations of the lockman hole , gives the number of sources with @xmath39kev fluxes @xmath58erg@xmath29s@xmath17  between 20/deg@xmath41 and 3/deg@xmath41 ( including the @xmath59 uncertainties due to the sum of the poisson noise ) .",
    "this implies a _",
    "maximum _ of four background agn within the two _ effective _ fovs of the xis instrument ( @xmath60/deg@xmath41 ) at the accessible flux level , a factor of at least two below the detected number of the x - ray spots _ with no cataloged optical counterparts_. the number of background x - ray sources evaluated by @xcite in the hard band , i.e. sources with @xmath34kev fluxes @xmath58erg@xmath29s@xmath17 , is on the other hand higher , namely @xmath61/deg@xmath41 ( as confirmed by other , more recent estimates , in agreement with the results of agn population synthesis models ; e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , meaning that we would expect about seven agn within the area of the giant lobe covered by the _ suzaku _  observations .",
    "this number is close to the number of our detected x - ray spots with no obvious optical identification . yet",
    "unidentified background agn are typically characterized by very flat spectra around kev photon energies ( the average photon index @xmath62 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while src18 discussed here display on average much steeper x - ray continua ( as we will show in  [ sec : spotmodel ] below ) .",
    "these spots therefore do not have the appearance of regular type 2 agn lacking optical identification due to a substantial intrinsic obscuration , with the possible exception of src3 .",
    "moreover , we note that the two shorter `` off '' pointings with _",
    "reveal no bright x - ray features at the flux level of src18 discussed here ( which all lie well above the nominal limiting flux for the 20ks exposure time of the ` off ' pointings ) , except for objects with cataloged galactic or extragalactic counterparts .",
    "hence , we conclude that while the contamination of the analyzed _ suzaku _  pointings with unidentified background agn is an issue , there seems to be a slight overabundance of relatively bright and steep - spectrum x - ray sources in the `` on '' pointings when compared both with the `` off '' pointings and also with the expected @xmath63 distribution of background agn .",

    "we speculate that the magnetic energy released locally at the sites of reconnecting magnetic tubes / radio filaments loads turbulence into the system , and that this turbulence is in turn responsible for the confinement and acceleration of relativistic particles within distinct emission sites . alternatively ,",
    "if most of the released magnetic energy goes into heating of the plasma rather than acceleration of ultrarelativistic particles , the thermal scenario , involving short - lived and highly over - pressured gaseous clumps remains a valid possibility , suggesting an efficient transfer of the magnetic energy to the internal energy of the lobes thermal plasma during the lifetime of the source .",
    "large - scale highly polarized radio filaments have been detected within the lobes of several other famous radio galaxies @xcite . apparently similar structures are observed in the galactic center region @xcite . the origin and the exact structure of such features is unclear , but tangled magnetic field tubes are often invoked in this context ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the x - ray observations reported here constitute an interesting insight into the problem , suggesting in particular that , as in fact expected in the case of tangled field tubes by analogy with solar phenomena , localized regions of enhanced turbulence enable efficient cosmic ray acceleration and/or plasma heating form a set of transient ` hot spots ' in compact sites where separate filaments interact with each other or with over - densities in the ambient plasma so that magnetic reconnection takes place .",
    "while we have emphasized the possibility of reconnection acting as a source of the turbulence , there are other processes that could account for such a localized enhancement .",
    "if the centaurusa  giant halo is indeed a source of very - high to ultra - high energy cosmic rays , as has been discussed in the literature @xcite prompted by the results of the p. auger observatory ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the flux of these particles through such regions can in principle produce un - compensated currents , amplifying small - scale magnetic fields and turbulent motions , in a process analogous to that frequently considered in the context of supernova remnants @xcite .",
    "we have also presented a detailed analysis of the diffuse emission component filling the whole fov of the xis instrument , which remains after removing all the compact x - ray features .",
    "we found that at the position of the centaurusa  giant lobes probed with _",
    "suzaku _  a relatively prominent soft x - ray excess , best described as thermal emission from hot gas with the temperature of @xmath197kev , seems to be present .",
    "this excess , if related to the centaurusa  system rather than some large - scale fluctuation in the foreground galactic halo emission , may be either due to thermal matter mixed with the non - thermal plasma of the giant lobes , or due to a condensation of the hot intergalactic medium around the edges of the expanding radio structure .",
    "the former possibility would interestingly imply a number density of the x - ray emitting gas of roughly @xmath322@xmath6 , as well as almost exact pressure balance between the lobes thermal and non - thermal contents ( again in analogy with the interstellar medium within the galactic disk ) .",
    "these conclusions , which are still tentative and somewhat preliminary , are in agreement with the most recent analysis of the radio data presented by @xcite .",
    "it is important to emphasize that our finding regarding the plasma @xmath7 parameter being of the order of unity in the giant lobes of centaurusa  may be crucial for understanding the dynamics and evolution of the reconnecting magnetic field in the system .",
    "@xcite argued for example that the evolution of the expanding lobes containing _ some _ thermal plasma and _ some _ magnetic flux will always be accompanied by a decrease in the @xmath7 parameter , leading at some point to the spontaneous formation of electric current sheets and large - scale reconnection layers which are likely involved in acceleration of the highest energy cosmic rays .",
    "regardless of the exact processes involved in the formation of the observed x - ray sub - structure of the lobes , however , or of the origin of the soft diffuse excess emission , the total x - ray emission of the whole giant halo in centaurusa  appears to be a complex mixture of diffuse and compact thermal and non - thermal components . only with the broad energy coverage and the suitable combination of the sensitivity and resolution of _ suzaku _",
    "has it been possible to disentangle these components ; otherwise they would form a single emission continuum .",
    "if our preliminary conclusion that these various emission components are indeed related to the centaurusa  system is correct , there are important implications for understanding the physics of radio - loud agn : the structure of the extended lobes in such systems may be highly inhomogeneous and non - uniform , with magnetic reconnection and turbulent acceleration processes continuously converting magnetic energy to the internal energy of the plasma particles , leading to possibly significant spatial and temporal variations in the plasma @xmath7 parameter and pressure equilibrium conditions . forthcoming _ suzaku _",
    "pointings and the follow - up _ chandra _ observations of the centaurusa  giant lobes will shortly allow us to test the above conclusions .",
    "finally , we note that a possibly significant contribution from compact features and thermal plasma to the total observed x - ray flux of the extended lobes means that without detailed good - quality x - ray maps enabling the various emission components to be disentangled , the ratio of total x - ray and radio fluxes , typically used to infer _ volume - averaged _ magnetic field intensity ( under the working assumption that the inverse - compton scattering of cmb photons by radio - emitting electrons uniformly filling the lobe provides the dominant contribution to the measured x - ray flux ) , should be used with some caution ( see the related discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , departures from the energy equipartition often claimed because of apparently high values of this ratio ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , may be partly invalidated , and the lobes instead , of being dominated by the relativistic particle pressure , may well be _ on average _ very close to energy equipartition , @xmath323 , as proposed in this paper for the centaurusa  giant lobes .",
