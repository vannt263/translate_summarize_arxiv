    "heat conductivity in one - dimensional ( 1d ) lattices is a well known classical problem related to the microscopic foundation of fourier s law .",
    "the problem started from the famous work of fermi , pasta , and ulam ( fpu ) @xcite , where an abnormal process of heat transfer was detected for the first time .",
    "non - integrability of a system is a necessary condition for normal heat conductivity . as it was demonstrated recently for the fpu lattice @xcite , disordered harmonic chain @xcite , diatomic 1d gas of colliding particles @xcite , and the diatomic toda lattice @xcite , non - integrability is not sufficient in order to get normal heat conductivity .",
    "it leads to linear distribution of temperature along the chain for small gradient , but the value of heat flux is proportional to @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the number of particles of the chain , and number exponent @xmath2 .",
    "thus , the coefficient of heat conductivity diverges in the thermodynamic limit @xmath3 .",
    "analytical estimations @xcite have demonstrated that any chain possessing an acoustic phonon branch should have infinite heat conductivity in the limit of low temperatures .    from the other side , there are some artificial systems with on - site potential ( ding - a - ling and related models ) which have normal heat conductivity @xcite",
    ". the heat conductivity of the frenkel - kontorova chain was first considered in ref .",
    "@xcite . finite heat conductivity for certain parameters was observed for frenkel - kontorova chain @xcite , for the chain with sinh - gordon on - site potential @xcite , and for the chain with @xmath4 on - site potential @xcite .",
    "these models are not invariant with respect to translation and the momentum is not conserved .",
    "it was supposed that the on - site potential is extremely significant for normal heat conduction @xcite and that the anharmonicity of the on - site potential is sufficient to ensure the validity of fourier s law @xcite .",
    "a recent detailed review of the problem is presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "probably the most interesting question related to heat conductivity of 1d models ( which actually inspired the first investigation of fermi , pasta and ulam [ 1 ] ) is whether small perturbation of an integrable model will lead to convergent heat conduction coefficient .",
    "one supposes that for the one - dimensional chains with conserved momentum the answer is negative @xcite .",
    "still , normal heat conduction has been observed in some special systems with conserved momentum @xcite , but it may be clearly demonstrated only well apart from integrable limit .",
    "the situation is not so clear in the systems with on - site potential .",
    "although it was supposed that non - integrable system without additional integrals of motion would have convergent heat conductivity @xcite , no rigorous proof was presented . from the other side , recent attempt of numerical simulation of heat transfer in frenkel - kontorova model @xcite demonstrated that because of computational difficulties no unambiguous conclusion can be drawn whether heat conduction is convergent for all finite values of perturbation of the integrable limit system ( linear chain or continuous sine - gordon system ) .",
    "it seems that computational difficulties of investigation of heat conduction in a vicinity of integrable limit are not just issue of weak computers or ineffective procedures . in the systems with conserved momentum divergent heat conduction",
    "is fixed by power - like decrease of heat flux autocorrelation function with power less than unity .",
    "still , for the systems with on - site potential exponential decrease is more typical @xcite . for any fixed value of the exponent",
    "the heat conduction converges ; if the exponent tends to zero with the value of the perturbation of the integrable case , then for any finite value of the perturbation the characteristic correlation time and length will be finite but may become very large .",
    "consequently , they will exceed any available computation time or size of the system and still no conclusion on the convergence of heat conduction will be possible .    in this respect it is reasonable to mention the findings of our papers @xcite concerning the transitions from infinite to finite heat conduction in the chain of rotators and frenkel - kontorova system .",
    "these findings were criticized in paper @xcite by providing the computation results for larger systems .",
    "we agree with the authors that the results of papers @xcite do not prove the reality of the above transition .",
    "in fact , we have pointed it out in @xcite . from the other side ,",
    "it is clear that such more extended numerical simulations can not prove that the transitions do not exist at all .",
    "probably , such conclusion may be driven if , with the help of some not yet developed method , the simulation length or effective time will be extended by many orders of magnitude .    the other way to overcome",
    "this difficulty is to construct a model , which will be , at least to some extent , tractable analytically and will allow one to predict some characteristic features of the heat transfer process and the behavior of the heat conduction coefficient . afterwards",
    "the numerical simulation may be used to verify the assumptions made in the analytic treatment . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", no models besides pure harmonic chains were treated in such a way to date .",
    "introduction and investigation of a nontrivial model of this sort is a scope of present paper .",
    "we are going to demonstrate that there exist models which have integrable system as their natural limit case , small perturbation of the integrability immediately leading to convergent heat conduction .",
    "the mechanism of energy scattering in this kind of systems is universal for any temperature and set of the model parameters .",
    "the simplest example of such model is one - dimensional set of equal rigid particles with nonzero diameter @xmath5 subjected to periodic on - site potential .",
    "this system is completely integrable only if @xmath6 .",
    "it will be demonstrated that any @xmath7 leads to effective mixing due to unequal exchange of energy between the particles in each collision .",
    "this mixing leads to diffusive mechanism of the heat transport and , subsequently , to convergent heat conduction .",
    "let us consider the one - dimensional system of hard particles with equal masses subject to periodic on - site potential .",
    "the hamiltonian of this system will read @xmath8 where @xmath9  mass of the particle , @xmath10  coordinate of the center of the @xmath11-th particle , @xmath12  velocity of this particle , @xmath13  periodic on - site potential with period @xmath14 @xmath15 $ ] .",
    "interaction of absolutely hard particles is described by the following potential @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the diameter of the particle .",
    "this potential corresponds to pure elastic impact with unit recovery coefficient .",
    "sketch of the model considered is presented at fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "sketch of the hard - disk chain exposed to periodic on - site potential @xmath13 ( @xmath14 is the period of the potential , @xmath18  its height , @xmath17 is the diameter of the disks ) .",
    "piecewise - linear potential ( [ f10 ] ) ( a ) and sinusoidal potential ( [ f20 ] ) ( b ) are plotted .",
    ", scaledwidth=75.0% ]    it is well - known that the elastic collision of two equal particles with collinear velocity vectors leads to exchange of their velocities .",
    "an external potential present does not change this fact , since the collision takes zero time and thus the effect of the external force on the energy and momentum conservation is absent .",
    "the one - dimensional chain of equivalent hard particles without external potential is a paradigm of the integrable nonlinear chain , since all interactions are reduced to exchange of velocities . in other words , the individual values of velocities",
    "are preserved and just transferred from particle to particle .",
    "it is natural therefore to introduce quasiparticles associated with these individual values of velocities .",
    "they will be characterized by a pair of parameters @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is an energy of the quasiparticle , @xmath21 is a unit vector in a direction of its motion . every particle in every moment `` carries '' one quasiparticle .",
    "the elastic collision between the particles leads to simple exchange of parameters of the associated quasiparticles , therefore the quasiparticles themselves should be considered as non - interacting .",
    "the situation changes if the external on - site potential is present .",
    "it is easy to introduce similar quasiparticles ( @xmath22 will be a sum of kinetic and potential energy ) .",
    "the unit vector * n * of each quasiparticle between subsequent interactions may be either constant ( motion in one direction ) or periodically changing ( vibration of the particle in a potential well ) . in every collision the particles exchange their velocity vectors , but do not change their positions .",
    "consequently two quasiparticles interact in a way described by the following relationships : @xmath23 the values denoted by apostrophe correspond to the state after the collision , @xmath24 is a point of contact between the particles .",
    "it should be mentioned that in the case of nonzero diameter the quasiparticles are associated with the centers of the carrying particles .    if the diameter of the particles is zero , then the additives to the energies in the first two equations of system ( [ f3 ] )",
    "compensate each other and the energies of the quasiparticles are preserved in the collision",
    ". therefore effectively the interaction between the quasiparticles disappears and the chain of equal particles with zero size subject to any on - site potential turns out to be completely integrable system .",
    "thus , contrary to some previous statements it is possible to construct an example of strongly nonlinear one - dimensional chain without momentum conservation , which will have clearly divergent heat conductivity ( even linear temperature profile will not be formed ) .",
    "the situation differs if the size of the particles is not zero , as the individual energies of the quasiparticles are not preserved in the collisions . in order to consider the effect of such interaction we propose simplified semi - phenomenological analytical model .",
    "after @xmath25 collisions the energy of the quasiparticle will be @xmath26 where @xmath27-th collision takes place in point @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the initial energy of the quasiparticle .",
    "now we suppose that the coordinates of subsequent contact points @xmath30 , taken by modulus of the period of the on - site potential , are not correlated .",
    "such proposition is equivalent to fast phase mixing in a system close to integrable one and is well - known in various kinetic problems @xcite .",
    "the consequences of this proposition will be verified below by direct numerical simulation .",
    "average energy of the quasiparticle is equal to @xmath31 over the ensemble of the quasiparticles , as obviously @xmath32 .",
    "still , the second momentum will be nonzero : @xmath33 the right - hand side of this expression will depend only on the exact shape of the potential function @xmath34 ^ 2dx ,         \\label{f6}\\ ] ] the last expression is correct only at the limit of high temperatures ; it neglects the fact that the quasiparticle spends more time near the top of the potential barrier due to lower velocity .",
    "let us consider the quasiparticle with initial energy @xmath35 , where @xmath18 is the height of the potential barrier .",
    "therefore vector @xmath36 is constant .",
    "equations ( [ f5 ] ) and ( [ f6 ] ) describe random walks of the energy of the quasiparticle along the energy scale axis .",
    "therefore after certain number of steps ( collisions ) the energy of the quasiparticle will enter the zone below the potential barrier @xmath37 . in this case",
    "the behaviour of the quasiparticle will change , as constant vector @xmath36 will become oscillating , as described above .",
    "after some additional collisions the energy will again exceed @xmath18 , but the direction of motion of the quasiparticle will be arbitrary .",
    "it means that the only mechanism of energy transfer in the system under consideration is associated with diffusion of the quasiparticles , which are trapped by the on - site potential and afterwards released in arbitrary direction .",
    "such traps - and - releases resemble umklapp processes of phonon - phonon interaction @xcite , but occur in a purely classic system .",
    "the diffusion of the quasiparticles in the chain is characterized by mean free path , which may be evaluated as @xmath38}{n_cf(d ) } ,         \\label{f7}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is a number of particles over one period of the on - site potential ( concentration ) .",
    "coefficient 2 appears due to equivalent probability of positive and negative energy shift in any collision , @xmath40  temperature of the system , @xmath41  boltzmann constant .",
    "average absolute velocity of the quasiparticle may be estimated as @xmath42 here the first multiplier takes into account the nonzero value of @xmath17 and absolute rigidity of the particles .",
    "the second one is due to standard maxwell distribution function for 1d case .",
    "heat capacity of the system over one particle is unity , as the number of degrees of freedom ( i.e. the number of quasiparticles ) coincides with the number of the particles and does not depend on the temperature and other parameters of the system .",
    "therefore the coefficient of heat conductivity may be estimated @xcite as @xmath43 it is already possible to conclude that according to ( [ f9 ] ) regardless the concrete shape of potential @xmath13 in the limit @xmath44 we have @xmath45 and therefore @xmath46 , although for every nonzero value @xmath17 the heat conductivity will be finite . therefore unlikely known models with conserved momentum the small perturbation of the integrable case @xmath6 immediately brings about convergent heat conductivity .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the dimensionless variables for the following numerical simulation .",
    "let us set the mass of each particle @xmath47 , on - site potential period @xmath48 , its height @xmath49 , and boltzmann constant @xmath50 in all above relationships .",
    "we suppose that the chain contains one particle per each period of the potential , i.e. that @xmath51 , and the particle diameter @xmath52 .",

    "then it follows from ( [ f9 ] ) that the non - dimensional heat conduction coefficient is expressed as @xmath54 where function @xmath55    the numerical scheme for solving the equations of motion describing the dynamics of the 1d hard - point gas has been developed in a series of papers @xcite .",

    "each particle moves under constant force with sign dependent on the position of the particle .",

    "this coincidence is very profound if speaking about the asymptotic scaling behavior of the heat conduction coefficient in the cases of small and large particle sizes , as well as for the case of high temperatures .",
    "the characteristic behavior of the heat conduction coefficient does not depend on the exact shape of the on - site potential function .",

    "the limit case of zero - size particles is integrable , but the slightest perturbation of this integrable case by introducing the nonzero size leads to drastic change of the behavior  it becomes diffusive and the heat conduction coefficient converges .",
    "it should be stressed that this class of universality , unlikely the systems with conserved momentum , can not be revealed by sole numerical simulation .",
    "the reason is that the correlation length ( as well as the heat conduction coefficient ) diverges as the system approaches the integrable limit ; therefore any finite capacity of the numerical installation will be exceeded .",

    "<S> heat conduction of one - dimensional chain of equivalent rigid particles in the field of external on - site potential is considered . </S>",
    "<S> zero diameters of the particles correspond to exactly integrable case with divergent heat conduction coefficient . by means of simple analytical model </S>",
    "<S> it is demonstrated that for any nonzero particle size the integrability is violated and the heat conduction coefficient converges . </S>",
    "<S> the result of the analytical computation is verified by means of numerical simulation in a plausible diapason of parameters and good agreement is observed </S>"
