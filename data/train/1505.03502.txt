    "the presence of geometric frustration disfavors long - range antiferromagnetic order and promotes a complex magnetic state in insulating magnets with short - range interaction @xcite .",
    "two complications arise in magnetic insulators close to a mott insulator - metal transition ( imt ) : ( i )  the ` virtual hopping ' of the electrons mediate long - range and multispin coupling , and ( ii )  the _ magnitude _ of the local moments weaken as the system is pushed towards the imt . the first effect can lift the degeneracy of the short range model and promote an ordered state while the second tends to destroy the magnetic state altogether .",
    "the outcome of this interplay is lattice specific @xcite , of relevance to several real life materials , and requires tools beyond those usually applied in frustrated magnetism .",
    "the possibilities in charge transport are also interesting .",
    "while the large moment , gapped , mott phase is insulating , the strong suppression of the moment near the imt , and possible orientational randomness due to frustration , can generate a ` bad metal ' state on the disordered magnetic background .",
    "such a state can involve a pseudogap , an unusually large low temperature resistivity @xcite , and , possibly , an anomalous hall response if the moments organize in a non coplanar manner @xcite .",
    "the pyrochlores are a fascinating structure @xcite to explore these effects . in the deep mott state on a pyrochlore lattice , where one expects only nearest neighbor antiferromagnetic coupling",
    ", the effective model can be written as a sum , over the tetrahedra , of squares of the total moment in each tetrahedron @xcite .",
    "the minimum of this is infinitely degenerate since the four spins at the vertices of each tetrahedron just need to satisfy a zero vector sum .",
    "the appearance of longer range couplings as the electron - electron hubbard repulsion reduces ( or the bandwidth increases ) can , potentially , lift the degeneracy and promote some ordered state .",
    "the transport and spectral character between the spin liquid mott insulator and the band semimetal is also not known .",
    "there are , remarkably , experimental realisations of mott physics on the pyrochlore structure as observed in the rare - earth molybdates @xcite and iridates @xcite .",
    "these , however , involve 4d or 5d electrons and require hund s coupling or spin - orbit interaction , in addition to the hubbard interaction , for a successful description . to set the stage for these more realistic but complex models",
    "this paper focuses on the role of just the hubbard interaction on the half filled pyrochlore lattice .",
    "we address two broad questions : ( i )  what is the nature of the magnetic state as one moves towards weaker interaction in the mott insulator , and in particular what are the magnetic correlations near the imt ? ( ii )  what is the impact of these magnetic correlations on electron physics ( resistivity , optics , spectral features ) near the imt ?",
    "our main results , obtained by using a real - space static auxiliary - field - based method , are the following : ( i )  increasing interaction in the ground state leads successively to a small - moment metal , then a narrow insulating pseudogap window , and finally to the gapped mott insulator .",
    "( ii )  the resistivity and the low energy density of states have a _ strongly non monotonic _ temperature dependence near the metal - insulator transition ( mit ) .",
    "( iii )  the finite moment phases , from near the mit to the deep mott regime , _ are all disordered_. well in the mott phase they display what seems ( within the limits of our system size ) to be power law spatial correlations that survive to a small finite temperature .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we provide a summary of existing results on the pyrochlore structure - in particular the heisenberg and hubbard models .",
    "this is followed by a description of our method .",
    "the next section presents results on the phase diagram , density of states , transport , and optics , across the mit .",
    "the final section expands on a few issues like effective models for the magnetism , computational issues , and the magnetic structure factor .",
    "the pyrochlore heisenberg antiferromagnet model , which describes the deep mott limit , has been well studied , the hubbard model much less so .",
    "we summarize the key results from these and then move to our method and results .",
    "while the hubbard model at half - filling and large interaction maps on to the @xmath0 heisenberg antiferromagnet , we provide a more general discussion of this model below .    the nearest - neighbor _ classical _ heisenberg antiferromagnet , @xmath1 , on the pyrochlore lattice does not show any magnetic order down to zero temperature @xcite ( @xmath2 ) .",

    "our computational cost and size limitations we only get a hint of this spin liquid state . by the time @xmath169 , which is @xmath170 at @xmath162 , the @xmath11 dependence is completely featureless .",
    "there are several approximations , analytic and numerical , we had to make to achieve some headway .",
    "let us comment on these one by one , and their effect on the reliability of our results",
    ".      in principle both spatial and temporal fluctuations could be important near the mott transition on the pyrochlore lattice .",
    "however , fully handling the temporal fluctuations of the @xmath27 and @xmath28 fields requires a quantum monte carlo scheme .",
    "the absence of such results is probably due to the sign problem for fermions in the frustrated geometry .",
    "we have retained only the zero matsubara frequency , @xmath171 , mode of the auxiliary fields , exactly .",
    "it is possible , but non trivial , to set up a gaussian expansion for the finite @xmath172 modes of @xmath27 and @xmath28 , while retaining and treating the @xmath173 mode exactly as we have .",
    "this is a project for the future . in the absence of such a calculation",
    "we can only make the following conjectures .",
    "( i )  local moments would remain well defined in the insulating phase , due to the gap .",
    "since the present theory itself predicts no order at any @xmath14 or temperature , we do not expect additional quantum fluctuations to qualitatively modify the magnetic state .",
    "( ii )  a possible _ qualitative consequence _ of quantum fluctuations could be the restoration of translation invariance in the ` magnetic metal ' phase .",
    "we can not make a definite comment on this but even if this were to happen , making the metallic state perfectly conducting at @xmath2 , we believe that above a low coherence temperature one would see the signature of a highly resistive metal .      we have done our calculations on lattices that involve @xmath174 atoms .",
    "this is much larger than what is typically accessible in full - fledged fermion quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) ( since temporal fluctuations also have to be included ) , allowing us to access resistivity and spectral features which do not involve artificial broadening .",
    "it is possible to try the calculations on @xmath175 lattices ( involving about @xmath176 atoms ) and checks at individual parameters do not reveal a significant difference .",
    "colour online : comparison of the variationally obtained average moment value with result from the monte carlo as @xmath70 .",
    ", width=226,height=173 ]      our metropolis update involves a small cluster rather than diagonalisation of the full hamiltonian .",
    "this is well controlled in the large @xmath14 limit when the ` range ' of electron excursion is limited but less reliable near the mott transition . for that purpose",
    "we have used a variational calculation , described below , that uses the mc result as an ansatz and checks the stability of such a state on large ( up to @xmath177 lattices ) for the ground state .",
    "the results are discussed below - and are qualitatively consistent with the cluster based mc .",
    "since mc hints that the magnetic ground state involves disordered local moments for @xmath178 , we tried a simple variational check .",
    "we set up trial configurations @xmath179 with random orientation , but uniform magnitude @xmath180 , with @xmath180 as a variational parameter .",
    "this differs from the real situation where the @xmath27 s have some amplitude inhomogeneity and also orientational correlation .",
    "energy minimisation confirms the presence of a small moment phase , beyond some @xmath181 , with an initial slow growth of @xmath182 and then a rapid crossover to large values at some @xmath183 ( see figure [ vc ] ) .",
    "the @xmath181 and @xmath183 are about @xmath184 higher than mc estimates and may get reduced if spatial correlations are included .",
    "pyrochlore mott materials include the rare - earth based molybdates r@xmath12mo@xmath12o@xmath13 and iridates r@xmath12ir@xmath12o@xmath13 ( r is a rare - earth ion or y ) . the mo and ir ions live on a pyrochlore lattice while the r inhabit an interpenetrating pyrochlore structure .",
    "in contrast to 3d electron based systems which are dominated by the hubbard @xmath14 , the molybdates involve 4d electrons - where the hund s coupling @xmath185 is also important , while the iridates involve 5d electrons - with spin - orbit coupling playing a vital role . in this paper we focused on the simple hubbard model as the starting problem . in what follows",
    "we quickly list out the key molybdate and iridate mott features ( see table [ tab ] ) and argue how some of these are already visible in our present results .",
    "the molybdates exhibit a mit with decreasing rare - earth ionic radius @xmath186 * ? ? ? * .",
    "materials with larger @xmath186 are ferromagnetic ( fm ) metals , those with small @xmath186 are spin glass ( sg ) insulators @xcite , and there is a sg metal phase @xcite near the mit .",
    "pressure and magnetic field can drive an imt in materials like gd@xmath12mo@xmath12o@xmath13 which are weakly insulating @xcite .",
    "an anomalous hall effect ( ahe ) has been observed @xcite in nd@xmath12mo@xmath12o@xmath13 and is ascribed to non vanishing spin chirality .",
    "the iridates also show a mit with decreasing @xmath186 , but in this case the mi transition is accompanied by a magnetic transition from a paramagnetic to an antiferromagnetic ` all - in - all - out ' ( aiao ) ordering @xcite . while the magnetic character differs distinctly from molybdates ,",
    "iridates also show a pressure driven insulator - metal transitions , via unusually resistive ground states @xcite , and spin chirality driven ahe @xcite in materials like pr@xmath12ir@xmath12o@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "reducing @xmath186 reduces the hopping in these materials and is akin to increasing the @xmath17 ratio in our model .",
    "the general observation @xcite of a metal - insulator transition with reducing @xmath186 is consistent with our phase diagram . in the table above , however we compare a set of indicators between molybdate or iridate experiments and our present theory . while the presence of electron correlation on a pyrochlore structure is common to all three , there are additional interactions present in the real materials .",
    "the one common feature that emerges is the occurence of a high resistivity ground state close to the mit which , we believe , is due to the coupling of electrons to disordered spin and orbital moments .",
    "this is a general consequence of the interplay of correlation effects and strong geometric frustration .",
    "we will discuss the detailed iridate and molybdate theories elsewhere .",
    "we have studied the mott transition in half - filled hubbard model on a pyrochlore lattice . the geometric frustration and",
    "the corresponding large magnetic degeneracy prevents the occurence of any magnetic order in the deep mott state .",
    "this continues all the way to the insulator - metal transition . beyond the insulator - metal transition",
    "there is a window with a pseudogap in the density of states , disordered local moments , and a large residual resistivity . at even weaker interaction one",
    "recovers the non magnetic band semimetal .",
    "thermal fluctuations destroy the ` spin - liquid ' correlations in the insulating state , converting the system to an uncorrelated paramagnet .",
    "the low energy electronic density of states and the resistivity show a monotonic temperature dependence deep in the metallic and insulating phases , but a non monotonic character near the insulator - metal transition . a comparison with the rare - earth molybdates and iridates reveal a clear similarity in the resistivity , while detailed aspects of the magnetic state and magnetotransport are missed out .",
