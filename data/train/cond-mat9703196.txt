    "this review is about mesoscopic conductors , statistics of related physical quantities and their scaling behavior under change of the size of the conductor .",
    "a few words about the terms used here shall tell the reader what to expect .",
    "mesoscopic systems are intermediate between microscopic and macroscopic systems .",
    "the term goes back to van kampen and was widely used after a work on `` physics of mesoscopic systems '' by imry @xcite .",
    "mesoscopic conductors contain many ( e.g.  @xmath1 ) elementary objects like electrons and atoms . on the other hand their properties",
    "can not be obtained by using the _ thermodynamic limit _",
    "( volume and particle number going to infinity with fixed particle density ) .",
    "the thermodynamic limit is a convenient mathematical device in solid state theory if one is interested in material constants .",
    "in particular , in macroscopic conductors the conductivity , @xmath2 , is such a material constant and the conductance , @xmath3 , is then given by ohm s law , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the cross section of the conductor and @xmath6 its length .",
    "this ohmic behavior is to be expected once the system size ( denoted by one length @xmath6 ) is much larger than characteristic length scales ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "these are ( i ) the kinematic scale set by the de broglie wavelength @xmath7 or , for low temperatures , by the _ fermi wavelength _",
    "@xmath8 , ( ii ) the _ elastic mean free path _",
    "@xmath9 , which is the average distance an electron travels before its initial momentum relaxes and ( iii ) the _ phase coherence length _",
    "@xmath10 , which is the average distance an individual electron travels before its initial and final phases become incoherent .",
    "once the phase coherence length @xmath10 becomes _ larger _ than the system size the conductor can no longer be described by material constants .",
    "microscopic details of the conductor will then influence even global physical quantities like conductance such that measurements yield _ finger prints _ of the mesoscopic conductor .",
    "these finger prints are due to quantum mechanical interference effects .    since mesoscopic conductors contain many electrons one has to use a quantum statistical description for their thermodynamic and transport quantities . however , this is not the only aspect of statistics in mesoscopic conductors .",
    "apart from the electronic degrees of freedom the conductor contains other degrees of freedom which are responsible for resistivity to applied voltages . in the simplest case",
    "these are static fields caused by impurities , vacancies and dislocations in an otherwise ideal crystal lattice .",
    "also static inhomogeneous electric fields caused by surrounding media are responsible for resistivity .",
    "one refers to these static fields as _",
    "static disorder potentials_. for different realizations of a static disorder potential the global conductance of an otherwise identical mesoscopic conductor will differ  sometimes significantly .",
    "therefore , one considers ensembles of disorder potentials characterized by a few parameters , e.g. by the average mean free path on short scales .",
    "the task of the theory is then to determine the _ probability distribution _ of physical quantities like conductance for such ensembles .",
    "thus , on top of the quantum statistical treatment for an individual disorder potential the statistical properties of a whole ensemble of disorder potentials is addressed in mesoscopic physics .",
    "typically , the phase coherence length is of the order of a few microns for metals and semi - conductors below liquid - helium temperatures .",
    "this is the reason that technological advances , starting in the 80 s , were needed in order to study mesoscopic conductors systematically .",
    "we will discuss some of the fundamental experiments in section [ mes ] .    although it is true that technological advances were needed to bring mesoscopic physics to the attention of a broader community in solid state physics , a great deal of the physics had been discussed much earlier .",
    "for example , anderson had introduced the idea of _ localization _ already in 1958 @xcite . by localization",
    "it is meant that strong disorder can trap electrons by quantum interference to a finite region such that the conductor actually behaves as an insulator .",
    "also , landauer had presented a formula in 1957 @xcite that describes the conductance of a phase coherent conductor in terms of pure quantum mechanical transmission amplitudes , and a similar important approach to the conductance of mesoscopic systems goes back to works in 1972 by edwards and thouless @xcite .",
    "the works by edwards and thouless @xcite and by wegner @xcite form the starting point of the _ scaling theory _ for mesoscopic conductors . later in 1979",
    "it was formulated in a simple and predictive way by abrahams , anderson , licciardello and ramakrishnan @xcite . the scaling theory for disordered mesoscopic conductors",
    "is based on the assumption that the transport properties of systems probed at scales much larger than the mean free path should become insensitive to the microscopic origin of the disorder .",
    "the scaling theory states that once we know the conductance for a given system size we can obtain the conductance for an even larger system from a universal flow equation .",
    "now , since we have already pointed out that the conductance is a random variable which depends in a complicated manner on the particular disorder realization this assumption needs further explanation . as has been stressed by anderson _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and later by shapiro @xcite it can be correct only in a probabilistic sense .",
    "the whole probability distribution of the conductance approaches a universal distribution function which depends only on very few characteristic system parameters .",
    "the scaling theory leads to a classification of mesoscopic electron systems into three classes : depending on the initial values of the characteristic system parameters ( called scaling variables ) for a system size @xmath11 the system will flow under increase of system size to an insulating state ( localized phase ) , or to an conducting state ( delocalized phase ) , or it stays scale independent at a _ critical state _ .",
    "thus a disorder induced transition from a localized to a delocalized phase can occur which resembles a critical phenomenon .",
    "this transition is frequently denoted as anderson transition or metal - insulator transition ( mit ) . to distinguish this disorder induced mit from other mits occurring in solid state physics",
    "we adopt the notion of _ localization - delocalization _ ( ld ) transition .",
    "accordingly , the critical point is referred to as the ld transition point .",
    "the central aim of this article is to provide a unique picture about the ld transition in mesoscopic disordered electron systems . to achieve this aim",
    "we will introduce the basic physical quantities , scales and theoretical models and rely on simple calculations avoiding involved technical details .",
    "we stress general concepts and methods such as quantum composition rules for conductors , fokker planck equations , and scaling laws for distribution functions .",
    "important results that are based on technically more elaborate methods will only be quoted without detailed description .",
    "nevertheless , we hope that the present article will help to find a way through the original literature .",
    "a number of reviews and books exist on related subjects discussed in this article .",
    "the following short list shall help for further reading .",
    "the review by y. imry @xcite is an introduction to mesoscopic physics .",
    "a review on the subject of mesoscopic transport that contains also information about the technological aspect of devices was written by beenakker and van houten @xcite .",
    "the book by datta @xcite on `` electronic transport in mesoscopic physics '' covers many subjects that have proved to be relevant in the field . as review on localization and scaling theory for mesoscopic systems",

    "the electronic aharonov - bohm - effect makes the definition of mesoscopic conductors more precise .",
    "universal conductance fluctuations demonstrate the _ finger - print _ character of mesoscopic conductance measurements and experiments on weak and strong localization point to the necessity of a critical phenomenon description of the ld transitions .",
    "basic physical quantities are the linear response quantities such as conductance . these and the corresponding relevant energy and length scales are the subject of sect .",
    "[ bas ] . to discuss the statistical problem inherent in the problem of mesoscopic conductors we introduce hamiltonian models in sect .",
    "there we will see that the green s function contains the essential information .",
    "only the asymptotic behavior of the green s function is needed for describing global conductances resulting in a scattering theoretical formulation of mesoscopic conductors ( sect .",
    "[ sca ] ) .",
    "this point of view has been particular useful in describing strong localization in so - called quasi - one - dimensional systems .",
    "however , the scattering theoretical modeling is not restricted to this case but can be extended to more general geometries by considering networks of scattering matrices . after the basic quantities and tools have been presented we discuss the statistical properties of mesoscopic conductors in the idealized localized and delocalized phase , respectively ( sect .",
    "[ staide ] ) . to prepare for the statistics in more realistic systems we introduce the concept of the scaling theory in sect .",
    "the flow of the relevant scaling variables is controlled by so - called @xmath12-functions from which a critical exponent for the ld transitions can be obtained .",
    "it describes how the correlation length of this critical phenomenon diverges on approaching the ld transition point .",
    "based on a pedagogical model , introduced by shapiro ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , we emphasize that typical values of the conductance distribution can be good candidates for scaling variables .",
    "we pay special attention to the statistics of local quantities ( like the local density of states ) that show power law scaling in non - localized phases .",
    "we come to the conclusion that , at the ld transition , a spectrum of power law exponents ( called multifractal spectrum ) is needed in order to describe the distribution .",
    "the more realistic models are the subject of sect .",
    "[ starea ] .",
    "the onset of broad distributions characterizing global and local quantities at large , but finite , values of typical conductance leaves open questions about their interpretation . to clarify some of them the conductance distribution in an idealized quasi - one - dimensional geometry is studied .",
    "the idealization is due to the assumption of absence of transversal diffusion in such systems .",
    "the calculations give useful insight into the physics of universal conductance fluctuations and lead to the interpretation that the onset of broad tails in the conductance distribution is intimately connected to the critical regime of the ld transition .",
    "such regime , as well as long tails in the conductance distribution , is absent in the idealized quasi - one - dimensional conductor .",
    "giving up the idealization , one can study the ld transition in quasi - one - dimensional systems by the so - called finite size scaling method . due to the complexity of calculations for non - ideal quasi - one - dimensional systems the finite size scaling method",

    "similarly , we collect arguments that allow to view the typical conductance as the _ only _ relevant scaling variable .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in sect .",
    "[ sum ] and a brief account of linear response theory is given in the appendix sect .",
    "in this section we will discuss some fundamental mesoscopic experiments without paying much attention to historical order and completeness .",
    "rather , we wish to give motivation to the following sections which are based on a theoretical physicists point of view .    the electronic aharonov - bohm - effect can be used for a definition of mesoscopic conductors .",
    "it is our starting point of investigations .",
    "it points to the necessity for a quantum mechanical description of transport .",
    "the need to describe physical quantities in terms of distribution functions rather than in terms of material constants became evident after the discovery of universal conductance fluctuations .",
    "that one conductor can behave both , as a perfect conductor and as a perfect insulator , when changing system parameters is the insight coming from experiments on weak and strong localization .",
    "weak localization refers to a situation where the system is metallic , but the conductivity is reduced as compared to its classical value .",
    "this behavior is interpreted as a precursor of the strong localization phenomenon where the system is insulating due to spatial localization of electronic states .",
    "weak localization effects have been found in various materials .",
    "the experimental verification of strong localization is most clear - cut in the quantum hall effect , and first experimental investigations of fluctuations at the ld transition point have been performed .      a ring - shaped conductor shown schematically in fig .",
    "2 with wire thickness of @xmath13  nm and a diameter of @xmath14  nm that was etched out of a high quality polycrystalline gold film of thickness @xmath13  nm was used to perform the first realization of the most fundamental experiment in mesoscopic physics , the electronic aharonov - bohm - effect . at temperatures less than @xmath15",
    "k the resistance oscillates as a function of the magnetic flux enclosed by the ring @xcite .",
    "figure  3 shows the result for the resistance oscillations found in a ring - shaped conductor fabricated in high mobility gaas - al gaas heterostructures performed by timp _",
    "_ @xcite . here",
    "the diameter of the ring is @xmath16  m. the period in the magnetic field ( @xmath17  mt ) corresponds to a periodicity in the magnetic flux enclosed by the ring of one flux quantum @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the elementary charge of an electron and @xmath20 is planck s constant .",
    "the qualitative explanation of the oscillations relies on the concept that electrons in a magnetic field @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the vector potential , pick up a quantum mechanical phase , @xmath23 when they move along a classical path @xmath24 that connects two points in space .",
    "now , for an electron coming from the current source the path splits up into the upper and lower branch of the ring and the phase difference @xmath25 between both paths is given by the total magnetic flux @xmath26 enclosed by the ring @xmath27 in terms of the the flux quantum @xmath28 the phase difference is @xmath29 . taking for granted that the resistance is sensitive to quantum interference of electronic waves",
    "the periodicity of the resistance is given by @xmath30 .",
    "the electronic aharonov - bohm - effect demonstrates that the electrons are to be treated quantum mechanically along the ring and that their initial phase is not randomized before leaving the ring .",
    "this phenomenon is called phase coherence and the aharonov - bohm - effect gives rise to an operative definition of the phase coherence length @xmath10 ( see also  sect .",
    "[ subrel ] ) . on increasing the temperature or the diameter of the ring",
    "the phase coherence gets lost and the aharanov - bohm effect disappears .",
    "the system size at which the aharanov - bohm effect ( gradually ) disappears quantifies the temperature dependent phase coherence length @xmath10 .",
    "the disappearance of the aharanov - bohm effect is caused by an increasing number of inelastic scattering events which destroy the phase coherence .",
    "the average distance of inelastic scattering events can be identified with @xmath10 .",
    "measurements of conductance in mesoscopic systems that have been performed since the 80 s , showed sample specific , reproducible , statistical fluctuations when system parameters like fermi energy , magnetic field or disorder configurations were changed @xcite . in figure  4",
    "the results of a recent experiment are shown .",
    "gold - nanowires of very high purity with cross - section @xmath31  nm@xmath32 and lengths between @xmath33 and @xmath34  nm were used .",
    "the conductance @xmath3 was measured as a function of applied magnetic field below @xmath35  t in steps of @xmath15  mt at @xmath36  mk .",
    "although the average conductance varies from @xmath37  @xmath38 ( for @xmath39  nm ) to @xmath40 ( for @xmath41  nm ) , the variance of the conductance stayed constant and was @xmath42 .",
    "this phenomenon is referred to as _ universal conductance fluctuations _ ( ucf ) . in a mesoscopic conductor with high conductance ( in atomic units @xmath38 )",
    "the conductance fluctuations are reproducible _ finger - prints _ of the conductor . however , the variance turns out to be approximately a constant @xmath43 two aspects of ucf are interesting : reproducibility and universality . that the fluctuations are reproducible can be understood again by a semiclassical description of conducting electrons .",
    "consider electrons moving along classical paths between elastic collisions , but having a quantum mechanical phase attached .",
    "since the phase information is not lost over distances of the phase coherence length ( mesoscopic regime ) a sample specific interference pattern arises .",
    "the interference pattern will be altered e.g. by applying a magnetic field .",
    "this gives rise to reproducible conductance fluctuations .",
    "the fact that the order of magnitude of these fluctuations turns out to be independent of the average conductance and does only depend weakly on dimensionality and symmetry properties of the conductor is , however , not easy to understand without having a transport theory of mesoscopic conductors .",
    "a striking consequence of the phenomenon is that mesoscopic conductors can not be characterized by an average conductivity being a material constant , even if the system size @xmath44 becomes very large .",
    "conductivity @xmath2 is related to conductance by ohm s law . for a cubic geometry",
    "the conductance behaves as @xmath45 .",
    "for ucf the relative fluctuations of conductance are @xmath46 which is in contrast to the classical behavior @xmath47 .",
    "thus , even in 3d metallic systems the relative fluctuations are much stronger than @xmath48 .",
    "early measurements of conductivity of amorphous silicon @xcite showed that , at low enough temperatures , the temperature behavior of conductivity follows mott s @xmath49-law , @xmath50 over two orders of magnitude with some constants @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( see fig .",
    "this behavior of the conductivity could be understood when assuming that the transport is mediated by phonon assisted hopping processes between localized states @xcite .",
    "localized states are spatially localized to some finite volume within the conductor .",
    "the finite volumes are characterized by a localization radius @xmath53 .",
    "the phonon assisted hopping is possible because localized states can be energetically close to each other if the corresponding localization centers are separated by distances much larger than the localization radius .",
    "the observation of mott s law made it clear that electronic states can indeed be localized by disorder which has been pointed out by anderson @xcite much earlier .",
    "the effect is referred to as _",
    "strong localization _ since the localization radius is smaller than system size .",
    "a further experimental hint to localization came from weakly disordered metallic films at low temperatures .",
    "they showed a logarithmic increase of resistance when the temperature is decreased ( see fig .",
    "although the system behaves metallic with large conductance the conductance was lower than its classical value .",
    "the effect was interpreted as being due to quantum interference corrections to classical transport and is referred to as _",
    "weak localization_. in weak localization the localization length is larger than system size but the effect is interpreted as a precursor of strong localization , i.e.  under further increase of system size ( while still being mesoscopic , i.e  @xmath44 ) the system would show strong localization .",
    "this is , of course , in practice very hard to realize when localization lengths are larger than microns .    the weak localization effect ( predicted by gorkov _ et al .",
    "@xcite ) can be explained by the phenomenon of _ enhanced backscattering _ due to quantum interference .",
    "it relies on the fact that the quantum coherent probability of the sum of two probability amplitudes @xmath54 is two times larger than the incoherent sum of the corresponding probabilities , @xmath55 .",
    "consider the chance for an electron traveling in a phase coherent conductor ( see fig .  1 )",
    "to return back to some point within the conductor . in fig",
    "7 a possible path is drawn for such a path ( straight line ) .",
    "if the motion is time reversal symmetric also the time reversed path ( broken line ) is possible .",
    "the amplitudes of both paths add coherently in a semiclassical calculation of the return probability .",
    "thus , the quantum mechanical return probability is twice the classical value . without explicitly calculating the conductivity it is obvious from this observation that the conductivity must be reduced as compared to its classical value .",
    "the coherence is limited by the phase coherence length @xmath10 which varies as some inverse power of temperature , @xmath56 for system sizes @xmath6 _ larger _ than the phase coherence length @xmath57 the logarithmic corrections to the classical conductivity could be interpreted as being due to the quantity @xmath58 where @xmath9 is the average elastic mean free path .",
    "magnetic fields destroy the time reversal symmetry of the electronic motion and thus the weak localization effect vanishes ( see upper set of fig .",
    "8) a very interesting effect is due to spin - orbit scattering processes that are time reversal symmetric . in this case",
    "the time reversed path , however , gives rise to destructive interference in the return probability . as a result",
    "the sign of the conductance corrections is reversed ( see lower set of fig .",
    "8) and the enhancement of conductivity above its classical value is denoted as _ weak anti - localization _",
    "( first predicted by hikami _",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "weak localization experiments are an important tool e.g. to determine the phase coherence length @xmath10 and the spin - orbit scattering length . for more details",
    "we refer to the review by bergmann @xcite .    to reach experimentally the regime of strong localization where the localization radius is less than the system size @xmath44 one has to use strongly disordered systems or work in energy regions with very low density of states .",
    "localization - delocalization ( ld ) transitions have been observed in several experiments ( for reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "figure  9 shows the finding of an experiment by stupp _",
    "@xcite indicating that the conductivity vanishes on approaching a critical charge carrier concentration .",
    "a major problem in comparing theoretical models with the experiments comes from the fact that in the low density of states regimes coulomb interaction between electrons becomes essential , but most theoretical models are based on an independent electron picture .    the most clear - cut experiment for the occurrence of ld transitions is the quantum hall effect discovered by von klitzing @xcite .",
    "the quantum hall effect that occurs in two - dimensional electron gases in the presence of strong perpendicular magnetic fields is characterized by a step - function like behavior of the hall conductivity @xmath59 as a function of the so called filling factor ( a dimensionless quantity proportional to carrier concentration and inverse magnetic field ) and by a vanishing dissipative conductivity @xmath2 in the hall plateau regimes ( see fig .",
    "10 ; note , that for non - vanishing hall conductivity a vanishing dissipative conductivity causes also a vanishing longitudinal resistivity . ) .",
    "the peaks in the dissipative conductivity as a function of the filling factor have a clear interpretation in terms of ld transitions .",
    "however , no metallic phase exists .",
    "all states , except for those at _ critical fillings _ where the localization radius is larger than system size , are strongly localized .",
    "the systems showing the quantum hall effect ( quantum hall systems ) are well suited to study the properties of critical states .",
    "recently , in an experiment by cobden and kogan @xcite it was possible to extract the whole conductance distribution at criticality for a truly mesoscopic quantum hall system .",
    "the main finding was a conductance distribution which is independent of system size ( within the mesoscopic regime ) , almost uniform between @xmath60 and @xmath38 .",
    "this means in particular that the fluctuations are of the same order as the average value .",
    "thus , fluctuations in the conductance can become much stronger than one could expect from classical transport theory where the relative fluctuations scale like the square root of the inverse volume .",
    "this section prepares for the discussion of transport theory in mesoscopic electron systems .",
    "we introduce the basic physical quantities of disordered mesoscopic systems for which the phase coherence length is larger than the system size .",
