    "in a recent preprint @xcite , yao et al . reported large - scale quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations of the superfluid - bose glass ( sf - bg ) transition for two different models of disordered bosons in three dimensions : a ) hardcore bosons with a random chemical potential uniformly distributed over a box @xmath5 $ ] , and whose transition is driven either by a varying average chemical potential @xmath6 , or by disorder at fixed , _",
    "zero _ average chemical potential ; b ) a link - current model with the same form of disorder , and with fixed _ zero _ average chemical potential .",
    "they report a striking difference in the scaling of the critical temperature @xmath7 for condensation as a function of the distance from the @xmath8 quantum critical point - qcp - @xmath9 , when the latter qcp is traversed following two different protocols    * protocol ( 1 ) : at fixed @xmath10 and variable chemical potential @xmath6 ; * protocol ( 2 ) : at fixed , _",
    "zero _ @xmath6 and variable @xmath10 .",
    "in particular they report that , following the protocol ( 1 ) , @xmath11 , with @xmath12 , while , following the protocol ( 2 ) , @xmath13 , with @xmath14 .",
    "yao et al .",
    "attribute this strong difference to the fact that protocol ( 2 ) is indeed observing the correct , asymptotic scaling of @xmath7 as @xmath15 , because the whole protocol operates at _ fixed average density _",
    "@xmath16 due to the average particle - hole symmetry associated with the choice @xmath17 . on the other hand",
    "the scaling behavior observed with protocol ( 1 ) is interpreted as a  transient \" behavior ( in the words of yao et al . ) , by which they mean that the behavior is not universal because it is too far from the quantum critical point .",
    "in particular the true scaling behavior would not be revealed because the density changes significantly with respect to the finite density @xmath18 at the qcp when the chemical potential is varied .",
    "most importantly , the scaling theory of the sf - bg transition of fisher et al .",
    "@xcite postulates that the universal scaling function of the free energy around the qcp depends on the temperature only through the ratio @xmath19 ( @xmath20 being the distance to the qcp ) , implying that @xmath21 .",
    "this relationship is verified by the estimates of the critical exponents of yao et al .",
    "@xcite , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , consistent ( only roughly for @xmath2 ) with previous estimates in the literature @xcite .",
    "the agreement with the simplest possible scaling theory of the sf - bg transition @xcite is therefore a tantalizing aspect to conclude that the exponent observed with the protocol ( 2 ) is indeed the correct one .",
    "remarkably , an exponent @xmath24 , consistent with what yao et al .",
    "observe within protocol ( 1 ) , has been reported in recent numerical studies on quantum spin realizations of the sf - bg transition @xcite with significantly different forms of disorder ( site dilution vs. bond and anisotropy disorder ) , as well as in a series of recent experiments on doped quantum magnets in a magnetic field ( acting as chemical potential ) , supposed to possess the same symmetries as those of a lattice - boson hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "all the above cited simulations and experiments have been performed using protocol ( 1 ) .",
    "hence the conclusions of yao et al .",
    "@xcite would imply that the above studies are affected by significant limitations , and are only observing effective exponents , as they do not approach the qcp sufficiently close to avoid the effects of a varying density .    in the present comment",
    "we would like to point out the following issues :    1 .",
    "yao et al .",
    "do not provide convincing evidence that the @xmath25 exponent obtained by them via the protocol ( 1 ) is a  transient \" one .",
    "in fact a more detailed analysis shows that their data consistently indicate an exponent @xmath26 .",
    "overall their simulations agree with the previous studies performed with protocol ( 1 ) , which strengthens the argument that an exponent @xmath25 might be a robust feature of the onset of @xmath7 around the sf - bg qcp when tuning the transition via the chemical potential ; 2 .",
    "the criterion of a ( nearly ) fixed density across the transition ( hereafter called the _ density criterion _ ) is critically re - examined .",
    "we show that the data of ref .",
    "are in fact complying with the criterion @xmath27 over a temperature range sufficiently broad to rule out an exponent @xmath28 ; moreover , they are fully complying with the conventional criterion for the proximity to the qcp , imposed on the actual driving parameter of the transition , @xmath29 . in the case of the disorder - driven transition of protocol ( 2 )",
    ", one should equivalently apply a `` disorder criterion '' @xmath30 .",
    "in fact , using the smallness of the parameters @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 as a quality factor for the numerical simulations of the scaling of @xmath7 around the qcp , we find that the results of ref .   are of comparable , better , or even substantially better quality than the results of yao et al .",
    "the aim of this comment is not to criticize the quantum monte carlo simulations of yao et al . , which are undoubtedly solid , but rather their conclusions .",
    "phase diagram of 3d hardcore - boson in a random chemical potential , with the location of the sf - bg transitions ( blue and red arrow , following protocols ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) respectively ) considered by yao et al .",
    "our first remark concerns the global phase diagram of the model of disordered bosons investigated by yao et al . , and the specific locations of the sf - bg transitions that yao et al .",
    "studied in details .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model is @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 are hardcore - boson operators , @xmath37 and @xmath38 is randomly distributed within the box @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "the @xmath8 phase diagram of the above model - as emerging from well - known results and from the results of yao et al .",
    "- is schematized in fig .",
    "[ f.hcb ] ; notice the similarity to the phase diagram of free fermions in a random box potential @xcite .",
    "we observe that while protocol ( 1 ) - as described in the introduction - corresponds to crossing the sf - bg transition at a rather  generic \" transition point , protocol ( 2 ) corresponds to a very special point in the phase diagram , namely it lies along the line @xmath17 , at which the average density @xmath39 is fixed at @xmath16 for _ any value of the disorder _ and _ for any finite temperature_. this property is related to an _ average _ particle - hole symmetry - not an exact symmetry on any finite - size system , but a symmetry valid on average over disorder , and , due to the self - averaging nature of the density , an _ exact _ symmetry in the thermodynamic limit . as we will further point out , the existence of such a special point is closely related to the hardcore nature of the bosonic particles .",
    "due to its special location at the tip of the sf lobe in the phase diagram , the transition point represents the sf - bg transition taking place at _ maximum strength of disorder _ for the model in question , and taking place for the _ maximum value of the density _",
    "( here to be understood as density _ modulo _ one , whence @xmath16 is the maximum possible value . ) the observation by yao et al . of an exponent @xmath40 consistent with",
    "the relationship @xmath21 is limited to this particular point in the phase diagram",
    ".          refs .   have considered on the other hand a theoretical model of disordered @xmath41 spins , capturing most of the features of the magnetic behavior of doped dichloro - tetrakis - thiourea nickel ( dtn ) . in particular , br doping of dtn is modeled via a correlated bimodal distribution of the magnetic bonds along the crystallographic @xmath42-axis and of the single - ion anisotropies @xcite .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian reads @xmath43 here @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) are @xmath41 spin operators , coupled on a cubic lattice with antiferromagnetic interactions @xmath46 along the @xmath42 axis and @xmath47 in the @xmath48 plane ; @xmath49 is a strong single - ion anisotropy . in pure dtn",
    "@xmath50 k , @xmath51 k , @xmath52 k.@xcite doping at a concentration @xmath53 is modeled as increasing the @xmath46 bond strength to @xmath54 on a fraction @xmath55 of the @xmath42-axis bonds , and reducing the single anisotropy @xmath49 to @xmath56 on one of the two ions connected by the bond . in particular",
    "we find that @xmath57 allows this model to reproduce the magnetization curve of br - dtn at @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "when mapped @xcite onto softcore bosons with maximum occupancy @xmath59 , the above model provides a valuable example of a 3d dirty - boson system , for which a sf - bg transition can be controlled e.g. by varying the magnetic field ( which acts as a chemical potential ) or by varying the disorder . in experiments ,",
    "only the magnetic field can be continuously tuned , however in the theoretical model we can continuously tune the br substitution from 0 to 100% , leading to the phase diagram that we sketch in fig .",
    "[ f.dtn ] . there",
    "the sf - bg transitions explored in ref .",
    "are two protocol-(1 ) transitions tuned by the magnetic field /chemical potential .",
    "as we will discuss later in more details , the two transitions occur at very different densities : a very low density @xmath60 around the lower critical field @xmath61 , and a more sizable density @xmath62 at the upper critical field @xmath63 . due to the special nature of the disorder induced by  theoretical \" br doping - that of lowering the local spin - gap around the dopants - one finds that doping enhances the sf region of the phase diagram .",
    "therefore a transition point of maximum density ( @xmath64 ) and maximum disorder strength as in the hardcore boson system is not present in the model for br - dtn .",
    "exact _ particle - hole symmetry is featured along the @xmath65 line , where @xmath66 ( on _ each _ site of the lattice for any size , temperature or disorder strength ) .",
    "along such line the bg is replaced by a mott - glass phase , whose transition to a sf belongs potentially to a different universality class than the sf - bg transition , and therefore we shall not consider it here .     vs. @xmath6 data of the protocol-(1 ) transition of yao et al .",
    "the last plot shows the fit with @xmath67.,width=226 ]",
    "yao et al . fit their @xmath7-vs.-@xmath6 data at the protocol-(1 ) transition for the hamiltonian eq .",
    "with the form @xmath68 with @xmath69 and @xmath70 as fitting parameters , and @xmath0 _ fixed _ at the value 1.1 .",
    "they conclude that their data are inconsistent with this fitting form because the lowest - temperature point falls slightly outside the fitting curve .",
    "their mistake is in assuming that @xmath0 is precisely 1.1 . in previously simulations and experiments ,",
    "@xmath4 with different error bars around 10% . with a slightly different choice of @xmath0 within that window of error bars",
    ", their data fits to a single power law with no deviation ( fig .",
    "[ f.window ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we perform a windowing analysis on their result to extrapolate the exponent to the critical point . a fitting analysis over a variable window of chemical potentials @xmath71 $ ] ( where @xmath72 is set to the minimum chemical potential of the data , and @xmath73 is varied ) shows that their results are indeed consistent with a @xmath74 , in agreement with the previous analyses @xcite of sf - bg transitions following protocol ( 1 ) performed on different models - see fig .",
    "[ f.window ] .     thus taking yao et al s data together with previous results",
    ", a @xmath0 exponent appears to emerge for widely different models with different forms of disorder : a random - box chemical potential in ref .  , bond and single - ion - anisotropy randomness in ref .  , site dilution in ref .",
    "this would suggest that such an exponent is a robust feature of the transition .",
    "the conclusion of yao et al .",
    "is rather different : they interpret their protocol-(1 ) data as showing a  transient \" exponent , due to the fact that the density of bosons changes significantly along the @xmath7-vs-@xmath6 critical line .",
    "they conclude that for transitions with changing density , the correct @xmath0 exponent is revealed only for temperatures @xmath75 and chemical potentials @xmath6 such that @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the density at the quantum critical point . in particular ,",
    "yao et al .",
    "concude that , given that _ their _ data with variable density show an exponent @xmath78 and do not comply with the criterion @xmath79 , then _ all _ previous experiments and calculations consistent with the same exponent must be affected by the limitation of having a variable density . in the following we challenge the criterion @xmath80 , and show additional unpublished data even closer to the quantum critical point that supports the exponent @xmath4 .    .",

    "a common criterion to define proximity to the qcp crossed at fixed disorder and variable chemical potential ( protocol ( 1 ) ) would be @xmath81 , which is indeed satisfied by the protocol-(1 ) data of yao et al . , as well as by the data of refs .",
    "the density criterion of yao et al .",
    ", on the other hand , imposes that not only the driving parameter ( @xmath6 ) be close to the critical value @xmath70 , but that also its conjugate variable ( @xmath39 ) be close to its value @xmath18 at criticality .",
    "this is a rather unusual criterion when applied to known , more standard transitions than the one at hand .",
    "it turns out to be much more restrictive than the conventional criterion - for instance , such a criterion would imply that the critical region is of _ zero width _ for transitions with a divergent compressibility , such that an infinitesimal change of chemical potential away from the critical point entails a substantial change in the density .",
    "nonetheless , the density criterion of yao et al . would justify the difference in the @xmath0-exponent estimates between transitions following protocol ( 1 ) vs. protocol ( 2 ) . in the latter protocol , as already explained above , the average density is strictly constant for any disorder strength and temperature . here",
    "we re - examine the qmc data of refs .   for the model eq .   in the light of the density criterion",
    ", and we show that _ data satisfying the density criterion do not in turn exhibit a @xmath0 exponent consistent with @xmath21 . _ in particular the data of ref",
    ".   lie closer to the qcp ( according to the density criterion ) than the data of yao et al . following protocol ( 2 ) ( according to an equivalent disorder criterion ) .",
    "hereafter we cite the temperature and magnetic field data for the theory model eq .   in _ physical units _ , in order to connect to the experimental data of br - dtn as well - even though we shall only exploit theory data .      in the case of the spin model for br - dtn , eq .   the density criterion takes the form of a _ magnetization _ criterion , @xmath83 , where @xmath84 .",
    "moreover , close to the saturation field , the density criterion must be described in terms of the distance to the saturation magnetization @xmath85 , namely @xmath86 . figs .",
    "[ f.dchc1 ] and [ f.dchc2 ] show the magnetization and the @xmath87 parameter along the critical line @xmath82 at finite temperature for the model of eq .",
    "both in the vicinity of the lower critical field @xmath88 t , and of the upper critical field @xmath89 t ( see ref .  ) . here",
    "@xmath90 is estimated as the density at the lowest accessed temperature , and for a system size @xmath91 - we check that the data in question are essentially devoid of thermal as well as finite - size effects .",
    "a first observation is that the two qcps correspond to two very different density / magnetization regimes : while the density at @xmath61 is very weak , @xmath92 , the density around @xmath63 is significantly bigger , @xmath93 . in both cases the magnetization",
    "is found to follow approximately a power law along the critical curve , @xmath94 with @xmath95 close to @xmath61 and @xmath96 close to @xmath63 ( a similar power law has been observed along the quantum critical trajectory above @xmath61 in ref .  ) .",
    "we observe that the data for the critical line reported in ref .   can indeed access regions with @xmath97 , where the correct scaling of @xmath7 vs. @xmath98 is supposed to be observed according to the density criterion of yao et al . indeed around @xmath61 our data clearly cover the region @xmath99 ( corresponding to @xmath100 mk ) while around @xmath63 they even access the region @xmath101 ( corresponding to @xmath102 mk ) .",
    "remarkably , the experimental data of ref .   have access as well the above cited regions .      fig .  [ f.dctc ]",
    "shows the critical lines around @xmath61 and @xmath63 for the model eq .   with the threshold values for the density - criterion parameter @xmath87 .",
    "we observe that , despite their sizable error bars , data close to @xmath61 can not be reconciled with an exponent @xmath103 even in the region in which @xmath99 .",
    "the latter conclusion applies even more strongly to the data close to @xmath63 for an @xmath87 as small as @xmath104 . in particular in ref .",
    "a @xmath0 exponent of @xmath105 close to @xmath63 was extracted from data with @xmath106 .",
    "there is no clear sign of a change of scaling upon reducing the temperature .",
    "this suggests that one observes a @xmath0 exponent that is consistently different from the prediction @xmath21 even when complying with the density criterion .",
    "the observation of an exponent @xmath107 is obtained for sf - bg transitions occurring at critical densities ( magnetizations ) @xmath18 ( @xmath90 ) which differ by almost three orders of magnitude between @xmath61 and @xmath63 - a remarkable fact in our opinion , which also shows how br - dtn can give access to two sf - bg transitions in rather different regimes .",
    "finally the reliability of the @xmath0-exponent estimates reported in ref .",
    "is further supported by the fact that the position of the qcps at @xmath61 and @xmath63 , obtained by extrapolation of the finite - temperature data of fig .",
    "[ f.dctc ] , is _ completely consistent _ with an independent estimate that is provided by a scaling analysis of qmc data @xcite obtained via an exponential cooling protocol ( @xmath108-doubling scheme @xcite ) .",
    "the latter approach enables us to systematically eliminate thermal effects from finite - size qmc data , without any _ a priori _ assumption on the dynamical critical exponent @xmath3 at the qcp .    concerning the distance to the critical field @xmath61 and @xmath63 , @xmath109 , the data used to extract the @xmath0 exponent in ref .",
    "had @xmath110 close to @xmath61 and @xmath111 close to @xmath63 . in this respect , the data of yao et al . for protocol ( 2 )",
    "are of lower quality according to the disorder parameter for the distance to the critical point , @xmath112 .",
    "in fact the fit which leads to the estimated exponent @xmath113 is based on 4 points in a region with @xmath114 for the link - current model ( fig .",
    "5 of ref .  ) and on 4 points in a region which has again @xmath114 for the hardcore - boson model ( fig .",
    "6 of ref .  ) .",
    "hence we can conclude that the existing numerical data supporting @xmath107 are of _ better _ quality - according to the @xmath32 parameter as well as to the ( more restrictive ! ) density criterion based on the @xmath115 parameter - than the data produced by yao et al .",
    "in support of @xmath113 - according to the @xmath33 parameter .     vs. @xmath98 around @xmath61 ( left panel ) and @xmath63 ( right panel ) for the model of br - doped dtn .",
    "the dashed lines indicate relevant thresholds for the density ( magnetization ) criterion .",
    "the solid lines are fits to @xmath116 , with @xmath0 exponents in the legend .",
    "the open squares represent the estimates of the qcp @xmath117 and @xmath63 from @xmath108-doubling qmc data ( see the text).,width=340 ]",
    "in this note we have shown that previous theoretical data for a model of br - doped dtn - supporting a scaling of the critical temperature close to a 3d sf - bg transition with an exponent @xmath118 - satisfy the criterion of a nearly constant density which yao et al . in ref .   set as conditions for the observation of the actual asymptotic @xmath0 exponent .",
    "therefore the conclusion of the latter reference  that the observed value @xmath118 be a  transient \" value on the way to a value consistent with the relation @xmath21  is actually invalid on the basis of the data at hand . while our analysis strictly applies to the theory data of ref .",
    ", we can conjecture that a similar conclusion is also valid for much of the experimental data supporting a similar value of @xmath0 ( typically @xmath4 ) for other magnetic compounds which are strong candidates for the realization of the 3d sf - bg transitions @xcite .    to convincingly conclude that @xmath4 is a transient exponent",
    ", it would be necessary to demonstrate the crossover between the supposedly transient and the actual @xmath0 exponent .",
    "the observation of yao et al . of an exponent @xmath0",
    "consistent with the relationship @xmath21 is quite remarkable , but it remains limited at present to the case of a special point in the phase diagram of hardcore bosons . in the light of the above discussion ,",
    "fisher et al.s scaling ansatz , predicting @xmath21 , remains insufficient to explain the body of existing numerical and experimental results . as elaborated in ref .",
    ", the violation of the prediction @xmath21 implies unconventional scaling _ at finite temperature _ only , whose origin still remains to be clarified theoretically .",
    "further work - both theoretical and experimental - is therefore necessary to reconcile the observations of yao et al . at fixed density with the existing data at variable density .",
    "all these results further exhibit the complexity and the richness of the critical properties at the 3d sf - bg transition .",
