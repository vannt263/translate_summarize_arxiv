    "entanglement in disordered spin chains has received much attention recently @xcite .",
    "the main reason is that , as opposed to on - site disordered systems @xcite , long - distance correlations are not destroyed in this case , but only modified in subtle ways .",
    "thus , for the 1d heisenberg and xx models with uncorrelated random couplings , the von neumann entropy of blocks of size @xmath0 is known to violate the area law and grow as @xmath1 , similarly to the conformal case @xcite .",
    "the prefactor , nonetheless , is different : it is still proportional to the the central charge of the associated conformal field theory ( cft ) , but multiplied by an extra @xmath2 factor .",
    "moreover , the rnyi entropies do not satisfy the predictions of cft @xcite , because these models are not conformal invariant .",
    "a very relevant tool of analysis is the strong disorder renormalization group ( sdrg ) devised by dasgupta and ma @xcite , which shows that the ground state of heisenberg or xx chains with strong disorder can be written as a product of _ random singlets _ ,",
    "in which all spins are paired up making su(2 ) singlet bonds .",
    "furthermore , the renormalization procedure prevents the bonds from crossing , i.e. , the bond structure will always be _",
    "planar_. the paired spins are often neighbours , but not always .",
    "as it was shown @xcite , the probability distribution for the singlet bond lengths , @xmath3 falls as a power - law , @xmath4 , with @xmath5 .",
    "entanglement of a block can be obtained just by counting the number of singlets which must be cut in order to isolate the block , and multiplying by the entanglement entropy of one bond , which is @xmath2 .    under the sdrg flow ,",
    "the variance of the couplings increases and its correlation length decreases , thus approaching the so - called _ infinite randomness fixed point _ ( irfp ) @xcite .",
    "is this fixed point unique ?",
    "not necessarily .",
    "if the couplings present a diverging correlation length , we might have other fixed points of the sdrg .",
    "for example , if the couplings decay exponentially from the center , they give rise to the _ rainbow phase _ , in which singlets extend concentrically @xcite . in that case , all couplings are correlated .",
    "but we may also devise ensembles of couplings which present long - range correlations , but are still random",
    ".    a glimpse of some further fixed points can be found by observing the statistical mechanics of the secondary structure of rna @xcite . a simple yet relevant model is constituted by a closed 1d chain with an even number of rna bases , which we call sites , which are randomly coupled in pairs with indices of different parity @xcite .",
    "each pair constitutes an rna bond , and the only constraint is that no bonds can cross .",
    "therefore , the ensemble of secondary structures of rna can be described in terms of planar bond structures , just like ground states of disordered spin - chains .",
    "wiese and coworkers @xcite studied the probability distribution for the bond lengths , and found @xmath6 , with @xmath7 .",
    "furthermore , the studies of rna folding included a very interesting second observable .",
    "the planar bond structure can be mapped to the height function of a discretized interface @xcite .",
    "we can define the expected roughness of windows of size @xmath0 , @xmath8 , as the deviation of the height function over blocks of size @xmath0 , which can be shown to scale in rna folding structures like @xmath9 , with @xmath10 .",
    "interestingly , @xmath11 .",
    "as we will show , the interface roughness is very similar to the entanglement entropy of blocks of size @xmath0 , and they are characterized by similar exponents . in the irfp phase for random singlets , notice that the entropy is characterized by a zero exponent , due to the logarithmic growth , and @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , it is also true that @xmath11 .",
    "we may then ask , what is the validity of this scaling relation ? does the rna folding case correspond to some choice of the ensemble of coupling constants for a spin - chain ?",
    "can we obtain other fixed points which interpolate between the irfp and the rna folding cases ?",
    "we may keep in mind that the couplings in some spin chain models ( e.g. , the xx model ) can be mapped into modulations of the space metric @xcite .",
    "thus , we are obtaining , in a certain regime , the relation between the statistical structure of the space metric and the statistical properties of entanglement of the vacuum , i.e. , the ground state of the theory .",
    "this article is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : model ] introduces our model and the renormalization procedure used throughout the text .",
    "moreover , it discusses the consequences of the planarity of the pairing structures which characterize the states . in section [ sec : results ] we establish our strategy to sample highly correlated values of the couplings , and show numerically the behavior of the entropy and other observables . in section [ sec : rna ] we focus on the relation between the rna folding problem and our disordered spin chains , and determine an inverse algorithm to compute a parent hamiltonian for any planar state , exemplifying it with the rna folding states .",
    "how generic are planar states is the question addressed in section [ sec : generic ] , showing that they are non - generic through the study of their entanglement entropy .",
    "the article ends in section [ sec : conclusions ] discussing our conclusions and ideas for further work .",
    "let us consider for simplicity a spin-1/2 xx chain with @xmath12 ( even ) sites and periodic boundary conditions , whose hamiltonian is    @xmath13    where the @xmath14 are the coupling constants , which we will assume to be positive and strongly inhomogeneous .",
    "more precisely , we assume that neighboring couplings are very different .",
    "notice that we do not impose them to be random .    in order to obtain the ground state ( gs ) , we can employ the _ strong disorder renormalization group _ ( sdrg ) method of dasgupta and ma @xcite . at each renormalization step , we pick the maximal coupling , @xmath14 , decimate the two associated spins , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and establish a _ singlet bond _ between them .",
    "the neighboring sites are then joined by an effective coupling given by second order perturbation theory :    @xmath17    among the next neighbours of the link , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "it is convenient to use a set of auxiliary variables , that we will call _ log - couplings _ : @xmath20 .",
    "the main reason is that , for them , the dasgupta - ma renormalization rule becomes _ additive _ :",
    "@xmath21    once the sdrg procedure is finished we can read our gs as a product state of _ singlet _ valence bonds .",
    "@xmath22    where @xmath23 denotes a set of @xmath24 pairing bonds among the @xmath12 spins .",
    "many properties of these ground states have been studied in the last thirty years @xcite .",
    "one of the most salient of those properties is the fact that the pairing @xmath23 which results from the renormalization procedure _ must be planar _ ,",
    "i.e. , it can be drawn without any two bonds crossing .",
    "states of the form which fulfill this requirement will be called from now on _",
    "planar states_.      in more formal terms , let ( even ) @xmath12 be the number of nodes , and a bond is defined as an ordered pair @xmath25 , where @xmath26 are the nodes joined . in principle , @xmath27 .",
    "we define the covered nodes by the bond as @xmath28 .",
    "notice that , if @xmath29 and @xmath30 are consecutive , @xmath31 . given two bonds , @xmath32 and @xmath33",
    ", we say that @xmath34 if @xmath35 .",
    "if neither @xmath36 or @xmath37 , we say that the bonds _ cross_. a planar bond structure is defined as a set of @xmath24 bonds which _ do not cross_. thus , the bonds form a _",
    "nested graph_. an important remark is that the two nodes joined by bond must have different parity .",
    "[ fig : illust ] for an illustration .",
    "let us assume that the nodes are indexed counterclockwise .",
    "we can now define for each node @xmath15 a value @xmath38 to be either @xmath39 or @xmath40 depending on whether it is the source or the sink of a bond , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : illust ] . of course",
    ", the sum of all the @xmath38 around the full system should be zero : @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath38 can be considered as _",
    "slopes _ of a height function ,    @xmath42    of course , this definition is not translation invariant , since we start counting at node 1 . in order to avoid that ,",
    "let @xmath43 denote the absolute minimum of this height function .",
    "then , we can define the _ absolute height function _",
    ", @xmath44 .",
    "its meaning is the following : it denotes the number of bonds passing above the link in the circle joining nodes @xmath15 and @xmath16 . by construction",
    ", this absolute height function has , at least , one zero .",
    "there is a close analogy between planar pairings and the _ dyck language _ @xcite .",
    "a dyck word is a string of symbols from the alphabet @xmath45 such that the number of @xmath46 counted from the left is always greater or equal to the number of @xmath47 .",
    "equivalently , they are the set of _ properly balanced _ parenthesis .",
    "this means that their height function @xmath48 , as defined in eq .",
    ", is positive for all @xmath15 .",
    "the difference between our planar pairings and the dyck language resides entirely in the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "if , in our _ circular _ planar structures , we break at the absolute minimum of the height function , the analogy with dyck words becomes complete .",
    "how many different planar states are there for a system of fixed size @xmath49 ?",
    "let us denote this value by @xmath50 . disregarding the ordering of the sites in each bond , which merely contributes a general @xmath51 factor",

    "@xmath66 represents the bonds that _ enter _ the block from its left end , and @xmath67 the bonds which exit from its right . for an example , see fig .",

    "the number of bonds entering from the left is @xmath69 , and the number of bonds leaving from the right is @xmath70 .",
    "but not all those bonds contribute to the entropy .",
    "some of them just _ fly over _ the block , and we can separate the block without touching them .",
    "let @xmath71 be the number of those flying bonds , in our example @xmath72 , the bond from site 1 to site 8 .",
    "the links entering from the left , @xmath66 are either overflying ( @xmath71 ) or not ( @xmath73 ) : @xmath74 .",
    "similarly , on the right we have @xmath75 , and the block entropy is given by @xmath76",
    ". we will proceed to prove that @xmath71 is given by the minimum of the height function inside the block .",
    "since the bonds which contribute to the entropy , @xmath73 and @xmath77 , do not _ fly _ over the block , they must either _ end _ inside it ( @xmath73 ) or _ start _ inside it @xmath77 . since the bonds can not cut , the @xmath73 bonds from the left must have ended _ before _ any of the @xmath77 start . at that very moment , only the _ flying _ bonds will remain . in fig .",
    "[ fig : illust ] , this moment takes place between sites 5 and 6 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and the block entropy is @xmath80 .",

    "the main difference is that the entanglement entropy gives special relevance to the boundaries .",
    "the statistical properties of the ground states of hamiltonians of the form when the couplings @xmath83 are picked randomly and _ uncorrelated _ have been determined in a series of papers @xcite .",
    "the sdrg procedure converges to the so - called _ infinite randomness fixed point _ ( irfp ) . along the rg ,",
    "the variance of the effective couplings grow , and their correlation length decreases .",
    "it has been shown that the average entanglement entropy of a block of size @xmath0 follows the expression @xcite :    @xmath84    where @xmath85 is a scaling function and @xmath86 is the central charge of the associated cft , i.e. , the one which corresponds to the homogeneous ( conformal ) case , with all the @xmath14 equal . in our case , @xmath87 .",
    "surprisingly , expression is very similar to the conformal expression @xcite :    @xmath88    the scaling function @xmath85 is , in fact , rather similar to @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "another relevant observable which helps characterize the irfp is the _ bond - length _ probability , i.e. , given a singlet bond @xmath90 , determine the probability distribution for its length @xmath91 , @xmath92 .",
    "this value is directly related to the two - point correlation function @xcite . in the uncorrelated case ,",

    "our aim is to characterize the ground states of hamiltonian when the couplings @xmath14 are random , but present non - trivial correlations .",
    "if these correlations are short ranged , they will be washed away by the renormalization procedure , and return to the irfp .",
    "thus , we will consider the case of long - range correlations .",

    ", we just apply a correction to the rna folding sampling strategy . in the rna folding algorithm , the pair of sites @xmath90 which will constitute the next bond is chosen with equal probabilities among those which do not cut any previous bond .",
    "but , following that procedure , not all planar pairings are sampled with the same probability .",
    "this can be corrected if the probabilities for each pair @xmath90 are not equal , but proportional to the number of planar pairings which are consistent with the presence of that bond .",
    "let us consider a certain _ empty patch _ of length @xmath164 in a planar pairing which is under construction , i.e. , a set of contiguous spins which have not been paired yet . as we know , there are @xmath165 possible ways to create a planar pairing on that empty patch .",
    "the spin with index 1 must be paired with some spin inside the patch , let us refer to its index as @xmath97 .",
    "then , after bond @xmath166 is established , the number of different possible planar pairings will be @xmath167 .",
    "thus the probability with which bond @xmath166 should be taken is just @xmath168 , which is known to be less than one by construction , as we see in eq . .",
    "repeating this procedure , we can sample the planar pairing ensemble with equal probabilities .",
    "we have found numerically the average block entropy as a function of the block size @xmath0 for this ensemble of states , and found that it grows as @xmath169 , with @xmath170 .",
    "the precise value is not very relevant , but it allows us to conclude that planar states are highly non - generic quantum states , because for generic states we should obtain @xmath171 , i.e. , a volumetric growth of the entropy .",
    "in this article we have applied the sdrg to study the ground state properties of a strongly disordered random spin chain with long - range correlations between its couplings .",
    "the states can be described as valence bond states with planar bond structures , and they can have arbitrarily large entanglement entropy .",
    "concretely , we have chosen the couplings such that their logarithm is expressed as a fourier series with random coefficients , falling as a power - law of the momentum @xmath172 .",
    "for @xmath117 the behavior is very similar to the infinite randomness fixed point ( irfp ) found for uncorrelated coupling constants .",
    "nonetheless , for @xmath136 , the block entropy behaves as a power - law of the block size , @xmath173 , with @xmath124 a function of the exponent @xmath105 which seems to interpolate smoothly between @xmath174 and @xmath175 as @xmath111 .",
    "the bond length probability , which is related to the correlator , is also characterized by a power - law , @xmath6 , with @xmath5 for @xmath132 and falling to @xmath176 for @xmath111 .",
    "this extreme , @xmath111 , corresponds to the case where only the lowest momentum @xmath177 contributes to the correlation between the couplings , and the state becomes a _ rainbow state_. as we have shown , the planar states can be mapped to a 1d interface , whose roughness behaves approximately like the entanglement entropy , as it is suggested by expression .",
    "remarkably , the system described constitutes a family of local 1d hamiltonians whose ground states violate the area law to any desired degree .",
    "we have also considered the inverse renormalization problem : given a ( planar ) valence bond state , to obtain its ( 1d ) parent hamiltonian . in this way we were able to study the ensemble of random spin chains whose ground states would correspond to the planar structures which show up in other physical situations , such as the rna folding problem .",
    "these _ engineered _ random spin chains present a behavior of the entanglement entropy and the correlators which do not correspond to any value of @xmath105 .",
    "this suggests that the phase diagram of random spin chains with large correlations between the couplings is richer than expected .",
    "inhomogeneous spin chains can be mapped , in some cases , to models which represent the motion of fermionic matter on a curved spacetime @xcite , where the metric is given by the coupling constants .",
    "thus , our study shows that the statistical properties of the metric show up as statistical properties of the entanglement of the vacuum , i.e. , the ground state of the corresponding hamiltonian .",
    "moreover , we can also find , using the inverse renormalization algorithm , the optimal spatial geometry which gives rise to a certain vacuum entanglement .",
    "these results may shed light on the relation between entanglement and space - time @xcite .",
    "we would like to thank j. cuesta for insights into the statistical mechanics of rna folding .",
    "this work was funded by grants fis-2012 - 33642 and fis-2012 - 38866-c05 - 1 , from the spanish government , quitemad+ s2013/ice-2801 from the madrid regional government and sev-2012 - 0249 of the `` centro de excelencia severo ochoa '' programme .",
    "instead of using the minimal length of the bond , we can also employ their _ renormalized length _",
    ", i.e. , the number of links which were decimated in its formation during the sdrg procedure . as opposed to the minimal length , the renormalized length can be larger than @xmath178 .",
    "this alternative definition does not affect the computation of entropies , but it changes the heights and the bond - lengths .",
    "but the universal features described in this chapter were not changed , and thus we do not show specific results ."
