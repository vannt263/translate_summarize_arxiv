    "the theoretical analyses of the hadronic parity violation in few - nucleon systems were introduced by danilov @xcite and desplanques and missimer @xcite for the first time .",

    "the ddh potential is dominated by the exchange of light mesons as a sign of the long - distance physics .",
    "the inclusion of heavy @xmath14 and @xmath15 mesons in ddh model point out the short - distance physics . with these model assumptions ,",
    "the ddh potential has been widely used to calculate pv observables in terms of pv meson - exchange couplings for different few - body systems @xcite .",
    "the idea of the effective field theory ( eft ) and its application in low - energy parity violation is principally based on the fact that the long - distance physics should be independent of the details of the short - distance effects",
    ". therefore , the pv transition amplitudes with no reference to the description of the short - distance effects are appropriate in order to determine the pv observables .",
    "recently , the pv lagrangian of the weak nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath0 ) interaction of the pionless effective field theory ( eft(@xmath16 ) ) with five independent unknown low - energy coupling constants ( lecs ) has been incorporated to evaluate the following pv observables in terms of pv lecs in a unified eft(@xmath17 ) framework .",
