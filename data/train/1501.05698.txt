    "the standard model ( sm)-like higgs scalar with mass around 125 gev @xcite discovered at the lhc needs some mechanism for stabilizing it against high - energy scale quantum correction . among the well known candidates which achieve this naturally low - scale supersymmetry ( susy )",
    "is expected to play an important role at the tev scale .",
    "however , the first run of lhc has not observed any signal of new physics yet , and pushes the susy particle masses into multi - tevs region @xcite .",
    "so the absence of susy particles near the weak scale @xmath0 , together with the observed higgs mass , severely challenge the low - scale susy .    in the context of minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )",
    "stop masses far above the weak scale is required by the observed higgs mass when the mixing effect is weak .",
    "given susy mass spectrum far above the weak scale , the naturalness is spoiled naively . however , this statement can be relaxed in some specific situations .",
    "susy with focusing phenomenon @xcite , which is named as focus point susy , is few of such examples . in focus point",
    "susy the sensitivity of up - type higgs mass squared to the mass scale of susy mass spectrum is suppressed because of cancellation among the large renormalization group ( rg ) corrections .",
    "this phenomenon leads to a dramatical reduction of fine tuning associated with electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) . as a result",
    ", it provides us an alternative choice of natural susy consistent with the lhc data and the observed higgs mass .",
    "unfortunately , focus point susy can not be realized in the minimal setup from the viewpoint of model building such as conventional supergravity @xcite and the minimal gauge mediation ( gm ) @xcite .",
    "however , they are expected to be achieved in some subtle cases . for recent examples in the context of gm ,",

    "these examples are restricted to special susy - breaking mediation scale @xmath1 .    based on our earlier work @xcite",
    ", we will take an arbitrary @xmath1 and generalize results above to general focus point .",
    "consider the fact that the cold dark matter demands some electroweakino mass around the weak scale , we will focus on the high - scale susy in which gaugino masses are light in compared with other susy particle masses .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "firstly , we determine the conditions for focus point in susy with arbitrary @xmath1 in section ii .",

    "can be explained in a wide classes of high - scale susy models .",
    "the second part of this paper is devoted to the realization of focus point in high - scale susy . in section iv we will construct concrete and complete examples by employing non - minimal gm .",
    "we will show that for the case of small @xmath4 term focus point susy is viable for a wide range of @xmath1 , which generalizes previous results in the literature .",
    "for the case of large @xmath4 term , we find that focus point susy is viable in a large classes of gm with direct yukawa coupling between the messengers and the mssm singlet .    finally we discuss our results in section v. the calculation of soft masses is included in appendix a.",
    "we begin with the conditions for focus point in susy . given light gauginos , in compared with soft masses @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath2 and @xmath4 term squared , the one - loop renormalization group equations ( rges ) for them are simply given by , @xmath7 where @xmath8 , with @xmath9 the rg running scale and @xmath1 the susy - breaking mediation scale . here",

    "so , the significant reduction due to focus point seems to be spoiled for a small change of either @xmath154 or @xmath1 .",
    "however , this is not true . because only the overall magnitude of soft mass spectrum but not their relative ratios is determined by @xmath155 . as shown in eq.([condition ] ) the focusing condition eq.([mh ] ) is actually not dependent on either @xmath154 or @xmath1 , and only dependent on @xmath1 indirectly through rg effect .",

    "however , the number of feynman diagrams for calculating these soft scalar mass is usually large , which limits its application broadly . in @xcite a new technique is proposed , where the authors suggest analytical continuation into superspace @xmath156 in the renormalized wave function , where @xmath1 and @xmath154 refers to the messenger mass scale and the strength of susy breaking , respectively . nevertheless , this method is only valid for the standard spurion superfield @xmath157 and for the case of small susy breaking .",
    "therefore , for non - standard spurion field @xmath158 as studied in this paper , we have to evaluate feynman diagrams directly .",
    "by following the results @xcite for standard spurion @xmath157 in @xcite the authors have derived the soft scalar mass spectrum in the model defined in eq.([s2 ] ) , where it is crucial to establish the connection between the mass eigenstates of messenger fields in these two cases . following this insight",
    ", we derive the correction due to yukawa superpotential deformation eq.([def ] ) in terms of results in the standard gm with yukawa superpotential deformation eq.([def ] ) .    in terms of eq.([s2 ] ) one obtains the mass matrixes @xmath159 and @xmath160 for lepton messenger scalars , and @xmath161 for lepton messenger fermions . the scalar mass matrix in eq.([a3 ] )",
    "is the same as minimal gm , while the scalar mass matrix in eq.([a4 ] ) is diagonal .",
    "so only the fermion mass matrix @xmath162 in eq.([a5 ] ) needs to be diagonalized .",
    "similar to @xcite we assume an unitary matrix @xmath163 to achieve this , with @xmath164 an angle . in principle , we need two independent unitary matrixes for more general @xmath162 other than that in eq.([a5 ] ) .",
