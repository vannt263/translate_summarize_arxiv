    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) have been widely believed to be a thermonuclear explosion of a mass - accreting white dwarf ( wd ) ( e.g. , @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "however , the immediate progenitor binary systems have not been identified yet ( @xcite ) .",
    "there exist two models discussed frequently as progenitors of sne ia : 1 ) the chandrasekhar ( ch ) mass model , in which a mass - accreting carbon - oxygen ( c+o ) wd grows in mass up to the ch mass and explodes as an sn ia , and 2 ) the sub - chandrasekhar ( sub - ch ) mass model , in which an accreted layer of helium atop a c+o wd ignites off - center for a wd mass well below the ch mass .",
    "the early time spectra of the majority of sne ia are in excellent agreement with the synthetic spectra of the ch mass models , while the spectra of the sub - ch mass models are too blue to be comparable with the observations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    for the evolution of accreting wds toward the ch mass ,",
    "two scenarios have been proposed : 1 ) a double degenerate ( dd ) scenario , i.e. , merging of double c+o wds with a combined mass surpassing the ch mass limit ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and 2 ) a single degenerate ( sd ) scenario , i.e. , accretion of hydrogen - rich matter via mass transfer from a binary companion ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . the issue of dd vs. sd",
    "is still debated ( e.g. , @xcite ) , although theoretical modeling has indicated that the merging of wds leads to the accretion - induced collapse rather than sn ia explosion ( saio & nomoto 1985 , 1998 ; @xcite ) .    for the ch / sd scenario , a new evolutionary model has been proposed by hachisu , kato , & nomoto ( 1996 ; hereafter hkn96 ) . hkn96",
    "have shown that if the accretion rate exceeds a critical rate , the wd blows a strong wind and burns hydrogen steadily at this critical rate and expels excess matter in the wind .",
    "the wd increases its mass up to the ch mass avoiding formation of a common envelope .",
    "li & van den heuvel ( 1997 ) have extended hkn96 s model to a system consisting of a mass - accreting wd and a lobe - filling , more massive , main - sequence ( ms ) or sub - giant star ( hereafter `` wd+ms system '' ) , identified with luminous supersoft x - ray sources , and found that such a system is one of the main progenitors of sne ia as well as a system consisting of a wd and a lobe - filling , less massive , red - giant ( hereafter `` wd+rg system '' ) proposed by hkn96 .",
    "recently , yungelson & livio ( 1998 ) have reanalyzed the models by hkn96 and li & van den heuvel based on their population synthesis code and concluded that both hkn96 s wd+rg and li & van den heuvel s wd+ms systems can account for only ( at most ) 10% of the inferred rate of sne ia in our galaxy .",
    "however , yungelson & livio ( 1998 ) overlooked important evolutionary processes both in the wd+ms and wd+rg systems . in this paper",
    ", we first describe an important evolutionary process to form the wd+ms system , which has been overlooked in previous works ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . another evolutionary process leading to the wd+rg system",
    "is discussed elsewhere ( hachisu , kato , & nomoto 1999 , hereafter hkn99 ) . in  2 , we describe the new evolutionary process to form the wd+ms system . including this new evolutionary path",
    ", we will show that the secondary ( slightly evolved ms star ) becomes a helium - rich star like in u sco ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which is transferring helium - rich matter onto the primary ( wd ) .",
    "we have reanalyzed such a helium - rich matter accretion onto the wd based on the optically thick wind theory developed by kato & hachisu ( 1994 ) .",
    "if the secondary ms star has a mass of @xmath2 , a wd with an initial mass of @xmath3 grows in mass to the ch mass and explodes as an sn ia .",
    "we describe the evolution of such a wd+ms system in  3 .",
    "the new parameter region thus obtained is much wider than that by li & van den heuvel ( 1997 ) and yungelson & livio ( 1998 ) .",
    "discussions follow in  4 , in which we have estimated the realization frequency of our wd+ms systems that accounts for about a third of the inferred rate of sne ia in our galaxy .",
    "in this section , we describe the evolutionary path to form the wd+ms system where the secondary ( ms star ) has a helium - rich envelope .",
    "this important evolutionary path shown in figure [ hemtsn1a ] has been overlooked in previous work .",
    "yungelson & livio ( 1998 ) applied their population synthesis code to the wd+ms systems and found that the realization frequency of the wd+ms systems is at most one tenth of the inferred rate of sne ia in our galaxy . in their population synthesis code , they consider only initial systems consisting of a more massive agb star with a c+o core and a less massive main - sequence star .",
    "this system undergoes a common envelope evolution and finally yields a binary system of a mass - accreting c+o wd and a lobe - filling ms or sub - giant star .",
    "their code does not include another important evolutionary path , in which a more massive component fills up its inner critical roche lobe when it develops _ a helium core _ of @xmath0 in _ its red - giant phase_.      this evolutionary path from _ stage a _ to _ f _ in figure [ hemtsn1a ] has been first introduced by hachisu & kato ( 1999 ) to explain the helium - rich companion of the recurrent nova u sco .",
    "we consider , for example , a close binary at a separation @xmath4 with the primary of mass @xmath5 and the secondary of @xmath6 ( _ stage a _ ) .",
    "when the primary has evolved to a red - giant of the radius @xmath7 forming a helium core of mass @xmath8 ( _ stage b _ ) , it fills up its inner critical roche lobe , i.e. , @xmath9 . here , @xmath10 is the effective radius of the inner critical roche lobe of the primary , which is approximated by eggleton s ( 1983 ) formula , @xmath11 for the mass ratio @xmath12 .",
    "the long dashed line in figure [ m7m2com2 ] shows the primary radius @xmath7 against the helium core mass @xmath8 ( @xcite ) . the radius of the primary increases with the helium core mass from @xmath13 to @xmath14 until helium burning ignites at the center of the helium star .",
    "if the primary fills its inner critical roche lobe at a certain @xmath8 , i.e. , @xmath15 , the separation of the binary , @xmath4 , is given by @xmath16 using this relation , we can plot the initial separation @xmath17 against @xmath8 as shown by the thick solid line in figure [ m7m2com2 ]",
    ".    then the mass transfer begins .",
    "this mass transfer is dynamically unstable because the primary red - giant star has a convective envelope .",
    "the binary undergoes common envelope ( ce ) evolution ( _ stage c _ ) , which yields a much more compact close binary consisting of a naked helium star of @xmath18 and a main - sequence star of @xmath19 ( _ stage d _ ) . figure [ m7m2com2 ] shows the separation @xmath20 and the inner critical roche lobe radius of the secondary @xmath21 after the common envelope evolution . here , we assume the relation @xmath22 with the efficiency @xmath23 for the common envelope evolution ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    after the common envelope evolution ,",
    "the radii of the inner critical roche lobes of the primary and the secondary become @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "since the secondary radius ( shown by the dashed line in figure [ m7m2com2 ] for the @xmath26 zams ) should be smaller than its inner critical roche lobe , i.e. , @xmath27 , the initial separation @xmath28 should exceed @xmath29 as shown in figure [ m7m2com2 ] .",
    "the upper bound of the initial separation is obtained from the maximum radius of the @xmath30 star which has formed a helium core , i.e. , @xmath31 .",
    "thus , the allowable range of the initial separations for our model is @xmath32 , so that @xmath33 and @xmath34 for the case of figure [ m7m2com2 ] .      after the hydrogen - rich envelope",
    "is stripped away and hydrogen shell burning vanishes , the naked helium core contracts to ignite central helium burning and becomes a helium main sequence star of mass @xmath8 ( _ stage d _ ) . for @xmath35 ,",
    "its c+o core mass is less than @xmath36 which is the lower mass limit to the non - degenerate carbon ignition ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite for a review )",
    ". then the helium star forms a degenerate c+o core , whose mass @xmath37 grows by helium shell burning .",
    "when @xmath37 becomes @xmath38 and the core becomes strongly degenerate , its helium envelope expands to @xmath39 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) to fill its inner critical roche lobe again ( _ stage e _ ) .",
    "helium is transferred to the secondary stably on an _ evolutionary time scale _ of @xmath40 yr because the mass ratio is smaller than @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "the resultant mass transfer ( mt ) rate is @xmath43 yr@xmath44 , which is too low to form a common envelope ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "after the helium envelope is lost , the primary becomes a c+o wd of @xmath45 ( _ stage f _ ) . in figure",
    "[ m7m2hemt ] , @xmath46 is plotted as a function of @xmath8 . here , we assume the relation of ( in solar mass units of @xmath47 ) @xmath48 for the final degenerate c+o wd mass vs. the initial helium star mass relation ( reduced from the evolutionary paths by @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "helium stars with @xmath49 do not expand to @xmath50 , thus burning most of helium to c+o without transferring helium to the secondary . for @xmath51 ,",
    "the c+o core has a mass larger than @xmath36 before becoming degenerate , thus igniting carbon to form an o+ne+mg core ( e.g. , @xcite ) , thus we do not include their mass range . for @xmath52 , helium is not ignited to form a c+o core .",
    "the secondary increases its mass @xmath53 by receiving almost pure helium matter of @xmath54 , which is a function of @xmath8 as plotted in figure [ m7m2hemt ] .",
    "then a helium - enriched envelope is formed as illustrated in figure [ hemtsn1a ] ( _ stage f _ ) . after the helium mass transfer ( mt ) , the separation increases by 10%@xmath5540% , i.e. , @xmath56 . here , we assume the conservation of the total mass and angular momentum during the helium mass transfer , which leads to the relation of @xmath57 and we use this to obtain @xmath58 and then the orbital period @xmath59 in figure [ m7m2hemt ] .    since the secondary receives @xmath60 helium , its hydrogen content in the envelope decreases to @xmath61 if helium is completely mixed into the central part of the star . however , the envelope of the mass - receiving star is not convective but radiative so that the helium content may be higher in the outer part of the star .",
    "we have examined total @xmath62 cases , @xmath63 , 5 , 6 , 7 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , 1.5 , 2.0 , 2.5 , @xmath66 , and have found the possible progenitors to be in the range of @xmath67 and @xmath68 with the separation of @xmath69 . in these cases , the secondary forms a helium - enriched envelope for the primary mass of @xmath70 ( but not for @xmath71 ) .",
    "we assume , in this paper , that the average mass fractions of hydrogen and helium in the envelope are @xmath72 and @xmath73 respectively .",
    "( assuming the solar abundance of heavy elements @xmath74 ) .",
    "for the @xmath75 case , much more helium is transferred , while much less helium is transferred for the @xmath76 case ( see table [ tbl-1 ] ) .",
    "starting from a close binary of @xmath77 and @xmath78 with the separation of @xmath79 , we have followed a growth of the wd component to examine whether the wd reaches @xmath80 and explodes as an sn ia ( from _ stage f _ to _ j _ in fig .",
    "[ windsn1a ] ) .",
    "the initial secondary now has a helium - rich envelope ( _ stage f _ ) .",
    "it evolves to expand and fills its inner critical roche lobe near the end of main - sequence ( ms ) phase .",
    "then , it starts mass transfer ( _ stage g _ ) .",
    "this is a _ case a mass transfer _",
    "after kippenhahn & weigert ( 1967 , also @xcite ) or a _ cataclysmic - like mass transfer _ after iben & tutukov ( 1984 ) .",
    "since the donor is more massive than the accretor ( wd component ) , the separation decreases and the inner critical roche lobe decreases even to scrape the envelope mass off the donor star .",
    "thus , the mass transfer proceeds on a _ thermal time scale _ rather than an evolutionary time scale ( _ stage h _ ) .",
    "the transferred matter is helium - rich as observed in the recurrent nova u sco .",
    "hachisu , kato , & nomoto ( 1996 , hkn96 ) have shown that optically thick winds blow from the white dwarf when the mass accretion rate exceeds a critical value ( _ stage h _ ) . in the present case ,",
    "the accreted matter to form the white dwarf envelope is helium - rich , which is different from the solar abundance in hkn96 .",
    "assuming @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 , we have calculated the envelope models of accreting white dwarfs for various accretion rates and white dwarf masses , i.e. , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 .",
    "optically thick winds occur for all these ten cases of @xmath91 as shown for five cases of @xmath92 , @xmath85 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath90 in figures [ dmdtenvx50z02 ] and [ dmdttrvx50z02 ] .",
    "our numerical methods have been described in kato & hachisu ( 1994 ) .",
    "the envelope solution is uniquely determined if the envelope mass @xmath93 is given , where @xmath93 is the mass above the base of the hydrogen - burning shell .",
    "therefore , the wind mass loss rate @xmath94 and the nuclear burning rate @xmath95 are obtained as a function of the envelope mass @xmath93 , i.e. , @xmath96 and @xmath97 as shown in figure [ dmdtenvx50z02 ] .",
    "the envelope mass of the white dwarf is determined by @xmath98 if the mass transfer rate does not change much in a thermal time scale of the wd envelope , the steady - state @xmath99 , i.e. , @xmath100 is a good approximation .",
    "in such a steady - state approximation , the ordinates in figures [ dmdtenvx50z02 ] and [ dmdttrvx50z02 ] , @xmath101 , are regarded as the mass transfer rate from the secondary @xmath102 .",
    "thus , the envelope solution is determined from the relation in figure [ dmdtenvx50z02 ] for the given mass transfer rate @xmath102 .",
    "the photospheric radius , temperature , and velocity are also obtained from the relations in figure [ dmdttrvx50z02 ] .",
    "optically thick winds blow when the mass transfer rate exceeds the critical rate , which corresponds to the break of each solid line in figure [ dmdtenvx50z02 ] .",
    "there exists only a static ( no wind ) envelope solution for the mass transfer rate below this break .",
    "its critical accretion rate is approximated as @xmath103 for @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 . if the mass accretion rate exceeds the critical rate , i.e. , @xmath107 , the strong wind blows from the white dwarf . the white dwarf accretes helium almost at the critical rate , i.e. , @xmath108 , and expels the excess matter in the wind at a rate of @xmath109",
    "here , we assume that the white dwarf accretes helium - rich matter from the equator via the accretion disk and blows winds to the pole or off the equator .      steady hydrogen shell burning converts hydrogen into helium atop the c+o core , which can be regarded as a helium matter accretion onto the c+o wd . to estimate whether or not the white dwarf mass grows to @xmath80",
    ", we must calculate the mass accumulation efficiency , that is , the ratio between the mass accumulated in the wd after h / he - burning and the mass transferred from the companion .",
    "we denote the efficiency by @xmath110 and @xmath111 for hydrogen shell - burning and helium shell - burning , respectively .",
    "as shown in the previous subsection , the excess matter is blown in the wind when the mass transfer rate exceeds the critical rate , which leads to @xmath112 , for the wind phase .    during the evolution of mass - accreting white dwarfs ,",
    "the accretion rate becomes lower than @xmath113 in some cases .",
    "then the wind stops ( _ stage i _ in fig . [ windsn1a ] ) .",
    "hydrogen steadily burns for @xmath114 .",
    "then , we have @xmath115 . for @xmath116 ,",
    "hydrogen shell - burning becomes unstable to trigger weak shell flashes .",
    "once a weak hydrogen shell flash occurs , a part of the envelope mass of the white dwarf may be lost from the system ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the present study ,",
    "no mass loss is assumed during the weak hydrogen shell flashes until the mass transfer rate becomes lower than @xmath117 , i.e. , @xmath115 for @xmath118 .",
    "when the mass transfer rate becomes lower than @xmath119 , however , no mass accumulation is expected from such relatively strong hydrogen shell - flashes ( e.g. , @xcite ) , i.e. , @xmath120 for @xmath121 .",
    "therefore , we stop calculating the binary evolution either when the primary reaches @xmath80 ( _ stage j _ in fig . [ windsn1a ] ) , i.e. , @xmath122 or the mass transfer rate becomes lower than @xmath119 .    to summarize , we have used the following simplified relation @xmath123 for the mass accumulation efficiency of hydrogen shell burning .      for @xmath124 , steady hydrogen burning",
    "is equivalent to the helium accretion at the critical rate of @xmath113 given by equation ( [ critical ] ) . in this case ,",
    "weak helium shell flashes are triggered ( e.g. , @xcite ) and almost all processed matter is accumulated on the c+o wd .",
    "recently , kato & hachisu ( 1999 ) have recalculated the helium wind model after the helium shell flashes and estimated the mass accumulation efficiency with the updated opal opacity ( @xcite ) . here",
    ", we adopt their new results in a simple analytic form , i.e. , @xmath125 where the helium mass accretion rate , @xmath126 , is in units of @xmath47 yr@xmath44 .",

    "it should be noted that either a roche lobe overflow or a common envelope does not play a role as a mass ejection mechanism because the envelope matter goes away quickly from the system without interacting with the orbital motion ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "we have followed binary evolutions from the initial state of @xmath130 or @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is the initial orbital period . here",
    ", the subscript naught ( 0 ) denotes _ stage f _ in figure [ windsn1a ] , that is , before the mass transfer from the secondary starts .",
    "the radius and luminosity of slightly evolved main - sequence stars are calculated from the analytic form given by tout et al .",
    "the mass transfer proceeds on a thermal time scale for the mass ratio of @xmath133 .",
    "we approximate the mass transfer rate as @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the kelvin - helmholtz timescale ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and @xmath136 and @xmath137 are the mass - radius exponents of the inner critical roche lobe and the main sequence component , respectively ( e.g. , @xcite ) . the effective radius of the inner critical roche lobe , @xmath138 , is calculated from equation ( [ inner_critical_roche_lobe ] ) .",

    "the mass transfer begins at a rate as high as @xmath153",
    ". the wd burns hydrogen to form a helium layer at the critical rate of @xmath154 and the wind mass loss rate is @xmath155 .",
    "thus a large part of the transferred matter is blown off in the wind .",
    "since the mass ratio @xmath156 decreases , the mass transfer rate determined by equation([secondary_mass_transfer ] ) gradually decreases below @xmath113 .",
    "the wind stops at @xmath157 . the mass transfer rate becomes lower than @xmath158 yr@xmath44 ( for @xmath159 ) at @xmath160 and very weak shell flashes may occur .",

    "we thus obtain the realization frequency of sne ia from the wd+ms systems as @xmath218 yr@xmath44 for @xmath219 , by substituting @xmath220 , @xmath221 , @xmath222 , and @xmath217 into equation ( [ realization_frequence ] ) . for comparison",
    ", we have obtained a realization frequency of sne ia for @xmath223 .",
    "it is still as high as @xmath224 yr@xmath44 , which is about one fourth of the inferred rate .",
    "our new rate of @xmath218 yr@xmath44 is about a third of the inferred rate of sne ia in our galaxy and much higher than @xmath225 yr@xmath44 ( as an upper limit ) obtained by yungelson & livio ( 1998 ) .",
    "the reason of their low frequency is probably due to the absence of the path through the primary s helium star phase in their scenarios .",
    "however , it should be noted here that yungelson & livio ( 1998 ) have also obtained a realization frequency of @xmath226 yr@xmath44 under the assumption of no restrictions in their binary evolutions , the conditions of which are unlikely .",
    "a part of our wd+ms systems are identified as the luminous supersoft x - ray sources ( ssss ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "ssss are characterized by a luminosity of @xmath227 erg s@xmath44 and a temperature of @xmath228 k @xmath229 ev ) , which have been established as a new class of x - ray sources through rosat observations ( e.g. , @xcite for a recent review ) . a population synthesis for ssss",
    "has first been done by rappaport , di stefano , & smith ( 1994 ) , followed by a more complete population synthesis ( @xcite ) .",
    "these calculations predict the total number of the galactic ssss of @xmath128 and led to the conclusion that the sss birth rate is roughly consistent with the observation ( e.g. , @xcite for a review ) .",
    "our sn ia progenitors should be observed as an sss during the steady hydrogen shell burning phase without winds , which is about a few times @xmath230 yr as shown in figure [ evlx50z02 ] .",
    "then the number of ssss from our scenario is roughly estimated to be at least about @xmath231 , which should be added to 1000 by yungelson et al .",
    "the total number is still consistent with observations .",
    "our wd+ms progenitor model predicts helium - enriched matter accretion onto a wd .",
    "strong he ii @xmath232 lines are prominent in the luminous supersoft x - ray sources ( e.g. , @xcite for a recent review ) as well as in the recurrent novae like u sco ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and v394 cra ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus the weakness of the hydrogen emission lines relative to the he ii and cno lines is very consistent with the requirement that the accreted matter and hence the envelope of the secondary have a hydrogen - poor ( helium - rich ) composition .    for sne ia",
    ", several attempts have been made to detect signature of circumstellar matter .",
    "there has been no radio detections so far .",
    "radio observations of sn 1986 g have provided the most stringent upper limit to the circumstellar density as @xmath233 yr@xmath44 ( @xcite ) , where @xmath234 means @xmath235 km s@xmath44 .",
    "this is still @xmath236 times higher than the density predicted for the white dwarf winds , because the wd wind velocity is as fast as @xmath128 km s@xmath44 .",
