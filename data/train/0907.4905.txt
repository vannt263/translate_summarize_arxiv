    "understanding the phase structure of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is one of the key issues in current high - energy physics .",
    "thorough phenomenological knowledge of properties of the hadron spectrum as well as nuclear matter is now being complemented by increasingly precise first - principle numerical studies of qcd at nonzero temperature .",
    "however , the application of lattice techniques to matter at high baryon chemical potential @xmath1 remains a major challenge due to the infamous sign problem  @xcite .",
    "the difficulties encountered in simulations of qcd triggered interest in similar theories which are free of the sign problem .",
    "these include simulations at imaginary chemical potential  @xcite , qcd at nonzero isospin density  @xcite , a qcd - like theory with adjoint quarks  @xcite , and two - color qcd  @xcite .",
    "the latter , two - color qcd , will be the subject of the present article .",
    "two - color qcd differs in several aspects from the world we live in .",
    "the most notable difference perhaps is that the colorless baryons are formed from two quarks , and hence are bosons .",
    "dense matter is then not realized as an interacting fermi sea of nucleons , but rather as a bose gas of diquarks which undergoes bose ",
    "einstein condensation ( bec ) at sufficiently low temperature .",
    "therefore the ground state of cold and dense two - color quark matter forms a superfluid  @xcite .",
    "another noteworthy feature of two - color qcd , stemming from the fact that the @xmath2 gauge group has only pseudo - real representations , is the pauli  grsey symmetry  @xcite connecting quarks with antiquarks . as a consequence , the spectrum of nambu ",
    "goldstone ( ng ) bosons of the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry contains diquark states in addition to the pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "the presence of light particles carrying baryon number ( i.e.  baryonic pions ) is quite peculiar to two - color qcd ( and qcd with adjoint quarks ) and crucial for understanding the phase structure at @xmath3 and @xmath4 by means of the chiral lagrangian approach  @xcite .",
    "the model - independent chiral lagrangian arguments have been complemented by investigations in various models such as the linear sigma model  @xcite , the random matrix theory  @xcite , the strong - coupling expansion  @xcite .",
    "the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model was first applied to two - color qcd in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in fact there has been a tight communication between a number of effective model studies and the monte - carlo simulations on the lattice .",
    "recent progress in this direction led to first attempts to probe bec of diquarks and the region of moderate baryon density  @xcite .",
    "thus , based on the knowledge achieved in these preceding papers , the present paper aims to make a proposal to use the two - color qcd model as a controllable test setting to clarify the following controversial issues on the real - qcd phase diagram .",
    " * in - medium @xmath0 symmetry restoration *  + the qcd lagrangian has global @xmath0 symmetry at the classical level .",
    "the quantum anomaly , however , leads to a nonconserving contribution to the axial current , which breaks @xmath0 symmetry explicitly . from the point of view of quantum field theory",
    "the anomaly comes from highly ultraviolet modes , and thus , the anomaly should be insensitive to any infrared scales such as @xmath5 , @xmath1 , and the quark mass @xmath6 . in this sense",
    "the @xmath0 anomaly is never restored at any @xmath5 nor @xmath1 . in the effective model description",
    "the @xmath0 anomaly manifests itself in the form of a @xmath0-breaking interaction which is microscopically induced by instantons  @xcite .",
    "because instantons are suppressed at high @xmath5 or @xmath1  @xcite , the @xmath0-breaking interaction is anticipated to weaken in a medium , leading to `` effective restoration '' of the @xmath0 symmetry  @xcite .",
    "in fact , a quantitative estimate of the reduction of the @xmath0 effect is crucial for locating the qcd critical point in the @xmath7 phase diagram  @xcite .",
    "the numerical study by the lattice monte - carlo simulation is in principle possible in two - color qcd .",
    "the clear signal for @xmath0 restoration is degeneracy in the spectra of mesons connected by a @xmath0 rotation  @xcite .",
    "that is , in the two - flavor case , the @xmath0 partners are @xmath8 the masses of these multiplets become degenerate when the chiral symmetry is also restored .",
    "since the @xmath9 meson involves the so - called disconnected diagrams , the lattice simulation is too noisy to see the degeneracy with @xmath10 ( flavor - singlet @xmath11 ) which is also in a noisy channel .",
    "it is , however , feasible to check the degeneracy between @xmath12 and @xmath13 in the finite-@xmath5 and finite-@xmath1 lattice simulation of two - color qcd .  in this paper",
    "we will give a quantitative guide from an effective model study .     * superfluidity and quarkyonic matter *  + a new state of matter at high density has been recognized and it is now referred to as _ quarkyonic matter _  @xcite . because the definition of quarkyonic matter is clear only in the large @xmath14 limit , in which color non - singlet interactions are subleading , there seem to be some confusing arguments like that quarkyonic matter overwhelms color superconductivity .",
    "this is not quite true especially when @xmath14 is finite .",
    "intuitively , quarkyonic matter is characterized by the properties that the thermodynamic quantities ( pressure , baryon density , etc . )",
    "should be almost saturated by the degenerated fermi liquid of quarks and the collective excitations on top of the fermi surface should be colorless ( i.e.  color confined ) .",
    "this is actually one of the known properties fulfilled by a certain color - superconducting phase , that is , the color - flavor locked ( cfl ) phase  @xcite . to form a colorless object in the cfl phase , however , we need to treat a meson composed of four quarks , which is technically complicated . instead of real qcd , here ,",
    "we shall make use of the two - color system ; this exhibits superfluidity at high density which is reminiscent of color superconductivity in qcd , and besides , we need not treat four quarks , since diquarks ( that is , baryons in the two - color world ) can make a color singlet",
    ". we will demonstrate that the realization of quarkyonic matter is not so exclusive to disfavor superfluidity and diquark condensation .",
    "the goal of our discussions in this part is to make convincing the phase diagram as drawn in fig .",

    "let us now specify the model that we will use .",
    "physics of cooper pairing of quarks ( dense fermionic matter in general ) is well described by njl - type effective models .",
    "however , the njl - type models suffer from a serious drawback : the lack of confinement , which may bring about artificial model predictions . in order to capture the essential features of confinement physics and",
    "yet maintain the technical simplicity of the njl model , it was augmented with the polyakov loop , equipped with a phenomenological potential designed to reproduce selected lattice data at finite @xmath5 and zero @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "( see also , ref .",
    "@xcite for example , for a related approach of the polyakov loop extended quark - meson model . ) this extended model is now called the pnjl model . in spite of its simplicity",
    ", the pnjl model has shown remarkable agreement with thermodynamic quantities measured in the lattice qcd simulations .",
    "so far , among available finite-@xmath5 and finite-@xmath1 model options at least , the pnjl model is one of the best tools to unveil the qcd phase structure . in this paper , in a sense , we _ downgrade _ the pnjl model into the two - color setting , hoping that our model predictions would guide the future two - color simulations .",
    "figure  [ fig : phase ] is actually the phase diagram of two - color two - flavor qcd predicted by means of the pnjl model .",
    "we note that the phase diagram is divided into three regimes : one at high @xmath5 consists of deconfined and chiral symmetric particles , which is to be identified as a quark - gluon plasma .",
    "the other one at low @xmath5 and low @xmath1 is of course the hadronic phase .",
    "the last one at low @xmath5 and high @xmath1 is commonly referred to as a superfluid state .",
    "we will later discuss that this state can be regarded as quarkyonic matter ",
    "so to speak , quarkyonic superfluid of two - color quark matter . keeping in mind this phase structure",
    ", we will look at the pole and screening masses of mesons to extract the information on @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "the meson spectrum in the pnjl model was first analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite . along the same line",
    ", we will perform the calculations and examine the dependence of meson spectrum on the @xmath0-breaking interaction strength .",

    "two - color qcd with @xmath15 massless quark flavors has a global @xmath16 flavor invariance at the classical level owing to the pauli  grsey symmetry  @xcite .",
    "the axial anomaly explicitly breaks @xmath16 to @xmath17 . in the vacuum ,",

    "the interaction @xmath27 is minimal in the sense that it only involves the scalar and pseudoscalar channels with isospin zero and unity . while the above @xmath28 is invariant under a @xmath0 rotation , we further need an interaction which breaks the @xmath0 symmetry . to that end",

    "stratonovich transformation in all six channels , we arrive at the total lagrangian as @xmath38 the covariant derivative @xmath39 involves coupling of the quarks to the background gauge field @xmath40 which translates to the polyakov loop in the end .",
    "in addition , we note that @xmath6 and @xmath41 denote the current quark mass and the quark chemical potential .",
    "later we will introduce @xmath1 to denote the baryon chemical potential ; @xmath42 where 2 comes from the number of colors .",
    "the collective fields @xmath43 represent in order the mesons in the scalar - isoscalar , pseudoscalar - isovector , pseudoscalar - isoscalar , and scalar - isovector channels , and the scalar and pseudoscalar diquarks .",
    "( we hereafter omit the subscript `` 0 '' out of @xmath10 and @xmath12 for simplicity . )    in the absence of isospin chemical potential the isovector modes do not develop a vacuum expectation value . moreover , the vafa  witten theorem  @xcite guarantees that the chiral condensate in the vacuum has positive parity . in our model approach , this requires @xmath44 , that is , @xmath45 .",

    "note that , as usual in the pnjl model literature , we simulate the effects of gauge dynamics by a constant background temporal gauge field .",
    "we then adopt a phenomenological ansatz for the gauge contribution to the mean - field thermodynamic potential , chosen to reproduce selected features of the pure gauge theory .",
    "therefore , the parameters @xmath66 only enter the thermodynamic potential since there are no dynamical gauge degrees of freedom in our model lagrangian .",
    "it is interesting to recall that in the three - color case the thermodynamic potential in general can not be written in terms of the polyakov loop variable @xmath67 ( and the conjugate @xmath68 ) only , and one has to use two phases analogous to our @xmath50 to parameterize it . on the contrary , in the two - color pnjl model",
    "the thermodynamic potential depends just on @xmath67 even in the presence of a diquark condensate .",

    "we argued that one can fit the parameters of the njl part of the model using physical ( three - color ) observables , but their values have to be rescaled appropriately . once this is done and the quark sector is coupled to the polyakov loop , the model yields locking behavior of chiral and deconfinement crossovers as long as @xmath1 is zero .",
    "we checked older results on the phase structure of the two - color njl model in the plane of @xmath148 and @xmath149 , and analyzed its modification induced by the coupling to the polyakov loop .",

    "we carefully clarified the realization of quarkyonic matter in the two - color system .",
    "the baryon number density @xmath141 appears finite as soon as @xmath1 exceeds the mass of the baryonic pion , but still the quark contribution to @xmath141 is not substantial until @xmath1 surpasses the twice of the dynamical quark mass .",
    "after then quark degrees of freedom supersede baryons , meaning a transition from `` superfluid nuclear matter '' into `` quarkyonic superfluid . ''",
    "our model analysis of the phase diagram is based on two simplifying assumptions .",
    "the first one is the mean - field approximation which treats the system as a gas of noninteracting fermionic quasiparticles .",
    "this may not be quantitatively accurate in some regions of the phase diagram such as for @xmath186 at nonzero temperature where the system behaves rather as a dilute bose gas .",
    "on the other hand , in the theory of strongly - interacting fermi gases the mean - field approximation is known to be reliable at zero temperature . moreover , the structure of the phase diagram concerning diquark condensation and chiral symmetry restoration is robust , being a direct consequence of the symmetry of two - color qcd .",
    "the second assumption is the extrapolation of the gauge part of the thermodynamic potential to nonzero baryon chemical potential .",
    "this has been justified for three - color qcd and low baryon chemical potential by a comparison with available lattice data and , in fact , is the source of the predictive power of the pnjl model .",
    "therefore , we are confident about the existence of the quarkyonic superfluid phase as depicted in fig .  [",
    "fig : phase ] . on the other hand",
    ", the most recent lattice data @xcite suggest that the polyakov loop at a fixed low value of temperature starts to rise at @xmath187 , signalling possible deconfinement .",
    "this certainly presents a challenge to the pnjl model and determines the direction of our future research efforts .    finally , we studied the dependence of the spectrum of collective excitations ( scalar and pseudoscalar mesons and diquarks ) on the strength of the axial anomaly . for that sake",
    "we introduced a njl - type interaction with a tunable @xmath0-breaking parameter .",

    "become degenerate , as expected . at the same time , our results indicate that the restoration of @xmath0 symmetry in terms of the masses of parity partners can not be hidden by chiral restoration unlike the full topological susceptibility , which is good .",
    "this would naturally incorporate in the model study the suppression of instanton effects in a hot and/or dense matter . to make this whole argument into a quantitative predictive framework ,",
