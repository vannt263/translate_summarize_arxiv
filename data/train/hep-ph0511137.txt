    "provided low - energy supersymmetry ( susy )  @xcite is realized in nature , the next generation of colliders , the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite and the international linear collider ( ilc )  @xcite are likely to produce most particles of the susy spectrum and will allow for precise measurements of their properties . if susy is established experimentally , it is the main task to explore the unknown mechanism of susy breaking .",
    "specific susy breaking models ( e.  g.  minimal supergravity ( msugra )  @xcite ) can be tested against the observables in a straight - forward manner due to the small number of parameters . however , an exploration of the parameters of the general minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) parameter space is significantly more ambitious , especially without the use of any _ a priori _ assumptions on the parameter values . using the best - studied mssm scenario available to date , sps1a  @xcite ,",
    "the prospects for susy parameter measurements using the fit program fittino  @xcite are outlined in the following .",
    "fittino has been created to determine the parameters of the mssm lagrangian without any _ a priori _ assumptions , using available loop - level precision predictions ( e.  g.  @xcite ) and observables from present and future colliders , cosmology and rare decay measurements in a @xmath0 fit . since finding",
    "the @xmath0-minimum in a many - dimensional ( @xmath1 ) parameter space is difficult , a 3-step technique is used : first , the parameters are estimated using tree - level relations .",
    "second , simulated annealing is used to find the global minimum .",
    "third , a global fit is used to find the precise minimum and determine the parameter uncertainties and correlations .",
    "in order to test the parameter measurement using simulated measurements from future colliders , the sps1a scenario  @xcite is chosen .",
    "unification is assumed in the first two generations , and the top quark mass @xmath2 is fitted as an additional parameter to account for parametric uncertainties . in total , 19 free parameters are fitted . the observables and their simulated uncertainties used in the fit",
    "are given in  @xcite . by fitting to edges in lhc spectra instead of masses derived from the spectra  @xcite , correlations among observables",
    "are taken into account where known to date .",
    "using simulated measurements from lhc only , most relative uncertainties on the parameters are in the order of 100% . therefore , the data from the ilc is needed to understand the low - energy mssm lagrangian .",
    "the fit including the simulated ilc measurements is stable , very well under control ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : pulldist ] ) and shows no biases  @xcite .",

    "the precision for most of the parameters lies in the per - cent or sub - percent range .",

    "a result of such a fit is shown in tab .",
    "[ tab : msugrafitresults ]  @xcite .",
    "however , also in such a case the precision obtained with the combined lhc and ilc data is more precise by more than an order of magnitude , and hence the sensitivity on deviations from a pure high - scale scenario is strongly enhanced by the ilc , underlining its ability to be a telescope to gut scale physics .",
    "using fittino , the lagrangian parameters of the mssm , assuming real parameters but without assumptions on the susy breaking mechanism , can be correctly reconstructed without usage of _ a priori _ information .",
    "this has been achieved using simulated precision measurements at the lhc and ilc as input to a global fit exploiting the techniques implemented in the program fittino .",
    "most of the lagrangian parameters can be determined to a precision around the percent level .",
    "for some parameters an accuracy of better than 1  per mil is achievable if theoretical uncertainties are neglected . assuming present theoretical uncertainties for the predictions , the precision of the lagrangian parameter measurement is significantly deteriorated . while the experimental information from the lhc alone without the additional information from the ilc is not sufficient to determine the full low - energy mssm lagrangian parameters , it is enough to determine the parameters of a high - scale msugra scenario .",
    "however , the precision of the parameter determination ( and hence the sensitivity on deviations from perfect unification ) increases by more than an order of magnitude if ilc data are added .",
