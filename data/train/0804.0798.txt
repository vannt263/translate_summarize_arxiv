    "in the hierarchical model of galaxy formation , low mass dwarf - sized galaxies collapse and merge to form the massive galactic structures that we observe today .",

    ", three satellites are undergoing tidal disruption and accretion : the magellanic stream @xcite , sagittarius dwarf @xcite , and canis major dwarf @xcite . the andromeda spiral galaxy ( m31 ) , our nearest large neighbor , also hosts a number of tidally distorted and disrupted satellites .",
    "these include the dwarf elliptical galaxy ngc  205 @xcite , the compact elliptical galaxy m32 @xcite , the giant southern stream @xcite , and possibly the satellite galaxy andromeda viii @xcite . in this paper",

    "in addition to being building blocks of larger galaxies , dwarf galaxies are interesting in their own right . of the various dwarf galaxy types , dwarf elliptical ( de ) galaxies are the least understood , and their origin is heavily debated .",
    "what is known about des is that they are a galaxy population found exclusively in denser regions , accounting for more than 75% of the objects in cluster environments @xcite .",
    "they are typically dark matter poor in their inner regions and predominantly gas poor . the two general de",
    "formation theories postulate that these galaxies are primordial building blocks or an evolved / transformed population , but neither theory is capable of explaning all the observables .",
    "the first theory , based on cold dark matter models , asserts that these are low mass , primordial building blocks that formed early ( @xmath5 ) in their present locale .",
    "if des formed by this scenario , we could gain insight into the very first galaxies to form by studying these relics .",
    "the second theory postulates that des are born as more massive spiral galaxies which are subsequently altered as a result of interactions with other galaxies through tidal effects @xcite .",
    "if des are transformed spirals then this transformation is expected to cause an increase in the velocity dispersion and induce some rotation @xcite . however , this scenario is unable to explain the observed distribution of rotation speeds and velocity dispersions among virgo cluster des .",
    "specifically , it can not explain the presence of a substantial population of des with no detectable rotation and relatively low velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "to complicate matters further , the faint underlying disks are found in both rotating and non - rotating des @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that the des result from some combination of the above two mechanisms . a complete model explaining de formation is still needed .",
    "local group de galaxies offer an excellent resource for the exploration of these and other formation scenarios .",
    "unlike the milky way which does not host any de satellites , m31 hosts a total of three : ngc  185 , ngc  147 , and ngc  205 .",
    "ngc  185 and ngc  147 lie far enough away from m31 to escape present tidal distortion .",

    "@xcite postulates that the @xmath17 ( 15 kpc ) long , arc - like feature seen in the northwest quadrant of m31 could be a stellar stream associated with ngc  205 .",
    "@xcite report possible evidence of tidal debris to the west of ngc  205 beyond its tidal radius in their study of c stars in the system . within an effective radius ,",
    "ngc  205 appears to be undistorted .",
    "however , beyond this radius , there is strong evidence for distortion .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the large parameter space defining the orbit and history of ngc  205 using a restricted @xmath0-body code and a genetic algorithm for optimization .",
    "modeling satellite / parent galaxy interactions is extremely difficult when there are no gaseous or stellar streams to directly constrain the path of the satellite s orbit . in the absence of tidal trails ,",
    "as is the case for ngc 205 , there is a limited set of observable quantities that can be used as constraints : stellar radial velocities , projected sky position , and constraints on the line - of - sight distance . to complicate matters further , large parameter spaces with inherent degeneracies",
    "typically define galaxy encounters .",
    "hence , in weakly distorted systems , it is difficult to find unique , qualified fits to the observables .",
    "for this reason , few optimized @xmath0-body studies of mildly distorted galaxies have been carried out . in our simulations",
    "we employ a genetic algorithm to achieve optimization @xcite . this particular optimization technique has been successfully used in similar studies of more heavily distorted dwarf galaxies @xcite . using a restricted @xmath0-body code ,",
    "we explore three distinct , initially stable configurations of 1000 test particles representing ngc  205 : a ( cold ) rotating disk without velocity dispersion , a ( warm ) rotating disk with velocity dispersion , and a ( hot ) spheroid supported completely by randomly distributed , isotropic velocities .",
    "detailed photometric and kinematic observations enable this unique study by providing strong constraints on the simulated system @xcite .",
    "the paper is laid out as follows : in  [ sec_observ ] we discuss the photometric and kinematic observational data used to constrain our system . in  [ sec_numerical ]",

    "finally , in  [ sec_future ] we discuss the observational and computational improvements that could be applied to this study .",
    "our study of ngc  205 is unique because we enforce both photometric and kinematic constraints on our simulated system .",
    "although this can not ensure that we converge on the correct orbital history of ngc  205 , it does remove a significant amount of the degeneracy inherent in studies that only use photometric constraints .",
    "strong evidence of tidal distortion is seen both in the photometry and the kinematics of ngc  205 at a major - axis distance of @xmath18 ( @xmath19 kpc ) @xcite .",
    "a discussion of the surface photometry by @xcite is included in  [ ssec_photo ] , and a discussion of the internal kinematics by @xcite is included in  [ ssec_kinematic ] .",

    "the surface photometry of ngc  205 in the _ b_- and",
    "_ i_-bands was obtained by @xcite using the kitt peak national observatory 0.9/0.6 meter burrell schmidt telescope . due to the incompleteness of the _ i_-band coverage",
    ", @xcite employed the _ b_-band data and iraf s ellipse task to determine the surface brightness contours of ngc  205 out to a limiting magnitude of @xmath20 mag arcsec@xmath21 , coinciding with a semi - major axis distance of 720(2.88 kpc ) .",
    "@xcite reports that ngc  205 is well fit by two different exponential profiles at various semi - major axis radii .",
    "one profile , covering a semi - major axis range of @xmath22 ( @xmath23 kpc ) , has a disk scale length of @xmath24 ( 0.60 kpc ) , where @xmath25 is defined as the radius at which the intensity has decreased by a factor of @xmath26 ; the other profile , covering a semi - major axis range of @xmath27 ( @xmath28 kpc ) and @xmath29 ( 2.00 kpc ) , has a disk scale length of @xmath30 ( 0.68 kpc ) .",
    "also reported was a  subtle downward break \" at @xmath31 ( 1.20 kpc ) , which correlates nicely with the semi - major axis distance of @xmath32 ( 1.04 kpc ) that marks the location where the isophotal position angle and ellipticity stop increasing and begin decreasing , leading to a _",
    "s_-shaped semi - major axis profile for ngc  205 .",
    "the location of this isophotal twisting matches the radial velocity turnover radius of @xmath33 ( @xmath34 or 1.08 kpc ) observed by @xcite , thus supporting the conclusion that ngc  205 is interacting tidally with m31 .",
    "we perform our own exponential fit of the form : @xmath35 to the intermediate parts of @xcite intensity profile in order to estimate the disk scale length of the galaxy if it were tidally undistorted .",
    "we exclude the nucleus ( interior to 100 , or 0.40 kpc ) where the data follows neither an exponential law ( exp[@xmath36 ) nor a de vaucouleurs law ( exp[@xmath37 ) , and the outer regions ( exterior to 672 , or 2.68 kpc ) where the surface brightness and sky become comparable . we measure a disk scale length of @xmath38 ( 0.59 kpc ) and a central ( nucleus - free ) surface brightness of @xmath39 magnitudes per square arcsecond .",
    "these results are used as a basis for generating an undistorted ngc  205 and modeling the inner and outer regions of ngc  205 in its final , integrated state .",
    "hence , we are able to remove the nucleus from ngc  205 by extrapolating the exponential surface brightness profile from the intermediate region ( @xmath40 ) to the central region ( @xmath41 ) . the surface brightness profile of @xcite , our exponential surface brightness fit , and the data used in our simulations are summarized in figure [ fig : intensity ] .",
    "a recent kinematic study of ngc  205 by @xcite using the keck / deimos multislit spectrograph resulted in the collection of radial velocities for 725 rgb stars .",
    "the stellar spectra were obtained using 4 masks , each covering an area of @xmath42 ( @xmath43 kpc ) .",
    "two of these masks were centered on ngc  205 along the major axis , while the other two were placed off center along the tidally distorted major axis , one in south - east ( se ) and one in north - west ( nw ) .",
    "these observations extend out to @xmath44 ( 4.79 kpc ) , well beyond the tidal radius of ngc  205 , and are spatially well distributed .",
    "the contamination by m31 field stars is estimated to be only a few percent .",
    "the systemic velocity of ngc  205 , as measured by @xcite , is @xmath45 km  s@xmath3 , while the systemic velocity of m31 is @xmath46 km  s@xmath3   @xcite .",
    "this results in a velocity for ngc  205 of @xmath47 km  s@xmath3   relative to m31 .",
    "the velocities of the nw tail of the satellite are more positive , while the se tail , which is closer to m31 , are more negative as compared to ngc  205 s systemic velocity .",
    "the opposite is true in the central regions ( @xmath48 ) .    @xcite maps the semi - major axis velocity profile of ngc  205 by binning the rgb stars perpendicular to the _ s_-shaped major axis into @xmath49 ( 0.24 kpc ) radial bins .",
    "the velocity of each bin , containing a minimum of 25 stars , is determined by fitting a gaussian profile to its stars .",
    "the resulting fit is plotted in figure [ fig : velocity ] .",
    "the major - axis rotation curve of ngc  205 shows a distinct velocity turnover ( with @xmath50 km  s@xmath3 ) at @xmath33 , which is coincident with the estimated tidal radius ( @xmath51 ) and onset of isophotal twisting ( see  [ ssec_photo ] ) .",
    "@xcite suggests that this feature is due to gravitational interaction between ngc  205 and m31 , and infers that ngc  205 is on a prograde encounter .",
    "if correct , over half of @xcite evenly sampled rgb stars lie outside ngc  205 s tidal radius , meaning they have been tidally stripped from the satellite and are no longer bound .",
    "the ratio of the maximum rotational velocity to the average velocity dispersion of ngc  205 ( assuming an average ellipticity of @xmath52 ) is @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "given that the expected ratio for an isotropic , oblate , rotational - flattened galaxy with @xmath52 is @xmath54 and that similar anisotropic virgo de s on average have @xmath55 , ngc  205 falls somewhere between a rotational supported body and an anisotropic object @xcite .",
    "we perform a linear fit to the the interior regions ( @xmath56 ) of ngc  205 where significant tidal distortion has not yet occurred . using @xcite error bars for each velocity measurement ,",
    "we determine a maximum and minimum slope for the satellite s central velocity profile of 0.0 km  s@xmath3  arcsec@xmath3 and @xmath570.08 km  s@xmath3  arcsec@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "this significance level corresponds to @xmath58 and is plotted in figure [ fig : velocity ] .",
    "we use both this subset and the full dataset to constrain the motion of test particles in our numerical simulations ( see  [ sssec_slope ] and  [ sssec_wtvelo ] ) .",
    "the previous section discusses the photometric and kinematic observations of ngc  205 . in order to reproduce the observed features of ngc  205",
    ", we trace ngc  205 s center of mass back half an orbit , set up an initial configuration of test particles ( to represent the undistorted ngc  205 ) , and allow it to interact under the influence of both ngc  205 s and m31 s potential . the final , integrated galaxy",
    "is then compared to photometric and kinematic observations .",
    "strict upper and lower limits are placed on the variable parameters and a genetic algorithm is employed to effectively search our parameter space . in the following sections we discuss the explorable parameters of the system (  [ ssec_initial ] ) , the potentials of both galaxies (  [ ssec_potential ] ) , the initial configurations of ngc  205 s test particles (  [ ssec_particles ] ) , the integration scheme (  [ ssec_nbody ] ) , the genetic algorithm used to improve on the initial guesses (  [ ssec_ga ] ) , and , finally , our method of comparing the integrated system to observations (  [ ssec_fitness ] ) .",
    "the goal of these simulations is to determine the orbital parameters of ngc  205 .    for our simulations ,",
    "the units are chosen such that the distance unit is @xmath59 ( or 10 kpc if we assume ngc  205 lies at a distance of 824 kpc ) , the velocity unit is 280 km  s@xmath3 , and @xmath60 .",
    "this roughly results in a mass unit of 1.8 @xmath61 and a time unit of 35 myr .",
    "there are a total of 10 free parameters in our numerical simulation .",
    "six of these parameters define the initial conditions of the undistorted ngc  205 system , while the other four define the final conditions of the present day observed system .",
    "the six initial condition parameters are the mass of ngc  205 ( @xmath62 ) , the disk scale length ( @xmath63 ) , the relative orientation ( in @xmath64 , @xmath65 ) of ngc  205 s initial , undistorted disk , whether ngc  205 is on a prograde or retrograde orbit about m31 ( @xmath66 ) , and the hernquist ( 1990 ) scale length ( the radius at which a quarter mass is enclosed ) of ngc  205 s potential ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "the four final constraints are the three - component final velocity vector of ngc  205 s center of mass relative to m31 s center of mass ( @xmath68 ) , and the line - of - sight distance between ngc  205 and m31 ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "a detailed discussion of the upper and lower limits placed on each of these parameters is motivated and discussed in detail below .",

    "the motivation for using this separate parameter , @xmath66 , rather than just allowing @xmath65 to vary initially from @xmath103 to @xmath96 is that @xmath66 s binary nature provides an easy means for the genetic algorithm to instantly change the direction of the encounter via mutation or reproduction ( see  [ ssec_ga ] for more information on the genetic algorithm ) .",

    "there are five major steps involved in the simulation . for each individual orbit , the values of the unknown parameters described in  [ ssec_initial ]",
    "are obtained from the genetic algorithm as discussed in  [ ssec_ga ] . each step in a simulated orbit",
    "is described below :    \\1 .",
    "first , the center of mass ( com ) of ngc  205 is integrated back in time approximately half an orbit using a bulirsch stoer integration scheme @xcite .",
    "the presence of m31 s disk presents difficulties for performing straightforward calculations of the orbital period .",
    "hence , we approximate the orbital period as twice the circular velocity period of ngc  205 .",
    "although this approximation is far from exact , we intentionally overcompensate for the period to ensure that the satellite travels at least half an orbit or descends from a reasonably large radii .",
    "if the integration time is longer than 6.8 gyr the orbit is fixed to 6.7 gyr , since such orbits are much longer than the dynamical time scale for ngc  205 . since only the com s @xmath93 and @xmath94 positions are known precisely , the final @xmath69 position and the velocity vector ( @xmath213 ) must be taken from the genetic algorithm s initial parameter space .",
    "the acceleration is computed using a three - component potential model for m31 consisting of a bulge , a disk and a halo as described in  [ ssec_potential ] .",
    "we set the required accuracy per time step to one part in @xmath214 .",
    "\\2 . at this earlier time , we assume tidal distortion of ngc  205 has not yet taken place . after successful integration back in time , the initial , undistorted ngc  205 galaxy is created and populated with 1,000 mass - less test particles in a preselected configuration , as discussed in  [ ssec_particles ] .",
    "the distribution of test particles is not intended to be a self consistent tracer of the mass , rather , it is constructed to be a tracer of the expected surface brightness profile of ngc  205 prior to its distortion .",
    "next , the undistorted system of particles is integrated forward in time to the present day under the influence of both galaxies potentials . as discussed in  [ ssec_potential ] , we model ngc  205 as a spherically symmetric static potential and m31 as a three - component static potential .",
    "the mass , @xmath62 , and hernquist scale length , @xmath67 , used to construct ngc  205 s potential are unknown parameters and are obtained from the genetic algorithm .",
    "we set the required accuracy per particle per time step in our integration to one part in @xmath214 .",
    "the integration is complete , the final , simulated system is compared to the known , observed system .",
    "the comparison involves a total of 67 tests , depending on the model used for ngc  205 .",
    "although , individually , these tests report a probability measurement , their true purpose is to provide information to the ga instructing it on how to improve subsequent guesses .",
    "an outline of each test is provided in  [ ssec_fitness ] .",
    "steps 14 are repeated until the desired number of orbits is reached .",
    "we then use a genetic algorithm to improve our initial conditions and repeat the process until we can match our observations . for each orbit ,",
    "parameters resulting in a goodness - of - fit value higher than the previous value are recorded .",
    "steps 15 are then repeated using a new guesses for the free parameters .",
    "our 10-dimensional parameter space discussed in  [ ssec_initial ] contains approximately @xmath70 possible orbits . at an average of 6.25 cpu seconds an orbit for our simplest model , the cold disk ,",
    "an iterative search of the space would take on order @xmath215 cpu gyr .",
    "for this reason , we must efficiently search the parameter space with an optimization algorithm .",
    "we have chosen to use the optimization technique invented by @xcite called a genetic algorithm ( ga ) for two pragmatic reasons .",
    "the first is that gas have the distinct advantage of not getting stuck in local optima , a problem that plagues hill climbing techniques which exploit gradient information .",
    "the second benefit is that gas are reasonably effective at reducing the amount of searching needed to converge on a solution in a given parameter space .",
    "hence , gas are especially useful in problems where iterative searches are computational unreasonable .",
    "these two features make genetic algorithms ideal for searching parameter spaces containing an unknown distribution of local optima .    the inspiration behind the ga is biological evolution .",
    "the idea follows that evolution is a process determined by chromosomes and natural selection . in the ga application , an individual point in parameter space",
    "is equivalent to a _",
    "chromosome _ , and the parameters making up that chromosome are analogous to _ genes_. as dictated by biology",
    ", evolution occurs at the point of reproduction and individuals with genes advantageous to their species are more likely to reproduce .",
    "mutations of genes and recombination of chromosomes ( crossover ) can result in offspring that are very different than their biological parents , and , if these mutations and recombinations result in a higher level of success for the offspring , they become more likely to reproduce . with each new generation ,",
    "a new population is created and the old population is replaced .",
    "there are three general modules that define and drive all genetic algorithms .",
    "these are the _ evaluation , population and reproduction modules_. within any particular application , the details of each module can vary .",
    "the purpose of the _ evaluation module _ is to determine the _ fitness _ of a particular individual .",
    "fitness is a measure of an individual s feasibility as a solution to the problem at hand and is commonly determined by a mathematical function .",
    "the fitness is the only information fed into the genetic algorithm and is used in the _ population _ and _ reproduction modules_. at any given time , the _ population module _ hosts the current population of individuals , called a generation . encoded in this module",
    "are the existing population s chromosomes and the methods used for creating new generations ( e.g. how many children are produced by a set of parents ) .",
    "the method of parent selection ( e.g. roulette - wheel , stochastic tournament , deterministic sampling ) is often contained in this module as well , but can alternatively be a component in the _ reproduction module_. the _ population module _ begins by creating an initial population ( the first generation ) , which generally consists of random , single - point guesses in parameter space .",
    "the success of a given ga run only weakly depends on this initial first guess .",
    "the successive replacements of this population by the _ reproduction module _ results in new generations .",
    "the _ reproduction module _ determines the method by which new chromosomes will be created .",
    "the amount of mutation and the method of crossover ( the way the parent s chromosomes are combined to produce offspring ) are defined in this module .",
    "the resulting offspring becomes an individual of the next generation @xcite .",
    "we use a micro genetic algorithm ( micro - ga ) driver designed by @xcite which employs a tournament selection scheme with a shuffling technique to select individuals for reproduction .",
    "carroll s micro - ga is characterized by a small population ( 5 individuals ) , with uniform crossover , elitism and no mutation or niching .",
    "the algorithm works by first arranging individuals in the current population in some arbitrary order ( shuffling ) .",
    "two individuals are then randomly chosen from the population , and the fittest amongst the pair is selected as a parent ( tournament selection ) .",
    "tournament selection is then repeated to select the second parent .",
    "next , genes are picked at random from the first or second parent to create an offspring ( uniform crossover ) , which subsequently becomes a new member of the next generation .",
    "the process of selection and reproduction continues until the new generation is completely populated . in carroll s micro - ga configuration",
    ", elitism ensures that the best individual from the previous generation is replicated into the new generation and the absence of niching means that only one local optima can exist in a population at any given time .",
    "as previously discussed , the only interface between the ga and our @xmath0-body simulation is the _ evaluation module _ , which determines the fitness of an individual . for our problem",
    ", we use the photometric and kinematic observations discussed in  [ sec_observ ] to measure the fitness of each simulated orbit .",
    "since the fitness is a solitary number fed into the genetic algorithm , each simulated galaxy has its photometric and kinematic goodness - of - fit measurements weighted and combined into a single value .",
    "the goal of the fitness value is to tell the ga when and how to improve .",
    "hence , it is not advantageous to use a straightforward @xmath216 method ( especially since the simulated photometric and kinematic results are dependent on the same parameters ) , it is , in fact , more effective to weight and combine individual tests that measure the qualities of a given orbit . in our simulation , a total of 67 tests are used . after testing",

    "additionally , the ga is unable to reach convergence for the satellite s mass , @xmath62 , and hernquist scale length , @xmath67 .",
    "one explanation for this is that significant degeneracies might exist for @xmath62 and @xmath67 in the parameter space .",
    "a second possibility is that perhaps the photometric and kinematic fitness tests are not as sensitive to @xmath62 and @xmath67 as they are to the other parameters .",

    "although this line measures the velocity dispersion at a given radius , rather than the mean velocity dispersion , the result suggests that tidal interactions between at hot spheroid progenitor and parent galaxy have not significantly impacted the velocity dispersion within a 1 kpc radius .",

    "this paper presents the methods and results of an optimized , restricted @xmath0-body search for ngc  205 s orbit and system parameters .",
    "we account for uncertainties in the parameter space by placing very liberal upper and lower limits on our parameters , using three dynamically distinct models for the initial configuration of ngc  205 , and running our optimization algorithm ( ga ) 1000 times on each model .",
    "we find that out of the @xmath70 possible orbits , not only are certain orbits and portions of parameter space carved out , but this convergence is also model independent .",
    "these findings are outlined below :    * the simulations indicate that ngc  205 is approaching from the nw region on the plane of the sky , moving towards the se ( i.e. increasing in ra , decreasing in dec ) , with the cold disk model favoring an approach from the nw and the warm disk & hot spheroid models favoring the nnw . *",
    "these orbits do not trace out nor do they intersect the @xmath292 long stellar arc observed to north of m31 , which was hypothesized as a tidal stream emanating from ngc  205 by @xcite .",
    "orbits that trace out this region on the plane of the sky ( i.e. approaches from the nne through e region ) poorly match the photometry of ngc  205 , specifically , the isophotal twisting .",
    "instead , approaches from the nw - nnw region are preferred , thus ruling out the stellar arc as a trail of debris from ngc  205 .",
    "* large velocities in the range 300500 km  s@xmath3   are highly favored for ngc  205 . while the majority of the orbits found by the ga are bound , the best fitting orbits are either very close to escape velocity or unbound . however , such velocities are not completely uncommon for local group satellites .",
    "proper motion measurements reveal that the large magellanic cloud is very near escape velocity and likely on its first passage about the milky way @xcite . the dwarf spheroidal galaxies and xiv and and xii are near , or exceed , their local escape speeds and are presumably falling into the local group for the first time @xcite .",
    "the large tangential component of ngc  205 s simulated velocities translates into a proper motion of @xmath4 mas yr@xmath3 . *",
    "the ga is able to better fit ngc  205 s observed kinematic profile when the satellite s line - of - sight distance is very close to m31 . the resulting fits report relative distances between ngc  205 and m31 in the range 220 kpc .",
    "note that 2 kpc is our lower bound on the line sight distance parameter .",
    "these distances correspond to a change of @xmath381 mag in @xcite measurements of ngc  205 s red giant branch tip ( trgb ) , analogous to either an increase in their adopted trgb absolute magnitude ( @xmath382 ) and/or reddening correction ( @xmath383 ) , or in a decrease in the trgb observed magnitude ( @xmath384 ) .",
    "furthermore , this magnitude difference is in agreement with the @xmath385 mag errors quoted by @xcite on the individual distance measurements to ngc  205 and m31 . as an aside , a magnitude difference",
    "could also be accounted for by ngc  205 s composite stellar population @xcite resulting from a recent ( @xmath386 gyr ) burst of star formation @xcite .",
    "given these possible corrections and the close relative distances found by the simulation , the question is raised : _ could ngc  205 be in front of m31 rather than behind it ? _ * the disk models return tightly constrained initial scale lengths in the range 0.390.55 kpc , values approximately equal to ngc  205 s current scale length of 0.59 kpc .",
    "this result is consistent with the photometric and kinematic observations which suggest the central region of ngc  205 is largely unaffected by tides .",
    "hence , both the inner kinematics and photometry are determined by the initial parameters of the system . *",
    "the cold disk model demonstrates its plausibility as a configuration for ngc  205 by the induction of velocity dispersions into its initially cold profile via tidal interactions .",
    "hence , all three models contain some dispersion along their final semi - major axis velocity profile .",
    "* for the best fit hot spheroid model , we can reproduce the observed mean velocity dispersion of 35 km  s@xmath3and the semi - major axis velocity dispersion profile by using specific combinations of two otherwise unconstrained parameters , satellite mass ( @xmath62 ) and hernquist scale length ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "* for all three models , ngc  205 s large tangential velocities and close approaches to m31 indicate that it is difficult to distort a satellite to the extent that ngc  205 is observed . in order to reproduce the abrupt turnover and reversal in the velocity profile ,",
    "ngc  205 must come very near to m31 .",
    "while the photometric profile can be reproduced at large distances , the resulting velocity turnover is less abrupt and the reversal is not as steep .",
    "however , at very close approaches ( @xmath387 kpc ) , it is very easy to disrupt ngc  205 . in order to avoid complete disruption and/or long tidal streamers ,",
    "the satellite must approach m31 with a very high velocity .",
    "hence , the combined photometric and kinematic observations have managed to remove degeneracies in some of the parameter space . *",
    "the constrained orbits are primarily radial and projected to pass within 10 kpc of m31 s center . for the cold disk model , orbits that are not radial and have a fitness @xmath290 are prograde .",
    "in contrast , a larger fraction of the warm disk model s orbits with fitness @xmath290 are retrograde .",
    "this result is not surprising since the warm disk model contains some initial velocity dispersion , allowing its satellites to be more easily distorted .",
    "thus , some of the warm disk satellites are able to reproduced milder photometric distortions by approaching on retrograde orbits @xcite .",
    "* given that many of the best fitting orbits are both radial and unbound , it is not surprising that ngc  205 has only experienced a small amount of distortion .",
    "that is , an unbound orbit indicates that ngc  205 is on its first passage while satellites on radial orbits are more difficult to disrupt than those on prograde orbits @xcite .",
    "although the future projections show ngc  205 whizzing through m31 , inclusion of dynamical friction would change this result by slowing the satellite after hitting m31 for the first time @xcite .",
    "this braking mechanism is so efficient that it is likely ngc  205 will eventually merge with m31 .    although the ga s search was quite successful , it was unable to constrain the mass and dark matter content",
    ". this latter result could be due to either degeneracies in the parameter space or an insensitivity to these parameters by the fitness tests .",
    "furthermore , it appears that to some degree the algorithm did get stuck in local optima , a result evidenced by the scatter in the solutions and the fact that some orbits had very low fitness .",
    "although we attempt to circumvent this undesirable result by running the ga numerous times , we can not be 100% certain that we converge on the `` best orbit '' in the parameter space .",
    "however , we do find that other ga and fitness test configurations result in declining levels of a best orbit fitness and are thus confident that our method is effective .",
    "while other optimization tools are available ( i.e. simulated annealing ) , they too have their problems and limitations , and can not offer guaranteed improvements .",
    "we have presented the results of optimized restricted @xmath0-body simulations of ngc  205 s tidal interaction with m31 using initially self - consistent satellite models and parameter spaces tailored specifically to the system .",
    "although this simple model produces satisfactory results , improvements to the simulations will generate a more detailed and accurate account of the interaction , possibly produce tighter constraints on the parameters , and provide greater insight into the past , present and future of ngc  205 . in this final section",
    "we discuss two observational advances that can be made and a handful of numerical improvements that can be applied to the ngc  205-m31 system in order to better and more accurately model their interaction .",
    "the simulations can be significantly improved by reducing the observational errors .",
    "as discussed , the current value for the line - of - sight distance between ngc  205 and m31 is estimated to be @xmath388 kpc @xcite .",
    "an improvement on the relative distance between ngc  205 and m31 would significantly constrain the parameter space . in addition , if ngc  205 indeed has a large tangential motion of @xmath2 km  s@xmath3 , the satellite s proper motion could be resolved at long wavelengths over the course of a decade or two , thus providing another significant constraint on the system .",
    "these two measurements , in conjunction with current sky positions , radial velocities , and models of m31 s mass distribution , would provide a complete description of ngc  205 s orbit .",
    "our simple model of ngc  205 s interaction with m31 yields results that are consistent and relatively independent of model type .",
    "an obvious improvement to the current simulation is to use velocity dispersion as a constraint on the system .",
    "another improvement , applying to only the spheroid model , would be to weight the brightness of the mass - less test particles such that the initial surface brightness profile matches the observed exponential profile of ngc  205 .",
    "furthermore , this system can be better modeled with the inclusion of dynamical friction and mass loss , effects which act to slow the system down and increase the level of distortion in the satellite .",
    "the addition of these processes effectively transforms our time - independent model into a time - dependent problem .",
    "another modification is to construct ngc  205 as a self gravitating model with both dark and luminous particles , thus switching from a restricted @xmath0-body to a full @xmath0-body simulation .",
    "however , this more realistic model changes the problem from @xmath389 to a @xmath390 , leading to a notable increase in computation time and making it extremely costly to run the simulation along with a genetic algorithm . despite this complication",
    ", a self - gravitating model has a significant advantage in that it allows for evolution in ngc  205 .",
    "this construction provides the necessary platform to test various formation scenarios for the satellite since it can be initialized as a spiral or dirr and then transformed into a de through tidal interactions .",
    "if this improvement were to be made , one might also consider adding an initial gas mass to the progenitor galaxy and performing hydrodynamic simulations for completeness .",
    "last but not least , ngc  205 s orbit can be improved by adding the perturbations from m31 s other satellites , such as m32 , as well as the potential of the milky way .",
