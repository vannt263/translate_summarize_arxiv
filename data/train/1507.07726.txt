    "instead of searching for an action which is invariant under the conformal transformations , one can define a new metric tensor which is conformally invariant by itself . writing any gravity action with this new metric tensor",
    "will then results in a conformally invariant gravity theory .",
    "this was recently done by chamseddin and mukhanov @xcite where they have defined a new metric tensor , made of a dynamical metric tensor and a scalar field as g_=-g___^.[moa1 ] the metric @xmath1 is invariant under the weyl transformation on @xmath2 as _ ^2(x)_.[2 ] writing the usual einstein - hilbert action with the above new metric leads to a gravitational theory with an extra degree of freedom which behaves like a dust @xcite .",
    "so , one has a new pressureless matter fluid with geometric origin which can play the role of cold dark matter sector of the universe . the theory is dubbed  mimetic dark matter \" .",
    "an immediate consequence of definition is that the scalar field should satisfy the relation [ cons ] g^__=-1 .",
    "this means that the gradient of the scalar field should be timelike vector field everywhere",
    ". one can add the above equation into the action as a constraint through lagrange multiplier .",
    "it turns out that both actions yield the same field equations @xcite .",
    "many works have been done in the context of mimetic dark matter theory , including the hamiltonian analysis @xcite , cosmological perturbations @xcite , and other generalizations of the theory @xcite .",
    "the constraint equation actually breaks the lorentz invariance of the action by defining a preferred timelike direction in the space - time .",
    "such theories has been considered vastly in the literature , known as  einstein - aether \" theories @xcite . in these theories a timelike vector field , known as aether vector , is introduced to the theory through a lagrange multiplier .",
    "many works has been done in the context of einstein - aether theory , including cosmology @xcite and black hole solutions @xcite .",
    "one of the interesting facts about the einstein - aether theory is that it can be considered as a low energy limit of the horava - lifshitz gravity @xcite if the aether vector is hypersurface orthogonal . in order to make the aether vector hypersurface orthogonal",
    ", one can define the aether as the gradient of a scalar field @xmath3 as @xmath4 this changes the einstein - aether theory to a gravitational theory with an extra scalar degree of freedom with a timelike gradient .",
    "assuming that the gradient of the scalar field @xmath3 has a unit norm , makes the einstein - aether theory and the mimetic dark matter theory very similar .",
    "the main difference between these two theories is that the einstein - aether theory has some self - interaction terms for the aether vector .",
    "the first attempt to add some kinetic terms ( other than the canonical kinetic term which is already present in the theory ) to the action of mimetic dark matter theory was done in @xcite by writing the scalar version of the einstein - aether theory using the substitution @xmath5 .",
    "the theory can then be considered as a scalar eintein - aether gravity @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the resulting theory is equivalent to the projectable horava - lifshitz gravity which is known to have ghost and strong coupling problems .",
    "this problem can simply be solved by adding to the theory a potential term which breaks the shift symmetry on the scalar field @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "however , one can add some other , i.e. healthy , self - interactions to the mimetic gravity action which makes the theory different from the projectable horava - lifshitz gravity , and in the mean time keeps the shift symmetry on the scalar field . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors have added galileon self - interactions to the mimetic action making sure that the theory does not suffer from the ostrogradski instability .",
    "the resulting theory can then explain the late - time accelerated expansion even in the dust dominated universe . in @xcite , the authors have considered the term @xmath7 to the mimetic action which simultaneously has higher derivative terms and breaks the scalar shift symmetry .",
    "it is interesting to note that the einstein - hilbert action plus the above term with constant @xmath8 in the context of mimetic theory can be written as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the extrinsic curvature and @xmath11 is its trace .",
    "also we have used @xmath12 to show the metric on the spacial hypersurface .",
    "this adm form of the action shows that the following action breaks the lorentz invariant and produces the canonical kinetic term of the horava - lifshitz gravity @xcite .",
    "one can also add some potential term for the scalar field to the action in order to explain the effect of dark energy in this model @xcite .",
    "beside adding higher order interaction terms to the action , one can make the geometry richer to obtain the self - accelerated expanding universe .",
    "one of the most interesting theories in this category is that of @xmath0 gravity . constructing the @xmath0 action with the effective metric may cause the universe to accelerate @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors have considered the dynamical system analysis of such model and showed that the universe has a stable accelerated expanding mode .",
    "it will then be very interesting to investigate the parameter space of the theory from the energy condition point of view .",
    "the mimetic-@xmath0 theory can be considered as a gravitational theory coupled to a geometrical dark matter field which corresponds to the scalar field @xmath6 .",
    "the modification of geometry is then responsible for the late - time accelerated expansion of the universe . by rewriting the theory as a brans - dicke theory with @xmath13 ,",
    "the expansion of the universe will be encoded to a dynamical scalar field . in this sense",
    "the model can be considered as a gravitational theory coupled to two scalar degrees of freedom which are responsible for both dark sectors of our universe .    despite the fact that the @xmath0 gravity theories are very interesting and useful",
    ", they may suffer from instabilities . in 2003 , dolgov and kawasaki @xcite showed that the higher derivative theories may have an instability dropping the theory to a strong curvature regime in a very short time .",
    "one can obtain a constraint on the form of @xmath0 to avoid such an instability @xcite .",
    "it is very interesting that the palatini-@xmath0 gravity does not have such an instability @xcite .",
    "in @xcite the authors found an example of @xmath0 gravity which passes the dolgov - kawasaki instability .",
    "the dolgov - kawasaki instability has been studied in the various versions of higher derivative gravities , including theories with non - minimal coupling between matter and geometry @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we will obtain the conditions on the form of @xmath0 to avoid the dolgov - kawasaki instability of the mimetic-@xmath0 theory .",
    "we will see that the result is the same as standard @xmath0 gravity , due to the fact that the dark matter sector can not be responsible for the dolgov - kawasaki instability .",
    "the main purpose of the present work is to consider the energy conditions of the mimetic-@xmath0 theory and make some constraints on the parameter space of the theory , in order to explain the late - time accelerated expansion of the universe ( for recent literature on the energy conditions of extended theories of gravity see @xcite ) . for this purpose",
    ", one should violate the strong energy condition .",
    "the standard baryonic matter does not have such a property .",
    "however , the present model as well as all modified gravity theories , can violate the strong energy condition by choosing the dynamics of the extra d.o.f properly .",
    "this obviously does not affect the healthy behavior of the baryonic matter as long as it is independently conserved .",
    "one should note that the weak , null and dominant energy conditions should not be violated . in this paper",
    ", we will obtain the conditions of violating the strong energy condition for three different / important choices of the function @xmath0 , i.e. the power law , the exponential case and also the mixed case .",
    "the energy conditions can be inferred from the raychaudhuri equation which is the temporal evolution of the expansion scalar @xcite . in the case where the matter content of the universe can be expressed as a perfect fluid , one can write @xcite    * weak energy condition ( wec ) : @xmath14 * null energy condition ( nec ) : @xmath15 * strong energy condition ( sec ) : @xmath16 * dominant energy condition ( dec ) : @xmath17    we will see that the energy - momentum tensor of the present model has the form of a perfect fluid .",
    "so , we will use the above relations for analysing the energy conditions of the theory .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows : in the next section we will obtain the field equations of the model and construct its effective energy momentum tensor . we will then discuss about the relations of the theory with the brans - dicke theory in section [ secbd ] . the dolgov - kawasaki instability analysis will be discussed in section [ secdk ] . in section [ secec ]",
    "we will obtain the energy conditions and consider some special cases for the function @xmath0 . in section [ secdis ] we will summarize the results and make some discussions .",
    "let us consider the @xmath0 gravity action in the mimetic theory [ mifraction ] s = d^4 x ( f(r(g _ , ) ) + _ ) , where @xmath18 is the matter lagrangian and the physical metric @xmath1 is related to the auxiliary metric @xmath2 and the scalar field @xmath6 as in equation which yields the constraint equation .",
    "the field equations can be obtained by varying the action with respect to the metric @xmath2 and the scalar field @xmath6 with the result @xmath19 and [ eqphi ] ^=0 , where _ prime _ denotes derivative with respect to the argument , and @xmath3 is the trace of energy - momentum tensor .    by taking the covariant derivative of the metric field equation one",
    "can obtain ^t_=0 , where we have used the scalar field equation and @xmath20 obtained by taking the covariant derivative of .",
    "so , the ordinary matter energy - momentum tensor is independently conserved in this theory .",
    "this suggests that the massive test particles in this theory move along the geodesics , and no extra forces is present here @xcite .    from equation",
    ", one can obtain [ phi2 ] ( 2f -r f^-3f^+t)_=c _ , where @xmath21 is an integration constant .",
    "it is clear from equation that the vector density @xmath21 is either zero or time - like .",
    "one can see from equations and that in the case of vanishing @xmath21 the theory reduces to the standard @xmath0 gravity . in this paper",
    "we will consider non - zero values of @xmath21 and compare the results with the standard @xmath0 gravity case @xmath22 .",
    "substituting equation into , one can obtain @xmath23 the above form of the metric field equations mimic the standard @xmath0 gravity except the last term in the right hand side which is due to the presence of a constraint on the scalar field .",
    "one should mention that @xmath24 plays the role of modified gravitational constant which should be positive . in the following",
    ", we will impose this contraint for the analysis of energy condition .    from equation",
    "one can define the effective energy - momentum tensor as @xmath25 which is conserved , @xmath26 , by definition .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the same procedure of @xcite can be done in the present case to show that is equivalent to the action @xmath27 in this form , the scalar field @xmath6 is minimally coupled to the metric and the constraint equation is added to action through the lagrange multiplier . to obtain the field equations",
    "one should vary the above action with respect to @xmath28 , the metric tensor @xmath1 and @xmath6 .",
    "the results are exactly the same as , and .",
    "as is well - known , the standard @xmath0 gravity is equivalent to the brans - dicke theory with the parameter @xmath13 .",
    "let us consider the equivalence between mimetic-@xmath0 gravity and brans - dicke theory in the absence of the matter lagrangian .",
    "the legendre transformation for the lagrangian can be written as @xmath29 where @xmath30 where the _ prime _ denotes derivation with respect to the argument .",
    "the above action shows that the action is also equivalent to the brans - dicke theory with parameter @xmath13 .",
    "the only difference between the usual brans - dicke theory and the above action is that the physical metric is defined by the relation .",
    "so , we can call this theory as mimetic - brans - dicke theory . to obtain the field equations one should vary the action with respect to the @xmath31 , @xmath6 and @xmath2 .",
    "the results are    [ bd1 ] @xmath32    together with equation .",
    "we note that @xmath33 is the trace of einstein tensor . in the above equations the covariant derivatives and",
    "also the einstein tensor are constructed from the physical metric @xmath1 .",
    "if we use the action for the mimetic-@xmath0 gravity instead of and performed the legendre transformation , we would obtain @xmath34,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 it can be easily seen that the above action is the brans - dicke theory with @xmath13 which minimally couples to a constrained scalar field through the lagrange multiplier . by varying the action with respect to the @xmath31 , @xmath1 and @xmath6 , one",
    "will obtain the same equations .",
    "the @xmath28 field equation then gives .",
    "in this section we will obtain the dolgov - kawasaki criterion for mimetic-@xmath0 gravity theory .",
    "we will use the standard procedure of @xcite .",
    "suppose that the ricci scalar differs from its background value @xmath36 by @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is a perturbation around @xmath36 .",
    "also assume that the scalar field is perturbed from its background value @xmath39 as @xmath40 . in order to be consistent with solar system tests",
    ", we also assume that the function @xmath0 is very close to the ricci scalar @xmath41 with these assumptions , one can expand the various derivatives of the function @xmath0 as @xmath42 where @xmath43 .",
    "we have also assumed that the metric is very close to the minkowski so that one can write @xmath44 one should note that we have two dynamical and one constraint equations . in order to study the perturbations of the ricci scalar we have to take the trace of metric field equation .",
    "the trace of equation vanishes after using the constraint equation . expanding the constraint equation upto first order gives @xmath45 with implies that @xmath46 .",
    "so we need to consider only the scalar field equation .",
    "multiplying the scalar field equation by @xmath47 and using the constraint equation , one can obtain @xmath48 expanding the above equation up to first order gives @xmath49 where we have defined @xmath50 one can see that the effective potential of the mimetic theory is changed due to the presence of a constrained scalar field .",
    "the effective mass is dominated by its first term which implies a constraint @xmath51 for a theory to avoid tachyonic instability .",
    "we note that @xmath52 .",
    "so , the present theory has the criteria @xmath53 to avoid dolgov - kawsaki instability ( see also @xcite . )",
    "we note that the same condition is hold for @xmath54 theory .",
    "however , non - minimal couplings between the ricci tensor and the energy - momentum tensor can modify the above condition @xcite . in the following",
    "we will impose this constraint for analysing the energy conditions of the theory .",
    "let us consider the flat frw universe ds^2=-dt^2+a(t)^2(dx^2+dy^2+dz^2 ) , which is filled with a perfect fluid with energy - momentum tensor t_=(p+)u_u_+pg _ , where @xmath55 is the energy density and @xmath56 is the pressure . in this case , from equation , one can obtain ( t)=t + c where @xmath57 is an integration constant .",
    "the scalar field @xmath6 always appears with derivative , hence the theory has a shift symmetry on @xmath6 , so we can set @xmath58 without loss of generality .",

    "the effective energy - momentum tensor becomes diagonal with components @xmath61 using the above relations , the energy conditions for our model can be written as    * wec:@xmath62 , * sec:@xmath63 , * nec:@xmath64 , * dec:@xmath65 .",
    "the weak energy condition should be positive because it represents the energy content of the universe .",
    "however , in order to have an accelerated expanding universe , the strong energy condition should be violated . in the following",
    "we will focus on the values of the parameter space which breaks the strong energy condition , keeping the other three conditions positive and satisfy @xmath66 and @xmath67 .    in order to put a better constraint on the parameters of the theory ,",
    "it is helpful to write the energy conditions in terms of the hubble parameter , deceleration parameter , jerk and snap with the definitions @xmath68 the present day values of the deceleration parameter , the jerk and the hubble parameter are @xmath69 and @xmath70 @xcite and @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , we do not have any experimental data for the snap parameter .",
    "in the standard @xmath0 gravity theory , one can use only the weak energy condition which does not have the snap @xcite .",

    "in this paper we have considered the @xmath0 gravity in the context of mimetic dark matter theory .",
    "the mimetic dark matter theory introduces a very simple procedure to construct a conformally invariant gravitational action by expressing the physical metric in terms of a scalar field and a dynamical metric .",
    "surprisingly , this procedure results in a degree of freedom which behaves like a dust and can be considered as a geometrical candidate of dark matter .",
    "the action is equivalent to a gravitational theory with a constraint which is added by a lagrange multiplier . in this point of view",
    ", the lagrange multiplier plays the role of the energy density of dark matter and the covariant derivative of the scalar field plays the role of its velocity .",
    "one of the interesting fact about the mimetic theory is that the equation of motion of the metric tensor has a general form @xmath175 here @xmath176 is the metric field equation in the non - mimetic gravity theory .",
    "the presence of scalar field results in the addition of @xmath177 to the metric equation . in the lagrange multiplier point of view , the trace of the metric equation is the lagrange multiplier itself , which represents the energy density of the dark matter .",
    "the @xmath0 gravity theory is equivalent to the special case of mimetic-@xmath0 theory with vanishing @xmath84 ( see equation ) .",
    "so , the mimetic-@xmath0 theory is more general , in the sense that it yields more solutions and provides a wider range of parameters with respect to the cases of non - vanishing @xmath84 .",
    "the mimetic-@xmath0 theory is equivalent to a gravitational theory with two scalar fields .",
    "one of them is responsible for the dark matter sector of the universe and makes the theory conformally invariant .",
    "the other is a scalar field which is added to the action via brans - dicke interaction with @xmath13 , and is responsible for the dark energy content of the universe and makes the universe accelerate .",
    "the dolgov - kawasaki criterion can be found to be equivalent to the usual @xmath0 gravity theory .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the mimetic theory only adds a dust like scalar field which can not change the behavior of the expansion radically .",
    "however , as we have seen in this paper , the existence of this scalar field can change the parameter space of the theory .",
    "the energy condition analysis of the theory shows that various forms of @xmath0 can be used to obtain the accelerating universe . in the case",
    "@xmath178 , we have shown that for positive values of @xmath95 , the constant @xmath108 should always be in the range @xmath122 .",
    "this means that the ordinary @xmath0 gravity with positive coupling can not produce a healthy accelerating phase for our universe .",
    "however , with negative values of the coupling @xmath95 one can have reliable accelerating cosmology for both signs of @xmath108 and also for @xmath120 . in the case",
    "@xmath179 , we have shown that in order that gravity remains attractive and the dolgov - kawasaki instability disappears , both the parameters @xmath107 and @xmath95 should be positive .",
    "an interesting fact about this case is that the parameter @xmath108 is bounded from below with @xmath180 .",
    "we have also considered a more general case @xmath181 .",
    "we have seen that for both signs of the coupling @xmath95 , the @xmath120 case can produce a healthy accelerating universe . in the case",
    "@xmath144 , the @xmath148 values gives more parameter range .    in summary ,",
    "we have seen in this paper that the mimetic-@xmath0 gravity generalizes the @xmath0 gravity theory which gives us more parameter space .",
    "this will produce an accelerating phase of the universe , keeping the weak , dominant and null energy conditions positive , and remaining in the validity domain of dolgov - kawasaki criterion .",
