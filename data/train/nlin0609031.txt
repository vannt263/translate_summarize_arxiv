    "recent experimental developments in the fields of nonlinear optics and bose - einstein condensation provide unique opportunities for the studies of many nonlinear phenomena .",
    "moreover , due to a formal similarity of the gross - pitaevskii equation for the dynamics of matter waves and the nonlinear schrdinger equation for light propagating in a nonlinear kerr medium , it is possible to interchange and transfer many interesting ideas between these two fields .",
    "one of them is the generation of nonspreading localized wavepackets usually called _ optical solitons _ or _ matter - wave solitons _  @xcite .",
    "bright solitons , which are quite common objects in different problems of nonlinear optics , have been only recently demonstrated in two independent experiments with matter waves  @xcite . in this case , the wavepacket spreading due to dispersion is compensated by an attractive interaction between atoms .",
    "both optical and matter - wave solitons can also be formed due to an interplay between nonlinearity and periodicity  @xcite .    in optics ,",
    "the presence of a periodically varying refractive index of a medium results in a bandgap structure of the transmission spectrum of light .",
    "this subsequently affects the propagation of optical beams ( pulses ) , which is determined by the diffraction ( dispersion ) curves of the transmission bands and forbidden gaps of the wave spectrum .",
    "it was demonstrated that periodic structures can modify dramatically the wave diffraction  @xcite , and therefore they introduce a novel way for controlling self - action of light in nonlinear periodic media  @xcite . in particular , if the refractive index decreases with the light intensity due to a nonlinearity - induced response of the material , the beam normally experiences broadening due to self - defocusing .",
    "however , in periodic photonic structures , the same type of defocusing nonlinearity can lead to the beam localization  @xcite . for deep periodic modulations",
    ", this effect should result in the formation of discrete solitons .",
    "indeed , as was shown both numerically and experimentally in ref .",
    "@xcite , increasing the depth of the refractive index modulation leads to a sharp crossover between the continuous and discrete properties of the lattice .",
    "it is manifested in a specific type of light localization and gap - soliton generation which become possible for a self - defocusing medium only in case of a discrete model .",
    "analogous effect of the gap - soliton generation in the regime of repulsive interaction was observed for the bose - einstein condensates . this first experimental observation  @xcite was reported for @xmath0rb atoms in a weak optical lattice . in this case , the anomalous dispersion of the atomic cloud is realized at the edge of the brillouin zone ; if the coherent atomic wave packet is prepared in the corresponding state , a matter - wave gap soliton is formed inside the spectral gap .",
    "however , it took a considerable experimental effort to generate the initial state of the bose - einstein condensate in a proper way , by introducing an acceleration to the optical lattice and other tricks  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we reveal that the matter - wave gap solitons can be generated by a simpler and straightforward method that allows to create stable , long - lived gap solitons of a repulsive bose - einstein condensate in a one - dimensional optical lattice . in our scenario ,",
    "the gap soliton is formed from an initial ground state of a harmonic trap after turning on the optical lattice , due to the cloud relaxation rather than as a result of preparing the initial atomic wavepacket at a certain point of the band gap structure .",
    "in addition , we demonstrate that losses during this process can be suppressed by an appropriate adiabatic switching of the optical lattice .",

    "we also introduce the depth @xmath10 and period @xmath11 of an optical lattice .",
    "temporal variations of the potential are described by two functions , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , which account for the adiabatic processes of turning off the longitudinal part of the harmonic trap and turning on the optical lattice over the stationary condensate .",
    "more details about this tuning will follow in the next section .",
    "in our numerical calculations , we use both three - dimensional model and ( more often ) quasi - one - dimensional reduced model , in which we assume that the transverse harmonic confinement is so tight that no transverse excitations occur  @xcite . as a result of this assumption , the three - dimensional wave function resembles the transverse ground state of a harmonic potential in the transverse cross - section , and the nonlinear dynamics can be described by a one - dimensional gross - pitaevskii equation after rescaling the nonlinear coefficient , @xmath14 .",

    "moreover , the matter - wave gap solitons created in this way are very narrow , and they occupy only a few lattice sites . in addition , the loading efficiency is relatively low .",
    "for that reason , below we suggest and discuss in detail the other method for generating matter - wave gap solitons . in this second scenario ,",

    "[ varn ] , we monitor the efficiency of the soliton generation by counting the atoms that remain after @xmath38s within the window of 200 microns around the central peak . this choice is somehow arbitrary , but the result does not depend qualitatively on the size of the window . we observe that our adiabatic scheme allows to achieve almost 100% generation efficiency in a broad range of the initial atom number .",
    "we also reveal that there exists a limit in the final number of atoms that we can trap into the gap soliton .",
    "both the schemes display saturation above 1000 atoms .",
    "we can estimate the maximal number of atoms that can be trapped in the soliton by employing the effective - mass approximation and assuming that the size of the soliton can not be smaller than one lattice well . using the parameters given above we estimate the upper limit to be around 1200 atoms , that is by almost five times larger that that reported in the first experimental observation  @xcite .",
