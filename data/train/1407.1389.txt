    "the famous kasparov absorption theorem states that any countably generated hilbert @xmath0-module @xmath1 over any @xmath0-algebra @xmath2 is a direct summand in a free hilbert @xmath0-module , @xcite .",
    "one may thus think of hilbert @xmath0-modules as a natural generalization of finitely generated projective modules over @xmath0-algebras .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to prove a version of the kasparov absorption theorem which takes into account any differentiable structure which may exist on the base @xmath0-algebra @xmath2 . following the scheme of noncommutative geometry , this extra differentiable structure",
    "will be encoded in a densely defined derivation @xmath3 which is compatible with the adjoint operation , @xcite .",
    "one of the main applications of the kasparov absorption theorem is to the construction of the interior kasparov product in @xmath4-theory , @xcite .",
    "consequently , we expect that the differentiable absorption theorem will play an important role for the current investigations of the unbounded version of the interior kasparov product , @xcite",
    ".    among the challenges which arise during the construction of the unbounded kasparov product one encounters the following : consider an unbounded ( selfadjoint and regular ) operator @xmath5 acting on an auxiliary hilbert @xmath0-module @xmath6 which carries an action of @xmath2 .",
    "suppose that @xmath5 implements the densely defined derivation on @xmath2 by taking commutators .",
    "is it then possible to construct :    1 .   a hermitian connection @xmath7 which is densely defined on @xmath1 ?",
    "2 .   an unbounded operator @xmath8 which is densely defined on the interior tensor product of @xmath1 and @xmath6 and which has the _ formal _ expression @xmath9 , where @xmath10 denotes the `` clifford action '' ?    the second purpose of this paper is to provide a detailed discussion of these problems .    before we go any further ,",
    "let us state the kasparov absorption theorem .",
    "let @xmath11 denote the standard module consisting of square summable sequences in @xmath2 .",
    "there exists a bounded adjointable isometry @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath13 denote the associated orthogonal projection and let us choose a dense @xmath14-subalgebra @xmath15 which is included in the domain of the derivation @xmath3 .",
    "suppose now that @xmath16 is represented by an infinite matrix @xmath17 of elements in @xmath18 .",
    "we are then interested in analyzing ( the operator norm of ) the derivative @xmath19 .",
    "our first remark is that it is known from examples that @xmath20 need _ not _ be a bounded operator , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 6.18 ) for the concrete case of the ( @xmath21-deformed ) hopf fibration and @xcite for a general discussion in the commutative case .",
    "the main idea of the differentiable absorption theorem is to introduce an extra bounded operator which regularizes the growth of the derivative @xmath20 .",
    "we will accomplish this task under the following minimal assumption :    there exists a sequence @xmath22 of generators for @xmath1 such that the inner product @xmath23 lies in @xmath18 for all @xmath24 .    in order to state our result ,",
    "let us introduce the notation @xmath25 for the compact operators on the standard module @xmath11 and @xmath26 for the _ differentiable _ compact operators .",

    "@xmath29 2 .",
    "@xmath30 has dense image .",
    "3 .   @xmath31 4 .   @xmath32    where @xmath13 is the associated orthogonal projection .",
    "our first main application of the differentiable absorption theorem is to construct a densely defined gramann connection . to explain this result ,",
    "let @xmath33 denote the smallest @xmath0-subalgebra which contains @xmath2 and the image of the derivation @xmath34 .",
    "we think of @xmath35 as an analogue of the continuous forms on a manifold .",
    "the gramann connection is then _ formally _ given by the formula @xmath36 .",
    "the main problem is however to show that this expression makes sense and yields a _",
    "densely defined _",
    "@xmath37-linear map on the direct summand @xmath38 with values in the interior tensor product @xmath39 .",
    "this relies heavily on the differentiable absorption theorem .",
    "in order to state the properties of our gramann connection we introduce the following pairing : @xmath40    [ t : graconint ] there exists a dense @xmath18-submodule @xmath41 and a @xmath37-linear map @xmath42 which satisfies the leibniz rule and is hermitian , in the sense that    1 .",
    "@xmath43 2 .",
    "@xmath44    for all @xmath45 and all @xmath46 .",
    "we would like to emphasize that our notion of connection is different from previous notions of connections in noncommutative geometry , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 8) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* part ii , definition 18 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* definition 1.7 ) .",
    "one of the main differences is here that the range of the connection , thus the hilbert @xmath0-module @xmath47 is not defined algebraically ( we have passed to a completion of the algebraic tensor product @xmath48 ) .",
    "this is an important difference which allows us to deal with hilbert @xmath0-modules which are not necessarily finitely generated projective .",
    "notice also that the context of hilbert @xmath0-modules also allows us to formulate the second condition of hermitianness for our connections .    with the gramann connection @xmath49 in hand we can make sense of the following operator at the _ algebraic level _",
    ": @xmath50 thus @xmath51 denotes the tensor product of modules over @xmath18 , whereas @xmath52 denotes the interior tensor product of hilbert @xmath0-modules .",
    "let now @xmath53 denote the hilbert @xmath0-module of square - summable sequences in @xmath6 .",
    "in order to have a well - defined ( and more manageable ) unbounded operator we replace @xmath54 with the contraction @xmath55 where @xmath56 is an orthogonal projection induced by @xmath57 and @xmath58 is the diagonal operator induced by @xmath59 we are interested in understanding the properties of the contraction @xmath60 .",
    "more precisely , we investigate two fundamental questions :    1 .",
    "is the closure of the contraction @xmath60 selfadjoint ? 2 .",
    "is the closure of the contraction @xmath60 regular ?    in general , the contraction need not be essentially selfadjoint : indeed , by analyzing our construction for the half - line , we see that @xmath60 provides a symmetric extension of the dirac operator @xmath61 .",
    "this dirac operator has no selfadjoint extensions due to a mismatch of the deficiency indices .",
    "we do not have a counterexample to regularity but we strongly believe that such an example exists .    in order to solve this lack of selfadjointness ( and possibly also of regularity ) we modify the contraction @xmath60 by multiplying it from the left and from the right with the positive selfadjoint bounded operator with dense image , @xmath62 .",
    "we then obtain our third main result :    [ t : selregint ] suppose that @xmath12 and @xmath28 satisfy the properties stated in the differentiable absorption theorem .",
    "then the closure of the unbounded operator @xmath63 is selfadjoint and regular .",
    "the plan of the present paper is as follows :    in section [ s : conabs ] we provide a novel proof of the kasparov absorption theorem .",
    "the usual proof consists of first stabilizing @xmath1 with the standard module @xmath11 and then construct a bounded adjointable operator @xmath64 such that both @xmath65 and @xmath66 have dense image .",
    "this yields a unitary isomorphism @xmath67 by taking polar decompositions , see for example ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.3 ) or ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.4 ) .",
    "another ( and slightly more concrete ) possibility is to apply a version of the gram - schmidt orthonormalization procedure to the generators of the hilbert @xmath0-module ( after stabilizing with the standard module ) , see for example ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2 ) . with both of these methods",
    ", it seems impossible to obtain any control on the growth of the derivative of the associated orthogonal projection @xmath16 .",
    "our new proof is straightforward and basically consists of choosing better and better approximations to the inverse of the infinite matrix @xmath68 induced by the sequence of generators . with this procedure",
    ", we do not need to stabilize @xmath1 by adding the standard module @xmath11 .    in section [ s :",
    "difabs ] we give a proof of the differentiable absorption theorem .",
    "as noted above , this is only possible because our construction of the bounded adjointable isometry @xmath12 is more explicit than the usual construction .",
    "the extra bounded operator @xmath28 also has a simple description in terms of the generators of the hilbert @xmath0-module ( it is basically nothing but the operator @xmath69 ) .",
    "in section [ s : gracon ] we apply the differentiable absorption theorem to construct a densely defined gramann connection on the hilbert @xmath0-module @xmath1 , see theorem [ t : graconint ] .    in section [ s : symsel ]",
    "we investigate the properties of the associated symmetric lift @xmath54 and we show that it need not be selfadjoint in general .    in section [ s : comregunb ]",
    "we analyze the following general question : given a selfadjoint and regular operator @xmath70 and a bounded selfadjoint operator @xmath71 , what can we then say about the selfadjointness and regularity of the product @xmath72 ?",
    "this part relies on our earlier investigations with m. lesch which led to a local - global principle for regular unbounded operators , see @xcite .",
    "in section [ s : selreg ] we provide a proof of theorem [ t : selregint ] which relies on the achievements of the preceding sections .    even though some of the concepts introduced in section [ s : difabs ] and section [ s : gracon ]",
    "are more naturally understood in the framework of operator modules we have decided to avoid this terminology in order to keep the exposition as simple as possible .",
    "we refer the reader who is interested in operator modules and their relation to hilbert @xmath0-modules to the following two beautiful papers by d. blecher , @xcite .",
