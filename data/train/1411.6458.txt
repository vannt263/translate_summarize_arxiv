    "the first consequence of theorem [ main theorem ] in the symplectic category follows from the fact that , if the action is hamiltonian , @xmath31 can never be identically zero ( see remark [ h ham ] ) , and the index coincides with the minimal chern number ( see remark [ mcn ] ) , leading to the following    [ minimal chern ham ] let @xmath87 be a compact , connected symplectic manifold of dimension @xmath1 .",

    "it is only very recently that tolman announced the following striking result :    [ tolman 6 ] there exists a non - hamiltonian symplectic circle action with exactly 32 fixed points on a closed , connected , six - dimensional symplectic manifold @xmath97 .",

    "<S> let @xmath0 be a compact , connected , almost complex manifold of dimension @xmath1 endowed with a @xmath2-preserving circle action with isolated fixed points . </S>",
    "<S> in this note we analyse the ` geography problem ' for such manifolds , deriving equations relating the chern numbers to the index @xmath3 of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we study the symmetries and zeros of the hilbert polynomial associated to @xmath0 , which imply many rigidity results for the chern numbers when @xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> we apply these results to the category of compact , connected symplectic manifolds . a long - standing question posed by mcduff and salamon @xcite , also known as the ` mcduff conjecture ' , asked about the existence of non - hamiltonian actions with isolated fixed points . </S>",
    "<S> this question was answered recently by tolman @xcite , with an explicit construction of a six - dimensional manifold with such an action . </S>",
    "<S> one issue that this raises is whether one can find topological criteria that ensure the manifold can only support a hamiltonian or only a non - hamiltonian action . in this vein </S>",
    "<S> , we are able to deduce such criteria from our rigidity theorems in terms of relatively few chern numbers , depending on the index . </S>",
    "<S> this improves upon results of feldman @xcite for which one needs to know the entire todd genus .    </S>",
    "<S> another consequence of our work is that , in the situation above with a hamiltonian action , the minimal chern number coincides with the index and is at most @xmath5 , mirroring results of michelsohn @xcite in the complex category and hattori @xcite in the almost complex category . </S>"
