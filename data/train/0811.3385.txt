    "key aspects of the core - collapse supernova explosion mechanism remain unknown .",
    "it is known that a shock wave forms when the central density of a collapsing massive star ( @xmath0 ) exceeds nuclear density : at this point the repulsive short - range nuclear force stiffens the equation of state ( eos ) , and the resulting core bounce gives rise to a compression wave that steepens into a shock when it reaches the sonic point that separates the subsonically collapsing inner stellar core from the supersonically infalling outer core .",
    "as the roughly spherical shock wave propagates radially outward through infalling material it loses energy through dissociation of heavy nuclei and neutrino emission , eventually stalling to form an accretion shock at a radial distance of @xmath1  km from the center of the star .",
    "it is expected that the shock is revived within a second or so , enabling it to disrupt the star s outer layers and give rise to the supernova .",
    "the details of this shock revival is still uncertain , but recent progress has been made ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although a meager 1% of the gravitational energy released during collapse ( most of which is carried away by neutrinos ) is needed to account for the kinetic energy of the explosion , sophisticated spherically symmetric models fail to reproduce one of nature s most energetic events @xcite , except in the case of the lightest supernova progenitors with o - ne - mg cores @xcite .",
    "the solution to the core - collapse supernova problem will require multidimensional multiphysics simulations , including multi - frequency ( or multi - frequency _ and _ multi - angle ) neutrino transport , nuclear eoss and reaction networks , rotation , and ( magneto)hydrodynamic instabilities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "investigation of the role of magnetic fields in core - collapse supernovae began in the 1970s and 1980s @xcite .",
    "these studies seemed to show that both a strong magnetic field and rapid rotation were needed at the pre - collapse stage for the magnetic field to have any significant effect on the ensuing dynamics .",
    "the mechanisms responsible for magnetic field amplification in these studies were ( 1 ) compression during collapse , and ( 2 ) winding during the post - bounce phase .",
    "magnetic field enhancement through compression occurs because the stellar core may be regarded as a perfect electrical conductor ; hence the magnetic field is ` frozen - in ' to the fluid and the magnetic field strength grows with the mass density roughly as @xmath2 , resulting in a boost of three orders of magnitude due to a five orders of magnitude density increase during core collapse .",
    "differential rotation ",
    "an inevitable outcome of the collapse of a stellar core with any initial rotation  winds the magnetic field up , amplifying the azimuthal component linearly with time .",
    "the inefficiency of these classic mechanisms in producing dynamically significant magnetic fields from typical progenitor stars , expected to have modest initial rotation and field strength , is one reason magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) effects were not seriously reconsidered for almost two decades .",
    "while the relevance of magnetic fields to the supernova explosion mechanism remains unclear , the discovery of magnetars ( neutron stars with magnetic fields in the range @xmath3  g ) @xcite , the generically observed asphericity of core - collapse supernova explosions @xcite , the observation of collimated jets in supernovae associated with gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) @xcite , and the theoretical discovery of the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) @xcite have significantly increased recent interest in the role of magnetic fields in core - collapse supernovae @xcite .",
    "for example , the work of @xcite illustrates that a strong magnetic field , organized by rapid differential rotation into ` magnetic towers ' along the rotation axis , can drive bipolar explosions when the evolution is followed for several hundred milliseconds after bounce",
    ".    in particular , the mri , a weak - field instability , operates quite generically in differentially rotating fluids with a negative radial gradient in the angular velocity and may lead to exponential field growth on the rotation time scale .",
    "@xcite showed , in proof - of - principle calculations , that the mri may operate in the region between the proto - neutron star ( pns ) and the supernova shock to generate magnetic fields exceeding @xmath4  g within a few 100s of milliseconds .",
    "the extent of operation and ultimate impact of the mri are still uncertain , in large part due to the requirement of high spatial resolution to numerically resolve the mri : simple estimates suggest the wavelength of the fastest growing unstable mode to be roughly @xmath5  m ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and must be resolved by @xmath6 mesh points @xcite . @xcite",
    "employed simplified high resolution magnetorotational simulations of stellar collapse and observed episodes of exponential field growth due to the mri in localized regions shortly after bounce , but also found that the field generated by the mri had little influence on the growth of the global magnetic energy , which was dominated by the field generated by the winding mechanism .",
    "@xcite demonstrated , through what they coined semi - global simulations , that the mri may lead to dynamically significant magnetic fields in the supernova environment , but were unable to draw definitive conclusions on the magnetic field s impact on the global dynamics . despite existing uncertainties",
    ", it is frequently argued that the mri may operate efficiently in the post - bounce phase , and be responsible for generating the strong large - scale field that is needed to drive bipolar outflows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "while rotation was long assumed to be essential to the observed asphericity of supernova explosions ( perhaps in connection with magnetic fields ) , recent simulations of an idealized model constructed to mimic the stalled supernova shock wave have shown that the accretion shock is unstable to non - radial perturbations ( * ? ? ? * hereafter ) , and that this ` stationary accretion shock instability ' ( sasi ) may give rise to asymmetric explosion dynamics even without initial rotation .",
    "axisymmetric , two - dimensional ( 2d ) simulations show that the instability is dominated by @xmath7 ( dipole ) and @xmath8 ( quadrupole ) modes , leading to an asymmetric expansion of the supernova shock wave .",
    "three - dimensional ( 3d ) simulations of the same configuration ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ) show that the non - axisymmetric @xmath9 ( spiral ) mode may eventually dominate , and even result in significant spin - up of the pns .",
    "axisymmetric multiphysics supernova simulations have confirmed the existence of the sasi @xcite and underscored its importance : the sasi may improve the conditions for energy deposition by neutrinos in the post shock gas @xcite , and result in natal pulsar kicks that explain the velocity distribution of young pulsars @xcite .",
    "the fact that the sasi can generate phenomena previously attributed to progenitor rotation  in particular , asymmetric shock expansion and pulsar spin  raises the question of whether the sasi can also generate strong magnetic fields in the absence of initial rotation .",
    "the above - referenced mhd studies of stellar core collapse have taken rapid progenitor rotation for granted as a necessary ingredient , both as the energy source and mechanical agent of field amplification .",
    "the requirement of rapid rotation is an important constraint since the rotational free energy available in a millisecond pns is sufficient to account for the kinetic energy of the ` canonical ' supernova , but requires the magnetic field to grow strong enough to facilitate the conversion of rotational kinetic energy to kinetic energy of outward flow .",
    "however , an even smaller energy reservoir ( i.e. , that provided by the sasi , which may reach several @xmath10  erg ) may result in interesting and perhaps important , although less spectacular , mhd developments prior to the onset of explosion .",
    "in many of the past mhd studies the computational domain has been limited to one quadrant , and some of them have only been able to follow the simulations for a few 10s of milliseconds post - bounce , thereby excluding development of the sasi .",
    "most studies are also carried out with axial symmetry imposed . in this study",
    "we extend the models of and to include an initially weak magnetic field .",
    "we then perturb the stationary initial condition and study the evolution of the magnetic field as the sasi develops .",
    "we present results from axisymmetric 2d models , and non - rotating and slowly rotating 3d models .",
    "our simulations illustrate that sasi - induced flows may be able to significantly amplify the magnetic field beneath the shock , even in the absence of progenitor rotation .",
    "the amplification occurs on a time scale that is determined by the sasi - driven flows .",
    "the magnetic field in axisymmetric models is amplified by compression and stretching due to the flows driven by the @xmath7 ( sloshing ) mode .",
    "the magnetic field then becomes concentrated in the polar regions .",
    "away from the polar regions , turbulent flows stretch the magnetic field into thin flux tubes .",
    "all our 3d models eventually become dominated by the @xmath9 ( spiral ) mode . the focused , high - speed accretion flow associated with",
    "the sasi spiral mode drives turbulence beneath the shock , which amplifies the magnetic field through flux tube stretching and results in a highly intermittent flux rope structure .",
    "the amplification does not lead to dynamically significant magnetic fields in our simulations , but the magnetic energy growth is ultimately suppressed by ( numerical ) resistivity due to finite spatial resolution .",
    "we are therefore unable to make precise statements about the final strength of the magnetic field generated by the sasi , but our simulations suggest that sasi - generated magnetic fields are not likely to have a dynamical impact on global supernova dynamics .",
    "nevertheless , our results suggest a mechanism for pns magnetization that does not rely on progenitor rotation .",
    "in this section we describe our simplified mhd model of the post - bounce supernova environment , briefly describe our numerical scheme , and demonstrate that our code can maintain stationary unperturbed initial conditions .      in this study of magnetic field generation by the sasi we adopt an idealized description of the post - bounce supernova environment .",

    "this accretion rate is large enough to increase the mass of the central object considerably over the time scales considered in this study ( @xmath3630 percent in one second ) , but in order to construct a steady state for the unperturbed initial condition , and compare against it , we set the rate of mass change of the central object to @xmath37 in all the models presented here . the rankine - hugoniot conditions ( cf . * ? ? ? * ) determine the hydrodynamic state just inside the shock , and the bernoulli equation is solved for the fluid structure from the shock down to @xmath38 km , which serves as an inner ` cutout ' boundary of our grid , and may be loosely interpreted as the surface of the proto - neutron star ( pns ) .",

    "one - dimensional stellar evolution calculations indicate that the magnetic field at the onset of stellar core collapse may be dominated by the azimuthal component @xmath42 g , with a radial component about three orders of magnitude lower @xcite . in this study we will only consider models with a purely radial initial field , disregarding any initial azimuthal component . this choice is consistent with a steady - state initial condition , and in any case collapse will tend to drag any initial higher order multipole moments of the field ( e.g. , dipole , quadrupole , etc . ) into a more radial configuration .",
    "our rotating models are also initialized with a purely radial magnetic field , but the initial ( differential ) rotation profile quickly winds up the magnetic field and results in a configuration with a significant azimuthal magnetic field inside the shock . during collapse the magnetic field",

    "we run our models to an end time that is comparable to the time between bounce and shock revival in a core collapse supernova  about 1  s. thus , our code must be able to integrate the mhd equations accurately on this time scale . because the analytic initial condition is not an exact solution to the discretized mhd equations ,",

    "the change in angular velocity of the pns is inconsistent with the steady state assumption , but the inconsistency is of similar magnitude to that arising from ignoring the change in gravitational mass due to accretion .    the small amount of rotation results in a continuous generation of magnetic field due to winding .",
    "when the rotating model settles to a new equilibrium configuration there is a balance between magnetic energy generation from winding and loss due to advection through the inner boundary so that the total magnetic energy between the pns and the shock stays nearly constant .",

    "in all the axisymmetric  as well as some of the 3d  simulations examined in this section , the initial condition is perturbed by the introduction of two regions in the pre - shock flow , one in the northern hemisphere and one in the southern hemisphere , whose density is increased by 20% compared to the unperturbed model . in axisymmetry",
    "these overdense regions constitute rings of two different radii around the symmetry axis , but with the same circular cross section and placed at the same radial distance from the pns .",
    "we term this the ` axisymmetric perturbation ' .",
    "as was found by , relaxing the constraint imposed by axial symmetry allows for the development of the spiral sasi mode . to avoid favoring the @xmath7 sloshing mode ( which may occur when the axisymmetric perturbation is used to initiate the sasi in 3d models ) ,",

    "the two extremes of one such oscillation are pictured in the two upper panels of figure [ fig : magneticfieldoverview_medres_2d_b0_1e10_l0_0e00_perturbed ] , and the overall sloshing pattern is visibly traced by the alternating peaks in the dashed blue and dotted red curves in the right panel of figure [ fig : magneticandkineticenergy_medres_2d_b0_1e10_l0_0e00_perturbed ] representing the kinetic energy in cylinders extending above and below the pns , respectively .",
    "infalling matter strikes the shock at an oblique angle as a result of the displacement of the shock , and this introduces lateral flows inside the shocked cavity , whose share of kinetic energy steadily increases ( note the growing trend of the dot - dashed curve in the right panel of figure [ fig : magneticandkineticenergy_medres_2d_b0_1e10_l0_0e00_perturbed ] for @xmath139  ms ) .",
    "lateral flows alternating towards and away from the symmetry axis in the northern and southern hemisphere compress and expand the magnetic field the polar regions ; this results in a tendency for the maximum magnetic field to grow and decline alternately near the north and south poles , superimposed on a gradual trend of overall increase in magnetic field strength .",

    "as the sasi wave develops nonlinearly and the flows beneath the shock become nearly tangential to the shock surface an internal shock forms in the post - shock gas around 390  ms .",
    "the internal shock is connected to the accretion shock in a triple point , which is visible as a kink in the shock surface , located south of the equatorial region ( @xmath146 ) in the lower left panel of figure [ fig : magneticfieldoverview_medres_2d_b0_1e10_l0_0e00_perturbed ] .",
    "ahead of the internal shock , which is traveling latitudinally southward at @xmath147  ms , a fast stream of less - severly - shocked ( low - entropy ) material penetrates down towards the pns .",

    "the angular momentum reaches similar values in all models ( a few @xmath193 g @xmath117 s@xmath35 ) , which is sufficient to impact the rotation rate of the underlying pns .",
    "furthermore , magnetic energy growth also responds to the operation of the sasi spiral mode .",
    "the initiation of exponential magnetic energy growth coincides with the onset of the nonlinear sasi , when the kinetic energy beneath the shock starts to grow rapidly , but the magnetic energy continues to grow even when the kinetic energy begins to level off : there is a clear change in the kinetic energy growth rate around @xmath194  ms for model 3db12@xmath124rm ( blue line ) , while the magnetic energy continues to grow at a nearly unchanged rate beyond this point .",
    "a similar trend is also seen in model 3db12rm ( red line ) where the kinetic energy starts to level off around 700  ms while the magnetic energy growth rate is nearly unchanged beyond 800  ms . however , the magnetic energy levels off shortly thereafter .",
    "the magnetic energy is still growing in most models near the end of the simulation , but at a slower pace . from these calculations",
    "it does not seem plausible that the magnetic energy will attain significantly higher levels , at least on a time scale that is relevant for core - collapse supernovae .",
    "the non - rotating models with the random perturbation , as opposed to the reference model , show signs of both the sloshing and the spiral mode early on and the linear evolution resembles a superposition of these modes with comparable amplitudes , but the spiral mode dominates later in the transition to the nonlinear stage .",
    "@xcite pointed out a close relationship between these modes .",
    "we also observe that the rotating model ( 3db12@xmath124rm ) enters the nonlinear stage sooner , and then its magnetic energy grows somewhat faster than in the non - rotating models .",
    "the rotating model also develops more directly into one that exhibits a clear spiral mode pattern . during the simulation the rotating model s angular momentum stays roughly aligned with the original rotation axis ( to within an angle of @xmath195 rad ) , while the non - rotating models have angular momentum vectors that change direction in a seemingly random fashion .",
    "the fact that the model with initial field of @xmath145  g develops in a manner similar to the models with @xmath161  g ( i.e. , attains a similar relative boost in magnetic energy ) is an indication that the magnetic field has little effect on the nonlinear evolution of the sasi .",
    "it should be pointed out that model 3db12rm seems to go nonlinear somewhat later than model 3db10rm , which may indicate that the initial field strength has a minor effect on the linear development of the sasi .",
    "we have found through our numerical experiments that sasi - induced flows are capable of amplifying the magnetic field beneath the shock . in axisymmetric 2d models the sloshing mode results in a somewhat artificial accumulation of magnetic field along the symmetry axis .",
    "the spiral mode eventually dominates the fluid flows in 3d models and drives the amplification of the magnetic field .",
    "the kinetic energy of the flow , the immediate source of magnetic energy , becomes quite significant when the sasi is in the nonlinear stage . from figures [ fig : magneticandkineticenergy_medres_2d_b0_1e10_l0_0e00_perturbed ] and",
    "[ fig : magneticandkineticenergy_medres_3d_b0_1e12_l0_0e00_axisymmetricperturbation ] we can make the following preliminary observation : the kinetic energy reservoir beneath the shock is a few times @xmath190  b  several orders of magnitude above the levels reached by the magnetic energy at the end of the simulations .",
    "we now turn to explain how magnetic field amplification is realized in our models .",
    "the basic mechanism responsible for magnetic field growth near the symmetry axis , seen in the axisymmetric 2d models and ( initially ) in the 3d model with the axisymmetric perturbation , can be summarized in simple physical terms : there is a tendency for more magnetic field to be advected towards the axis than away from it , resulting in an overall accumulation of magnetic field in the polar regions .",
    "sasi - induced lateral flows towards the symmetry axis carry the radial component of the magnetic field along with them , and the associated magnetic flux conservation results in a stronger field as the fluid is compressed against the symmetry axis . under the constraint of axial symmetry , without a ( at least momentarily ) symmetry - breaking initiation of a toroidal flow ,",
    "the fluid arriving at the axis is forced to turn parallel to it ; therefore the field component parallel to the axis gets ` left behind ' at this point , deposited near the axis , because only the field component perpendicular to the flow suffers advection . upon encountering",
    "either the neutron star below or continuing infall from above , the fluid flows parallel to the axis must once again become lateral , now advecting magnetic field away from the axis . but to the extent flows impinging on the axis are preferentially diverted away from rather than towards the neutron star , the field advected away is of lesser strength than the field left behind .",
    "the phenomenon of near - axis field amplification is also easily understood mathematically in terms of faraday s law of induction , expressed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : induction ] ) for a perfectly conducting medium with electric field @xmath58 .",
    "the stationary unperturbed initial condition has vanishing electric field , but perturbations give rise to lateral components of both @xmath13 and @xmath15 , and while @xmath13 and @xmath15 remain poloidal , they are no longer strictly parallel ( or antiparallel ) .",
    "this results in a purely toroidal @xmath196 , whose nonvanishing curl around the symmetry axis implies changes to @xmath15 . in cylindrical coordinates",
    "@xmath197 , @xmath198 where @xmath199 near the axis @xmath200 , and while @xmath201 as well , @xmath202 remains finite .",

    "the magnetic energy growth seen in our 3d models is driven by the fluid motions from the sasi resulting in a net work done against the lorentz force .",
    "this is caused by stretching of the magnetic field : in all our 3d models we find that @xmath233 at late times during the operation of the sasi spiral mode . the spiral mode results in a persistent shear flow inside the supernova shock which extends from the shock triple point down towards the pns .",
    "the shearing region generates fluid vorticity , triggers secondary fluid instabilities ( e.g. , the kelvin - helmholtz instability ) , and results in a turbulent flow filling a significant fraction of the volume beneath the shock .",

    "our calculations therefore do not suggest that magnetic energy growth is quenched because the magnetic field establishes dynamical equipartition with the fluid on any spatial scale . on the other hand ,",

    "the 2d models are of course much less computionally intensive than the 3d models .",
    "while this allows us to explore a large range in spatial resolution , the obvious limitations of imposing axial symmetry makes it less interesting to pursue this path .",
    "we will focus mostly on the 3d models in this section .",

    "obviously , higher spatial resolution allows smaller structures to be captured by the numerical simulations .",

    "lower left panel of figure [ fig : varyingresolution3d_nopoyntingflux ] ) when the post shock flow rearranges itself after the breakup of axial symmetry .",
    "the shock volume shrinks dramatically when this occurs , and the average shock radius dips down to a minimum of about @xmath308  km for @xmath309  ms .",
    "the drop in the total magnetic energy between the shock and the pns is balanced by an increase in the poynting flux through the surface enclosing the pns .",
    "a clear spiral mode appears ( and persists until the end of the calculation ) when @xmath284 begins to grow again . at the end of the calculation",
    "most of the magnetic energy consists of magnetic fields with @xmath310  g ( @xmath311 ) .",
    "only a small fraction ( @xmath312 ) of the magnetic energy is due to magnetic fields exceeding @xmath156  g. note that this ` pausing phase ' seems to be an artifact of the applied perturbation , and results in a significant delay in magnetic energy growth .    despite the dramatic increase in magnetic energy with increasing resolution",
    ", the global characteristics of the flow interior to the shock remain unaffected by the magnetic field",
    ". the strength of the magnetic field generated by the sasi does not carry much physical meaning by itself ; in order to determine any influence of the magnetic field on the fluid , the magnetic energy must be compared locally with the kinetic energy and/or internal energy .",
    "the magnetic energy grows at the expense of the kinetic energy in the flow , and it is expected ( assuming that realistic magnetic reynolds numbers can be attained ) that the magnetic energy can grow until a dynamical equilibrium ( at least on some spatial scale ) is established .",
    "we investigate if this has occurred in figure [ fig : magneticenergydistribution_3d_highres ] in which we plot the distribution of the magnetic energy density in the volume between the pns and the shock ( black line ) at the end of model 3db12ah .",
    "we compare the magnetic energy to the kinetic energy by plotting the distribution of zones where the ratio of magnetic to kinetic energy @xmath313 @xmath314 is grater than or equal to @xmath315 ( red ) , @xmath190 ( green ) , @xmath316 ( blue ) , and @xmath81 ( magenta ) , respectively . at the end of this simulation",
    "we find that most of the magnetic energy ( @xmath317 ) is stored in zones where @xmath318 , while a progressively smaller fraction of the total magnetic energy is in zones where @xmath319 and @xmath320 ( @xmath321 and @xmath322 , respectively ) , and only about @xmath323 of the total magnetic energy is in zones where @xmath324 .",
    "the ratio of magnetic to internal energy remains even lower : less than @xmath189 of the magnetic energy is in zones where @xmath325 , while there are no zones with @xmath326 for @xmath267  ms .",
    "thus , it does not seem plausible that magnetic energy growth is curbed by an established dynamical equilibrium .",
    "the bulk of the magnetic energy quickly becomes concentrated on the smallest available spatial scale ( determined by the spatial resolution ) , and the magnetic field can not be further strengthened through stretching .",
    "numerical diffusion is therefore , in effect , limiting further growth of the magnetic energy .",
    "the growth of the magnetic energy has not converged in the range of spatial resolutions covered by the 3d simulations presented in this section .",
    "however , it is evident that simulations with high spatial resolution ( even higher than we can afford in this study ) are necessary in order to evolve the magnetic field as it is stretched to smaller and smaller scales in the turbulent flow beneath the shock . for a flux tube with thickness",
    "@xmath327 we expect from flux conservation during stretching that @xmath328 for the 2d models , and @xmath329 for the 3d models .",
    "this expectation agrees well with figure [ fig : rmsfieldvsrmsscale ] in which we plot the time - averaged rms magnetic field @xmath330 versus the time - averaged magnetic rms scale @xmath331 ( i.e. , flux tube thickness ) for the 2d and the 3d models presented in this section .",
    "moreover , the limitations of axisymmetric calculations become evident : the steeper slope displayed by the 3d results underscores the importance of evolving the supernova magnetic field with 3d simulations . according to this stretching relationship , an average flux rope thickness of @xmath332  km implies @xmath333  g , for models with @xmath161  g , while a similar rms magnetic field for models with @xmath45  g requires @xmath334  m !",
    "our results suggest that the strength of the magnetic fields generated by the sasi in core - collapse supernovae can attain levels similar to ( or even significantly higher than ) those attained in the simulations presented here ; although the exact values depend on the initial ( progenitor ) magnetic field , and the spatial scale at which a presumed dynamical equilibrium between the fluid and the magnetic field is established . on the other hand ,",
    "the kinetic energy available from the sasi - driven turbulent flow , and hence the magnetic energy that can be generated by the sasi is likely too low for sasi - generated magnetic fields to have any significant impact on the global dynamics leading to the majority of core - collapse supernovae  i.e .",
    ", those originating from non - rotating or slowly rotating progenitors @xcite .",
    "the poynting flux through the inner boundary of our simulation implies neutron star magnetization .",
    "the pns is excised from our computational domain , but we can estimate the rms magnetic field in the volume it occupies  and therefore the magnetic field strength of the nascent neutron star due to the flux of electromagnetic energy through our inner ( ` cutout ' ) boundary .    when the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : poyntingtheorem ] ) is neglected ( and @xmath216 ) , an integral over the volume @xmath335 occupied by the pns gives the rate of accumulation of magnetic energy @xmath85 in terms of the poynting flux through the pns surface @xmath336 .",
    "in particular @xmath337 where @xmath338 from our highest resolution 3d simulation ( 3db12ah ) we find that @xmath85 reaches almost @xmath315  b by the end of the calculation . thus the pns is expected to be significantly magnetized ( @xmath339  g ) from the accreted field generated by the sasi model .",
    "this expectation is of course sensitive to the initial magnetic field and the duration of sasi operation .",
    "thus an observed pulsar magnetic field strength , in conjunction with knowledge of the delay to explosion ( and therefore duration of the sasi ) obtained from neutrino or gravitational wave signals , might even provide information on the initial magnetic field strength .",
    "this estimate directs attention to the fact that excision of the pns prohibits treatment of some issues that may be worthy of further study . for instance , our neglect of the maxwell stress in estimating the neutron star magnetization @xmath340 corresponds to the fact that excision of the pns prohibits meaningful treatment of the ` back - reaction ' of pns magnetization on fluid flows and magnetic field evolution in the computational domain .",
    "in addition the sasi - generated magnetic field may also provide a significant input field to be further amplified by the convective dynamo that potentially operates inside the pns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we have presented 2d ( axisymmetric ) and 3d simulations of an idealized mhd model of a stalled supernova shock , which demonstrate that sasi - driven flows  initiated from non - rotating or slowly rotating progenitors  are able to significantly amplify the magnetic field beneath the shock .",
    "an almost four orders of magnitude increase in magnetic energy is observed in the highest resolution 3d model .",
    "the amplification does not result in magnetic fields that have any direct impact on global features of the shock evolution in our models , but the final magnetic energy and field strength remain sensitive to the spatial resolution in our numerical simulations .",
    "the magnetic field evolves in a turbulent flow , and develops into a highly intermittent ` flux rope ' structure .",
    "the average ` flux rope ' thickness is limited by finite spatial resolution , being resolved by only a few computational cells , and numerical dissipation suppresses further growth of the magnetic energy ( with @xmath341 ; cf .",
    "( [ eq : poyntingtheorem ] ) ) .    the early evolution in axisymmetric models , and in axisymmetrically perturbed 3d models , is characterized by continued focusing of fluid flows toward the polar axes due to the sasi sloshing mode . as flows directed toward the axis",
    "are forced to turn parallel to it , the magnetic field is advected into the polar regions , ` combed ' parallel to the polar axes by the fluid flow , and left behind .",
    "relatively modest initial oscillations in the magnetic field strength are followed by an epoch of exponential field growth with the emergence of the sasi - induced internal shock and its associated streams ( or sheets , in axisymmetry ) plunging toward the pns and the symmetry axis .",
    "the 2d models evolve to an end state where the bulk of the magnetic energy is concentrated around the imposed axis of symmetry .",
    "the amplification is due to compression _ and _ stretching in 2d models .",
    "non - axisymmetric flows ( i.e. , the sasi spiral mode ) emerge and become dominant in all the 3d models .",
    "these flows quickly destabilize and disperse the magnetic structure generated by the axisymmetric sasi ( cf .",
    "model 3db12am ) , demonstrating the need for 3d simulations to avoid spurious relics of axisymmetry on the magnetic field evolution .",
    "the importance of doing 3d calculations is further underscored by the dominance of the inherently non - axisymmetric sasi spiral mode , and by the obvious geometrical limitation on magnetic field amplification by stretching when axisymmetry is imposed ( stretching of sheets vs. stretching of tubes ; cf . figure [ fig : rmsfieldvsrmsscale ] ) .",
    "magnetic field stretching , facilitated by the turbulent flows driven by the sasi spiral mode , plays the dominant role in amplifying the magnetic field in the 3d models .",
    "the development of turbulence beneath the shock is associated with the plunging supersonic stream emanating from the shock triple point .",
    "these nonlinear flows develop from the accompanying shear and stagnation regions , and spread during the operation of the sasi spiral mode to fill a large volume beneath the shock .",
    "the magnetic field amplification is not driven directly by this shear flow , but rather indirectly by the hydrodynamical consequences of the presence of the plunging stream , which drives a turbulent flow beneath the shock .",
    "there is , of course , some magnetic field amplification occurring in the shear layer as well , but the magnetized fluid elements spend a relatively short time in this region compared to the time they spend ` churning ' in the vigorous turbulence driven by the sasi .",
    "the growth of magnetic energy in our numerical simulations eventually becomes limited by numerical resistivity because of the magnetic field s tendency to evolve into thin flux ropes .",
    "( numerical resistivity inevitably becomes important when the magnetic field varies significantly over only a few grid zones . )",
    "this is , of course , a nonphysical effect in our simulations since the fluid between the pns and the shock is expected to behave as a nearly perfect electrical conductor .",
    "we are therefore unable to make exact predictions about the magnetic field in a presumed saturated state , but it is reasonable to expect that the magnetic field may eventually become dynamically significant , at least on relatively small spatial scales , where the drag of the fluid on the flux ropes is balanced by the tension of the flux ropes ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the turbulent kinetic energy available on the scales where the magnetic field may become dynamically important will determine its final state and ultimate impact on the dynamics .",
    "in fact , a sizable fraction of the kinetic energy beneath the shock is due to chaotic motions , but we do not expect this to be sufficient for sasi - generated magnetic fields to become important to global dynamics of core - collapse supernovae emanating from non - rotating or slowly rotating progenitors .",
    "a more detailed analysis is required to investigate the issues related to magnetic field saturation in further detail , including a fourier spectral decomposition of the magnetic and kinetic energies .",
    "such an analysis is beyond the scope of this initial paper , but we plan to include it in a forthcoming study",
    ".    given infinite spatial resolution , the magnetic energy in our models is still limited by the kinetic energy of the sasi - driven post - shock flows , which is a few @xmath342  b. the rotational energy associated with the spin - up of the pns ( cf .",
    "eq ( [ eq : omegadot ] ) ) is of similar magnitude , and not sufficient to produce mhd - driven outflows .",
    "a larger energy reservoir  e.g .",
    ", a rotational energy reservoir provided by relic angular momentum from progenitor rotation  appears to be needed for mhd effects to play a principal role in driving the explosion .",
    "the simulations presented in this study do not produce sufficient rotational energies .",
    "the rotational energy , @xmath343 , of a nascent neutron star with a rotation period of a few milliseconds is in the range of @xmath344  b ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the free energy available due to differential rotation is about 10% of @xmath343 @xcite . @xcite estimate free energies exceeding 3  b for their fastest spinning models , which are capable of driving outflows .",
    "however , such rapidly rotating pnss are not predicted by current stellar evolution theory ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and mhd - driven explosions are therefore likely to be limited to a only small subset of progenitor stars .    indeed , past studies have concluded that rotation is needed both as the energy reservoir _ and _ for amplification of the post - bounce magnetic field . in particular",
    ", the conventional wisdom has been that rapid rotation is needed to amplify the magnetic field to dynamical significance _ before _ any rotational energy can be magnetically tapped to drive outflows . both field line wrapping and the mri require differential rotation and result in field amplification on the rotation time scale .",
    "the mri , hailed as the most promising amplification mechanism , may lead to exponential field growth in the differentially rotating fluid between the pns and the supernova shock , and perhaps result in magnetorotationally - driven outflows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the lack of sufficient rotation ( and also spatial resolution ) in our models excludes the development of the mri , but an interesting question for future work is whether the sasi may ( perhaps in conjunction with the mri ) generate the magnetic fields required to extract rotational energy from the pns and result in important dynamical effects  in particular , for moderately - rotating progenitor stars .",
    "moderate rotation alone may not be able to rapidly generate a strong magnetic field ; but if a sufficiently strong magnetic field can develop through the mechanisms discussed in this paper , the ( ` modest ' ) rotational energy available to be harnessed by that field still might be significant enough to impact pre - explosion dynamics .",
    "in other words , the sasi may be able to extend the range of progenitors  that is , range of rotation rates  for which magnetic fields play a role in their explosion dynamics .",
    "even if these magnetic fields turn out not to be important to the explosion , then perhaps they may impact the proto - neutron star wind that follows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the impact of magnetic fields in core collapse supernovae must ultimately be investigated in sophisticated supernova models with neutrino transport and a nuclear equation of state , across the range of progenitors predicted by stellar evolution theory , but our models offer proof of principle that magnetic fields may be significantly amplified post bounce without initial core rotation , contrary to conclusions reached in past core collapse supernova simulations that included mhd ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although our calculations result in magnetic fields that may not play a direct dynamical role in the explosion itself , they do suggest interesting implications for neutron star magnetization .",
    "the rotational energy available from the spin - up of the pns might account for a strongly magnetized neutron star ; but the turbulent kinetic energy spawned by the sasi is of comparable magnitude , and our simulations suggest that it may be tapped to create strongly magnetized neutron stars even from _ non - rotating _ progenitors .",
    "the sasi generates magnetic fields in a large volume outside the pns that is accreted as long as the sasi persists . because the strength of the generated field also depends on the initial field strength , an observed pulsar magnetic field strength , in conjunction with knowledge of the delay to explosion ( and therefore duration of the sasi ) obtained from neutrino or gravitational wave signals ,",
    "might even provide information on the initial ( progenitor ) magnetic field strength .",
    "in addition , further amplification may be attained through field line wrapping , and perhaps the mri , in the differentially rotating region extending from the pns , and also due to the convective dynamo that potentially operates inside the pns .",
    "our model excludes the region occupied by the pns , where these processes take place , but it is entirely plausible that the magnetic field generated in our models can be further amplified due to activities occurring closer to , or inside , the pns .",
    "our calculations also demonstrate the computational difficulty of capturing mhd effects in the large scale simulations that are needed to ultimately assess the role of magnetic fields in core collapse supernovae , namely the need for high spatial resolution in localized regions . in the context of the mri",
    "the wavelength of the fastest - growing unstable mode ( proportional to the magnetic field strength ) becomes prohibitively short when considering the field strengths predicted by stellar evolution calculations .",
    "sasi - induced magnetic fields are also limited by spatial resolution because the thickness of magnetic flux ropes , which harbor the strongest magnetic fields , are currently impossible to resolve properly in global multiphysics calculations .",
    "furthermore , the ubiquitous development ( and perhaps importance ) of turbulent flows poses additional challenges by itself : shock - capturing methods ( similar to the method employed in our calculations to evolve the mhd equations ) are inherently diffusive for turbulence , while methods commonly used in the study of turbulence are less effective in capturing discontinuities in the flow .",
