    "recent numerical findings have challenged the sustainability of hydromagnetic turbulence driven by the magneto rotational instability ( mri , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and hence the viability of the approach to provide the turbulent viscosity needed to explain accretion luminosities @xcite .",
    "the fundamental mechanism of the mri relies on the interplay between the epicyclic and magnetic restoring forces .",
    "coherent _ magnetic field acts as the mediator to extract free energy from the keplerian rotation . unless maintained by an external source or a helical dynamo , such a coherent field is , however , prone to dissipation by the turbulence created via parasitic instabilities",
    "this becomes apparent when looking at the most simplified case :    @xcite have analysed the results of a set of unstratified local mri simulations .",
    "the scaling law they derive predicts turbulent stresses based on several input parameters . for the case without vertical net - flux , they conclude that simulation results should depend linearly on the numerical resolution . have independently confirmed this prediction and show that transport coefficients do not converge with increasing resolution .",
    "this finding of vanishing turbulent stresses @xmath1 for zero net flux ( znf ) is in contrast to the case of a net vertical flux ( nvf ) , which continuously drives long - wavelength mri modes ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and for which convergence has been obtained @xcite .    attribute the lack of convergence to a resolution - dependent effective prandtl number @xmath2 of their code . in a subsequent paper , show that convergence can be recaptured if explicit dissipation with @xmath3 is included . for smaller values of @xmath4 , the lack of convergence may be attributed to the fact that a small - scale dynamo becomes much harder to excite @xcite .",
    "an alternative interpretation has been put forward by @xcite , who relate the convergence issue to the problem of resolving radial structures occurring for non - axis symmetric mri modes .    but how realistic are such local models ?",
    "@xcite has recently pointed out that unstratified local simulations do not provide a ( physically relevant ) outer scale for the turbulence , and therefore the observed @xmath4 dependence might be an artifact of the local approximation .    @xcite indeed report characteristic differences in magnetic power spectra for vnf and znf simulations , illustrating the lack of a well - defined injection scale in the latter case . since the eddy viscosity is determined by the outer scale ,",
    "this is sufficient to explain the convergence in @xmath1 for ideal mhd .",
    "note that @xcite , however , found a strong trend towards weaker turbulence for smaller explicit @xmath4 in unstratified nvf simulations .",
    "regardless of the @xmath4 dependence , coherent field structures appear to be the prerequisite for driving significant accretion stresses .",
    "moreover , large - scale fields may even contribute to the accretion stresses directly . in the absence of external fields ,",
    "a mean - field dynamo can provide a means to replenish coherent fields that in turn drive mri .",
    "this idea has first been advocated by @xcite .",
    "such an effect is likely beneficial to sustain mri turbulence , possibly even at @xmath5 as the excitation conditions of large - scale dynamos are known to be independent of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "in fact , @xcite have very recently shown that stratification provides a sufficient condition for convergence in the znf case and attribute this to a dynamo - generated mean azimuthal field ( also cf . * ? ? ?",
    "if this is the case , the saturation amplitude of @xmath1 should depend on the quenched state of the underlying dynamo .    along these lines",
    ", it becomes mandatory to better understand how accretion discs can maintain coherent fields  overcoming both turbulent dissipation and buoyant field expulsion . as advocated in @xcite , understanding the non - linear saturation of mri in a realistic scenario will require to couple a closure model for turbulent stresses with mean - field dynamo theory .",
    "as for the former , approaches beyond a simple shakura - sunyaev viscosity include phenomenological closures by @xcite ( znf ) , @xcite ( vnf ) , and @xcite .",
    "the applicability of these models has , of course , to be checked by comparison with sets of numerical simulations @xcite . combining such closures with (",
    "dynamically quenched ) mean - field dynamo models will ultimately allow to develop a consistent sub - grid scale framework , potentially enabling global large - eddy simulations of ionised accretion discs .    in the following , we aim to demonstrate that there exist helicity - based dynamo mechanisms in stratified mri simulations which are consistent with the observed rising field structures .",

    "one argument in favour of periodic boundaries is that they conserve the azimuthal and radial flux and therefore do not `` pollute '' the dynamo - generated field via an inward poynting flux @xmath16 .",
    "we have checked that for @xmath17 , the dominant contribution is from the advective term , and thus the net poynting flux is directed outwards . to compensate for the mass loss through the open boundaries and provide a stationary background with respect to the hydrostatic equilibrium",

    "one is tempted to identify the cycle from the blue and yellow lines , but this is misleading . when looking at a slice at constant time @xmath18 , these pronounced streaks partly exhibit a bipolar structure in the _ vertical _ direction rather than a cyclic behaviour in time . at a given time , these streaks are somewhat reminiscent of mri channel modes .",

    "currently , there exist two scenarios which try to explain these characteristic field patterns : on the one hand , it has been speculated that the origin of these upward motions is buoyant rise due to parker - unstable toroidal fields ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "alternatively , @xcite have suggested the presence of an @xmath21  type mean - field dynamo , which can produce patterns that travel away from the midplane if the @xmath22 component of the dynamo tensor is negative .    in a recent analysis , @xcite",
    "show that , several scale heights @xmath0 away from the midplane , the undulatory parker instability is responsible for the upward magnetic motions . near the midplane",
    ", however , they find the flow to be buoyantly stable .    in the subsequent analysis",

    "this does , however , not seem to have an effect on horizontally averaged quantities .    since @xmath40 is dominated by stretching of the radial field via the shear term , we focus on the reconstruction of @xmath38 , where only the first two terms in eq .",

    "the resulting grooves are again reminiscent of mri channel modes  which are in fact valid solutions to the 1d mean - field equation . in this respect ,",
    "the scale separation is blurred as one would naturally attribute such a small - scale effect to the fluctuating field .",
    "in the following , we set out to describe the cyclic behaviour in a more generalised way , i.e. , without a need for the time - dependent electromotive forces from the direct simulations .",

    "such an effect has first been predicted by @xcite and was derived formally by . while the former effect ( with positive @xmath59 ) is presumably dominant in the parker - unstable halo , the latter ( with negative @xmath59 ) is likely to operate close to the disc midplane .",
    "moreover , there is a remarkable resemblance to recent results by , who found a similar interplay between the parker instability and mri for magnetically dominated accretion discs .",
    "our results similarly suggest to take up the ideas of a self - regulatory dynamo cycle as proposed by @xcite almost two decades ago .    whether this scenario is real , has to be checked by future studies .",
