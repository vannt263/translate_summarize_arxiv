    "the higgs mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking and generation of fermion masses remains the last untested component of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the discovery of the physical higgs boson that accompanies this mechanism , or its refutation through the discovery of alternative dynamics underlying electroweak symmetry breaking , is the primary goal of the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "the sm higgs mechanism predicts the couplings of the higgs boson to pairs of sm particles in terms of the known particle masses . in extensions of the sm higgs sector ,",
    "these couplings are typically modified , with the pattern of modifications providing valuable information that can shed light on the structure of the extended model .",
    "a key test of the sm higgs mechanism thus involves measurement of as many higgs couplings as possible .",
    "high - precision , model - independent measurements of higgs couplings are a major component of the physics case for the international linear @xmath5 collider ( ilc )  @xcite .",
    "key to the model - independence of these measurements is the ability to measure the total production cross section for @xmath6 using the recoil - mass technique  @xcite .",
    "this technique requires event - by - event knowledge of the four - momentum of the initial state ( without using measurements of the higgs decay products ) , and is thus unavailable at the lhc .",
    "instead , extraction of higgs couplings from future lhc measurements of higgs production and decay rates requires making a model - dependent assumption , either about the possible higgs decay modes or about some of the higgs couplings .",
    "the difficulty arises due to a genuine flat direction in the coupling fit corresponding to allowing an unobserved higgs decay mode while simultaneously increasing all the production and decay couplings by a common factor .",
    "the higgs signal rate in production channel @xmath7 and decay channel @xmath8 is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the cross section for production channel @xmath7 , br@xmath11 is the higgs branching ratio into final state @xmath8 , @xmath12 is the higgs partial width into final state @xmath8 , and @xmath13 is the higgs total width . adding a new , unobserved higgs decay channel with partial width @xmath14 while simultaneously increasing all the higgs couplings by a common factor @xmath15 relative to their sm values yields @xmath16 for any given value of @xmath14 , an appropriate choice of @xmath15 yields higgs signal rates identical to those in the sm .",
    "previous studies of higgs coupling extraction from lhc data have dealt with this flat direction either by assuming that no unexpected higgs decay channels exist  @xcite , or by assuming that the higgs couplings to @xmath2 and @xmath3 are bounded from above by their sm value  @xcite .",
    "doublets and singlets .",
    "viable models in which it is violated include the georgi - machacek model with su(2)@xmath17-triplet higgses  @xcite and the lee - wick standard model  @xcite which solves the hierarchy problem by implementing pauli - villars regularization with physical fields  @xcite .",
    "the potential enhancements of the higgs couplings to @xmath2 and @xmath3 above their sm values in these models have been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , respectively . ]",
    "these analyses have focused on higgs masses between 100 and 190  gev where many different higgs production and decay modes are experimentally accessible .",
    "depending on the higgs mass , they have shown that lhc measurements will provide sensitivity to the higgs couplings to @xmath18 and @xmath19 pairs , top and bottom quarks , and tau leptons , as well as to potential new loop contributions to the higgs couplings to photon and gluon pairs .",
    "theoretical and systematic uncertainties play an important role in the fits  @xcite , and in general the extracted coupling values are correlated with one another  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose a method by which the model dependence can be removed from higgs coupling measurements at the lhc . when the total width of the higgs is above about a gev , it can be measured directly using the lineshape of the four - lepton invariant mass distribution in @xmath0 , where @xmath20 ,  @xmath21 .",
    "this occurs in the sm for higgs masses above about 190  gev .",
    "lineshape are disfavored in the context of the sm .",
    "however , in extended models , higgs masses above 190  gev are fully consistent with electroweak precision measurements ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for an extensive review .",
    "therefore , if such a heavy higgs boson is discovered , the electroweak fit provides strong motivation to search for new physics effects , including shifts in the higgs couplings relative to the sm expectations .",
    "] such a measurement directly determines the denominator in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : rate1 ] ) and ( [ eq : rate2 ] ) , removing the degeneracy in the fit without imposing any model assumptions .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : param ] we describe our parameterization of possible new physics in the higgs couplings . in sec .",
    "[ sec : observables ] we list the higgs observables that we use in the fit and describe the fitting procedure . for a higgs mass of 190  gev ,",
    "current lhc studies indicate that the only observable sm higgs production modes will be gluon fusion and vector boson fusion and the only observable sm decays will be to @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "our fit is thus sensitive only to the higgs couplings to @xmath2 and @xmath3 , to the effective higgs coupling to two gluons , and to a possible new component of the higgs total width . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we present the results of our fits as chi - squared contours in two - dimensional projections of our parameter space , as well as giving 1- and 2-sigma constraints on the couplings , assuming the best - fit point is at their sm values . in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we discuss our results and conclude .",
    "a sm higgs boson with mass 190  gev decays 78.70% of the time to @xmath22 and 20.77% to @xmath3 , with the remaining 0.53% of decays mainly to @xmath23 and @xmath4 , leading to a total width of 1.036  gev ( computed using the public fortran code hdecay  @xcite ) .",
    "the largest production cross sections for such a higgs boson at the lhc are gluon fusion ( @xmath24 ) and vector boson fusion ( vbf @xmath25 ) . at this mass",
    ", lhc measurements will provide access to the higgs total width through the @xmath26 lineshape , as well as event rates in four primary higgs production and decay channels : @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",
    "lhc measurements can thus provide sensitivity to the higgs couplings to @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( through higgs decays to these final states and through production via vector boson fusion ) , the effective coupling to @xmath4 ( through production via gluon fusion ) , and potential new contributions to the higgs total width ( directly through the @xmath0 lineshape as well as indirectly through the higgs branching ratios to @xmath2 and @xmath3 final states ) .",
    "we parameterize shifts in these three couplings in terms of three multiplicative factors , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , which are all equal to @xmath34 in the sm .",
    "we parameterize shifts in the higgs total width in terms of a new , unobserved contribution to the width , @xmath14 , which is zero in the sm . in terms of these parameters ,",
    "the higgs partial and total widths and production cross sections are given as follows ( we neglect sm contributions to @xmath13 other than @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) : @xmath35 \\sigma^{\\rm sm}({\\rm vbf } \\to h ) .",
    "\\label{eq : params}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    two comments are in order .",
    "first , vector boson fusion proceeds through diagrams involving either @xmath18 or @xmath19 exchange in the @xmath36-channel .",
    "if we take @xmath37 as predicted in most extended higgs models , then the cross section for vector boson fusion is given simply by @xmath38 .",
    "if , however , we want to fit separately for @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( which are unequal , for example , in the georgi - machacek model  @xcite with custodial su(2 ) violation in the higgs mixing  @xcite ) , we must express the vector boson fusion cross section in terms of the separate contributions of the @xmath18 and @xmath19 exchange diagrams .",
    "these diagrams do interfere , e.g. , in @xmath41 ; however , the interference is negligible as can be understood by examining the kinematics of the @xmath18 and @xmath19 exchange diagrams : in @xmath18 exchange the final - state @xmath42 quark is produced primarily in the same direction as the initial @xmath43 quark , while in @xmath19 exchange it is produced primarily in the opposite direction .",
    "we have checked this numerically using the public code madgraph  @xcite by computing the tree - level cross section for @xmath44 and comparing it to the sum of the cross section including only @xmath18 exchange and the cross section including only @xmath19 exchange . from this calculation",
    "we obtain the factors of @xmath45 and @xmath46 for the @xmath18 and @xmath19 fractions of the vector boson fusion cross section quoted in the last line of eq .",
    "( [ eq : params ] ) .",
    "second , the lhc measurements that we consider do not provide access to higgs couplings to fermions .",
    "the cross section for @xmath24 is sensitive to the higgs coupling to the top quark , which dominates the one - loop gluon fusion process in the sm ; however , new colored particles running in the loop can also affect @xmath24 and their effects can not be disentangled from a shift in the higgs coupling to the top quark based on this single measurement . a large enhancement of the higgs coupling to bottom quarks can lead to a non - negligible branching fraction for @xmath47 ;",
    "we capture this possibility here only in @xmath14 . a large enhancement of the higgs coupling to bottom quarks can also affect the @xmath24 cross section through the contribution of the bottom quark in the loop .",
    "in this case , tree - level higgs production through @xmath48 can also become a significant contributor to the inclusive higgs production cross section , so that the value of @xmath49 extracted through our fit will be contaminated with this additional production mode .",
    "searching for @xmath50 production with an extra tagged @xmath51 quark in the final state could help pin down this scenario .",
    "we do not pursue this possibility further here .",
    "starting from the sm prediction for the event rate in each channel and the higgs total width , the parameterization in eq .",
    "( [ eq : params ] ) lets us recompute these rates and total width for any point in the four - dimensional parameter space of @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath49 , and @xmath14 . by comparing these model predictions to the expected experimental precision on the observables",
    ", we will determine the precision with which the four parameters can be measured .",
    "we now describe the observables used in our fit and the fitting procedure .",
    "our fit involves seven observables , comprising the higgs total width and event rates in six production and decay channels .",
    "our observables are each normalized to the corresponding sm expectation , so that in the sm their values are equal to 1 .",
    "we take the expected experimental uncertainties on these observables from the literature .",
    "these expected uncertainties have been evaluated for 30  fb@xmath1 of integrated luminosity at one detector at the 14  tev center - of - mass energy lhc , and include statistical uncertainties only .",
    "we do not attempt to incorporate systematic uncertainties in the fit .",
    "our first observable is the higgs total width , @xmath52 extraction of the higgs total width from the @xmath26 lineshape has been studied most thoroughly by cms  @xcite . for an integrated luminosity of 30  fb@xmath1 , cms finds a statistical uncertainty on @xmath13 of 17.6% for @xmath53  gev ( see sec .",
    "10.2.1.7 of ref .",
    "because this uncertainty comes solely from the statistical precision in measuring the gaussian width of the higgs lineshape , it scales in the usual way as @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the integrated luminosity .",
    "the uncertainty in the intrinsic @xmath56 invariant mass resolution will enter as a systematic uncertainty , but has not been included in the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "our next five observables are higgs signal event rates studied for atlas in ref .",
    "these comprise signal rates for higgs production via gluon fusion and vector boson fusion , with decays to @xmath2 and @xmath3 final states ( the vector boson fusion channel with decays to @xmath2 is divided into two channels , one with @xmath57 in the final state and the other with @xmath58 or @xmath59 ) . because the signal and background selections in ref .",
    "@xcite were done specifically for the purpose of higgs coupling extraction , the author took care to account for the `` contamination '' of the signal in one production mode by higgs production via the other production mode : for example , the event selections for higgs production via gluon fusion contain some events in which the higgs is produced by vector boson fusion , and vice versa .",

    "@xcite are summarized in table  [ tab : rates ] .",

    "the statistical uncertainty on the signal rate is given by @xmath67 .",

    "the production cross section and higgs total width cancel , leaving the ratio of the partial widths of @xmath71 and @xmath72 , each of which is proportional to the square of the respective coupling . in particular",
    ", for higgs production via gluon fusion we can take the ratio of @xmath60 and @xmath61 , while for higgs production via vector boson fusion we can take the ratio of @xmath62 and a combination of @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath73 . propagating the uncertainties in the usual way",
    ", we find an uncertainty on @xmath70 of about 14% with 30  fb@xmath1 and 7.8% with 100  fb@xmath1 , very consistent with the results of the @xmath74 scan .",
    "this ratio method is inexact due to the fact that the channels with different final states have different amounts of `` contamination '' of the desired production mode by the other production mode ; i.e. , @xmath75 and @xmath76 are different for the @xmath77 in the numerator and the denominator , so that the parameter dependence in the production cross sections does not cancel perfectly .",
    "in this paper we showed that truly model - independent higgs coupling measurements can be made at the lhc when the higgs total width is experimentally accessible . for a sm - like higgs ,",
    "this occurs for @xmath78  gev . at such high masses , however , the only accessible higgs decay modes in the sm are to @xmath2 and @xmath3 , with production via gluon fusion or vector boson fusion .",
    "thus the lhc measurements provide access to the higgs couplings to @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the effective coupling to gluons , and any new contribution to the higgs total width beyond the decay widths to @xmath2 and @xmath3 .    using existing lhc studies for a higgs mass of 190  gev at 14  tev center - of - mass energy and considering only statistical uncertainties",
    ", we found that with 30  fb@xmath1 at one detector the higgs coupling - squared to vector bosons ( assuming the ratio of @xmath2 and @xmath3 couplings is equal to its sm value ) can be measured with an uncertainty of about 8.5% , the higgs effective coupling - squared to gluons can be measured with an uncertainty of about 11% , and a new , non - sm component of the higgs total width can be constrained at the 2@xmath79 level to be below about 22% of the sm higgs total width at this mass .",
    "with 100  fb@xmath1 at one detector the coupling - squared uncertainties decrease to about 4.6% and 5.8% , respectively , and the 2@xmath79 upper limit on a new contribution to the higgs total width decreases to about 12% of the sm higgs total width . at this level of precision",
    "we expect that systematic uncertainties will be important .    to give a sense of the usefulness of our constraint on a new contribution to the higgs total width , consider higgs decays to invisible final states such as dark matter particles .",
    "atlas has studied the sensitivity to invisible higgs decays in vector boson fusion with 30  fb@xmath1 at 14  tev . for @xmath53",
    "gev they find a 95% confidence level sensitivity to @xmath80 \\times { \\rm br}(h \\to { \\rm invis.})$ ] of about 15% not including systematic uncertainties , which rises to 60% including systematics  @xcite .",
    "their dominant systematic uncertainty comes from the 10% background normalization uncertainty due to the theoretical uncertainty in the shape of the angular distribution of the two jets in the dominant @xmath81 and @xmath82 backgrounds ; using a next - to - leading order calculation for @xmath81 and @xmath82 should reduce this by a factor of two , improving the 95% confidence level sensitivity to @xmath83 to roughly 40% . for sm - like higgs couplings to @xmath2 and @xmath3 ,",
    "this more optimistic limit corresponds to a new invisible component of the higgs total width of @xmath84 , which should be easily detectable ( but not identifiable as an invisible decay ) using our methods .",
    "how do our results compare with those achievable at the ilc ?",
    "results of multiple ilc higgs coupling studies at a variety of higgs masses are summarized in ref .",
    "@xcite , which incorporates results for @xmath5 center - of - mass energies of 350800  gev and integrated luminosities of 5001000  fb@xmath1 . while @xmath53  gev was not explicitly studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , we can obtain coupling uncertainties for this mass from fig .",
    "5 of ref .",

    "we read off an ilc uncertainty on @xmath39 of about 3% , to be compared with our lhc statistical precision of 8.5% ( 4.6% ) with 30  fb@xmath1 ( 100  fb@xmath1 ) .",
    "ilc has no access to @xmath49 for this higgs mass due to the extreme suppression of the @xmath85 branching fraction .",
    "the direct ilc measurement of the higgs total width from the @xmath26 lineshape is limited by statistics .",

    ", however , are the complementary ilc measurements of the higgs couplings to @xmath23 and @xmath88 that can not be measured at the lhc for the relatively high higgs mass considered here . despite the very small branching fraction of @xmath47 at @xmath53  gev ,",
    "@xmath89 can be measured to about 14% precision at the ilc  @xcite , where @xmath90 is a multiplicative factor parameterizing the shift in the @xmath91 coupling from its sm value .",

    "combining this measurement of @xmath93 with the lhc measurement of @xmath49 allows one to probe contributions to the effective @xmath94 coupling due to particles other than the top quark .",
    "we now discuss systematic uncertainties .",
    "we expect the most important systematic uncertainties to be the luminosity uncertainty , theoretical and parton distribution function ( pdf ) uncertainties on the gluon fusion and vector boson fusion cross sections , the background normalization uncertainty particularly in the @xmath72 channels , and the uncertainty in the experimental resolution of the @xmath56 invariant mass used in the higgs width determination .",
    "we comment on these as follows :    * previous studies of higgs coupling extraction from lhc data have assumed a luminosity uncertainty of 5%  @xcite .",
    "recent atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite luminosity determinations from data collected in 2010 have achieved uncertainties of 3.4% and 4.0% , respectively .",
    "normalizing lhc rate measurements to the inclusive @xmath18 or @xmath19 production rates , which are now known to next - to - next - to - leading order in qcd and with next - to - leading order electroweak corrections leading to a theoretical uncertainty below 1% , could replace the luminosity uncertainty with the small statistical and pdf uncertainties on the @xmath18 or @xmath19 rate measurement .",
    "* recent improvements in the calculation of the gluon fusion higgs production cross section have significantly reduced the theoretical uncertainty .",
    "the lhc higgs cross section working group  @xcite quotes a conservative theoretical uncertainty of 8.4% and a pdf uncertainty of 6.8% for @xmath53  gev at the 14  tev lhc ( these numbers become 8.3% and 7.9% at 7  tev center - of - mass energy ) .",
    "other groups are more aggressive on the theory uncertainty ; for example , ref .",
    "@xcite combines the most up - to - date calculations including renormalization - group improvement of the qcd corrections at next - to - next - to - next - to - leading logarithmic accuracy as well as next - to - leading order electroweak corrections , and finds a remaining scale uncertainty of only 1.3% ( 1.5% ) for 14  tev ( 7  tev ) center - of - mass energy .",
    "the uncertainty on the gluon pdf is also expected to improve as lhc data become available to be incorporated into the global pdf fits . * the cross section for higgs production via vector boson fusion",

    "the most important of these has been the @xmath2 background , for which the number of events in the control region is no larger than in the signal region and the extrapolation error from shape uncertainty has been taken as 5%  @xcite .",
    "* the two - lepton invariant mass resolution should be well - calibrated from the @xmath19 peak .",
    "we expect that the four - lepton invariant mass resolution can be determined from this .",
    "we are not aware of a discussion of this uncertainty in the literature .",
    "the higgs lineshape and production rate measurement studies that we used in this analysis were all done for an lhc center - of - mass design energy of 14  tev .",
    "the lhc is currently running at a center - of - mass energy of 7  tev , however , and this lower - energy running is anticipated to continue to the end of 2012 .",
    "the lhc experiments have already collected more than 1  fb@xmath1 of data , and may be able to collect several  fb@xmath1 at this lower center - of - mass energy by the end of 2012 . because of this , it is interesting to consider how much data would be needed at 7  tev to achieve the uncertainties obtained here for 14  tev . for a mass of 190  gev ,",
    "higgs signal cross sections in both gluon fusion and vector boson fusion are smaller by a factor of 3.8  @xcite at 7  tev compared to their values at 14  tev . combining data from both atlas and cms , each experiment would need almost 60  fb@xmath1 at 7  tev to together collect the same number of signal events as used in our analysis of 30  fb@xmath1 at one detector .",
    "a more quantitative estimate would require information on the background cross sections at 7  tev , and possibly involve a new optimization of the signal selections .",

    "<S> we show that combining a direct measurement of the higgs total width from the @xmath0 lineshape with higgs signal rate measurements allows higgs couplings to be extracted in a model - independent way from cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) data . using existing experimental studies with 30  fb@xmath1 at one detector of the 14  tev lhc </S>",
    "<S> , we show that the couplings - squared of a 190  gev higgs to @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 can be extracted with statistical precisions of about 10% , and a 95% confidence level upper limit on an unobserved component of the higgs decay width of about 22% of the sm higgs width can be set . </S>",
    "<S> the method can also be applied for heavier higgs masses . </S>"
