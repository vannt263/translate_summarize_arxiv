    "the difference between the shapes of the two initial kinks is crucial : it means that , after the collision , the kinks are no longer the exact solutions of their new topological sectors .",

    "however , we conjecture this value to be very close to unity .",
    "the difficulty that we encountered in trying to distinguish between the reflection and transition regimes is apparently due to the fact that in the latter regime the two kinks that pass through each other and change their topological sectors quickly evolve into the respective exact solutions of their new sectors .",
    "the emerging configuration thus becomes indistinguishable from that corresponding to a reflection of the two kinks .",

    "quite importantly , @xmath122 tends to different asymptotical values as @xmath120 becomes large and positive or large and negative ; numerically , @xmath123 @xmath124 when @xmath120 is large and positive , the overlap of the two kinks in ( [ eq : kink2 ] ) is exponentially small ; at the same time , each kink is the exact bps - saturated solution of its topological sector .",
    "for this reason , the value of @xmath125 is simply the sum of the masses of the solitary kinks @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",

    "escape window . ]",
    "the origin of the escape windows is the resonant energy exchange : during the first collision , a part of the kink s kinetic energy is transferred into the vibrational mode of the kink , which can not then escape to infinity after the first reflection , hence the kinks collide again .",
    "if a certain resonance condition holds , energy stored in the vibrational mode can be returned back into the kinetic energy , and the kinks are then able to escape .",
    "originally , escape windows were discovered in the @xmath3 model  @xcite and in a modified sine - gordon model  @xcite .",
    "note that the resonant energy exchange can also occur not in the second but in any subsequent collision , so that the kinks escape to infinities after colliding three , four times , etc .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath3 model , the @xmath0 model does not have a vibrational ( shape ) mode in the kinks excitation spectra .",
    "instead , in the collisions of @xmath0 kinks a vibrational mode of the two kinks is excited , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite ( where a very comprehensive study of escape windows in the @xmath0 model was given ) .",
    "a similar mechanism is involved in the so - called quasiresonances in the double sine - gordon model @xcite .",
    "we solved the partial differential equation ( [ eq : eom ] ) and the ordinary differential equation ( [ eq : eiler ] ) with the use of the computer algebra system `` mathematica '' .",
    "the ordinary differential equation was solved by the livermore solver for ordinary differential equations with the automatic switching for nonstiff ( adams ) and stiff ( bdf ) methods ) .",

    "the aim of the present study has been a detailed comprehensive investigation of the applicability of the collective coordinate approximation with @xmath4 degree of freedom to modeling of the kink - kink collision processes . unlike previous authors ,",
    "we performed modeling in all the configuration types [ note that in the pairs @xmath110 and @xmath80 , @xmath149 and @xmath179 , as well as @xmath5 and @xmath180 , each of the two configurations is dynamically equivalent to the other ; hence , only one configuration is needed to be considered in each pair ] .",
    "we also compare the results of both methods and draw conclusions about the applicability of the collective coordinate approximation in each of these cases . in the sector @xmath5",
    "we do not confirm the discrepancy reported by the author of ref .",
    "@xcite . in the sectors",
    "@xmath110 and @xmath149 we discovered , solving the exact equation of motion ( [ eq : eom ] ) numerically , that the two colliding kinks can form a long - lived bound state ( a bion ) .",
    "we provide a qualitative explanation of the process of the bion formation , based on the dynamics of a kink that leaves its topological sector and stops being a nearly exact solution . in the sector @xmath149",
    ", we confirm the existence of escape windows .",
    "the kink scattering in the sector @xmath5 at sufficiently small initial velocities can be modeled reasonably well in the framework of the collective coordinate approach .",
    "the basis for this conclusion is a good agreement between the results of the two methods used in this work .    at the same time",
    ", the exact evolution of the kinks in low - velocity @xmath166 collisions exhibits a capture of the kinks by each other and the resulting formation of a long - lived quasibound state of the two kinks .",
    "this phenomenon occurs in the kink - kink collisions where the asymptotics at the positive and the negative infinities are the same , i.e. ,  in the sectors @xmath110 and @xmath149 .",
    "note that in all these cases the interaction between the kinks is attractive .",
    "however , within the framework of the collective coordinate approximation without effective friction it appears impossible to describe a bound state of the two kinks .    in the sector @xmath110 the kinks can pass through each other and escape to infinity .",
    "this process is observed both in the collective coordinate approach and in the exact numerical dynamics .",
    "the values of the critical velocity obtained by the two methods are rather close ( within @xmath181 ) .",
    "in addition , one encounters the resonant energy exchange between the translational and the vibrational modes of the two colliding kinks in the sector @xmath149 .",
    "this mechanism leads to the escape windows at @xmath166 , which are well studied and described for the @xmath0 model in @xcite .",
    "of course , within the collective coordinate approximation with @xmath4 degree of freedom we can observe no resonance phenomena .",
    "note that in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown , however , that the escape windows can be reproduced within the collective coordinate method if the interaction with the vibrational mode of the kink is taken into account .",
    "a recent publication @xcite should be mentioned here , where the vibrational modes of the kinks have been taken into account in the framework of the collective coordinate approach .",
    "it allows one to simulate resonance phenomena such as the escape windows or the quasiresonances .",
    "thus , the collective coordinate approximation with @xmath4 degree of freedom provides , in general , a good description of the kink - kink collision process at intermediate initial velocities . at low initial velocities in the sectors @xmath110 and @xmath149 the exact dynamics is qualitatively different from that predicted by the collective coordinate approximation . at the same time , at ultrarelativistic initial velocities notable quantitative discrepancies are observed .    note that in the sector @xmath5 the interaction between the kinks has a repulsive character and a bound state of the kinks can not be formed .",
    "the collective coordinate approach works well also for small initial velocities in that sector .",
    "our analysis of the collective coordinate approximation applied to kink - kink collisions in the @xmath0 model demonstrates the following apparently rather general properties of this method .",
    "first , the applicability of the collective coordinate approximation is limited to nonrelativistic kinks velocities , since the chosen ansatz and the effective lagrange function are not lorentz invariant by construction .",
    "this results in large deviations from the exact evolution at relativistic velocities of colliding kinks .",
    "although this shortcoming of the method can be fixed by properly taking into account the lorentz invariance , this would also result in significantly more complex equations of motion describing the dynamics of the collective coordinate .",
    "second , there are phenomena occurring at low velocities of the colliding kinks in the presence of an effective attractive interaction between the kinks , such as the resonant energy exchange or the kink - kink capture .",
    "the collective coordinate approximation with a single collective coordinate does not include the degrees of freedom that are responsible for the correct description of these phenomena .",
    "for instance , this method does not reproduce the escape windows or the formation of a bion . on the other hand , the regime when the two kinks only interact with each other for a short time ( e.g. , when there is a repulsive force between the kinks or when their collision velocity is large enough ) is described well within the collective coordinate approximation . apparently , these limitations of the method are quite general and hence our analysis of the @xmath0 kink - kink collisions could provide a `` rule of thumb '' useful in studies of other models in the collective coordinate approximation .    in conclusion , we emphasize that the present study opens wide prospects for further research .",
    "in particular , as already mentioned , the kink @xmath53 in the sector @xmath51 starts to decay and as a consequence changes its velocity .",
    "we suppose that this phenomenon may be described by analyzing the impact of the decay on the kink s zero ( translational ) mode .",
