    "in the last years effects due to strong electron - phonon ( @xmath0 ) interactions and polaronic signatures have been evidenced in several compounds , such as high - temperature cuprate superconductors , @xcite colossal magnetoresistance manganites , @xcite fullerenes , @xcite carbon nanotubes @xcite and @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite this amount of experimental data has stimulated the study of different @xmath0 coupled systems . among the most studied models",
    "there are the holstein lattice model @xcite characterized by a very short - range ( @xmath2 ) @xmath0 interaction , and the fr@xmath3hlich model @xcite that takes into account long - range ( @xmath4 ) @xmath0 couplings in polar compounds treating the dielectric as a continuum medium .",
    "moreover , more realistic lattice interaction models including both @xmath2 and @xmath4 couplings have been recently introduced .",
    "@xcite    within the holstein model a tight - binding electron locally couples to optical phonon modes . for intermediate @xmath0 couplings and electron and phonon energy scales",
    "not well separated , it has been found by numerical studies @xcite and variational approaches @xcite that the system undergoes a crossover from a weakly dressed electron to a massive localized polaronic quasiparticle , the small holstein polaron ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "a variational approach @xcite proposed by some of us and based on a linear superposition between the bloch states characteristic of the weak and strong coupling regime is able to describe all the ground state properties with great accuracy .",
    "moreover this method provides an immediate physical interpretation of the intermediate regime characterized by the polaron crossover .",
    "recently a discrete version of the fr@xmath3hlich model has been introduced in order to understand the role of @xmath4 coupling on the formation of the lattice polaron .",
    "@xcite due to the @xmath4 interaction , the polaron is much lighter than the @xmath5 with the same binding energy in the strong coupling regime .",
    "@xcite furthermore the lattice deformation induced by the electron is spread over many lattice sites giving rise to the formation of a large polaron ( @xmath6 ) also in the strong coupling region .",
    "@xcite extending the variational approach previously proposed for the study of systems with local @xmath0 coupling , many properties have been studied by some of us as a function of the model parameters focusing on the adiabatic regime .",
    "@xcite indeed there is a range of values of the @xmath0 coupling where the ground state is well described by a particle with a weakly renormalized mass but a spectral weight much smaller than unity .",
    "furthermore , with increasing the strength of interaction in the same regime , the renormalized mass gradually increases , while the average kinetic energy is not strongly reduced . finally due to the @xmath4 coupling a strong",
    "mixing between electronic and phononic degrees of freedom has been found even for small values of the @xmath0 coupling constant .",
    "both the @xmath2 holstein and the @xmath4 discrete fr@xmath3hlich model can be described by a quite general hamiltonian @xmath7    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the interacting force between an electron on the site @xmath10 and an ion displacement on the site @xmath11 . in eq.([1r ] ) @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) denotes the electron creation ( annihilation ) operator at site @xmath10 , whose position vector is indicated by @xmath14 , and the symbol @xmath15 denotes nearest neighbors ( @xmath16 ) linked through the transfer integral @xmath17 .",
    "the operator @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) represents the creation ( annihilation ) operator for phonon on the site",
    "@xmath10 , @xmath20 is the frequency of the optical local phonon modes , and @xmath21 controls the strength of @xmath0 coupling .",
    "the units are such that @xmath22 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ 1r ] ) reduces to the holstein model for @xmath23 while in the @xmath4 case @xcite the interaction force is given by @xmath24 if the distance @xmath25 is measured in units of lattice constant .",
    "in addition to the @xmath2 and @xmath4 case , in this work we analyze the properties of the system where the electron couples with local and @xmath16 lattice displacements . in this case",
    "the interaction force becomes @xmath26 where @xmath27 indicates the @xmath16 sites .",
    "for all the couplings of eqs .",
    "( [ force1],[force],[force2 ] ) the @xmath0 matrix element in the momentum space @xmath28 is @xmath29 with @xmath30 number of lattice sites . through the matrix element",
    "@xmath28 we can define the polaronic shift @xmath31 @xmath32 and the coupling constant @xmath33 , with @xmath34 lattice coordination number , that represents a natural measure of the strength of the @xmath0 coupling for any range of the interaction . limiting the analysis to the one - dimensional case , the matrix element @xmath28",
    "is reported in fig . 1 for the @xmath2 , @xmath4 , and @xmath16 extended range ( @xmath35 ) couplings .",
    "in the @xmath2 case the coupling is constant as function of the transferred phononic momentum , while in the @xmath4 case the vertex is peaked around @xmath36 . with increasing the ratio @xmath37 ,",
    "the @xmath35 interaction deviates from the constant behavior developing a peak around @xmath38 .",
    "actually for the ratio @xmath39 the interaction vertex of the @xmath35 case is close to the behavior of the @xmath4 coupling .    in this paper",
    "we adopt the variational approach previously proposed @xcite for the study of systems with local and @xmath4 @xmath0 interactions in order to study the system with @xmath16 @xmath35 @xmath0 coupling .",
    "the aim is to investigate the crossover from @xmath2 to @xmath4 interactions in the @xmath35 model .",
    "the evolution of the ground - state spectral weight , the average kinetic energy , the mean number of phonons , and the electron - lattice correlation function with respect to the adiabaticity ratio @xmath40 and the @xmath0 coupling constant is discussed comparing the results with the local and @xmath4 case . for large values of the @xmath16",
    "@xmath0 coupling many properties show a behavior similar to those obtained for the @xmath4 @xmath0 interaction .",
    "regions of the model parameters are distinguished according to the values assumed by the spectral weight giving rise to a polaronic phase diagram .",
    "the transition line between the crossover and the strong coupling regime continuously evolves toward that of the @xmath4 case by increasing the coupling of the @xmath35 system . finally , for intermediate values of this coupling , the correlation function between electron and @xmath16 lattice displacements shows an upturn with increasing the @xmath0 constant @xmath41 .",
    "in section ii the variational approach is reviewed , while in section iii the results are discussed .",
    "in this section the variational approach is briefly summarized .",
    "details can be found in previous works .",
    "@xcite    the trial wave functions are translational invariant bloch states obtained by taking a superposition of localized states centered on different lattice sites @xmath42 where @xmath43 } \\sum_m \\phi^{(i)}_{\\vec{k}}(\\vec{r}_m ) c^{\\dagger}_{m+n}|0 > .",

    "( [ 12rn ] ) the apex @xmath44 indicates the weak and strong coupling polaron wave function , respectively , @xmath45 denotes the electron and phonon vacuum state , and @xmath46 are variational parameters defining the spatial broadening of the electronic wave function .",
    "the phonon distribution functions @xmath47 are chosen in order to reproduce polaron features in the two asymptotic limits .",
    "@xcite    in the intermediate regime the weak and strong coupling wave functions are not orthogonal and the off - diagonal matrix elements of the hamiltonian are not zero",
    ". therefore the ground state properties are determined by considering as trial state @xmath48 a linear superposition of the weak and strong coupling wave functions @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 @xmath52 is the overlap factor of the two wave functions @xmath53 and @xmath54 . in eq.([31r ] ) @xmath55 and @xmath56 are two additional variational parameters which provide the relative weight of the weak and strong coupling solutions for any particular value of @xmath57 .",
    "the variational minimization is performed extending the electron wave function up to fifth neighbors .",
    "in this section we discuss ground state properties in the one - dimensional case for the different ranges of @xmath0 coupling .    in fig .",
    "2(a ) we report the polaron ground state energy as a function of the @xmath0 constant coupling @xmath41 .",
    "the variational method recovers the perturbative results and improves significantly these asymptotic estimates in the intermediate region . in this regime",
    "the energy decreases with increasing the range of the @xmath58 coupling .",
    "moreover , with increasing the range of the coupling , the crossover between the weak and strong coupling solution becomes less evident .",
    "actually , as shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) , there are marked differences in the ratio @xmath59 that is the weight of the strong coupling solution with respect to the weak coupling one . in the @xmath2 case",
    "the strong coupling solution provides all the contribution since the overlap with the weak coupling function is negligible .",
    "however , with increasing the range of the interaction , the weight of the weak coupling function increases and the polaronic crossover becomes smooth .",
    "another quantity that gives insight about the properties of the electron state is the average kinetic energy @xmath60 reported in fig .",
    "2(c ) ( in units of the bare electron energy ) .",
    "while in the @xmath2 case @xmath60 is strongly reduced , in the @xmath4 case it is only weakly renormalized stressing that the self - trapping of the electron occurs for larger couplings with increasing the range of the interaction",
    ". finally the mean number of phonons is plotted in fig .",
    "2(d ) . in the weak - coupling regime",
    "the interaction of the electron with displacements on different sites is able to excite more phonons .",
    "however , in the strong coupling regime there is an inversion in the roles played by @xmath2 and @xmath35 interaction .",
    "indeed the @xmath5 is strongly localized on the site allowing a larger number of local phonons to be excited .",
    "in addition to the quantities discussed in fig .",
    "2 , other properties change remarkably with increasing the ratio @xmath37 .",
    "an interesting property is the ground state spectral weight @xmath61 , that measures the fraction of the bare electron state in the polaronic trial wave function . as plotted in fig .",
    "3(a ) , the increase of the @xmath0 coupling strength induces a decrease of the spectral weight that is more evident with increasing the range of the @xmath0 coupling . only in the strong coupling regime",
    "the spectral weights calculated for different ranges assume similar small values .",
    "while for the local holstein model @xmath62 , as the @xmath35 case is considered , @xmath61 becomes progressively smaller than @xmath63 in analogy with the behavior due to the @xmath4 interaction .",
    "@xcite we have found that for the ratio @xmath39 there is a region of intermediate values of @xmath41 where the ground state is described by a particle with a weakly renormalized mass but a spectral weight @xmath61 much smaller than unity . in fig .",
    "3(b ) we propose a phase diagram based on the values assumed by the spectral weight making a comparison with that obtained in the @xmath2 and @xmath4 case . @xcite analyzing the behavior of @xmath61 it is possible to distinguish different regimes , for example the crossover regime ( @xmath64 ) characterized by intermediate values of spectral weight and a mass not strongly enhanced for the @xmath35 case , and strong coupling regime ( @xmath65 ) where the spectral weight is negligible and the mass is large but not enormous if the range of the coupling increases . with increasing the range of the interactions in the adiabatic case",
    "there is strong mixing of electronic and phononic degrees of freedom for values of @xmath41 smaller than those characteristic of local holstein interaction .",
    "furthermore , entering the strong coupling regime , the charge carrier is still mobile and it does not undergo any abrupt localization . only in the antiadiabatic regime the transition lines separating the crossover from the strong coupling regime tend to superimpose .",
    "another important quantity associated to the polaron formation is the correlation function @xmath66 @xmath67 in fig .",
    "4(a ) we report the correlation function @xmath68 at @xmath69 for several ranges of the @xmath0 interaction . in analogy with the behavior of the average number of phonons discussed in fig .",
    "2(d ) , the on - site correlation function is larger with increasing the range of the interaction in the weak coupling regime , but it becomes smaller as function of the coupling constant @xmath41 in the strong coupling region indicating the the @xmath5 is more effective in producing local lattice distortions .",
    "actually in the @xmath35 and @xmath4 case , the lattice deformation is spread over @xmath16 or many lattice sites , respectively , giving rise to the formation of @xmath6 also in the strong coupling regime .",
    "therefore it is interesting to analyze the behavior of the correlation function at @xmath16 sites . as reported in fig .",
    "4(b ) , in the @xmath2 case there is a minimum as function of @xmath41 since the particle tends to localize on a single site with increasing the @xmath0 coupling . in the @xmath4 case",
    "the lattice distortion shows a decreasing behavior with increasing @xmath41 indicating that the nearest neighbor contribution is always relevant .",
    "however for intermediate values of the ratio @xmath37 in the @xmath35 case , the correlation function shows an upturn as function of the coupling constant @xmath41 .",
    "actually , for small values of the coupling , this function tends to follow the behavior of the local interaction , but , with increasing the value of @xmath41 , the coupling to the @xmath16 lattices is able to give deviations from the @xmath2 case .",
    "in fact the lattice deformation reaches a maximum , then begins to decrease following the behavior of the @xmath4 interaction .",
    "therefore , as function of @xmath41 , two different regimes in the correlation function can be evidenced .",
    "in this paper we have extended a variational approach in order to study the polaronic ground - state features of a one dimensional @xmath0 model with coupling to local and @xmath16 lattice displacements .",
    "many physical quantities such as the ground state energy and spectral weight , the average kinetic energy , the mean number of phonons , and the electron - lattice correlation function have been discussed making a comparison with the results obtained with @xmath2 and @xmath4 interactions .",
    "it has been possible to ascertain that most physical quantities are quantitatively equal to those obtained for the @xmath4 interaction as the @xmath0 coupling in the @xmath35 case is large .",
    "a polaronic phase diagram based on the values assumed by the spectral weight has been proposed .",
    "it has been shown that the transition lines between the crossover and the strong coupling regime continuously evolve toward that of the @xmath4 case by increasing the coupling of the @xmath35 system .",
    "the deviations of the @xmath35 case from @xmath4 case become evident only in quantities depending on distances larger than the lattice parameter , such as in the electron - lattice correlation function . at neighbor nearest sites for large values of the coupling ,",
    "the @xmath35 interaction is able to reproduce the correlation function characteristic of the @xmath4 , while , at intermediate values of the ratio @xmath37 , the lattice deformation shows an upturn as function of the coupling constant @xmath41 .",
    "recently , a variational wave function @xcite has been proposed to study the polaron formation in su - schrieffer - heeger ( @xmath70 ) model where the electronic transfer integral depends on the relative displacement between @xmath16 sites . unlike the original @xmath70 model , the non - local electron - lattice coupling has been assumed to be due to the interaction with optical phonon modes .",
    "it has been shown that with this type of interaction the tendency towards localization is hindered from the pathological sign change of the effective next - nearest - neighbor hopping .",
    "therefore it is not possible to reach the strong coupling regime where most properties obtained with the @xmath35 density - type @xmath0 coupling bear strong resemblance with those in the @xmath4 model .",
    "only the coupling with acoustic phonons is able to provide a solution with localized behavior within the @xmath70 model . @xcite",
    "the variational approach for models with density - type @xmath0 coupling can be generalized to high dimensions , where it can still give a good description of ground state features .",
    "@xcite however , in order to reproduce with the @xmath35 interaction most physical quantities of the @xmath4 case , with increasing the dimensionality , it is important to include not only coupling terms at @xmath16 sites but also at next nearest neighbors .",
    "actually it is necessary that the expansion of the coupling to near sites gives rise to an @xmath0 interaction vertex similar to that obtained in the @xmath4 case . under these conditions",
    "the variational method is able to interpolate between the behavior of the @xmath2 case to the @xmath4 one with increasing the coupling of the interaction with close sites .",
