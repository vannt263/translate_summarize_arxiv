    "recently the transresistance @xmath6 between two parallel two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems  @xcite has been studied extensively due to advances in measuring  @xcite techniques . in most previous studies",
    "@xcite only wide systems were considered , in which edge effects can be ignored .",
    "however , edge effects become prominent in narrow systems especially when a magnetic field @xmath1 is present and the highest bulk ll is completely occupied .",
    "the electronic edge states are very different from the bulk states .",
    "for instance , if a weak random impurity potential is present , the bulk states are disordered  @xcite and occur in a series of energy bands of finite width @xmath7 , centered about the lls with no states in the region between them . on the other hand ,",
    "the edge states are degenerate with respect to the lls .",
    "this can lead to profound differences in transport properties between the case when the highest bulk ll is completely occupied and that when it is not .    in this paper",
    "we study the influence of edge states on the drag by solving _ self - consistently _ the coulomb - coupled schrdinger equations for two _ narrow _ hall bars .",
    "this goes substantially beyond the simple , not self - consistent treatments of ref .",
    "@xcite that used a parabolic confining potential . here the potential is evaluated self - consistently from an initial square - well potential .",
    "we find that a current @xmath8 is always induced in the direction of @xmath0 and the coulomb interaction lifts the degeneracy of all occupied edge lls , but not that of unoccupied and neighbouring - occupied edge lls .",
    "the coulomb drag obtained is _ two - to - three orders of magnitude larger _ than that in zero field due to the increase in the available density of states when an external magnetic field is present . as the filling factor @xmath3 of the highest ll approaches 1 , _ near - edge inter - ll transitions _",
    "occur between this ll and that just above it .",
    "these transitions make @xmath2 or @xmath5 change sign when the circuit in the drag layer is closed or open , respectively .",
    "thus , this negative drag is neither due to a thermal gradient  @xcite nor to to an electron - hole coupling .    in the next section we present the formalism . in sec .",
    "iii we present and discuss the numerical results .",
    "we conclude with remarks in sec .",
    "consider two quantum hall bars parallel to the @xmath9 plane , separated by a distance @xmath10 along the @xmath11 axis , of thickness zero , width @xmath12 , and length @xmath13 .",
    "the electrons are confined along @xmath14 by infinitely high potential barriers . in a field @xmath15 ,",
    "the electron wavefunction in the drive layer @xmath16 , when the circuit in the @xmath17 direction is closed , has the form @xmath18 and @xmath19 obeys    @xmath20\\psi_{nk}^a   ( x ) = e_{nk}^a \\psi_{nk}^a ( x ) .",

    "( 3)-(5 ) @xmath35 , @xmath36 or @xmath22 , @xmath37 is the background charge density , @xmath38 is the fermi function , and @xmath39 .",
    "notice that @xmath40 in eq .",
    "( @xmath41 ) since no current flows through in the drag layer .",
    "we take the effective background densities equal @xmath42 and constant .",
    "the schrdinger equations for the drive and drag layers are solved self - consistently .    the weight function",
    "@xmath43 depends on @xmath44 and expresses the degeneracy of the lls .",
    "when the @xmath24-th ll is completely filled , we have @xmath45 .",
    "when it is partially filled , we determine @xmath43 self - consistently  @xcite from @xmath44 and the level broadening @xmath46 due to scatterers from the assumptions ( i ) @xmath46 is independent of @xmath47 , and ( ii ) the total neutrality of the hall bar and the local neutrality at its center are maintained .",
    "the meaning of these assumptions becomes clear if we consider two limiting cases for the average filling factor of the highest ll @xmath48 .",
    "first , for an infinitely wide bar without edges , the energy levels @xmath49 is definitely degenerate with respect to the wave vector @xmath47 and everywhere we have the same filling factor @xmath50 .",
    "secondly , for a _ narrow _ hall bar without the @xmath47 degeneracy in @xmath49 and @xmath51 , all @xmath47 states are occupied if @xmath52 .",
    "but if @xmath53 , not all @xmath47 states are occupied and electrons prefer those low - lying energy states near the center of the bar",
    ". therefore the actual width of the hall bar , defined by the density of electrons , will shrink to roughly @xmath54 and in it the filling factor is still @xmath55 even though @xmath56 is less than 1 .",
    "in reality , there is scattering which broadens @xmath49 by , say , @xmath57 . within @xmath57 , we assume that each @xmath47 has the same electron occupancy , so the local filling factor depends on the local density of states at @xmath47 .",
    "this average electron occupancy depends on the density of states @xmath58 and is reflected in @xmath59\\\\ *    & & + \\theta ( { \\bar\\nu}_n n_n ( 0 ) - n_n ( k ) ) \\label{degen}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the heaviside step function and @xmath61 is the filling factor of the @xmath24th ll .",
    "consequently , the electron density is nonzero within the width of the bar with local filling factor @xmath62 . at the center of the bar , which corresponds roughly to @xmath63",
    ", we have @xmath64 .",
    "this ensures the neutrality at the center which is in contrast with the single - layer treatment of ref .",
    "@xcite where only the total neutrality was preserved and only the @xmath65 situation could be handled . in our case , this local neutrality at the center ensures that @xmath66 at @xmath63 . in eq .",
    "( @xmath67 ) , @xmath68 is the shift of the fermi surface  @xcite that results from the application of a current @xmath69 through the drive layer in the presence of scattering .",
    "the drive and induced currents , @xmath0 and @xmath8 , are given by    @xmath70    and    @xmath71    where @xmath72 .",
    "@xmath73 consists not only of the current induced by momentum transfer but also of the classical @xmath74-drift  @xcite current in the direction of @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the average of a finite electrostatic field @xmath77 exerted on the drag electrons by the charges which accumulate at the edges of the drive layer and produce the hall voltage .",
    "this field @xmath77 opens up the circular orbit of the drag electrons by accelerating those moving opposite to it and decelerating those moving in its direction  @xcite .",
    "thus it induces an average current @xmath78 in the direction of @xmath4 parallel to @xmath79 given by    @xmath80    and @xmath81 obeys eq .",

    "( @xmath92 ) eliminates electron transitions between different @xmath47 s .",
    "thus the current due to momentum transfer is    @xmath93    for fully occupied lls",
    "we have @xmath94 and @xmath2 vanishes but the classical @xmath95-drift @xmath78 does not .      when the circuit in the drag layer is opened , apart from the voltage induced by the @xmath95-drift , a drag voltage @xmath96 develops along the bar as shown in fig .",
    "1 . in a short time",
    "@xmath97 it produces an intermediate current ,    @xmath98    _ across the width _ , due to the @xmath99-drift .",
    "this results in an electric field @xmath100 , across the width , which produces another @xmath101-drift current _ opposite _ to @xmath2 .",
    "the steady - state is reached when these two currents are equal so that all the @xmath102-drifts are balanced .",
    "thus , @xmath103 is given by    @xmath104    with @xmath105 the highest occcupied bulk ll number .",
    "the drag voltage is then    @xmath106    where the minus sign is inserted according to the usual ohm s law convention ; @xmath2 is given by eq .",
    "we consider a gaas sample at zero temperature , with @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and @xmath1 chosen such that @xmath109 .",
    "the schrdinger equations for the drive and drag layers are solved self - consistently and the average electron and current densities of the drag - layer , with @xmath110 and @xmath111 , are plotted in fig .",
    "2 . the solid and dotted curves represent equilibrium and nonequilibrium quantities , respectively .",
    "3 shows that the current density of the main figure is not symmetric . @xmath112 and @xmath113",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "the rapid change of @xmath113 near the edges reflects the structure of the boundaries between edge and disordered bulk states . as shown in fig .",
    "2 , the current - density ( @xmath114 ) plot has qualitatively five different zones , namely the outer - edge ( @xmath115 ) and inner - edge ( @xmath116 ) zones on both sides of the bar , and one bulk zone ( @xmath117 ) . in the outer - edge zone @xmath114 is opposite to that in the inner - edge zone and in the bulk zone it is negligible .    to understand the results of fig .",
    "2 we consider the single - electron motion .",
    "we first treat the equilibrium case ( @xmath118 , @xmath119 ) . for finite @xmath120 , @xmath114 near the edge",
    "is affected by the sharp changes of the electron density @xmath121 and of the effective confining potential . near the left edge ,",
    "the gradient @xmath122 is so large that there are more electrons , with guiding center at @xmath123 , e.g. , near the maximum of @xmath121 at @xmath124 , flowing into the paper ( @xmath17 direction ) than adjacent electrons , with guiding center at @xmath125 , flowing out of the paper ; this gives rise to a local @xmath114 , at @xmath14 , in the negative @xmath17 direction .",
    "this diamagnetic - drift current is thus proportional  @xcite to @xmath122 . in the same region",
    "the local effective electric field @xmath126 , produced by electrons in the center of the bar , pushes the electrons towards the edge .",
    "this produces a @xmath127-drift current  @xcite pointing in the same direction as the diamagnetic - drift current .",
    "however , for electrons located further away from the edges @xmath128 changes direction .",
    "it pushes the electrons away from the edge towards the center of the bar , and produces a @xmath129-drift @xmath114 , proportional  @xcite to @xmath130 that points in the _ positive _ ( negative ) @xmath17 direction at the left ( right ) edge . in most of the outer - edge region ,",
    "the @xmath131-drift is comparable to the diamagnetic - drift whereas in the inner - edge region the @xmath131-drift dominates .",
    "as for the bulk zone , @xmath122 and @xmath132 are almost zero and so is @xmath114 . if we define the average drift velocities carried by the outer - left - edge current , inner - left - edge current , inner - right - edge and outer - right - edge currents as @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 and @xmath136 , respectively , with corresponding average electron densities @xmath137 , @xmath138 @xmath139 and @xmath140 , the total current density is    @xmath141    when no current is driven ( @xmath142 ) , we have @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 , or in other words the current density on the left edge balances out that on the right edge and thus @xmath147 . when @xmath0 is switched on ( @xmath148 ) , @xmath149 and @xmath150 change .",
    "this affects the drag electrons in two ways .",
    "firstly , on the average there are more electrons at @xmath151 than at @xmath152 due to @xmath153 , i.e. @xmath154 and this leads to an imbalance of @xmath114 .",
    "secondly , the inner - edge zone , shown in fig .",
    "2 , expands into the bulk zone due to the change in @xmath155 .",
    "the resulting total @xmath2 is parallel to @xmath4 for @xmath111 .",
    "as @xmath3 increases , the inner - edge zone expands further , due to the increase of @xmath150 in the bulk zone ( the guiding - center coordinate is proportional to @xmath47 ) , as contrasting fig .",
    "2 with fig .",
    "5 shows ; there is an increase in both @xmath156 and @xmath139 with @xmath157 and thus decreases @xmath2 . for @xmath3 integer .",
    "as @xmath3 approaches an integer , @xmath158 in the bulk is the same as that in the edge zones and there is no bulk activity contributing to the drag current .",
    "however , the eigenvalues @xmath149 , shown in fig . 7 , with @xmath159 near @xmath160 and @xmath161 near @xmath162 , are degenerate .",
    "now the electrons prefer to occupy the inner - edge zone , lower - energy sites , with @xmath163 and @xmath164 , rather than the outer - edge zone , higher - energy sites , with @xmath105 and @xmath165 .",
    "this results in the current density shown in fig .",
    "since the drag current is the total induced current minus the classical @xmath166-drift , we view these empty states as holes in the @xmath105th ll responsible for @xmath2 .",
    "these holes are responsible for the outer - edge currents .",
    "since there are more holes at the left edge than at the right edge and holes are moving opposite to the outer - edge electrons of the drive - layer , the induced current flows opposite to that due to electrons .",
    "on the other hand , electrons in the inner - edge zones of the @xmath163 ll have a total current in the same direction as that due to the holes .. when the sum of these two currents exceeds that due to electrons in the bulk @xmath105th ll , the total current @xmath2 , calculated by integrating @xmath167 over the hall bar , flows opposite to @xmath0 in contrast with the @xmath168 case where it flows in the direction of @xmath0 for two electron layers .",
    "accordingly , the drag voltage , shown on the right axis of fig . 5 ,",
    "changes sign when @xmath3 approaches 1 and has a minimum in the vicinity of @xmath169 .",
    "this change of sign occurs also in @xmath170 , when allowed to flow , as eq .",
    "( 12 ) shows .",
    "the predicted _ negative _ coulomb drag can best be tested in an open - circuit configuration , i.e. , by measuring the voltage difference along the bar to avoid the effect of scattering in the drag layer .",
    "a transient measurement should be conducted to resolve the classical @xmath166-drift induced voltage from the momentum - transfer induced @xmath5 since the response time of the classical drift is far shorter than that of @xmath5 .",
    "an overshoot of the measured voltage would signal the _ negative _ coulomb drag .",
    "finally , we notice that the induced drag , for @xmath3 integer or half - integer , is about _ two - to - three orders of magnitude larger _ than that at zero field @xmath1 .",
    "this is due to the fact the @xmath168 states condense into lls when @xmath171 and agrees with the results of ref .",
    "we have shown , within a self - consistent hartree approximation , that the current density in coulomb - coupled _ narrow _ hall bars has different current zones that change with filling factor @xmath3 .",
    "in addition to the zero - field momentum - transfer current @xmath2 , the hall voltage developed in the drive layer gives rise to a classical @xmath95-drift current @xmath78 when the circuit is closed .",
    "as @xmath3 increases from 0.5 towards 1 , @xmath2 or @xmath5 decreases and , when @xmath172 , it changes sign .",
    "this change occurs because electrons make energetically favorable _ near - edge inter - ll transitions_. we expect that the values of @xmath3 where the drag changes sign depend only weakly on the initial confining potential . in the present study we took the latter square - well in form and evaluated the resulting potential self - consistently .",
    "another choice would be an initially parabolic potential , but the results would be qualitatively the same .",
    "it is evident that the above negative drag is neither due to a thermal gradient  @xcite nor due to the conventional electron - hole coupling since we are dealing with electron layers .",
    "also , since we have neglected tunneling between the layers , it can not be identified with the observed negative drag of ref .  @xcite . as we suggested in sec .",
    "iv , it could be tested with time - dependent measurements .",
    "finally , it should be noted that since we considered an applied current in the drive layer in the presence of scattering , i.e. , a clearly _ nonequilibrium _ case , the resulting drag is a _ dissipative _ one and not the _ non - dissipative _ _ equilibrium _ drag of ref",
    ".  @xcite .",
    "it is a result of the broadening of the landau levels introduced by scattering coupled with the nonequilibrium effect as is evident from eq .",
    "( @xmath173 ) in which the occupation is determined self - consistently . the scattering is embodied in @xmath174 .",
    "if we were to treat this system as a non - dissipative one , @xmath174 would be 1 and thus @xmath175 .",
    "as for the use of @xmath176 in the fermi function , to account for the nonequilibrium distribution function , it should be said that it was made , in the spirit of ref .",
    "@xcite , in order to simplify the heavily involved self - consistent calculations .",
    "a thorough treatment would have to determine the distribution function from the boltzmann equation .",
