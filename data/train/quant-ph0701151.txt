    "it is well known that the presence of macroscopic bodies can drastically change the properties of the electromagnetic field compared to those observed in free space .",
    "a prominent manifestation of the body - induced change of the ground - state fluctuations of the field is the casimir  polder ( cp ) force experienced by an atom when placed within an arrangement of unpolarized ground - state bodies ( for a review , see ref .",
    "originally , cp forces were studied for ground - state atoms where the cp potential can be identified with the position - dependent part of the atom  field coupling energy @xcite . since in this case",
    "the coupling involves only off - resonant , virtual transitions of the system , the coupling energy can be calculated by means of time - independent leading - order perturbation theory .    for excited systems , on the contrary",
    ", real transitions must be taken into account .",
    "in particular , when applying the method to an atom in an excited energy eigenstate which interacts with the body - assisted electromagnetic vacuum , one finds that the corresponding cp potential can be significantly enhanced @xcite .",
    "the enhancement is due to the influence of now possible real transitions to lower states , with the dependence of the force on the atomic transition frequencies exhibiting the typical dispersion profiles in the vicinity of medium resonances .",
    "since these transitions are also responsible for the decay of the atomic excitation , the application of the static approach to the cp force on an excited atom becomes questionable .",
    "moreover , perturbative methods are known to break down when an atom near - resonantly interacts with a body - assisted narrow - band field such that the strong - coupling regime is realized ; this is typically the case when the bodies form a resonatorlike structure . for a two - level atom that ( according to the jaynes  cummings model @xcite ) is assumed to near - resonantly interact with a single monochromatic mode , it is well known that the energies of the exact excited energy eigenstates of the coupled system  the so - called dressed states  are symmetrically shifted above / below the mean of the unperturbed energy eigenvalues . as",
    "the dressed - state energies depend on the atomic position , they can be interpreted as cp potentials @xcite  in generalization of the static approach based on leading - order perturbation theory . in particular in the case of a perfect standing wave in a cavity ,",
    "it turns out that , depending on the upper / lower dressed state the system is prepared in , the atom is repelled from / attracted to the antinodes of the wave  an effect that can strongly affect the motion of the atom @xcite .",
    "calculations imply that atoms sufficiently slowly incident on a cavity in a direction parallel to the standing wave can be reflected from the cavity due to the influence of the upper dressed state @xcite . here",
    ", the dependence of the transmission probability on the velocity of the incident atoms displays a resonance structure @xcite which may be used to construct a velocity filter for atoms @xcite . in the case of atoms incident in a direction normal to the standing wave ,",
    "the atoms may be deflected during their passage through the cavity @xcite .",
    "in fact , even if a dressed state was prepared very accurately , the system would not stay in this state forever , but it would undergo a temporal evolution due to unavoidable dissipation , and so would the cp force . to describe the time - dependence of cp forces acting on excited systems , a dynamical approach is required . for weak atom  field coupling , it has been shown that when an initially excited atom exponentially decays to the ground state , the associated cp force shows a similar transient behavior and eventually changes to the ground - state force in the long - time limit @xcite . a two - level atom which is initially prepared in the upper state and which strongly interacts with a ( vacuum ) cavity field undergoes rabi oscillations which are damped due to dissipation ;",
    "this effect may be phenomenologically incorporated in the jaynes ",
    "cummings model via damping constants @xcite .",
    "as simulated in refs .",
    "@xcite , the losses can be compensated for in a controlled way by introducing an external pumping laser .",
    "furthermore , by appropriate choice of the laser intensity and frequency , it can be ensured that the system remains in a certain steady state associated with an effective cp potential , both the sign and magnitude of which can be continuously controlled .",
    "such a setup has been used to trap single ( cold ) atoms in the antinodes of a standing wave in a cavity @xcite . since the coupling of the atom  cavity system to the pump laser depends on the atomic position within the standing wave , it is possible to continuously monitor the atomic motion by recording the intensity of the pump laser leaving the cavity @xcite .",
    "this information can be used in a feedback mechanism to enhance the trapping efficiency ; whenever the atom tends to leave the wave antinode , the trap depth is enlarged by increasing the pump laser intensity @xcite .    in the present paper , we study the resonant cp force exerted on a two - level atom that strongly interacts with a body - assisted electromagnetic field in more detail , where the initial state may be a ( coherent ) superposition of ( i ) the atom being in the upper state and the body  field system being in the ground state and",
    "( ii ) the atom being in the lower state and the body  field system being in a single - quantum excited state . on the basis of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) in linearly",
    "responding media , we aim at generalizing the theory with two respects .",
    "firstly , we allow for an arrangement of bodies of arbitrary shape and material which are characterized by their space- and frequency - dependent complex permittivity and permeability , thus accounting for both material absorption and dispersion in a natural way .",
    "the spectral and spatial structure of the body - assisted field follows from the green tensor of the associated macroscopic maxwell equations , thus generalizing the idealized case of a single perfect standing wave in a cavity to more realistic systems .",
    "secondly , we include the nontrivial temporal evolution of both the state of the system and the cp force in the theory by developing a dynamical approach to the cp force .",

    "<S> based on macroscopic quantum electrodynamics in linear media , we develop a general theory of the resonant casimir  polder force on an excited two - level atom in the presence of arbitrary linear bodies , with special emphasis on the strong - coupling regime where reabsorption of an emitted photon can give rise to ( vacuum ) rabi oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> we first derive a simple time - independent expression for the force by using a dressed - state approximation . for initially single - quantum excited atom  field systems we then study the dynamics of the force by starting from the lorentz force and evaluating its average as a function of time . for strong atom  </S>",
    "<S> field coupling , we find that the force may undergo damped rabi oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> the damping is due to the decay of both the atomic excitation and the field excitation , and both amplitude and mean value of the oscillations depend on the chosen initial state . </S>"
