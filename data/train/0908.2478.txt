    "in order to clarify the issue of the presence of the ss phase at @xmath25 , we numerically study the model with both the grand canonical and canonical approaches . the grand canonical calculation is carried out using the standard stochastic series expansion ( sse ) monte carlo method implemented with directed loop algorithm @xcite . while sse works on grand canonical ensemble , in order to fix the density @xmath26 we scan the chemical potential @xmath27 to find an average density @xmath28 with an uncertainty less than 0.01 .",
    "it turns out , as shown below , this method generates the same result as the gfmc . in sse , the superfluidity , given by @xmath29 ,",
    "is computed by measuring the winding number fluctuation as usual .",
    "the gfmc starts with a jastrow variational wave function which is defined by applying the density jastrow factor to a state with all the bosons condensed into the @xmath30 state @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the non - interacting boson ground state with @xmath33 particles , and @xmath34 are parameters that can be optimized to minimize the variational energy @xcite . in order to take the hard - core constraint into account , configurations with more than one boson on a single site",

    "[ wfj ] was shown to be able to turn a non - interacting bosonic state into a mott insulator if a long - range jastrow factor is included . in our recent work",
    ", we have also shown that the supersolid and solid phases can also be described in the same wave function .",
    "however , the number of the variational parameters in @xmath34 grows exponentially with the lattice size which costs a lot of computation time for an optimized wave function . instead of including parameters of all range , we use a gutzwiller projection factor @xmath36 to enhance the diagonal order .",
    "here @xmath37 is a variational parameter which controls the diagonal order specified by the sublattice @xmath38 .",
    "obviously , this factor can stabilize the solid and gives reasonably good trial energy when @xmath0 and @xmath1 are large .",
    "we found that low variational energy can be acquired for the a - type supersoild and solid without the projection factor . on the other hand , relative stable wave function",
    "is found by including the projection factor for the b - type solid .    in order to investigate the exact ground state properties ,",
    "green s function monte carlo method is employed to improve the variational results . in this work ,",
    "we choose multi - walkers stochastic reconfiguration method to prevent the simulation from blow - up or dead - ends in the large power limit .",
    "to benchmark our method we compare our gfmc data ( points ) with the exact results ( lines ) without using monte carlo for an @xmath39 lattice in fig .",

    "to further investigate the effect of quantum fluctuation of the model , we also obtain the ground state phase diagram using a simple mean field approach . a mean field wavefunction    @xmath53",

    "the agreement between both approaches is clear and verifies that our attempt to fix the boson density @xmath26 to 0.25 in the grand canonical sse does not lead to any measurable discrepancy of the physical quantities we are interested in with the canonical gfmc .",
    "the coexistence of superfluid order and star crystal structure for @xmath63 in fig.[12x12 ] ( a ) clearly signals the supersolid phase at quarter - filling .",
    "the uniform superfluid develops spatial modulation , i.e. becomes a supersolid , continuously as @xmath1 increases and gradually loses its superfluidity at the same time until it eventually becomes a star solid . to demonstrate that the supersolid ground state survives at larger lattice size and at thermodynamic limit , a finite size analysis is carried out in fig .",

    "it is remarkable that simple mf theory also correctly predicts the existence of quarter - filled ss and quantum fluctuation does not destroy the long - range orders in the ss phase , in contrast to the case of kagome lattice @xcite . except that the solid a and b phase",
    "are indistinguishable in the mf level , mf theory successfully reproduce all phases at quarter - filling as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ phase ] .    in the first glance ,",
    "the existence of a supersolid at _ commensurate _ density contradicts the notion of vacancy supersolid .",
    "prokofev and svistunov @xcite have proved that superfluidity has zero probability to occur in commensurate solids in nature , or in other words , the necessary condition for the supersolidity is the present of vacancies or defects .",
    "this is due to the asymmetry between vacancies and interstitials .",
    "however , this result , as admitted in their paper , does not apply to systems with explicitly broken translation symmetry , such as in lattice models where commensurability is enhanced by hand . in our system",
    ", the commensurability of quarter - filled supersolid can always be ensured by adjusting the chemical potential provided there is no phase separation .",
    "vacancies and interstitials ( means bosons at the sublattice sites ) arise from quantum fluctuations do not form bound pairs and are free to move away from each other that , therefore , leads to superflow .",
    "the interstitial - vacancy symmetry is generally absent in nature but is preserved in this case by the external potential that fix bosons to locate only at the lattice points .",
    "based on the measured structure factors @xmath67 ,",
    "@xmath64 , @xmath68 and boson density @xmath26 , one can easily deduce the boson densities on each sublattices .",
    "fig.[vary_mu ] shows that bosons do not localized at only one sublattice but have finite occupation in all four sublattices .",
    "the data indicates that there are more than 30 percent of vacancies in the quarter - filled supersolid and in consistent with the picture of vacancy supersolid .     and",

    "starting from small density , the ground state is an uniform superfluid in which all sublattice densities are equal .",
    "while increasing @xmath27 until quarter - filled , the system undergoes a second order phase transition to a star ss .",
    "note that although there is a small dip of superfluidity in the ss state , it does not reduce to zero even at @xmath25 .",
    "there is no any indication that @xmath25 is a special density that acquires particular treatment like the canonical calculation .",
    "furthermore , no noticeable change is observed when doubling the lattice size to 48x48 ( filled symbols in fig.[vary_mu ] ) .",
    "doping more bosons will destabilize the star ss phase because of the nnn repulsion that leads to a striped ss via a discontinuous phase transition between the two different broken translation symmetries .",
    "striped ss is also observable at @xmath25 when @xmath0 is small enough . on the other hand , while there are two kinds of star solid ( a and b phase ) , a natural question is whether ss of both kinds exist at or away from quarter - filled .",

    "it is interesting to note that at quarter - filling , the classical ground state of the frustrated hamiltonian @xmath71 is highly degenerate . translating any lines of bosons in fig .",
    "[ starsolid]a by one lattice constant of the solid a phase along , say , @xmath72 direction will create a domain wall with no energy cost . when translating alternate lines of bosons generate a b phase solid .",
    "enormous number of ways to create domain walls implies that the classical ground state has macroscopic degeneracy .",
    "this degeneracy , however , is lifted by quantum fluctuation that yields a ground state of a phase if @xmath73 or b phase otherwise .",
    "this is another typical example of the order by disorder phenomenon@xcite .",
    "as discussed in previous sections , it leads to a star ss a phase in a wide parameter range , similar to the scenario of the one - third filling ss in the frustrated triangular lattice @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the existence of star ss b phase has not been clarified . here",
    "we complete the phase diagram for larger @xmath0 where solid b phase can be stabilized at quarter - filling . fig .",
    "[ phase ] shows that , for @xmath74 , when increasing from small nnn interaction @xmath1 , the sf phase changes to the solid b phase via a first order phase transition without passing an intermediate ss b phase .",
    "star solid a phase emerges when further increasing @xmath1 until @xmath75 .",
    "furthermore we do not observe any ss b phase away from @xmath25 as shown in fig .",
    "[ b_mu ] at a representative @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "instead there is a first order phase transition from the gapped solid b phase to a uniform sf phase and implies that the ss of b phase symmetry is unstable towards phase separation .",
    "this can be understood by the simple argument of domain formation as discussed in the case of hardcore checkerboard ss @xcite .",
    "addition holes ( bosons ) in the quarter - filled solid phase b tend to line up to form a domain wall in which the gain in kinetic energy is larger than that of isolated holes ( bosons ) .",
    "the ss b phase is therefore unstable towards phase separation .     and",
    "@xmath77 . the ground state at @xmath25 is a b phase solid .",
    "doping away from @xmath25 leads to a first order phase transition to sf phase .",
    "no b phase supersolid is found.,width=264 ]",
    "we have presented a comprehensive numerical study on the extend hardcore hubbard model , in particular , on the ss phases at the quarter - filled density . based on results of the sse , gfmc and mf calculations , we provide convincing evidence for the existence of star ss a phase at exact @xmath25 , in contrasts to previous study .",
    "we clearly show that the ss a phase found at @xmath25 is consistent to the notion of vacancy ss .",
    "the star ss phase is a consequence of the order by disorder phenomenon by which the ground state degeneracy is lifted .",
    "furthermore , the physical natures the solid a and b phase are also studied .",
    "although classically degenerate , these two states compete with each other through quantum fluctuations and the final stability depends on the competition between nn ( @xmath0 ) and nnn ( @xmath1 ) interactions .",
    "we present a complete phase diagram including also the solid b phase .",
    "the ss b phase on the other hand is found unstable towards phase separation due to the kinetic energy gain of domain formation ."
