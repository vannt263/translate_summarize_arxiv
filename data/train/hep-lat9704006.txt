    "considerable progress has been achieved recently in lattice qcd as a result of combining two relatively old ideas : ( i ) improving the continuum limit behavior of the lattice action by adding terms that cancel the leading finite lattice spacing corrections ( `` symanzik improvement ''  @xcite ) and ( ii ) identifying a renormalized coupling which connects lattice perturbation theory and mc simulations  @xcite .",
    "the key observation is that the disagreement between mc results and lattice perturbation theory can , to a large extent , be attributed to scale - independent ( tadpole ) renormalizations of the bare coupling . by converting lattice perturbation expansions in the bare coupling to ones using a renormalized coupling that effectively takes these tadpole corrections into account , lattice perturbation theory with the wilson plaquette action",
    "can be reconciled with results from simulations in the scaling region  @xcite .",
    "moreover , tests of asymptotic scaling of physical quantities are much more successful when the perturbative beta function is computed using such a renormalized coupling  @xcite . at the same time",
    ", the above observation suggests a mean - field type modification of the relation between lattice links and continuum gauge fields  @xcite , which implies that the leading order coefficients of the correction terms to effect symanzik improvement have been significantly underestimated , the more so , the coarser the lattice@xcite .",
    "thus , besides improving lattice perturbation theory , the effectiveness of lattice gluodynamics simulations _ per se _ can be dramatically enhanced by working at coarse lattices and using a tadpole improved version ( henceforth referred to as `` cornell '' action  @xcite ) of the continuum limit improved action of lscher and weisz  @xcite .",
    "the effectiveness of the method can be demonstrated , e.g. , by computing the off - axis interquark potential at small @xmath1 , coarse lattices ( lattice spacing @xmath2 fm ) in su(3 ) pure gauge theory .",
    "the violation of rotational symmetry inherent in the wilson action , manifest in the @xmath3 deviation of the off - axis potential from a linear - plus - coulomb fit to the on - axis values , is reduced to @xmath4 ) using the continuum limit improved lscher - weisz action , and is essentially eliminated ( of order a few % ) by using the continuum limit plus tadpole improved action  @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we apply these ideas in su(2 ) pure gauge theory , focusing on confinement related aspects in the framework of abelian projection ( ap ) picture  @xcite . after partial gauge fixing the original su(n ) gauge symmetry",
    "is reduced to the u(1)@xmath5 largest abelian ( cartan ) subgroup . under this residual group ,",
    "diagonal gluon components transform as abelian `` photons '' , off - diagonal gluons and quarks as doubly- and singly - charged matter fields , respectively . the effective abelian theory ( apqcd ) that results from the integration over the off - diagonal gluons",
    "contains a complicated assortment of abelian wilson loop operators of various sizes and charges , which describe the dynamics of the abelian photons  @xcite , and , furthermore , mass terms for monopoles of different sizes and shapes  @xcite .",
    "these monopoles are identified as singularities in the gauge - fixing condition .",
    "the conjecture is then that condensation of these abelian monopoles leads to confinement , in the spirit of the dual superconductor confinement mechanism in compact qed  @xcite .",
    "one question that we wish to address in this work is whether the improvement of the non - abelian action leads as well to improved continuum limit behavior of the effective abelian theory resulting from the projection .",
    "we do this by computing the on- and off - axis potential from abelian wilson loops in apqcd and comparing the violation of rotational symmetry between the apqcd resulting from using the wilson action ( apqcd - w ) and apqcd resulting from using the tadpole improved action ( apqcd - i ) .",
    "we find that the off - axis abelian potential shows restoration of rotational invariance as well , allowing ( at least in principle ) to study the abelian projection in small , coarse lattices .",
    "the abelian projection is gauge - dependent .",
    "early studies  @xcite using local projections , e.g. diagonalizing an adjoint operator , did not seem to support t hooft s conjecture .",
    "one evidently successful projection is the maximal abelian ( ma )  @xcite , corresponding in the continuum to @xmath6 $ ] = 0 , where gauge field @xmath7 is decomposed in neutral(@xmath8 ) and charged(@xmath9 ) components , @xmath10 = @xmath11 + @xmath12 .",
    "one nice property of ma projection is that the abelian monopole density is consistent with asymptotic scaling behavior in both three  @xcite and four  @xcite dimensional su(2 ) , which suggests it may be a physical quantity .",
    "however , the evidence in four dimensions is not indisputable , essentially because of the lack of a dimensionful parameter in pure gauge qcd@xmath13 . scaling",
    "behavior has not been observed in other projections .",
    "thus , the second issue that we wish to address is whether renormalized perturbation theory and tadpole improvement allow to make more conclusive tests of asymptotic scaling of the monopole density .",
    "we first use renormalized perturbation theory to reanalyze the results which have been obtained with the wilson action . in agreement with su(3 )",
    "results  @xcite and also with earlier su(2 ) analyses  @xcite using the `` energy '' scheme coupling , the asymptotic scaling behavior of the string tension shows remarkable improvement when using the `` potential '' scheme renormalized coupling  @xcite . in the case of the monopole density , however , although we do find that the degree of scaling violation is reduced when the renormalized coupling is used , asymptotic scaling is clearly violated for lattice spacings @xmath14 fm , independently of the coupling ( bare or renormalized ) used .",
    "we also find evidence for ( non asymptotic ) scaling of the monopole density against the string tension , which clearly breaks down for @xmath14 fm , as well .",
    "we then study the string tension of the improved theory ( qcd - i ) and the monopole density in its abelian projection ( apqcd - i ) .",
    "we find deviations from scaling to be typically of the same order of magnitude as with the wilson action .",
    "monopole properties are also similar with those in the projected wilson theory . in particular",
    ", we see a small scaling window for the monopole density in ma gauge setting in at @xmath15 where the lattice spacing is quite small @xmath16 fm , and that only for relatively large lattices ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "we also find good evidence for ( non - asymptotic ) scaling of the monopole density , although not at coarse lattices .",
    "thus , the improvement programme reveals that the monopole definition is plagued by certain lattice artifacts that do not allow to work at coarse lattices .",
    "a final objective of this work is to shed some light on the issue of gauge dependence of the abelian projection , along the spirit of previous work  @xcite in three dimensions .",
    "there , it was shown that the difference between ma and local projections can be attributed to highly - correlated short distance fluctuations .",
    "confinement , being a large - scale phenomenon , should be oblivious to such fluctuations .",
    "it was shown that by considering monopoles defined non - locally on the lattice ( extended monopoles ) such fluctuations are averaged over , resulting in a converging behavior between ma and local gauges . in the last part of this work , we apply similar considerations in the four dimensional theory , using the tadpole improved action .",
    "we find a similar converging behavior of the density of extended monopoles between ma and f12 gauge as a function of the lattice size @xmath18 of the extended cube used to define the extended monopoles .",
    "the weakening of gauge - dependence at large physical scales is also demonstrated by showing that the density of extended monopoles in physical units forms a universal ( independent of the lattice size of the extended monopole and the projection ) trajectory as a function of their size in physical units .",
    "these results allow some optimism that the large - scale dynamics of the abelian projection may after all be independent of the specific gauge used to implement it .",

    "+ in that respect , the merit of the tadpole - improvement program ( in the form of , first , renormalized perturbation theory , and second , tadpole - improving the action itself ) , insofar as abelian monopoles are concerned , has been to point out that the asymptotic scaling behavior of the string tension can be extended to coarser lattices , while that of the monopole density can not , something that  due to the lack of asymptotic scaling with wilson action and with the bare coupling  could not have been previously realized .",
    "to further clarify some of the above points , more accurate determinations of the string tension with the improved action using anisotropic lattices ( following ref .",
