    "the paper is organized as follows . in  [ sec : obs ] we present the data and describe the analysis techniques . in  [ sec : overall ] we discuss gross features of the x - ray spectrum , including the intrinsic continuum form and interpret the data in the context of historical , lower spectral resolution ccd data . in  [ sec : features ] we qualitatively discuss the discrete x - ray spectral features before describing detailed spectral modeling . in  [ sec : modelling ] we describe in detail the modeling of the x - ray spectrum using the photoionization code , xstar . in  [ sec : compare ] we compare our results with those from other x - ray observations of ngc  4593 . in  [ sec : dust ] we discuss the possibility of a dusty warm absorber in ngc  4593 and we investigate the relativistically broadened disk - line scenario ( branduardi - raymont _ et al .",

    "[ sec : results ] we summarize our results and in  [ sec : conclusions ] briefly state our conclusions .",
    "we observed ngc  4593 with _ chandra _ ( simultaneously with _ rxte _ ) on 2001 june 29 for a duration of @xmath24  ks , beginning at ut 00:54:49 .",
    "chandra _ data were reprocessed using ciao 2.1.3 and caldb version 2.7 , according to recipes described in ciao 2.1.3 threads .",
    "the _ rxte _",
    "pca data were reduced using methods described in weaver , krolik , & pier ( 1998 ) , except improved background subtraction was utilized ( released 2002 , february ) and a later version of the spectral response matrix ( v 8.0 ) was used .",
    "only data from layer 1 and from pcus 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 were used ( pcu0 has had technical problems in the later part of the mission ) .    for _ chandra _ the instrument used in the focal plane of the high resolution mirror assembly was the _ hetgs _ .",
    "the _ hetgs _ consists of two grating assemblies , a high - energy grating ( heg ) and a medium - energy grating ( meg ) . only the summed ,",
    "negative and positive , first - order _ chandra _ grating spectra were used in our analyis .",
    "for further discussion of the _ hetgs _ and our analysis procedure here , see yaqoob _",
    "the mean _ chandra _ total heg and meg count rates were @xmath25 and @xmath26 cts / s respectively .",
    "heg , meg and pca spectra were extracted over the entire on - time for each instrument .",
    "this resulted in net exposure times of 78,889 s for heg and meg , and between @xmath27  ks and @xmath28  ks for each pcu .",
    "the background subtracted spectra from the different pcus were co - added for analysis and the resulting mean count rate was 4.8 ct / s over the entire pca band .",
    "the excess variances on the hardness ratios 1.02.5 kev/(0.61.0 kev ) and 2.57.0 kev/(0.61.0 kev ) for _ chandra _ data binned at @xmath29 were @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively .",
    "thus , the data are consistent with no spectral variability in soft x - rays during the observation , but there may be some small spectral variation in hard x - rays .",
    "the _ rxte _",
    "observation extended @xmath32  ks beyond the _ chandra _ observation but the mean count rate in that portion of the observation was compatible with the mean of the strictly overlapping portion .",
    "therefore , for the sake of improved statistics , the pca spectrum included @xmath33  ks exposure beyond the _ chandra _ data .",
    "for _ chandra _ _ hetgs _ we made effective area files ( arf , or _",
    "ancillary response file _ ) , photon spectra and counts spectra following the method of yaqoob _ et al . _",
    "since the meg soft x - ray response is much better than the heg ( whose bandpass only extends down to @xmath34 kev ) we will use the meg as the primary instrument but refer to the heg for confirmation of features in the overlapping bandpass and for constraining the continuum .",
    "the meg spectral resolution corresponds to fwhm velocities of @xmath35 , and 3,560  @xmath36 at observed energies of 0.5 , 1.0 , and 6.4 kev respectively .",
    "we did not subtract detector or x - ray background since it is such a small fraction of the observed counts ( @xmath37 for the meg ) .",
    "we treated the statistical errors on both the photon and counts spectra with particular care since the lowest and highest energies of interest can be in the poisson regime , with spectral bins often containing a few , or even zero counts .",
    "we assign statistical upper and lower errors of @xmath38 and @xmath39 ^ 3)$ ] respectively ( from gehrels , 1986 ) on the number of photons , @xmath40 , in a given spectral bin .",
    "statistical errors were always computed on numbers of photons in final bins , according to the above prescription for plotting purposes . when fitting the _",
    "data , we used the @xmath41statistic ( cash , 1976 ) for finding the best - fitting model parameters , and quote 90@xmath42 confidence , one - parameter statistical errors unless otherwise stated .",
    "the @xmath41statistic minimization algorithm is inherently poissonian and so makes no use of the errors on the counts in the spectral bins described above .    for the heg data ,",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio per @xmath43 bin is @xmath44 blueward of @xmath45 and as high as @xmath33 in the @xmath46 range . for the meg data , in the @xmath47 band which we examine here , the signal - to - noise ratio per @xmath43 bin ranged from @xmath48 at @xmath49 to a maximum of @xmath27 at @xmath50 . the systematic uncertainty in the energy scale is currently believed to be @xmath51 and @xmath52 for the heg and meg respectively .",
    "for the meg , at 0.5 kev , 1 kev and 6.4 kev this corresponds to velocity offsets of @xmath53 , 133 , and 852  @xmath36 respectively , and about half of these values for the heg .",
    "in addition , there has been a continuous degradation of the quantum efficiency of _ chandra _ acis due to molecular contamination .",
    "the degradation includes an excess absorption due to neutral o. when fitting photoionization models to the data we will investigate the effect of this degradation on model parameters .",
    "there is no satisfactory correction available for the gratings but we will estimate worst case effects using a pure acis correction , since a grating in front of the ccds will not make the ccd degradation worse .",
    "indeed a grating may improve the situation by adding extra energy information .",
    "we will show in  [ sec : modelfits ] that omitting the correction only affects the inferred intrinsic continuum and does not affect the important physical parameters of absorption models .",
    "we used xspec v11.2.0 for spectral fitting to the heg and meg spectra in the 0.85 kev and 0.55 kev bands respectively .",
    "these energy bands will be used in all the spectral fitting in the present paper , in which we concentrate on features in the soft x - ray spectrum ( less than @xmath54 kev ) . the harder spectrum out to @xmath55 15 kev , including the fe - k emission line and compton - reflection continuum ( using simultaneous _ rxte _",
    "data in addition to the _ chandra _ data ) will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "however , we will utilize a portion of the _ rxte _ pca spectrum to constrain the continuum for fitting the soft x - ray _ chandra _ data and use the @xmath56 statistic for minimization .",
    "since we convolve all models through the instrument response before comparing with the data , all our model line - widths are intrinsic values and do not need to be corrected for the instrument broadening .",
    "this contrasts with the analysis method in some of the literature on results from grating data in which models are fitted directly to the data and _ then _ corrected for instrument broadening ( e.g. kaspi _ et al .",
    "first , we show how the 0.55 kev meg data compare to a simple model consisting only of a single power law and galactic absorption . for the latter ,",
    "we use a value of @xmath57 ( elvis _ et al .",
    "_ 1989 ) throughout this work .",
    "later in this paper we show that the acis degradation discussed above does not effect our results .",
    "therefore we do not let the galactic column vary in spectral fitting since its systematic error is much less than the effects of acis degradation .",
    "1 ( a ) shows the meg photon spectrum of ngc  4593 binned at @xmath58 ( which is comparable with _",
    "asca _ resolution ) with the model overlaid .",
    "the power - law index was allowed to vary in this fit .",
    "1 ( b ) shows the ratio of the data to this model .",
    "this simple power law is clearly a poor fit to the data , with considerable complexity apparent , both in the continuum , and in terms of discrete absorption features .",
    "1 ( b ) clearly shows a soft x - ray excess , rising up from the hard power law ( modified by galactic absorption ) , below @xmath59 .",
    "we caution that there may still be broad residual uncertainties of @xmath60 or more in the calibration of the meg effective area at the lowest energies .",
    "the instrumental effective area is very small at these energies , although residuals at @xmath61 kev probably coincide with the complex instrumental o   edge which is spread over @xmath55 10 ev around @xmath62 kev .",
    "observations of ngc  4593 in 1994 with _ asca _ ,",
    "as summarized in reynolds ( 1997 ) and george _ et al . _",
    "( 1998 ) also indicated a soft excess present below @xmath63 kev , relative to an extrapolation of the best - fitting hard x - ray power - law .",
    "a soft excess has also been observed by _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ _ letgs _ ( kaastra _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 ) , as well as by _ bepposax _ ( guainazzi _ et al .",
    "this would suggest that at least part of the soft excess we observed with _",
    "_ hetgs _ is real .",
    "the low - energy degradation of the ccds mentioned in  [ sec : obs ] is in fact in the sense that any soft excess will actually be larger when the correction is taken into account .",
    "the origin of the soft excess is unclear",
    ". it may be the tail end of some kind of soft thermal emission ( or comptonized soft thermal emission ) , possibly from an accretion disk ( e.g. see piro , matt , & ricci ( 1997 ) , and references therein ) .",
    "any relativistically - broadened o  viii  ly@xmath2 ( @xmath4 ) emission that is present could also contribute to the soft excess ( e.g. branduardi - raymont _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 ; turner _ et al .",
    "since the soft excess appears only in the 0.51 kev band of our data , we do not have enough information to constrain its origin , and sophisticated modeling of it is not warranted .",
    "therefore , in the remainder of this paper we model the 0.55 kev intrinsic continuum with a broken power law .",
    "when the data are modeled with this continuum , there is still considerable structure in the soft x - ray spectrum , characteristic of the presence of a photoionized , or ` warm ' absorber .",
    "now , the warm absorber in ngc  4593 and other agn when observed with ccds ( such as those on _ asca _ ) has often been modeled simply with absorption edges due to o  vii and o  viii since the lower ccd spectral resolution did not usually warrant more sophisticated models . in order to directly compare the new _ chandra _ data with previous observations we modeled the meg data for ngc  4593 with two absorption edges , galactic absorption , and the intrinsic continuum described above .",
    "here we used the _ rxte _ pca data to help constrain the continuum .",
    "first , we modeled the heg , meg , and pca data simultaneously , the latter data only covering the 38 kev band in order to avoid the compton - reflection continuum .",
    "we had to include an additional gaussian model component ( with center energy , width and intensity allowed to vary ) to model the fe - k line .",
    "since we are not concerned with the fe - k line in this paper we then take the hard power - law index ( @xmath64 ) from this fit and _ use @xmath65 in all subsequent model - fitting in this paper_. if we allow @xmath66 to vary in our best model ( two absorption edges , a warm absorber and a broken power - law , see  [ sec : results ] below ) fit to the _ chandra _ meg data binned at 0.16@xmath67 , we find a best - fitting value of @xmath68 which is consistent with the fixed value above , so fixing @xmath66 does not affect our results or conclusions . since we will only be using _",
    "data below 5 kev from this point on , we do not have to worry about the spectral fits becoming unstable due to too much interplay between the two parts of the broken power - law index and the fe - k line model .",
    "this will be dealt with in future work .    in order to measure the absorption - edge parameters",
    ", we then modeled the 0.55 kev meg data only , fixing the hard photon index at 1.794 , and allowed the energies and optical depths ( at threshold ) of the two absorption edges to vary .",
    "the best - fitting model overlaid on the meg photon spectrum is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "although a spectrum with bin size @xmath69 was used for the spectral fitting , the plot shows the data binned at @xmath58 since this is closer to the resolution of ccd data .",
    "the best - fitting parameters obtained from this model were @xmath70 kev and @xmath71 kev for the edge threshold energies .",
    "for the the optical depths at threshold we obtained @xmath72 and @xmath73 respectively .",
    "all quantities refer to the source rest frame .",
    "the best - fitting soft x - ray photon index was @xmath74 and the break energy was @xmath75 kev .",
    "the edge at 0.868 kev is in good agreement with the expected energy of the o  viii edge at 0.871 kev .",
    "however , the edge at 0.708 kev is redshifted by @xmath76 km @xmath1 from the expected energy of the o  vii edge ( 0.739 kev ) . rather , this edge energy agrees extremely well with the expected energy of a neutral fe l3-edge at 0.707 kev ( as observed , for example , by lee",
    "_ et al . _",
    "( 2001 ) in the warm absorber of mcg  @xmath776@xmath7730@xmath7715 ) .",
    "furthermore , adding a _ third _ edge to the continuum model , with a threshold energy fixed at that expected for o  vii , does not improve the fit statistic significantly .",
    "the threshold optical depth of the o  vii edge in this case is @xmath78 at the one - parameter , @xmath79 confidence level .",
    "we note that since the spectrum is so complex around the regions of the o  vii and o  viii edges , optical depths derived from simple models should be interpreted with caution .",
    "we can compare the threshold optical depths with those measured from the 1994 january 4 _ asca _ observation of ngc  4593 ( reynolds 1997 ) : @xmath80 ( ascribed to o  vii ) and @xmath81 ( o  viii ) .",
    "chandra _ and _ asca _ o  viii edge depths are in marginal agreement but the o  vii depths are completely incompatible .",
    "it seems that , due to the limited energy resolution of ccd data , the fe - l3 edge was misidentified with an o  vii edge , not only in ngc  4593 but possibly also for other agn .",
    "the high resolution of _ chandra _ _ hetgs _ indicates that this edge _ can not _ be due to o  vii , and previous _ asca _ data from agn needs to be re - examined in this context .",
    "the optical depth that we measure for the fe - l3 edge is in marginal agreement with that ascribed to the o  vii edge by reynolds ( 1997 ) .",
    "the _ asca _ sis ( 4-ccd mode ) observation of ngc  4593 had an energy resolution ( fwhm ) of @xmath82 ev at @xmath83 kev at the time of the observation , and therefore could not distinguish between an o  vii edge and a neutral fe edge .",
    "however , an fe - l edge for the feature at 0.7 kev is not the only interpretation ( see  [ sec : dust ] ) .",
    "high resolution observations with _",
    "chandra _ are also hinting at x - ray absorption fine structure ( xaf ) around absorption edges ( lee _ et al .",
    "the apparent fe - l edge in our data extends over @xmath84 ev , which is @xmath85 times the fwhm resolution of _ chandra _ at this energy .",
    "the s / n of our data and the fwhm resolution of _ chandra _ are not adequate to measure the xaf structure around the fe - l edge , which in any case , will be complicated by o  vii @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) absorption features .",
    "in order to best illustrate different characteristics of the spectrum we display the spectral data in several different ways . in fig .  3 we show the meg photon spectrum between 0.472.1 kev , as a function of observed energy . the data and the models in fig .",
    "3 are all absorbed by the galactic column density . an important point to realize from fig .",
    "3 is that in some regions the spectrum is so complex that it is difficult to distinguish absorption from emission .",
    "for example , two emission features may be present between 1.01.5 kev according to the data / model ratio plot of fig .  2 .",
    "however , from fig .  3 it is clear that the peak flux of both features coincides with the inferred intrinsic continuum , implying that the apparent feature is simply due to the presence of broad absorption complexes on either side of it .",
    "in addition there is a sharp variation in the meg effective area ( at @xmath88 kev ) and any uncertainties in the response could be manifested as an apparent spectral feature ( see  [ sec : modelling ] for further discussion ) .    in fig .  4 and fig .  5",
    "we show the meg spectrum , this time as a function of wavelength in the source rest - frame , redward of @xmath89 .",
    "these spectra have bin sizes of @xmath43 , approximately the fwhm meg spectral resolution ( @xmath90 ) . in fig .",
    "4 we overlay the lyman series ( blue ) for h - like n , o , ne , mg , si , s , ar and the corresponding he - like triplets ( red ) that lie in the 2 - 25@xmath67 range . in fig .  5 we overlay the he - like resonance series lines ( blue ) to the @xmath91 level for the same elements .",
    "in addition , in fig .  5 we indicate l - shell transitions of fe  xix ( red ) in the @xmath92 range to illustrate just some of the blending of spectral features that can arise due to absorption by highly ionized fe .    referring to figs . 3 to 5 , we see that the strongest , clear discrete spectral features detected are absorption lines due to o  viii  ly@xmath2 ( @xmath4 ) , o  viii  ly@xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) , ne  ix ( r ) @xmath9 ( @xmath95 ) , ne  ix ( r ) @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) , ne  x  ly@xmath2 ( @xmath98 ) , mg  xii  ly@xmath2 ( @xmath5 ) , si  xiii ( r ) @xmath9 ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "also included amongst the strongest discrete features are transitions ( and blends of transitions ) which we identify with highly ionized fe , typically l - shell transitions in fe  xx fe  xxv .",
    "weaker absorption lines are also apparent from the spectra such as n  vii  ly@xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) , o  vii ( r ) @xmath9 ( @xmath100 ) and higher - order lyman and ( he - like ) resonance absorption lines of o and ne ( there is evidence for transitions up to @xmath101 in each case ; see figs . 4 and 5 ) .",
    "some of these weaker features may be blended with fe  xxii - fe  xxiii transitions .",
    "higher signal - to - noise x - ray spectroscopy ( e.g. of ngc  3783 , kaspi _ et al .",
    "_ 2002 ) has shown that blending of absorption features considerably complicates the spectrum .",
    "in particular , transitions of fe  xxiii could be blended with the absorption troughs at @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "similarly , transitions of fe  xx and fe  xxii could be blended with troughs at @xmath104 , and @xmath105 respectively .",
    "we note that such a wide range of observed ionization states ( from n  vii to fe  xxv ) suggests that there is more than one ionization component of the warm absorber .",
    "we shall return to this point in the discussion of photoionization modeling in  [ sec : modelling ] .",
    "we also identify absorption features due to o  vii ( r ) @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) and n  vii  ly@xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) in the observed frame , at @xmath106 , indicating absorption along the line of sight due to a hot medium in our galaxy or local group ( see also figs . 3 , 4 & 5 ) .",
    "the separations of the lines at @xmath106 and @xmath14 is 2490 km @xmath1 , which is easily resolved by _",

    "( 2002 ) suggest that the local absorption is produced in a low density intergalactic plasma , collapsing towards our galaxy .",
    "it is likely that the @xmath106 absorption features o  vii ( r ) @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) and n  vii  ly@xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) in ngc  4593 are due to the same gas .",
    "the strengths of the lines , although only marginally significant , are comparable with the ew@xmath108 ev detected by nicastro _",
    "( 2002 ) .",
    "apart from fe  k@xmath2 ( which will be discussed elsewhere ) , we also identify weak [ o  vii ] and [ ne  ix ] emission features .",
    "table  1 shows that [ o  vii ] and [ ne  ix ] are redshifted but the errors are consistent with systemic velocity .",
    "the corresponding intercombination and resonance lines of the o  vii and ne  ix he - like triplets are not detected .",
    "the relative prominence of forbidden lines compared to the intercombination and resonance lines indicates an origin in a photoionized plasma ( e.g. porquet & dubau 2000 ) .",
    "6 shows close - ups of the wavelength regions spanning the o  vii and ne  ix he - like triplets ( with the positions of the forbidden ( f ) , intercombination ( i ) and resonance ( r ) lines marked in red ) .",
    "the ratio of the forbidden and intercombination line fluxes ( r = f / i ) constrains the electron density ( e.g. see porquet & dubau 2000 ) .",
    "an estimate of r from the flux at the i , f wavelengths in fig .  6 yields r@xmath1093 for ne  ix and r@xmath10910 for o  vii .",
    "these ratios imply @xmath110 and @xmath111 respectively , for a relative ionic abundance of the h - like and he - like ions of @xmath112 ( see fig.9 of porquet & dubau 2000 ) .",
    "if blending is significant in either of these triplets , then the measured line intensities would be upper limits only , thereby yielding a potentially significant systematic error to our estimates of r and therefore @xmath113 .",
    "the presence of broad , bound - free absorption features and many narrow features which may be blended , makes it impossible to define an observed continuum for much of the spectrum , and therefore it is difficult to measure meaningful equivalent widths of even the strongest narrow absorption features . rather than try to measure equivalent widths of _ all _ candidate features , and compare with model predictions , we will take the physically more direct approach of fitting photoionization models to the data (  [ sec : modelling ] ) .",
    "first we give the measured energies and equivalent widths of the strongest absorption lines .",
    "the measurements were made using the broken power law plus two - edge model as the baseline spectral model ( see  [ sec : overall ] ) and gaussians to model the absorption lines .",
    "the continuum and edge parameters were frozen at the best - fitting values given in ",
    "[ sec : overall ] , and the data were fitted over a few hundred ev centered on the feature of interest . allowing the edge parameters to vary did not change our results .",
    "the fitted range of the data was extended down to 0.47 kev in order to measure the parameters of n  vii  ly@xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "initially the _ intrinsic _ width of each gaussian was frozen at less than the instrumental resolution but then allowed to vary in order to investigate whether the lines were resolved .",
    "the results for the measured energies , apparent velocity shifts relative to systemic , equivalent widths , intrinsic widths and the improvement in the fit - statistic , of these strongest absorption features are given in table  1 .",
    "note that the quoted equivalent widths are relative to the _ intrinsic _ continuum ( corrected for galactic absorption ) .",
    "again , we caution that the measured equivalents widths are subject to uncertainties in the continuum , line - blending , and any complexity in the line profile .",
    "it is instructive to compare line strengths with a physical model , so also in table  1 are the predicted equivalent widths from the best - fitting photoionization model discussed in  [ sec : modelling ] .",
    "table  1 shows that most of the measured absorption lines are blueshifted , with gaussian - fitted centroids ranging from near systemic velocity to @xmath114310 km @xmath1 .",
    "the exceptions are ne  ix ( r ) @xmath9 ( @xmath95 ) and fe  xx ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "the former is redshifted , but the measurement is consistent with systemic velocity and the latter is likely blended with nearby fe  xx transitions ( see below ) .",
    "some of the velocity profiles of the absorption features in table  1 appear to be more complex than gaussian , as can be seen from an inspection of the profiles in fig .  7 and fig .",
    "these velocity profiles were obtained from combined heg and meg data except for those transitions at @xmath116 , which were determined using meg data only , since they are out of the heg bandpass .",

    "we computed grids with @xmath113 in the range @xmath139 . for xstar models of the _ absorber _ , we confirmed that results from fitting the photoionization models to the x - ray data were indistinguishable for densities in the range @xmath140 to @xmath141 .",
    "hereafter we will use @xmath142 unless otherwise stated .",
    "different density models will be important when we come to model the emission lines .",

    "therefore , to calculate model equivalent widths correctly one must know what the velocity width is ( note that the @xmath143-value could represent all sources of line - broadening ) . we can not simply extend the xstar model grids into another dimension ( velocity width ) , and deduce a @xmath143-value directly from model - fitting , because we are limited by the finite internal energy resolution of xstar .",

    "our choice of velocity width ( @xmath143-value corresponding to the thermal width ) ensures that the energy resolution of xstar is the limiting factor and not the @xmath143-value itself .",
    "we will then need to take a rather more complicated approach to model - fitting ( described in  [ sec : modelfits ] below ) and deduce a b - value appropriate for the data .",

    "the intrinsic continuum was a broken power law ( the hard photon index again fixed at 1.794 ) modified by absorption from photoionized gas ( derived from seda , which has a prominent bump in the ir - uv region , see  [ sec : sed ] ) and the galaxy , as well as an absorption edge due to neutral fe in the rest - frame of ngc  4593 . excluding overall normalizations",

    "our model - fitting strategy is more complicated than simply comparing the xstar model spectra with the data since the xstar spectra assume a certain line width ( @xmath143-value ) , which itself is limited by the finite internal energy resolution of xstar .",
    "we chose @xmath150 in order that the energy resolution of xstar is the limiting factor .",
    "the result is that the equivalent widths of lines in the xstar spectra need to be calculated more rigorously using a line width ( @xmath143-value ) appropriate for the data . on the other hand ,",
    "the ionic columns in the xstar models are robust from this point - of - view and do not depend on the velocity width .",
    "therefore , after finding the best - fitting ionization parameter and warm - aborber column density from a global fit using the model described above , in   [ sec : comparison ] we will deduce a @xmath143-value from a curve - of - growth analysis , using ionic column densities from the best - fitting global model .",

    "we found that a photoionization model based on sedb ( the sed without a prominent bump in fig .",
    "9 ) yielded best - fit parameters within the @xmath79 errors given above ( @xmath157 for no additional parameters ) . only a small difference in results between seda and sedb",
    "should be expected since the relevant ionizing continuum is mainly in the x - ray band .",

    "this offset is marginally less than the offset due to uncertainty in the meg energy scale ( 5.5m@xmath67 ) .",
    "we mentioned in ",
    "[ sec : overall ] that the 2.02.5 kev region in the _ chandra _ spectra suffers from systematics as large as @xmath162 in the effective area due to limitations in the calibration of the x - ray telescope absorption edges in that region .",
    "we therefore omitted the 2.02.5 kev regions of the _ chandra _ spectra during the spectral fitting so that the fits would not be unduly biased . these and other instrumental features can be seen in the upper panel of fig .  10 .",
    "all the meg data in the 0.55 kev band are shown here , although the 2.02.5 kev region was omitted during spectral fitting .",
    "other regions which have sharp changes in the effective area also show notable mismatches between data and model , but these are not as bad as in the 2.02.5 kev region .",
    "the acis ccds have been undergoing a continuous low - energy qe degradation , probably due to absorption by a cumulative build - up of contaminants .",
    "unfortunately , at the time of writing , there is no correction available for grating data .",
    "there is however , a model of the contamination pertinent for pure acis data ( without the gratings ) .",
    "we can use this model as a ` worst case ' to estimate the effects on our photoionization modeling and conclusions .",
    "thus , we repeated the spectral fitting described above with the addition of the acis qe degradation model in xspec v11.2 ( acisabs ) , using the defaults for absorption by the contaminants c , h , o , and n in the ratio 10:20:2:1 by number of atoms .",
    "remarkably , we found that the best - fitting @xmath145 , @xmath158 and their associated statistical errors , were essentially indistinguishable from those obtained without the contamination model .",
    "what changed was the soft photon index , which increased to @xmath163 .",
    "even the break energy remained essentially the same .",
    "thus , our photoionization modeling is driven by the discrete , narrow absorption features in ngc  4593 and is therefore robust to broadband calibration uncertainties . to determine why the degradation model did not change @xmath145 or @xmath132 , we simulated data consisting of an absorbed power  law continuum with and without degradation respectively .",
    "we then fitted the data with and without the acisabs model .",
    "we found that when the simulated spectrum with no degradation was fitted with acisabs , @xmath145 did not increase , but the continuum steepened .",
    "this is because the degradation yields deep absorption edges which are not in the simulated data .",
    "we conclude that the real data have much less degradation than is assumed by the acisabs degradation model .      in order to determine the correct velocity width ( @xmath143-value ) of absorption lines for our models , we calculated curves - of - growth for different values of @xmath143 ( see fig .",
    "the theoretical curves - of - growth in fig .  13 indicate that the measured equivalent widths of @xmath164 are most consistent with @xmath165 km @xmath1 .",

    "most of the measurements are consistent with @xmath166  @xmath36 within errors .",

    "however , all of the other strong absorption features on fig .",
    "13 seem to be consistent with the curves of growth .",
    "one explanation for the discrepancy might be an absorber component consisting of highly ionized dust . from  [ sec : overall ] we have seen that the data are consistent with an overabundance of neutral fe , likely bound up in dust along the line - of - sight .",
    "the dust that lies closest to the agn may well be highly ionized , contributing to a larger o  vii column than expected from a simple single zone photoionization model .",

    "thus , in spite of the likely wide range of ionization states in the warm absorbing gas , a single - component photoionization model can give surprisingly good fits to the principal absorption lines .",
    "there are many more discrete absorption features apparent in the spectra but with lower signal - to - noise .",
    "although these individual weak features can not be studied in detail we can at least check whether the best - fitting xstar model does not conflict with the data .",

    "we investigated the robustness of the xstar model fits to the absorption features by examining the data versus model at the extremes of the @xmath145 versus @xmath132 confidence intervals ( see fig .",

    "then we can examine the data and model spectra in detail for each of these new fits to see where the model and data deviate significantly from each other .",
    "we found that the models were still able to account for the strengths of all of the strong absorption - line features ( listed in table  1 ) for pairs of @xmath145 and @xmath132 lying inside the 99@xmath42 confidence contour . on the other hand ,",
    "for pairs of @xmath145 and @xmath132 lying outside the 99@xmath42 contour we found that absorption lines in the 12 - 15@xmath67 range were particularly sensitive and the equivalent width would be over - predicted or under - predicted by as much as a factor of two .",

    "12 are a good guide to the allowed range of @xmath145 and @xmath132 .    as well as absorption , the xstar code also calculates emission spectra .",
    "however , the very weak [ ne  ix ] and [ o  vii ] forbidden lines that we observe ( see fig .  6 ) can not constrain the xstar emission spectra . therefore our best - fit photoionization model of the warm absorbing gas ( fig .  11 ) does not warrant inclusion of the corresponding ( weak ) emission spectrum .",

    "we note from fig .  1 in kaastra & steenbrugge ( 2001 ) ( which shows counts spectra versus observed wavelength between 18 - 23@xmath67 ) , that the _ chandra _ _ letgs _ spectrum does exhibit some absorption features .",

    "the presence of the [ o  vii ] emission line in the _ xmm - newton _ rgs1 data and its absence in the _ chandra _ _ letgs _ data from a year later , suggests that the o  vii emission region lies within 1 light year of the source of the continuum radiation .",
    "the [ o  vii ] emission feature likely originates in a photoionized plasma and the reduction in its intensity over the year between the _ xmm - newton _ rgs observation and the _ chandra _ _ letgs _ observation is consistent with the halving of the mean flux from this source in that time .",

    "when we replaced the o  viii  ly@xmath2 ( @xmath4 ) emission from around a schwarzschild black hole with the corresponding emission from around a maximally spinning kerr hole , we found that the c - statistic _ worsened _ by @xmath216 relative to the schwarzschild disk line , for the same number of parameters . the best fitting inclination angle and equivalent width were @xmath217 degrees and @xmath218 ev respectively .",
    "we assumed the same radial emissivity law but extended the inner radius down to 1.24 gravitational radii .",
    "the kerr disk line _ can not fit the data around 0.7 kev _ because the blue wing of the kerr disk line , being strongly broadened , is less sharp and ` edge - like ' than that of the schwarzschild disk line .",
