    "close to a trajectory with @xmath367 the piecewise continuous @xmath102 maps defined in ( [ maps - negative ] ) are smooth , whereas close to a trajectory with @xmath366 the maps exhibit rapid changes and ( vertical ) cusp - like features . as a result ,",
    "determining negative value(s ) of @xmath52 is more challenging  despite resolving @xmath282 to machine precision ( approximately @xmath368 in the standard ieee double precision ) , it is not possible to approximate the value of @xmath369 sufficiently well that an accurate estimate of @xmath370 can be determined .",
    "in these cases , we therefore found it necessary to implement one additional stage in the numerical scheme as follows .",
    "once @xmath369 had been determined up to machine precision , and two ` limiting ' trajectories had been identified ( one emanating from @xmath371 and terminating at @xmath352 , and the other emanating from @xmath372 and terminating at @xmath351 , where @xmath373 ) the expected near - field linear asymptotic behaviour of @xmath374 , according to the expansion ( [ center - manifold - zero - asymptotics ] ) for the solution @xmath53 in theorem [ theorem - center - manifold - zero ] , is clearly visible .",
    "this linear behaviour can then be extrapolated , in the direction of decreasing @xmath120 , until it intersects the @xmath120-axis .",
    "this intersection point is , to a good approximation , the value of @xmath370 corresponding to the trajectory emanating from @xmath369 .",
    "panel ( a ) of figure [ example - shooting ] gives an example of the linear extrapolation procedure described above .",
    "using the procedure described above , for all values of @xmath59 , we recover the trivial solution discussed in proposition [ lemma - exact ] .",
    "in addition , we see that in the case @xmath375 there is only one suitable non - trivial solution with the following data : @xmath376 for @xmath377 and @xmath378 , similar results are observed with one trivial and only one non - trivial solution as follows : @xmath379 and @xmath380 contrastingly , in the case @xmath60 we find that three suitable non - trivial solutions exist with the data : @xmath381   x_0^ * \\approx 0.137 , \\quad a_- \\approx -0.932 , \\\\*[1 mm ]   x_0^ * \\approx 0.0592 , \\quad a_- \\approx -0.546 . \\end{array }   \\right.\\ ] ] notably all values of @xmath52 for @xmath60 are negative , whereas for @xmath382 and @xmath362 they are positive .",
    "in addition to the detailed results for @xmath383 and @xmath362 shown in figure [ individual - maps ] , we also show in figure [ all - sols - negative - t ] the values of @xmath369 determined for all values of @xmath8 from @xmath14 to @xmath384 . for the primary red and blue branches , emanating from @xmath375 along the black branch ,",
    "we show the corresponding values of @xmath52 in figure [ negative - t - a - minus ] .",
    "intriguingly , the numerical results indicate that in addition to the exact solution  which is valid for all @xmath59  there are a whole host of additional solutions , some with @xmath367 , and others with @xmath366 .",

    "the numerical procedure is carried out as follows :    select a value of @xmath404 . since @xmath213 is an equilibrium point , it is not possible to escape @xmath213 in finite time .",

    "by contrast , using ( [ stable - manifold - zero ] ) and ( [ stable - manifold - zero - dynamics ] ) for @xmath407 , we find that a trajectory along the unstable manifold @xmath216 has the local asymptotic behaviour @xmath408 for a small positive value of @xmath405 .",
