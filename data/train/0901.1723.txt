    "these intriguing findings have definitively opened up the way to quantum systems based on the @xmath13-wave symmetry of high-@xmath4 superconductors .",
    "the @xmath13-wave order parameter can be used to create naturally degenerate two - level systems which can offer significant advantages for quantum computation .",
    "@xcite however , one of the main arguments against high-@xmath4 qubits based on systems with @xmath13-wave order parameter symmetry was the presence of low energy excitations , i.e. , nodal quasiparticles and zero - energy andreev bound states ( zess ) , destroying quantum coherence .",
    "recent theoretical works suggest that nodal quasiparticles and zess , respectively , give super - ohmic and ohmic dissipation on mqt .  @xcite    the ybco biepitaxial grain - boundary junctions which were used in mqt and elq experiments ,  @xcite have quite novel structure and several fascinating advantages for the coherent property over other types of high-@xmath4 junctions .",
    "first , the relative orientation of the @xmath13-wave order parameter between two ybco electrodes can be designed artificially .",

    "@xcite another important effect which was observed in elq experiments is the influence of the stray capacitance @xmath5 of the srtio@xmath1 ( sto ) substrate with a huge dielectric constant [ see fig .",
    "hence a large part of the measured capacitance is not due to the junction interface but to a distributed stray capacitance @xmath5 which in effect shunts the junction .",

    "[ ] we have theoretically investigated the @xmath20 resonant activation based on the extended circuit model , and found that the bias - current @xmath14 dependence of the resonant frequencies can be quantitatively explained by the normal modes ( upper and lower resonant mode ) of the system .",

    "<S> we investigate classical thermal activation ( ta ) and macroscopic quantum tunneling ( mqt ) for a yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2(ybco ) josephson junction coupled to an lc circuit theoretically . due to the coupling between the junction and the lc circuit , </S>",
    "<S> the macroscopic phase dynamics can be described as the escape process of a fictitious particle with an @xmath3 mass moving in a _ two - dimensional _ potential . </S>",
    "<S> we analytically calculate the escape rate including both the ta and mqt regime by taking into account the peculiar dynamical nature of the system . in addtion to large suppression of the mqt rate at zero temperature , we study details of the temperature dependece of the escape rate across a crossover region . </S>",
    "<S> these results are in an excellent agreement with recent experimental data for the mqt and ta rate in a ybco biepitaxial josephson junction . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the coupling to the lc circuit is essential in understanding the macroscopic quantum dynamics and the qubit operation based on the ybco biepitaxial josephson junctions . </S>"
