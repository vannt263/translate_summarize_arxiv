    "the method of image charges is a classical technique @xcite for electrostatic problems .",
    "its most elementary application is the problem of a point charge in a spherical cavity inside a conducting medium ( or the reciprocal problem of a point charge outside a conducting sphere ) . in 1845 , william thomson ( lord kelvin ) @xcite noticed that the vanishing - potential boundary condition of conductors can be automatically satisfied on the sphere by putting an image point charge at the kelvin point .",
    "a natural extension is the problem of a dielectric sphere inside a different dielectric background , where a single point image charge no longer works . in 1883",
    "carl neumann @xcite discovered that a point image at the kelvin point together with a line image starting from the kelvin point to infinity solves the boundary condition .",
    "this result has been independently re - derived by several authors , up to 1990s ; see the reviews @xcite for more details .",
    "more recently , the problem of a spherical cavity inside an ionic solution has been studied @xcite .",
    "it is again found that the image charge distribution consists of a point image and a line image .",
    "computational method for the line charge density has been developed which works well in the asymptotic limits @xcite that @xmath0 is either large or small , where @xmath1 is the inverse debye length , while @xmath2 is the radius of spherical cavity .",
    "the current work addresses the general case where @xmath0 is neither large nor small .",
    "the main advantage of image charge methods is to represent the effects of polarization charges in terms of point charges or line of charges , and therefore avoiding the task of numerically solving boundary value problems .",
    "this can substantially reduce the computational cost in monte carlo or molecular dynamics simulation of charged systems .",
    "further reduction of computational cost can be achieved by discretizing line images using gaussian quadratures , which effectively approximates a line charge by a few point charges .",
    "the total electrostatic energy of the system can then be represented as coulomb interaction between many point charges .",
    "most interfaces appearing in nature have irregular shapes , and the corresponding green s functions can not be represented in terms of simple distributions of image charges .",
    "hence one may rightfully argue that image charge methods have rather limited applications .",
    "the most important usage of image charge methods , however , arises in the multiscale reaction - field modeling of coulomb many body systems , where the interfaces are _ artificially introduced_. spherical interfaces are almost always used for their simplicity , and for the availability of analytic results for image charges .",
    "research along this direction is of current interest in both simulations and continuum modeling @xcite .    due to the long range nature of coulomb interaction , simulation of charged systems",
    "is highly nontrivial .",
    "a proper treatment of boundary conditions is vital in order to obtain physically meaningful results .",
    "periodic boundary conditions can remove artificial boundary effects in a self - consistent fashion and restore the translation symmetry .",
    "combined with ewald summation method @xcite , the cost of computing the total energy of the system with @xmath3 particles scale as @xmath4 .",
    "this can be further reduced to the order of @xmath5 using a mesh - based algorithm such as the particle mesh ewald or particle - particle particle - mesh ewald lattice summation techniques .",
    "the periodic images are however unphysical and may produce artifacts that obscure the real physics . besides , computational cost of ewald - type summation method is still rather prohibitive for large systems in monte carlo simulations , which limits simulation of charged systems to rather small size .",
    "the development of non - eward methods remains important topics ; see fukuda and nakamura @xcite for a recent review .",
    "an attractive alternative is to use the reaction field type of modeling , which is essentially a multi - scale strategy , schematically illustrated in figure [ schem ] . in this approach ,",
    "an artificial ( spherical ) cavity is introduced .",
    "all ions inside the cavity , together with possible mesoscopic objects such as charged proteins and colloids , are treated explicitly using microscopic model ( such as the primitive model @xcite ) together with monte carlo / molecular dynamics , while ions outside the cavity are treated implicitly using appropriate continuum theory , such as linearized poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) theory .",
    "it is known that linearized pb provides an accurate approximation to dilute electrolytes . for any charge inside the cavity ,",
    "then , we must solve the electrostatic green s function problem , where the potential satisfies poisson equation inside the cavity , and satisfies the ( linearized ) pb equation outside .",
    "the resulted green s function provides the pairwise electrostatic interaction ( the force field ) between mobile ions .",
    "this problem can be efficiently solved using the image charge method developed in this work .    in this multi - scale modeling approach",
    ", the microscopic model inside the system and the continuous theory outside the cavity really describe the same system .",
    "therefore the parameters of the poisson - boltzmann theory need to be determined self - consistently .",
    "these include the debye length and the effective dielectric constant . for dilute electrolyte",
    ", the debye length can be theoretically calculated as a function of ion densities , while the dielectric constant can be taken to be that of the solvent .",
    "some unphysical artifacts also arise because of the artificial hard wall repulsion of the cavity surface . using statistical mechanics",
    ", one can study this artifact and use extra short range interaction to compensate it .",
    "alternatively , one can also ignore the details inside a thin shell near the cavity surface of thickness 1 - 2 ion diameters . finally , to achieve the balance between efficiency and precision , the radius of cavity should be chosen to be couple of the debye length .",
    "we also note that there can be different levels of modeling inside the cavity . in the so - called hybrid",
    "implicit / explicit model @xcite , both solvent molecules and ions are treated explicitly inside the cavity .",
    "by contrast , in the so - called hybrid primitive / implicit model , the solvent inside the cavity is modeled implicitly as a dielectric medium , while the ions are treated at the level of primitive model .",
    "the reaction field model augmented by our image charge methods is therefore able to provide an accurate treatment of the electrostatic boundary conditions .",
    "its computation cost of the total energy scales as @xmath6 , where @xmath3 here is the total number of particles including all ions as well as their images . while for small systems ( with total particle number typically smaller than 1000 )",
    "this cost is manageable , for large systems , it becomes unrealistic .",
    "fortunately , the computation cost can be dramatically reduced using fast multipole based methods @xcite .",
    "the computational cost for the combined method generally scales as @xmath7 .    in this paper",
    ", we mainly focus on the image charge method for the green s function problem of these multi - scale reaction field models .",
    "the statistical mechanical foundation of these reaction field models will be discussed in a separate publication . in the remaining of this work",

    "ii ) and then use the inverse mellin transform to find the image charge representation ( sec .",
    "we further discretize the line image using method of gauss quadrature and construct an efficient numerical scheme for the computation of the reaction potential . in sec .",
