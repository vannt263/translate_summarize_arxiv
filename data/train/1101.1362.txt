    "concerted efforts were invested in order to understand the statistical behavior of soft matter systems in the presence of polyvalent ions .",
    "it became evident that such ions can behave very differently from monovalent ones @xcite .",
    "the reason lies in different strengths of electrostatic interactions between constituents of multi - component ionic solutions .",

    "until now it has been formulated explicitly for a counterion - only system  @xcite , which has been extended to a case with dielectric inhomogeneities as well  @xcite .",
    "we now make a crucial step forward ( in order to study the more realistic and experimentally relevant cases ) and formulate the sc theory for a mixture of symmetric and asymmetric electrolytes ( poly- as well as monovalent salts ) in the presence of dielectric inhomogeneities .    in order to investigate the salient features and to test our theoretical approach to highly asymmetric multicomponent coulomb systems we set ourselves to study the polyion concentration profiles and the possibility of overcharging by three widely different approaches .",
    "the first one is the _ standard ( explicit ) monte carlo ( mc ) simulation _ , which treats all ions explicitly , and will merely serve as a test for the other two approaches . in the second , _ dressed counterion approach _ , we integrate out the monovalent ion degrees of freedom by replacing the coulomb interaction between remaining charges with an effective screened debye - hckel ( dh ) interaction ( as first described in ref .",

[ fig : geom ] , comprises an impenetrable charged planar dielectric interface with surface charge density @xmath12 bathed in a mixture of monovalent 1:1 and polyvalent @xmath0:1 salts with bulk concentrations of @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",

    "we define the dielectric contrast parameter as @xmath21 the presence of a large dielectric contrast at the interface ( @xmath22 , or @xmath23 ) can lead to enhanced effects due to the presence of polyvalent counterions  @xcite .",
    "note that no overcharging would be possible if the solution consisted only of neutralizing counterions .",
    "however , this situation is expected to be modified significantly by the presence of monovalent salt , where various degrees of overcharging of the charged surface have been reported previously  @xcite .",
    "in what follows we will apply the `` dressed counterion '' approach to our model system , which was introduced recently  @xcite in a different context and was not thoroughly examined by explicit simulations .",
    "this approach is based on the fact that for _ highly asymmetric _ solutions with @xmath11 , the monovalent ions can be integrated out from the partition function and their effect is replaced by an effective (  dressed \" ) dh interaction that acts between the remaining polyions and the surface charges .",

    "this form of the effective screening parameter follows also from more general statistical mechanical grounds in the context of colloidal interactions in the presence of low concentration of salts  @xcite .",
    "it is also amended compared to the definition in our previous work in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the regime of relatively high monovalent salt concentration was of main interest .",
    "note however that the above pb equation can not properly treat polyvalent ions due to high correlation effects .",
    "we now make a crucial step , namely we only treat monovalent ions in the linearized pb sense , whereas polyvalent ions along with surface charge are considered explicitly , expressed in terms of explicit charge density @xmath34 , viz . @xmath35",
    "this linearized pb equation then leads straightforwardly to the relevant green s function or the non - homogeneous dh kernel , representing the screened dh interaction ( modified by the presence of any dielectric interfaces ) between all the remaining explicit charges after the simple salt degrees of freedom are integrated out .",

    "the first term is the usual ( homogeneous ) dh interaction in free space , and the second term is the non - homogeneous correction due to the presence of dielectric discontinuities and the inhomogeneous distribution of salt ions in the system ( leading to screening discontinuities , i.e. , no salt ions are present in the region @xmath39 @xmath40see fig .

    "the reason is again that the sc theory overestimates the counterion density near the surface , and hence predicts a smaller @xmath61 needed for achieving the overcharging .",
    "nevertheless , all three methods predict a clear and consistent trend : a nearly linear dependence of @xmath61 on @xmath60 at the demarcation line .",
    "this fact was also observed experimentally , i.e. , the more salt is present in the system , the higher concentration of polyvalents is needed in order to observe overcharging  @xcite . as already seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : scimp]a the sc theory gives a trend that is only weakly dependent on @xmath109 , which appears to indicate an approximate proportionality relation as @xmath140 .",
    "in real units this translates into a _",
    "heuristic relation _ as @xmath141 consistent with the experimentally observed fact that counterions with higher valency @xmath0 are more efficient at overcharging , which has also been observed experimentally  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless one needs to keep in mind that ion - specific effects  @xcite also make their mark in strongly coupled systems .",
    "the sc theory based on purely electrostatic grounds appears to be unable to account for the experimentally observed variation in the strength of the sc effects for equally charged polyvalent counterions  @xcite .",
    "the ion specific effects in the sc theory have remained largely unexplored .",
    "in our work we present detailed arguments based on extensive simulation for the validity of the dressed counterion approach and its sc limit , based on a model for an ionic solution mixture composed of a monovalent ( 1:1 ) salt and an asymmetric ( @xmath0:1 ) salt in proximity to a charged dielectric interface .",
    "in the first part we have described the general idea of dressed counterions , i.e. , the coarse - grained electrostatic treatment that replaces explicit monovalent - ion degrees of freedom by the effective debye - hckel interaction between the remaining charges comprised of the polyvalent counterions and the surface charges .",
    "this idea is valid in highly asymmetric systems with @xmath11 and stems from the fact that monovalent ions are weakly coupled with all the other charges .",
    "we compared the mc results of dressed counterions ( referred to as implicit simulations ) with the standard explicit mc simulations ( referred to as explicit simulations ) where all the ions are treated explicitly . comparing the results for the density profiles of polyvalent counterions we found excellent agreement between both types of simulations .",
    "generally , counterions are attracted toward the surface because of direct electrostatic interactions but are expelled from the vicinity of the surface due to the dielectric image charges and in general solvation repulsion . for large polyvalent salt concentration we observed overcharging , i.e. , the net excess of opposite charge near the surface",
    ". both types of simulations agree fairly well on the degree of overcharging , which is typically of the order of few percent of the surface charge , in accordance with recent mc studies  @xcite . in the second part of the paper we implemented the analytical sc dressed counterion",
    "approach , based on a strong - coupling one - particle description  @xcite , to the model at hand .",
    "the sc dressed counterion theory gives a very simple analytical expression for the counterion density profile , eq .",
    "( [ eq : csc ] ) , and also enables simple predictions for the onset of overcharging .",
    "we estimated the regime of validity of the sc theory based on the fact that the counterion - counterion interactions should be negligible when compared to the thermal energy .",
    "as it turns out this criterion approximately coincides with the onset of overcharging . in other words ,",
    "the sc dressed counterion theory is valid in the regime just below the overcharging regime , which was confirmed by implicit mc simulations . in its regime of validity",
    "the sc dressed counterion theory gives good predictions for the density profile of counterions and can also approximately predict the onset of overcharging . in agreement with the mc simulations ,",
    "the theory shows a linear relationsip between the polyvalent salt concentration needed for overcharging and the monovalent salt concentration in the system .",
    "it also predicts higher - valency counterions are more effective in overcharging the surface .",
    "these results agree with recent experimental findings  @xcite .",
    "finally we should emphasize that the merit of the dressed counterion approach is firstly in its practical use in implicit mc simulations , which give satisfactory results and can be several orders of magnitude less expensive compared to explicit mc simulations .",
    "secondly , it can be easily included in analytical frameworks for charged systems ( e.g. , the strong coupling theory in our case ) , which may thus allow for a deeper understanding of the general features of the charged systems that contain highly asymmetric electrolytes .",
