    "in this paper we discuss , in the framework of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics , two subjects related to the two - dimensional coulomb - like potential in the plane .",
    "in the first part , in section  [ sec : point ] , we reexamine the two - dimensional hydrogen atom . this is to say that we consider a quantum model in the plane with the attractive potential @xmath5 which we call the two - dimensional coulomb ( or hydrogenic ) potential .",
    "this model has already been studied from various points of view in the physical literature .",
    "a detailed analysis of this system is given in @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "the corresponding green function is constructed in @xcite , though with some minor misprints .",
    "more mathematically oriented questions like the proper definition of the hamiltonian as a self - adjoint operator are shortly discussed in the recent paper @xcite .",
    "note that some interest to this type of models also comes from semiconductor physics . in a semiconductor quantum well under illumination ,",
    "excited electrons and holes are essentially confined to the plane and interact via a mutual coulomb interaction which results in the creation of electron - hole bound states , known as excitons @xcite . moreover , as shown in the second part of the paper , the two - dimensional hydrogenic hamiltonian can be viewed as an approximation of the hamiltonian of a hydrogen atom in a thin planar layer .",
    "let us point out , however , that if a hydrogen atom is supposed to be two - dimensional in the strict sense , i.e. all fields including electromagnetic fields , the angular momentum , and the spin are confined to the plane , then ( [ eq:2d_coul ] ) is no longer eligible to as the two - dimensional coulomb potential .",
    "indeed , the coulomb law may be derived from the first maxwell equation ( gauss s law for electrostatics ) stating that @xmath6 where @xmath7 stands for the planar charge density , @xmath8 , and the electric field is supposed to be rotationally symmetric .",
    "integration of this equation over a disk of radius @xmath9 together with application of green s theorem leads to the choice of the potential in the form @xmath10 the schrdinger equation for this potential is studied in @xcite .",
    "one of the goals of the present paper is to describe a central point interaction combined with the two - dimensional coulomb - like potential and to study its basic properties .",
    "the construction of point interactions based on the theory of self - adjoint extensions is now pretty well established . to our best knowledge , however ,",
    "the two - dimensional coulomb - like potential is not yet discussed in the literature , including the well known monograph @xcite where only the one - dimensional and the three - dimensional cases are considered . on the other hand",
    ", there exists a general theoretical background for the construction of self - adjoint extensions with singular boundary conditions , as described in paper @xcite , which is directly applicable to our model .    along with the construction of point interactions in the coordinate representation , and this is the standard way how to proceed , we discuss the construction also in the momentum representation .",
    "moreover , we derive an explicit relation between the two representations . this correspondence is based on the whittaker integral transformation whose integral kernel is a properly normalized generalized eigenfunction of the two - dimensional coulomb - like hamiltonian depending on the spectral parameter .",
    "remarkably , this integral transformation has been studied in the mathematical literature quite recently @xcite . on this point",
    "we refer , first of all , to paper @xcite where the unitarity of the eigenfunction expansion is proven for a much more general class of schrdinger operators on a halfline .    in the second part of the present paper , in section  [ sec : layer ] , we study the hydrogen atom in a thin planar layer of width @xmath11 , called @xmath12 . in our model",
    ", we confine the atom to the slab by imposing the dirichlet boundary condition on the parallel boundary planes .",
    "our main goal in this section is to show that the resulting hamiltonian in @xmath13 , called @xmath14 , is well approximated in a convenient sense by the two - dimensional coulomb - like hamiltonian as the width of the layer approaches zero .",
    "the method we use is strongly motivated by the paper by brummelhuis and duclos @xcite .",
    "firstly , we apply the projection on the first transversal mode getting this way the so - called effective hamiltonian in @xmath2 .",
    "then , in subsection  [ sec : coul_eff ] , we show that the norm resolvent limit of the effective hamiltonian , as @xmath15 , exactly equals the two - dimensional hydrogenic hamiltonian plus the energy of the lowest transversal mode . as a next step",
    "we prove , in subsection  [ sec : eff_aprox ] , that the full hamiltonian @xmath14 is well approximated by the effective hamiltonian , again in the norm resolvent sense .",
    "since the spectrum of @xmath16 is known explicitly one can use this approximation to derive , with the aid of standard perturbation methods , asymptotic formulas for the eigenvalues of @xmath14 though we do not go into details at this point .",
    "let @xmath17 be the free hamiltonian in @xmath18 .",
    "it is known that the coulomb - like potential @xmath19 in the plane is @xmath20 form bounded with relative bound zero .",
    "this is a consequence of the kato inequality ; the proof is given in @xcite but see also @xcite where even a more general case is treated . in more detail , the inequality claims that @xmath21 suppose @xmath1 . by the klmn theorem ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  x.17 ) , the operator@xmath22 is self - adjoint .",
    "the form domain of the hamiltonian @xmath16 coincides with that of the free hamiltonian , i.e. with the first sobolev space .",
    "in particular , @xmath23 . note that the same conclusions can also be deduced from the results in ( * ? ? ?",
    "xiii.11 ) .",
    "the operator @xmath16 has been studied quite intensively in the physical literature ( see , for example , @xcite ) .    to introduce a central point interaction",
    "let us consider the densely defined symmetric operator,@xmath24 denote by @xmath25 the closure of @xmath26 .",
    "then @xmath16 is exactly the friedrichs extension of @xmath25 . as usual",
    ", the hilbert space naturally decomposes in the polar coordinates @xmath27,@xmath28 and the operator @xmath25 decomposes correspondingly,@xmath29 where @xmath30 is the closure of the operator@xmath31 put also @xmath32 . for the maximal operator one has ( * ? ? ?",

    "two independent solutions are expressible in terms of the whittaker functions , namely@xmath39 with @xmath40 . from the asymptotic expansions it follows ( see , for instance , @xcite ) that the former function in ( [ eq : whittakermw ] ) is square integrable at zero but is not square integrable at infinity while the latter one is square integrable at infinity but is not square integrable at zero , except of the case @xmath41 .",
    "thus for @xmath42 , the operators @xmath43 are self - adjoint while for @xmath41 , @xmath44 has deficiency indices @xmath45 . for a wide class of schrdinger operators , including our case as well ,",
    "an explicit construction of all self - adjoint extensions defined by boundary conditions can be found in @xcite .",
    "all self - adjoint extensions of @xmath44 are @xmath46 , @xmath47 , with the domains@xmath48 where the boundary values @xmath49 are defined by @xmath50 the self - adjoint extension @xmath51 determined by the boundary condition @xmath52 coincides with the friedrichs extension of @xmath44 .",
    "all self - adjoint extensions @xmath53 of @xmath54 are again labeled by @xmath47 and are equal to@xmath55 in particular , @xmath56 coincides with @xmath16 .    for the essential spectrum one has @xmath57 and , more generally , @xmath58 for all @xmath47 .",
    "let us introduce ( temporarily ) the functions@xmath59 and denote by @xmath60 and @xmath61 the corresponding multiplication operators .",
    "put @xmath62 .",
    "since @xmath63 is bounded and tends to zero at infinity one knows that @xmath64 ( see , for instance , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  4.1 ) ) .",
    "note that , by the closed graph theorem , @xmath65 is bounded for @xmath66 sufficiently large .",
    "moreover , @xmath61 is a relatively form bounded perturbation of @xmath67 and @xmath16 equals the form sum @xmath68 .",
    "it is shown below , in the proof of lemma  [ lem : gen_dif_est ] , that the operator @xmath69 is hilbert - schmidt and hence compact .",
    "consequently , @xmath61 is a relatively form - compact perturbation of @xmath67 and , by the results in ( * ? ? ?",
    "xiii.4 ) related to the weyl theorem , @xmath70 . to extend the equality to all @xmath53",
    "it suffices to observe that , by the krein formula , the resolvent of @xmath53 is a rank - one perturbation of the resolvent of @xmath56 .    by the general theory of sturm - liouville operators , the resolvent kernels @xmath71 of the partial hamiltonians @xmath51 , if @xmath41 , and @xmath72 , if @xmath42 , are equal to @xmath73 here @xmath74 , @xmath75 denote the smaller and the greater out of @xmath9 , @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "the green function @xmath77 for the hamiltonian @xmath78 , @xmath79 , can be constructed using the krein resolvent formula that guarantees existence of a function @xmath80 such that@xmath81 with @xmath36 .",
    "since the integral kernel must satisfy the same boundary condition as that defining @xmath82 we have @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the polygamma function and @xmath85 is the euler constant .",
    "the green function of @xmath53 , @xmath47 , expressed in polar coordinates , equals @xmath86    the point spectrum of @xmath16 equals the union of the point spectra of @xmath87 , @xmath37 ( with @xmath88 ) .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath16 jointly with eigenfunctions are computed in @xcite and correspond to the poles of the respective green functions .",
    "thus we recall that all eigenvalues of @xmath87 , @xmath37 , are simple and are equal to @xmath89 ( here @xmath90 ) .",
    "denote by @xmath91 the principal quantum number and put @xmath92 for @xmath93 , i.e. @xmath94 , @xmath95 .",

    "the corresponding normalized eigenfunctions are @xmath98 where @xmath99 stands for the associated laguerre polynomial .    using a similar reasoning as in @xcite",
    "one concludes that the point spectrum of @xmath53 , @xmath79 , contains the eigenvalues @xmath96 with multiplicities @xmath100 ( hence @xmath101 is missing ) .",
    "in fact , the point spectrum of @xmath87 is simple and is formed by the eigenvalues @xmath96 , @xmath102 .",
    "if a point interaction is switched on then the spectrum of the component @xmath103 is deformed while the point spectra of the components @xmath87 , @xmath42 , remain untouched . on the other hand , if @xmath79 then additional eigenvalues emerge in the spectrum of @xmath53 , the so called point levels .",
    "they are simple and negative .",
    "let us denote them in ascending order by @xmath104 , @xmath105 .    from the general theory concerned with friedrichs extensions (",
