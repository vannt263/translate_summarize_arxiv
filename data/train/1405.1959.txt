    "observations of the cmb such as the planck mission  @xcite , have verified that the spectral index of the scalar perturbation deviates from the flat spectrum with more than @xmath1 , which strongly suggests the realization of the inflation . by the detection of the tensor mode in the near future , this inflation theory and its energy scale will be confirmed .",
    "the domination of the inflaon s energy over the universe induces the cosmic accelerating expansion , which dilutes the other matter contents and their asymmetry presented before inflation . on the other hand , by the observation of cmb  @xcite and by the measurements of the primordial abundances of the light elements  @xcite , the abundance of the baryon asymmetry after the big bang nucleosynthesis is confirmed as @xmath2 . to explain this asymmetry ,",

    "supposed the quadratic chaotic inflation  @xcite , the constraint for the abundance of the tensor mode by planck mission  @xcite suggests that the potential takes some suppression by the higher terms such cubic one as @xmath4 .",
    "in the previous studies  @xcite , it is showed that if this higher term breaks @xmath0 symmetry such as @xmath5 , its breaking gives the variation of the inflaton for the phase direction after the inflation and then the asymmetry of the inflaton is produced .",
    "furthermore , @xcite have showed that by the decay of the inflaton assigned baryon number , the large amount of the baryon asymmetry is produced to explain the observed one @xmath6 .",
    "as showed in  @xcite , the abundance of the tensor mode for this model is mainly determined by the quadratic term @xmath7 , however , the higher terms @xmath8 would also gives the sizable modulation of the the tensor mode . this higher term is also the source of the inflaton s asymmetry , which thus means that the tensor mode is correlated with the inflaton s asymmetry , and then with the baryon asymmetry . in this paper , we have investigated the relation between the prediction for the tensor mode and the abundance of the baryon asymmetry produced by the inflaton , supposing the polynomial inflation where @xmath0 symmetry is broken by the cubic term as @xmath9 .",

    "we suppose that the strength of the asymmetric term is small so that the modulation of the cubic term for the quadratic term is small at @xmath27 e - folds as @xmath29 . in this section",
    ", we neglect the dynamical variation of the inflaton s phase during inflation , and set the phase by the constant one as @xmath30 .",

    "the curvature perturbations produced by inflaton and the graviton s fluctuations are imprinted on cmb as the scalar and the tensor mode .",
    "the scale dependence of the scalar mode is given by the spectral index @xmath11 , and the abundance of the tensor mode is given by the tensor to scalar ratio @xmath10 .",

    "the @xmath52 relation is the point like one regardless of the initial phase , which is the same pint as the chaotic inflation predicts .",
    "however , for the larger one @xmath54 , due to the cubic term modulation , the prediction for the tensor to scalar ratio depends on the initial phase of the inflaton , which will be tested in the future observation of the cmb .",
    "this initial phase of the inflaton also relate to the amount of the inflaton s asymmetry , then finally relates to the baryon asymmetry , which is described in the next section .",
    "during the inflation , the variation for the phase direction is negligible due to the hubble friction , and after the inflation it stars to roll down to the minimum @xmath55 .",
    "this rotation for the phase direction produces @xmath0 charge of the inflaton . at the same time , the hubble expansion decreases the amplitude of the radial direction , which suppresses the cubic term and then the @xmath0 charge becomes time independent . by the decay of inflaton into other particles ,",

    "we calculate this constant value of @xmath67 for each initial phase in @xmath68 cases .    in order to taking account the dynamical variation of the phase direction even during the inflation ,",

    "inflaton starts to oscillation and then , by the suppression of the cubic term , @xmath67 becomes time independent .",
    "this eventual asymmetry @xmath67 is related with the initial phase of the inflaton @xmath75 and coupling @xmath38 , which is showed in fi.g  [ fig_3 ] .     for @xmath68 .",
    "@xmath50 is defined by the initial phase as @xmath49 . ]    from this figure , we can see that for @xmath54 , the typical value of the inflaton asymmetry @xmath67 is @xmath76 up to @xmath77 .",
    "we suppose that the inflaton has the baryon number @xmath78 . in this case",
    ", the @xmath0 charge is the baryon asymmetry . by the decay of the inflaton",
    ", this asymmetry @xmath67 is transferred to the baryon particles . under the assumption that the inflaton rapidly decays into radiations",
    "when the decay rate @xmath79 becomes comparable with the hubble dilution rate @xmath80 ( reheating ) , the baryon to entropy ratio today @xmath81 is estimated by the one at the reheating as @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the reheating temperature . from eq .",
    "( [ eq:16 ] ) , we can see that the baryon to entropy ratio linearly depends on the reheating temperature @xmath83 , which is determined by the temperature of the radiation at @xmath84 as @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the relativistic freedom , and we have supposed as @xmath87 .",
    "thus , for the low decay rate of the inflaton so that the reheating temperature is low as @xmath88 , the baryon asymmetry of the universe is produced by the inflaton s cp asymmetric term . for the protection of the flatness of the inflaton potential ,",
    "this low decay rate for the baryonic charged inflaton is plausible such as the dimension five operator suppressed by the gut scale . , where @xmath89 is the coupling constant , and @xmath90 are super field of the up and down quarks .",

    "supposing that the strength of the coupling is gauge s one as @xmath92 , and supposing that the suppression scale is gut scale as @xmath93 for @xmath94 , we obtain the reheating temperature as @xmath95 . ]",
    "in this paper , we have considered a complex inflaton with the baryon number , whose baryon @xmath0 asymmetry is slightly broken by the cubic term in the potential .",
    "depending on the initial phase of the inflaton , the curvature of the inflaton s potential is modulated by the cubic term , and then the tensor to scalar ratio @xmath10 at the cmb scale takes the specific value for each initial phase . on the other hand ,",
    "the cubic term gives the initial velocity for the phase direction and then by the affleck dine mechanism , the baryon charge @xmath67 is produced depending on the initial phase . after the decay of the inflaton , the inflaton s baryon charge is transferred into the baryon particles .    in this paper , we have evaluated @xmath10 and @xmath67 , numerically solving the evolution of the inflaton for each initial phase as showed in fig .",

    "that the inflaton has the baryon number , its decay would be induced by the higher dimensional operator , in order to protect the flatness of the inflaton s potential . as noted in the end of the sec .",
    "[ sec : baryon production ] , if this decay is induced by dimension 5 operator whose suppression scale is gut scale , the reheating temperature becomes @xmath98 , which explains present baryon to entropy ratio ( [ eq:16 ] ) . for this large coupling @xmath99 ,",
    "the variation of the tensor mode is large as @xmath100 around @xmath101 , which is out of @xmath102 deviation but within @xmath103 deviation from the constraint of the planck mission  @xcite .",
