    "[ fig : gvsb ] . at a given magnetic field",
    "there are @xmath1 propagating edge states in the leads at the fermi energy .",
    "the electron density in the constrictions is smaller than in the leads , and hence only the lowest @xmath2 states are fully transmitted , whereas the remaining highest @xmath3 states are partially or fully reflected .",
    "a typical conductance of the ab interferometer as a function of magnetic field exhibits a step - like structure with plateaus separated by wide transitions regions.@xcite at very low magnetic fields the conductances of the qpc constrictions are additive and behave like classical ohmic resistors.@xcite when the magnetic field increases the conductance evolves from classical to quantum behavior with the single - particle levels condensed into degenerated landau levels ( lls ) .",
    "the step - like dependence of the conductance reflects successive depopulation of the lls in the constrictions.@xcite the plateau regions correspond to the field range where the qpc openings are fully transparent ( the transmission coefficient through an individual qpc is integer , @xmath4 ) , and transition regions between these plateaus correspond to the partially transparent qpc openings ( the transmission coefficient is non - integer , @xmath5 .",
    "when a single - particle state of the antidot - bound edge channel coincides with the fermi energy @xmath6 , it provides a pathway for scattering from an edge channel on one side of the sample to an edge channel on the opposite side .",
    "thus , it gives rise to pronounced ab conductance oscillations in the transition regions between the plateaus .    according to the conventional theory of the aharonov - bohm interferometer@xcite its conductance shows a peak each time the enclosed flux @xmath7 changes by the flux quantum @xmath8 .",

    "[ fig : gvsb ] . the enclosed flux through the interferometer can also be varied at a fixed magnetic field by changing an antidot gate voltage @xmath12 . in the case when the area changes linearly with the change of the gate voltage , @xmath13 the expected periodicity is @xmath14    since the experimental study of hwang _",

    "this gives valuable information about actual depletion region in two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) .",
    "however , in the recent experimental work of goldman _ _ et al.__@xcite , it was reported that the periodicity of the ab oscillations as a function of the magnetic field depends on the number of fully transmitted states in the constriction @xmath16 and is then well described by the dependence @xmath17which differs by a factor @xmath18 from the conventional formula . on the other hand ,",

    "moreover , in the absence of interactions , both spins should participate in the resonant scattering , contradicting the experimental observation that only the spin species with the larger zeeman energy contributes to the resonances.@xcite thus , experimental findings gave strong motivation for a model that takes electron interactions into account .",
    "to explain double - frequency aharonov - bohm oscillations , models accounting for the formation of compressible rings around the antidot@xcite and capacitive interaction between excess charges were introduced@xcite .",

    "assuming that a compressible island exists inside the quantum dot , the ab period is caused by charging of @xmath16 fully occupied lls in the dot .",
    "the validity of this assumption for the compressible island as well as the electrostatics of the ab interferometer has been discussed in ref . by two of the present authors .",

    "et al._,@xcite we address electron transport through the antidot ab interferometer from different standpoints .",
    "starting from a geometrical layout of the device , we calculate self - consistently the edge state structure , energy level evolution , charge quantization and linear - response conductance in the thomas - fermi and hartree approximations .",

    "the conductance is dictated by the highest occupied ( @xmath27)-th state in the constrictions , but the @xmath16 antidot - bound states are well localized and do not participate in transport .",
    "electron interactions in the hartree approximation pin the @xmath16 single - particle states to the fermi level and force their mutual positions to be correlated .",
    "the hartree approach also predicts that the number of electrons around the antidot oscillates in a saw - tooth manner reflecting sequential escape of electrons from the @xmath16 edge states . for low temperatures",
    ", we have found an interesting phenomenon that we call anti - resonance reflection of the fano type .",
    "while the hartree and thomas - fermi approximations do not reproduce experimental @xmath18 ab periodicity,@xcite we explore two mechanisms that might be relevant , namely scattering by impurities and coulomb blockade tunneling .",

    "the antidot and the leads are treated on the same footing , i.e. the electron interaction and the magnetic field are included both in the lead and in the antidot regions.@xcite    we calculate the self - consistent electron densities , potentials and the conductance on the basis of the green s function technique .",
    "the description of the method can be found in refs . and",
    "thus the main steps in the calculations are only briefly sketched here .",
    "first we compute the self - consistent solution for the electron density , effective potential and the bloch states in the semi - infinite leads by the technique described in ref . .",

    "this procedure is repeated many times until the self - consisten solution is reached ; we use a convergence criterium @xmath42 , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are input and output densities on each iteration step @xmath45 .    finally the conductance is computed from the landauer formula , which in the linear response regime is@xcite @xmath46 where the transmission coefficient @xmath47 , is calculated from the green s function between the leads.@xcite    to clarify the role of the electron interaction we also calculate the conductance of the open dot in the thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximation where the self - consistent electron density and potential are given by the semiclassical tf equation at zero field @xmath48 this approximation does not capture effects related to electron - electron interaction in quantizing magnetic field such as formation of compressible and incompressible strips and hence it corresponds to noninteracting one - electron approach where , however , the total confinement is given by a smooth fixed realistic potential.@xcite        while the present approach is not expected to account for single - electron tunneling in the conductance ( leading to the coulomb blockade peaks),@xcite one can expect that it correctly reproduces a global electrostatics of the interferometer and microscopic structure of the quantum mechanical edge states regardless whether the conductance is dominated by a single - electron charging or not .",
    "this is because the interferometer is an open system with a large number of electrons surrounding the antidot and thus the electrostatic charging caused by a single electron hardly affects the total confining potential of the interferometer .",
    "thus the results of the self - consistent hartree approach provide accurate information concerning the locations of the propagating states and the structure of compressible / incompressible strips in the interferometer .",
    "our calculations are also expected to provide detailed information concerning the coupling strengths between the states in the leads and around the antidot .",

    "there must be a balancing influx of electrons into lls in a way that the degeneracy of each ll increases exactly by one .",
    "for the case of a voltage applied to the antidot gate , a background charge in the reference area can be increased and @xmath102 additional electrons can be attracted to the area @xmath98 . hence , we obtain a total charge imbalance inside the area @xmath98 given by @xmath103 , which leads to a charging energy @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the capacitance of the island and @xmath106 means the fractional part of @xmath107 .",

    "secondly , all edge states encircle the antidot at about the same radii from the center and the extent of their wave functions is an unimportant length scale .",

    "third , the charging energy does not depend on which particular edge state builds the charge imbalance at a given field and gate voltage .",
    ". rather treats all @xmath16 states as one single - electron island .",
    "however , our calculations within both the thomas - fermi and hartree approaches identify the highest ll as the most important for electron transport . on the other hand , experimental data clearly indicates that transport occurs via the highest ll ( the outermost edge state ) when the antidot in the cb regime.@xcite thus , we assume that a single - electron island implied in eq .",

    "electrons sequentially hop from the low - lying lls into the extended edge states and vice versa via highest ( @xmath16)-th ll .",

    "each transition rate treats tunneling of a single electron through a tunnel barrier as a random event and depends on the reduction of the electrostatic energy of the system , eq . , resulting from such a tunneling event .",
    "for example , the transition rate from the source electrode to island reads @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the energy change after tunneling from the source to the island and @xmath115 is the resistance of the tunneling barrier between the source and island .",

    "each time the value @xmath122 is approached , an electron tunnel through the potential barriers with no energy cost and substantial current starts flowing through the antidot .",
