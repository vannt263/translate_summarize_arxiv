    "one of the major limitations of coronary interventions lies in the appearance of restenosis of the treated vessel .",
    "restenosis occurs in 35%-40% of the treated patients in case of angioplasty , whilst the percentage reduces to 22%-32% in case coronary stents are used @xcite .",
    "intravascular brachytherapy appears to be a useful tool to solve such problems @xcite .",
    "prevent @xcite and inhibit @xcite studies have pointed out the ability of ionizing radiation to inhibit restenosis .",
    "though either gamma and beta radiation have been used , endovascular beta - radiotherapy has become most popular in europe due to the obvious radiation safety advantages .",
    "this new , rapidly growing interest has led both the aapm @xcite and the estro @xcite to report recommendations on the medical physic issues . at the minimum standard level , dose at the prescription point in the central plane",
    "is encouraged to be recorded and reported .",
    "additional dose calculations in peripheral planes require complete two - dimensional ( 2d ) dosimetry information . however , beta sources present a high dose gradient , the distances in which the dose is deposited being considerably small .",
    "this has made it difficult to perform adequate dosimetry on intravascular sources .",
    "recently , the dosimetric characterization of a 27 mm long , catheter based , @xmath0p beta source wire , manufactured by guidant corporation ( houston , texas , usa ) , has been done by means of plastic scintillator @xcite and radiochromic film @xcite .",
    "monte carlo ( mc ) simulations have proved to be a valuable complementary means for determining the dose distributions around beta emitters .",
    "the @xmath0p source mentioned above has been simulated with different mc codes ( mcnpv4b2 @xcite-@xcite , cyltran / its3 @xcite , mcnpv4c @xcite , egs4 @xcite and egsnrc @xcite ) and the calculated doses agree within @xmath6% with the experimental results .    in this work",
    "we address the 2d dosimetric characterization of a new , clinically used , 20 mm long catheter based @xmath0p beta source wire , commercially available in the galileo@xmath7 intravascular radiotherapy system , manufactured also by guidant corporation .",
    "this source has been used @xcite in a detailed study in which a variety of mc codes are intercompared .",
    "also a comparison with measurements done by using radiochromic - dye film and an extrapolation chamber is carried out . measured and calculated values were found to agree within 10% in a polystyrene phantom . on the other hand ,",
    "the calculated depth dose curves , using the mc codes , were within 5% at 4  mm depth , after an adequate selection of the tracking parameters . in this last case water",
    "was considered the medium surrounding the source .",
    "here we have used the mc codes penelope @xcite and geant4 @xcite .",
    "penelope was designed specifically to account for the transport of low - energy electrons , photons and positrons and has been used to simulate other brachytherapy sources @xcite .",
    "geant4 includes special packages which permit to describe low energy physics processes and , at present , it is being used to simulate different situations of medical physics interest @xcite . in this work",
    "we have determined the dose rate at the reference point , the depth dose and the two dimensional dose distribution .",
    "we also calculated the radial dose and the anisotropy functions , as proposed in the adapted aapm tg-60 formalism for cylindrical sources @xcite , used also in ref .",
    "we compare some of our results with those quoted in ref .",
    "a schematic view of the geometry of the two sources analyzed is shown in fig .",

    "the active cores are cylinders with length of 27 and 20  mm , respectively .",
    "these cores are made of c@xmath8h@xmath9o@xmath8 .",
    "the 20  mm source presents a 0.019  mm thick source carrier wrapping the active core .",
    "this is made of polymide .",
    "the cores are encapsulated by niti tubes with thickness of 0.076  mm in both sources . in the 27  mm source ,",
    "a tungsten x - ray marker of 1  mm in length follows the core at the distal end . in the case of the 20  mm source ,",
    "two markers of the same characteristics are located at both the distal and the proximal ends of the active core .",
    "both sources include a niti plug of 1  mm in length following the distal tungsten x - ray marker .",
    "a niti hemispherical seal is welded at the distal end and an unbound niti wire is attached to the proximal end in both sources .",
    "empty regions between the different pieces and the capsules are supposed to be filled with air .",
    "sources are centered inside a catheter of nylon-12 . in some of the calculations done for the 27  mm source , we have considered a helicoidal catheter ( labeled catheter 1 ) reported in refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite . in the case of the 20  mm source",
    ", we have calculated using both this helicoidal catheter and a lobed catheter ( labeled catheter 2 ) currently in use .",
    "this catheter is a new design to increase the blood flow during the procedure .",
    "both catheters were modeled as tubes with an external radius of 0.4445  mm , while the inner diameter was 0.597  mm for catheter 1 and 0.5716  mm for catheter 2 .",
    "gaps between catheters and sources are assumed to be filled with air .",

    "7 shows the relative difference @xmath11 between the depth doses calculated with and without catheter for penelope ( squares ) and geant4 ( disks ) .",
    "the results corresponding to the 20  mm source are shown .",
    "as we can see , both codes produce similar results with both catheters .",
    "however , geant4 shows an increase of the effect of the catheter above @xmath12  mm which is not present in the penelope calculation .",
    "similar results are obtained for the 27  mm source sheathed by catheter 1 .",
    "on the other hand , catheter 2 produces a modification of the dose in water slightly smaller than catheter 1 .",
    "this last gives rise to enhancements of the dose rate on the transverse axis reaching @xmath13% above @xmath14  mm , whilst the first one increases the dose rate by @xmath15% at most .",
    "this result is reasonable if one considers that catheter 2 has a smaller inner radius than catheter 1 , thus reducing the air gap . in any case",
    ", uncertainties in source strength measurements might outweigh this correction in clinical practice .",
    "in this work we have performed the dosimetric characterization of two wire sources of @xmath0p ( of 27  mm and 20  mm active length ) manufactured by guidant corporation and clinically used in intravascular brachytherapy .",
    "to do so we have used the monte carlo codes penelope and geant4 .    first we have validated the codes by comparing the results obtained with these two codes with those available in the literature for the 27  mm source .",
    "the main conclusion is that penelope produces dose rates in reasonable agreement with those quoted in ref .",
    "@xcite for egsnrc and egs4 except in the tails of the axial doses ( large @xmath16 values ) .",
    "calculations performed with mcnpv4b2 @xcite differ from those obtained with penelope as the distance to the source increases .",
    "the comparison between penelope and geant4 shows a clear disagreement .",
    "for the 20  mm source , we have calculated the depth doses on the transverse axis , the two - dimensional dose rate table and the radial dose and anisotropy functions ( this two last according to the approach proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite for cylindrical sources ) .",
    "we have checked that the dose distribution remains uniform along the axial direction for @xmath17 smaller than 6 - 7  mm and @xmath18  mm . besides",
    ", we have tested the symmetry of the dose distribution .",
    "the dose rates calculated with penelope show a good agreement with the scarce data available , while those obtained with geant4 follow a trend similar to that observed in the 27  mm source .    the presence of the catheter sheathing the sources produces an increase in the dose rate on the transverse axis .",
    "this enhancement is larger for the helicoidal catheter ( catheter 1 ) than for the lobed one ( catheter 2 ) .",
    "for the first one , the dose on the transverse axis increases up to 4% above @xmath14  mm , while the second one produces a maximum enhancement of @xmath15% .",
    "these differences could produce non - negligible modifications in the clinical use of the sources .",
    "the results we have obtained indicate that penelope produces a dose rate map which can be considered to represent the dosimetric characterization of the sources here studied .",
    "the appreciable discrepancies shown by geant4 results need a deeper investigation in order to clarify the origin of these differences .",
    "in particular , to determine if they are due to the physics included in the simulations or to the tracking procedure should be of great interest .",
