    "weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) ( hereafter generically denoted by @xmath8 ) with masses @xmath9 in the range of few gev to few tev are a natural candidate for the dark matter ( dm ) in the universe ; see e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews .",
    "several experiments are currently engaged in efforts to directly detect such wimps by observing nuclear recoils due to scattering of wimps off nuclei in suitably chosen detector materials in underground laboratories .",
    "recent results from some of these direct detection ( dd ) experiments , in particular the annual modulation of the nuclear recoil event rates reported by the dama / libra collaboration  @xcite and the excess of low energy recoil events reported by the cogent collaboration  @xcite have raised the interesting possibility  @xcite that these events could be due to wimps of relatively low mass , approximately in the range @xmath0 510 gev , interacting with nuclei with a wimp - nucleon spin - independent elastic cross section in the region of few @xmath10pb , without conflicting with the null results from other experiments such as xenon10  @xcite , xenon100  @xcite and cdms - ii - si  @xcite .",
    "earlier analyses ( before the cogent results  @xcite ) had also found similar compatibility of the dama / libra annual modulation signal with the null results from other dd experiments ; see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite .     scattering of wimps off nuclei can also lead to capture of the wimps by massive astrophysical bodies such as the sun or the earth if , after scattering off a nucleus inside the body , the velocity of the wimp falls below the escape velocity of the body .",
    "the wimps so captured over the lifetime of the capturing body would gradually settle down to the core of the body where they would annihilate and produce standard model particles , e.g. , @xmath11 etc .",
    "decays of these particles would then produce neutrinos , gamma rays , electrons - positrons , protons - antiprotons , etc . for astrophysical objects like the sun or the earth",
    ", only the neutrinos would be able to escape .",
    "detection of these neutrinos by large neutrino detectors can , albeit indirectly , provide a signature of wimps .",
    "although no detection has yet been reported , the super - kamiokande ( s - k ) detector , for example , has provided upper limits on the possible neutrino flux from wimp annihilation in the sun as a function of the wimp mass  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the @xmath12-rays produced in the annihilation of the wimps in suitable astrophysical environments with enhanced dm density but low optical depth to gamma rays , such as in the central region of our galaxy , in dark matter dominated objects such as dwarf galaxies , and in clusters of galaxies , can offer a complimentary avenue of indirect detection ( i d ) of wimps .",
    "although no unambiguous gamma ray signals of dark matter origin have been reported , a recent analysis  @xcite of the spectral and morphological features of the gamma ray emission from the inner galactic center region ( within a galactocentric radius of @xmath13 ) measured by the fermi gamma - ray space telescope ( fgst ) seems to suggest the presence of a gamma ray emission component which is difficult to explain in terms of known sources and/or process of gamma ray production , but is consistent with that expected from annihilations of wimps of mass in the 79 gev range ( annihilating primarily to tau leptons ) with a suitably chosen density and distribution of the dark matter in the galactic center region ; see , however , ref .",
    "@xcite for a different view .",
    "in this paper we focus on the neutrinos produced by annihilations of wimps in the core of the sun , and study the constraints imposed on the wimp mass vs.  wimp - nucleon cross section , for low - mass ( @xmath14 ) wimps , from non - detection of such neutrinos .",
    "this is done within the context of a self - consistent model of the finite - size dark halo of the galaxy  @xcite that includes the gravitational effect of the observed visible matter on the dm in a self - consistent manner , with the parameters of the model determined from fits to the rotation curve data of the galaxy  @xcite .    the expected flux of neutrinos from the sun due to wimp annihilations depends on the rate at which wimps are captured by the sun .",
    "the capture rate depends on the density as well as the velocity distribution of the wimps in the solar neighborhood as the sun goes around the galaxy .",
    "the density and velocity distribution of the wimps in the galaxy are _ a priori _ unknown .",
    "most earlier studies of neutrinos from wimp capture and annihilation in the sun have been done within the context of the so - called  standard halo model \" ( shm ) in which the dm halo of the galaxy is described by a single component isothermal sphere  @xcite with a maxwellian velocity distribution of the dm particles in the galactic rest frame  @xcite ) .",
    "the velocity distribution is isotropic , and is usually truncated at a chosen value of the escape speed of the galaxy . the density of dm in the solar neighborhood is typically taken to be in the range @xmath15  @xcite . with uncertainty @xmath16 . ]",
    "the velocity dispersion , @xmath17 , the parameter characterizing the maxwellian velocity distribution of the shm , is typically taken to be @xmath18 .",
    "this follows from the relation  @xcite , @xmath19 , between the velocity dispersion of the particles constituting a single - component self - gravitating isothermal sphere and the asymptotic value of the circular rotation speed , @xmath20 , of a test particle in the gravitational field of the isothermal sphere and assuming @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the measured value of the circular rotation velocity of the galaxy in the solar neighborhood .",
    ", as suggested by a recent study  @xcite , would imply a correspondingly higher value of @xmath23 . ]",
    "neutrino flux from dm annihilation in the sun for low mass wimps and the resulting constraints on wimp properties from the super - kamiokande upper limits on such neutrinos have been studied within the context of the shm in refs .",
    "@xcite , which showed that the super - kamiokande upper limits on the possible flux of neutrinos from the sun place stringent restrictions on the dama region of the wimp parameter space .",
    "whereas the shm serves as a useful benchmark model , there are a number of reasons why the shm does not provide a satisfactory description of the dynamics of the galaxy .",
    "first , it does not take into account the modification of the phase space structure of the dm halo due to the significant gravitational effect of the observed visible matter on the dm particles inside and up to the solar circle .",
    "second , the isothermal sphere model of the halo is infinite in extent and has a formally divergent mass , with mass inside a radius @xmath24 , @xmath25 , as @xmath26 , and is thus unsuitable for representing a halo of finite size .",
    "third , the procedure of truncating the maxwellian speed distribution at a chosen value of the local ( solar neighborhood ) escape speed is not a self - consistent one because the resulting speed distribution is not in general a self - consistent solution of the steady - state collisionless boltzmann equation describing a finite system of collisionless dm particles .",
    "in addition , since the rotation curve for such a truncated maxwellian is , in general , not asymptotically flat , the relation @xmath19 used to determine the value of @xmath17 in the maxwellian speed distribution of the isothermal sphere , as done in the shm , is not valid in general . finally , recent numerical simulations  @xcite seem to find that the velocity distribution of the dark matter particles deviates significantly from the usual maxwellian form .",
    "these issues are further discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , where we discussed a self - consistent model of the finite - size dark halo of the galaxy that avoids the above mentioned inconsistencies of the shm and also studied the constraints on wimp properties from the results of the direct detection ( dd ) experiments within the context of this self - consistent halo model .",
    "it is of interest to extend this study to the case of indirect detection ( i d ) of wimps via neutrinos from wimp annihilations in the sun , which is the purpose of this paper .    our model of the phase space structure of the finite - size dm halo of the galaxy",
    "is based on the so - called  lowered \" ( or truncated ) isothermal models ( often called  king models \" )  @xcite of the phase - space distribution function ( df ) of collisionless particles .",
    "these models are proper self - consistent solutions of the collisionless boltzmann equation representing nearly isothermal systems of finite physical size and mass .",
    "there are two important features of these models : first , at every location within the system a dm particle can have speeds up to a maximum speed which is self - consistently determined by the model itself . a particle of maximum velocity at any location within the system can just reach its outer boundary , fixed by the truncation radius , a parameter of the model , where the dm density by construction vanishes .",
    "second , the speed distribution of the particles constituting the system is non - maxwellian . to include the gravitational effect of the observed visible matter on the dm particles , we modify the  pure \" king model df by replacing the gravitational potential appearing in the king model df by the total gravitational potential consisting of the sum of those due to dm and the observed visible matter .",
    "this interaction with the visible matter influences both the density profile and the velocity distribution of the dark matter particles as compared to those for a  pure \" king model .",
    "in particular , the dark matter is pulled in by the visible matter , thereby increasing its central density significantly . when the visible matter density is set to zero and the truncation radius is set to infinity ,",
    "our halo model becomes identical to that of a single - component isothermal sphere used in the shm .",
    "for further discussion of the model , see @xcite .",
    "the dm distribution in the galaxy may have significant amount of substructures which may have interesting effects on the wimp capture and annihilation rates  @xcite .",
    "however , not much information , based on observational data , is available about the spatial distribution and internal structures of these substructures . as such ,",
    "in this paper we shall be concerned only with the smooth component of the dm distribution in the galaxy described by our self - consistent model mentioned above , the parameters of which are determined from the observed rotation curve data for the galaxy .    the non - maxwellian nature of the wimp speed distribution in our halo model makes the calculation of the wimp capture ( and consequently annihilation ) rate non - trivial since the standard analytical formula for the capture rate given by gould  @xcite and press and spergel  @xcite , which is widely used in the literature , is not valid for the non - maxwellian speed distribution in our halo model , and as such has to be calculated ab initio ; see section [ sec : capture_annih_rate ] .",
    "we calculate the 90% c.l .",

    "we then study the consistency of those limits with the 90% c.l .",
    " dama - compatible \" regions  the regions of the wimp mass versus cross section parameter space within which the annual modulation signal observed by the dama / libra experiment  @xcite is compatible with the null results of other dd experiments  determined within the context of our halo model  @xcite .",
    "we find that the requirement of such consistency imposes stringent restrictions on the branching fractions of the various wimp annihilation channels .",
    "for example , in the case of spin - independent wimp - proton interaction , while the s - k upper limits do not place additional restrictions on the dama - compatible region of the wimp parameter space if the wimps annihilate dominantly to @xmath1 ,  @xmath2 , portions of the dama - compatible region can be excluded if wimp annihilations to @xmath3 and @xmath4 occur at larger than 35% and 0.4% levels , respectively . in the case of spin - dependent interactions , on the other hand ,",
    "the restrictions on the branching fractions of various annihilation channels are much more stringent .",
    "specifically , they rule out the entire dama region if wimps annihilate to @xmath3 and @xmath4 final states at greater than @xmath70.05% and 0.0005% levels , respectively , and/or to @xmath1 and @xmath2 at greater than @xmath70.5% levels .   the very latest results from the s - k collaboration",
    "@xcite make the above constraints on the branching fractions of various wimp annihilation channels even more stringent by roughly a factor of 34 .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : df_model ] we briefly describe the self - consistent model of the dm halo of the galaxy .",
    "the formalism of calculating the wimp capture and annihilation rates in the sun within the context of our dm halo model , and that for calculating the resulting neutrino flux and event rate in the super - kamiokande detector , are discussed in sections [ sec : capture_annih_rate ] and [ sec : neutrino_flux_event_rate ] , respectively .",
    "our results and the constraints on the wimp properties implied by these results are described in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "the paper ends with a summary in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the phase space distribution function ( df ) of the dm particles constituting a truncated isothermal halo of the galaxy can be taken , in the rest frame of the galaxy , to be of the  king model \" form  @xcite , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the so - called  relative energy \" and @xmath29 the  relative potential \" , @xmath30 being the total gravitational potential under which the particles move , with boundary condition @xmath31 .",

    "@xmath33 the maximum speed a particle of the system can have is ( ) = , [ eq : vmax ] at which the relative energy @xmath34 and , as a consequence , the df ( [ eq : king_df ] ) , vanish .",
    "the model has three parameters , namely , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "note that the parameter @xmath36 in the king model is not same as the usual velocity dispersion parameter of the isothermal phase space df  @xcite .",
    "also , in our calculations below , we shall use the parameter @xmath38 , the value of the dm density at the location of the sun , in place of the parameter @xmath35 .",

    "several studies in recent years have brought into focus the possibility that the dark matter may be in the form of a relatively light wimp of mass in the few gev range .",
    "such light wimps with suitably chosen values of the wimp - nucleon si or sd elastic cross section can be consistent with the annual modulation signal seen in the dama / libra experiment  @xcite without conflicting with the null results of other direct - detection experiments . to further probe the  dama - compatible \" regions of the wimp parameter space",
    " the regions of the wimp mass versus cross section parameter space within which the annual modulation signal observed by the dama / libra experiment is compatible with the null results of other dd experiments  we have studied in this paper the independent constraints on the wimp - proton si as well as sd elastic scattering cross section imposed by the upper limit on the neutrino flux from wimp annihilation in the sun given by the super - kamiokande experiment  @xcite .",

    "this we have done within the context of a self - consistent phase - space model of the finite - size dark matter halo of the galaxy , namely , the truncated isothermal model ( tim )  @xcite , in which we take into account the mutual gravitational interaction between the dark matter and the observed visible matter in a self - consistent manner , with the parameters of the model determined by a fit to the observed rotation curve data of the galaxy .",
    "we find that the requirement of consistency of the s - k  @xcite implied upper limits on the wimp - proton elastic cross section as a function of wimp mass imposes stringent restrictions on the branching fractions of the various wimp annihilation channels . in the case of spin - independent wimp - proton interaction ,",
    "the s - k upper limits do not place additional restrictions on the dama - compatible region of the wimp parameter space if the wimps annihilate dominantly to @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and if direct annihilations to @xmath3 and neutrinos are restricted to below @xmath0 ( 35  45)% and ( 0.4  0.8)% , respectively . in the case of spin - dependent interactions , on the other hand ,",
    "the restrictions on the branching fractions of various annihilation channels are much more stringent , essentially ruling out the dama - compatible region of the wimp parameter space if the relatively low - mass wimps under consideration annihilate predominantly to any mixture of @xmath1 ,  @xmath2 ,  @xmath3 ,  and @xmath4 final states .",
    "the very latest results from the s - k collaboration  @xcite put the above conclusions on an even firmer footing by making the above constraints on the branching fractions of various wimp annihilation channels more stringent by roughly a factor of 34 .",
    "similar conclusions were reached earlier  @xcite within the context of the shm .",
    "the quantitative restrictions on the branching fractions for various wimp annihilation channels obtained here and as given in table  [ table : branching_ratios_up_lims ] ( and in table [ table : branching_ratios_up_lims_sknew_tanaka_m1 ] for the latest s - k results  @xcite ) are , however , significantly different from those in the earlier works .",
    "an important aspect of the truncated isothermal model of the galactic halo used in the present calculation is the _ non - maxwellian nature of the wimp velocity distribution _ in this model , as opposed to the maxwellian distribution in the shm ( see ref .  [",
    "15 ] for details ) .",
    "this directly affects the wimp capture rate ( and consequently the annihilation rate ) , resulting in significant quantitative differences in the values of the upper limits on the wimp - proton elastic cross sections ( implied by the s - k upper limits on the neutrinos from the sun ) compared to the values in the shm .",
    "similarly , the upper limits on the branching fractions of various possible wimp annihilation channels ( from the requirement of compatibility with dama results ) are also changed . at a qualitative level",
    ", however , the general conclusion reached earlier  @xcite within the context of the shm  that s - k upper limits on neutrinos from the sun severely restrict the dama - compatible region of the wimp parameter space  remains true in the present model too , thus adding robustness to this conclusion .",

    "<S> upper limits on the spin - independent ( si ) as well as spin - dependent ( sd ) elastic scattering cross sections of low mass ( @xmath0 2  20 gev ) wimps ( weakly interacting massive particles ) with protons , imposed by the upper limit on the neutrino flux from wimp annihilation in the sun given by the super - kamiokande ( s - k ) experiment , and their compatibility with the  dama - compatible \" regions of the wimp parameter space  the regions of the wimp mass versus cross section parameter space within which the annual modulation signal observed by the dama / libra experiment is compatible with the null results of other direct detection experiments  are studied within the frame work of a self - consistent model of the finite - size dark matter ( dm ) halo of the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the halo model includes the gravitational influence of the observed visible matter of the galaxy on the phase space distribution function of the wimps constituting the galaxy s dm halo in a self - consistent manner . unlike in the  standard halo model \" ( shm ) </S>",
    "<S> used in earlier analyses , the velocity distribution of the wimps in our model is non - maxwellian , with a high - velocity cutoff determined self - consistently by the model itself . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters of the model are determined from a fit to the rotation curve data of the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , for our best fit halo model , for si interaction , while the s - k upper limits do not place additional restrictions on the dama - compatible region of the wimp parameter space if the wimps annihilate dominantly to @xmath1  and/or @xmath2 , portions of the dama - compatible region can be excluded if wimp annihilations to @xmath3 and @xmath4 occur at larger than @xmath5 and @xmath6 levels , respectively . for sd interaction , on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the restrictions on the possible annihilation channels are much more stringent : they rule out the entire dama region if wimps annihilate to @xmath3 and @xmath4 final states at greater than @xmath70.05% and 0.0005% levels , respectively , and/or to @xmath1 and @xmath2 at greater than @xmath70.5% levels . </S>",
    "<S> the very latest results from the s - k collaboration [ t.  tanaka et al , astrophys .  </S>",
    "<S> j.  * 742*:78 ( 2011 ) ] make the above constraints on the branching fractions of various wimp annihilation channels even more stringent by roughly a factor of 34 . </S>"
