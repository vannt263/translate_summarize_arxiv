    "differently , no steady state is allowed in the sir model , but a threshold still exists above which the final fraction of infected nodes is finite  @xcite .",
    "the traditional theoretical study on the epidemic threshold of the sis model was based on the heterogeneous mean - field ( hmf ) theory , which means that all the nodes within a given degree are considered to be statistically equivalent  @xcite . according to the hmf theory ,",
    "the epidemic threshold of sis model is given by  @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the first and second moments of degree distribution @xmath6  @xcite , respectively . on networks with power - law scaling @xmath7  @xcite , where @xmath8 is the degree exponent , one obtains a vanishing threshold in the thermodynamic limit for @xmath9 , while the threshold is finite for @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "as the quenched structure of the network and dynamical correlations between the state of adjacent nodes are neglected in the hmf theory  @xcite , researchers proposed an important improvement over the hmf theory quenched mean - field ( qmf ) theory .",

    "three conventional methods are finite - size scaling analysis  @xcite , susceptibility  @xcite , and lifetime  @xcite .",
    "generally , the finite - size scaling analysis allows the precise numerical determination of the critical point in absorbing - state phase transitions ( e.g. , contact process and ising model ) , but it can not estimate the transition point accurately for networks with strong structural heterogeneity  @xcite .",
    "so far the susceptibility method and lifetime method are only applied to the sis model  @xcite .",
    "different from the case of the sis model , the outbreaks change from an infinitesimal fraction ( @xmath19 ) to a finite fraction ( @xmath20 ) in the sir model  @xcite .",
    "the widely accepted method for estimating the sir epidemic threshold should be the percolation theory  @xcite , according to which the outbreak size is finite above the critical point .",

    "time is incremented by @xmath24 , and the sis or sir process is iterated with synchronous updating  @xcite .",

    "since the disease may die out quickly or infect a subset of nodes when @xmath55 , the distribution of outbreak sizes is bimodal  @xcite , with two peaks occurring at @xmath56 and @xmath57 at @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "therefore , the fluctuation of the outbreak sizes increases monotonically with @xmath0 above the critical point in fig .",
