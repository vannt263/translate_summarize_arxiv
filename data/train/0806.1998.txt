    "hadrons beyond the conventional quark model have been studied for more than thirties years . for example , jaffe suggested the low - lying scalar mesons as good candidates of tetraquark states composed of strongly correlated diquarks in 1976  @xcite . especially there may exist some low - lying exotic mesons with quantum numbers such as @xmath8 which @xmath9 mesons can not access  @xcite .",
    "however the hybrid mesons with explicit glue can carry such quantum numbers .",
    "the experimental establishment of these states is a direct proof of the glue degree of freedom in the low energy sector of qcd and of fundamental importance .",
    "the mass of the non - strange exotic hybrid meson from lattice qcd simulations includes : 2gev  @xcite , 1.74 gev  @xcite , and 1.8 gev  @xcite .",
    "the mass of its strange partner is 1.92 gev  @xcite and 2 gev  @xcite .",
    "the hybrid meson mass from the constituent glue model is 2 gev  @xcite while the value from the flux tube model is around 1.9 gev  @xcite .",
    "the prediction from the qcd sum rule approach is around 1.6 gev  @xcite .",
    "however , yang obtained a surprisingly low mass around 1.26 gev for the @xmath6 hybrid meson using qcd sum rule  @xcite .    up to now , there are several candidates of the exotic mesons with @xmath10 experimentally .",
    "they are @xmath11 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "their masses and widths are ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) mev , ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) mev , ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) mev , respectively  @xcite . @xmath11 was observed in the reactions",
    "@xmath18  @xcite ; @xmath19 and @xmath20  @xcite ; @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "@xmath4 was observed in the reaction @xmath22 ( @xmath23 decays to @xmath24 with a fraction 44.5% )  @xcite .",
    "both @xmath4 and @xmath5 were observed in the reactions @xmath25",
    "@xcite and @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "however , a more recent analysis of a higher statistics sample from e852 @xmath27 data found no evidence of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "all the above observations were from hadron - production experiments .",
    "recently , the clas collaboration performed a photo - production experiment to search for the @xmath6 hybrid meson in the speculated @xmath27 final state in the charge exchange reaction @xmath28  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath4 was an hybrid state , it was expected to be produced with a strength near or much larger than 10% of the @xmath29 meson from the theoretical models  @xcite . however @xmath4 was not observed with the expected strength .",
    "in fact its production rate is less than 2% of the @xmath29 meson .",
    "if the @xmath4 signal from the hadron - production experiments is not an artifact , the negative result of the photo - production experiment suggests ( 1 ) either theoretical production rates are overestimated significantly or ( 2 ) @xmath4 is a meson with a different inner structure instead of a hybrid state .",
    "in fact , the tetraquark states can also carry the exotic quantum numbers @xmath10 .",
    "it is important to note that the gluon inside the hybrid meson can easily split into a pair of @xmath30 .",
    "therefore tetraquarks can always have the same quantum numbers as the hybrid mesons , including the exotic ones .",
    "discovery of hadron candidates with @xmath31 does not ensure that it is an exotic hybrid meson .",
    "one has to exclude the other possibilities including tetraquarks based on its mass , decay width and decay patterns etc .",
    "this argument holds for all these claimed candidates of the hybrid meson .",
    "tetraquark states in general have a richer internal structure than ordinary @xmath32 states .",
    "for instance , a pair of quarks can be in channels which can not be allowed in the ordinary hadrons .",
    "the richness of the structure introduces complication in theoretical studies .",
    "therefore , one usually assumed one or a few particular configurations which are motivated by some intuitions .",
    "recently , we have developed a systematic method for the study of multiquark states in the qcd sum rule , and particular applications have been made for several tetraquark states  @xcite .",
    "our method is essentially based on complete classification of independent currents . by making suitable linear combinations of the independent currents we can perform advanced analysis as compared with",
    "the analysis of using only one type of current which limits the potential of the ope , and sometimes leads to unphysical results .    in this paper , we first classify the flavor structure of four - quark system with quantum numbers @xmath33 .",
    "we find that there are five iso - vector states .",
    "then we construct tetraquark interpolating currents by using both diquark - antidiquark construction ( @xmath34 ) and quark - antiquark pairs ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "we verify that they are just different bases and can be related to each other .",
    "therefore they lead to the same results . by using diquark - antidiquark currents",
    ", we perform the qcd sum rule analysis , and calculate their masses .",
    "our results suggest that @xmath11 may not be explained by just using tetraquark structure , and @xmath4 and @xmath5 could be explained by the tetraquark mesons with quark contents @xmath36 and @xmath37 respectively .",
    "the diquark and antidiquark inside have a mixed flavor structure @xmath38 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : current ] , we construct the tetraquark currents using both diquark ( @xmath39 ) and antidiquark ( @xmath40 ) currents .",

    "[ sec : summary ] is a summary .",
    "in order to construct proper tetraquark currents , let us start with the consideration of the charge - conjugation symmetry .",
    "the charge - conjugation transformation changes diquarks into antidiquarks , while it maintains their flavor structures .",
    "if a tetraquark state has a definite charge - conjugation parity , either positive or negative , the internal diquark ( @xmath39 ) and antidiquark ( @xmath40 ) must have the same flavor symmetry , which is either symmetric flavor structure @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) or antisymmetric flavor structure @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) , and can not have mixed flavor symmetry neither @xmath45 nor @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "however , combinations of @xmath45 and @xmath46 can have a definite charge - conjugation parity . therefore , in order to study the tetraquark state of @xmath48 , we need to consider the following structures of currents @xmath49 where @xmath50 represents an @xmath51 or @xmath52 quark , and @xmath53 represents a @xmath54 quark .",
    "the flavor structures are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tetra ] in terms of @xmath55 weight diagrams .",
    "the quark contents indicated at vertices follow the ideal mixing scheme for inner vertices where the mixing is allowed . in the @xmath55 limit ,",
    "the quark contents are suitable combinations of the ones shown in this figures",
    ". however , the @xmath54 quark has a significantly larger mass than @xmath51 and @xmath52 quarks ( current quark mass ) , and so , the ideal mixing is expected to work well for hadrons except for pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "the flavor structure in the ideal mixing is also simpler than that in the @xmath55 limit .",
    "therefore , we will use the ideal mixing in our qcd sum rule studies .    in the following subsections ,",
    "we first construct currents by using diquark ( @xmath39 ) and antidiquark ( @xmath40 ) currents , and then we show the currents with explicit quark contents . the currents constructed by using quark - antiquark ( @xmath9 ) pairs can be related to these diquark currents , and are shown in the appendix .",
    "[ app : mesoncurrent ] .",
    "the tensor currents @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) can also have @xmath58 . by using tensor currents",
    ", we obtain the similar results , which will be shown in our future work .",
    "we attempt to construct the tetraquark currents using diquark ( @xmath39 ) and antidiquark ( @xmath40 ) currents . for each state having the symmetric flavor structure @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) , there are two @xmath36 currents of @xmath31 , which are independent @xmath59 where the sum over repeated indices ( @xmath60 , @xmath61 for dirac spinor indices , and @xmath62 for color indices ) is taken .",

    ", we also find that there are two independent @xmath69 currents , @xmath70 for each state containing diquark and antidiquark having either the flavor structure @xmath71 or @xmath46 , there are no currents of quantum numbers @xmath31 . however , their combinations @xmath72 can have the quantum numbers @xmath31 .",
    "we first define the currents @xmath73 which belong to the flavor representation @xmath71 , and the currents @xmath74 which belong to the flavor representation @xmath46 separately .",
    "we find the following four independent currents : @xmath75 @xmath76 they all have quantum numbers @xmath77 but no good charge - conjugation parity .",
    "however , their mixing can have a definite charge - conjugation parity , @xmath78 where the @xmath79 and @xmath80 combinations correspond to the charge - conjugation parity positive and negative , respectively . in the present work ,",
    "we only consider the positive one .      for the study of the present exotic tetraquark state , we need to construct iso - vector ( @xmath81 ) currents .",
    "there are two isospin triplets belonging to the flavor representation @xmath82 , one isospin triplet belonging to the flavor representation @xmath83 , and two isospin triplets belonging to the flavor representation @xmath84 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tetra ] ) . for each state , there are several independent currents",

    "we use @xmath99 to make clear that the quark contents here are not exactly correct .",
    "for instance , in the current @xmath93 , the state @xmath100 does not have isospin one .",
    "the correct quark contents should be @xmath101 .",
    "however , in the following qcd sum rule analysis , we shall not include the mass of @xmath51 and @xmath52 quarks and choose the same value for @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "therefore , the qcd sum rule results for @xmath104 with quark contents @xmath105 and @xmath106 are the same .",
    "for the past decades qcd sum rule has proven to be a very powerful and successful non - perturbative method  @xcite . in sum rule analyses ,",
    "we consider two - point correlation functions : @xmath107 where @xmath108 is an interpolating current for the tetraquark . the lorentz structure can be simplified to be : @xmath109 we compute @xmath110 in the operator product expansion ( ope ) of qcd up to certain order in the expansion , which is then matched with a hadronic parametrization to extract information of hadron properties . at the hadron level",
    ", we express the correlation function in the form of the dispersion relation with a spectral function : @xmath111 where the integration starts from the mass square of all current quarks . the the spectral density @xmath112 is defined to be @xmath113 for the second equation , as usual , we adopt a parametrization of one pole dominance for the ground state @xmath114 and a continuum contribution .",
    "the sum rule analysis is then performed after the borel transformation of the two expressions of the correlation function , ( [ def : pi ] ) and ( [ eq : disper ] ) @xmath115 assuming the contribution from the continuum states can be approximated well by the spectral density of ope above a threshold value @xmath116 ( duality ) , we arrive at the sum rule equation @xmath117 differentiating eq .",

    ". are forbidden , and possible decay modes are @xmath214 and @xmath215 etc . summarizing the decay patterns ,",
    "there are two possible decay modes : @xmath204-wave many body decay , such as @xmath208 , and @xmath204-wave two body decay , such as @xmath214 and @xmath215 .",
    "this is partly consistent with the experiments which observe @xmath4 and @xmath5 in the decay modes @xmath215 , @xmath208 and @xmath216 .",
    "however , the experiment has not observe them in the final state @xmath214 .",
    "certainly it is desired to study these decay patterns to obtain more information on the structure of the @xmath203s mesons .",
    "in this paper we have performed the qcd sum rule analysis of the exotic tetraquark states with @xmath58 .",
    "the tetraquark currents have rich internal structure .",
    "there are several independent currents for a given set of quantum numbers .",
    "we have classified the complete set of independent currents and constructed the currents in the form of either @xmath217 or @xmath218 .",
    "as expected , they are shown to be equivalent by having the complete set of independent currents .",
    "physically , this seems to make it difficult to draw interpretation of the internal structure such as diquark ( @xmath39 ) dominated or meson ( @xmath40 ) dominated ones . using the complete set of the currents",
    ", one can perform an optimal analysis of the qcd sum rule .",
    "somewhat complicated feature arises from the flavor structure .",
    "we have tested all possibilities for the isovector @xmath219 states . in the @xmath55 limit , there are three cases of , in the diquark @xmath36 construction , @xmath220 , @xmath221 and @xmath222 .",
    "we find that the former two cases can not result in meaningful sum rule since the spectral functions become negative . on the other hand ,",
    "the mixed case @xmath223 allows positive ope with which we can perform the qcd sum rule analysis .",
    "actual currents have been constructed in the limit of the ideal mixing where the currents are classified by the number of the strange quarks .",
    "hence the quark contents are either @xmath224 or @xmath2 .",
    "we have then performed the svz and finite energy sum rules .",
    "the resulting masses are around 1.6 gev for @xmath224 , and around 2.0 gev for @xmath2 .",
    "the four independent currents lead to the same mass and couple to a single state as shown above .",
    "hence one of our main conclusions is that the higher energy states @xmath4 and @xmath5 are well compatible with the tetraquark picture in the present qcd sum rule analysis . on the other hand",
    ", any combination of the independent currents does not seem to couple sufficiently to the lower mass state @xmath11 , which was , however , described as a hybrid state by k.  c.  yang in ref .",
    "he obtained a low mass around 1.26 gev by using the renormalization - improved qcd sum rules .",
    "the @xmath11 state seems somewhat special , as the experiments show the similarity between @xmath4 and @xmath5 as well as the difference between @xmath11 and the above two states , which we have discussed in the introduction .",
    "we have also studied their decay patterns and found that these states can be searched for in the decay mode of the axial - vector and pseudoscalar meson pair such as @xmath225 , which is sometimes considered as the characteristic decay mode of the hybrid mesons .",
    "the p - wave modes @xmath226 are also quite important .",
    "it is also interesting to study the partners of @xmath203s .",
    "especially , we can study the one with quark contents @xmath227 , which is at the top of the flavor representation @xmath228 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : tetra ] ) .",
    "it has a mass around 2.0 gev , and the decay modes are @xmath229 ( @xmath204-wave ) and @xmath230 ( @xmath204-wave ) etc .",
    "besiii will start taking data very soon .",
    "the search / identification of exotic mesons is one of its important physical goals .",
    "hopefully the dedicated experimental programs on the exotic mesons at besiii and jlab in the coming years will shed light on their existence , and then their internal structure",
    ". more work on theoretical side is also needed .",
    "we will go on to study other tetraquark candidates .",

    "in this appendix , we attempt to construct the tetraquark currents using quark - antiquark ( @xmath9 ) pairs . for each state containing diquark and antidiquark having the symmetric flavor @xmath231 , there are four @xmath188 currents : @xmath232 among these currents , only two are independent . we can verify the following relations @xmath233 moreover , they are equivalent to the @xmath36 currents @xmath234 for each state containing diquark and antidiquark having the antisymmetric flavor @xmath68 , there are also four @xmath188 currents which are non - zero : @xmath235 where two are independent @xmath236 they are equivalent to the @xmath36 currents @xmath237 for the currents which have a mixed flavor symmetry , we just show the @xmath188 currents which belong to the flavor representation @xmath238 .",
