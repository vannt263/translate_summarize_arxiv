    "our galactic center ( gc ) is the nearest nucleus of a galaxy ( @xmath8=8.5 kpc ) @xcite .",

    "the v - band extinction ( @xmath9 ) varies from 20 to 50 mag with a median value of 31.1 mag @xcite .",
    "dust is transparent at radio wavelengths .",
    "however , at millimeter wavelengths , the more abundant molecular lines ( e.g. , co , j = 10 ) become optically thick and suffer from foreground absorption or self - absorption in the direction towards the gc @xcite .",
    "high - excitation molecular lines , or high - density tracers are less affected by the foreground / ambient cold gas @xcite .",

    "our focus is on the complex activities and physical conditions in the nuclear region probed by the dense molecular gas .",
    "we conducted wide - field single - dish observations of the central 30 pc of the gc with multiple transitions of the cs molecule ( * ? ? ? * hereafter paper i ) . in paper",
    "i , we reported a new feature called the connecting ridge ( cr ) which was detected with the cs(@xmath10 ) line .",
    "the cr has a velocity gradient perpendicular to the disk rotation .",
    "it is physically associated with the extraplanar polar arc ( pa ) @xcite .",
    "the pa extends from north of the sgra * region at a 40@xmath11 angle and shows a large velocity gradient from @xmath12 ) to @xmath13 .",
    "below @xmath14 of 70 km s@xmath5 , the pa lies close to the galactic plane and becomes confused with the molecular clouds in the sgra * region . in paper",
    "i , we find that the kinematic and spatial structures connect the galactic disk , the cr , and the pa .",
    "these results suggest that the molecular gas might be lifted out of the galactic plane .",
    "we , thus , proposed the idea of a molecular outflow in the central 30 pc of the gc and suggested that the pa is pushed away , possibly by the energy of 8 - 80 supernovae explosions .",
    "the importance of galactic outflows is that they may be the primary mechanism to recycle metals and to deposit them into the intergalactic medium @xcite . in starburst galaxies ,",
    "vast amounts of stellar winds from massive stars as well as supernovae explosions generate a huge amount of energy and high pressure to create high - velocity galactic winds , which interact with and sweep up the ambient gas .",
    "the gc is the nearest nucleus , and therefore , it is the best target to resolve the structure , kinematics , and physical conditions of nuclear outflows .",
    "the presence of atomic and molecular gas allows us to measure the outflow of neutral material , its impact , and transfer of energy and momentum to the surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) . in this paper",

    "we used the 25 elements of the focal plane receiver ( beam array receiver system : bears ) @xcite to observe the central 108@xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) area of the cmz in the on - the - fly ( otf ) mapping mode @xcite with position - switching . as the backend spectrometer we used digital auto - correlators with a bandwidth of 512 mhz with a spectral resolution of 500 khz with 1024 channels",
    "the total bandwidth was @xmath31740 km s@xmath5 with a resolution of 1.3 km s@xmath5 in the raw data .",

    "the sampling interval along the scan rows was 51 , and the separation between the scan rows was 75 , which corresponds to roughly 1/3 and 1/2 of the beam .",
    "we scanned along the @xmath19 and @xmath20 directions in order to minimize scanning artefacts with the basket - weave method @xcite .",
    "these artefacts originate likely from pointing errors , time variations of the system temperature @xmath21 , insufficient sampling grids , and the non - uniform beam separations of the bears elements @xcite .",
    "the pointing of the antenna was corrected by measuring the sio maser vx sgr every hour with the sis receiver s40 in the 40-ghz band .",
    "the double side band ( dsb ) @xmath21 varied from 300 to 700 k during our observations .",
    "we used the standard chopper wheel method to calibrate the output signal into the antenna temperature @xmath22 , which was corrected for atmospheric attenuation .",
    "since the original @xmath21 measured by bears were dsb @xmath21 , we needed to measure the relative gains of the two sidebands .",
    "we used the single beam receiver s100 , equipped with a single side band ( ssb ) filter to observe a calibrator .",
    "every beam of bears was then scaled to convert from @xmath22(dsb ) to @xmath22(ssb ) .",

    "therefore , the data of a09 were flagged , and we only used 24 receivers .",
    "the resulting gridding size of the map is 7.5@xmath0 , with an effective final resolution of 21@xmath0 with bessel - gaussian convolution and an rms noise of 0.1 k ( @xmath22 ) at a velocity resolution of 2.5 km s@xmath5 . in this paper",

    ", this feature seems to be entrained and swept into the hg - feature from the 20 mc , which shows a similar kinematic behavior as the pa .",
    "the ratios ( @xmath89 ) of the western - hg are higher than those of the cold disk emission ( @xmath90 ) , which suggests a higher excitation state in the western - hg . however , the structures in this region are complicated , and it is difficult to identify structures in the @xmath33 diagrams . moreover , the current results do not show evidence that the hg - feature is a physical bipolar feature because the western and eastern edges do not show a coherent shell expansion .",
    "the asymmetry of the structures in the @xmath33 diagrams might suggest that the outflow phenomenon must be greatly influenced by the asymmetric circumnuclear environment .    in the following , we discuss the physical association between the hg - feature and the radio halo / lobe .",
    "the bipolar radio lobe has counterparts in x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "mixtures of the thermal s and si emission in the radio lobe suggest a thermal origin of the hot plasma @xcite , heated by the shocks from sne and massive stellar winds .",
    "the interaction of the hot plasma with the ambient dense cloud might also produce the observed neutral fe line .",
    "it is unclear whether the hot plasma from the radio lobe in situ can entrain the molecular gas .",
    "we do a self - consistent check of whether the ionized gas of the bipolar radio - lobe is able to entrain the molecular gas from the disk clouds , assuming it is moving outward perpendicular to the gc . for the given emission measure of 2.7@xmath67 pc @xmath91 and the source size of 4@xmath25 @xcite",
    ", we derive the electron density @xmath92 to be 7.8@xmath93 @xmath94 .",
    "the electron temperature is @xmath95 = 5000 k adapted from @xcite .",
    "therefore , we estimate the thermal ionized gas pressure to be @xmath96 @xmath94 k. the thermal pressure of the molecular gas is derived from @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the gas thermal pressure , @xmath99 is the number density of the molecular gas , and @xmath100 is the kinetic temperature .",
    "we assume @xmath99 is @xmath72 @xmath94 ( the critical density of cs(@xmath1 ) ) , and a kinetic temperature of 20 k ( paper i ) .",
    "the @xmath98 is then derived as 2@xmath101 @xmath94 k ( @xmath102 erg @xmath94 ) .",
    "the thermal pressure of the ionized lobe is , thus , sufficient to entrain the molecular gas .",
    "an alternative way is to measure the momentum of the radio halo and compare it with the molecular gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , we are currently lacking velocity information of the radio halo . future kinematic measurements of the radio halo will help to further elucidate the interaction between the ionized and molecular gas .",
    "from our 1-pc resolution cs(@xmath1 ) line maps , we find that the molecular gas in the central 30 pc of the galactic center has a morphology that is reflecting recent explosions @xmath103 years ago . as a follow - up study of paper i",
    ", we revisit the idea that the pa is a molecular outflow launched from the galactic disk .",
    "the linearly increasing velocity of the pa suggests that it is moving out of the galactic disk . near the systematic velocity , the molecular gas shows an hg - feature , which might be a mixture of multiple explosive events . the north - western edge of the hg - feature might trace the entrainment from the 20 mc from @xmath104 to @xmath105 .",
    "the southern part of the eastern edge of the hg - feature suggests an expanding bubble ( b1 ) . the low - level emission of b1 south to the galactic plane is shocked .",
    "these individual features might be complexities on top of a general outflowing shell .",
