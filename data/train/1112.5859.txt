    "this identity has been generalized to cusped hyperbolic surfaces by mcshane himself  @xcite , to hyperbolic surfaces with cusps and geodesic boundary by mirzakhani  @xcite , and to hyperbolic surfaces with cusps , geodesic boundary and conical singularities by tan , wong and zhang  @xcite . a wonderful application to the weil - petersson volume of the moduli spaces of bordered hyperbolic surfaces",
    "was found by mirzakhani  @xcite .",
    "bowditch  @xcite showed that the identity ( [ mcshane_identity ] ) is also valid for all quasifuchsian punctured torus groups where @xmath4 is regarded as the complex translation length of the hyperbolic isometry corresponding to the closed geodesic @xmath5 .",

    "other @xmath6-dimensional variations have been obtained by @xcite .",

    "similarly , a simple arc in a fricke surface joining punctures is said to be _ essential _ if it does not cut off a `` monogon '' , i.e. , a disk minus a point on the boundary . then the isotopy classes of essential simple loops ( essential simple arcs with one end in a given puncture , respectively ) in a fricke surface are in one - to - one correspondence with @xmath26 : a representative of the isotopy class corresponding to @xmath27 is the projection of a line in @xmath28 ( the line being disjoint from @xmath17 for the loop case , and intersecting @xmath17 for the arc case ) .",
