    "thesis @xcite .",
    "knutson also studied the symplectic geometry of these spaces .",
    "our first theorem ( theorem [ thm : krulldimensionbound ] below ) is that @xmath10 is generated in degree strictly less than the krull dimension of @xmath10 , provided that the degree - one piece @xmath7 $ ] is nonzero . the basic idea behind the proof is to show that the degree - one piece contains a system of parameters , and that the @xmath15-invariant of @xmath10 is negative .",
    "( the @xmath15-invariant is the degree of the hilbert series , which is a rational function . )",
    "the theorem then follows from the fact that @xmath10 is cohen  macaulay .",
    "the @xmath15-invariant is negative in all types ; however , for types other than type  a , the degree - one piece sometimes fails to contain a system of parameters .",
    "this condition is equivalent to the condition that all semistable flags lie in the supports of degree - one @xmath12-invariants ; see @xcite for a counterexample in @xmath16 .",
    "it is well known ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) that @xmath10 has a flat degeneration to the semigroup algebra @xmath17 of the semigroup of gelfand  tsetlin patterns associated to semistandard tableaux of shape @xmath18 and content @xmath19 for @xmath20 . in particular , the ring @xmath17 is the graded ring associated to a filtration of @xmath10 by natural numbers .",
    "generators for @xmath17 can be lifted to generators of @xmath10 , so one might hope that @xmath17 is relatively simple .",
    "unfortunately , we find pairs @xmath21 for which @xmath17 has essential generators of degree exponential in @xmath3 .",
    "our second main result ( theorem [ thm : gtdegreebound ] below ) is that , in the case where @xmath22 is a multiple of @xmath23 , the semigroup algebra @xmath24 has an essential generator of degree approximately @xmath25 .",
    "this is in striking contrast to the lower bound of @xmath26 for @xmath27 that follows from our first theorem ( since the krull dimension of @xmath28 is @xmath29 ) .",
    "this case is particularly interesting , because , via the gelfand ",
    "macpherson correspondence , it is the moduli space of @xmath3-tuples of points in the projective plane .",
    "this is a remarkable example of how a semigroup algebra produced by a promising toric degeneration can fail to serve as an effective proxy for the original ring .",
    "our motivation for studying the semigroup of gelfand  tsetlin patterns was to imitate the method of @xcite , which studied the case of @xmath3 points on the projective line .",
    "here one takes @xmath6 to be a multiple of the second fundamental weight @xmath30 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the associated semigroup of gelfand  tsetlin patterns is generated in degree @xmath31 .",
    "we had hoped to use the same method in the case of @xmath3 points in the projective plane , but the second theorem indicates why this is not the right approach .",
    "however , there might still be another toric degeneration that yields a bound better than the one in theorem [ thm : krulldimensionbound ] , perhaps among those discovered by caldero @xcite .",

    "the basis vector @xmath80 is then defined by @xmath81 hence , in the example above , @xmath82 .",

    "these equalities may be shown using induction and the recursive definition of @xmath231 and @xmath232 .",

    "the entries in the tile labeled @xmath249 can not have changed because the top row is fixed .",
    "for the same reason , the @xmath250 entries in @xmath176 are also fixed .",
    "proceeding by induction , the entries in the tile labeled @xmath231 can not have changed because there is a row on which this is the only tile besides the tile labeled @xmath251 and the tile of @xmath250s , which have already been fixed .",
    "hence , the entries in all the tiles labeled @xmath231 , @xmath252 , are fixed under the addition of @xmath253 .",
