    "the smallest reasonable cox configuration was invented many eyars ago , and it appears under various names , depending on the geometry in which it was discovered : mbius configuration of points and planes , steiner - miquel configuration of points , lines , and circles , a suitable biplane ; it is also a completion of the miquel configuration of points and circles / chains . in each case",

    "the circles thus obtained all pass through one point ( the so called _ miquel point _ ) .",
    "it is one of the classical theorems of so called _ advanced euclidean geometry_.    the resulting configuration is much better seen when we retold the whole story on the so called inversive plane : the one - point completion of the euclidean plane i.e. on a sphere",
    ". then the lines of the considered veblen configuration are four circles through a fixed point , and the whole configuration appears fully symmetric .",
    "let us present the steiner - miquel configuration in this way .",

    "recall also that so called miquelian mbius spaces i.e. incidence structures of points and conics on a ( projective ) sphere ( i.e. on a nonruled quadric ) in a pappian projective space are the classical examples of chain structures which satisfy the miquel axiom .    in view of [ fct : mikinmob ]",

    "consequently , @xmath110 contains all the points in @xmath120 .",
