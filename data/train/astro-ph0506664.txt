    "the study of cold ( t @xmath19 k ) atomic gas , a major component of the interstellar medium in the galaxy , is a difficult problem . while hi emission lines can be used to easily map the distribution of the atomic gas , it is often difficult to separate the warm and cold components . on the other hand ,",
    "direct observations of cold hi gas can be obtained from hi lines seen in _ absorption _ against warm , background hi emission ( called hi self - absorption or hisa ) .",

    "@xmath0co j=1@xmath260 was detected but , with only one molecular transition , it is difficult to determine the total @xmath0co column density .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we present observations of @xmath0co j=1@xmath260 and j=2@xmath261 in both the globule and the complex in order to determine the molecular gas content .",
    "our goals are to complement the hisa  observations presented in g2000 , and to better constrain the physical properties of the gas in these two regions .",
    "our observations of the j=1@xmath260 transition of @xmath0co ( @xmath30 = 115.3 ghz ) and @xmath3co ( @xmath30 = 110.2 ghz ) were obtained at the five colleges radio astronomy observatory ( fcrao ) in 2000 february and may . these @xmath0co data were obtained in order to either detect the j=1@xmath260 or , at least , achieve a better sensitivity than the ogs data .",
    "the @xmath3co data were obtained to help determine whether the multiple spectral features seen in some of the @xmath0co observations were due to multiple line - of - sight clouds or self - absorption in the @xmath0co .",
    "the fcrao 14 m telescope has a full width half maximum ( fwhm ) beamsize of 45.5@xmath31 at 115 ghz , and main beam efficiency ( @xmath32 ) of 42% .",
    "the velocity resolution ( channel width ) of these observations is 0.252 km s@xmath24 .",
    "the j=2@xmath261 transition of @xmath0co ( @xmath30 = 230.6 ghz ) was observed at the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) in 2001 september .",
    "the cso is a 10.4 m telescope on mauna kea , hawaii , with a fwhm beamsize of 32@xmath31 , and @xmath32 of 69% ( at 230 ghz ) .",
    "the velocity resolution of these observations was 0.063 km s@xmath24 .    in the globule , we observed a single point at the central position in the j=1@xmath260 transition and an 8 point map with full cso ( 32@xmath31 ) beam spacings in the j=2@xmath261 transition . a ninth position at a half beam spacing ( @xmath33 )",
    "was also observed at the cso . in the complex , we observed a 9 point strip in both @xmath0co transitions , as well as the j=1@xmath260 transition of @xmath3co .",
    "the strip starts at the central position ( labeled as position 1 in figure [ fig : region ] ) , where @xmath0co j=1@xmath260 emission had been detected in the ogs , and moves outwards at constant galactic longitude but increasing galactic latitude ( from @xmath34 = + 0.91@xmath35 to @xmath36 in steps of 25@xmath31 ) to where @xmath0co j=1@xmath260 had not been previously detected .",
    "the spacing of the complex observations were approximately equal to fcrao half beam spacings .",

    "the far right panel in figure [ fig : observations ] shows the convolved @xmath0co j=2@xmath261 spectrum ( solid line ) along with the fcrao j=1@xmath260 spectrum ( dashed line ) at the central position of the globule .",
    "the @xmath0co j=2@xmath261 emission is clearly visible in the convolved spectrum , but below the peak - to - peak noise level of the j=1@xmath260 observations .",
    "this shows that molecular gas is present , but that even our deeper @xmath0co j=1@xmath260 observations did not reach the sensitivity limit required to detect it .",
    "a gaussian profile was fit to the j=2@xmath261 transition , the parameters of which are listed in table [ tab : glob ] under the heading _ convolved to 45@xmath31 resolution_. since there was no signal detected in the j=1@xmath260 transition , the 1@xmath39 rms noise was used as an upper limit on signal strength .",
    "figure [ fig : observations ] clearly shows that , while the hisa   component of the globule lies at @xmath40 = -41 km s@xmath24 , the @xmath0co emission is centered at @xmath40 = -45 km s@xmath24 .",
    "this suggests that these two emission lines are tracing separate clouds along the line of sight .",
    "this suggestion is supported by recent observations of the region with an increased signal to noise ratio in the @xmath0co j=1@xmath260 transition ( brunt , 2005 ) which reveal a number of weak @xmath0co knots in the vicinity of the globule at a @xmath40 of -45 km s@xmath24 . to draw comparisons with the atomic globule at @xmath41 -41 km s@xmath24 we use the 1 @xmath39 rms noise limit for both the j=1@xmath260 and j=2@xmath261 transitions ( @xmath42 = 0.58 and 0.06 k respectively ) as an upper limit on line strength . as an approximation to a line width",
    ", we use the fwhm of the hisa   lines ( @xmath43v@xmath44 = 2.5 km s@xmath24 ) .",
    "this is a valid assumption if the atomic and molecular gas components are mixed and the line widths are dominated by turbulence .",
    "this assumption is supported by the similarities between the hisa  and @xmath0co line widths seen in the complex .",
    "these line parameters are used in section [ glob ] to constrain the molecular gas content of the globule .",
    "the bottom half of each panel in figure [ fig : strip_overlay ] shows the hisa  as a function of position in the complex .",
    "the top halves show the @xmath0co j=2@xmath261 ( solid line ) , @xmath0co j=1@xmath260 ( dashed line ) , and @xmath3co j=1@xmath260 ( dotted line ) at the same positions .",
    "note that figure [ fig : strip_overlay ] is a single strip of observations ( of increasing galactic latitude ) and is only presented as what appears to be a nine point map for readability .",
    "figure [ fig : strip_overlay ] shows interesting changes in the spectral line profiles progressing from the cloud core ( position 1 ) to the edge ( position 9 ) .",
    "the first two positions show emission peaks at @xmath28 -40 km s@xmath24 with blueshifted shoulders ( or secondary peaks ) at @xmath28 -41 km s @xmath24 .",
    "the third position is singly peaked , while the fourth through sixth positions have emission peaks at -41 km s@xmath24 with _ redshifted _ shoulders ( or secondary peaks ) at -40 km s@xmath24 .",
    "the emission drops off rapidly after position 6 , with positions 7 through 9 showing no significant signal . @xmath3co and",
    "@xmath0co observations show similar line profiles , which is suggestive of emission from multiple clouds ( as opposed to self absorption ) .",
    "we will test this assumption in the next section .",
    "gaussian profiles were fit to the spectra in the complex and are listed in table [ tab : com ] .",
    "note that positions 1 and 2 were fit with 2 separate gaussians .",
    "figure [ fig : smoothco ] shows the result of smoothing the @xmath0co j=2@xmath261 in the complex to the velocity resolution of the hi observations ( solid lines of @xmath0co j=2@xmath261 are overlayed on the dotted hisa  profiles ) .",
    "this spectral resampling blends the multiple @xmath0co components ( seen best in positions 1 and 2 ) into one component .",
    "while there is general agreement between the hisa  and the smoothed @xmath0co emission lines , the profiles do not match exactly .",
    "this could be due to a number of different factors : a greater spatial extent for the hisa  than for the @xmath0co , different beamsizes of the observations , or errors in the background subtraction of the hisa  features .",
    "positions 7 though 9 are not shown due to the lack of molecular emission at those positions .",
    "there are a number of techniques for solving the equations of radiative transfer and detailed balance in molecular clouds .",
    "however , to determine the physical parameters of the molecular components of the globule and the complex , we used a large velocity gradient ( lvg ; i.e. goldsmith et al .",
    "1983 ) model which offers a rudimentary approach to determining the bulk properties of a region based on the integrated intensities of the observed lines .",
    "these models employed the collision rates of flower & launay ( 1985 ) and shinke et al .",
    "( 1985 ) .    in this section ,",
    "we describe the method by which we determined the molecular gas column densities from our co observations .",
    "the results of this analysis will be used in section [ discuss ] to constrain the physical properties of the hisa  clouds , as well as the atomic gas fraction .      to determine the molecular gas content in the hisa  globule itself",
    ", we are interested in @xmath0co emission at v@xmath45 = -41 km s@xmath24 . however , since there is no detectable signal at this velocity we set an upper limit to the @xmath0co column density by using the 1@xmath39 rms noise of the @xmath0co j=2@xmath261 transition ( @xmath42 = 0.06 k ) . in lieu of any actual co detection in the globule",
    ", we used a range of parameters chosen to cover the likely range of physical conditions .",
    "thus , for the globule , we used kinetic temperatures from 8 k to 50 k and fixed the density at @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 @xmath15 to check for differences between sub - thermal and lte excitation of the @xmath0co lines .",
    "for each temperature - density combination , we used our lvg code to calculate the @xmath0co j=2@xmath261 brightness for a series of 50 different column densities .",
    "the column densities ranged from @xmath46 @xmath5 and were logarithmically - spaced .",
    "thus , by comparing our 1@xmath39 noise limit to the lvg models , we were able to set an upper limit to the @xmath0co column density for each temperature - density combination .",
    "the maximum @xmath0co column density , corresponding to the lowest temperature - density combination ( 8k and 100 @xmath15 respectively ) , is @xmath47 @xmath5 .    at such small column densities ,",
    "@xmath0co self - shielding is very inefficient and the h@xmath6/@xmath0co abundance ratios can be strongly affected . however , using the photodissociation region ( pdr ) models of van dishoeck & black ( 1988 ) , and assuming that the strength of the uv field is that of the average interstellar radiation field ( i.e. g@xmath48 = 1 ) , we can estimate the total h@xmath6 column density in the globule . for our maximum @xmath0co column density of @xmath47 @xmath5 ,",
    "the van dishoeck & black curves provide an h@xmath6 column density of n(h@xmath6 ) @xmath49 @xmath5 .      for the complex , we only modeled the spectrally smoothed data since they are most directly comparable to the hisa  spectra . in our models we used kinetic temperatures of 12 k to 50 k ( at temperatures lower than 12k we were unable to find a lvg fits to our @xmath0co data ) .",
    "at each temperature we created a @xmath50 logarithmically - spaced grid of lvg models in density - column density parameter space .",
    "the densities ranged from @xmath51 @xmath15 , and the @xmath0co column densities from @xmath52 @xmath5 . the observed line intensities were fit to the grid of lvg models using a @xmath53 minimization routine to find the density@xmath54column density combination that best fit the observations at each temperature .",
    "again , comparing our @xmath0co column densities to the models of van dishoeck & black ( 1988 ) , we also determined the h@xmath6 column densities .",
    "the results of this lvg analysis will be presented in section [ subsec : a+m ] .    to test our assumption",
    "that the multiple velocity components seen in the complex were due to separate clouds rather than self - absorption in a single cloud , we also ran an extensive series of accelerated monte carlo ( amc ; hogerheijde & van der tak , 2000 ) models .",
    "amc models have the advantages of producing model spectra based on the input physical parameters of the cloud ( i.e. temperature , density and velocity gradient ) , and a greater available range of parameter space . while lvg models incorporate the simplifying assumption that the concentric model shells are radiatively decoupled , this is not the case for the more robust amc models .",
    "we first attempted to model the cloud as a single entity with a variety of density , temperature , abundance , and velocity gradients .",
    "some models , in which the abundance ratio was varied with a power law on the order of 0.5 came close to matching the @xmath0co spectra , but no single model ( for any position ) was able to match the @xmath0co and @xmath3co line profiles and ratios , despite attempts at varying the @xmath0co/@xmath3co abundance ratio .",
    "in addition , none of these models were capable of matching the shift in the red - blue asymmetry discussed previously . in all",
    ", we ran several thousand models .",
    "the total parameter space covered is shown in table [ tab : amcspace ] .",
    "column 1 shows the parameters that were varied and column 2 shows the range of central values used for each parameter .",
    "models were run as powerlaw functions of the form @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the value of the parameter ( abundance , temperature , density ) at some characteristic radius ( @xmath57 ) , @xmath58 is the power law index , and @xmath59 is the radius .",
    "@xmath58 was allowed to vary between -2 and + 2 , except for variations in the density for which @xmath60 would be unphysical .",
    "we also tried modeling each individual position as a separate and distinct `` cloudlet '' , with its own unique temperature , density and velocity gradients . again , none of the models were able to reproduce the spectra across the entire complex . therefore , we are reasonably confident that the multiple velocity components seen in the spectra are due to separate line of sight clouds .",
    "gibson et al . ( 2000 ) presented a preliminary view of hisa features seen in the cgps , finding a number of small scale hisa features that had not previously been seen in single - dish surveys .",
    "in more recent papers ( gibson et al .",
    "2005a & 2005b ) present a much more detailed view of hisa features through a re - analysis of the cgps data , using automated algorithms to locate hisa features in the hi data cube instead of the `` by - eye '' identification used in the earlier paper .",
    "in addition , gibson et al ( 2005b ) contains a revision of the hisa  data presented in g2000 . in the earlier paper the hisa  amplitudes were in error ; the correct hisa  amplitudes are lower than those listed in g2000 . in this section",
    "we use these improved hisa  observations and the technique presented in gibson et al .",
    "( 2000 ) to determine the physical properties of hisa   gas .",
    "the technique presented by g2000 allows one to constrain the physical properties of the hisa  gas in the complex and the globule by placing limits on the optical depth and spin temperature of the hisa  features .",
    "the optical depth of the hisa  can be determined through :    @xmath61    where @xmath62 is combination of constants for the hi spin - flip transition = 5.2@xmath63 ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) , @xmath64 is the line width , @xmath65 is the kinetic temperature of the gas which , under the assumptions of g2000 should be the same as @xmath66 , the hi spin temperature , and @xmath67 is the _ total _ column density ( i.e. @xmath68 ) .",
    "this analysis was able to find families of solutions based upon allowed ranges of the unknown atomic gas fraction ( @xmath69n(hi)/[n(hi ) + n(h@xmath6 ) ] ) and @xmath70 , the fraction of hi emission originating behind the hisa cloud .",
    "figure 6 of g2000 shows their results . even if we make the reasonable assumption that @xmath70 is close to unity , indicating that most of the cold hi is in the foreground as would be needed for strong hi self - absorption , the unknown atomic gas fraction still limits our ability to determine the amount and temperature of the hisa  gas .",
    "for example , figure 6 of g2000 shows that in the complex , if the hisa  is warm ( @xmath71 k ) then @xmath72 and the hisa  opacity ( @xmath73 ) is approximately 1 to 2 , whereas if the hisa  is cold ( @xmath74k ) then @xmath75 and @xmath73 is constrained to@xmath76 .    with our lvg analysis of the @xmath0co observations , we are able to better constrain the hisa  properties ( @xmath9 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 ) in the globule and complex , by finding the overlap between the original parameter space of g2000 and the parameter space defined by our @xmath0co observations . for the hisa  gas ,",
    "this was done according to the procedure detailed in g2000 but using the corrected data as given in gibson et al .",
    "2005b . for our @xmath0co observations , we took the derived h@xmath6 column density for each position ( section [ models ] ) and , using the above equation , calculated @xmath73 for a range of atomic gas fractions ( @xmath9 ) from 0.01 to 1 .",
    "figure [ fig : hisa ] shows an example for the globule in which we plot @xmath73 vs @xmath79 . for this figure we have assumed that n(h@xmath6 ) @xmath80 @xmath15 in our lvg calculation .",
    "the dotted curves show the values of @xmath70 , the thin , tilted strips ( starting at the upper - left corner of the plot ) show @xmath73 vs @xmath79 as determined from the gibson et al .",
    "( 2000 ) analysis of the hisa  features for a range of assumed atomic gas fraction ( @xmath9 ) , and the wider , tilted strips ( starting in the bottom - right corner of the plot ) show @xmath73 vs @xmath79 as determined from our @xmath0co analysis for a range of atomic gas fractions .",
    "the bold  sharkfin \"- shaped region shows the union of the hisa  and @xmath0co solutions for all values of @xmath9 , where each individual intersection is for a particular @xmath9 only .",
    "as can be seen from figure [ fig : hisa ] , the inclusion of the @xmath0co data significantly constrains the allowed range of physical conditions in the hisa  gas .",
    "the  sharkfin \" corresponds to a solution of 8 k @xmath81 k and @xmath82 .",
    "if we make the further assumption that @xmath83 ( i.e. that most of the hi emission is in the background as would be required to produce strong hisa  features ) , then @xmath84 .",
    "in addition , since the intersection of hisa  and @xmath0co solution also corresponds to an intersection of @xmath9 , we can constrain the atomic gas fraction , and find that @xmath85 . a similar analysis",
    "was done for assumed densities of @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xmath15 in the globule , and for each position in the complex .",
    "the results are given in table [ tab : hisa ] .",
    "note that no solutions were found for the complex - positions 1 & 2 .",
    "this is probably due to the presence of the strong second spectral feature . since the lvg analysis was done on the spectrally smoothed data ( to match the spectral resolution of the hisa  observations ) the two line - of - sight clouds are treated as a single component ( see figure [ fig : smoothco ] ) .",
    "the atomic gas fraction in positions 3 through 6 were found to be @xmath86 .",
    "the combination of the hisa  and molecular observations also allow us to better constrain the molecular gas density and column density since we now have a better constraint on the kinetic temperature .",
    "the results are given in table [ tab : molgas ] .",
    "given the small atomic gas fractions , the complex and the globule seem to be predominantly molecular in composition . while this seems obvious for the central positions in the complex where the @xmath0co lines are relatively strong , it is less obvious for position 6 , where the @xmath0co lines are weak",
    ". nevertheless our analysis suggests that @xmath87 90% of the gas is molecular .",
    "it is even more puzzling in the globule where the @xmath0co lines are undetectable and yet our limits on the @xmath0co column density suggest that up to 95% to 98% of the gas could be molecular .",
    "thus it is possible that the globule and the edge of the complex are regions where the gas has a large molecular component that is not well - traced by @xmath0co .",
    "there are , however , possible alternative explanations .",
    "gibson et al ( 2000 ) derived the spin temperature of the hisa  features via the equation    @xmath88    two main assumptions that go into producing equation ( 2 ) are : a ) the volume density is equal to the column density divided by the path length through the cloud ( @xmath89 ) and , b ) the volume density is related to the spin temperature through the ideal gas law . therefore , if either the gas pressure @xmath90 is below the canonical value of @xmath91 k @xmath15 , or the hisa  features are thinner along the line - of - sight than assumed by g2000 , then the atomic gas fraction would have to be larger than predicted to produce the same spin temperature",
    ". however , to produce gas which is primarily atomic ( i.e. @xmath72 ) would require either a large drop in gas pressure or significantly foreshortened clouds .",
    "while there is no evidence to support the hypothesis of significantly lower than average gas pressures , there is evidence to support the notion that observationally identified clouds may be preferentially _ elongated _ along the line of sight rather than foreshortened ( e.g. heiles 1997 ) due to observational selection effects .",
    "we can estimate the total mass contained in the 45@xmath31 beam of our fcrao @xmath0co @xmath92 observations from the solutions given above and using a distance to perseus of 2 kpc .",
    "the upper limit for the total gas mass in the globule ( m(hi ) + m(h@xmath6 ) ) is @xmath93 for the given range of temperatures , h@xmath6 column densities , and atomic gas fractions .",
    "this range is between 7 and 60 times lower than the jeans masses calculated for the globule for the given ranges of temperature and density .",
    "a similar calculation for the complex finds that each 45@xmath31 beam contains @xmath94 of material .",
    "this is again 7 to 60 times lower than the jeans mass implying that neither the globule nor the individual positions in the complex are gravitationally bound .",
    "so what are these hisa  clouds ?",
    "they appear to be non - gravitationally bound regions of cold , primarily molecular , gas that is not detected in @xmath0co .",
    "such regions are not unusual in high - latitude cirrus clouds and have been traced via excess ir emission ( e.g. heiles , reach , & koo 1988 ; reach , koo & heiles 1994 ) . however , most of the cirrus clouds in which @xmath0co does not seem to trace the total amount of molecular gas are relatively warm ( t@xmath95k ) , low density ( n(h@xmath6 ) @xmath19 @xmath15 ) regions in which the hi does not appear to be self absorbed .",
    "in contrast , the temperatures ( 10 k - 25 k ) and densities ( n(h@xmath6 ) @xmath96 @xmath15 ) in our hisa  clouds are similar to those seen in molecular clouds .",
    "thus , the hisa  gas has temperatures and densities that bridge the gap between the ambient atomic ism and the colder , denser molecular medium .",
    "could these hisa  clouds be sites where atomic gas is condensing into the molecular phase required for star formation ?",
    "although critical to the evolution of matter in the galaxy , molecular condensation is poorly understood . using a model that assumes that molecular clouds form from atomic gas after the passage of shock waves , bergin et al .",
    "( 2004 ) find that the molecular cloud formation timescale is not controlled by the formation rate of h@xmath6 on grains but , rather , by the shielding of molecules from the uv radiation .",
    "while the h@xmath6 can self - shield quite efficiently , @xmath0co formation requires shielding of the interstellar radiation by dust grains .",
    "if the total a@xmath97 is greater than @xmath98 then there is enough material present to effectively shield the @xmath0co .    using the 60 and 100 @xmath25 m iras hires data , we have estimated the dust temperature and the amount of visual extinction in the globule and at each of our observed positions in the complex .",
    "following the procedure outlined in wood et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , we calculated the dust temperature from the ratio of the 60 and 100 @xmath25 m fluxes , assuming that the dust is optically thin , that the 60 and 100 @xmath25 m beam solid angles are roughly equivalent , and that the dust emissivity spectral index is 1.5 .",
    "we find that the dust temperatures are all @xmath99k . if the dust is optically thin , knowing the temperature allows us to determine the 100 @xmath25 m dust opacity from the ratio of the observed 100 @xmath25 m flux to the planck function .",
    "the dust visual extinction was then calculated from the relationship between a@xmath97 and the 100 @xmath25 m dust opacity provided by wood et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , which is a functional fit to the data given in jarrett et al .",
    "( 1989 ) . in the complex , the dust visual extinction ranges from a@xmath97 = 3.8 at position 1 to a@xmath97 = 2.2 at position 6 . for positions 7 through 9 , a@xmath97 drops below 2 , as it does in the globule where a@xmath97 = 1.2 .",
    "note that these are the visual extinctions through the _ entire _ cloud .",
    "the edge - to - center visual extinctions , which are directly comparable to the bergin et al .",
    "( 2004 ) models , are half these values .",
    "thus , these results are consistent with the scenario given by bergin et al ( 2004 ) in which the absence of detectable @xmath0co in the globule , and in positions 7 - 9 of the complex , is due to the limited uv shielding provided by the dust in these regions .",
    "however , there could still be a considerable amount of molecular gas in positions 7 - 9 and in the globule , since h@xmath6 can form at considerably earlier times and lower column densities than @xmath0co .    since a@xmath97 in the globule and at the edge of the complex is close to the critical value needed to shield @xmath0co from the interstellar radiation field , it is possible that these regions are in the process of forming @xmath0co .",
    "thus , over time , @xmath0co lines may eventually become observable as the @xmath0co abundance continues to increase .",
    "bergin et al .",
    "( 2004 ) predict the observed intensities of various transitions as a function of time ( as clouds evolve from atomic to molecular ) . in their model ,",
    "a cloud with a @xmath0co @xmath100 line strength less that 0.06 k ( our 1@xmath39 detection limit ) would be less than @xmath101 years old .",
    "this `` age '' is consistent with the minimum transit time between spiral arms in the outer galaxy ( @xmath102 years ; heyer & tereby 1998 ) .",
    "an alternative scenario is that instead of being molecular clouds in the process of formation , the hisa  clouds could represent transient events , or even the dispersal of molecular clouds into the atomic medium .",
    "while we can not rule out these possibilities , the formation scenario seems more likely since the complex and the globule both seem to be correlated with a region slightly downstream of the spiral shock wave in the perseus arm ( gibson et al 2005 ; roberts 1972 ) where the gas is densest .",
    "this is precisely the type of region where we would expect h@xmath6 to be condensing from hi .",
    "using @xmath0co @xmath1 observations from the cso , and @xmath0co and @xmath3co @xmath2 observations from the fcrao , we have determined the molecular gas content in two regions of hi self - absorption ( hisa ) in perseus . in the globule",
    "we observed a small 8-point map at the cso to match the 45@xmath31 resolution , single - point @xmath2 observation taken with the fcrao . in the complex we observed a nine point strip from the center of the cloud to the edge of the cloud in increasing galactic latitude .",
    "no @xmath0co @xmath1 emission was detected in the globule to a 1@xmath39 rms limit of 0.06 k. @xmath0co was detected in positions 1 through 7 in the complex but fell below the 1@xmath39 rms noise limit in position 8 and 9 .",
    "positions 1 & 2 were found to contain two spectral features which we determined to be due to separate line - of - sight clouds rather than to @xmath0co self absorption .",
    "using both large velocity gradient and monte carlo radiative transfer codes , we were able to determine the molecular gas content in the globule and complex . in the globule n(@xmath0co ) @xmath4 @xmath5 , implying that n(h@xmath6 ) @xmath7 @xmath5 . in the complex we found that the h@xmath6 column densities ranged from @xmath8 @xmath5 .    by comparing the hisa  and @xmath0co observations we are able to constrain the physical conditions and atomic gas fraction ( @xmath9 ) of these two regions . in the globule , 8 k @xmath10 k and @xmath11 depending on whether the ( unknown ) gas density is @xmath12 , @xmath13 , or @xmath14 @xmath15 . in the complex ,",
    "12 k @xmath16 k , @xmath17 , and the gas density is constrained ( @xmath18 @xmath15 .",
    "these results imply that the gas in the hisa  clouds is colder and denser than that usually associated with the atomic ism and , indeed , is similar to that seen in molecular clouds .",
    "the small atomic gas fractions also imply that there is a significant molecular component in hisa  clouds , even when little or no @xmath0co is detected .",
    "the level of @xmath0co detected and the visual extinction due to dust is consistent with the idea that these hisa  clouds are undergoing a transition from the atomic to molecular phase .",
