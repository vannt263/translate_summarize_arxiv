    "cold atoms loaded into an optical lattice have opened up a new field dedicated to the study of quantum magnetism , which has been a long - standing problem in condensed matter physics @xcite . according to the well - known stoner criterion , the interaction strength and the band structure at the fermi energy determine whether the magnetic transitions occur or not .",
    "the key advantage of cold atoms over condensed matter is controllability of the interactions between atoms and the lattice geometry characterizing the energy band structure .",
    "these advantages encourage us to regard this system as a quantum simulator of magnetism . by controlling the interactions ,",
    "the mott transition of fermionic atoms has been successfully demonstrated @xcite , which is an important step in the investigation of quantum magnetism .",
    "in addition , recent experimental techniques allow us to create various complex lattices , such as honeycomb , kagom , lieb lattices @xcite .",
    "the lieb lattice is a prominent example of lattices that provide interesting topics related to magnetism .",
    "part of the energy band structure of this lattice is dispersionless , which is called a flat band .",
    "when the flat band is at the fermi energy , the magnetic transition can occur with infinitesimally small ( positive ) interactions because the density of states ( dos ) of atoms at the fermi energy is infinitely large .",
    "this strong instability toward the magnetic phase transition can be easily understood from the stoner criterion . from another point of view",
    ", the occurrence of the magnetic transition of this lattice has been mathematically demonstrated by lieb @xcite , in what is called the lieb theorem .",
    "although many theoretical studies on this flat - band magnetism have been performed @xcite , the experimental realization of this lattice has not yet been achieved in condensed matter .",

    "@xcite have theoretically proposed a laser configuration to construct a lieb optical lattice , and the kyoto university group has successfully achieved its construction @xcite .",
    "most of the previous studies on the lieb lattice have been done in two dimensions @xcite , whereas experiments will be performed in a three - dimensional laser configuration .",
    "a realistic lieb optical lattice structure is a stack of two - dimensional lattices .",
    "however , such a feature specific to cold atoms has not been well discussed .",
    "this stimulates us to investigate how the interlayer correlation affects the magnetism . on the other hand , in condensed matter",
    ", the layered materials are now attracting much interest thanks to the experimental progress in this field ; _ e.g. , _ hetero - structure materials of the correlated electron systems @xcite and multilayer graphene with control of the number of layers @xcite .",
    "various studies on such systems have clarified that multilayer systems contain rich physics beyond single - layer or bulk material @xcite .",
    "layered optical lattices @xcite can also be regarded as quantum simulators for investigating such a current topic in condensed matter .    in this study , we investigate the magnetic properties of two - component fermions in a multilayer lieb lattice at half filling and at zero temperature .",
    "we study the interlayer correlation effects in detail by systematically changing the number of layers .",
    "we elucidate that the magnetic processes for the even and odd number of layers are completely different when the interaction is small .",
    "this difference disappears when the number of layers is infinite , namely , at the three - dimensional limit .",
    "we also discuss how interlayer hopping affects the magnetism by changing the magnitude of this parameter .",
    "we find that this additional energy scale not included in the two - dimensional system characterizes whether or not an exotic crossover specific to the layered system occurs .",

    "we start by explaining the structure of the multilayer lieb lattices .",

    "the dotted square in fig.[fig_scpic](a ) represents the unit cell .",
    "figure[fig_scpic](b ) schematically describes the multilayer lattice with the number of layers @xmath7 of @xmath8 , where the sites in the unit cell are only shown . as illustrated in these figures , the multilayer lieb lattices are bipartite , where all sites can be classified into sublattice @xmath0 or @xmath1 that have inter - sublattice ( @xmath0-@xmath1 ) connections only while no intra - sublattice ( @xmath0-@xmath0 or @xmath1-@xmath1 ) connections .",
    "these sublattices are represented as ( red ) solid and ( green ) dashed circles in fig.[fig_scpic ] . in general , the magnetism in such bipartite structural lattices can be discussed on the basis of the lieb theorem .",
    "the lieb theorem states that , in bipartite lattices , two - component fermions show a finite magnetization with an infinitesimal repulsive interaction at half filling and at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the total magnetization is given by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) is the total number of the sites in sublattice @xmath12 .",
    "figure[fig_scpic ] clearly shows that , for the multilayer lieb lattice , sublattice @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) includes sites @xmath4 ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) in the odd - number - th layers and sites @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( @xmath4 ) in the even - number - th layers .",
    "the lieb theorem predicts that the values of @xmath13 per unit cell are @xmath14 for odd @xmath7 and @xmath15 for even @xmath7 in the multilayer lieb lattices .",

    "our present study is primary concerned about how the interlayer correlations induce the interesting phenomena beyond the predictions of the lieb theorem .",
    "we next show that layered lieb optical lattices can be derived straightforwardly from the ingenious configuration of lattice lasers . as discussed in refs.@xcite , the single - layer ( two - dimensional ) lieb lattice can be created by the potential @xmath16 $ ] , where @xmath17 is the lattice distance and @xmath18 is the lattice potential depths . the implementation of this complex potential requires several lasers with different wavelengths , _",

    "on the other hand , we usually apply the additional potential along the @xmath21 direction to confine cold atoms three - dimensionally in the real experiments . as a result ,",

    "( [ eq_pot ] ) , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , determine the intralayer and interlayer hopping amplitude , @xmath37 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "we assume the present hamiltonian to be uniform and neglect inhomogeneity due to the trapping potential , which will not change our results qualitatively and just modify them quantitatively .",
    "in this paper , we only consider the system at half filling without an external field and at zero temperature as a first step .",
    "we set @xmath38 as a unit of energy .    to clearly discuss the interlayer correlation effects on the flat - band magnetism",
    ", we investigate the @xmath7-layer lieb lattices as shown in fig.[fig_scpic](b ) by systematically changing the number of layers as @xmath39 . here",
    ", we set the periodic boundary conditions along the @xmath40 and @xmath41 directions , while an open boundary condition for the @xmath21 direction , which is a natural extension of our previous study for @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "we also investigate the system with @xmath43 , which corresponds to a three - dimensional layered lieb lattice with periodic conditions for all three directions .",
    "then , we discuss the asymptotic behaviour from finite to infinite layers , which will show dimensional crossover from the two ( @xmath42 ) to three dimensions ( @xmath43 ) through quasi - three dimensions ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "the two - dimensional lieb lattice can also be realized in the limit of @xmath45 .",
    "note that this limit is more realistic in experiments , which can be achieved by setting @xmath46 .",
    "however , we can at most create an ensemble of the two - dimensional lieb lattices , and the magnitude of @xmath24 , which is proportional to the laser intensity , is limited for some practical reasons , such as a limitation on the laser power .",
    "therefore , to study the effects of the interlayer correlations on such an ensemble , we investigate the present model hamiltonian by changing @xmath2 toward a small value .",
    "then , we discuss another dimensional crossover from the ( quasi-)three dimensions ( @xmath47 ) to the two dimensions ( @xmath48 ) .    the finite-@xmath7-layer systems can be implemented using the standard experimental techniques .",
    "one of the methods is the selection of the layers .",
    "for instance , the atoms except for those in the selected layers will be taken away from the lattice with the radio - frequency knife . another method without",
    "the loss of atoms is as follows .",
    "we can create an ensemble of the finite-@xmath7-layer lattices by superimposing extra lattice potentials with commensurate wavelengths along the @xmath21 direction .",
    "for example , the potential @xmath49 $ ] can provide the two - layer [ three - layer ] lieb lattice .",
    "these simple methods allow us to systematically study the interlayer correlation effects as will be discussed in sec.[sec_res ] .",
    "we use the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) @xcite to investigate the magnetic properties of multilayer lieb lattices . in the dmft framework , each site in the original lattice problem is mapped onto an impurity with hybridization from a dynamical heat bath that effectively describes a connection to surrounding sites . by solving this effective impurity problem in a self - consistent manner , we can precisely deal with local correlation effects , which are essentials for various quantum many - body phenomena , such as the mott transitions , magnetism , and superconductivity . in fact , the dmft used for layered systems @xcite has successfully demonstrated various phenomena experimentally observed in layered matter , such as a metal - insulator transition at the interface of a heterostructure of transition metal oxides @xcite .",
    "we comment about our application of dmft to the lieb lattice , which consists of different coordination number sites . with the infinitesimal interaction , our dmft calculations for magnetization , detailed in the next section , are consistent with analytical results described in appendix .",
    "this indicates that our dmft treatment is efficient to describe the flat - band ferromagnetism , which is one of the main topics of our paper .    to obtain actual dmft solutions ,",
    "the effective impurity problem should be solved with the aid of some numerical methods .",
    "the solver used in this study is the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) @xcite .",
    "this non - perturbative method can provide numerically exact solutions of the impurity problem in terms of thermodynamic properties at low temperatures .",
    "in addition , it can very accurately calculate the low - energy spectral properties at around the fermi energy .",
    "the spectral anomaly of the flat band just at the fermi energy is the origin of the instability toward magnetic ordering .",
    "thus , the nrg solver can capture the essence of the flat - band magnetism @xcite .    before detailing our dmft approach",
    ", we should mention the unit cells of the present lattices . a unit cell for the two - dimensional lieb lattice comprises the three sites shown in fig.[fig_scpic](a ) , and those for the @xmath7-layer lattices consist of @xmath50 sites .",
    "for @xmath43 , the unit cell reduces to @xmath51 sites because of the two - site - period translational symmetry along the @xmath21 direction resulting from the antiferromagnetic ordering along this direction .",
    "note that the ordering pattern we take into account in this study is easily determined from the fact that the layered lieb lattice is bipartite .",
    "the size of the unit cells determines the matrix dimensions of the green s function mentioned below .",
    "we explain our dmft calculations . here , we self - consistently calculate @xmath52 the local green s function of atoms with spin @xmath53 ) at the site @xmath54 ) on the @xmath31-th layer ( @xmath55 ) : @xmath56_{m\\gamma , m\\gamma},\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is a wave vector @xmath58 , and @xmath59 is the following matrix with a dimension of @xmath60 : @xmath61^{-1},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the matrix representation of the hamiltonians @xmath64 and the fourier transform of @xmath65 , respectively , and @xmath66 is the identity matrix .",

    "furthermore we set these self - energies to be zero at the first step of iterations . on the other hand , from the dyson equation",
    ", we obtain a cavity green s function @xcite : @xmath71^{-1},\\ ] ] which characterizes the dynamical heat bath connected to an effective impurity that corresponds to an atom with spin @xmath29 at site @xmath70 on the @xmath31-th layer in the original lattice . by solving such effective impurity problems with the nrg",

    "we perform these calculations repeatedly until convergence .",
    "note that each layer is described by the corresponding three effective impurity problems .",
    "our dmft formulation for multilayers , which have several sites in the unit cell , is an straightforward extension of the hubbard model with the antiferromagnetic order in bipartite lattices @xcite . for @xmath43",

    ", we can obtain these magnetizations from site- and spin - resolved observations of the number density , e.g. , which can be achieved by microscopy and/or spectroscopy .",
    "we also calculate the local dos of the atoms , @xmath78 , which describes the single particle excitation spectra .",
    "the local dos clearly explains various phenomena .",
    "for instance , the opening of a spectral gap clarifies the appearance of a metal - insulator transition .",

    "this difference in the flat - band structure is a key to the magnetism in multilayer lattices , as will be discussed in secs.[sec_odd ] and [ sec_even ] .",
    "generally , the dos for the odd - number - th layers in odd-@xmath7-layer lattices have the flat band at @xmath98 , while those for the even - number - th layers in odd-@xmath7-layer lattices and all of the layers in the even-@xmath7-layer lattices do not have the flat band at @xmath98 .",

    "@xmath115 , we find characteristic behaviour as follows : magnetization @xmath116 suddenly becomes a finite value of @xmath117 with the infinitesimal interaction ( @xmath99 ) , and then its magnitude continuously increases with increasing @xmath118 , whereas @xmath119 starts from zero and gradually grows as @xmath118 increases .",

    "the @xmath121-dependent magnetization processes result from the difference in the flat - band structures of the noninteracting dos as mentioned in sec.[sec_dos ] . because of the instability resulting from the flat band at the fermi energy , ferromagnetic ordering immediately occurs with the infinitesimal interaction @xmath99 in the first layer , which leads to a jump in @xmath116 at @xmath99 . on the other hand ,",
    "all sites in the second layer and also site @xmath4 in the first layer have no flat bands as shown in fig.[fig_ggdos](c ) .",
    "the magnetization on these sites is caused by the antiferromagnetic correlation between adjacent sites .",

    "the magnetic ordering for @xmath115 caused by the instability of the flat band triggers inter- and intra - layer antiferromagnetic correlations .",
    "0 such indirect correlations are effectively taken into account through the dmft self - consistent loop .",
    "namely , equation ( 7 ) describes that the global change of @xmath125 is caused by the local spin - dependent self - energies @xmath126 resulting from the local magnetization on the first layer ; as a result , the green s functions @xmath127 and @xmath128 and the effective impurity problems for all @xmath31 and @xmath70 can show spin dependence .    to further discuss the above magnetization process through the dynamical quantities , we calculate the local dos by changing interaction @xmath118 from weak to strong .",

    "we first focus on the dos for the weak interaction @xmath111 , which are shown in the second spectra from the top in fig.[fig_dos_3lay](a)-(d ) . by comparing these doss with those for @xmath131",
    ", we find that @xmath132 for @xmath111 shows split flat bands at around the fermi energy , which is clear evidence of the emergence of the ferromagnetic ordering .",
    "importantly , the flat bands away from the fermi energy are hardly split at all , suggesting that only one flat band just at the fermi energy can be regarded as the origin of the flat - band instability toward magnetism .",
    "we find that the other dos for @xmath111 also show the gapped structures at the fermi energy .",
    "however , note that these gap structures caused by another mechanism different from the flat - band instability .",
    "in fact , as shown in the insets , all gapped structures of the dos except for @xmath132 show van hove singularities at the edges of the gaps .",
    "the appearance of such band structures after the magnetic transition results from the change of the band structure ( band folding ) due to the symmetry breaking caused by the antiferromagnetic ordering . note that for @xmath42 we do not observe this singularity at gap edges @xcite because of the dirac - semi - metallic feature of the @xmath133 that has no dos at the fermi energy [ see fig.[fig_ggdos ] ( a ) ] .    in the insets of fig.[fig_dos_3lay ] , we find another interesting feature : the gap energies of the doss for the sites labeled @xmath115 and @xmath134 are larger than those for @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "the former ( latter ) sites are dominantly occupied @xmath137 atoms ( cf.fig.[fig_mag_3lay ] ) , and the total number of @xmath138-spin atoms are large as a result of the ferromagnetic ordering .",
    "these facts imply that the majority atoms with @xmath139 require a larger energy for the single particle excitation than the minorities .",
    "this feature can be seen only in the weakly interacting region as mentioned below .",
    "as @xmath118 increases , for @xmath140 and @xmath130 , the dos for all sites loses the detailed structures and finally exhibit similar structures that recall upper and lower hubbard bands .",
    "the change in the band structures indicates that the mechanism of the magnetic ordering changes from the flat - band picture to the localized heisenberg picture , as discussed in the previous study @xcite .",
    "the occurrence of this crossover can be confirmed from the magnetizations in fig.[fig_mag_3lay ] , where @xmath80 for the strongly interacting region ( @xmath141 ) shows saturation behaviour .",
    "we note that , in contrast to the weakly interacting region , the dos for the strongly interacting one shows no gap - energy difference depending on the site .",
    "we should comment that the magnetism in the general - odd-@xmath7 layers can be understood from the simple extension of the above discussions .",
    "this is because , qualitatively , the keys to the magnetism are the flat - band structures as mentioned in sec.[sec_dos ] . the quantitative difference will be discussed below in sec.[sec_l_dep ] , which also addresses the important question how the magnetism is on the infinite - layer lattice ( @xmath43 ) .       on @xmath142-th layer in the two - layer system ( @xmath82 ) with @xmath84 .",

    "the following discussion can be easily extended to general even-@xmath7-layer lattices in the same manner as the odd-@xmath7 case .",

    "the magnetization @xmath80 stays zero for the weakly interacting region , and it becomes finite at critical interaction @xmath148 , where a magnetic transition occurs .",
    "the suppression of the magnetic ordering for @xmath149 is a consequence of the following facts : since the dos for all @xmath121 have no flat bands at the fermi energy as discussed in sec.[sec_dos ] , there is no flat band instability toward magnetic ordering for small @xmath118 .",
