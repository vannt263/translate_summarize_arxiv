    "the unification of general relativity ( gr ) with quantum mechanics ( qm ) , ultimately with quantum field theory , is one of the fundamental open problems of theoretical physics . at present not only",
    "the unification is missing , but basic concepts of gr are incongruous with those of  qm .",
    "one of the incompatibilities lies between the sharply determined structure of the einsteinian space - time on the one hand and the quantum mechanical uncertainties of the positions and of the momenta of the bodies determining that structure on the other hand .    since both theories are experimentally verified with a high degree of accuracy , when seeking to discard the said incompatibility one should try to modify the theories as little as possible .",
    "f. karolyhazy was probably the first to show how this can be done .",
    "he noticed that relying only on basic relations of gr and qm themselves one can assess the order of magnitude of the minimal amount of uncertainty to be associated with the space - time structure making that structure compatible with qm .",
    "namely , he has shown in @xcite that the length @xmath0 of a time interval along a @xmath1 worldline of an inertial frame of reference has a minimal uncertainty @xmath2 proportional to @xmath3 : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the planck time . in the symbol `` @xmath6",
    "'' stands for `` equal in order of magnitude '' , in @xmath7 is the newtonian gravitational constant .",
    "recently y. j. ng and h. van dam rediscovered the space - time uncertainty relation and established a companion relation @xmath8 they refer to them as `` space - time foam '' relations @xcite , @xcite . in @xmath9",
    "is a spatial distance , @xmath10 is its uncertainty and @xmath11 is the planck length .",
    "( to make easy the comparison of the formulas of the present note with those in the publications of karolyhazy on the one hand and of ng and van dam on the other hand , notations of the respective author(s ) have been adopted .",
    "this is why an uncertainty is denoted by @xmath12 in and by @xmath13 in . )",
    "it should be noted that because of the extreme smallness of @xmath14 and @xmath15 the possibility of a direct experimental verification of the space - time foam formulas and is questionable .",
    "a short exposition of this problem is given in the concluding section  [ sec:8 ] below .",
    "it is also recalled there that the uncertainties @xmath2 and @xmath10 , if they exist , have various far reaching indirect observable consequences , in particular they induce the decoherence of the wave functions of the macroscopic bodies . these features",
    "underline the importance of the reliability of the deduction of relations and .",
    "the purpose of the present note is to give a critical survey of their derivations .    in sections",
    "[ sec:2 ] and [ sec:3 ] two different ways of deriving relation , given in @xcite and @xcite respectively , are recalled with the addition of some points not spelled out in those papers . in section  [ sec:4 ] a derivation of formula is presented in which instead of karolyhazy s quantum clock with a hand of non - zero rest mass the light - handed quantum clock proposed by ng in @xcite is used . in sections",
    "[ sec:5 ] and [ sec:6 ] objections are made to some steps of the derivations of the space - time foam formula given respectively in @xcite and @xcite . in section  [ sec:7 ]",
    "it is shown that this formula can be obtained as a consequence of formula  .",
    "section  [ sec:8 ] is devoted to concluding remarks .",
    "in @xcite it has been argued that qm and gr jointly prevent the perfect implementation of a worldline segment of an inertial reference frame . the assessment of the order of magnitude of the minimal uncertainty of the implementation has been carried out as follows .",
    "let a spherical homogeneous body be at rest in such a frame .",
    "qm says ( see e.g.  @xcite ) that during a time interval @xmath0 the order of magnitude of the minimal uncertainty @xmath16 of the position of the center of mass ( c.m . )",
    "is @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the mass of the body .",
    "the same statement holds , of course , for @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "so , instead of a concise worldline segment , in qm one gets a segment the position of which is undetermined within a worldtube of thickness @xmath21 .    the positional uncertainty of the c.m .",
    "makes the positions of the constituents of the body uncertain in the same degree .",
    "the thickness of the worldtube inside which there are uncertain positions remains of the order @xmath16 if the diameter @xmath22 of the body is not larger than @xmath16 : @xmath23    qm alone would allow to make @xmath16 as small as desired taking a body of sufficiently large mass .",
    "however , with increasing mass the schwarzschild radius @xmath24 of the body increases , too . from and one sees that from the product @xmath25 the mass drops out , this product depends only on  @xmath0 . for a given value of @xmath0 @xmath16 and @xmath26 work against each other .",
    "when one of them increases the other one decreases .    in order to prevent the body of disappearing behind its schwarzschild horizon , @xmath27 should not be smaller than  @xmath26 . taking into account , too , one comes to the inequalities @xmath28 the minimal value of the uncertainty @xmath16 is therefore @xmath29 , and then from one finds that @xmath30 ( a factor @xmath31 has been lumped into the `` @xmath6 '' symbol ) .",
    "a remark to be kept in mind throughout the present paper seems to be in order here .",
    "when seeking for minimal modifications which reconcile gr with qm one has to work with relations at the borderline of the validity of these theories .",
    "for example is a relation of non - relativistic qm and it is not granted that it holds in the vicinity of the schwarzschild sphere , i.e.  at the value @xmath32 considered above .",
    "it would have been possible to put in e.g.  @xmath33 instead of @xmath29 .",
    "then instead of one would come to the relation @xmath34 this would not change the main message , namely that the minimal spatial uncertainty is not simply @xmath35 .",
    "the uncertainty is increasing proportionally to @xmath36 , and if @xmath37 , then @xmath16 is considerably larger than @xmath15 .",
    "for instance for @xmath38 @xmath16 is of the order of @xmath39  cm , a microscopic value , but indeed considerably larger than @xmath15 .    establishes a relation between the length @xmath0 of a time interval along a @xmath1 worldline and the minimal spatial uncertainty @xmath16 in the position of that segment of the worldline .",
    "karolyhazy claims in @xcite that @xmath40 can be regarded also as the measure of indefiniteness of the end points as well as of the length of the segment @xmath0 .",
    "this standpoint rests on the following argument .",
    "the accuracy of the evaluation of the moments of time is affected by the uncertainty @xmath16 of the thickness of the worldtube .",
    "in particular , this is true also for the moments when @xmath0 begins and ends .",
    "if the evaluation is carried out with the help of a light signal , then the imprecision in the said moments is @xmath41 with a slower signal @xmath2 would be larger . with one arrives from at the space - time uncertainty relation  .",
    "( there is an obvious misprint in the corresponding formula ( 3.1 ) in  @xcite .",
    "the last exponent on the r.h.s .",
    "should be @xmath42 instead of @xmath43 . )    in a subsequent paper @xcite recalled in the next section karolyhazy has given a derivation of formula in which a worldline segment is implemented by a quantum clock instead of a homogeneous solid body .",
    "then the time uncertainty @xmath2 comes in more directly than above , namely there is no need in its evaluation through a positional uncertainty  @xmath16 .",
    "the clock in question consists of a homogeneous spherical body ( the hand ) of mass @xmath18 and of radius @xmath27 enclosed in a much more massive homogeneous spherical shell ( the dial ) of inner radius @xmath44 @xmath45 . in order to work as a clock the hand and the dial should oscillate against each other .",
    "the clock as a whole is free , thus it is exempt of outer influences .    in qm",
    "the desired oscillation takes place if the state of the clock is the superposition of two ( or more ) energy eigenstates of different energies .",
    "calculations @xcite have shown that the ground energy and the next energy level of this realistic quantum clock are well represented , except for unimportant numerical factors of the order of the unity , by the corresponding levels of a much simpler one - dimensional quantum clock model considered by karolyhazy in @xcite . there",
    "the hand is a body of mass @xmath18 enclosed in an infinitely high potential well ( the dial ) of width  @xmath46 .",
    "the two lowest energy levels @xmath47 and the corresponding eigenstates are ( see e.g.  @xcite ) @xmath48 if the state of the hand at @xmath49 is @xmath50 then at @xmath51 it will be @xmath52 except for the unimportant phase factor @xmath53 the hand is periodically coming back to the initial state @xmath54 with period @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the energy uncertainty . accordingly the clock is tick - tacking between the states @xmath54 and @xmath57 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) with period @xmath58 . this is the time uncertainty ( the accuracy ) @xmath2 of the clock . from and one sees that @xmath59        @xmath54 :  ; @xmath60 : to13 mm    let us now look for the condition securing a non - relativistic regime .",
    "the average energy @xmath61 of the hand during a period is @xmath62 in the interval @xmath63 $ ] @xmath64 , therefore @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the average kinetic energy of the hand .    from and one sees that @xmath47 and @xmath67 are also of that order of magnitude : @xmath68",
    "therefore the condition for the non - relativistic regime is @xmath69    the order of magnitude relations derived for the one - dimensional model hold also , except for numerical factors of the order of the unity , for the realistic three - dimensional quantum clock described above . from now on the considerations refer to the realistic clock .",
    "the time uncertainty @xmath2 in is of purely quantum mechanical origin .",
    "it has been noticed by karolyhazy in @xcite that gr and qm jointly induce an additional time uncertainty to be denoted here by @xmath70 .",
    "it arises in the following way .    in the gravitational field of the hand",
    "the relation between the length @xmath71 of a time interval evaluated on the surface of the hand and the length @xmath0 of the corresponding time interval far away from the clock ( i.e.  in flat space - time ) reads @xmath72 where @xmath26 is the schwarzschild radius of the hand .",
    "here it has been taken into account that the dial is an outer homogeneous spherical shell practically at rest , therefore it does not disturb significantly the schwarzschild metric inside the shell .    as we shall see shortly , the relevant value of @xmath27 is much larger than @xmath26 .",
    "therefore in good approximation @xmath73    in the case of a spherically symmetric body at rest @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the rest energy of the body .",
    "if the body contains moving parts and/or inner energies , then @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the full energy . since @xmath47 and @xmath66 are much smaller than @xmath75 , in post - newtonian approximation",
    "@xmath78  @xcite .",
    "@xmath79 is the mean binding energy . in @xmath26 itself @xmath66 and @xmath61",
    "can be neglected besides the rest energy . however , the rest energy has no uncertainty while the full energy has , namely it is given by @xmath67 in .",
    "thus from and one finds that @xmath80 where @xmath2 is expressed by , and @xmath81 from one sees that @xmath82 therefore @xmath83    if the size @xmath27 of the hand could be arbitrarily large then @xmath70 could be made vanishingly small .",
    "however , as argued in @xcite , the force moving the hand back and forth acts locally , and its effect should reach the opposite end of the hand during the oscillation period @xmath84 .",
    "therefore the order of magnitude of @xmath27 can not be larger than @xmath85 , @xmath86 and then @xmath87 from one finds that for a given value of @xmath0  @xmath88 is minimal when the space - time uncertainty relation   @xmath89 holds , and then @xmath90 holds , too .",
    "it remains to show that with @xmath91 the condition @xmath92 assumed when passing from to is indeed fulfilled . from one",
    "sees that @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the compton wavelength associated with the mass  @xmath18 .",
    "thus is equivalent to the relation @xmath95 and @xmath96 should hold for any physically acceptable value of  @xmath46 . also , from and it follows that @xmath97 and this relation is equivalent to @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the planck mass . since @xmath100 , holds for a large domain of mass values",
    "in @xcite ng has deduced the space - time foam formula relying on a quantum clock the hand of which is a light wave packet . it is argued in section  [ sec:6 ] below that a point of the derivation given by him is objectionable . in the present section relation",
    "is deduced making use of the clock proposed by ng .",
    "the time uncertainty @xmath70 of karolyhazy quoted in comes in again , but now the argument leading to the conclusion that the maximal size of the hand is @xmath101 becomes superfluous , because the size of the hand of ng s clock is @xmath102 from the outset .",
    "the clock proposed in @xcite consists of a thin homogeneous spherical shell ( the dial ) of mass @xmath18 and inner diameter @xmath103 , and of a wave packet of light ( the hand ) reflected back and forth by the inner mirror surface of the dial along one of its diameters .",
    "more precisely , in order to make the clock as a whole free , the hand and the dial should oscillate against each other with the c.m .  of the clock at rest .",
    "the time uncertainty of the clock is then @xmath104 more exactly @xmath105 , but we demand that the velocity @xmath106 of the dial be non - relativistic , @xmath107    since both the hand and the dial are quantum objects , their position and momentum have uncertainties .",
    "the positional uncertainty @xmath108 of the light wave packet in the direction of its motion should not be larger than the diameter of the dial , otherwise no distinguishable tick - tacking would be possible . from @xmath109",
    "it follows that for a minimal wave packet @xmath110 ( the notation @xmath108 instead of @xmath111 takes into account that photons have no coordinate operator @xmath112 @xcite . )    in order to have a definite orientation of motion instead of spreading in opposite directions , the average momentum @xmath113 of the packet should not be smaller than @xmath114 : @xmath115 furthermore , since the c.m .  of",
    "the clock is at rest , one has @xmath116 and in magnitude @xmath117 the condition @xmath118 secures not only that the kinetic energy @xmath119 of the dial is much - much smaller than its rest mass @xmath120 but also that the energy @xmath121 of the hand , although much larger than @xmath119 , is still much smaller than @xmath122 . indeed , making use of , @xmath123    the argument concerning the uncertainty of the length of a time interval in curved space - time is similar to that in the preceding section .",
    "the relation between @xmath71 assessed on the outer surface of the dial ( we recall that the dial is a thin spherical shell of inner diameter @xmath103 ) and the length @xmath0 of the corresponding time interval in flat space now reads @xmath124 here the inequality @xmath125 has been assumed .",
    "it will be shown shortly that it holds",
    ".    with one finds that @xmath126 where now the full energy @xmath77 is @xmath127 as noticed already , @xmath119 and @xmath121 are much smaller than @xmath122 .",
    "but while the latter has no uncertainty , @xmath128 has .",
    "therefore @xmath129 where @xmath130 from it follows that @xmath131 therefore @xmath132 dominates in @xmath67 , and with @xmath133 thus becomes @xmath134 ( a factor @xmath135 has been lumped into the `` @xmath6 '' symbol ) .",
    "with one arrives at the relation of the preceding section @xmath136 leading to the space - time uncertainty formula  .",
    "we still have to show that the condition @xmath137 assumed above holds .",
    "since now @xmath138 , with relation   @xmath139 furthermore , since @xmath122 is much larger than @xmath119 and @xmath121 , the condition @xmath137 gives @xmath140 it has been shown in the preceding section that this inequality is fulfilled for a large domain of mass values .",
    "in this section sub i ) the the line of thought of the derivation given in @xcite is recalled , in ii ) a comment is made .",
    "\\i ) in @xcite it is proposed to measure the distance @xmath9 between a quantum clock and a mirror through the travel time @xmath141 of a light signal emitted at the clock and reflected back to it by the mirror .",
    "the moments when the signal starts and arrives back are registered by the clock .",
    "obviously @xmath142    the uncertainty @xmath10 in the value of @xmath9 is related to the uncertainty @xmath16 in the position of the clock . ( the uncertainty caused by the mirror is supposed to be of the same order of magnitude . ) in @xcite @xmath10 is taken to be equal to @xmath16 , @xmath143 because `` the clock is the agent in measuring the length '' .    to keep the order of magnitude of @xmath16 minimal during the time interval",
    "@xmath141 the relation between @xmath16 and @xmath141 should be ( see eq . above ) @xmath144 if holds then also @xmath145 @xmath10 could be made arbitrarily small taking a sufficiently large mass  @xmath18 .",
    "however , as recalled in @xcite , the gravitational deviation @xmath146 of the distance @xmath9 from its flat space value according to gr is @xmath147 from the product @xmath148 the mass @xmath18 drops out , the product depends only on  @xmath9 . for a fixed value of @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath146 work against each other .",
    "when one of them increases the other one decreases .",
    "the minimal overall departure from the classical value of @xmath9 occurs when @xmath149 and then goes over into the space - time foam formula @xmath150    \\ii ) comment    the relation between @xmath10 and @xmath16 is not simply @xmath151 .",
    "since the distance @xmath9 is measured through the time interval @xmath141 registered by the clock , from @xmath152 it follows that @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the uncertainty ( called also `` the accuracy '' ) of the clock . as to the relation between @xmath154 and the uncertainty @xmath16 in the position of the clock , it depends on the properties of the clock . in @xcite these properties",
    "are not described , but the authors refer to the salecker  wigner clock  @xcite . there the hand of the clock is moving freely with velocity  @xmath155",
    ". then @xmath156 the time needed for the hand to reach successive distinguishable positions . from and it follows that @xmath157 therefore for a non - relativistic motion of the hand @xmath10 is not equal , but is much larger than @xmath16 . with instead of @xmath151 one sees from that @xmath158 then @xmath159 , and @xmath160 leads to @xmath161 a formula according to which the minimal value of @xmath10 depends not only on @xmath9 but also on the velocity  @xmath155 .",
    "this @xmath10 is @xmath162 times larger than the @xmath10 of the space - time foam formula  .      in section  [ sec:4 ] above it has been shown how to arrive at the space - time uncertainty relation making use of the light - handed quantum clock proposed in @xcite . in the present section sub i ) the derivation leading to the space - time foam formula  , exposed by ng in @xcite ,",
    "is recalled and sub ii ) a comment is made .    in @xcite",
    "it is proposed to measure with the help of a light signal the distance @xmath9 between the light - handed clock described in section  [ sec:4 ] above and a mirror .",
    "the relation between the time interval @xmath141 needed for the signal to travel from the clock to the mirror and back to the clock is again @xmath163    like in @xcite , in @xcite , too , the uncertainty @xmath10 of @xmath9 is taken to be equal to the uncertainty @xmath16 of the position of the c.m .  of the clock , @xmath164 ( it has been shown in section  [ sec:4 ] above that the energy @xmath121 of the light - hand is much smaller than the rest energy @xmath122 of the dial ( see eq .  ) , therefore the c.m .  of",
    "the clock is practically the c.m .  of the dial . )",
    "the relation @xmath165 guarantees that @xmath16 is minimal during the time interval  @xmath141 . from it follows that @xmath166 holds , too .",
    "furthermore implies that @xmath167 where now @xmath168 is the time uncertainty ( the accuracy ) of the light - handed clock .",
    "thus the relation between @xmath10 and @xmath103 is @xmath169 ( in @xcite instead of the relation @xmath170 has been advocated .",
    "pedantically and are different , but in order of magnitude they are compatible . )    the radius @xmath171 of the dial should not be smaller than its schwarzschild radius @xmath26 , @xmath172 otherwise the hand would disappear behind the schwarzschild horizon of the dial .",
    "the product of with gives the space - time foam formula @xmath173    \\ii ) comment    as shown above , in the case of the light - handed clock the uncertainty @xmath10 is related to the diameter of the dial : @xmath174 .",
    "this relation is not compatible without further ado with the statement in @xcite that @xmath151 .",
    "the disagreement can be seen from the fact that @xmath16 increases with the time @xmath141 ( see eq .  ) , whereas @xmath174 is time independent , the diameter @xmath103 does not change .",
    "the accuracy @xmath175 of the clock , and with it @xmath176 depends only on the relative motion of the hand with respect to the dial , and this motion is not affected by the growth of the uncertainty @xmath16 of the position of the c.m .. that growth says that the c.m .",
    "is present with appreciable probability in an expanding region , but the accuracy @xmath154 is not worsening and consequently @xmath10 is not increasing . therefore",
    "the use of the relation @xmath177 in the framework of the line of thought followed in @xcite is not well founded .",
    "the space - time foam formula can be obtained without relying on the relation @xmath177 from the outset .",
    "similarly to the case of the constituents of the body considered in section  [ sec:2 ] above , the constituents of the dial inherit the uncertainty @xmath16 of the c.m .. the thickness of the worldtube where the positions are uncertain remains @xmath16 if the diameter of the dial is not larger : @xmath178 ( recall that the dial is a thin shell ) .    according to @xmath16 could be made as small as desired taking a sufficiently large mass .",
    "however , then the schwarzschild radius @xmath179 increases , too .",
    "similarly to in the product @xmath180 @xmath16 and @xmath26 work against each other .",
    "furthermore , one has to demand that the radius @xmath171 of the dial be not smaller than  @xmath26 , @xmath181 in order to prevent the hand of disappearing behind the schwarzschild horizon of the dial . from and",
    "it follows that the order of magnitude of the minimal value of @xmath16 is @xmath26 , and then goes over into the space - time foam formula .",
    "notice that now @xmath182 holds , too , and since @xmath174 one comes finally to @xmath183 , but this is the result of a special choice of the value of @xmath16 , this relation is not valid from the start .",
    "in order to evaluate the distance @xmath9 between two bodies a and b at rest , a light signal is sent from a to b and is reflected back to  a. from the time of flight @xmath141 of the signal one obtains  @xmath9 : @xmath184    according to the space - time uncertainty formula the uncertainty @xmath154 of the time interval  @xmath141 is @xmath185 and @xmath154 induces an uncertainty in @xmath9 . from @xmath186 from , and one finds that the space - time foam formula @xmath187 for spacial distances follows from the formula for time intervals ( and vice - versa , but this does not mean that independent derivations of these formulas are unimportant ) .",
    "the three derivations presented in sections  [ sec:2 ] , [ sec:3 ] and [ sec:4 ] support the validity of the space - time uncertainty relation  .",
    "attention should be paid to the following property of this formula : all the parameters of the objects used in the derivations dropped out from the final result , the formula contains only the planck time connecting the length of a time interval with the uncertainty of that length .",
    "this fact suggests that relation says something about a property of space - time itself .",
    "as noticed by karolyhazy in @xcite , `` the formula suggests that perfection in spacetime structure is not a justifiable idealization and that this structure must not be specified more accurately than is permitted by the above indefiniteness '' .",
    "a similar remark applies also to the space - time foam formula .",
    "this is the view of ng and van dam , too , who say in @xcite that the formula expresses an `` intrinsic uncertainty in space - time measurements '' .",
    "there is a difference of opinion concerning the basis of the derivation of the space - time foam relations . in @xcite and @xcite",
    "ng and van dam speak of the measurement of a distance  @xmath9 , while in @xcite karolyhazy notices that the space - time foam formula is derived not from ( thought ) experiments but from a juxtaposition of basic concepts of gr and qm .",
    "the present author thinks that from the derivations exposed in the previous sections it is clear that the space - time foam relations and arise , as advocated by karolyhazy , from an attempt to make gr and qm compatible with each other , a requirement of consistency on its own right .",
    "also it should be noted that if the measurement would be essential for the validity of the space - time foam formulas , then one should have shown that the measuring process does not increase the uncertainties .",
    "however , in @xcite and @xcite the possible growth of @xmath10 caused by the reading of the quantum clock is not examined , the measuring process is not touched upon in those papers .    as already mentioned in the introduction , because of the extreme smallness of the planck constants @xmath14 and @xmath15 the possibility of a direct experimental verification of the space - time foam formulas is questionable",
    "indeed , either @xmath141 ( and @xmath9 ) are too large , or @xmath154 ( and @xmath10 ) are too small to be kept under control . still , various possibilities of the direct experimental verification have been explored , among others in a review paper by amelino - camelia @xcite . as a matter of fact",
    "he has analyzed the problem of the observability of @xmath10 for the larger class of space - time foam formulas @xmath188 where the parameter @xmath189 takes values in the interval @xmath190 and @xmath191 is a characteristic length of quantum gravity , but not necessarily the planck length .",
    "the space - time foam formula corresponds to the case @xmath192    as argued in @xcite , the best instruments for discovering the tiny uncertainty @xmath10 are the gravitational wave interferometers .",
    "the caltech 40-meter interferometer gave only that @xmath193 a limit still very far from @xmath194  cm .",
    "however , the `` advanced phase '' of ligo ( the laser interferometric gravitational wave observatory ) should be able to probe @xmath195 values as small as @xmath196  cm , already close to @xmath15 .",
    "an important indirect manifestation of the tiny structural uncertainty of the space - time structure is the decoherence of the schrodinger wave functions of macroscopic bodies . as shown by karolyhazy @xcite ( for an exposition in english",
    "see @xcite and @xcite ) the uncertainty @xmath154 induces uncertainties in the relative phases of the wave function of any physical system , small or large , propagating on the slightly `` hazy '' space - time . for simple but important systems",
    "the order of magnitude of the relative phase uncertainties is calculable . for microsystems ( for an electron , for an atom",
    ", for a molecule ,  ) these uncertainties are negligible . however ,",
    "for solid macroscopic bodies the coherence gets lost ( i.e.  the uncertainties of the relative phases reach the value  @xmath197 ) .",
    "for example for a homogeneous marble of 1  gram and of radius of 1  cm the coherence is destroyed as soon as the quantum mechanical positional uncertainty of the c.m",

    "inside which the coherence is still not lost , and from there it expands again as dictated by the schrodinger equation until a new shrinkage becomes necessary , karolyhazy has come to a dynamics which maintains the position of a macroscopic body well localized due to the breakdowns of the superposition principle at each stochastic shrinkage .",
    "there is no more need in a classical measuring apparatus or in a conscious observer to produce the breakdowns . for a comparison of karolyhazy s modified quantum dynamics with that of ghirardi , rimini and weber @xcite see @xcite .    a new , in principle observable phenomenon",
    "is also predicted by this theoretical construct .",
    "each stochastic shrinkage of the wave function produces a small , stochastic increase of the momentum , and their succession leads to an `` anomalous brownian motion '' ( abm ) of the body @xcite , @xcite . as a result the `` classical '' limit of the motion of the c.m .  of a free solid body",
    "is not the newtonian straight trajectory .",
    "there are tiny stochastic deviations from it which accumulate as time goes on .",
    "the abm is a manifestation of the quantum character of a macroscopic body . in everyday circumstances",
    "the effect of the abm is washed out by the interactions of the body with its surroundings , but under special conditions @xcite it may become observable .",
    "it should be noted that in @xcite in the analysis of the possibilities of a direct observation of @xmath10 the influence of the abm on the mirrors of the gravitational wave interferometer has not been taken into account .",
    "a noteworthy property of the space - time foam formula has been emphasized by ng in  @xcite .",
    "he has shown that there is a connection between this formula and the holographic principle , which in its turn is related to black hole physics .",
    "this connection enlarges the field where the uncertainty of the space - time structure may play a role .",
    "the space - time foam formulas and have been obtained from relations of non - relativistic @xmath199 qm and gr .",
    "if these formulas are correct , the genuine unification of relativistic quantum field theory with gr should reproduce them in the non - relativistic limit . in its turn",
