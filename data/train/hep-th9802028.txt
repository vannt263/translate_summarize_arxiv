    "the action for the gravitational field is _ not _ scale invariant , and so large fluctuations in the metric over short length scales will not have a large action .",
    "such fluctuations are therefore not precluded since they are not damped in the path integral , and indeed even variations in topology may occur since these would further increase the associated action by only an arbitrarily small amount . such considerations led wheeler  @xcite to suggest that in a quantum theory of gravity , spacetime should be expected to have a ` foam - like ' structure on scales of the planck length or shorter , in which both the metric and the topology of the manifold may vary considerably . on larger scales however , spacetime would appear smooth and continuous , reverting to the manifold structure more conventionally associated with the treatment of classical general relativity .    hawking  @xcite and hawking , page & pope  @xcite first interpreted this foam structure as made from ` quantum gravitational bubbles ' arising in three topological varieties :",
    "@xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 .",
    "these would be the ` building blocks ' of spacetime ,  not themselves solutions to any field equations but rather occuring as quantum fluctuations .",
    "their non - trivial topologies do not allow complete foliation of the manifolds with a family of non - intersecting time surfaces , and consequently green functions defined on them are bound to exhibit certain acausal and frequency mixing properties more commonly associated with those defined on the euclidean black hole metrics .",
    "the interpretation of these bubbles as virtual ( or off - shell ) black holes , which materialise out of the vacuum and subsequently vanish again , would therefore appear well justified .",
    "quantum field theories defined on manifolds with non - trivial topology are necessarily non - unitary , the consequences of which include the loss of information and of quantum coherence . if spacetime is indeed composed of planck scale building blocks with non - trivial topologies , then quantum fields propagating in it ought to suffer from these effects .",
    "such a notion may navely appear to be somewhat at odds with observation !",
    "theories relying on unitary evolution and conserved quantum coherence have been demonstrated to high degrees of accuracy , and yet the quantum bubbles picture would seem to advocate the loss of quantum coherence for fields propagating in spacetime due to their unavoidable interaction with planck scale fluctuations . how may these apparent contradictions be reconciled ?",
    "calculations in simple @xmath9 and @xmath7 models  @xcite indicated that the non - trivial topologies of the quantum bubbles induced additional singularities into the green functions for particle propagators .",
    "these tended to make large contributions to the _ s_-matrix in the scalar case , but only very small contributions in higher spin cases for energies low with respect to the planck scale . in a sense then , the reconciliation is complete since all observed elementary particles have spin greater than zero .",
    "it is therefore hardly surprising that spacetime should appear smooth and nearly flat at current observational energies , since the only available probes of its structure are essentially blind to its short scale fluctuations .",
    "consideration of the pair creation of black holes led hawking  @xcite to reconsider the original interpretation of spacetime foam .",
    "gibbons  @xcite had suggested that the pair creation of real black holes in a background field could be described by the ernst solution  @xcite and its dilaton generalisations, the euclidean section of which has topology @xmath10 . by analogy with the pair creation of ordinary particles , this topology corresponds to a black hole loop in a spacetime asymptotic to @xmath11 .",
    "however , @xmath10 may also be considered as the topological sum of the compact space @xmath9 and the non - compact space @xmath11 , leading to a reinterpretation of the @xmath9 bubbles in the spacetime foam as closed loops of virtual black holes .",
    "thus , rather than a single off - shell black hole , the quantum bubbles are to be thought of as virtual black holes appearing and annihilating in pairs .",
    "if this should occur , then it seems plausible that incident particles could be absorbed and subsequently re - emitted  possibly as different particles , and with loss of quantum coherence .    adopting the perspective that the compact @xmath9 bubbles occur as quantum fluctuations unaffected by incident low energy particles , a consistent scheme for estimating the scattering amplitude and loss of coherence",
    "may be constructed  @xcite .",
    "this involves computing the euclidean green function in an asymptotically euclidean metric on @xmath12 , analytically continuing to the lorentzian section at infinity , and integrating with the initial and final state wave functions of the scattered field .",
    "weighting the result according to the action of the euclidean metric gives the scattering amplitude , which should then be integrated over all asymptotically euclidean metrics .",
    "however this scheme is effectively intractable since neither the calculation of the green function in a general metric or the path integration over all such metrics is possible",
    ".    this problem can be at least partially circumvented by demonstrating the effects of coherence loss in any one set of appropriate metrics , since other metrics within the path integral can not then restore it .",
    "this has been carried out for incident scalar fields by hawking & ross  @xcite , who exploited the separability of the scalar wave equation in the electrovac c metric for this purpose .",
    "the euclidean electrovac c metric possesses a hypersurface orthogonal killing vector , allowing analytic continuation to a well - defined real lorentzian metric in which scattering calculations may be attempted . in a sense the use of the lorentzian metric is nothing more than a mathematical trick to compute scattering effects in the euclidean section .",
    "the lorentzian section of the c metric contains a pair of black holes accelerating apart , pulled by cosmic strings extending to infinity .    hawking & ross argued that , although the quantum bubble metric need not satisfy any field equations , its lorentzian section would have a structure like that of the c metric but without the axial singularities .",
    "they further argued however that the c metric was a sufficiently good model for the bubble metric in the scattering calculation since the singularities would not adversely affect the results .",
    "their calculation seemed to confirm that , at least semi - classically , quantum coherence of the incident scalar field is lost .    in anticipation of extending this latter calculation ,",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present , in a useful form , the classical perturbation equations for incident fields of arbitrary spin ( the teukolsky equations  @xcite ) in the c metric .",
    "after briefly reviewing some properties of the c metric ,  in particular the ` equal temperature condition ' and the ` point - particle ' limit relevant to virtual black hole calculations ,  the full teukolsky equations for arbitrary spin fields are presented .",
    "the separability of these equations into one - dimensional ` radial ' and ` angular ' parts is then guaranteed ( for all fields in the vacuum case and some fields in the electrovac case ) due to the petrov type d classification ( kamran & mclenaghan  @xcite ) , and this separation is subsequently demonstrated .",
    "the resulting equations are then solved in the ` point - particle ' limit to yield an approximate angular solution together with an angular momentum quantisation condition , and an approximate radial solution .",
    "transmission and reflection coefficients are then found for incident fields of a specific initial configuration , following hawking & ross .",
    "the electrovac c metric ( @xcite and further references therein ) is most commonly expressed in the form ds^2 = \\ { -p(y)dt^2 + - - p(x)d^2 } .",
    "[ metric ] in this notation the ` metric polynomial ' @xmath13 is a quartic which may be written as p ( ) = \\ { 1 + } \\ { 1 - ^2 - ^3 } [ metpoly1 ] where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are dimensionless positive constants constrained such that @xmath13 has four real roots .",
