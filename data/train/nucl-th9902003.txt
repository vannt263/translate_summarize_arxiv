    "dirac sea effects are perhaps the most interesting characteristic of relativistic many body theory . in nuclear matter",
    "e.g. the effective mass of the nucleons and their coupling to the mesons undergo considerable corrections due to vacuum fluctuations @xcite,@xcite .",
    "in addition , relativistic many body theory predicts strong corrections of the properties of hadrons at high nuclear matter densities .",
    "unfortunately , up to now it proved to be very difficult to find unambiguous experimental evidence for such effects .",
    "one method to probe the dirac sea is to investigate the production of antiprotons and other antibaryons in heavy ion collisions .",
    "such experiments are currently performed by several groups under quite different kinematic conditions . these range from subthreshold production of antiprotons in ni+ni collisions at 1.85 gev / nucleon at sis ( gsi ) @xcite up to antibaryon production in au+au collisions at 14.6 gev / nucleon at ags ( e878 collaboration at bnl ) @xcite and sulphur  nucleus collisions at 200 gev / nucleon at sps ( na35 collaboration at cern ) @xcite . beside the search for evidence of the quark ",
    "gluon plasma @xcite the attention is drawn to possible changes of the properties of the nucleons and especially the vector mesons @xcite",
    " @xcite in the nuclear medium .",
    "the presence of a filled dirac sea of antiparticles , in addition to the fermi sea of protons and neutrons , has consequences not only for the static properties mentioned above , but also for the dynamics of nuclear matter .",
    "the latter may be probed e.g. by measuring the response of the system to the disturbance induced by an external virtual photon , as it is done in inelastic electron scattering experiments .",
    "a well known and as yet unsolved problem in this field is an apparent quenching ( in comparison with the prediction of simple one  particle models ) of the longitudinal contribution to the inclusive scattering cross section , particularly for medium heavy and heavier nuclei like @xmath1ca , @xmath2fe and @xmath3u .",
    "first observed for momentum transfers of some 100mev / c @xcite , @xcite , a slac experiment @xcite later showed that the quenching even persists up to 1gev / c .",
    "this may be taken as a hint that relativistic effects play a role .",
    "further , it seems reasonable that in heavier nuclei collective phenomena reduce the strength of longitudinal one  particle excitations .",
    "so the quenching problem of the longitudinal response function appears as an appropriate subject for the application of relativistic many body theory .",
    "the first conserving approximation which also includes collective phenomena in a proper way is the random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    " calculations of the response functions for inelastic electron scattering have been done by several authors @xcite  @xcite . in the framework of walecka s",
    "@xmath4model @xcite the first calculations were performed for nuclear matter @xcite  @xcite and then applied to finite nuclei via the local density approximation ( lda ) @xcite , @xcite . as a result of many body correlations , in rpa",
    "the longitudinal response function is reduced by about 1020% compared to the mean field ( mfa ) and hartree approximation ( ha ) .",
    "this reproduces at least qualitatively the trend of the experimental data .",
    "similar results were obtained in a finite nucleus calculation @xcite .    despite the final curves of @xcite  @xcite seem to confirm the same qualitative picture , they are obtained from two completely different approximation schemes . while vacuum polarization was neglected in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "it is included in the other calculations . in view of the results for",
    "the response functions one could argue that these seem _ _ not to be very sensitive with respect to dirac sea effects .",
    "but this is not the case .",
    "the true situation is veiled by the fact that all calculations were performed only for the space  like kinematic region ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the reason therefore is of course that only this regime is accessible by electron scattering .",
    "the aim of the present paper now is to draw attention to the fact , that effects in the space and time  like energy regimes , which seem to be so well separated in view of the completely different experimental methods of investigation sketched above , nevertheless have an influence on each other .",
    "especially it is our goal to show , that calculations which are performed to explain experimental data in one of the two kinematic regions have at least to be checked , whether for the other regime these provide results , which are physically consistent at least within the model used .",
    "so it will be shown that in the @xmath4model only calculations including dirac sea effects will preserve causality .",
    "however , this becomes obvious only if one looks at the time  like part of the electro  nuclear response function . in rpa one would expect to find there a sharp peak corresponding to the @xmath6 and the @xmath7meson respectively , which are the transmitter of the interaction in the walecka model . through their interaction with the nucleons",
    "these acquire the character of ` dressed ' quasi  particles .",
    "this takes place in form of repeated creation and decay of virtual particle  hole and ( if the dirac sea is also taken into account ) particle  antiparticle pairs which leads to a collective excitation of the whole nuclear matter system . because a photon , emitted by an electron in a scattering process , interact with the nucleonic system via the same mechanism , these collective excitations manifest themselves as peaks in the corresponding response functions",
    "more specific , there are four degrees of freedom : one scalar from the @xmath6 and a longitudinal as well as two transverse from the @xmath7 , where the latter are degenerated because of rotational invariance .",
    "accordingly , two peaks are expected in the longitudinal response function ( because of a mixing between the scalar and the longitudinal degree of freedom ) and one in the transverse branch .",
    "these collective excitations in the time  like energy region have a direct back  coupling to the quasielastic bump in the space  like regime : they draw off strength , which causes the rpa  effect observed in former calculations @xcite  @xcite .",
    "in addition , these collective excitations should influence also the nucleonic properties which are studied in the heavy ion collision experiments mentioned at the beginning of this section .",
    "for example the masses of the mesons as well as the nucleons are shifted by the interaction @xcite which has consequences also for the subthreshold antiproton production @xcite .",
    "this shows again how deeply connected phenomena in the two different kinematic regions are .",
    "the mechanism for the reduction of the quasielastic bump , described so far , of course makes sense only if the time  like collective excitations which draw off the strength from the space  like regime are _ physical _ degrees of freedom .    as will be shown , this is only the case if dirac sea effects are properly taken into account .",
    "a calculation where vacuum polarization is neglected shows only one meson peak in the longitudinal and no peak at all in the transverse branch of the electro",
    " nuclear response function .",
    "instead we find two peaks in the _ upper complex energy plane _ which means that these are not corresponding to well defined quasi particles but announce an instability of the nuclear matter system .",
    "therefore vacuum polarization is crucial for the stability of nuclear matter .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to study general properties of collective excitations in the nuclear matter system which are rather a consequence of many body effects then of the basic nn ",
    "potential actually used . because it is not our intent to compare our curves with experimental data we use with the walecka model a simple but nevertheless nontrivial nn  interaction .",
    "this has the advantage that for space and time  like ( real ) energies the calculations may be done analytically which makes it easier to perform the numerical extension to complex energies .    in section ii the criteria for the stability of collective excitations",
    "will be discussed in general . in order to explore the upper complex energy plane with respect to destabilizing unphysical modes we have to perform an analytic continuation of the electro",
    "nuclear response functions .",
    "this will be done in section iii . using dispersion relations we introduce a renormalization concept",
    "@xcite which is new in this context . instead of using dimensional regularization  as it was done in @xcite and @xcite ",
    "we perform subtractions in the dispersion integrals for the polarization tensor in order to get rid of the infinities due to vacuum polarization .",
    "we show explicitly that both renormalization technics lead to the same results for the response functions which is an interesting result in itself .",
    "in section iv the response functions are at first discussed for real energies . in section v we look at the single particle properties in the space  like ( quasielastic bump ) and the time  like regime ( particle  antiparticle excitations ) .",
    "in both cases as a consequence of rpa ",
    "correlations we find a reduction of the response functions compared to the independent particle model .",
    "this effect is most striking for the particle  antiparticle production amplitude which for high energies is reduced exactly by a factor 2 .",
    "we show that this halving of the amplitude is a general result which holds true for _ any _ isospin independent interaction .",
    "this is one of the main results of the present paper .    in section",
    "vi we discuss the role of collective excitations extending our considerations from real energies to the upper complex energy plane .",
    "neglecting vacuum polarization we find the result mentioned already above , that the nuclear matter system becomes unstable because of excitations with complex energy @xmath8 where @xmath9 .",
    "finally our conclusions are given in section vii .",
    "a possible mass change of light vector mesons inside nuclear matter as a consequence of medium modifications of the quark condensate @xmath10 @xcite has recently drawn attention to calculations of timelike collective excitations in various models .",
    "an comprehensive overview of this work can be found in @xcite and the references given therein .",
    "hatsuda et .",
    "estimate the mass reductions of @xmath11 , @xmath7 and @xmath12 using qcd sum rules and compare these results with a calculation in the framework of the @xmath4model ( which is suitable extended in order to include strangeness and the @xmath12meson ) . in the latter approach which is similar to ours in this paper",
    "they obtain the effectives masses from zeroes of the inverse meson propagator in the long wavelength limes @xmath13 inside nuclear matter .",
    "apart from this actual interest in density dependent changes of the quark condensate collective modes in nuclear matter were studied already previously by several groups .",
    "the first calculation within the @xmath4model was performed by chin @xcite . neglecting vacuum polarization he did an additional severe approximation excitations due to the filled fermi sea",
    "is excluded from the calculation . ]",
    "evaluating the momentum integrals in the expression for the dielectric function .",
    "so chin s results are partly in contradiction to the work of lim and horowitz @xcite who calculated the density dependent momentum integrals exactly but neglected vacuum polarization too .",
    "these authors also addressed the problem of the stability of collective modes , however from a different point of view then ours in this paper .",
    "lim and horowitz investigated the density dependence of _ real _ collective zero energy modes ( @xmath14 ) in the space  like region .",
    "if for a given density ( characterized by the fermi momentum @xmath15 ) and momentum @xmath16 such a mode arises , this indicates that in the uniform nuclear matter system an instability occurs which drives a phase transition to a spatial inhomogeneous state .",
    "a similar type of instability was studied by furnstahl and horowitz @xcite in connection with the so called landau ghost which appears in meson propagators when vacuum polarization is included .",
    "neither of these singularities will affect our calculations .",
    "the first type is excluded because we are only interested in nuclear matter at saturation density ( @xmath17 ) where the system is stable against zero energy modes ( see fig.12 of @xcite ) .",
    "the landau ghost appears only for momentum transfers of @xmath18 ( @xmath19 nucleon mass ) @xcite which is much higher then the momenta we are considering . in the following we examine the nuclear matter system with respect to a different kind of instabilities . in the previous calculations of collective nuclear matter excitations",
    "mentioned above , only the denominator of the meson propagator was analyzed on the real energy axes .",
    "zeroes of this denominator are good candidates for corresponding poles in the propagator i.e. an excitation of the system .",
    "but , while even a zero of real _ and _ imaginary parts of the denominator is not always a sufficient condition for a pole ( if the nominator also becomes small ) , often only the vanishing of the real part for an given energy @xmath20 is already taken for an excitation . if the imaginary part of the denominator keeps sufficient small ( and if the nominator is finite ) this is correct and the propagator in the neighbourhood of @xmath20 has the shape of a lorentz curve corresponding to an excitation with a decay width depending on the magnitude of the imaginary part .    in a paper by jean et .",
    "@xcite the denominator of the @xmath7-meson propagators has been analyzed similar to @xcite and @xcite in order to find a mass shift as result of medium modifications in the @xmath4model .",
    "as it is one of the aims of the present paper , jean et .",
    "al . also studied the influence of the dirac sea on the effective @xmath7 mass comparing the full calculation with one where vacuum polarization is neglected and only pauli blocking is taken into account . while in the presence of vacuum polarization all degrees of freedom are correctly reflected by a corresponding pole in the propagator they found in the latter case zeroes of the real part of the denominator simultaneously with a nonvanishing _ negative _ imaginary contribution .",
    "they concluded that `` this nonzero imaginary part contributes to an unphysical ( i.e. negative ) decay width for the @xmath7 meson '' .",
    "as mentioned above , at this point it becomes obvious that it is not sufficient to look only at the denominator of the propagator . in section",
    "vi we will show that the zero of the real part of the latter , found by jean et .",
    "al . , does not correspond to a collective excitation with `` negative decay width '' ( whatever this means ) at least not on the real energy axes .",
    "however , in order to find out what is really hidden behind this unphysical mode , it is necessary to explore the full propagator ( not only it s denominator ) in the whole complex energy plane .",
    "as noticed already in the introduction , the neglect of vacuum polarization entails an instability of the nuclear matter system indicated by poles of the electro ",
    "nuclear response functions in the upper complex energy plane .    in the case of inclusive ( e , e)scattering there are two independent response functions , a longitudinal and a transverse , which can be expressed by the corresponding matrix elements of the polarization tensor @xmath21 .",
    "if we choose a co  ordinate system were @xmath22 is parallel to the @xmath23axes , @xmath21 can be written in the form : @xmath24 the fourier transform of @xmath21 : @xmath25 is defined as the change @xmath26 of the nuclear current in @xmath23 due to a change @xmath27 of the vector potential in @xmath28 , induced by the scattered electron : @xmath29 according to linear response theory @xcite @xmath30 can be expressed by the ground state expectation value of the commutator @xmath31 $ ] .",

    "now , for @xmath35 the @xmath36integral in ( [ 1 ] ) has to be closed in the upper complex energy plane .",
    "then a zero contribution can only be obtained if @xmath37 is analytic there .",
    "on the contrary , if @xmath37 has poles in the upper half plane , this means that there is a response of the system preceding an external disturbance which is equivalent to an instability . because in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite only poles on the real @xmath36axis were examined , non causal singularities could not be found by these authors .",

    "the sum of vacuum and density dependent contributions ( figs.3a and 4a ) however is always positive . which is about @xmath133 below the threshold for pair production .",
    "but one has to keep in mind , that these curves show the result of two different approximations .",
    "as was pointed out in section iv the effective nucleon mass is higher when vacuum polarization is taken into account properly . consequently the @xmath123-threshold @xmath134 is shifted according to the corresponding mass shift from @xmath105 to @xmath106",
    "so in figs.3a and 4a the density dependent contributions start at the same threshold as vacuum polarization ] as noticed already in sec.iii , with regard to vacuum polarization @xmath49 does not fall off to zero for @xmath83 but approaches a constant value ( see equ .",
    "( [ 17 ] ) ) . as a consequence of our remarks above this holds true also for the longitudinal response function ( see fig.3a ) .",
    "therefore the real part of @xmath135 in fig.3b can not be obtained directly from the curve in fig.3a making use of ( [ 16 ] ) as it was the case in fig 1 . instead , according to the first equation of ( [ 18 ] ) one subtraction",
    "has to be performed .",
    "the meaning of this renormalization procedure becomes more obvious , if one splits up the vacuum contribution in fig.3a in a constant part ( which starts at the @xmath123threshold ) and a contribution which has an asymptotic behaviour like @xmath136 for @xmath83 ( compare equ .",
    "( [ 12 ] ) ) .",
    "more specifically we write @xmath137 in the form : @xmath138 where by construction @xmath139 provides a finite contribution to the integral ( [ 16 ] ) which is harmless .",
    "the leading order high energy contribution to @xmath112 comes from the @xmath140function which may be integrated performing one subtraction : @xmath141 the negative sign of the principal value integral in ( [ 23b ] ) follows from the definition ( [ 22 ] ) of the response function : @xmath142 . in this way",
    "we obtain the same result as by using dimensional regularization @xcite , @xcite .",
    "because of ( [ 23 ] ) two subtractions are needed in order to calculate @xmath143 from the response function in fig.4a ( i.e. one has to integrate @xmath144 and multiply the result with @xmath145 ) . analogous to ( [ 23b ] ) one obtains to leading order in @xmath81 : @xmath146 this result can be easily checked in fig.4b . hence the relation ( [ 23 ] ) is valid also for the real parts of @xmath120 , i.e. in the high energy limit we get the final relation : @xmath147 which will be used in the following.\\pi_{vac}(q^2)$ ] .",
    "so equ . ( [ 23d ] ) proves that our renormalization procedure preserves current conservation . ]",
    "rpa - correlations lead to a dramatical decrease of @xmath123 pair production by a factor @xmath148 . in our approximation of point",
    " like nucleons without anomalous magnetic moment this suppression is a consequence of isospin symmetry . for the transverse response function",
    "this can be read off most easily from equ .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) . because the photon in our approximation couples only to protons while meson exchange is charge - independent , the ` electromagnetic bubbles ' @xmath50 for single particle - hole pair creation as well as in the numerator of the rpa - correction are weighted by a factor @xmath148 in contrast to the ` mesonic ' bubble in the denominator . for high energies",
    "the @xmath130-dependent part of this denominator becomes much larger than 1 .",
    "this can be checked substituting @xmath50 according to ( [ 23d ] ) : the leading factor @xmath130 cancels the @xmath149-decrease of the propagator @xmath150 , so that the rpa - denominator in ( [ 4 ] ) goes like @xmath151 ( see equ .",
    "( [ 23b ] ) ) .",
    "hence for high energies the 1 in the rpa - denominator may be neglected .",
    "then the rest of the denominator in ( [ 4 ] ) cancels against the corresponding part in the nominator so that ( because of the isospin - factor 1/2 ) one gets from the rpa - correction a contribution which is exactly ( -1/2 ) times the single @xmath123-bubble contribution . which is a parameter of the model . if @xmath152 ( compare equ .",
    "( [ 21 ] ) ) the reduction by a factor 1/2 starts practically already at threshold which is confirmed by figs.3 and 4 . ]",
    "the same holds true for the longitudinal part ( [ 3 ] ) of the polarization propagator . as pointed out in the section preceding equ .",
    "( [ 13 ] ) , @xmath74 is a purely density dependent contribution . from equ .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) it follows ( and can be easily checked in figs.1 and 2 ) that @xmath153 for @xmath154 .",
    "consequently only the third term in the nominator and the first term in the denominator of ( [ 3 ] ) are nonzero for @xmath36 high enough .",
    "so in this limes @xmath155 can be written : @xmath156_{\\mathrm l}(q_{0},\\vec q^{\\,2}))\\ ; = \\ ; \\frac{e^{2}}{2}\\pi_{vv}^{\\mathrm l}(q_{0},\\vec q^{\\,2 } )   \\,+\\ , e^{2}\\ , \\frac{\\frac{q^{2}}{\\vec q^{\\,2}}g_{v } ( \\frac{1}{2}\\pi_{vv}^{\\mathrm l})^{2 } } { ( 1-\\frac{q^{2}}{\\vec q^{\\,2}}g_{v}\\pi_{vv}^{\\mathrm l } ) } \\;.\\ ] ] completely analogous to the rpa - correction to @xmath157 , the 1 in the denominator of ( [ 23e ] ) may be neglected and one gets a negative contribution of just one half of the single pair production amplitude .",
    "this argumentation on the one hand is very general because it is based only on the isospin symmetry of the nn - interaction and holds true beyond the @xmath4model .",
    "so for point  like nucleons we would expect a suppression of the cross section @xmath158 by 50% , inside nuclear matter as well as in the vacuum . on the other hand",
    "we know that nucleons are _ not point  like _ particles , which may invalidate ( at least partly ) our reasoning .",
    "nevertheless , we think that our model calculation has shown that many body correlations can produce effects far beyond the usually assumed level of 10 - 20% .",
    "this result should not alter dramatically taking the finite size of nucleons properly into account .",
    "an observable which would be directly affected by such many body effects is the ratio : @xmath159 within the simple quark  parton model ( qpm )  which corresponds to the one bubble approximation in our calculations ",
    "r is given by : @xmath160 where the index @xmath161 runs over all quark flavours with charge @xmath162 .",
    "a review on the value of r measured in several experiments can be found in @xcite .",
    "unfortunately our considerations concerning the process @xmath163 cover only a fraction of r which makes it difficult to compare directly with these experiments .",
    "nevertheless , a thorough analysis of the above general isospin argument on the quark level seems to be worthwhile but goes beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "another remarkable difference between the full and dashed curves in figs.1 - 4 are the narrow peaks in the time  like energy regime below the threshold for pair production .",
    "these belong to the collective excitations already discussed in sections i and ii .",
    "the correct structure of these poles in the real _ and _ imaginary part of the polarization propagator may be obtained only if the calculation is extended to complex energies .",
    "the sharp @xmath68peaks in the response functions ( see part a of figs",
    ". 1 - 4 ) are the result of an analytic continuation back to the real energy axis according to ( [ 22 ] ) . for @xmath164",
    "the one bubble contribution to the response function is zero in the unphysical region @xmath165 . as a consequence , also the nominator of the rpa  corrections in equs .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) and ( [ 4 ] ) vanishes for these energies .",
    "hence zeros of the denominator , which are the signal of collective excitations , lead to an indefinite expression for the rpa  formulas .",
    "former calculations of the electronuclear response functions @xcite@xcite were restricted only to real spacelike energies ( more specific : to the quasi elastic bump ) and therefore did not have to care about this problem . on the other hand , the authors who looked for timelike excitations @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite only calculated the denominators of equs .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) and ( [ 4 ] ) and looked for zeroes in this quantity .",
    "as will be shown below , for real excitations this method provides the correct spectrum , but in the case of an instability such a treatment may be misleading .    from counting of degrees of freedom ( see section i ) one would expect two peaks in the longitudinal and one ( twofold degenerate ) peak in the transverse response function .",
    "but figs.1 and 2 , where only density dependent contributions are taken into account , show one single excitation in the longitudinal and none at all in the transverse branch .",
    "however , including vacuum polarization the curves in figs.3 and 4 show the correct number of peaks .    here",
    "it is instructive to look at the rpa - denominators in both approximations which are shown in fig.5 for the longitudinal branch ( the following arguments hold true also for the transverse response ) .",
    "the large peaks in the real parts of both figures come from the free @xmath6 and @xmath7 propagator in the denominator of equ .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) with masses given in equ . (",
    "the dispersion of the dressed mesons inside nuclear matter is determined by the zeroes of the full curves in fig.5 ( but , as said before , only if the imaginary part , i.e. the dashed curve in fig.5 , vanishes too ) .",
    "including vacuum polarization ( fig.5b ) we find a reduction of the effective meson masses because the zeroes are situated below the peaks of the free propagators .",
    "this result is in accordance with previous calculations @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . on the contrary , neglecting dirac sea effects , the real zeroes of the rpa  denominator ( from which only the first corresponds to a well defined excitation ) are situated above the free meson poles which means an enhanced mass of the quasiparticles .    in order to understand the reason for this difference in the two approximations it is helpful to take a closer look at the shape of the peaks in fig.5 .",
    "if one compares fig.5a with fig.5b it is easy to verify a different sign of the meson poles .",
    "while in fig.5a the real part of the denominator is positive below the poles and negative above , the zeroes corresponding to the quasiparticles also lie above the poles .",
    "exactly opposite is the situation for the calculation including vacuum polarization ( fig.5b ) which leads to the reduction of the meson mass .",
    "now , the mechanism _ how _ dirac sea effects cause this negative mass shift becomes clearer , if one looks at the denominator of the rpa correction in equ .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) . in the energy range between the photon point @xmath166 and the threshold for pair production @xmath167 the mixing term of scalar and vector degrees of freedom @xmath168 can be neglected in comparison with the pure terms @xmath49 and @xmath84 .",
    "so for these energies the rpa denominator may be approximated by the expression @xmath169 .",
    "the poles of the propagators @xmath170 and @xmath171 provide the peaks discussed above , the signs of which depend on the sign of @xmath49 and @xmath84 in the neighbourhood of these poles respectively . because without rpa corrections @xmath49 is directly proportional to the longitudinal response function ( see the first term in equ .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) ) its behaviour can be red off from the dashed curves in figs.1 and 3 . for the energies under consideration the imaginary parts vanish .",
    "neglecting the dirac sea , the dashed curve in fig.1b for @xmath172 has positive sign . because the scalar and vector meson masses are well separated , near the vector pole @xmath173 .",
    "this leads to the peak structure described above and an enhancement of the @xmath7 mass inside nuclear matter in this approximation .    comparing fig.1b with fig.3b it is easy to see",
    ", that vacuum polarization provides a _ negative _ contribution to the real part of @xmath49 .",
    "the result of this is the switch of sign in the free @xmath7 pole observed in fig.5b with the consequence of a reduced mass of the dressed quasiparticle . according to equ .",
    "( [ 18 ] ) the magnitude of the negative dirac sea contribution and thus also the meson mass shift depends on the amplitude for nucleon ",
    "antinucleon pair production .",
    "the threshold for this process inside nuclear matter is determined by the effective nucleon mass @xmath67 which is the free nucleon mass @xmath174 reduced by a term proportional to the scalar density @xmath175 @xcite . hence analogous to the results of the qcd inspired approach @xcite , @xcite with a meson mass shift due to medium modifications of the quark condensate @xmath176 also in the walecaka model a scalar density",
    "is responsible for the changes in the dispersion of the mesonic degrees of freedom .    despite the preceding considerations , as an illustration of our method ,",
    "gave us a qualitative picture of the underlying mechanism for the meson mass shift , it is not the purpose of the present paper to analyze this effect in more detail .",
    "rather it is our goal to point out the importance of vacuum polarization for the stability of the nuclear matter system . in @xcite jean et .",
    "al . argue that , neglecting vacuum polarization , the zero in the real part of fig.5a at @xmath177 belongs to a collective excitation with `` an unphysical ( i.e. negative ) decay width '' because of the nonzero negative imaginary part of the rpa - denominator in this energy range .",
    "however , according to figs.1 and 2 for _ real _ energies the response functions itself do not show any sign of such a unphysical mode .",
    "the cusp like structures at @xmath178 in the real parts of the longitudinal and transverse matrix elements of the polarization tensor ( figs.1b and 2b ) are already present in the one bubble approximation and therefore are not the result of collective phenomena .",
    "the true situation unfolds itself only if the calculation of the response functions is extended to complex energies ( see figs.6 and 7 ) .",
    "the peaks which are missed on the real energy axes reappear as _ undamped _ poles in the upper complex half plane .",
    "so in contrast to the prediction of @xcite an approximation which neglects vacuum polarization does not lead to a negative decay width of the @xmath7 meson but to collective excitations which are unphysical because , according to the discussion in section ii , they manifestly destroy causality .",
    "consequently calculation within this approximation can not provide reliable results .",
    "we studied qualitative properties of the electro ",
    "nuclear response functions for nuclear matter with respect to single particle and collective excitations . performing the calculations exemplary in walecka s @xmath4model",
    ", the main results were obtained from general arguments which should hold true far beyond this simple model for the medium nn  interaction .",
    "in contrast to former calculations where the main attention was concentrated on the quasielastic region , we extended our considerations 1 ) to the time  like energy regime and 2 ) to complex energies .",
    "the latter was achieved making use of dispersion relations . as an alternative to dimensional",
    "regularization we introduced a renormalization scheme which is more appropriate to our approach : infinite vacuum contributions were removed performing suitable subtractions in the dispersion integrals . with the appropriate boundary conditions this method leads to the same results as dimensional regularization .    neglecting vacuum polarization we found that there is a violation of causality because of unstable longitudinal and transverse collective excitations in the upper complex energy plane . including vacuum polarization ,",
    "these collective modes are shifted to the real axes and change to proper excitations of the system .",
    "so we have shown that vacuum polarization is crucial for the stability of nuclear matter .",
    "in addition we have shown that rpa - corrections reduce the production amplitude of @xmath179 pairs by a factor 1/2 .",
    "this result is remarkable because it holds true for any interaction between point  like nucleons which preserves isospin symmetry .",
    "our argument may have interesting consequences for the process @xmath180 .",
