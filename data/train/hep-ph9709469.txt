    "[ fig:2 ]    up to order @xmath0 the heavy quark coefficient functions are given by the following parton subprocesses . in order @xmath50 we have the virtual photon gluon fusion mechanism given by @xmath51 from which one obtains the heavy quark coefficient function @xmath52 . here",
    "the superscript denotes the order in the perturbation series . in next - to- leading order ( nlo )",
    "one has the following processes .",
    "first one has to include the virtual gluon corrections to reaction ( [ eqn:9 ] ) which have to be added to the gluon bremsstrahlung process @xmath53 this leads to the coefficient function @xmath54 .",
    "finally we also have the subprocess @xmath55 the above reaction has two different production mechanisms .",
    "the first one is the bethe - heitler process where the virtual photon is coupled to the heavy quark which leads to the coefficient function @xmath56 . here",
    "ps means purely singlet since this function originates from the partonic process where a gluon ( flavour singlet ) is exchanged in the @xmath57-channel between the light quark @xmath58 and the heavy quark @xmath2 .",
    "the second one is the compton process where the virtual photon is coupled to the light quark from which one obtains @xmath59 .",

    "the exact heavy quark coefficient functions @xmath56 and @xmath54 have been only calculated in the unpolarised case ( @xmath60 ) ( see @xcite ) but the exact expressions in polarised scattering ( @xmath61 ) are not known yet .",
    "however in @xcite and @xcite we could derive analytic formulae for the asymptotic heavy quark coefficient functions up to order @xmath0 for unpolarised and polarised electroproduction respectively .",
    "the asymptotic heavy quark coefficient functions are defined by @xmath63 \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these asymptotic expressions are very useful because    * they provide us with a check on the exact calculation . *",
    "the exact calculation of @xmath56 and @xmath54 ( @xmath21 ) is semi - analytic and they are only available in the form of long computer programs ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the latter show numerical instabilties at @xmath4 which are remedied by using in this region @xmath64 . * further if these asymptotic heavy quark coefficient functions are substituted in eq .",
    "( [ eqn:5 ] ) it turns out that ( see @xcite , @xcite ) @xmath65 tends to unity as @xmath66 and @xmath67 . in the case of charm production ( @xmath68 and @xmath69",
    "this happens for @xmath70 .",
    "this implies that above a rather low value of @xmath7 it does not make any difference whether we use the asymptotic or the exact expressions for @xmath46 .",
    "* the asymptotic forms of the heavy quark coefficient functions also play a major role in the derivation of the variable number flavour scheme ( vfns ) from the fixed flavour number sheme ( ffns ) ( see @xcite , @xcite )    the asymptotic heavy quark coefficient functions get the typical form @xmath71 with an analogous expression for @xmath72 .",
    "there are two ways to determine eq .",
    "( [ eqn:14 ] ) .    *",
    "evaluate the phase space integrals and the feynman integrals in the usual way for @xmath4 .",
    "* use operator product expansion techniques and the theorem of mass factorization .",
    "the last method was applied in @xcite and @xcite to compute the asymptotic forms of the heavy quark coefficient functions for unpolarised and polarised scattering respectively .",
    "in this section we will analyse the charm component of the longitudinal spin structure function @xmath73 . to compute the latter in nlo the following coefficient functions are available : @xmath74 ( born ) , @xmath75 ( compton process ) , @xmath76 ( gluon bremsstrahlung ) , @xmath77 ( bethe - heitler ) .",
    "like in unpolarised scattering the gluonic coefficient functions indicated by @xmath78 are the most important ones .",
    "therefore deep inelastic electroproduction of charm quarks provide us with an excellent way to determine the gluon density in polarised scattering ( see eq .",
    "( [ eqn:5 ] ) ) .",
    "however as we will show below the charm component in the spin case is much smaller with respect to the light parton contribution to the structure function as observed for @xmath79 in unpolarised scattering .",
    "this is revealed by @xmath76 in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] where we observe a strongly oscillatory behaviour which is in contrast to its unpolarised analogue shown in fig . 8 of @xcite .",
    "further it satisfies the sum rule @xmath80 which holds in any scheme .",
    "notice that the born contribution @xmath81 also satisfies the above relation and we may safely assume that eq .",
    "( [ eqn:15 ] ) holds in all orders for general @xmath7 and @xmath82 .",
    "further it turns out that the coefficient functions @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) are much smaller than their unpolarised analogues .",
    "in particular the large logarithmic terms of the type @xmath85 which are characteristic of the latter do not show up in the spin case .",
    "the absence of these corrections and the oscillatory behaviour leads to much smaller charm quark contributions to @xmath73 than observed for @xmath79 or @xmath86 . to give a better estimate of the order @xmath0 corrections we have to improve the asymptotic form of the coefficient functions @xmath76 and @xmath77 a little bit . in @xcite",
    "we multiplied them by @xmath87 and added to @xmath76 the soft gluon bremsstrahlung term which is universal ( see eqs .",
    "( 5.1)-(5.3 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "these approximations were tested for @xmath88 and @xmath89 and we found a fairly good agreement with the exact results as long as @xmath90 and @xmath91 .    .",
    "[ fig:3 ]    choosing the parton density set in @xcite ( standard scenario ) with @xmath92 and @xmath93 we have plotted the charm component of @xmath94 and @xmath95 at @xmath96 in fig .",
    "3 . from this figure",
    "we infer that the charm component becomes maximal in the region @xmath97 .",
    "further we observe that in nlo the result becomes twice as large than in lo .",
    "we also made a comparison in fig .",
    "4 with the quantity @xmath98 which is due to light partons ( @xmath99 and @xmath100 ) only . here",
    "we see that the charm component amounts to about @xmath101 of @xmath98 .",
    "this is in contrast to the observation made for the structure function @xmath79 in unpolarised scattering ( see @xcite , @xcite ) . in the latter case",
    "the charm component becomes large at very small @xmath11 ( i.e. @xmath102 ) and it amounts to about @xmath103 with respect to the total structure function . in @xcite",
    "we also studied the spin structure functions plotted at @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "these plots show the same features as the ones made for @xmath96 so that our conclusions are unaltered .    .",
    "since we know the exact result for @xmath106 @xcite we can compute the order @xmath0 correction to the bjrken sum rule due to heavy flavour contributions .",
    "the latter is given by @xmath107= \\frac{1}{6 } \\mid \\frac{g_a}{g_v } \\mid \\big ( l_{1,q}^{\\rm ns } \\big ) ^{(1)}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the superscript @xmath108 denotes the first moment ( mellin transform ) . in order",
    "@xmath0 we have the following properties @xmath109 which shows the decoupling of the heavy quark when @xmath110 . @xmath111\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the light parton contribution to the bjrken sum rule is given by @xmath112= \\frac{1}{6 } \\mid \\frac{g_a}{g_v } \\mid \\big ( { \\cal c}_{1,q}^{\\rm ns } \\big ) ^{(1)}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath113 denotes the massless quark coefficient function .",
    "the first moment of the latter quantity has been calculated up to order @xmath114 in @xcite and the order @xmath115 term has been estimated too ( see e.g. @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the charm contribution to the bjrken sum rule is even smaller than the the estimated order @xmath115 correction ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the contributions coming from the bottom and top quark are even smaller which can be attributed to the decoupling of heavy quarks shown in eq .",
    "[ eqn:17 ] .",
    "finally we have the relation @xmath116 so that for @xmath4 the large logarithm @xmath117 in the heavy quark coefficient function @xmath118 ( eq . ( [ eqn:19 ] ) ) can be absorbed in the light quark coefficient function @xmath113 .",
    "hence the number of light flavours in the running coupling constant and in @xmath113 on the righthand side of eq .",
