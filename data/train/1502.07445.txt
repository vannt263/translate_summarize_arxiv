    "glasses have become increasingly useful and popular in materials engineering and industry .",
    "nevertheless , its microscopic structure is not as clearly understood as crystalline solids .",
    "this is mainly due to the lack of long - range order ( lro ) .",
    "hence the local structures , instead of lro , have been extensively studied to characterize amorphous structures . in particular , short - range order ( sro ) , which describes atomic configurations of nearest neighbors , was well understood both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "however , it becomes clear that the larger - scale structures beyond neighbor atoms so - called medium - range order ( mro ) are much more important than sro in glasses .",
    "the amorphous structures are essentially characterized by possible connection of sro that can build up continuous atomic configurations throughout the materials without any periodicity @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic structural features of mro can be detected in several ways .",
    "for example , the split of the second peak in the radial distribution function is a sign for amorphous metals , whereas the first sharp diffraction peak of the structure factor is a sign for covalent amorphous solids @xcite .",
    "although these signs are evidence for the existence of mro , their geometric origins are not clearly understood like the  periodicity \" of lro or the  chemical or packing order \" of sro .",
    "this is because mro is definitely generated by many - body configurations , and the 2-body distributions such as the radial distribution or the structure factor does not properly describe its geometry .    to describe the many - body atomic structure appearing in amorphous solids , angle distributions and statistics of topological quantities",
    "have been widely used so far .",
    "the bond - angle and torsion - angle distributions extract the partial information of 3-body and 4-body configurations , respectively @xcite .",
    "even though these variables describe the configurations beyond the nearest neighbor , the scope of the scale is restricted within @xmath0-body configurations .    on the other hand , the topological quantification of amorphous structures such as the ring statistics and the voronoi polyhedral analyses",
    "have been used to characterize atomic configurations of covalent and metallic amorphous solids , respectively .",
    "these methods do not restrict the number of atoms to be considered , and are useful to classify the variety of many - body atomic structure in certain situations .",
    "however , they require building some geometric models from atomic configurations based on artificial criteria such as a threshold of the bond length . furthermore , they do not explicitly extract the length scale .",
    "hence they are not suitable for studying multi - scale phenomena , which are supposed to be important to determine mro .",
    "systematic methodologies to study many - body atomic structure with metric information are highly desired .    in recent years ,",
    "persistent homology and its graphical representation , called the persistence diagram ( pd ) , have been invented in the applied mathematics community as a systematic method to extract geometric properties embedded in point cloud data @xcite . by regarding the atomic configuration as a point cloud data",
    ", we can apply the method for geometric analysis of materials .",
    "significantly , this method can deal with many - body configurations , and also can provide two length - scales , _ birth _ and _ death scales _",
    ", which characterize the size of the @xmath1-dimensional holes .",
    "namely , topological properties with metric information can be derived .",
    "furthermore , pds can be computed quite efficiently @xcite so that it can handle complex configurations with a huge amount of atoms obtained by molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations .",
    "based on these observations , the pd approach is expected to be an adequate tool to characterize mro in a systematic way .    in this paper , we propose a methodology based on pds to characterize mro in amorphous solids .",
    "we first provide a brief introduction of pds mainly for readers not familiar with them .",
    "then we show two examples to illustrate the geometric meaning of pds by using fcc crystal and a uniform random configuration .",
    "then , we calculated pds for the atomic configurations of amorphous silica obtained by md simulations .",
    "our method can be applied to a wide class of amorphous solids and complex liquids with atomic configuration data . here , we chose amorphous silica , since it is one of the standard amorphous solids , and hence , is an appropriate model material for comparing our method to the other conventional tools such as ring statistics .",
    "moreover , the extensivity of the betti numbers , the structural hierarchy of the geometric objects appearing in pds , and the decomposition method into single atomic components are also explained . from these arguments , we elucidate the geometry of mro in amorphous silica . as a consequence ,",
    "we conclude that the pd analysis is an appropriate method to describe mro , complementary to the existing tools .",
    "the input for computing persistence diagrams is a pair @xmath2 of an atomic configuration @xmath3 and radius parameters @xmath4 for an @xmath5-atom system . here ,",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath7 are the three - dimensional position and the input radius of the @xmath8-th atom , respectively . instead of setting a threshold by an artificial criterion and giving bonds between atoms ,",
    "we introduce a ball @xmath9 at @xmath10 with radius @xmath11 for each @xmath8-th atom parameterized by @xmath12 .",
    "then , we study persistent topological features in the union of balls @xmath13 by changing the variable @xmath12 .",
    "typically , for a increasing family of @xmath12 , this is a set of inflating atomic balls with centered at @xmath10 .    for each @xmath12 , @xmath1-dimensional holes in @xmath14 such as clusters , rings , and cavities for @xmath15 , and @xmath16 ,",
    "respectively , can be identified by homology @xcite .",
    "then , for each @xmath1-dimensional hole @xmath17 , we can uniquely assign values @xmath18 and @xmath19 at which @xmath17 first appears and disappears , respectively .",
    "these values @xmath20 and @xmath21 are called the birth and death scales of the hole @xmath17 .",
    "the collection @xmath22 of all these birth and death scales @xmath23 is called the @xmath1-dimensional persistence diagram of @xmath24 . here",
    ", we remark that the minimum value @xmath25 of @xmath12 can be negative , i.e. , @xmath26 , and the dimension of @xmath12 ( therefore @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) is length squared .",
    "the pd is a two - dimensional scatter plot .",
    "it follows from @xmath29 that the points in the pd appear above the diagonal . from the construction , the birth and death points",
    "@xmath23 are determined by the @xmath30-body atomic configuration @xmath31 comprising of the @xmath32-th hole @xmath33 .",
    "namely , the birth and death scales are represented by @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "different from the existing many - body variables such as bond angle @xmath36 represented by @xmath37 , or torsion angle @xmath38 represented by @xmath39 , the number @xmath30 of atoms to be considered is not restricted for the birth and death scales .",
    "therefore @xmath27 and @xmath28 are reduced variables of metric properties of @xmath17 .",
    "we use these variables to describe mro .",
    "intuitively , the birth scale @xmath20 indicates the maximum neighboring distance in @xmath40 , because @xmath33 appears when the largest bond ( @xmath41 ) or cap ( @xmath42 ) in @xmath17 is created . on the other hand ,",
    "the death scale @xmath21 indicates the size of @xmath17 , because @xmath33 disappears when it is covered up in the inflated atomic ball model @xmath43 .",
    "we also introduce the life scale @xmath44 that represents the robustness of the hole @xmath33 under the change of the variable @xmath12 .",
    "then , the points far from the diagonal in the pd have long life scales , meaning that they persist in a wide range of @xmath12 . in contrast",
    ", the points close to the diagonal , i.e. , small life scales , correspond to holes that are sensitive to @xmath12 and can be considered noise .    in terms of the characterization of mro , the life and death scales are important .",
    "the former distinguishes the proper geometric objects from the topological noise , whereas the latter represents the sizes of holes .",
    "persistent diagrams can be computed efficiently using freely available open - source software @xcite . for the geometric model of the union of balls structure ,",
    "we use the alpha shapes module in cgal @xcite .",
    "we remark that even though the molecular simulations for bulk systems use periodic boundary conditions , we work with the point cloud data as a set of points in @xmath45 as input to the pds .",
    "hence , some differences will appear when we count the holes across the boundary , although these effects are negligible in a sufficiently large system .",
    "before analyzing the covalent glass structure , we introduce two typical examples . for simplicity ,",
    "we only consider monatomic systems . for a monatomic system ,",
    "the input to the pds is given by the configuration of its atoms and a uniform input radius @xmath46 for all the atoms . by the construction of @xmath47 , pds calculated with a given radius @xmath46",
    "are the same as ones with @xmath48 after the transformation @xmath49 .",
    "hence , we choose the input radius to be zero , and hence the radius with the scale @xmath12 is given by @xmath50 .",
    "the first example is a periodic configuration as a model of perfect crystal . in particular , we choose the fcc crystal . in the unit cell , there are 4 atomic sites at @xmath51 and @xmath52 and the three primitive lattice vectors are set to be @xmath53 and @xmath54",
    ". therefore the number density is @xmath55 .",
    "these lengths are chosen to make the distance between nearest neighbors unity .",
    "we prepare a cubic cluster of the fcc crystal in such a way that the number of unit cells along each edge is @xmath56 , the length of each side is @xmath57 , and hence , the number of atoms is @xmath58 .",
    "the top panels in fig .",
    "[ pds ] show the pds for the fcc .",
    "because of the periodicity , only a few points , each with high multiplicity , are found in each pd .",
    "the point at @xmath59 in @xmath60 represents the length to contact the nearest neighbor .",
    "this is because each inflated atomic ball contacts its nearest neighbor atoms at @xmath61 , i.e , @xmath62 . in the same way",
    ", the point at @xmath63 in @xmath64 represents equilateral triangle rings , and the points @xmath65 and @xmath66 in @xmath67 represent regular tetrahedral and octahedral cavities , respectively . here",
    ", the open circles at the points close to @xmath68 in @xmath64 and @xmath67 represent rings that are regular squares or isosceles right triangles and cavities of isosceles right triangular pyramids , respectively .",
    "these holes are parts of a perfect octahedron .",
    "as the radius of atomic ball becomes large , these holes are instantly covered right after they appeared .     and",

    "the bottom panels correspond to a uniform random configuration composed of @xmath70 particles scattered in the cubic box @xmath71 ^ 3 $ ] .",
    "each point in the pds for the perfect fcc crystal has high multiplicity , whereas pds for the uniform random configuration have broad distributions . ]",
    "the periodicity also leads to high multiplicity . by a simple geometric consideration ,",
    "the multiplicities at @xmath59 in @xmath60 , @xmath63 in @xmath64 , and @xmath65 and @xmath66 in @xmath67 are calculated as @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 respectively .",
    "the coefficients of @xmath76 represent how many clusters , rings , and cavities exist in the unit cell in the bulk system .",
    "specifically , in the unit cell , there are @xmath77 particles , @xmath78 tetrahedra and @xmath77 octahedra .",
    "every ring in the unit cell is a regular triangle , and is shared by a tetrahedron and an octahedron .",
    "therefore we only need to count the number of rings in the octahedra .",
    "each octahedron has @xmath78 triangles on the surface , and thus there are @xmath79 triangle rings in the unit cell .",
    "however , in each octahedron , one ring can be expressed as a linear combination @xcite of the other @xmath80 .",
    "similarly , in each tetrahedron , one ring can be expressed as a linear combination of the other @xmath81 .",
    "thus , we subtract @xmath82 from @xmath79 , to get a total of @xmath83 linearly independent rings in each unit cell .",
    "terms proportional to @xmath84 and the constant come from the boundary effect .",
    "therefore as the number of atoms becomes large , the multiplicities per @xmath5 converge as is seen in fig .",

    "these values converge to their bulk values like @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is a third - order polynomial . ]    in the case of the perfect fcc crystal , the points on the diagonal are due to numerical artifacts , and therefore their multiplicities do not scale as @xmath76 . if a small perturbation such as thermal fluctuation is added to the crystal and resolves the degeneracy , the points with high multiplicities in the pds will split and distribute with finite width .",
    "then , the distorted octahedral cavities generate the secondary rings and cavities close to the diagonal and yield the high multiplicities scaled to @xmath76 , as will be shown later ( see fig .",

    "however , two regions @xmath172 and @xmath173 overlap for the different choice of @xmath181 after the transformation @xmath182 ( the bottom left panel in fig .",

    "[ single : pd ] . ) , @xmath183 represents the transformation induced by the input radius @xmath184 .",
    "hence , the overlap on the transformed coordinates means that the birth and death scales for the rings on @xmath172 and @xmath173 are determined by oxygen .",
    "similarly , we found that @xmath174 is invariant to the input radii after the transformation @xmath185 ( the center panels in fig .  [ changing : radius : method ] . ) .",
    "this means the birth scale is determined by the length between silicon and oxygen , and death scale is determined by the length between oxygen atoms . for @xmath186",
    ", we found the invariance via @xmath187 ( the bottom right panel in fig .",
    "[ changing : radius : method ] ) , meaning that the both scales are controlled by the silicon and oxygen atoms .    using this procedure",
    ", we can classify the regions with respect to the atoms determining the birth and death scales .",
    "furthermore , we can also investigate the compositions of the rings by finding optimal rings @xcite .",
    "for example , it can be shown that the rings on @xmath172 and @xmath173 consist of only oxygen atoms .    , @xmath188 , and @xmath189",
    "are described in the top left panel . for fixed @xmath190 , @xmath191 and @xmath192 are described in the top right panel .",
    "the overlap of @xmath174 is observed under the transformation @xmath193 in the middle panels .",
    "the collapse of @xmath172 and @xmath173 region is observed under the transformation @xmath182 in the bottom left panel .",
    "the collapse of @xmath186 is observed under the transformation @xmath194 in the bottom right panel . ]      in contrast to the 2-dimensionally broad distribution of the pds for the random configuration , the curves indicate that there exist geometric relations in the atomic configuration .",
    "concretely , the sharp distribution normal to the curve represents a geometric constraint on the rings , whereas the broad distribution along the tangential direction represents a variety of rings .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ silica : pd ] , @xmath174 lies parallel to the death axis on a fixed birth scale .",
    "it follows from the invariance with respect to the input radii after the transformation that the birth scale is determined by the bond between silicon and oxygen .",
    "thus , we can conclude that the geometric constraint in @xmath174 means there is a sharp distribution of the si - o bond length .",
    "on the other hand , the diversity of the arrangements of the rings is mainly controlled by the arrangement of oxygen atoms , and this is represented by the diversity along the death axis .",
    "the death scales in @xmath174 describe the size of ring constructed by si - o network , and hence its diversity corresponds to the ring statistics @xcite . therefore , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ ringstatistics ] , the ring statistics for the shortest path rings @xcite and the death scales in @xmath174 show similar distribution .",
    "even though both of them represent the size distribution of the rings , only the death scale encodes the metric information .",
    "( top ) . both of them represent the size distribution of the rings constructed by si - o network . ]    because the birth and death scales of @xmath186 are controlled by the bond lengths between silicon and oxygen , @xmath186 represents short range order . fig .",
    "[ origin : of : t ] shows both @xmath186 and the @xmath64 for the distorted tetrahedra . here",
    ", the distorted tetrahedra are constructed in such a way that tetrahedra in the local arrangement of sio@xmath195 require si - o and o - o bond lengths to be within the first peak of the distributions . furthermore , their o - si - o angles and si - ooo spherical angles are restricted within the 2.5 and 1.5 times the width of the deviation around their mean value , respectively , determined from the configuration obtained by the md simulation .",
    "we found that the curve for the tetrahedron deviates from the @xmath186 if we remove one of the restrictions above . from this observation",
    ", the agreement of the two pds indicates that the geometric structure represented by the curve @xmath186 is a distortion of the sio@xmath195 tetrahedra .",
    "( red ) and @xmath64 for the distorted tetrahedra ( green ) are described . ]    according to fig .",
    "[ silica : pd ] , the birth scales of @xmath172 and @xmath173 are larger than the death scales of @xmath186 .",
    "this means that they appear after all triangles in sio@xmath195 tetrahedra have been covered by the inflated atomic balls .",
    "in addition , recall that the rings on @xmath172 and @xmath173 consist of the oxygen atoms in the primary rings at @xmath174 .",
    "thus , they are smaller than @xmath174 , representing the order related to the neighboring of tetrahedra , the so - called short range mro ( srmro ) .",
    "the geometric constraint corresponding to @xmath172 shows the relationship between o - o length distribution and o - o - o angle distribution . for further details ,",
    "we refer the reader to the paper @xcite .",
    "because pds can encode many - body atomic structure , we can get a birds - eye view of the geometric hierarchical structure among the various kinds of sro and mro .",
    "the key point is that a curve in a pd encodes an order in the atomic configuration .",
    "namely , the curve @xmath186 represents sro , whereas the curves @xmath196 and @xmath173 show the geometric structure corresponding to mro in amorphous silica consistent with existing methods .    from the invariance to the input radii , we can convert the death scale @xmath21 of each ring to the real space length @xmath197 , which shows the diameter of the ring .",
    "since the death scale for the mro rings ( @xmath196 and @xmath173 ) is determined by oxygen , this diameter is independent of the choice of the input radii .",
    "the paper @xcite shows that this length scale reproduces the typical length scale of mro corresponding to the first sharp diffraction peak .",
    "persistent homology is a suitable tool to extract many - body atomic structures , and successfully describes geometric features of mro .",
    "the topological approach dramatically reduces the degree of freedom to represent the many - body structures , while keeping metric information and qualitatively important geometric features in mro .",
    "several concepts in pd for atomic structures are introduced by choosing two extreme cases : crystalline and random structures . for the crystalline solid ,",
    "the periodic structure yields a few island supports in @xmath114 with high multiplicity , and the diagonal region corresponds to the secondary holes that represent distortion from the primary holes .",
    "the shape fluctuation for each hole is represented as a broadness of the peaks in each island . for the random configuration ,",
    "there are no isolated supports in @xmath114 , and a single broad support is found .",
    "these observations illustrate the power of pds to express many - body atomic structures .    as an example of network forming glass materials , @xmath127 for the silica glass shows neither island support nor single broad support but rather characteristic curves that imply the existence of mro .",
    "the primary curve in @xmath127 describes the size distribution of rings , which is similar to the ring statistics . combining with other curves in @xmath127 , geometric constraint in the mro",
    "is encoded in the pd . with the aid of length scales encoded in pds ,",
    "a hierarchical and multi - scale many - body atomic structures are more successfully represented in an integrated manner compared to the existing methods .",
    "we believe that this method also has a great potential to describe the other disordered systems , such as complex molecular liquids , packed granular materials , and metallic glasses .",
    "the analysis by the persistent homology is an integrated method incorporating the various existing topological tools .",
    "the variables @xmath148 and @xmath119 are the many - body counterparts of the radial distribution function and the coordination number .",
    "the variable @xmath127 in @xmath174 corresponds to the ring statistics .",
    "the variable @xmath128 might correspond to the statistics of the voronoi index , although not mentioned in this paper .",
    "additionally betti numbers @xmath101 shows extensivity at least for monatomic systems .",
    "it is expected that the extensivity is still satisfied for the multi - component system . by using this behavior , the phase transition between macroscopically isotropic phases such as liquid - liquid transition",
    "might hopefully be more clearly categorized in the phase diagram .",
    "suppose that @xmath5 points are sampled from the uniform random distribution in the @xmath198-dimensional box @xmath199^d$ ] .",
    "let the @xmath5-point configuration be denoted as @xmath200 . here",
    "@xmath10 is a @xmath198-dimensional position , and @xmath5 is sufficiently large .",
