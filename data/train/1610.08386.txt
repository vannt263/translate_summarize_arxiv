    "the estimation of extreme level curves is important for identifying extreme events and for characterizing the joint tails of multidimensional distributions .",
    "they are usually considered as quantiles at high levels ; that is , they are linked with a probability @xmath1 of occurrence of certain event , where @xmath1 is a very small number .",
    "this proposal considers values of @xmath1 lower or equal than @xmath2 , where @xmath3 denotes the sample size , which implies that the number of data points that fall beyond the quantile curve is small and can even be zero ; thus we are outside of the observable region , or in other words , in the framework of _ out - sample _ estimation .",
    "this lack of relevant data points makes the estimation difficult , making it necessary to introduce tools from the multivariate extreme value theory .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to provide an _ out - sample _ estimation method for the directional multivariate quantiles recently introduced in @xcite and @xcite . in these papers",
    ", the directional setting refers to the inclusion of a parameter of direction @xmath4 that allows the analysis of data by looking at the cloud of observations from different perspectives .",
    "accurate assessments of these quantiles are sought in a diversity of applications from financial risk management ( e.g. @xcite ) to environmental impact assessment ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a non - parametric estimation method was developed in @xcite to estimate the directional quantile based on the empirical distribution function , which is valid just for the _ in - sample _ scenario ; that is @xmath5 .    both scenarios , _ in - sample _ and _ out - sample _ ,",
    "have been widely studied in the univariate setting and recently the literature has focused on the extension to the multivariate context .",
    "some relevant references in this area can be grouped into three categories as follows .",
    "firstly , estimation under optimization processes ; for instance , those proposals with estimation methods based on linear quantile regression ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . this category contains estimation methods _ in - sample _ such as the proposal by @xcite for his notion of geometric quantiles .",
    "recently @xcite has also proposed an _ out - sample _ estimation method for these geometric quantiles .",
    "a second category contains methods determining level curves of joint density functions in such a way that the set of points outside those contours has a probability equal to a given level @xmath1 .",
    "this method easily describes inner and outer regions at the given level through these curves ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the estimators proposed in this category have been developed mainly for the _ out - sample _ framework .",
    "for instance , @xcite have provided estimation of bivariate contour levels for some joint densities with elliptical and non - elliptical distributions , considering cases with asymptotic dependence and asymptotic independence .",
    "finally , the third category considers level curve estimations using either joint distribution or survival functions ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "works based on copulas are also classified in this group ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these works have introduced proposals in both contexts _ in - sample _ and _ outsample _ , but most of them present the theory or have applications only in the bivariate case .",
    "the proposal developed in this work is inspired in the work of @xcite , where an _ out - sample _",
    "estimator for bivariate level curves of a distribution function @xmath6 was proposed . since our approach",
    "is based on distributions , it belongs to the third category presented above .",
    "the contributions of the paper are two fold : @xmath7 the inclusion of the directional framework given in @xcite to the estimation of multivariate high level sets , and @xmath8 the extension of the _ out - sample _ estimation method in @xcite to any dimension .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : dirextremes ] we summarize the main definitions and results related to the directional multivariate framework used in the paper .",
    "section [ sec : assum ] introduces definitions from the multivariate extreme in order to fix conditions over the random vector @xmath9 to ensure the results of this paper . in section [ sec : qcharacterization ] , the characterization of the elements of the directional multivariate quantiles at high levels based on the heuristic ideas in @xcite are described .",
    "section [ estimation ] presents an _ out - sample _",
    "estimator for these quantiles and also the asymptotic normality of this estimator ( see section [ sec : estimator ] ) .",
    "section [ sec : simexample ] illustrates the estimation procedure comparing both theoretical and estimated results using a multivariate @xmath0distribution to model @xmath9 . finally , in section",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] some conclusions are provided .",
    "this section is introduces the preliminary definitions and notation necessary to understand the contributions of the paper .",
    "as commented in the introduction , the directional multivariate setting was introduced in @xcite , where the main contributions are based on the notion of oriented orthant .",
    "[ def : orthant ] an oriented orthant in @xmath10 with vertex @xmath11 in direction @xmath4 is defined by , @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 is an orthogonal matrix such that @xmath15 , with @xmath16'$ ] .",
    "note that an oriented orthant is a translation and a rotation of the non - negative euclidean orthant toward a vertex in the point @xmath11 and a direction @xmath4 . in @xcite has been pointed out that @xmath14 is not unique for @xmath17 .",
    "then , in order to guarantee uniqueness @xcite have introduced the qr oriented orthant as follows .",
    "let @xmath4 be a unit vector with non - null components and let @xmath18 and @xmath19 be matrices defined as , @xmath20\\quad\\text { and } \\quad m_{\\mathbf{e } } = [ \\mathbf{e},\\ \\ \\mathbf{e}_{2},\\ \\ \\cdots,\\ \\ \\mathbf{e}_{n}],\\ ] ] where @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the @xmath23th component of @xmath4 , @xmath24 is the scalar sign function and @xmath25 is the vector with all its components equal to zero except the @xmath23th component equal to one . if @xmath18 and @xmath19 have qr decompositions , @xmath26 such that @xmath27 and @xmath28 are triangular matrices with positive diagonal elements then the qr decompositions are unique ( see @xcite[theorem 2.1.14 , p.g . 89 ] ) . therefore , @xcite have defined ,    [ def : orthantqr ] the qr oriented orthant with vertex @xmath11 in direction @xmath4 , denoted as @xmath29 , is the oriented orthant satisfying @xmath30 .",
    "we remark that the consideration of directions with non - null components is not restrictive , because if a vector of direction @xmath4 has a null component then the variable associated to the null component can be analyzed separately .",
    "finally , level - sets at certain level @xmath1 in direction @xmath4 have been defined in @xcite as ,    [ def : dirq ] let @xmath9 be a random vector with associated probability distribution @xmath31 . then the directional multivariate quantile at level @xmath1 in direction @xmath4 is defined as @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes the boundary of the subset considered into brackets and @xmath34 .",
    "[ remark1 ] @xcite has pointed out the two possibilities for defining directional multivariate quantiles .",
    "one based on joint distributions and the other based on joint survival functions . to develop the contributions of this paper , we have selected definition [ def : dirq ] based on distributions .    in the univariate",
    "setting , extremes are analyzed considering the two possibilities of exceeding from either distribution or survival functions and most of the extensions of these analyses to the multivariate setting have also been concentrated on these two types of exceeding .",
    "for instance , in the bivariate case @xcite , and generalized multivariate versions are presented in @xcite .",
    "however , the multivariate setting offers infinite possibilities of exceeding to be considered and the directional framework explores these alternatives .",
    "first , notice that the possibilities based on distributions and survival functions are provided through the directions @xmath35 , @xmath36 respectively .",
    "hereafter we will call these _ classical directions_.    second , we point out that there are other interesting directions to be taken into consideration .",
    "for instance in portfolio optimization , the direction given by the portfolio weights of investments is of particular interest because it takes into account the losses due to the composition of the investment in the portfolio ( see @xcite ) . in environmental phenomena ,",
    "the directional approach has also been applied to detect extreme events by considering the direction of maximum variability of the data ( see @xcite ) . in summary , different contexts or phenomena",
    "could suggest different particular directions that consider external information in order to capture the overall behavior of the data and to improve visualization of the results .",
    "in this section , we introduce conditions over @xmath9 that must be satisfied in order to introduce an estimator properly defined of @xmath37 when @xmath38 . we also include some constraints to obtain asymptotic properties of the estimator that we propose .",
    "[ assum1 ] the random vector @xmath9 must be absolutely continuous with increasing marginal distribution functions and such that @xmath39 < \\infty$ ] , for @xmath40 . hereafter ,",
    "these conditions are called _",
    "regularity conditions_.    note that * [ assum1 ] * avoids jump processes .",
    "it was also considered in @xcite to define a multivariate value at risk , where the existence of the first moment of the random vector @xmath9 is important to fix a center of location as a reference point .",
    "hereafter , we can suppose for simplicity that @xmath9 is a random vector with zero mean .",

    "we now introduce a definition for characterizing the tail behavior of @xmath9 .",
    "[ def : regvarying ] a random vector @xmath9 has first order multivariate regular variation with tail index @xmath42 , denoted by @xmath43 , if there exists a real - value function @xmath44 that is regularly varying at infinity is called _ regularly varying at infinity with exponent _",
