    "in 2006 , star measured transverse single - spin asymmetries , @xmath0 , for forward rapidity @xmath3 production in @xmath7 collisions at @xmath8 gev to @xmath9 gev @xcite .",
    "results showed large @xmath0 at high-@xmath1 as seen in previous experiments at lower center - of - mass energies , such as fermilab e704 @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the e704 kinematics , pqcd predictions provide a reasonable description of the observed cross - sections for forward @xmath10 production at @xmath8 gev @xcite .",
    "model calculations based on the sivers @xcite and collins @xcite effects provide fair descriptions of the @xmath1-dependence of the measured asymmetries .",
    "the sivers model relates the asymmetry to correlations involving initial - state parton transverse momentum @xcite while the collins model relates the asymmetry to final - state transverse momentum dependent fragmentation @xcite .",
    "however , the observed asymmetries do not provide an indication of decreasing @xmath0 with increasing @xmath2 , as predicted by theory @xcite .",
    "isolating the origin or , in the case of a combination of effects , disentangling the origins of the observed asymmetries would provide crucial information about proton spin structure .",
    "the previous star measurements @xcite provide a hint of an initial decrease of @xmath0 with @xmath2 for @xmath11 .",
    "the data obtained in this low-@xmath2 , high-@xmath1 region were recorded during 2003 and 2005 , and are limited by low statistics and low polarization . for the 2008 rhic run , star extended measurements to low-@xmath2 , high-@xmath1 kinematics to further investigate this region with better statistics and polarization .     .",
    "[ fig : spinsort],title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "to obtain the measurements for the 2008 run , data were taken with the star forward pion detector ( fpd ) .",
    "the fpd is an electromagnetic calorimeter , consisting of two modules , left and right of the beamline on the east side of star .",
    "each module consists of a @xmath12 array of pbgl calorimeters positioned 809 cm from the interaction point @xcite .",
    "each pbgl calorimeter cell measures @xmath13 @xmath14 . to access the desired low-@xmath2 , high-@xmath1 kinematics , the modules were positioned at @xmath15 .",
    "data were taken from @xmath16 yielding @xmath17 pb@xmath18 with beam polarization , @xmath19 .",
    "events were required to pass a hardware trigger that required a nominal summed energy of 25 gev in a single fpd module .",
    "software cuts were applied for di - photon events , requiring energy sharing @xmath20 and @xmath21 gev / c@xmath22 @xmath23 gev / c@xmath22 , and a software total energy threshold of @xmath24 gev was applied .",
    "the events were required to fall within a fiducial volume of one - half the width of a pbgl cell from the edge of each module .",
    "calibration procedures involved analyzing raw adc s channel - by - channel and run - by - run for pedestal shifts . for gain calibration , @xmath3 mass peaks",
    "were reconstructed channel - by - channel and corrected in an iterative process until convergence to the known value was achieved .",
    "energy - dependent corrections were evaluated by fitting the @xmath3 peak in energy bins , then obtaining a linear fit of the ratio of the known value over the fitted centroids vs. energy .",
    "finally , run - by - run summed - mass values are used to correct for run - dependent gain shifts .",
    "the result is agreement between the di - photon peaks in each module and the known value of the @xmath3 for polarization spin - up or spin - down , fig .",
    "[ fig : spinsort ] .",
    "systmatic errors are dominated by gain calibration issues and yields under the pion mass peak .",
    "gain calibration issues arise because of limited statistics in the pbgl cells that are farthest from the beam in each module . to correct for yields under the pion peak ,",
    "varying mass cuts were studied .",
    "the total systematic uncertainty was obtained by combining the effects in quadrature .",
    "transverse single - spin asymmetries ( @xmath0 ) versus transverse momentum ( @xmath2 ) . for the left - hand figure and nsd sample ( right )",
    "inner error bars are statistical errors only , and outer error bars are statistical plus systematic uncertainties .",
    "points for the mixed event sample ( right ) include only statistical uncertainties and have been offset to the left by 0.03 gev / c.,title=\"fig : \" ]   transverse single - spin asymmetries ( @xmath0 ) versus transverse momentum ( @xmath2 ) . for",

    "results for @xmath27 are consistent with zero , so we show data only for @xmath28 .",
    "results are shown for two different software conditions on the star beam - beam counter ( bbc ) .",
    "first , a software trigger requiring a coincidence between bbc - east ( bbce ) and bbc - west ( bbcw ) is required , producing a nearly pure non - singly - diffractive ( nsd ) event sample .",
    "these data are shown in comparison to previously published data from rhic runs 3 , 5 , and 6 @xcite .",
    "a second event sample is analyzed requiring a hit in bbce , the same side of the collision as the fpd , and no hit in bbcw .",
    "this results in a mixture of nsd and singly - diffractive ( sd ) events .",
    "results from analysis of the mixed sample are shown in comparison with the nearly - pure nsd event sample .",
    "statistical errors are calculated as @xmath29 and scaled to account for remaining acceptance asymmetries , which are less than @xmath30 .",
    "for the nearly - pure nsd event sample , figures show inner error bars for statistical errors and outer error bars for systematic errors combined in quadrature with statistical errors .",
    "errors for the mixed event sample are statistical only .",
    "the systematic uncertainties for the mixed event sample are expected to be less than the statistical errors .",
    "results from rhic run-8 are mostly consistent with results from previous runs , fig . [",
    "fig : anvspt ] ( left ) .",
    "however , in the low-@xmath2 region where previous data were dominated by rhic run 3 with limited statistics , the run-8 data show @xmath0 continuing to decrease . likewise , observing the @xmath2-dependence at fixed @xmath1 , fig .",
    "[ fig : anvsptandxf ] ( left ) , run-8 results show general agreement with previous results in overlapping regions and smooth fall - off toward lower-@xmath2 .",
