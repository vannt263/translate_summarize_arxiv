    "the simplest option for transmitting image information to the catalogue is to build the catalogue such that hypothesis tests against it are identical to  or as close as possible to  hypothesis tests against the raw imaging .",
    "not only is this possible , it is practical in some cases .",
    "for example , the current plan for the spectroscopic output of _ sdss - iii _ _ boss _ is that each individual _ boss _ spectrum will be a list of wavelengths @xmath2 and at each of those wavelengths a flux value @xmath3 and associated inverse uncertainty variance @xmath4 .",
    "these fluxes and inverse variances will not be simply `` best - fit '' values ; they will be the parameters of a model of the likelihood function ( @xcite ) : imagine that for this spectrum an investigator has two possible models @xmath5 and @xmath6 . the fluxes @xmath3 and inverse variances @xmath4 are constructed such that the natural @xmath7 difference @xmath8      -\\sum_i \\left[\\frac{m_1(\\lambda_i)-f_i}{\\sigma_i^2}\\right]\\ ] ] is as close as possible to the @xmath7 difference the investigator _ would have _ obtained had he or she performed the @xmath7 test in the raw spectrograph image pixels . since @xmath7 is related to likelihood by @xmath9 \\quad , \\ ] ] this makes the @xmath3 and @xmath4 the parameters of an approximation to the pixel - level likelihood function .",
    "it is an approximation because it assumes gaussian uncertainty , and small wavelength - to - wavelength covariance ( this latter point is addressed in detail by @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests a general _ definition _ for catalogue elements and their associated uncertainties , which we explicitly advocate here . in the imagined case of _ gaia",
    "_ , the definition would be this : for each star on the sky , there will be six ( or more ) parameters , say @xmath10\\ ] ] and an associated six - by - six inverse covariance matrix @xmath11 .",
    "imagine that for this star an investigator has two proposals @xmath12 and @xmath13 about the six parameters .",
    "we recommend that the catalogue entries @xmath14 and @xmath11 be _ defined _ such that the natural @xmath7 difference @xmath15}^{\\mathsf{t}}}\\cdot{{\\boldsymbol{c}}^{-1}}\\cdot\\left[{{\\boldsymbol{y}}}_2-{{\\boldsymbol{y}}}\\right ]      -{{\\left[{{\\boldsymbol{y}}}_1-{{\\boldsymbol{y}}}\\right]}^{\\mathsf{t}}}\\cdot{{\\boldsymbol{c}}^{-1}}\\cdot\\left[{{\\boldsymbol{y}}}_1-{{\\boldsymbol{y}}}\\right]\\ ] ] is _ as close as possible _ to the logarithmic likelihood ratio @xmath16 $ ] , now _ marginalised over all calibration and instrument parameters _ , that you would have measured if you had access to the raw image pixels and racks of metal .",
    "the proposal is to adopt this definition ; adoption of this is essentially equivalent to obtaining the catalog entries and uncertainties from gaussian fits to the marginalized likelihood .",
    "the nuisance - parameter marginalization takes this beyond the _ boss _ plan and makes it challenging .",
    "marginalisation of a likelihood requires  in the mathematical sense  a prior probability distribution function ( pdf ) over the parameters to be marginalised out and it looks something like this : @xmath17 where the object @xmath18 is the entire raw data set ( pixel intensities ) , @xmath19 is the set of six parameters of the individual object , and @xmath20 is the set of all calibration parameters in the model , including all those related to attitude and hardware .",
    "the unmarginalised likelihood  the probability of the data given the star and calibration parameters  depends , of course , on both the star and the calibration parameters ; the marginalisation is the only conservative and accurate way to propagate uncertainties about calibration into the astrophysical parameters of interest .",
    "the prior @xmath21 is required as a measure on the parameter space that permits integration .",
    "if the entries are defined this way , a catalogue user can make approximations to likelihood comparisons at the pixel level .",
    "unfortunately , this proposal is only sensible when the marginalized likelihoods are close to gaussian in form and when star ",
    "star covariances can be ignored .",
    "these covariances are not expected to be negligible for _ gaia _  ( see holl this volume ) .",
    "however , this will be a problem for almost all of the currently conceived plans for the _ gaia_catalogue .",
    "transmission of star ",
    "star covariances is permitted by our next proposal .",
    "at the present day , in most situations of fitting large ( non - parametric , or highly parameterised ) models to large data sets , investigators report uncertainty information through _ samplings_. a sampling has the disadvantage that it is a mixture - of - delta - functions approximation , but it has the great advantage that it can , in principle , describe an arbitrarly complicated pdf .",
    "there are also excellent sampling technologies available ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .    a useful sampling of _ gaia",
    "_  catalogues could have the following properties : there would be @xmath0 catalogues that represent a sampling  perhaps not a poisson sampling , but a sampling  from the posterior pdf in what you might call `` catalogue space '' .",
    "any experiment or measurement is performed on all @xmath0 samples .",
    "the variance across the @xmath0 outcomes of the @xmath0 identical experiments is an estimate of the uncertainty on the results of the outcome on the primary catalogue . in this vision , the the sampling provides a rank-@xmath0 approximation to the full - catalogue covariance matrix ( which is billions by billions and non - sparse ) .",
    "importantly , in this vision , the sampling of catalogues should be a sampling not just in the space of the astrophysical parameters but also in the space of the attitude and calibration parameters ( the nuisance parameters ) .",
    "this ensures that the variance over samples contains the propagated uncertainty from the nuisance parameters , and it does nt add significantly to any of the technical challenges of producing the sampling .",
    "although there is an enormous literature on sampling methods for large problems , there is a useful hack that might be appropriate if practical sampling methods fail on a problem of this scale : approximate samples can be made by inflating leave - one - out jackknife trials .",
    "the idea would be to cut the raw data stream into @xmath0 equally informative ( roughly speaking , equal - sized ) disjoint subsamples , and construct the @xmath0 complementary leave - one - out subsamples , in each of which one of the @xmath0 disjoint subsamples is left out .",
    "all data analysis ( from raw data to inference of all nuisance and astrophysical parameters through to catalogue generation ) is performed on each of the @xmath0 leave - one - out subsamples .",
    "the _ difference _ ( in catalogue space ) between the primary catalogue and each of the @xmath0 leave - one - out catalogues can be amplified by a factor of ( very close to ) @xmath0 to produce a sampling that has the same full - catalogue variance and covariance as the classical jackknife estimate .",
    "this might be an expedient way to produce and publish the jackknife estimate of the full error covariance , that has most of the good properties of a sampling .",
    "technically , a sampling is a description not of the likelihood but of a posterior pdf , and it has the disadvantage to its users that it has had a prior pdf multiplied in .",
    "this is a fundamental limitation of the approach , but for most kinds of catalogue outputs astronomers are interested in , the data are so informative that the posterior pdf in catalogue space looks very much like the likelihood function unless the adopted priors are extremely informative .",
    "another issue is that additional information ( say , from another telescope or instrument ) , which is expressed as a multiplicative likelihood term , can cause huge changes in the relative posterior probabilities of the @xmath0 catalogue samples .",
    "indeed , all @xmath0 samples may be essentially ruled out by new information , or the samples may fail to capture an important mode in catalogue space .",
    "this is a fundamental limitation of sample - based representations .    in an ideal but challenging world",
    ", a sampling in catalogue space would explore regions of differing _",
    "complexity_. not sure if a star is binary ?",
    "some of the @xmath0 catalogues would have it binary and some would have it single .",
    "there is no reason in principle that the catalogues would be qualitatively similar in cases in which there is real statistical scientific uncertainty .",
    "this complexifies substantially sampling strategies , and complexifies downstream analyses by users , so we leave it here only as a comment . changes to catalogue complexity are handled very naturally by our third proposal .",
    "all this has been about approximations to the likelihood function , which begs the question : why not just publish the likelihood function itself ?",
    "here what we imagine is an interface ( perhaps in the cloud ; see omullane this volume ) to which a user could submit a _",
    "catalogue diff_a difference between the primary _ gaia _  catalogue and the catalogue he or she wants to test .",
    "the machinery behind the interface would use the modified catalogue to generate the raw pixels , compare to the data , and return the _ likelihood diff_. of course the user must be permitted to modify also nuisance parameters , or else be presented with the option of obtaining the results marginalised over these .",
    "an interface of this kind would be expensive to build , run , and maintain ; it is probably impractical at the present day .",
    "however , it would permit literally arbitrary hypothesis testing , and arbitrary calculation of covariances .",
    "it would also make it the responsibility of users to perform their own uncertainty analysis and propagation , relieving the teams of some of their most burdensome duties .",
    "extremely clever systems could cache computation so subsequent users could benefit from the users that have come before .",
    "however , without technology development , this proposal is probably impractical for the _ gaia _  data .",
    "_ how big do you have to make @xmath0 ? _ there is no simple answer ; this depends on the complexity of the posterior pdf and the precision with which users need to know their uncertainties .",
    "our attitude is that you never  in any finite experiment ",
    "know your _ uncertainties _ to high precision , so we have the intuition that @xmath0 does not have to be large to be an enormous improvement over a single catalogue with reported single - star uncertainties .",
    "one order - of - magnitude option for @xmath0 in the case of _ gaia _  is the number of _ visits _ , the number of times the spacecraft scans across a typical star .",
    "jackknifing more finely than this will not help much on individual - star uncertainties .    _",
    "but if anyone can make their own catalogue , the data will be changing ; the science wo nt be repeatable ! _",
    "this point is good ; published science needs to be repeatable by referees and subsequent investigators . on the other hand",
    ", our _ understanding _ of the _ gaia _  data will necessarily evolve as calibrations and physical models evolve .",
    "there is no hope for a completely stable catalogue . what _ is _ fixed is the set of raw pixel data .",
    "the approaches advocated here make the raw data the primary objects of release , and therefore tie the release to the only part of the data analysis that _ is _ stable and repeatable .",
    "of course , it is necessary for reasons of repeatability to clearly tag , cut , and release well - documented and stable versions of the data , likelihood function , and primary catalogue .",
    "_ is there any relevant difference between a bayesian and a frequentist ? _",
    "bayesianism is required for marginalization , because the prior provides the measure for integration .",
    "however , bayesians and frequentists agree  or should agree  that the most important publication of an experiment is the _",
    "likelihood function_. it is through the likelihood that data impact our beliefs ; different investigators have different priors , different objectives , and different external data at their disposal .",
    "they can only combine these with the _ gaia _  data properly if the likelihood function is exposed . even if the _ gaia _",
    "outputs end up being a sampling of some posterior pdf , those samples should come with evaluations of the prior , so that subsequent users can divide it out before combining with their own individual knowledge and data .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank anthony brown , francoise crifo , ken freeman , and lennart lindegren , whose comments _ during _ the meeting shaped these ideas in real time , and coryn bailer - jones , jo bovy , and sam roweis for valuable discussions .",
