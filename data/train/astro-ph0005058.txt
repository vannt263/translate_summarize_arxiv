    "observations of clusters at high redshift ( @xmath1 ) can directly constrain cosmological models ( e.g. bahcall & fan @xcite ) , but searches based on colours or narrow band emission have not established the presence of massive clusters ( le fvre et al .  @xcite ; pascarelle et al .",
    "@xcite ; keel et al .",
    "there are several indications ( e.g. pentericci et al .",
    "@xcite ) that powerful radio galaxies at high redshift ( hzrgs ) tend to be in the center of forming clusters .",
    "the powerful radio galaxy pks 1138262 at redshift 2.156 is a prime example of a forming brightest cluster galaxy and has extensively been studied ( e.g.  pentericci et al.@xcite ) .",
    "the arguments for 1138262 being at the center of a cluster include ( a ) the very clumpy morphology as observed by the hst ( pentericci et al .",
    "@xcite ) , reminiscent of a massive merging system ; ( b ) the extremely distorted radio morphology and the detection of the largest radio rotation measures ( 6200 rad m@xmath2 ) in a sample of more than 70 hzrgs , indicating that 1138262 is surrounded by a hot , clumpy and dense magnetized medium ( carilli et al .  @xcite ; pentericci et al .",
    "@xcite ) ; ( c ) the detection of x - ray emission around 1138262 ( carilli et al .  1998 ) , indicating the presence of hot cluster gas , although a contribution to the x - ray luminosity by the agn can not be precluded . for this reason",
    ", we chose 1138262 to carry out a pilot study with the vlt , to search for direct evidence of clusters at high redshift .",
    "there are various techniques for detecting high redshift companion galaxies .",
    "the colour selection technique used to find lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) ( steidel & hamilton @xcite ) is not feasible at the redshift of 1138262 , since the lyman limit falls at 2878  , which is well below the atmospheric cutoff .",
    "therefore we have adopted the strategy of narrow band imaging at the wavelength of the redshifted line .",
    "this technique is capable of detecting galaxies at redshifts similar to the radio galaxy redshift having strong  emission .",
    "narrow and broad band imaging was carried out on april 12 and 13 , 1999 with the 8.2 m vlt antu ( ut1 ) using fors in imaging mode .",
    "a narrow band filter was used which has a central wavelength of 3814   and a fwhm of 65  . for 1138262 the emission of ly@xmath3 at 1216   is redshifted to 3838  , which falls within the range of the narrow band filter .",
    "the broad band filter was a bessel b with central wavelength of 4290   and a fwhm of 880  , which receives both continuum and redshifted  line emission .",
    "the detector was a tektronix ccd with 2048@xmath4 pixels and a scale of 0.2@xmath5 per pixel .",
    "eight separate 30 minutes exposures were taken in narrow band and six 5 minutes exposures in b , shifted by @xmath6 20@xmath5 with respect to each other to minimize flat fielding problems and to facilitate cosmic ray removal .",
    "the average seeing was 0.8@xmath5 and the 1@xmath7 limiting ab magnitude per square arcsecond was 27.8 for the narrow and 28.1 for the broad band image .",
    "image reduction was carried out using the iraf reduction package .",
    "the individual images were bias subtracted and flat fielded by twilight flat fields for the narrow band and an average of the unregistered science exposures for the broad band .",
    "the images were then registered by shifting them in position by an amount determined from the location of several stars on the ccd .",
    "the registered images were co - added and cosmic rays removed . to improve the signal to noise and the sensitivity to faint extended objects ,",
    "the resulting images were smoothed with a gaussian function having a fwhm of 1@xmath5 .",
    "the spectrophotometric standard star gd108 ( oke @xcite ) was used to calibrate the fluxes in broad and narrow band .",
    "calibration in broad band is accurate to 0.1 magnitude , but absorption lines and a small break in the part of the spectrum of gd108 which falls in the narrow band inhibits equally accurate calibration for this filter .",
    "instead , it was assumed that the spectrum is flat in this wavelength range and the narrow band is calibrated relative to the broad band with an accuracy of 0.2 magnitude , as estimated from the spectrum of gd108 .",
    "we assume that the median equivalent width ( ew ) of a random sample of objects is equal to zero .",
    "since the median ew of our sample calibrated by the standard star is equal to 0.5 @xmath8 erg s@xmath9 cm@xmath2 @xmath9 , we subtract this number from the narrow band flux densities of the extracted objects to compute the ew . in this way",
    ", we do not rely on the absolute flux calibration .",
    "detection and photometry of objects in the field around 1138262 was carried out using sextractor ( bertin & arnouts , 1996 ) .",
    "we have taken advantage of all observing time by normalizing and adding the narrow and broad band images to obtain maximum signal to noise for the majority of objects , which resulted in the extraction of 1727 sources .",
    "all detections have at least 9 connected pixels with a value equal or larger than 2.5 times the rms sky noise . during this first application of sextractor ,",
    "aperture sizes and shapes were determined for each object separately .",
    "we gave the choice of aperture careful consideration by comparing the signal - to - noise for fixed circular apertures with a range of sizes and for elliptical apertures with a range of scale factors .",
    "the half lengths of the principal axes of the elliptical apertures are @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the ellipticity determined by the isophots of the object , @xmath14 the first moment of the radial ( non - elliptical ) light distribution and @xmath15 a scale factor .",
    "the highest average signal - to - noise for faint objects was obtained with elliptical apertures using @xmath16 . the apertures determined in this way",
    "were used to carry out photometry on the narrow and broad band images .",
    "objects displaying twice as much flux density in the narrow band as in broad band have ew 65  .",
    "this equals to a rest frame ew of 20.5  , very close to the 20   used as selection criterium by steidel et al .",
    "( @xcite , s99 ) .",
    "there are 60 objects with ew larger than 65   and narrow band flux density of at least 2 @xmath8 erg s@xmath9 cm@xmath2 @xmath9 .",
    "the signal - to - noise of these objects is at least 10 in narrow band , making the ew computation meaningful .",
    "we consider these to be candidate  emitting galaxies .",
    "we subdivide the candidates in very promising ones with ew three times this value ( 13 ) and promising ones with ew two times this value ( 11 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ selection ] .",
    "ten candidates coincide with peaks in the extended ( @xmath6 160 kpc ) halo of ionized hydrogen around the radio galaxy .",
    "so in total , there are 50 previously unknown emitters with a range of narrow band fluxes from 0.1 to 5@xmath17 ergs s@xmath9 cm@xmath2 .",
    "the positions of the emitters are shown in fig .",
    "[ positions ] .",
    "images of three candidates are shown in fig .",
    "[ 3cand ] .",
    "we believe that there will be few or no low redshift interlopers , since [ ] @xmath183727 at redshift 0.02 is the only strong line which falls in the narrow band filter , apart from  at redshift 2.14 .",
    "galaxies at redshift 0.02 would easily be identified by their large angular size .",
    "since the narrow band is positioned on the blue side of the broad band , our sample will not be contaminated by objects with abnormal colors as extremely red objects or red m dwarfs or by objects with a break in their spectrum around 3900   as lbgs at @xmath19 .",
    "contamination by bright quasars will be small , since their surface density ( 0.04 arcmin@xmath2 ; thompson et al.@xcite ) is low enough that not more than 2 quasars will appear in our field .",
    "although there still is a possibility that we have selected some rare , very blue objects with u - b @xmath20 -1.3 , we shall assume for the remainder of this paper that all objects with ew @xmath21   are  emitting galaxies .",
    "is there an enhanced density of galaxies around 1138262 ? do the candidates make up a forming cluster ?",
    "the number of 50  emitters in the 35.4 arcmin@xmath4 field ( @xmath22 arcmin@xmath4 is rendered unusable by bright stars ) is equivalent to a surface density of 1.4 per arcmin@xmath4 .",
    "the comoving volume for this field size ( 8.3 mpc@xmath4 ) and redshift range ( @xmath23 ) is 4758 mpc@xmath24 , resulting in a volume density of @xmath25 emitters per mpc@xmath24 .",
    "a contour plot of surface density does not show a strong concentration of emitters centered on the radio galaxy or anywhere else in the field .",
    "the angular two point correlation function was determined by the landy - szalay estimator ( landy & szalay @xcite ) .",
    "due to the occurence of close pairs in our sample , the correlation function shows a signal at short distances , but there is no evidence that the distribution of emitters is significantly different from a random distribution on scales larger than 20 .",
    "s99 present an overview of luminosity functions of three emission searches in their fig .",
    "we have converted our luminosities to star formation rate ( sfr ) using the relation l@xmath26(1500 ) = 8.0@xmath27 ( sfr / m@xmath28 yr@xmath9 ) ergs s@xmath9 hz@xmath9 ( madau et al .",
    "@xcite ) and computed the number of emitters ( omitting the radio galaxy halo objects ) per sfr bin per mpc@xmath24 assuming @xmath29 for all emitters .",
    "the central wavelength of the b filter is 1366   in the restframe , which is close enough to 1500   to omit a k - correction carried out with an uncertain spectral index .",
    "[ lumfun ] shows that the density of the cluster companions of 1138262 ( plus signs with vertical error bars ) is comparable to the near - qso search of campos et al .",
    "( @xcite ) at @xmath30 , which represents a small overdensity relative to the blank field search of cowie & hu ( @xcite ) at @xmath31 .",
    "the density is , however , lower than the lyman break galaxy _ spike _ of s99 at @xmath32 .",
    "we have assumed that properties of forming clusters and galaxies do not change too fast to allow meaningful comparison between clusters at different epochs .",
    "the figure also shows that we detect sfr as low as 1 h@xmath2 m@xmath28 yr@xmath9 , while cowie & hu ( @xcite ) and s99 reach their sensitivity limit at about 8 h@xmath2 m@xmath28 yr@xmath9 .",
    "this is due , in part , to our sampling of a lower redshift range .",
    "although we have detected a number of  emitters in the field of 1138262 , from the present data it is impossible to unambiguously determine whether a significant fraction of these objects form part of the presumed cluster around 1138262 .",
    "note that the observations described here can only detect galaxies with bright  emission lines not attenuated by dust and these might comprise merely a small fraction of the galaxy content of the presumed cluster .",
    "first , of the whole population of lbgs as studied by s99 only 20% have a lya rest ew 20  .",
    "about 50% of the lbgs have the lya region even in absorption .",
    "second , only a fraction of the cluster galaxies are likely to be actively forming stars .",
    "we assume that the ratio of early to late type galaxies in the cluster around 1138262 is the same as the 1.1:1 ratio in intermediate redshift ( @xmath33 ) clusters as found by andreon ( @xcite ) .",
    "taking these two factors into account , the detected  galaxies might comprise only 10% of the cluster galaxies present around 1138262 .",
    "in addition to this , we miss galaxies emitting  outside the limited range of wavelength covered by our narrow band filter .",
    "assuming that the radio galaxy is at rest with respect to the cluster , the wavelength of  from galaxies with a positive velocity greater than 860 km s@xmath9 falls outside the fwhm of the filter . since present day clusters have velocity dispersions as large as @xmath34 km s@xmath9 ( mazure et al .",
    "@xcite ) , we miss 15% of the velocity range of the presumed cluster around 1138262 if we assume the same velocity dispersion for clusters at high redshift .",
    "we have detected 50 candidate  emitters close to radio galaxy 1138262 at redshift 2.2 .",
    "these  emitters are candidate starburst galaxies in the cluster , which is presumed to exist or to be forming around 1138262 .",
    "we do not find a significant overdensity of candidates compared to luminosity functions of blank fields nor do we detect a strong concentration gradient in our 8 mpc@xmath4 field . the next step in our search for clusters at high redshift",
    "is to confirm the existence of the  emitters by multi object spectroscopy at the vlt and determine the spatial correlation function and velocity dispersion , which together with the size of the cluster will give a direct estimate of the total mass .",
    "additionally , we will carry out x - ray observations of 1138262 with the chandra telescope .",
