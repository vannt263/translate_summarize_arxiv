    "the 50 years old quark mixing @xcite is the key for strange particles to decay and for the weak cp violation to be realized in the standard model ( sm ) @xcite .",
    "existence of cp violation is one key element for baryon number generation , the baryogenesis . at present , however , we can not relate the weak cp violation , satisfying ` baryon number conservation ' , to the cp violation needed for the baryogenesis employing ` baryon number violation ' .",
    "nevertheless , the weak cp violation study might hints physics far above the electroweak scale and hopefully to the cp phase appearing in the baryogenesis .",
    "this may come by observing a deviation from the sm prediction or completion of the weak cp violation in an ultraviolet completed theory beyond the sm . in any case , completing the sm is achieved by the complete determination of the quark and lepton mixing matrices , and hence determining the mixing matrices in terms of an exact form is of fundamental importance .    the original kobayashi - maskawa ( km ) model for weak cp violation in the sm is represented by the km unitary matrix @xmath7 .",
    "the cabibbo angle @xmath8 , the @xmath9 element of @xmath7 , is known to be small but not too small , @xmath10 , and hence can be a good expansion parameter . a decade after the km matrix",
    ", wolfenstein expressed the matrix elements in terms of powers of @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the wolfenstein parametrization introduces four parameters as required : three real parameters @xmath12 , and an imaginary parameter @xmath13 , @xmath14 which is very useful in fitting the weak cp violation data @xcite .",
    "even though the imaginary number @xmath13 is introduced , it is not a phase .",
    "if any parametrization is introducing an invariant phase , a unitary transformation should not change its determinant .",
    "the determinant of the original km matrix has a phase @xcite , while the chau - keung - maiani form does not have a phase @xcite . if the phase is present , it is related to the phase of the quark mass matrix , arg.det.@xmath15",
    ". this can be rotated away if there exists the peccei - quinn symmetry @xcite",
    ". if there is no peccei - quinn symmetry , one may resort to calculable vacuum angle ( @xmath16 ) models @xcite where one starts with arg.det.@xmath17 .",
    "therefore , the determinant of a well - defined quark mixing matrix better does not have a phase .",
    "a posteriori , the ( 13 ) and ( 31 ) elements are known to be very small @xmath18 . also , it is known that the third generation is needed to have the weak cp violation .",
    "in addition , specifically , if either the ( 13 ) or ( 31 ) element is zero , there is no cp violation . in general ,",
    "if any one element among nine elements of the ckm matrix is zero , then there is no weak cp violation since one can find an appropriate phase redefinition such that all the ckm elements become real . in the wolfenstein form , the product of ( 13 ) , ( 22 ) and",
    "( 31 ) elements , appearing among six terms of the determinant , is a barometer of cp violation , @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "but in the wolfenstein form , the case ( 13 ) or ( 31 ) element vanishing is not parametrized by one parameter .",
    "therefore , there is a need to parametrize the weak cp violation in a better form where vanishing of one parameter makes either ( 13 ) or ( 31 ) element vanishing .",
    "in fact , qin and ma ( qm ) realizes this scheme which is identical to the wolfenstein form with the qm phase interpreted by those of eq .",
    "( [ eq : wolfdetphase ] ) , @xmath22 @xcite . in these @xmath23",
    "expanded forms , the weak cp violation occurs at order @xmath24 .",
    "when we calculate the determinant of the approximate quark mixing matrix , the cp phase appears at order @xmath24 . therefore , to keep track of the cp violation under different definitions of @xmath7 , we must consider the phases appearing in the higher orders as denoted below . let us consider a modified wolfenstein form so that the magnitudes of ( 13 ) and ( 31 ) components are represented by @xmath25 and @xmath26 . by one parameter , @xmath27 or @xmath28 , the ( 13 ) or ( 31 ) element becomes zero . since vanishing of ( 13 ) or ( 31 ) element leads to no weak cp violation , it is a useful representation .",
    "in addition , if all the elements of @xmath7 are real , there is no weak cp violation .",
    "therefore , for the weak cp violation , taking an imaginary part is essential .",
    "the test is provided by the six contributions in the determinant of @xmath7 . obviously , if all six terms in the determinant are real , there is no cp violation . even though the whole determinant is real , the complex individual parts describe the existence of cp violation .",
    "a similar trend is observed in the decay of a particle : due to the cpt theorem the total decay rate and mass of the antiparticle is the same as those of the particle , but the individual decay rates can be different for a particle and its antiparticle .",
    "thus , one component among six of the determinant entries , _ i.e. _  @xmath29 is the barometer , as proved below .",
    "so , it is convenient to put the phase at one place among the ( 13 ) and ( 31 ) elements .",
    "we suggest to put the phase in the ( 31 ) element , @xmath30 .",
    "then , the weak cp violation is absent if @xmath31 or @xmath28 , or @xmath32 , as anticipated . in this form ,",
    "the jarlskog determinant is @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , we suggest a modified form from the wolfenstein and qm parametrizations , valid up to @xmath34 ,    @xmath35 -\\lambda+\\frac{\\lambda^5}{2}(\\kappa_t^2-\\kappa_b^2 ) , \\quad   & \\begin{array}{l } 1-\\frac{\\lambda^2}{2}-\\frac{\\lambda^4}{8}-\\frac{\\lambda^6}{16 } \\\\[0.2em ] -\\frac{\\lambda^4}{2}(\\kappa_t^2+\\kappa_b^2 - 2\\kappa_b\\kappa_t e^{-i\\delta})\\\\[0.2em ] -\\frac{\\lambda^6}{12}\\left(7 \\kappa_b^2+\\kappa_t^2 - 8\\kappa_t \\kappa_b e^{-i \\delta}\\right ) \\end{array } ,       & \\begin{array}{l } \\lambda^2\\left(\\kappa_b-\\kappa_t e^{-i\\delta } \\right ) \\\\[0.2em ]   -\\frac{\\lambda^4}{6}(2\\kappa_t e^{-i \\delta}+\\kappa_b ) \\end{array}\\\\ [ 2.5em ]        -\\lambda^3 \\kappa_t e^{i\\delta}\\left(1+\\frac{\\lambda^2}{3}\\right ) ,   & \\begin{array}{l }   -\\lambda^2\\left(\\kappa_b-\\kappa_t e^{i\\delta } \\right)\\\\[0.2em ]   -\\frac{\\lambda^4}{6}(2\\kappa_b+ \\kappa_te^{i\\delta } ) \\end{array }   , & \\begin{array}{c } 1-\\frac{\\lambda^4}{2}(\\kappa_t^2+\\kappa_b^2        -2\\kappa_b\\kappa_t e^{i\\delta})\\\\[0.2em ] -\\frac{\\lambda^6}{6 } \\left(2[\\kappa_b^2+\\kappa_t^2]-\\kappa_t \\kappa_b e^{i \\delta } \\right ) \\end{array } \\end{array}\\right ) \\label{eq : ksrotated } \\end{split}\\ ] ]    note that our @xmath23 is the whole element of @xmath36 . from the absolute values of ( 11 ) , ( 12 ) , ( 13 ) , and ( 31 ) entries ( @xmath37 ) and the ratio @xmath38 of the measured ckm matrix @xcite , three real parameters are determined by the quadrature , @xmath39 where we also included the phase determined by the shape of the ( 13 ) jarlskog triangle @xcite .",
