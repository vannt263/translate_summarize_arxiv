    "membranes of multiple components , such as 1,2-dioleoyl - sn - glycero-3-phosphocholine ( dopc ) , dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine ( dppc ) and cholesterol , are receiving widespread attention because of their applications in many fields of science and technology , and numerous studies on the morphological changes have been conducted @xcite . in these membranes ,",
    "morphological changes are induced by a phase separation .",
    "indeed , the phase separation causes domain formation and domain pattern transition between the liquid - ordered ( @xmath0 ) and the liquid - disordered ( @xmath1 ) phases .",
    "this domain pattern transition accompanies the morphological changes , such as the two circular domains , the stripe domain , the raft domain and the so - called budding domain @xcite .",
    "the multiplicity of components , as in a glass transition @xcite , is essential for such a variety of morphologies . to date",
    ", these morphologies have been studied on the basis of the line tension energy @xcite in the context of the helfrich - polyakov ( hp ) model for membranes @xcite .",
    "the line tension energy is defined on the domain boundary and has an important role in the morphological changes @xcite .",
    "however , the origin of the line tension energy is not well understood .",
    "in fact , it is unclear what type of internal structure is connected to the line tension energy until now .",
    "the problem that should be asked is where the line tension energy originates .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we clarify and discuss the microscopic origin of the line tension energy .    to understand the origin of the line tension energy , we introduce new degrees of freedom @xmath2 to represent the @xmath0 and @xmath1 phases .",
    "the ising model hamiltonian , which we call aggregation energy , for the variable @xmath3 is included in the general hp model hamiltonian , where the `` general '' hp model refers to the hp model with a nontrivial surface metric @xmath4 .",
    "note that the general hp model can be discretized on triangulated surfaces and becomes well defined only when it is treated in the context of finsler geometry @xcite .",
    "moreover , note that our strategy towards the multi - component membrane in this paper is a coarse - graining of the detailed information on the chemical structures of dopc , dppc and cholesterol and on the interaction between them with the help of the variable @xmath3 and hp surface model .",
    "in addition , from the viewpoint of modelling , it is very natural to extend the hp model to the general hp model for explaining the morphological changes in multi - component membranes .",
    "indeed , the hp model is considered as a straight forward extension of the linear chain model for polymers @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in subsection [ cont - model ] , we introduce the continuous hamiltonian , which is identical to the polyakov hamiltonian @xcite . in subsection [ disc - model ] , we introduce the two - component surface model , which is defined by including the aggregation energy in the hamiltonian of the fg surface model .",
    "the aggregation energy is defined by the variable @xmath3 , which is introduced to label the triangles with @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the monte carlo ( mc ) technique is briefly discussed in section [ mc - technique ] , and the mc results are presented in section [ results ] . finally , we summarize the results in section [ conclusion ] . in appendix [ surface - model ] , we describe the technical details of the fg modelling . in subsection",
    "[ discrete - model ] , the discretization of the continuous model introduced in subsection [ cont - model ] is described , and a discrete model is obtained . from this discrete model ,",
    "we obtain the model for two - component membranes by imposing a constraint on the metric function . in [ surface - orientation ] , we show that the models constructed in [ discrete - model ] are ill defined in the conventional modelling and that the models become well defined only in the context of finsler geometry modelling .",
    "we begin with a continuous surface model , which is defined by the polyakov hamiltonian or the gaussian energy @xmath5 for membranes and the bending energy @xmath6 with a metric @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the local coordinate of the two - dimensional parameter space @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "both of the energies are defined by the surface position @xmath10 such that @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the determinant of the @xmath13 matrix @xmath14 of the metric function and @xmath15 is its inverse @xcite .",

    "is treated from the perspective of statistical mechanics .",
    "these are the hp model @xcite corresponding to polymerized membranes , and the hp model and the landau - ginzburg model @xcite have been thoroughly investigated @xcite .",
    "first , in this subsection , let us introduce a new degree of freedom @xmath3 , which has only two - different values ( @xmath27 , on the triangulated lattice ( see figure [ fig - a1 ] in appendix [ surface - model ] ) .",
    "we assume that the variable @xmath28 is defined on the triangle @xmath29 , and moreover , the values of @xmath28 correspond to two different phases , namely , the liquid - ordered ( @xmath0 ) and the liquid - disordered ( @xmath1 ) phases , such that @xmath30 this definition of @xmath3 implies that every triangle is labelled by the value of @xmath3 , and therefore , @xmath3 represents the phase ( or domain ) to which the triangle @xmath31 belongs .",
    "we now introduce a discrete hamiltonian for multi - component membranes .",

    ", the energy @xmath75 at the bond @xmath63 has a non - zero positive value only when the bond is on the domain boundary between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath76 is proportional to the total number of bonds that form the domain boundary because the mean bond length is constant ( or non - zero finite ) on the boundary .",
    "we comment on the reason why @xmath36 is considered as the line tension energy in more detail .",
    "first , the fact that the mean bond length becomes constant is understood from the scale - invariant property of the partition function @xmath74 in eq .",

    "indeed , we have @xmath77 @xcite .",

    "the relation @xmath77 means that @xmath85 is constant .",

    "this constant @xmath87 varies depending on whether the bond @xmath63 belongs to @xmath0 , @xmath1 or the boundary between @xmath0 and @xmath1 because the coefficient @xmath48 varies depending on these domains and domain boundary as in eq .",
    "( [ kappa - and - gamma ] ) .",
    "for this reason and because @xmath88 , we understand that the bond length on the boundary between @xmath0 and @xmath1 becomes well defined ( or non - zero finite ) .",
    "importantly , the mean bond length is expected to be finite , although it fluctuates around the mean value and the mean value itself varies depending on the domains or the domain boundary .",
    "therefore , @xmath89 is considered to be an extension of the line tension energy because @xmath76 is proportional to the length of the phase boundary if the two phases are clearly separated as the domains @xmath0 and @xmath1 at least .",
    "the remaining problem to be clarified is how the domain boundary is formed on the triangulated surfaces . during experiments , the area fraction of @xmath0 ( and @xmath1 )",
    "is fixed @xcite .",
    "hence , in our model the total number of triangles @xmath90 for @xmath91 ( and @xmath92 for @xmath93 ) is fixed , where the total number of triangles @xmath94 is also fixed to be constant ( because @xmath95 and the total number @xmath84 of vertices is fixed ) .",
    "the relation between the area fraction of @xmath0 and the fraction of @xmath90 will be described in the next section .",
    "another constraint imposed on the triangles in our model is that the value of @xmath28 of triangle @xmath45 remains unchanged for all @xmath45 during the simulations .",
    "therefore , the triangles themselves have to diffuse over the surface to form the @xmath0 and @xmath1 domains .",
    "this triangle diffusion is numerically possible on the dynamically triangulated surfaces , which are called triangulated fluid surfaces , via the monte carlo ( mc ) technique with dynamical triangulation , as described above @xcite .",
