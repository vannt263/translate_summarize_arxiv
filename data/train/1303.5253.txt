    "the supersymmetric ( susy ) models of quantum mechanics ( qm ) provide one of the most fertile grounds for the growth of ideas , germinating out from the branches of mathematics and physics , in a physically meaningful manner ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a decisive feature of these models is the observation that , at the classical level , the commuting variables of the theory transform to their anticommuting counterparts and vice - versa due to the presence of a fermionic susy symmetry in the theory . at the quantum level ,",
    "susy qm admits two hamiltonians ( and corresponding states ) which are connected to each - other , in a specific manner , because of the presence of the above quoted fermionic susy symmetry .",
    "the existence of the latter is one of the hallmarks of any arbitrary susy quantum mechanical theory in any arbitrary dimension of spacetime .",
    "a very special class of the above susy qm is the one which is characterized by the existence of two fermionic @xmath1 charges ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) and the ( bosonic ) hamiltonian @xmath4 of the theory which obey a specific @xmath5 susy algebra .",
    "all these charges generate continuous symmetry transformations that also satisfy the above algebra in their operator form .",
    "these sets of susy quantum mechanical systems are known as the general @xmath5 susy models .",
    "some of the physical examples of such a class of theories have been recently shown to be endowed with a novel set of discrete symmetry transformations .",
    "the interplay of the discrete and usual continuous symmetry transformations has led to establish that the @xmath5 susy models provide the _ physical _ examples of hodge theory @xcite .    in a very recent paper @xcite",
    ", we also conjectured that any arbitrary @xmath5 susy quantum mechanical model would provide a physical example for the hodge theory where the de rham cohomological operators , hodge duality operation , degree of a form , etc .",
    ", of differential geometry would find their physical realizations in the language of symmetry properties of the above susy systems .",
    "the purpose of our present investigation is to give the proof of the above conjecture for any arbitrary @xmath5 susy model with any arbitrary superpotential .",
    "we show that this general model is endowed with discrete symmetry transformations which , together with the usual continuous symmetry transformations , provide the physical realizations of _ all _ the cohomological operators of differential geometry .",
    "in fact , there exists a novel duality symmetry in the theory and all aspects of the cohomological operators are realized in the language of symmetry properties and conserved charges ( and their eigenvalues ) .    in our earlier works @xcite ,",
    "we have shown that the 2d usual ( non-)abelian 1-form gauge theories , 4d abelian 2-form gauge theory and 6d abelian 3-form gauge theory provide perfect models for the hodge theory within the framework of becchi - rouet - stora - tyutin ( brst ) formalism . furthermore , exploiting the hodge decomposition theorem and choosing the physical state to be the harmonic state , we have shown that the 2d ( non-)abelian 1-form gauge theories provide a new model for the topological field theory ( tft ) @xcite which captures a part of the key aspects of witten - type tfts @xcite and some salient features of schwarz - type tfts @xcite .",
    "none of the above theories @xcite are , however , supersymmetric in nature .",
    "the central goal of our present endeavour is to first study the general @xmath5 susy quantum mechanical system and gain deep insights into its mathematical and physical structures and comment on the generalization of these ideas , if possible , to the study of @xmath5 susy gauge theories of phenomenological interest .",
    "the following factors have propelled us to pursue our present investigation .",
    "first and foremost , it is of utmost importance for us to provide a concrete proof of our earlier conjecture that any arbitrary @xmath5 susy quantum mechanical model would provide a tractable physical example of a hodge theory .",
    "second , it is always an important endeavour to state a general rule for the solution of a given problem . in our present work",
    ", we have provided a general answer to a general question of physical importance .",
    "finally , we are very hopeful that we shall be able to apply our current ideas to @xmath5 susy gauge theories which might turn out to be the field theoretic model for a ( quasi-)topological field theory as well as an example of a hodge theory .    in the broader perspective , our present study is essential besides the above cited factors of motivations .",
    "it is quite possible that our present study would enable us to count the correct degrees of freedom associated with the fields of a @xmath5 susy quantum gauge theory in a given dimension of spacetime . to achieve the above goal",
    ", we shall have to exploit the hodge decomposition theorem in the quantum hilbert space of this specific susy gauge theory under consideration .",
    "since the most symmetric state would turn out to be the harmonic state , we shall be forced to choose it as the physical state of the theory .",
    "the annihilation of this state by the supercharges would lead to the correct counting of the degrees of freedom .",
    "it is gratifying to state that we have already performed such kind of analysis in our earlier works on the _ usual _ 2d free ( non-)abelian gauge theories @xcite .",
    "we are very hopeful that our ideas of the earlier works @xcite would persist even in the case of @xmath5 susy quantum gauge theories in a specific dimension of spacetime where we shall be able to obtain the perfect susy quantum gauge models for the hodge theory as well as , possibly , a set of susy examples of tfts .",
    "the contents of our present paper are organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 , we concisely recapitulate the bare essentials of superspace approach to @xmath5 susy qm and derive the lagrangian and its associated continuous susy transformations . our sect",
    ". 3 deals with the derivation of conserved charges from the noether theorem .",
    "we discuss various discrete symmetry transformations of the lagrangian of our theory in sect .",
    "4 . we devote time on the algebraic structures of various symmetry transformations in sect .",
    "5 and show their relevance to the cohomological aspects of differential geometry .",

    "7 .    in our appendix",
    ", we provide the proof for the specific @xmath5 algebra amongst the supercharges and hamiltonian of our present susy theory in a simpler form .",
    "we begin with a @xmath5 supervariable @xmath6 on a @xmath7-dimensional supermanifold which is characterized by the superspace coordinates @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the bosonic ( @xmath10 ) variable and @xmath11 are a pair of grassmann variables ( with @xmath12 ) .",
    "we note that , later on , the ordinary variable @xmath9 would turn out to be the evolution parameter for the susy quantum mechanical system .",
    "the above supervariable can be expanded , along the grassmannian directions , as @xcite @xmath13 where ( @xmath14 ) are the basic dynamical variables and @xmath15 is an auxiliary variable for our susy quantum mechanical system .",
    "we note that the variables ( @xmath16 ) form a bosonic pair and ( @xmath17 ) ( with @xmath18 ) are their susy counterparts ( i.e. fermionic pair of variables ) .",
    "all these variables are function of the evolution parameter @xmath9 .    the two supercharges @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( with @xmath19 ) , for the above @xmath5 susy general quantum mechanical theory",
    ", are defined as @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 are the partial derivatives defined on the @xmath7-dimensional supermanifold .",
    "the latter turn out to be the generators for the translations along @xmath22 directions as illustrated below : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the infinitesimal shift transformation parameters along the grassmannian directions of the @xmath7-dimensional supermanifold .",
    "thus , they are fermionic ( @xmath26 ) in nature .",
    "the susy transformation @xmath27 on the supervariable @xmath28 can be expressed in terms of the supercharges @xmath2 and @xmath3 as illustrated above .",
    "the transformation @xmath27 can be divided into two infinitesimal transformations @xmath29 and @xmath30 because of the presence of @xmath5 susy qm .",
    "these are juxtaposed as : @xmath31 where we have defined @xmath32 it can be readily checked that @xmath29 and @xmath30 are off - shell nilpotent of order two ( i.e. @xmath33 ) .",
    "the general lagrangian for the @xmath5 susy quantum mechanical model can be written , in terms of @xmath34 and @xmath35 , as ( see , e.g. @xcite for details ) @xmath36,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the following supercovariant derivatives @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the superpotential which is an arbitrary function of the supervariable @xmath6 .",
    "one can expand the above superpotential @xmath41 , by taylor expansion , around the ordinary space variable @xmath42 , as follows : @xmath43 we note that there will be no further higher order terms in the above expansion . finally , performing the proper grassmannian integration in ( 6 ) , we obtain the following physical lagrangian for the @xmath5 susy model : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is an arbitrary superpotential and its first- and second - order derivatives are : @xmath46 @xmath47",
    ". the above lagrangian can be simplified , modulo a total derivative , as : @xmath48 because of the fact that @xmath49 .",
    "we shall focus on the above lagrangian ( 10 ) for our further discussions ( in the rest of our discussions ) .",
    "the continuous susy transformations @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( cf . ( 5 ) ) can be re - expressed in terms of the fermionic @xmath50 symmetry transformations if we identify @xmath51 and @xmath52 in explicit form , these transformations are @xmath53 we note that @xmath54 and @xmath55 are off - shell nilpotent of order two .",
    "in other words , we observe the validity of @xmath56 in their operator form where any equation of motion , emerging from ( 10 ) , is _ not _ used .",
    "the lagrangian ( 10 ) transforms , under infinitesimal continuous transformations @xmath54 and @xmath55 , as @xmath57 , \\quad   s_2 l = \\frac{d}{dt}\\big[i\\,\\bar \\psi\\ , \\big(\\dot x - i\\,a\\big ) + \\bar \\psi\\ , w ' \\big].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this observation establishes that the action integral @xmath58 remains invariant under the continuous susy transformations @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "one of the key ingredients of a @xmath5 susy theory is the fact that two successive susy transformations must generate the spacetime translation in a given dimension of spacetime . in our one - dimensional case",
    ", we have the following relationship for the generic variable @xmath59 , namely ; @xmath60 thus , modulo @xmath61 factor , we have the time translation for a variable if we apply the two successive susy continuous symmetry transformations .",
    "in other words , we have the following symmetry transformation : @xmath62 it is obvious , at this juncture , that we have _ three _ standard continuous symmetry transformations in the theory .",
    "two of them are fermionic @xmath63 and one of them @xmath64 is bosonic .",
    "the latter is obtained from the anticommutator between the above fermionic symmetry transformations ( i.e. @xmath65 ) .    by exploiting the standard techniques of noether theorem",
    ", one can compute the conserved charges , corresponding to the above continuous symmetry transformations .",
    "the expressions , for the complete set of these charges , are @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the hamiltonian of the theory and @xmath68 is the momentum w.r.t .",
    "the conservation of the above charges ( i.e. @xmath69 ) can be proven by exploiting the following euler - lagrange equations of motion : @xmath70 which emerge from the lagrangian ( 10 ) of the theory . the other way of proving the conservation law is to exploit the canonical ( anti)commutators from the lagrangian ( 10 ) and check that the commutators @xmath71 = 0,\\ ;   [ h , \\ ;",
    "\\bar q ] = 0 $ ] and @xmath72 = 0 $ ] are trivially satisfied . from the heisenberg s equation of motion",
    ", this will , ultimately , imply the conservation law ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "we focus here on a set of discrete symmetries of the lagrangian ( 10 ) for our present general @xmath5 susy model of qm . we observe that under the following discrete transformations @xmath74 the lagrangian ( 10 ) remains invariant .",
    "it is to be noted that , in the above , we have primarily _ two _ discrete symmetry transformations for the lagrangian ( 10 ) where @xmath75 means @xmath76 and @xmath77 explicitly implies @xmath78 . as a consequence , the first derivative on the potential function @xmath79 is _ even _ under the parity transformation ( i.e. @xmath80 ) .",
    "we note further that there is a parity symmetry in the theory but there is _ no _ non - trivial time - reversal symmetry ( as @xmath81 ) .",
    "it is to be emphasized that here the prime on @xmath82 does not mean the space derivative .",
    "rather , the prime here corresponds to an internal discrete transformation like : @xmath83 @xmath84 .",
    "we repeat that there are two hidden symmetries ( @xmath85 ) in the above discrete symmetry transformations",
    ".    one can invoke the above cited time - reversal symmetry in the theory by checking that the following discrete transformations : @xmath86 also leave the lagrangian invariant ( i.e. @xmath87 ) .",
    "we explicitly mean , by the above transformations , the following @xmath88 similarly , the other transformations can be interpreted .",
    "thus , we figure out that there are parity and time - reversal symmetries _ together _ in ( 18 ) .    there is yet another discrete symmetry in the theory which , as we shall see later on , plays a crucial role in our further discussions",
    ". the following discrete symmetry transformations @xmath89 leave the lagrangian of our theory , yet again , invariant ( i.e. @xmath87 ) .",
    "thus , we lay emphasis on the fact that we have parity as well as time - reversal symmetry in the theory . the key difference between ( 18 ) and ( 20 )",
    "is associated with the transformations of the fermionic variables @xmath90 and @xmath91 under the time - reversal symmetry transformations @xmath92 .",
    "whereas in ( 18 ) , there is an @xmath93 factor in the transformations of the above variables , there is no @xmath93 factor in the latter transformations . at the level of signatures , too , there is a difference between the two transformations if we take a close look at them .",
    "we wrap up this section with the remark that we have listed _ only _ three types of discrete symmetries in the above .",
    "however , in principle , there might be existence of more such symmetries .",
    "we shall see later , in our forthcoming sections , that the discrete symmetry transformation ( 20 ) would play a very crucial role in our present endeavour of establishing a connection between the symmetries and the cohomological operators and it would also allow only susy potentials that are _ even _ under parity ( i.e. @xmath94 ) .",
    "the latter correspond to the square integrable eigenfunctions for susy qm @xcite .",
    "we further note that , in all our three discrete symmetries ( cf .",
    "( 17 ) , ( 18 ) , ( 20 ) ) , the fermionic variable @xmath82 transforms to @xmath95 and vice - versa .",
    "thus , at present stage , these variables are ` dual ' to each - other .",
    "we shall see the consequences of this observation , later on , when we shall focus more on the presence of the duality transformations .",
    "the continuous symmetry transformations @xmath96 and @xmath97 ( cf . ( 11 ) , ( 13 ) ) , in their operator form , obey the following algebraic structure : @xmath98 = 0 , \\qquad [ s_w,\\ ; s_2 ] = 0 , \\qquad s_w = ( s_1 + s_2)^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this algebraic structure is exactly same as the algebra of de rham cohomological operators @xmath99 of differential geometry @xcite where @xmath100 are the ( co-)exterior derivatives and @xmath101 is the laplacian operator . in explicit form ,",

    ". however , there are other decisive properties that are _ also _ associated with @xmath103 .",
    "these properties have to be captured in the language of symmetry transformations of the lagrangian if we wish to establish a _",
    "perfect _ analogy between the cohomological operators and symmetries .",
    "for instance , first of all , we know that the nilpotent @xmath105 ( co-)exterior derivatives @xmath106 are connected with each - other by the hodge duality ( @xmath107 ) operation defined on a given manifold . this important relationship is mathematically expressed as follows : @xmath108 where @xmath109 signs are determined by the inner product of @xmath110-forms in a given dimension of the manifold without a boundary . for an even - dimensional manifold @xmath111 and , for the odd - dimensional manifold , the signatures are decided by the degree of the forms , involved in the inner product , on that particular _",
    "odd_-dimensional manifold ( see , e.g. @xcite for more details ) .    within the realm of theoretical physics , the relationships ( 23 )",
    "are expressed in the language of symmetry properties @xcite .",
    "it can be seen that the interplay of the continuous and discrete symmetry transformations ( cf .",
    "3 and 4 ) leads to a relationship that is exactly similar in form as ( 23 ) .",
    "for instance , we have the validity of the following relationship for a given generic variable @xmath59 of the lagrangian ( 10 ) , namely ; @xmath112 where @xmath107 is the discrete symmetry transformations of sect .",
    "4 . the @xmath109 signs in ( 23 )",
    "are dictated by two successive operations of the discrete symmetry transformations on the generic variable @xmath59 ( see , e.g. @xcite for details ) : @xmath113 furthermore , for our present model , there exists an inverse relationship ( i.e. @xmath114 ) corresponding to the relationship given in ( 24 ) .    in view of the sacrosanct statements , made above about the duality - invariant theory ,",
    "let us study the sanctity of the discrete symmetries ( 17 ) , ( 18 ) and ( 20 ) .",
    "in the case of ( 17 ) , it can be checked that @xmath115 for @xmath116 @xmath117 .",
    "as it turns out , it can be explicitly verified that the relationships @xmath118 ( and/or @xmath119 ) are _ not _ satisfied .",
    "physically , too , it is _ not _ allowed ( see , e.g. @xcite ) because it corresponds to the superpotentials that are _ odd _ under parity ( i.e. @xmath120 ) .",
    "similarly , in the case of ( 18 ) , we check that @xmath121 where @xmath122 and @xmath123 for @xmath124 .",
    "here we have taken the generic variable @xmath125 .",
    "it is interesting to point out that the relations @xmath126 ( or its inverse @xmath127 ) are _ not _ obeyed .",
    "in addition , the relations @xmath128 ( or its inverse @xmath129 ) are also _ not _",
    "satisfied for the transformations ( 18 ) .",
    "thus , we shall discard both these sets of discrete symmetry transformations as they do not obey the sanctity of the strictures laid down by the rules of a duality invariant physical theory ( see , e.g. @xcite for details ) .",
    "now let us concentrate on the discrete symmetry transformations ( 20 ) with the upper signature ( i.e. @xmath130 ) .",
    "it can be checked explicitly that @xmath131 with these inputs , we readily verify ( with @xmath132 ) that @xmath133 thus , we conclude that the discrete transformations ( 20 ) , with the upper signature , are physically well - defined transformations that correspond to the hodge duality @xmath134 operation of differential geometry as the relations ( 27 ) provide a physical realization of the relationship @xmath135 between the ( co-)exterior derivatives ( of differential geometry ) in terms of symmetries .",
    "we close this section with the remark that the lower signature of the discrete symmetry transformations ( 20 ) _ does not _",
    "lead to the correct relationships @xmath136 as well as @xmath137 ( and their corresponding reverse relations ) .",
    "unique _ set of discrete symmetry transformations for our duality invariant physical theory , namely ; @xmath138 is the one , we shall be concentrating on , for the rest of our discussions .",
    "first of all , we observe that under the above discrete symmetry transformations : @xmath139 where @xmath107 is nothing but the transformations ( 28 ) .",
    "we point out that the transformations : @xmath140 are analogous to the electromagnetic duality transformations for the source - free maxwell equations where @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "this is the reason that , at the end of sect .",
    "4 , we have claimed that the variables @xmath90 and @xmath143 are  dual \" to each - other because these variables distinguish the two susy nilpotent and conserved charges ( @xmath144 ) . the second point to be noted is the fact that the transformations ( 28 ) allow superpotentials that are _",
    "even _ under parity ( i.e. @xmath94 ) and these are the ones that are physically interesting ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "there is still _",
    "one _ issue which has _ not yet _ been settled as far as the perfect analogy between the de rham cohomological operators @xmath145 and the conserved charges @xmath146 is concerned . we know that the operation of @xmath147 on a differential form @xmath148 of degree @xmath149 raises it to a form @xmath150 of degree @xmath151 ( i.e. @xmath152 ) where @xmath153 on the contrary",
    ", the action of the co - exterior derivative on a form @xmath148 of degree @xmath149 lowers the degree of the form by one ( i.e. @xmath154 ) where @xmath155 due to @xmath156 , it is clear that the laplacian operator @xmath101 does not affect the degree of a form on which it operates ( i.e. @xmath157 ) ( see . e.g. @xcite ) .    to capture the above properties , in the language of symmetry generators , we note the following straightforward algebra : @xmath158 = + \\,q\\ , h , \\qquad \\big[q\\,\\bar q , \\ ; \\bar q\\big ] = - \\,h\\,\\bar q,\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\big[\\bar q\\,q , \\ ; q\\big ] = -\\,h\\,q , \\qquad \\big[\\bar q\\,q , \\ ;   \\bar q\\big ] = + \\,\\bar q\\ , h.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is to be emphasized that we have normalized the expressions for the supercharges @xmath159 with some constant factors so that the basic susy algebra : @xmath160 = [ h,\\ , \\bar q ] = 0 $ ] is satisfied .",
    "we point out the fact that @xmath161 = 0 $ ] and @xmath162 = 0 $ ] imply that @xmath163 .",
    "the latter relations lead to : @xmath164 @xmath165 if the inverse of the hamiltonian exists . since we are focusing on the non - singular hamiltonian ( in the matrix form ) , we presume that the casimir operator @xmath67 has its well - defined inverse",
    ". the latter , too , would be the casimir operator for the whole algebra ( i , e .",
    "@xmath166 ) . as a consequence",
    ", we have an algebraically suitable form of ( 30 ) , as follows @xmath167 = + \\ , q , \\qquad",

    "it is straightforward to check that @xmath171 the above equation establishes the fact that the states @xmath172 @xmath173 and @xmath174 have the eigenvalues @xmath175 , respectively .",
    "thus , if we identify the eigenvalue @xmath110 with the degree of a form , then , it is clear that the following mapping between the conserved charges and cohomological operators of differential geometry emerge , namely ; @xmath176 we point out that the property of ( lowering)raising of a given differential form by the operations of the ( co-)exterior derivatives is also captured in the language of the conserved charges when we identify the eigenvalue of the operator @xmath169 with the degree of a given differential form .",

    "thus , as far as the lowering and raising property of @xmath177 is concerned , we have the following mapping between the conserved charges @xmath178 and the cohomological operators : @xmath186 thus , ultimately , we conclude that if the degree of a given form is identified with the eigenvalue of a given state ( in the quantum hilbert space ) corresponding to the operator @xmath187 , then , the consequences ensuing from the operation of the set of charges @xmath188 is identical to the operation of the set @xmath177 on the degree of a given form . this is why the mapping ( 36 ) is correct .",

    "furthermore , the correct transformations of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , under the discrete symmetry transformations , also shed light on the correctness of a chosen set of discrete symmetry transformations for our present susy quantum mechanical theory .",
    "it would be very nice endeavour to exploit our present observations in the context of the study of @xmath5 susy ( non-)abelian gauge theories ( in any arbitrary dimension of spacetime ) where there is a possibility of the appearance of cohomological structure .",
    "such theories might be shown to be the perfect models for the hodge theory as well as new models for tfts .",
    "the latter are expected to turn out to be different from the witten - type tfts @xcite as well as schwarz - type tfts @xcite .",
    "we have performed such kind of study in the case of _ usual _",
    "2d ( non-)abelian gauge theories ( see , e.g. @xcite ) where the full strength of the symmetries of the hodge theory has been exploited in its full blaze of glory .",
    "our work can be possibly extended to contain exotic discrete symmetries that have been mentioned in @xcite .",
    "this exercise will definitely enrich the mathematical structure of our present analysis where the existence of discrete symmetries plays an important role .",
    "furthermore , we plan to explore the possibility of existence of the cohomological structure in the @xmath199 susy quantum mechanical theories @xcite .",
    "in fact , we expect many possibilities of the physical realizations of the cohomological operators in this case .",
    "our present work can also be extended to higher dimensional ( e.g. 2d and 3d ) susy quantum mechanical models following the work done in @xcite .",
    "we are devoting time on the above cited problems and our results would be reported , later on , in our future publications @xcite .",

    "the whole of algebraic structures in sect .",
    "6 are based on the basic @xmath5 susy algebra @xmath200 = [ h , \\;\\bar q ] = 0 $ ] which is satisfied on the _ on - shell_. to corroborate this statement , first of all , auxiliary variable @xmath201 in the lagrangian ( 10 ) is replaced by @xmath202 due to the equation of motion @xmath203 ( which emerges from ( 10 ) itself ) .",
    "furthermore , the symmetry transformations @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( cf . ( 11 ) ) are modified a bit by the overall constant factors .",
    "thus , we have the following different looking lagrangian @xmath204 which remains invariant under the following transformations @xmath205 the above transformations are nilpotent of order two ( i.e. @xmath206 ) only when the equations of motion @xmath207 are used .",
    "it can be checked that @xmath208 and @xmath209 .",
    "hence , the action integral @xmath210 remains invariant under @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the conserved noether charges , that emerge corresponding to ( a.2 ) , are @xmath211 these charges are same as quoted in ( 15 ) except the fact that @xmath201 has been replaced by @xmath202 ( due to the equation of motion from the lagrangian ( 10 ) ) and the constant factors @xmath212 have been included for the algebraic convenience . it can be readily checked that the above charges are the generator for the transformations ( a.2 ) because we have the following relationships : @xmath213_\\pm , \\qquad \\quad",
    "s_2 \\phi = \\pm\\,i\\ , \\big[\\phi , \\ ; \\bar q\\big]_\\pm , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the generic variable @xmath59 corresponds to the variables @xmath214 and the subscripts @xmath109 on square brackets stand for the ( anti)commutator depending on the generic variable @xmath59 being ( fermionic)bosonic in nature .",
    "the @xmath109 signs , in front of the brackets , are _ also _ chosen judiciously ( see , e.g. @xcite for details ) .",
    "the structure of the specific @xmath5 susy algebra now follows when we exploit the basic relationship ( a.4 ) . in other words ,",
    "we observe the following @xmath215 where @xmath67 is the hamiltonian ( corresponding to the lagrangian ( a.1 ) ) . the explicit form of @xmath67 can be mathematically expressed as : @xmath216 where @xmath68 is the momentum corresponding to the variable @xmath42 .",
    "we also lay emphasis on the fact that we have exploited the inputs from equations of motion @xmath217 in the derivation of @xmath67 from the legendre transformation @xmath218 where @xmath219 and @xmath220 .",
    "the derivation of specific @xmath5 susy algebra ( cf .",

    "furthermore , it may be trivially noted that , for the choices @xmath222 and @xmath223 in the lagrangian ( a.1 ) , we obtain the lagrangians for the susy harmonic oscillator and its generalization in @xcite . for the description of the motion of a charged particle in the @xmath224 plane under the influence of a magnetic field along @xmath225-direction",
