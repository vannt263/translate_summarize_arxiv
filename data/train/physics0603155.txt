    "disperse systems , such as clouds of small particles suspended in liquid or gas are widespread in natural environment as well as in various fields of human activity . due to admixture ,",
    "such systems demonstrate intriguing physical effects , which can not occur in homogeneous media .",
    "understanding of the mechanisms governing the behavior of particles in fluid flows is of crucial importance both for fundamental studies and practical applications .",
    "advection of particles in fluid flows is currently investigated in several disciplines . in chemistry",
    "( see , for example , refs .  ) , this problem is essential in lowering fuel consumption during combustion of liquid fuels . in biology ,",
    "recent developments have put forth a number of fascinating problems concerning transport of microorganisms in aqueous medium.@xcite a typical example are algae , transported by ocean flows .",
    "these algae contribute essentially to the absorption of @xmath0 in oceans , which is closely related to the problem of climate change . in rapidly developing microfluidics ,",
    "advection of particles has been the focus of close attention due to a need of finding effective mechanisms of particle mixing.@xcite in fluid mechanics light - scattering particles of dust are widely used for visualization of flows . besides , it is also important to know how particles influence the flow . investigation of a spread of fine - dispersed impurities in the atmosphere and oceans is tightly related to the problem of environmental protection .",
    "these numerous applications have motivated the unflagging interest in the fundamental problems of particle advection in fluids .",
    "the behavior of a small single particle in isothermal fluid flows has been the subject of a great deal of study ( see , for example , the monograph @xcite and the reviews @xcite ) . in particular , the equation of motion for a small single particle in a nonuniform unsteady flow",
    "was discussed by maxey and riley.@xcite however , the fact that this equation takes into account the integral basset force essentially complicates its solution .",
    "therefore in most cases the problem has been solved in terms of asymptotic theoretical models .",
    "stommel @xcite studied sedimentation of particles in a cellular fluid flow in terms of weak inertia approximation .",
    "to our knowledge this was the first paper that developed a simple description of capture of small solid particles by a fluid flow .",
    "it was shown , that when the ascending flow is rather intensive , some particles are involved in a vortex motion and remain suspended .",
    "recently , capture of particles has been observed in a cellular convective flow.@xcite qualitatively similar behavior is shown by granular media in the ascending air flow under gravity : at a certain velocity of air flow the granular matter is liquidized.@xcite the problem of sedimentation of small heavy particles has been generalized for the case of a random flow ( see ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "however , a backward effect of the particles on a fluid flow was not considered .",
    "a number of theoretical and experimental studies are devoted to the problem of particle accumulation in fluid flows  the effect , which is essential due to a difference in the inertial properties of the phases when gravity is insignificant.@xcite the situation , when both gravity and inertia contribute to the particle dynamics , has been studied in papers.@xcite the authors of papers @xcite have investigated the influence of the basset history force on the particle motion .",
    "another problem that has been intensively studied for many years is the stability of laminar isothermal flows carrying small solid particles .",
    "first papers @xcite were devoted to the stability of the particulate poiseuille flow .",
    "this problem has been generalized in the series of papers.@xcite the stability of the couette flow was considered in ref .  .",
    "a general result of these investigations is that stability of a dusty flow qualitatively depends on the size of particles : relatively small particles destabilize the flow , whereas the particles of a larger size make the flow more stable .",
    "the relaxation time of small particles is short , therefore such particles move actually with the velocity of the fluid .",
    "the presence of particles results in renormalization of the media density .",
    "a larger efficient density is equivalent to a higher fluid velocity , which leads to destabilization . on the contrary ,",
    "the relaxation time of large particles is long .",
    "such particles are too inert to respond to rapid velocity variations of the carrying fluid and hence , large particles damp the fluid velocity perturbations .    the collective behavior of particles in laminar nonisothermal flows is much less studied .",
    "moreover , the problem of interaction of the particles with convective flows is not completely understood yet .",
    "the exceptions are the works , concerning the influence of settling particles on the stability of convective flows.@xcite    it is known , that particles of dust are widely used for visualization of flows in the experiments on thermal buoyancy convection .",
    "it is conventionally assumed that , if the mass concentration of particles is small , their backward influence on the convective flow is negligible .",
    "however , this is not always true .",
    "the point is that buoyancy convective flow itself is caused by small variations of density related to nonisothermality of a medium .",
    "if density variations due to nonuniformity of the particle distribution are of the same order of magnitude as those due to nonisothermality , one should no longer ignore the influence of particles on the flow . for small particle concentration this effect",
    "is intuitively believed to be pronounced if the density of particles and the density of the carrier fluid differ enough .",
    "a typical example is solid particles suspended in a gaseous medium .",
    "however , we argue below that the effect is essential in more general case , when the densities of phases are different , but of the same order ( for example , in liquids laden with small solid particles ) . under gravity",
    "such particles tend to settle on the bottom of a container .",
    "two mechanisms hinder particles from settling down : the brownian motion of particles leading to their diffusion in a carrier fluid and the entrapment of particles by vortex fluid flows .",
    "the first mechanism operates also in a quiescent medium and leads to the boltzmann distribution of particles over a height .",
    "however , for particle sizes commonly used for flow visualization , an effective diffusion coefficient is so small that in the equilibrium state the particles are practically absent in most part of the volume .",
    "the second mechanism , which operates only if the maximal velocity of ascending flows exceeds the sedimentation velocity , is much more efficient .",
    "investigation of the capture effect and a backward influence of the particles on a flow is important not only for visualization problems but also for more fundamental aspects of environmental problems .",
    "the mechanism of particle capture discussed above is related to nonuniformity of the particle distribution over the volume .",
    "even if the initial distribution of particles is uniform , this nonuniformity arises by itself due to the particle sedimentation in the regions , where the flow is either descending or has small vertical velocities .",
    "if the vertical dimension of the container is large , the particle distribution in the most part of the container is nearly uniform for a long time . however , even in this case the particles can influence the flow , because their velocity differs from the velocity of the fluid due to sedimentation .",
    "thus , the particles can transfer the perturbations of temperature and vorticity and affect stability of a convective flow.@xcite    in the present paper , we study the capture of dust particles by convective flows .",
    "particularly , a backward effect of particles on the fluid flow is investigated in details . in sec .",
    "[ sec : theor_model ] , an appropriate theoretical model is developed as a generalization of the boussinesq approximation to a convective flow in a dusty medium . in sec .  [ sec : gen_consid ] , the obtained equations are used to make a general interpretation of the problem and to prove that the entrapped particles form a cloud of dust .",
    "section  [ sec : layer ] is devoted to consideration of a dusty medium in an infinite vertical layer .",
    "the existence of a steady state solution with particle distribution in the form a dust cloud is proved , and the stability of this state is investigated .",
    "consider the behavior of small solid particles , suspended in a nonisothermal fluid ( liquid or gas ) under gravity .",
    "on one hand , all particles are assumed to be monodisperse spheres of a radius @xmath1 , which is large enough to neglect particle diffusion . on the other hand , this size is supposed to be much smaller than the characteristic length scale @xmath2 of the flow . on a scale much greater than @xmath1 the particles are regarded as a continuous medium with the volume fraction @xmath3 ( the volume fraction of the fluid phase @xmath4 ) , where @xmath5 is the the number of particles per unit volume of the medium . since the actual volume concentration @xmath5 is proportional to @xmath6 and differs from the latter by a constant factor , in the following for the sake of simplicity @xmath6 will be called concentration .",
    "we suppose that the volume concentration of particles is small , so we can neglect interparticle interactions and interactions between the particles and walls of a container .",
    "it is also assumed that the carrier phase is incompressible and the solid particles can neither deform nor combine into agglomerates .",
    "moreover , the density of a solid phase is considered to be constant .",
    "the latter assumption implies that we neglect thermal expansion of the solid phase , which is perfectly valid in the dilute limit . after averaging over space",
    "the equations for mass , momentum and energy balance of both phases are written as follows : @xcite    [ ineqs - mass ] @xmath7    [ ineqs - mom ] @xmath8    [ ineqs - enrg ] @xmath9    where @xmath10 and @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , are the velocities and the temperatures of phases , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the pressure and the density of fluid , respectively ( hereafter , the subscript @xmath16 stands for the particle phase ) , @xmath17 is the unit vector of the axis @xmath18 , directed against gravity ; the shear rate tensor @xmath19 .",
    "the dimensionless variables have been introduced using the following units : the reference density of fluid @xmath20 for the densities of phases , the reference temperature difference @xmath21 for the temperatures , @xmath2 for the coordinates , @xmath22 for the time , @xmath23 for the velocities , @xmath24 for the pressure , where @xmath25 is the viscosity of fluid and @xmath26 .",
    "equations ( [ ineqs - mass])-([ineqs - enrg ] ) involve the following dimensionless parameters : the galilei number @xmath27 , the prandtl number @xmath28 , the ratio of densities of phases @xmath29 , the ratio of the specific heats of phases at constant pressure @xmath30 and the ratio of characteristic particle size to the flow length scale @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the thermal conductivity of fluid .",
    "we make a note of the distinction between the two lagrangian derivatives @xmath33 and @xmath34 , which are used to denote the time derivative associated with the motion of the fluid element and the element of a solid phase , respectively .    in the interphase interaction term",
    ", @xmath35 has the meaning of the force exerted by an unsteady nonuniform fluid on the solid particle .",
    "this force can be written as @xcite @xmath36 where the relative velocity of phases @xmath37 is introduced .",
    "the first two terms in ( [ ref11 - 3 ] ) , correspond to contributions to the force exerted on the particle by undisturbed fluid flow due to gravity and pressure gradient . in the approximation of",
    "undisturbed flow these terms coincide with the archemedian force .",
    "generally , the particle during its motion , disturbs the flow , the effect being taken into account by the next three terms in ( [ ref11 - 3 ] ) : the stokes viscous drag , the basset history force , caused by unsteadiness of a viscous boundary layer around a particle , and the added mass force , allowing for the inertia of the surrounding fluid .",
    "we do not consider the effects that can be initiated by rotation of particles .",
    "particularly , the magnus force is not taken into account in ( [ ref11 - 3 ] ) .",
    "this assumption holds only in the case when the particle response time @xmath38 is much less than the characteristic hydrodynamic time scale @xmath22 .",
    "therefore the stokes number , corresponding to a ratio of these time scales , is assumed to be small : @xmath39 however , we assume the parameter @xmath40 to be finite and do not restrict our theory to the limiting case of dusty media ( @xmath41 ) , cf",
    "further , we do not explicitly take into account einstein s correction term to the viscosity of fluid due to solid admixture , which is inessential in the dilute limit .",
    "the equation of state used here is typical for thermal buoyancy convection .",
    "we consider weak convection , when the variations of density due to nonisothermality of a fluid are small . assuming that the fluid density is a function of only temperature @xmath42 , we expand it into a taylor series near its reference value @xmath20 at the temperature value @xmath43 and restrict ourselves to a linear approximation @xmath44 where temperature @xmath12 is measured from the value @xmath43",
    ", @xmath45 is the thermal expansion coefficient .",
    "let us consider a fluid laden with small solid particles and prove that the initial two - phase theoretical model ( [ ineqs - mass])-([ref11 - 3 ] ) can be simplified .",
    "we assume that the mass concentration of particles @xmath46 is comparable with the relative variations of the fluid density due to nonisothermality .",
    "bearing in mind that the particle concentration @xmath6 , the nonisothermality @xmath47 , and the relative size of particles @xmath48 are small we retain only the leading terms in the momentum equations ( [ ineqs - mom ] ) . as a result",
    "we conclude that in the basic state the pressure distribution is hydrostatic , and obtain a relation between the velocities of phases : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the dimensionless sedimentation velocity .",
    "equation ( [ ref12 - 2 ] ) indicates that in the accepted approximation the particle velocity equals the velocity of the fluid plus the constant sedimentation velocity .",
    "taking into account ( [ ref12 - 2 ] ) , we obtain in the next order the momentum equation of the fluid @xmath51 { \\rm ga } { \\bf e}_{z},\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the convective addition to the hydrostatic pressure .",
    "following the idea of the boussinesq approximation we can state that at large values of the galilei number and small density inhomogeneities the density of the medium will be constant everywhere except for the buoyancy force , where these small density variations are multiplied by @xmath53 .",
    "so , we introduce the thermal grashof number @xmath54 and its concentration analog @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the characteristic value of the particle concentration . from the energy balance equation ( [ ineqs - enrg - b ] )",
    "we obtain in the leading order : @xmath57 .",
    "we restrict our consideration to this approximation .",
    "this implies that for small particles the time to equilibrate the phase temperature is much less than the viscous hydrodynamic time scale .",
    "the energy equation for the fluid phase is then obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ ineqs - enrg ] ) . taking into account the mass balance equations for fluid and particles ( [ ineqs - mass ] ) we arrive at a complete set of equations describing thermal buoyancy convection in a nonisothermal fluid laden with particles : @xmath58    where the prime for @xmath14 is omitted , and the concentration is normalized by @xmath59 .",
    "the set of equations ( [ ref12 - 7a])-([ref12 - 7d ] ) is reminiscent of equations for thermosolutal convection .",
    "however , there are two essential differences : first , we have neglected the diffusion of particles , second , we have taken into account the finite sedimentation velocity .",
    "the developed model is quite general and can be applied to dusty media , aerosols , liquids laden with small solid particles , and biological species in aqueous media .",
    "consider the behavior of a dusty medium in a closed cavity of an arbitrary shape heated from the sidewalls .",
    "it is assumed that at the initial time the dust is uniformly distributed all over the volume and at a later time no new particles enter the cavity but the existing particles may settle to the bottom .",
    "we also assume that the particles that have settled on the bottom are not carried back into the flow , but stick to the bottom .",
    "the question arises as to whether all particles should eventually settle on the bottom or there may occur a situation when some particles will be entrapped by the flow and stay in a suspended state for infinitely long time .    obviously , in the absence of heating ( @xmath60 ) and any initial perturbations",
    ", all particles will eventually sink down on the bottom for a time of order @xmath61 , which corresponds to the following solution of the equations ( [ ref12 - 7a])-([ref12 - 7d ] ) : @xmath62    where @xmath63 .",
    "so , initial distribution of particles ensures sedimentation without distortion of the interface between a pure fluid and suspension .    in order to simplify further argumentation",
    ", we will measure @xmath18 from the lowest point of the cavity .",
    "it can be understood through insight that inducing of initial perturbations of concentration and velocity does not change the situation : finally all perturbations will be damped and all the particles will settle on the bottom . to demonstrate this",
    "let us consider the evolution of the total energy of the system @xmath64 : @xmath65    using ( [ ref12 - 7a])-([ref12 - 7d ] ) we obtain for the rate of the energy change @xmath66    where @xmath67 is the surface bounding the volume @xmath68 , @xmath69 is the external vector normal to @xmath67 . to obtain eq .",

    "moreover it can be equal to zero only in the case of a quiescent fluid in the absence of the particles at the walls .",
    "this proves that the energy @xmath64 can only decrease . on the other hand ,",
    "as can be seen from ( [ ref2 - 2 ] ) , @xmath73 , i.e. it is bounded from below .",
    "hence , the final state is that , at which the right - hand side in ( [ ref2 - 3 ] ) turns to zero , i.e. when the fluid becomes completely free of the particles and all fluid flows cease .",
    "the situation radically changes if there is a permanent external source that makes fluid move . in the present work ,",
    "the source of this kind is side heating of the wall , generating a vortex convective flow in a cavity .",
    "naturally , in this case , the areas near the walls will finally be free of particles .",
    "indeed , as it follows from eq .",
    "( [ ref12 - 7c ] ) @xmath74    the total amount of the dust in the cavity decreases until @xmath6 turns to zero everywhere near the boundaries .",
    "it does not mean , however , that the bulk of the fluid will be completely free of particles .",
    "if in some part of the cavity the velocity of the ascending fluid @xmath75 exceeds the sedimentation velocity @xmath76 , we can expect the capture of the particles .",
    "the condition @xmath77 is the necessary condition for capture but it is not a sufficient one .",
    "indeed , we can easily imagine the flow pattern with the streamlines of particles shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : capt_sketch](a ) : despite the existence of regions with ascending motion of particles , all streamlines end at the lower boundary .        on the other hand",

    "the addition to the velocity of particle due to purely inertial drift @xmath90 is given @xcite by the term @xmath91 . since the intensity of thermal convection",

    "we obtain the inertial time scale @xmath95 ( @xmath96 , @xmath97 ) .",

    "different flow patterns can arise at the same values of the governing parameters : the modes , in which a comparatively small dust cloud strongly suppresses the ascending flow and the modes developing at comparatively large cloud when the density inhomogeneities are low and the suppression effect is insignificant .    the linear stability of the basic steady state in the form of a dust cloud in an infinite layer , heated from sidewalls , has been investigated .",
    "it is shown , that in a relatively narrow range of the values of governing parameters this state is stable .",
    "based on the results of the stability analysis , we can infer that in the typical case of a closed cavity the steady state with a relatively large dust cloud is most likely to have a larger range of stability . in the case of an infinite layer",
    "such a steady state is broken by long wavelength perturbations .",
    "obviously , such perturbations can not arise in a closed container of a finite size .",
    "the performed investigation demonstrates that the described effects of two - way interaction of fluid and particles can exist in natural environment or be realized experimentally .",
    "the values of the sedimentation parameter @xmath76 of order @xmath131 , used in the linear stability analysis , correspond , for example , to the case of rather fine particles of dust with @xmath316 , suspended under gravity in a gaseous medium filling a laboratory - scale container @xmath317 ( @xmath318 , @xmath319 , @xmath320 ) .",
    "the developed theory is quite general and can be applied to describe similar effects not only in dusty media , but also in aerosols , liquids laden with small solid particles , and biological species in aqueous media .",
