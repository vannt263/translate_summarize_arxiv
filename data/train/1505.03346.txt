    "its use has also led to the derivation of numerous tractable analytic expressions , while its computational realization is rather straightforward since it is included as a built - in function in the most popular software packages @xcite .    however , it is widely known that the derivation of tractable analytic expressions in natural sciences and engineering can be rather laborious and cumbersome , if not impossible , as integrals that involve combinations of elementary and special functions are often required to be evaluated analytically @xcite , and the references therein .",
    "this is also the case when the marcum @xmath0function is involved in integrands along with exponential and arbitrary power terms .",
    "a general form of such an integral is the following : @xmath3 which can be equivalently expressed as @xmath4 the integrals in and are encountered in various applications relating to wireless communications , such as in the analysis of multichannel diversity systems with non - coherent and differentially coherent detection and in sensing of unknown signals in the context of cognitive radio and radar systems @xcite and the references therein .",
    "based on this , a recursive formula restricted to only integer values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 was reported in @xcite while an infinite series representation for the case that @xmath5 is arbitrary and @xmath6 is positive integer was recently reported in @xcite",
