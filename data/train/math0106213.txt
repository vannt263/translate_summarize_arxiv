    "this paper is concerned with a certain isomorphic copy of the ring @xmath0 of symmetric functions , namely the ring of isobaric polynomials @xmath1 , where the isomorphism is given by a polynomial map involving the elementary symmetric functions .",
    "the ring will be taken to be either the integers @xmath2 or the rationals @xmath3 , and the image of a symmetric polynomial under the isomorphism mentioned above will be called an isobaric reflect .",
    "an isobaric polynomial is one of the form @xmath4 , where @xmath5 are integers with @xmath6 .",
    "thus such a polynomial can be represented as a polynomial in the young diagrams of @xmath7 , where the monomial is an encoding of the partition of @xmath7 . as for the ring of symmetric polynomials",
    ", we can allow either a finite number @xmath8 of variables or we can work in @xmath9 with infinitely many variables .",
    "families of isobaric polynomials occur in many contexts in mathematics . in",
    "@xcite it was shown that the reflects of the complete symmetric polynomials ( csp ) determine the multiplicative arithmetic functions locally . in  @xcite it was shown that the reflects of the power sum symmetric polynomials ( psp ) determine the lattice of root fields of quadratic extensions .",
    "properties of these two sequences of polynomials were discussed in  @xcite where the csp - reflects are called generalized fibbonacci polynomials ( gfp ) , and the psp - reflects are called the generalized lucas polynomials ( glp ) . recall that the complete symmetric polynomials form a @xmath2-basis for the symmetric polynomials as do the elementary symmetric polynomials ( esp ) , while the power symmetric polynomials ( psps ) form a @xmath3-basis .",
    "the analogues of these facts carries over to the isobaric polynomial algebras by way of a canonical isomorphism of the ring @xmath10 to the ring @xmath1 denoted by @xmath11 .",
    "in fact , this isomorphism is just the one that takes symmetric functions on @xmath8 variables , written in terms of elementary symmetric polynomials , and rewrites each elementary polynomial @xmath12 as @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14    it is well - known that the schur symmetric polynomials ( ssp ) determine the complex character table of the finite symmetric groups using the littlewood - richardson rule and the frobenius character theorem .",
    "thus the ssps for a given @xmath7 can be regarded as an encoding of the complex character table of @xmath15 .",
    "the frobenius character theorem can be written in terms of isobaric polynomials , namely in terms of glps .",
    "using this fact , the complex characters of @xmath15 can be easily calculated from the isobaric reflects of the ssp@xmath16 , the schur polynomials , for a given @xmath7 .",
    "the families gfp and glp have the additional useful property that each satisfies recursion relations ( newton identities ) .",
    "it will turn out that @xmath1 contains a large class of recursively defined families ( theorem  [ free ] ) .",
    "these are the families of what we have called _ weighted isobaric polynomials _ ( wips ) , and they are the main subject of this paper .",
    "such polynomials are determined by assigning a weight to each of the variables @xmath17 , i.e. by assigning a weight vector to the set of variables @xmath18 .",
    "such families will be called weighted isobaric families .",
    "it turns out that the union of all such families does not exhaust the ring of isobaric polynomials .",
    "in fact , in this paper we show that among the schur polynomials , exactly those schur reflects which represent hook ( young ) diagrams can belong to a sequence of weighted isobaric polynomials ( theorem  [ rechooks ] and theorem  [ rechooks2 ] ) .",
    "families of wips , multi - indexed by their weights , form in a natural way a free abelian group induced by addition of their weight vectors ( theorem  [ free ] ) .",
    "the weighted families gfp and glp , i.e. the csp and psp reflects , are the weighted families determined by weight vectors @xmath19 in the case of gfp , and @xmath20 in the case of glp .",
    "the schur - hook reflects have weight vectors of the form @xmath21 ( theorem  [ hook ] ) .",
    "the coefficients of the monomials in an isobaric polynomial are uniquely determined by the exponents of the variables and the weight vector of the family ( theorem  [ coeffthm ] ) . in order to prove theorem  [ coeffthm ] we use the fact that each monomial determines a lattice whose nodes are the young diagrams of the monomial obtained by derivation . however , this lattice is not the well - known young s lattice , but instead it is a lattice partially ordered by the pointwise inequality of the exponents of the constituent nodes .",
    "it assumes a major role in this paper in understanding the construction of the wips and certain other structures associated to them .",
    "in 1988 , carrol and gioia  @xcite gave a numerical description of the @xmath22-th roots ( @xmath23 ) of the multiplicative arithmetical functions in the group of units of the ring of arithmetical functions .",
    "in  @xcite it was shown that under convolution , these functions form a free abelian group generated by the completely multiplicative functions , as mentioned above ; it was also shown in that paper that the gfps give a generic set of generating functions for this group of arithmetic functions in the following sense : each multiplicative function in the core group of the group of units of a multiplicative arithmetic function together with its convolution inverse is uniquely determined locally by a monic polynomial ( over the complex fields ) , the generating polynomial . what is called a negative element",
    "is a multiplicative function whose local values are just the coefficients of this generating polynomial , while the inverse of this negative core function , a positive element , is a multiplicative function whose local values are given by evaluating the series of gfps truncated at the degree of the generating polynomial at these coefficients . in section 4",
    ", we produce a sequence of isobaric polynomials which are the @xmath22-th roots for any @xmath24 of the generic generating functions for these roots , that is , the @xmath22-th roots of the generalized fibonacci and lucas polynomials ( the csp and psp reflects ) .",
    "thus , we have embedded the core group into its divisible closure .",
    "moreover , our construction is more far - reaching than this .",
    "it produces a set of @xmath22-th roots with respect to a product induced by convolution , which we have called the level product ( so - called because it acts on polynomials of the same level and conserves level ) for every isobaric polynomial in any weighted family ( theorem  [ hsum ] ) .",
    "theorem  [ hsum ] also implies that under the level product , an element has a level product inverse .",
    "it is not the case that the isobaric roots of weighted functions are necessarily weighted .",
    "however , they are determined by specifying a weight vector .",
    "the appropriate structure to look at here , then , is the ring generated by the level product .",
    "this is a graded ring @xmath25 containing wips .",
    "however , there is still more algebraic structure .",
    "since we have inversion under level - product , each weighted family and its divisible closure has the structure of the rationals .",
    "moreover , because of theorem  [ free ] each weighted family is acted on by translations , and so we finally have that all of this together with the derivation operation give a differential graded abelian group acted on by an affine group .",
    "a _ weighted isobaric polynomial ( wip ) _ is defined inductively in terms of a particular lattice which will now be described .",
    "the nodes of the lattice are the monomials @xmath26 , where @xmath27 with @xmath28 , for a fixed @xmath7 .",
    "we denote this by @xmath29 and by @xmath30 the sum @xmath31 . the relation @xmath32 imposes a lattice structure on the set of @xmath33 .",
    "the _ depth _ of a monomial in the lattice is @xmath34 , and its _ level _ is @xmath35 .",
    "let @xmath36 be the bottom element .",
    "we assign a weight vector @xmath37 to the variables @xmath38 , i.e. to each @xmath17 we assign @xmath39 as its coefficient .",
    "the weights are taken to be rational but they can belong to any ring @xmath40 .",
    "having done this , @xmath41 will be assigned the coefficient equal to the sum of the coefficients of all @xmath42 that have depth @xmath43 and for which @xmath44 .",
    "thus each monomial involving @xmath41 can be associated with a ( finite ) sublattice @xmath45 with top element @xmath41 , the lattice of all those monomials whose coefficients contribute to the coefficient of @xmath41 .",
    "for any two monomials there is a monomial whose lattice contains their lattices .",
    "note also that the lengths of all maximal chains of the sublattice @xmath46 with @xmath44 are the same and clearly equal to the corresponding _",
    "depth_.    the isobaric polynomial of level @xmath7 and weight @xmath47 is therefore @xmath48 .",
    "the lattice @xmath49 is        we can now state    [ coeffthm ] if @xmath47 is a weight vector , then the wip of degree @xmath7 has at most @xmath50 terms , where @xmath50 is the number of partitions of @xmath7 , and the coefficients are given by @xmath51    in particular , the coefficients of the families @xmath52 , the gfp and @xmath53 , the glp , are given by @xmath54 and @xmath55!}{\\prod_{j=1}^k(\\alpha_j)!}}$ ] , respectively , where the weight vector of the gfps is given by @xmath19 and the weight vector of the glps is given by @xmath20 .",
    "it is of interest that , when @xmath47 is an integer vector , the numbers @xmath56 are integers .",

    "* proof of theorem  [ coeffthm]*.    let @xmath57 with @xmath58 be a weight assignment to the indeterminates @xmath59 .",
    "this assignment , together with the inductive rule for determining the coefficient of a monomial in the lattice , will define a family of wips , denoted by @xmath60 or just @xmath61 .    to see that the coefficients are",
    "as stated in the theorem , we proceed by induction on the depth to compute the coefficient of @xmath62 , where @xmath63 .",

    "for example the first four of these in any sequence are of the form :    @xmath71 since all of the operations involved in computing the coefficients are ring operations , we have the following .",
    "if @xmath72 and @xmath47 are integer vectors , then @xmath56 is an integer .    for a weight @xmath47 with @xmath73 , for any @xmath74 , using the jacobian criterion we have that @xmath75 and thus the family @xmath76 consists of algebraically independent polynomials .",
    "this allow us to construct a new basis for @xmath1 for each such weight vector @xmath47 , whose elements are @xmath77    moreover , if @xmath78 and , @xmath79 then @xmath80 . if we define addition on these classes by @xmath81 we have    [ free ] @xmath82 is a free @xmath2-module under this operation .    * proof * first notice that @xmath83 if and only if @xmath84 , for by theorem  [ coeffthm ] this implies that @xmath85 , and this in turn implies , by taking different values for the @xmath72 s , that @xmath86",
    ". thus equality of families implies identity of weights .",
    "clearly the set of families is a @xmath2-module under the defined operation .",
    "since there is a homomorphic image of the @xmath2-module of families onto the @xmath2-module of integer weight vectors , the assertion follows .",
    "@xmath70 while the wips form a graded ( and , as we shall see , a differential graded ) ring , they are not closed under multiplication , so the best we can do is speak of the subring of @xmath1 generated by wips .",

    "denoting the schur polynomials by ssp , we want to consider the family of isobaric reflects of the ssp , the schur reflects . in this section",
    "we are interested in the question of which schur reflects can belong to a sequence of wips . more generally , of course , we want to know when any isobaric polynomial belongs to some wip sequence .",
    "we have solved the problem for schur reflects , but we still have no interesting criterion in the general case .    first , a look at the classical role that schur polynomials play from the point of view of reflects .",

    "this gives us a representation of the complex character table of @xmath15 in terms of psp reflects , the @xmath111 s .",
    "rewriting these polynomials in terms of the csps using , e.g. , theorem 3 of  @xcite gives a representation in terms of complete symmetric polynomials .",
