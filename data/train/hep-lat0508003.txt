    "there exist several equivalent representations of lattice gauge theories ( lgt ) .",
    "originally , lgt was formulated by k.  wilson in terms of group valued matrices on links as fundamental degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the partition function can be written as @xmath3 \\ } \\ , \\label{partfunc}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 $ ] is some gauge - invariant action whose naive continuum limit coincides with the yang - mills action .",
    "the integral in ( [ partfunc ] ) is calculated over the haar measure on the group at every link of the lattice .",
    "very popular in the context of abelian lgt is the dual representation which was constructed in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "extensions of dual formulations to non - abelian groups have been proposed only in the nineties in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the resulting dual representation appears to be a local theory of discrete variables which label the irreducible representations of the underlying gauge group and can be written solely in terms of group invariant objects like the @xmath5-symbols , etc .",
    "a closely related approach to the dual formulation is the so - called plaquette representation invented originally in the continuum theory by m.  halpern @xcite and extended to lattice models in @xcite . in this representation",
    "the plaquette matrices play the role of the dynamical degrees of freedom and satisfy certain constraints expressed through bianchi identities in every cube of the lattice .",
    "each representation has its own advantages and deficiencies .",
    "e.g. , the wilson formulation is well suited for monte - carlo simulations , while dual and plaquette representations are usually used for an analytical study of the models .",
    "in particular , duals of abelian @xmath0 lgt have been used to prove the existence of the deconfinement phase transition at zero temperature in four - dimensions ( @xmath6 ) @xcite and to prove confinement at all couplings in @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "also monte - carlo simulations proved to be very efficient in the dual of @xmath6 @xmath0 lgt @xcite .",
    "so far , however both dual and plaquette formulations have not been so popular in the case of non - abelian models , probably due to the complexity of these representations . for instance , the plaquette representation can hardly be used for monte - carlo computations due to a number of constraints on the plaquette matrices .",
    "let us remind the general form of the batrouni construction . in @xcite",
    "the plaquette representation was constructed in the maximal axial gauge .",
    "the partition function takes the following form if @xmath4 $ ] in ( [ partfunc ] ) is the standard wilson action @xmath7 \\prod_{c } j(v_c ) \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath8 are plaquette matrices , @xmath9 is the invariant haar measure of @xmath1 .",
    "the product over @xmath10 runs over all cubes of the lattice .",
    "the jacobian @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 where the sum over @xmath13 is a sum over all representations of @xmath1 , @xmath14 is the dimension of the representation @xmath13 .",
    "the last expression is nothing but an @xmath1 delta - function which introduces certain constraint on the plaquette matrices .",
    "this constraint is just the lattice form of the bianchi identity .",
    "the @xmath1 character @xmath15 depends on an ordered product of @xmath1 matrices as dictated by the bianchi identity .",
    "its exact form will be given in the next section .",
    "an important point is that in the non - abelian case the resulting constraints on the plaquette matrices appear to be highly - nonlocal and this fact makes an analytical study of the model rather difficult . in particular , it has prevented so far the construction of any well controlled and useful weak - coupling expansion .",
    "a different plaquette formulation of @xmath2 @xmath1 lgt has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "it has a local form and does not require gauge fixing . unfortunately , as we have found by explicit computations the model proposed in @xcite does not coincide with the wilson lgt contrary to the claim of @xcite .",
    "exact calculations on a @xmath16 lattice show the equivalence between wilson lgt and the model of @xcite but the equivalence is lost already for a @xmath17 lattice .",
    "the point is that the constraints on the plaquette matrices in the model of @xcite do not match the non - abelian bianchi identity as will be seen from our explicit calculations .",
    "nevertheless , we have found that a certain decomposition of the lattice made in @xcite can be useful in simplifying batrouni s original representation . in the next section",
    "we use some ideas of @xcite to reduce the number of connectors in constraints on plaquette matrices from four to two per each cube of the lattice .",
    "this simplifies the whole representation but still it is quite involved .",
    "let us also mention that there exists a plaquette representation in terms of so - called gauge - invariant plaquettes @xcite .",
    "this representation does not require gauge fixing and can be formulated both on finite and infinite lattices .",
    "it is quite possible to work also with this formulation , all the methods developed in this paper can be straightforwadly extended to the model of gauge - invariant plaquettes .",
    "we have nevertheless found that the plaquette formulation obtained in the maximal axial gauge is simpler to handle , especially on finite lattices .",
    "moreover , we shall explain how our formulation can be extended to periodic lattices .",
    "in addition to the previous works @xcite , @xcite , @xcite we include also dynamical fermions in the plaquette formulation .    in spite of the complexity of the plaquette representation , we think it has certain advantages compared to the standard wilson representation . some of them have been mentioned and elaborated in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "duality transformations , coulomb - gas representation , strong coupling expansion look more natural and simpler in the plaquette formulation .",
    "it is also possible to develop a mean - field method which is gauge - invariant by construction and is in better agreement with monte - carlo data than any mean - field approach based on the mean - link method @xcite .",
    "nevertheless we believe that the main advantage of this formulation , not mentioned in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite lies in its applications to the low - temperature region .",
    "let @xmath18 be a plaquette matrix in @xmath1 lgt .",
    "the rigorous result of @xcite asserts that the probability @xmath19 that @xmath20 is bounded by @xmath21 uniformly in the volume .",
    "thus , all configurations with @xmath22 are exponentially suppressed .",
    "this is equivalent to the statement that the gibbs measure of @xmath1 lgt at large @xmath23 is strongly concentrated around configurations on which @xmath24 .",
    "this property justifies expansion of the plaquette matrices around unity when @xmath23 is sufficiently large while there is no such justification for the expansion of link matrices , especially in the large volume limit .",
    "in particular , we think that replacing @xmath25 in the gibbs measure by a gaussian distribution , in the region of sufficiently large @xmath23 is a well justified approximation .",
    "in fact , all the corrections to this approximation must be non - universal .",
    "actually , this is one of our motivations to construct a low - temperature , i.e. large-@xmath23 expansion of gauge models using the plaquette representation .",
    "the well - known problem of the standard perturbation theory ( pt ) , i.e. whether pt is uniformly valid in the volume , can be shortly formulated in the following way . when the volume is fixed , and in the maximal axial gauge the link matrices perform small fluctuations around the unit matrix and the pt works very well producing the asymptotic expansion in inverse powers of @xmath23",
    "however , in the large volume limit the integrand becomes arbitrarily flat even in the maximal axial gauge .",
    "it means that in the thermodynamic limit ( tl ) the system deviates arbitrarily far from the ordered perturbative state , so that no saddle point exists anymore , i.e. configurations of link matrices are distributed uniformly in the group space . that there are problems with the conventional pt was shown in @xcite , where it was demonstrated that the pt results depend on the boundary conditions ( bc ) used to reach the tl .",
    "fortunately , even in the tl the plaquette matrices are close to unity , the inequality ( [ chestplaq ] ) holds and thus provides a basis for the construction of the low - temperature expansion in a different and mathematically reliable way . in this paper",
    "we develop such a weak - coupling expansion both for abelian and non - abelian models .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in the next section",
    "we give our plaquette formulation of @xmath2 @xmath1 lgt .",
    "we work in maximal axial gauge and consider a model with arbitrary local pure gauge action . for fermions",
    "we choose either the wilson or the kogut - susskind action .",
    "the plaquette representation will be formulated on a dual lattice for the partition function , t hooft and wilson loops . in section 3",
    "we construct the weak - coupling expansion for the abelian model using the plaquette representation .",
    "we give a general expansion for the partition function , calculate the zero - order generating functional and show how to compute corrections and expectation values of wilson loops .",
    "then , we extend the weak - coupling expansion to an arbitrary @xmath1 gauge model . here",
    "we give a general expansion of the boltzmann factor , explain how to treat the bianchi constraints in the expansion , compute the generating functional and establish some simple feynmann rules .",
    "finally , we discuss some features of the large-@xmath23 expansion in non - abelian models .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section 4 .",
    "some computations are moved to the appendices . in appendix",
    "a we study the link green functions which appear as the main building blocks of the expansion in the plaquette formulation . in the appendices",

    "in this section we give our formulation of the plaquette representation for @xmath2 @xmath1 lgt . a short description of our procedure can be found in @xcite for pure gauge theory and in @xcite for a theory with fermions . in subsection 2.1",
    "we calculate the plaquette representation for the partition function on a dual lattice . in the second subsection",
    "we derive the plaquette representation for some observables .",
    "let us first give a qualitative explanation of our transformations .",
    "consider the partition function given in eqs .",
    "( [ func ] ) and ( [ func2 ] ) . for the formulation of the bianchi identity related to a given @xmath58-cube",
    "we define according to @xcite a vertex @xmath59 in this cube and separated by the diagonal a vertex @xmath60 , see fig.[cube ] .",
    "this assignment we extend to all neighbouring cubes and finally to the whole lattice .",
    "thus , all @xmath59 vertices are separated by 2 lattice spacings , the same is true for @xmath60 vertices .",
    "next , we take a path connecting the vertices @xmath59 and @xmath60 by three links @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 as shown in fig.[cube ] .",
    "then the matrix @xmath64 in ( [ func ] ) and ( [ func2 ] ) entering the bianchi identity for the cube @xmath10 can be presented in the following form @xmath65 @xmath66 means an appropriately ordered product over three plaquettes of the cube attached to the vertex @xmath59 .",
    "the matrix @xmath67 defines a parallel transport of vertex @xmath59 into vertex @xmath60 and equals the product of three link matrices connecting @xmath59 and @xmath60 , see fig.[cube ] @xmath68 the connector @xmath67 plays a crucial role in the non - abelian bianchi identity .",
    "its path has to fit to the choices of @xmath66 and @xmath69 .",
    "we choose the structure of the connectors as shown in fig.[connector ] .",
    "this @xmath70-cube fragment of the lattice is repeated through the whole lattice by simple translation . as is seen from fig.[connector ]",
    "there are only four different types of connectors .",
    "for example , the connector @xmath71 is the same as @xmath72 .",
    "the collection of cubes with the same type of connectors , e.g. @xmath71 form on a dual lattice a body centred cubic ( bcc ) lattice with double lattice spacing .",
    "there are four different sub - lattices of this type corresponding to the four types of connectors in fig.[connector ] : @xmath71 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , and therefore four different types of bianchi identities .",
    "consider now the partition function given by eq .",
    "( [ partfuncorig ] ) on a @xmath2 lattice with free or dirichlet bc in the third direction and periodic bc in other directions for the link matrices . to get the plaquette representation we make a change of variables ( [ plaqch ] ) in the partition function ( [ partfuncorig ] )",
    ". then the partition function gets the form @xmath76 \\right \\ }   \\prod_p \\",
    "j(v_p ) \\ , \\label{partfunctr}\\ ] ] where the jacobian of the transformation reads @xmath77 the last equation is rather formal , for we have to specify the order of multiplications of non - abelian matrices .",
    "an important point concerns the position of the plaquette matrix within the product of link matrices .",
    "the plaquette matrices @xmath18 we insert at the vertices @xmath59 or @xmath60 of each plaquette attached to @xmath59 or @xmath60 , correspondingly . to write down the plaquette delta - functions in ( [ jacobdef ] )",
    "explicitly we use the following conventions : 1 ) a plaquette is always defined as @xmath78 with @xmath79 , i.e. it starts from the smallest possible coordinate ; 2 ) plaquette matrices are inserted as @xmath18 , not @xmath80 in all vertices @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "then , for instance , the six delta - functions for the cube @xmath71 in fig.[connector ] can be written with the notations of fig.[origincube ] as @xmath81 the change of variables in ( [ plaqch ] ) is uniquely determined from these expressions .",
    "similar expressions can be written for all types of connectors using the same rules .",
    "now we want to map one of the plaquette delta s to a delta - function for the cube using all other delta s .",
    "this procedure can be done for all cubes of the lattice in the following way .",
    "we start from the plane @xmath82 and use space - like plaquettes ( i.e. , lying in the @xmath83-plane ) to map them onto cube delta - function . for the above cube @xmath71 it means that we take the plaquette delta for @xmath84 and substitute link matrices by their expressions obtained from all other delta s .",
    "then we repeat these calculations for all cubes .",
    "one should be careful about the order in which the cubes are taken since to accomplish such calculations for all cubes , the order is important .",
    "we can proceed strictly plane by plane and stop at the plane @xmath85 .",
    "there are still space - like plaquettes left in the plane @xmath86 .",
    "the connector for a given cube is taken in accordance with fig.[connector ] .",
    "therefore , we mapped all space - like plaquette delta s lying on the top of a given cube onto cube deltas with connectors lying on the bottom of this cube ( in the gauge @xmath87 defined below ) .",
    "for instance , if the original plaquette lies in the plane @xmath88 , then the connector lies in the plane @xmath89 .",
    "these cube delta - functions become samples for the bianchi constraints . in this way",
    "we arrive at the following expression for the jacobian ( [ jacobdef ] ) @xmath90 where @xmath11 is given in ( [ func2 ] ) .",
    "@xmath91 runs over all time - like plaquettes and @xmath92 means a product over all cubes with the @xmath93-th type of connector . in the unique notations of fig.[origincube ] , the matrices @xmath94 for different types of connectors @xmath95 ( see fig.[connector ] ) are given by @xmath96 @xmath97 @xmath98 @xmath99    the rest of the derivation follows closely ref.@xcite .",
    "choose the maximal axial gauge in the form @xmath100 for the dirichlet bc one has @xmath101 .",
    "note , that the gauge fixing procedure and the procedure described above are freely interchangeable .",
    "after gauge fixing one can easily obtain expressions for link variables in terms of plaquettes .",
    "first of all , space - like links from the plane @xmath82 can be trivially integrated out removing all plaquette but bianchi delta s from the corresponding cubes near the top boundary of the lattice .",
    "further , we observe that expressions for link variables will depend on the position of a link relatively to the vertex @xmath59 or @xmath60 .",
    "as example , consider a line containing vertices @xmath60 in @xmath102 direction , @xmath103 being fixed and let one of the vertices @xmath60 have the coordinates @xmath104 .",
    "then one finds for the link @xmath105 @xmath106 while for the link @xmath107 @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the plaquette matrix from the @xmath110-plane .",
    "similar expressions one obtains for all links entering in or coming out of the considered line .",
    "obviously , the same rules apply for links in direction @xmath111 as well as for lines containing vertices @xmath59 . using these expressions",
    "one can easily integrate out all link variables in ( [ jacob1 ] ) . clearly , the presence of the fermion determinant can not change the integration procedure . in what follows",
    "we pass to the dual lattice where cubes become sites , links become plaquettes and sites become cubes . on the dual lattice our original notations of fig.[origincube ] for the cube @xmath71 become as in fig.[dualcube",
    "this helps us to obtain explicit expressions for the jacobian .",
    "now we can write down the plaquette representation for the @xmath1 gauge model on the dual lattice @xmath112 + \\sum_{f=1}^{n_f } { \\rm   tr }   \\ln a_f \\left [ c(x),c(x^{\\prime } ) ; u_l[v_l ] \\right ] \\right ]   \\nonumber    \\\\   & \\times & \\prod_{i=1}^4   \\ \\prod_{x(i ) } \\ j\\left ( v_x^{(i ) } \\right ) \\ , \\label{dualpart}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath113 denote four bcc sub - lattices , @xmath114 runs over all sites of such a bcc sub - lattice and @xmath115 is an @xmath1 delta - function ( [ func2 ] ) .",
    "to visualise calculations in the next sections we give here full expressions for the matrices @xmath116 .",
    "as example , we also give the graphical representation of the bianchi identity for the cube @xmath71 in fig.[delta ] .",
    "to write down the full expressions we choose a coordinate system on the dual lattice as shown in fig.[delta ] .",

    "instead of the maximal axial gauge which is not compatible with the periodic bc one can fix the following gauge @xmath136 \\ ; \\",

    "the expressions for connectors are modified : they include the values of the polyakov lines .",
    "therefore , one can express the final result in terms of plaquettes and these polyakov lines ( [ plgauge ] ) .      in this subsection",
    "we derive on the dual lattice a representation for the t hooft line and the wilson loop .",
    "we consider first a t hooft line which in @xmath2 consists of a string @xmath138 of dual links between the sites @xmath130 and @xmath139 on the dual lattice",
    ". for simplicity let us restrict ourselves to pure gauge theory with the wilson action . with the set @xmath140 of plaquettes dual to the string",

    "therefore , one can say that the bianchi constraint is violated at these endpoints . for example , for the @xmath151 gauge group @xmath152 and @xmath153 has the form @xmath154 this delta - function constrains the product of non - abelian matrices to @xmath155",
    "now we give a dual expression for a wilson loop of size @xmath156 in some representation @xmath157 .",
    "suppose , for simplicity that the loop contour lies in the @xmath158 plane and @xmath159 , @xmath140 are even .",
    "generelizing the consideration of the previous subsection it is straightforward to show that such a wilson loop has the following dual form @xmath160 as one can see , the connectors are not cancelled in the general from the wilson loop .",
    "one can simplify this expression taking one side of the loop in the plane @xmath86 .",
    "then the wilson loop is an ordered product of dual links which all lay inside the area spanned by the loop @xmath67 , i.e. the first line in the last formula is unity .",
    "this section is devoted to the construction of the low - temperature expansion of gauge models in the plaquette formulation . in doing this",
    "we follow the strategy developed for the two - dimensional principal chiral models in @xcite . in that paper",
    "a low - temperature expansion was constructed for @xmath1 spin models in the link formulation .",
    "this formulation appears to be closely related to the plaquette formulation of @xmath2 gauge models .",
    "for example , as was shown in @xcite and @xcite in both cases the strong coupling expansion is the expansion towards restoration of the bianchi identity .",
    "as will be seen below , the weak - coupling expansion in both models also bears many common features . in the abelian case they turn out to be practically identical , while the only ( but essential ) difference in the non - abelian gauge models is the appearance of connectors .",
    "a lattice pt in the maximal axial gauge was constructed for abelian and non - abelian models in the standard wilson formulation by f.  mller and w.  rhl in @xcite . in this gauge",
    "the pt for non - abelian models displays serious infrared divergences in separate terms of the expansion starting from @xmath161 order for the wilson loop and from @xmath162 for the free energy .",
    "of course , it is expected that all divergences must cancel in all gauge invariant quantities . in @xcite",
    "the authors worked out a special procedure of how to deal with such divergences .",
    "the essential ingredients of the procedure of @xcite are the following : 1 ) fixing the dirichlet bc in one direction and the periodic ones in other directions ; 2 ) a wilson loop under consideration is placed at distance @xmath159 from the boundary and the limit @xmath163 is imposed to restore time translation invariance ; 3 ) divergent green functions must be properly regularised , though there is no a priori preference to any regularization . with this procedure",
    "the first two coefficients of the expansion of wilson loop expectation values in @xmath151 lgt have been computed .",
    "these coefficients appear to be infrared finite in all @xmath164 and are proportional to the perimeter of the loop in @xmath6 and to @xmath165 in @xmath2 ( for a rectangular loop @xmath156 ) .",
    "we are not aware of any proof of the infrared finiteness at higher orders of the expansion . that there could be a problem with the infrared behaviour was shown however in @xcite .",
    "namely , in the addition to the dirichlet bc on the boundary , one link was fixed in the middle of the lattice and it was shown that the tl value of the expectation value of the plaquette to which the fixed link belong differs from that obtained in @xcite .",
    "the underlying reason of such infrared behaviour lies , of course in the fact that the conventional pt is done around the vacuum @xmath166 which is the true ground state only at fixed @xmath28 , even in the maximal axial gauge .",
    "when the volume grows the fluctuations of the link matrices become larger and larger and may cause an infrared unstable behaviour .",

    "no such control exists for large fluctuations of the link gauge matrices in the large volume limit .    the next observation which can be deduced examining",
    "the zero order partition function is that the low - temperature expansion is an expansion which starts from the abelian bianchi identity for each component of the non - abelian field and goes towards restoration of the full non - abelian identity ( compare with the strong coupling expansion , @xcite ) .",

    "connectors generate contributions of the form @xmath249 and of high order to all @xmath250 , see eqs.([conanglexp ] ) , ( [ wkx1con])-([wkx2con ] ) . and though all @xmath213 behave like @xmath251 it is not obvious if it remains true for the sums of the plaquette angles along connectors . since in the tl",

    "in this article we proposed a plaquette formulation of non - abelian lattice gauge theories .",

    "we have also included dynamical fermions in our construction .",
    "the main formula of section 2 , eq.([dualpart ] ) , gives a plaquette formulation for gauge models with dynamical fermions . as an application of our formulation we have developed a weak - coupling expansion which can be used for a perturbative evaluation of both the free energy and gauge invariant quantities like the wilson loop .",
    "we believe that this work can be useful in at least two aspects .",
    "the first concerns the problem of the uniformity of the perturbative expansion in non - abelian models and is described in section 3 . the second aspect concerns the perturbative expansion of lattice models with actions different from the wilson action . practically , all standard actions discussed in the literature have a very simple form in the plaquette formulation .",
    "the hardest part in the perturbative expansion is to treat contributions from the jacobian . since the jacobian represents bianchi constraints on the plaquette matrices and is the same whatever original action",
    "is taken it is sufficient to compute contributions from the jacobian only one time and use the result for all actions .",
