    "a fundamental question in the study of supernovae is the fate of a star subject to an explosion of a given strength : is the star completely disrupted , and , if not , how much of the star is lost and what is the configuration of the matter that remains bound ?",
    "many researchers have addressed this question for specific cases of interest using detailed numerical simulations . to our knowledge ,",
    "a precise quantitative relationship between the strength of the explosion and the fate of the outer layers has not been given before , even for highly idealized stellar models .",
    "the potential utility of such a relationship is evident in the analysis of @xcite , where a simple `` rule of thumb , '' introduced to estimate the amount of mass left bound in a supernova , allows a determination of which high mass stars leave behind neutron stars and which ones yield black holes .",
    "the `` rule of thumb '' stipulates that a portion ( between 30 and 50 per cent ) of the explosion energy is effective in directly unbinding the outermost layers of a star ; this estimate is based on detailed simulations by @xcite for a set of specific stellar progenitors .",
    "our goal is to improve the understanding of the disruption process by carrying out hydrodynamical calculations of simple , polytropic stellar models with a range of explosion strengths , polytropic indices , and equations of state .",
    "we intend this sort of calculation to complement , not replace , the realistic , detailed simulations that are the current state - of - the - art in this field .",
    "physical complications such as density jumps , neutrino transport , and aspherical motions are absent from our calculations . instead , our goal is to incorporate the essential physics ",
    "hydrodynamics and gravity  in models that are easy to compute and useful to the study of supernovae in the same way that the polytrope itself is useful to stellar modeling .",
    "we note that this subject has been treated before , in a very different perturbative calculation @xcite .",
    "already , our results yield improved versions of the `` rule of thumb , '' which we provide in a simple , easily applied , empirical form .",
    "although a host of significant core - collapse modeling uncertainties remain ( hydrodynamic motions in the core , distribution of angular momentum within the collapsing object , neutrino - matter coupling , etc . ) , our simplified treatment represents an improvement in the determination of the fate of central remnants  providing a convenient bridge between estimates of mass loss based upon simple physical assumptions and more sophisticated , realistic simulations .",
    "there is considerable evidence that a supernova explosion occurred in j1655 - 40 : the atmosphere of its companion is contaminated with elements thought to be formed only in supernovae @xcite , and it is likely that the black hole progenitor was considerably more massive than the remnant we see today @xcite .",
    "there is also some evidence that the j1655 - 40 system could have remained bound only if it received a substantial kick during or shortly after the formation of its black hole @xcite .",
    "while our current models are too simple to provide definitive results for any particular system , we believe that the methods employed here suggest that the progenitor mass was less than twice the mass of today s remnant .",
    "mass fallback may trigger the collapse to a black hole as well as pollute the companion s atmosphere . in section 2",
    ", we describe the physical set up , while section 3 describes the numerical code . in section 4",
    ", we give more detailed results and discuss how the numerical data were analyzed , and in section 5 we comment on our results lack of dependence on the inner boundary condition .",
    "we model the supernova as a spherically symmetric explosion in a stellar model that is initially in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the pre - explosion stellar structure is polytropic .",
    "we deposit the full energy of the explosion in a small region near the centre of the polytrope . using a finite - difference code we calculate the hydrodynamical evolution . a shock propagates towards the surface and the outer layers of the stellar model",
    "may be ejected .",
    "if it is not completely destroyed , part of the model remains gravitationally bound and we follow the evolution long enough to make an accurate estimate of the mass of the remnant .",
    "we considered a _ range of initial stellar structures_. we varied the polytropic index @xmath0 where @xmath1 .",
    "the lane - emden equation prescribes the run of density and pressure in the initial model ; our choices for @xmath2 span @xmath3 . as is well - known , the polytrope s ratio of central to mean density increases as @xmath4 varies from @xmath5 to @xmath6 .",
    "this range subsumes typical main - sequence profiles and extended red - giant structures .",
    "we considered _ two equation of state treatments _ : ideal gas pressure ( `` eos m '' : @xmath7 with a fixed ratio of specific heats @xmath8 ) and a mixture of gas plus radiation in thermal equilibrium ( `` eos mr '' : @xmath9 ) .",
    "eos m is suitable for stellar models of low mass ( dominated by particle pressure at their centres ) and weak explosions ( such that the post - shock gas is not radiation dominated ) ; eos mr is needed if there is significant radiation pressure .",
    "we infer the temperature profile from the appropriate eos and the lane - emden pressure - density profile .",
    "for eos mr , we chose to limit ourselves to _ convectively stable polytropic models .",
    "_ we will discuss the condition for stability in  4.2 . to facilitate the description of our problem s parameter space ,",
    "let @xmath10 . as we will show in  4.1 , for a given polytropic index @xmath4 , the choice of @xmath11 uniquely fixes the mass of the resulting stellar model .",
    "we define our mass scale to be @xmath12 .",
    "we then chose the dimensionless masses of the stellar models we exploded to be @xmath13 for a range of ( @xmath4 , @xmath11 ) pairs , taking care to remain in the convectively stable region of parameter space .",
    "see tab.[tab : starmasses ] and fig.[fig : stabstars ] .",
    "we considered a _ variety of explosion energies_. given our interest in studying explosions which only partially unbind the stellar models , we typically considered blasts with @xmath14 , _ i.e. _ energies of the same order of magnitude as a simple dimensional estimate for unbinding .    in brief , the results we obtained were as follows .",
    "* the amount of mass lost as a function of explosion energy makes a discrete jump from approximately 50 to 100 per cent in all models , suggesting a point of instability .",
    "* explosions that do not totally disrupt a stellar model give rise to mass loss curves that , in most cases , scale quadratically with explosion energy .",
    "these simulations did not include any sort of compact object at the core of our explosions .",
    "we explored the sensitivity of the mass loss to _ our treatment of the inner boundary condition_. we found that to a large extent the results are unchanged :    * when two extreme inner boundary conditions  a ` vacuum cleaner ' core that sucks up any incident material , and its opposite , a hard , reflecting shell  were compared , the mass loss results were virtually identical .",
    "readers primarily interested in further details regarding these results are encouraged to skip to  4 .",
    "we use the inviscid fluid equations which describe mass , momentum and energy conservation .",
    "all calculations are one - dimensional with either a plane - parallel ( for testing ) or spherical ( for testing and simulations ) geometry .",
    "we advance the fluid state using a finite difference approximation to the fluid equations ( lax - wendroff , explicitly differenced , 1-d lagrangian code [ @xcite ] ) .",
    "shocks are handled with the addition of artificial viscosity .",
    "we solve poisson s equation to determine the gravitational forces at each time step .",
    "details are provided in appendices a - c.      we tested the purely hydrodynamic capabilities of the code ( no gravity ) via comparison with the sod shock tube ( plane - parallel geometry ) and sedov blast ( spherical geometry ) solutions . for the sod test with @xmath15 ( as well as for a range of other @xmath8 s ) , eos m , various overpressures ( @xmath16 ) , and @xmath17 zones , we found essentially perfect agreement between the numerical and analytic solutions , except for the shock smearing over @xmath18 zones .    for the sedov problem ,",
    "we re - derived the solution given in _",
    "fluid mechanics _ by @xcite , thereby finding the correction to that solution s typographical error ( in an exponent ) mentioned in shu s _ gas dynamics_. the correction is recorded in appendix d. we carried out a number of blast wave simulations , varying our choices of eos and @xmath8 .",
    "for flows dominated by particle pressure we compared numerical solutions ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 for eos m ) with the analytic similarity solution ; for flows dominated by radiation pressure we compared several different radiation - dominated numerical solutions ( @xmath21 , eos mr ) to the @xmath22 similarity solution .",
    "the radiation - dominated numerical solutions were generated by explosions yielding high - mach - number shocks .",
    "a range of initial radiation - to - matter pressure ratios @xmath23 and explosion energies were considered .",
    "one simulation with large constant @xmath24 and relatively small explosion energy and another simulation with small constant @xmath25 and large energy both yielded a radiation - dominated post - shock flows .    in all calculations ,",
    "the explosion was allowed to expand to well over 100 times the size of the initial  bomb zone .",
    "\" comparisons of eos m runs with analytic solutions were possible throughout the simulation ; comparisons of eos mr runs with the analytic radiation - dominated @xmath22 similarity solution were meaningful only for the part of the simulation in which radiation pressure dominated matter pressure , approximately 4 - 5 expansion times . with @xmath26 zones , the sedov test gave close ( @xmath27 per cent ) agreement in the relative density , velocity and pressure of the numerical solution and the analytic similarity solution for both particle pressure dominated and radiation pressure dominated flows except in the central - most region .",
    "two factors contribute to the discrepancies at the centre .",
    "first , the innermost zone was treated as an adiabatic expanding / contracting bubble .",
    "the entropy of this zone was incorrect but its mass was so small that its impact on the rest of the solution was inconsequential .",
    "the explosion results were found to be almost entirely insensitive to alternative methods of treating this innermost zone , provided the treatments were energy conserving .",
    "second , explosive energy was injected in a small , but non - negligible central region ( typically the inner 5 per cent of the mass ) .",
    "quantitative differences between the analytic similarity solution and the numerical solution occurred in the part of the grid used as the `` bomb zone '' and persisted through the simulation .",
    "these differences were not unexpected , as the point - like nature of the explosion in the similarity solution can not be realized in any finite simulation .",
    "we also compared two models for the energy injection at the centre .",
    "in one , the `` thermal bomb , '' an excess of thermal energy equal to the desired explosion energy was added by hand to the core ( inner 5 per cent of the mass ) of the stellar model , essentially creating an out - of - equilibrium hot core that then expanded rapidly into the stellar envelope . in the other ,",
    "the `` kinetic bomb , '' a linear velocity profile carrying the same amount of energy was added to the inner 5 per cent of the mass .",
    "both methods produced identical results outside the `` bomb zone . ''      with the inclusion of self - gravity forces , we verified that runge - kutta integration of the lane - emden equations yielded stationary , stable configurations for our time - dependent hydrodynamic evolution equations ( finite difference scheme ) .",
    "we checked the long - lived stability for all polytropic indices and radiation - to - gas pressure ratios adopted in this study .",
    "likewise , we tested that the virial theorem was satisfied by the initial configurations .      in the actual runs of the problem of interest , we further verified that the treatment of the central zone made no discernible difference , that variations in the size of the  bomb zone \" ( 3 - 10 per cent , for instance ) , caused only very slight ( @xmath28 per cent ) changes to the amount of mass lost in the explosions .",
    "we also verified that energy conservation was satisfied ( to @xmath29 per cent ) .",
    "we adopted polytropes for the initial stellar structure with @xmath30 .",
    "the density and pressure profiles were determined by solving the lane - emden equation with the total mass and radius scaled to unity .",
    "we refer to this as the dimensionless solution ; it depends only upon @xmath0 .",
    "the dimensionless density - pressure distributions are the forms used in our computations .",
    "all results are likewise reported using dimensionless quantities ( explosion energy in terms of binding energy , mass loss in terms of the total mass , etc . ) .",
    "let us first review the scaling of the initial polytropic solution . for given @xmath31 and @xmath32 in the pressure - density relation , it is possible to generate a one - parameter family of scaled solutions with @xmath33 with @xmath34 a dimensionless number depending on polytropic index .",
    "we can construct a polytropic progenitor without radiation pressure , but that is an idealization that is approximately correct only in the limit of a low ratio of radiation to gas pressure . if the matter has an ideal gas equation of state , @xmath35 , there must be nonzero temperature inside the stellar model , and hence nonzero radiation pressure @xmath36 . under some circumstances",
    ", @xmath37 will be low both in the progenitor and in the ejecta after the stellar model explodes .",
    "the explosions of such models have a universal mass loss fraction as a function of @xmath0 and explosion energy in units of the stellar binding energy .    imposing a fixed value of the radiation - to - gas pressure @xmath38 at the centre of the stellar model before the explosion reduces the scaling of the dimensionless solution",
    ". these models also have a universal mass loss fraction as a function of @xmath39 @xmath40 and explosion energy .",
    "the reason the scaling is reduced is because specifying @xmath11 determines the stellar mass for a given value of @xmath0 independent of @xmath31 : @xmath41 where @xmath42 , and @xmath43 ^ 2[f_p(\\gamma)]^{-3/2}$ ] , with @xmath44 and @xmath45 , which are both dimensionless functions of polytropic index only . for @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , so @xmath49 ; for @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , so @xmath53 . in the low mass limit , this implies @xmath54 .",
    "thus , from eq .",
    "( [ mreqn ] ) , the combination @xmath55 is determined given @xmath0 and @xmath11 .",
    "recovering the @xmath56 limit is subtle , since it also implies low mass @xmath57 . to summarize : for eos mr",
    ", we use eq .",
    "( [ eddington ] ) to solve for @xmath11 given @xmath57 in terms of @xmath58 .",
    "in this paper we will adopt the point of view that @xmath31 is not known _ a priori _ and we will allow scaling of the polytropic solution to arbitrary @xmath57 and @xmath59 in cases with no radiation pressure . in cases with radiation pressure , although @xmath57 is determined from eq .",
    "( [ eddington ] ) , some scaling remains since eq .",
    "( [ mreqn ] ) relates @xmath59 and @xmath31 , given @xmath57 and @xmath0 , but does not determine either one separately .",
    "if we begin with the first law of thermodynamics , t ds = de + pdv , and use eos mr , together with some of the relations derived in appendix b , we can put it in the form tds = f(s , n)dp/. since @xmath60 , local convective stability requires @xmath61 .",
    "the condition is n > n_crit = , where we have used @xmath62 to distinguish between this function of @xmath63 and the constant parameter @xmath11 . for stability",
    ", we require that the local condition be satisfied throughout the model .",
    "the variation of @xmath64 depends upon @xmath4 : s_r(1+s_r)^4p^3-n1+n .",
    "there are three characteristic cases    1 .   for @xmath65 , the largest value of @xmath64 is @xmath66 , so the largest value of @xmath67 is @xmath68 and therefore if @xmath69 , the stellar model is stable .",
    "* for all @xmath70 , eq .",
    "( 5 ) implies @xmath71 , so no polytrope with @xmath72 can be stable . * for @xmath73",
    ", there is a maximum value of @xmath11 for which the stellar model is stable , determined from @xmath74 , which rises from @xmath75 at @xmath46 to @xmath76 for @xmath50 .",
    "for instance , at @xmath77 , @xmath78 ; for @xmath79 , @xmath80 ( see tab .  [",
    "tab : starmasses ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : stabstars ] ) .",
    "2 .   for @xmath50",
    ", @xmath64 is constant .",
    "since @xmath81 for any finite @xmath64 , all models are stable .",
    "3 .   for @xmath82 ,",
    "@xmath83 at the polytrope s edge ( where @xmath84 ) , so for any choice of @xmath11 the largest value of @xmath85 .",
    "all models are stable .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the convective - stability condition described here is not an absolute stability criterion .",
    "stellar models outside of this mass range can certainly exist ; they will simply have convection zones .",
    "the unstable region in fig .",
    "[ tab : starmasses ] arises because of our insistence on an exact polytropic pressure - density relation ( @xmath86 ) and our use of eos mr .",
    "we restrict our studies to stable models .",
    "these already span a wide range of density profiles  which is the basic physical property that governs shock propagation  from the highly centrally - condensed @xmath87 polytropes to the diffuse @xmath88 models . an unstable ( polytropic ) model would represent an unphysical and unnatural initial state .",
    "actual convective stars involve physics beyond the scope of our simple , idealized , one - dimensional approach .",
    ".[tab : starmasses ] summary of the parameters describing the models we have studied , where @xmath89 [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "our previous results show that mass loss occurs in two distinct phases when the stellar model is not completely unbound .",
    "the initial shock wave drives off some mass immediately while the ringing down of the remnant expels loosely bound outer shells over a period of several dynamical times .",
    "none of our models included a compact object at the centre and one naturally wonders whether the later mass loss might be sensitive to the treatment of the centre of the stellar model .    to test the effect of the inner regions on the mass loss , we considered two different ways of modifying the inner boundary condition .",
    "in one , we placed a hard , reflecting sphere at a fixed , very small spatial radius ; in the other , we fixed a perfectly absorbing boundary at a given radius .",
    "we ran several cases : polytropes of indices @xmath4 between 1.5 and 4 , with a variety of values of @xmath90 . for the reflecting sphere ,",
    "the size was set to that of the innermost zone ; for the absorbing sphere , the absorbing boundary varied between 2 and 30 percent of the mass in lagrangian coordinates .",
    "the mass loss computed with these altered inner boundary conditions differed little from what was found in our earlier survey .",
    "the changes to the mass loss were unnoticeable even when quite a large inner region  as much as 15 - 20 per cent , in mass  of the stellar model was allowed to become pressure - free and perfectly absorbing .",
    "this insensitivity is linked to the fact that at least 50 per cent of the star remains bound if the star survives the explosion . in those cases , on the one hand , the trading of energy among the outer shells determines the amount of mass lost ; the inner half of the stellar model , whose dynamics are sensitive to the treatment of the inner zones , is never in danger of being lost . in stellar models that are totally dispersed , on the other hand",
    ", the explosion is so violent that differences in the inner boundary conditions have little effect , since no portion of the stellar model ever falls back to experience them .    to gain a better qualitative understanding of why the mass loss results are so insensitive to the inner boundary condition , we examined more closely the slowly - varying disturbances propagating in our remnant .",
    "the energy density in a small - wavelength oscillatory mode is proportional to local density times the square of local gas displacement ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "we computed this combination  as well as local velocity squared times local density  as a function of radius at various times in our models , using each lagrangian zone s displacement from its final , at - rest location .",
    "we found that both quantities always go to zero at the remnant core , implying that there is little energy flux into or out of this region .",
    "therefore , information about the altered inner boundary conditions is not effectively transmitted to the oscillating outer mass shells .",
    "the inner boundary condition plays no obvious role in the late - time mass loss so long as there is a sufficient amount of buffering gas between the inner core and the outside of the star . in our numerical tests",
    ", we found that it was necessary to alter almost the entire inner quarter of the stellar model s mass before the mass loss was significantly affected .",
    "here , we have confined ourselves to a rather idealized problem , partially disruptive explosions of simplified stellar models whose density profiles are solutions to the lane - emden equation , but with varying ratios of radiation to matter pressure . in this way , we have been able to survey models in a well - defined parameter space fairly extensively , trading the concreteness of real stellar models for the flexibility of parametrized ideal models .",
    "specifically , we have determined the fraction of the original stellar mass ejected as a function of explosion energy in polytropes of index @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 in calculations without radiation pressure ; we also explored the mass loss fractions for stellar models of @xmath95 and @xmath96 over a range of @xmath4 from 2.0 to 4.0 .",
    "our results suggest that the mass loss is remarkably uniform , even among widely varying stellar density profiles and over an enormous range in stellar masses .",
    "we have provided a simple , parametrized formula for the fractional mass loss as a function of explosion energy for a range of values of @xmath4 and the ratio of radiation to matter pressures ; see eq .",
    "( [ fitdata ] ) and table  [ tab : massloss ] .",
    "one striking feature of all the models we tested was that the mass loss fraction as a function of explosion energy appears to be discontinuous at around 50 per cent mass loss , with a small ( few per cent ) difference in explosion energy separating stellar models which lose half their mass from totally disrupted stellar models .",
    "because our simulations did not include formation of a compact remnant at the centre , this result can not be taken as a concrete demonstration that the observation of a black hole of mass @xmath57 demands a progenitor whose mass was less than about twice as large .",
    "the abrupt transition between moderate ( _ i.e. _ @xmath97 per cent ) and total disruption found here for wide classes of initial models is also seen in modelling of explosions in sets of specific progenitors ( _ e.g. _ @xcite , table 3 ; @xcite , table 1 ) .",
    "thus , we conjecture that even when a compact central remnant is included , the results divide into two separate cases depending on whether the explosion energy is above or below , approximately , the critical value found here for complete disruption .",
    "it is significant that this bifurcation effect occurs , as it does in our simulation , at the most basic , hydrodynamic level , implying that its appearance in more sophisticated models rests chiefly on these underlying physics . for explosion energies below this critical value",
    ", there is a sharp transition between modest ( _ i.e. _ @xmath98 per cent ) mass loss and total disruption apart from the compact remnant . for explosion energies above the cutoff",
    ", either a black hole or neutron star may form .",
    "however , in this case , we expect much smaller fallback masses , generally only a few tenths of @xmath99 or less , primarily caused by reverse shock propagation through the core , and the consequent deceleration of a small amount of outgoing matter ( _ e.g. _ @xcite )",
    ".    we should emphasize that our conjectures here may be significantly modified by the inclusion of more realistic physics .",
    "spherically - symmetric polytropic stellar models are not real stars ; neither are all the complexities of stellar hydrodynamics captured by simple equations of state",
    ". one important component of realistic stars that our models lack is the sequence of density discontinuities that emerge in evolved stars , which we would expect to cause reflected reverse shocks that could change the mass ejection dynamics considerably .",
    "furthermore , in real supernovae there are other sources of energy besides the initial explosion  such as decaying radioactive nuclei , central pulsars or jets  which continue to add energy to the supernova system at late times , possibly giving the boost needed to eject lightly - bound gas at the surface of the remnant .",
    "our imposition of spherical symmetry is also unrealistic : real explosion are likely to be anisotropic , and stellar rotation , convection , and magnetic fields are expected to have effects that a one - dimensional calculation can not hope to model . despite these caveats , we believe our chief results to be robust .",
    "supernovae frequently occur in binary systems . in such systems , when there are very energetic explosions and little mass fallback , we expect little mass contamination of the atmosphere of the binary companion .",
    "the outgoing regions of the progenitor intercepted by the companion are not captured ; indeed the outer layers of the companion are stripped and ablated by the ejecta . on the other hand ,",
    "when the explosion is weak and substantial mass fallback occurs , progenitor material may fall back onto the companion , polluting its atmosphere . in the latter cases , we would then infer that a remnant of mass @xmath57 was most likely derived from a progenitor with mass less than @xmath100 .",
    "thus , in systems like nova scorpii that show evidence for black hole formation in a supernova ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , we conjecture that mass of the pre - explosion star was , in fact , less than twice the present mass inferred for the black hole remnant ( which also has accreted matter since forming , presumably ) .",
    "this may have implications for the dynamics of such systems ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "we caution , though , that our results may be altered somewhat in more refined models .",
    "further studies are underway to include a compact central remnant , density jumps ( expected as a consequence of compositional inhomogeneity ) , rotation and explosion asymmetries",
    ". these new calculations will continue , in the same spirit as those reported here , to employ the simplest explosion models needed to reveal the underlying physical consequences of the various refinements , and to allow a survey of the hydrodynamics of a large range of explosion models .",
