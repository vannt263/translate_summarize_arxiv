    "in relation to the formation mechanism of compact binary systems such as double neutron star systems , double black hole systems or black hole  neutron star systems , hypercritical accretion flows onto neutron stars in envelopes of massive stars of close binary systems have been investigated by several authors  @xcite . the mass accretion rate ( @xmath2 ) of the hypercritical accretion flow amounts to @xmath3 times as high as the eddington s mass accretion limit .",
    "chevalier   found that for rather small values of the viscosity parameter , @xmath4 , the accretion flow which cools via neutrino radiation could be realized .",
    "recently bethe et al .",
    "pointed out that the flow with much larger and conservative values of the viscosity parameter , @xmath5 , does not become so hot as to emit neutrinos during the accretion process but that the accretion will proceed to the advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) . in their model , the accreted matter onto the neutron star surface is processed there by nuclear reactions and cools via neutrino emission .",
    "the hypercritical accretion increases the mass of the star rapidly and induces the collapse of the neutron star to a black hole .",
    "thus the supernova explosion of the massive companion will lead to the formation of a black hole ",
    "neutron star binary system or a double black hole binary system .",
    "the merging event of such a system might be one of the important targets for the gravitational wave astronomy .    in the accretion process , a non - negligible amount of angular momentum is carried into the neutron star .",
    "this potentially could spin up the star to the kepler limit , i.e. to the state where the stellar rotational frequency equals to the orbital frequency at the equatorial surface .",
    "the star rotating at the kepler limit deforms significantly from the spherical configuration and the subsequent collapse of the rapidly rotating star to a black hole might radiate a substantial fraction of the binding energy of the system in the form of gravitational waves .",
    "this seemingly straightforward conclusion , however , has to be reexamined from the standpoint of stability of rotating neutron stars .",
    "the gravitational radiation driven instability of rotating stars might prevent the stellar rotational frequency to increase above a certain limit .",
    "in particular , the recently discovered r - mode instability  @xcite might be sufficiently strong to suppress the spin frequency in some range of the stellar temperature .    in this paper , in order to see how this instability influences",
    "the accretion induced spin - up of the neutron star in the hypercritical accretion , we will employ the hypercritical adaf model based on the analysis of bethe et al .   and investigate the evolution of the temperature and the rotational frequency of the neutron star .",
    "it should be noted that the study in this paper is done in the framework of newtonian dynamics and newtonian gravity .",
    "the gravitational radiation reaction on stellar oscillations is evaluated by the lowest order post - newtonian approximation  @xcite . furthermore to simplify our analysis ,",
    "stellar configurations are assumed to be spherical polytropes , @xmath6 , with the polytropic index @xmath7 .",
    "here @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the pressure and the density , respectively . by choosing the polytropic coefficient @xmath10 appropriately ,",
    "the stellar mass is @xmath11 and its radius is @xmath12 km .",
    "note that the radius of the polytropes with index @xmath7 is independent of the central density and thus of the mass if the constant @xmath10 is fixed .",
    "the hypercritical accretion flow which we employ in this paper is proposed by bethe et al .  .",
    "the characteristics of that flow are summarized as follows .",
    "( 1 ) the flow is hypercritical because the accretion rate is typically @xmath13 . ( 2 ) since the flow is advection dominated  @xcite and its temperature is relatively low ( @xmath14mev ) , the adiabatic exponent of the gas equals to @xmath15 ( radiation dominated mixture of photon , electron , positron and nuclei ) . ( 3 ) the accreted matter touches down on the surface of the star ` softly ' and burns to produce as heavy nuclei as @xmath16 . on the other hand ,",
    "the matter is cooled by neutrino emission .",
    "consequently the whole process acts as a ` thermostat ' which keeps the neutrino temperature @xmath17mev .      the mass accretion rate @xmath18 , which is the rate of mass attachment to the star , is assumed to be constant during the evolution .",
    "in general the mass accretion rate should be distinguished from the mass inflow rate @xmath19 , which is the total amount of the incoming mass per unit time to the neutron star .",
    "this is because some kinds of outflow may coexist with the accreting flows . in this paper",
    "we simplify the situation by assuming that both rates are the same , i.e. @xmath20 .",
    "we will discuss this assumption further in _",
    "the evolution of the neutron star mass @xmath21 is written as : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the initial mass of the star ( in units of the solar mass ) , time @xmath24 is measured in units of second , and @xmath25 is defined as : @xmath26 \\ .\\ ] ]      the accreted matter landing on the surface layer is processed by nuclear burning and emits neutrinos .",
    "we will assume that roughly a half of them escapes from the star freely and that some fraction of the rest of them interacts with stellar matter and heats it up .",
    "the mean free path @xmath27 of inelastic scattering of neutrinos with electrons in the neutron star matter is written as  @xcite , @xmath28^{7/6 } \\left[\\frac{0.1 \\mbox{mev}}{e_\\nu}\\right]^{5/2 } \\mbox{cm } \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the ` nuclear density ' ( @xmath30 ) and @xmath31 is the neutrino energy .",
    "the density @xmath32 means the averaged density of the star , which is related in our polytropic stellar models to the mass @xmath21 as follows : @xmath33 the neutrino energy @xmath31 is fixed to @xmath34mev .",
    "we simply assume the scattering ( thus heating ) rate as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the stellar radius and @xmath37 is an efficiency factor of @xmath38-heating through the inelastic scattering .",
    "as the flow is adiabatic and radiation dominated , the specific internal energy of the accreted matter @xmath39 is written as , @xmath40 with these expressions , the heating rate of the whole star @xmath41 is , @xmath42\\left[\\frac{m}{m_{\\odot}}\\right]^{13/6 } \\mbox{erg } \\",
    "\\mbox{s}^{-1}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we choose @xmath43 .",
    "heating rate above is proportional to the multiplication of @xmath2 and @xmath37 .",
    "thus the reduction of @xmath37 is equivalent to that of @xmath2 with @xmath37 being fixed .",
    "as shown later in discussion , the dependence of the results on @xmath37 is weak .    as the cooling mechanism of the star ,",
    "we assume the modified urca process to be dominant  @xcite . its cooling rate @xmath44 is , @xmath45^{2/3 } t_9 ^ 8 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the stellar temperature , which is assumed to be uniform , in units of @xmath47k . the heat capacity @xmath48 of the neutron star which is approximated by the following formula if the neutron star is assumed to consist of degenerate free nucleons , @xmath49\\left[\\frac{\\bar{\\rho}}{\\rho_{\\rm nuc}}\\right]^{-2/3 } t_9 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath50 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "then the equation of the thermal balance of the star can be written as , @xmath51 this is transformed to the equation of the evolution of the temperature as follows : @xmath52^{1/3}t_9 ^ 2\\right ) & = & 6.5\\times10^{-5 } \\left[\\frac{\\dot{m}}{1 m_{\\odot}\\mbox{y}^{-1}}\\right]\\left[\\frac{m}{m_{\\odot}}\\right]^{13/6}\\nonumber\\\\   & - & 8.7\\times 10^{-9}\\left[\\frac{m}{m_{\\odot}}\\right]t_9 ^ 8 \\ .",
    "\\label{eq - thermal}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      the angular momentum of the star is changed by two torques induced by accretion and by gravitational radiation if the r - mode oscillation is unstable .",
    "the accretion torque is estimated as @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the specific angular momentum of the accreted matter : @xmath55 here the adaf solution by narayan & yi   is employed to evaluate the rotational velocity of the accreted matter at the stellar surface .    as for the gravitational radiation torque , we use the simple formula used in lindblom et al .   which also incorporates the damping effect by viscosity .",
    "this corresponds to the assumption that the r - mode quickly grows to saturate in the non - linear regime of its amplitude and the angular momentum of the mode is a substantial fraction of the stellar angular momentum .",
    "let us introduce the rate @xmath56 of the angular momentum of the mode to the stellar angular momentum . by using the moment of inertia of the star @xmath57 and the stellar rotational angular frequency @xmath58 ,",
    "the torque due to gravitational wave emission can be written as @xmath59 .",
    "the factor @xmath56 is related to the dimensionless amplitude of the oscillation of the r - mode ` @xmath60 ' , which is used in the simplified discussion of the non - linear evolution of the r - mode by owen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , as @xmath61 .",
    "the time scale of the r - mode instability @xmath62 is then defined as ,    @xmath63    where @xmath64 is the energy dissipation time scale by the gravitational radiation , @xmath65 is that of the shear viscosity due to neutron - neutron collision and @xmath66 is that of the bulk viscosity due to the lag of the @xmath67reaction and the stellar oscillation .",
    "the negative value of @xmath62 signals the onset of the instability .",
    "we set @xmath68 to be zero when this value is positive , i.e. for damping oscillations .",

    "( [ eq - thermal ] ) to be zero , the temperature can be solved as , @xmath81^{1/8 } \\left[\\frac{m}{m_{\\odot}}\\right]^{7/48 } \\ . \\label{t9expr}\\ ] ] thus for the star with mass @xmath82 and the accretion rate with @xmath83 , the ( uniform ) temperature will be about @xmath84k , which is near the most susceptible temperature for the r - mode instability to grow  @xcite .",
    "the equation of the angular momentum balance gives the terminal value of the rotational frequency of the star by setting the right hand side of eq.([eq - freq ] ) to be zero .",
    "if we omit the contributions of viscous damping whose effect is smallest near at the temperature obtained above , we get the expression for the terminal rotational frequency as : @xmath85 = 1.3~\\left[\\frac{\\dot{m}}{1 m_{\\odot } \\mbox{y}^{-1}}\\right]^{1/7 } \\left[\\frac{m}{m_\\odot}\\right]^{-3/14 } \\delta^{-1/7}.      \\label{f100expr}\\ ] ]      given the mass accretion rate and the initial values of the stellar mass , temperature and frequency , the evolution of the corresponding quantities can be followed by integrating eqs .",
    "( [ eq - mass ] ) , ( [ eq - thermal ] ) and ( [ eq - freq ] ) .",
    "we have computed several evolutionary sequences by choosing different sets for the initial values .",
    "we will show how the evolution depends on the initial values . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the rotational frequency is plotted against the mass of the star which serves as the ` time ' variable because the mass accretion rate is assumed to be constant . with",
    "the mass accretion rate fixed , solutions with different values of the initial frequency converges to a certain value rather quickly compared with the mass accretion time scale .",
    "this behaviour is expected from the rapid temperature saturation seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] by swift establishment of the thermal balance between heating and cooling .",
    "it should be pointed out that the omission of the r - mode instability would lead to very rapid increase of the rotational frequency and that the star would reach its mass - shedding limit before the accretion induced collapse occurs .",
    "the mass accretion rate dependence of the frequency evolution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the temperature of the star quickly saturates at the limiting value which depends on the mass accretion rate . since the strength of the r - mode instability depends on the temperature as well as the stellar rotational frequency , the rotational frequency also quickly saturates . as the time scale of the angular momentum change is longer than that of the temperature change ,",
    "the frequency saturation is reached slightly later compared with the temperature saturation .",
    "we have shown that the r - mode instability sets a severe limit on the rotational frequency of the hypercritically accreting neutron stars proposed by bethe et al .  .",
    "as the mass accretion rate dependence of the rotational frequency ( eq .  ( [ f100expr ] ) ) is rather weak , the rotational frequency of the star is well below its mass - shedding limit . even if the mass accretion rate rises to @xmath86 , the rotational frequency increases only to @xmath87hz .",
    "thus the gravitational collapse of neutron stars due to mass accretion to low mass black holes in these systems will proceed almost spherically and black holes formed just after the collapse will rotate so slowly that the rotational parameter is not large either , i.e. @xmath88 for @xmath89 .      the amount of gravitational radiation from the system can be evaluated as follows .",
    "the process discussed in this paper is similar to that studied by wagoner  .",
    "a neutron star in an x - ray binary system emits gravitational wave so as to balance the accretion torque with the gravitational radiation torque of the f - mode ( ` wagoner star ' ) . for our models the f - mode must be replaced by the r - mode and the accretion rate is considerably different , i.e. increased .",
    "the standard formula of the luminosity of gravitational radiation can be expressed as  @xcite , @xmath90 where @xmath91 are the eigenfrequency of the mode , the dimensionless strain of the gravitational field and the distance from the source , respectively . using the terminal rotational frequency @xmath76",
    "obtained above and the relation of the eigenfrequency and the angular velocity for @xmath92 modes , @xmath93 we get @xmath94^{3/7}\\left[\\frac{m}{m_\\odot}\\right]^{5/14}\\left[\\frac{d}{1\\mbox{kpc}}\\right]^{-1 } \\delta^{1/14}.\\ ] ] as seen from the result obtained in this paper , the rotational frequency becomes almost constant after a short time of accretion .",
    "thus it is rather easy to detect signals of the gravitational wave by integrating it for an appropriate interval of time .",
    "we here define the fourier component of the squared dimensionless strain @xmath95 as @xmath96 . then from the parseval s relation , @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the number of cycles of the oscillation in the interval of observation , @xmath99 .",
    "frequency width @xmath100 and @xmath99 are related by the uncertainty principle as , @xmath101 as @xmath102 , the r.m.s . of the fourier component of the strain",
    "is , @xmath103    the event rate @xmath104 of the hypercritical accretion is quite uncertain .",
    "the maximum value is expected to be @xmath105 , which is the birth rate of the close black hole ",
    "neutron star binary  @xcite .",
    "in order to detect @xmath106 events per year , we have to observe the region with the distance as follows : @xmath107 where @xmath108  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath109 is the number density of the massive galaxies ( @xmath110 )",
    ".    then fourier component of the strain is , @xmath111^{3/7}\\\\\\nonumber & & \\times\\left[\\frac{m}{m_\\odot}\\right]^{5/14}\\left[\\frac{{\\cal r}}{10^{-4}\\mbox{galaxy}^{-1}\\mbox{y}^{-1}}\\right]^{1/3 } n_0^{-1/3}\\left[\\frac{t_{\\rm obs}}{1~{\\rm month}}\\right]^{1/2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] comparing this with the expected sensitivity of the _ laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory _  ( ligo ) , the integration of one month is sufficient for the detection by the ligo ii facility  ( see shoemaker 2000 for the sensitivity curves of the ligo ) . as the dependence of the strain on @xmath104 is weak , the ligo ii can see the signal by the integration of one month , even if @xmath104 is reduced by two orders of magnitude",
    ". typical frequency of the source may be around @xmath112hz .      in this investigation",
    "we have applied the ` one zone ' approximation for simplicity .",
    "it means that the variables such as the stellar temperature or the rotational frequency are represented by some ` averaged ' values throughout the whole star .",
    "it premises that the viscosity works very efficiently compared to the time scale of the evolution of the system , typically about one year .",
    "the adjustment time scale of shear viscosity to smooth out the differential flow can be estimated for the neutron - neutron scattering dominant matter  @xcite as follows : @xmath113 assuming the stellar radius @xmath114 km and the averaged density @xmath115 , this amounts to @xmath116 y for @xmath117k .",
    "the rotation law of the star can deviate from the uniform rotation if this time scale is comparable or longer than the spin - up time . in that case ,",
    "behaviour of ( classical ) r - modes is uncertain and their characteristics may be drastically changed .",
    "we here _ assume _ that they can be approximated by some kind of average of the rotational angular velocity .",
    "the validity of this assumption should be confirmed elsewhere .",
    "it has been pointed out that in the hypercritical accretion process , explosive outflows driven by neutrino heating  @xcite or jet formation  @xcite may significantly reduce the mass attachment onto the neutron star .",
    "if it is the case , it is more probable that double neutron star binary systems will be formed through this channel . in such accretion inefficient situations ,",
    "the mass accretion rate @xmath18 is lower than the mass inflow rate @xmath19 from the envelope of the companion star .",
    "if the accretion inefficient flows behave similarly as the accretion efficient flows , evolution of the stars may be approximated by our models with lower @xmath2 and with a shorter duration , for the same value of @xmath19 .",
    "this results in smaller terminal rotational frequencies of the star .",
    "thus neutron stars which survive after mass accretion in this process would have even lower rotational frequencies .",
    "it is a surprise that the possibility of observation of gravitational waves from the systems seems unexpectedly large .",
    "this might encourage the ongoing detection experiments of gravitational waves .",
    "however we have to be careful in concluding the significance of the hypercritically accreting neutron stars as sources of gravitational waves .",
    "our analysis here might be too simplified and naive to get conclusive answers to the observational possibility .",
    "some simplified assumptions may influence the result significantly .",
    "for instance , more realistic behaviour of the accretion flow and the accreted matter may drastically change the efficiency of the accretion torque .",
    "angular momentum re - distribution in the realistic star may modify the r - mode characteristics significantly , which may affect the strength of the instability .",
    "thus the uncertainty included in our assumptions must be investigated more intensively in the future .",
    "we would like to express our gratitude to dr .",
