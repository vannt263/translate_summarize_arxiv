    "[ fig : ldc_and_marlin ]  ( a ) shows a schematic overview of the core software chain used for the studies of the large detector concept ( ) , one of the four current detector proposals for the  @xcite .",
    "this chain consists of two major parts :    1 .   the -based simulation of the detector response ,  @xcite .",
    "2 .   the digitisation of simulated data , event reconstruction as well as analysis provided by different modules of the  framework  @xcite .",
    "the event data is shipped through the software chain using  @xcite between different programs .",
    "geometry related data needed by the reconstruction is provided by the full detector simulation and can be accessed via  @xcite .",
    "is a modular c++ application framework based on  for the analysis and reconstruction of  data .  provides the main program with the event loop and a mechanism to call modules ,",
    "so called processors , to carry out specific tasks .",
    "these tasks can be as simple as filling histograms or as complex as a full event reconstruction .",
    "as an example , the full chain of an event reconstruction with processors for digitisation , tracking etc .",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ldc_and_marlin ]  ( b ) .",
    "the framework is reading data event by event creating an _ lcevent _ which is used to hand the data from processor to processor during a  run .",
    "lcevent _ consist of a set of collections holding specific objects like hits , tracks , cluster etc .",
    "processors only have the permission to read and add information to ensure the consistency of the data .",
    "program steering is done via an xml file allowing to hand over processor parameters , specifying the order of the processors or exchanging processors without recompilation .",
    "the package  is a specific set of processors for a complete event reconstruction system , based on the particle flow concept .",
    "version 00 - 02 contains the following processors :    tracker hit digitisation : : :    for the vertex system there are two different digitisers available .",
    "a    simple digitiser translates simulated tracker hits into tracker hits ,    without modifications .",
    "a more sophisticated digitiser takes the    deposition and transfer of charge in silicon as well as the geometry    into account  @xcite . in the time projection chamber ( tpc ) a gaussian    smearing of the simulated hit positions in    @xmath0-@xmath1 and @xmath2 is done to    account for the intrinsic chamber resolution .",
    "their parameters are    obtained from .",
    "calorimeter hit digitisation : : :    there are two different digitisers for the electromagnetic and    hadronic calorimeter ( ecal and hcal ) .",
    "the first provides calibration ,    low energy hit rejection and various sampling fractions for the    different regions of the calorimeter .",
    "the second has the capability to    merge neighboring cells into larger cells .",
    "this feature allows the    variation of the cell size in a simple way .",
    "both digitisers are able    to treat hits in analogue and digital calorimeters .",
    "tracking : : :    there are two tracking processors .",
    "the first is based on algorithms    taken from lep providing full tracking in the tpc with energy loss and    multiple scattering  @xcite .",
    "the hits of the inner silicon detectors    can be included in the track fit , using the tracks reconstructed in    the tpc as seeds .",
    "the second processor provides a stand - alone pattern    recognition procedure for the vertex detector  @xcite .",
    "clustering : : :    one of the central parts in the particle flow approach is a    sophisticated procedure to assign calorimeter hits to the proper    reconstructed particle and to minimise the `` confusion '' between    adjacent particles .",
    "this so - called clustering is done by the    `` trackwise clustering ''  @xcite algorithm .",
    "it only relies on spatial    information of the calorimeter hits with minimal dependence on the    detector geometry .",
    "it is applicable to digital and analogue    calorimeters as well as to different detector designs .",
    "particle flow : : :    s particle flow processor `` wolf '' extrapolates the tracks into the    calorimeter and matches them to clusters by a proximity cut taking    into account the detector geometry . in addition , a simple particle    identification is done by calculating the fraction of energy in the    ecal and the hcal . after that , a collection of reconstructed particles    is created where the four momenta of charged particles are determined    by the track parameters .",
    "the four momenta of neutral particles are    calculated from the clusters only .",
    "track and cluster cheater : : :    processors allowing the assignment of hits to tracks and clusters ,    using monte carlo information only , are provided . to obtain the track    parameters either a simple helix hypothesis is fitted to the tracker    hits or the information is taken from the monte carlo directly .",
    "analysis : : :    there are processors to calculate the thrust axis and value (  and    algorithm  @xcite ) as well as the sphericity and aplanarity of    an event . in addition , a multi - algorithm jet finding processor is    available  @xcite .",
    "calibration : : :    this processor calculates the calibration constants for the    calorimeter by the method proposed in  @xcite .",
    "it is based on the    energy conservation law giving an upper limit for the energy sum in    all the cells of the calorimeter .",
    "is based on the package  combining utility and helper classes and by the client - server based event display system .",
    ", a  implementation of the  interface , is available  @xcite . due to the modular structure and the well defined data structures , alternative algorithms ( ,  @xcite )",
    "can easily be included in .",
    "all software packages as well as more detailed documentation can be accessed via  @xcite .",
    "here the -based event reconstruction is tested and the dependence of the performance of the particle flow on basic geometric properties of the detector is studied . for this purpose the full detector simulation using  v05.04 and event reconstruction with",
    "is done with four classes ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 as well as @xmath6 ) of events at four different center - of - mass energies ( 91.2 , 360 , 500 and 1000  gev ) .",
    "four different layouts of the  and two values of the magnetic field have been chosen to optimise the detector . for the variation of the detector geometry two detector models , ldc00sc and ldc01sc provided by , with different sampling structures in the ecal",
    "are chosen .",
    "for each model two sizes of the tpc , determined by their outer radius ( @xmath7 ) and length from the nominal ip to the end plane of the tpc ( @xmath8 ) , are constructed  ( ( a ) and ( b ) in tab .  [",

    "[ tab : detectorgeometry ] summarises the available geometries .",
    "computing and data storage for simulation and reconstruction has been done using  resources .",
    "meta information about the simulated data as well as the logical names to access the files are available through a database  @xcite . for this study monte carlo information has been used to perform the pattern recognition in the tracking system .",
    "a helical fit is applied afterwards to obtain the track parameters .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : z0reco ]  ( a ) the distribution of the invariant mass of @xmath9 measured with @xmath10 events at @xmath11 for the detector ldc00sc  ( a ) with a magnetic field of 4  t is shown . due to the difference of the tails",
    "compared to a gaussian distribution the root - mean - square ( rms ) is not an appropriate measure of the width of the peak and therefore of the performance of the reconstruction .",
    "hence , ( 1 )  the rms is calculated with the bins around the maximum bin containing 90% of the events  ( @xmath12 )  @xcite , and ( 2 ) the sum of two gaussian functions , one for the central part and one for tails , is fitted to the mass distribution . the width of the central gaussian  ( @xmath13 ) is the measure of the width of the peak  ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : z0reco ]  ( a ) ) .",
    "the results of both methods are quoted to show the performance of the reconstruction .",
    "they also act as an indicator in the process of detector optimisation .",
    "the results for the geometry listed in tab .  [ tab : detectorgeometry ] are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : z0reco ]  ( b ) .    to study the performance at higher energies ,",
    "a simple analysis of @xmath14 at @xmath15 has been performed by calculating @xmath16 for each event . in the first part of @xmath17",
    "the energies of all reconstructed particles are added up , while in the second part the energy sum of all monte carlo particles which pass the acceptance cut @xmath18 and which are not neutrinos is calculated .",
    "this results in @xmath19  gev which is about a factor of two larger than the pure calorimeter resolution given by @xmath20  gev , where the first part of @xmath21 adds up the energy of all calorimeter cells  @xcite .",
    "one reason for this decrease of performance compared to @xmath22 at @xmath11 is the misassignment of hits due to overlaps of showers in the calorimeter .",
    "the -based simulation and reconstruction package  has shown that it is possible to reach energy resolutions of about 9  gev for @xmath23-events at @xmath15 following the particle flow concept  @xcite .",
    "for the determination of @xmath13 for @xmath10 at @xmath11  comes close to the performance goal of the jet energy resolution at the ilc ( @xmath24 corresponding to @xmath25 at @xmath26 ) but no significant dependence on the detector geometry is observed .",
    "the results of the @xmath12-method are considerably larger but are showing a clear dependence on the detector geometry .",
    "in addition , this dependence follows the expectation , i.e. the resolution increases with a larger detector and a larger magnetic field  ( see fig .",
