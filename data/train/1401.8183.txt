    "the discovery of the higgs boson @xcite is a dramatic confirmation of the stan- dard model ( sm ) . despite finding last missing piece of sm we are still looking for insight into the detailed mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking . in particular , within sm , the higgs mass receives large corrections leading to the hierarchy problem . for several resolutions of the hierarchy problem that have been put forward , like supersymmetry , large extra dimensions or composite structure the lhc found no hints so far .",
    "given such a scenario where new physics , stemming from e. g. supersym- metry , seems to be absent , one is lead to pursue alternative approaches to the hierarchy problem . here , we follow an idea first put forward by bardeen @xcite that in classically scale invariant ( si ) theories , scale invariance",
    "is broken by quantum corrections and quadratic divergence in fundamental scalar masses is a cutoff regularization artefact .",
    "all dimensionfull parameters in these the- ories , including the scalar masses , come from a single renormalization scale . as has been shown by coleman and e.  weinberg ( cw ) @xcite in order for this mechanism of mass generation to work within perturbation theory at least two bosonic degrees of freedom",
    "are needed .",
    "a seminal paper by gildener and s.  weinberg @xcite ( gw ) represents a first cohesive study of the cw mechanism for multiple scalars .",
    "classical scale invariance breaks by quantum anomaly yielding one pseudo- goldstone boson , the so - called scalon @xcite .",
    "the intriguing idea of identifying the scalon with the higgs particle requires additional bosonic degrees of freedom due to the large top quark mass . sprung by initial explorations @xcite many works",
    "have been put forward to realize this scenario . in order to compensate the large top contribution , extra bosons either have large couplings to the higgs @xcite or appear in large multiplets @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the cw mechanism can be applied in a new gauge sector where the scale gets transmitted to the sm through the higgs portal @xcite . for additional work on the si extensions of sm in different contexts ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "dark matter ( dm ) is another problem pressing us to extend the sm .",
    "classically si extensions of the sm with dm have been studied in inert higgs doublet model @xcite , @xmath6 vector dark matter @xcite , multiple scalar models @xcite and non - perturbative realizations of the hidden sector @xcite .",
    "si theories and the cw mechanism offer a possibility of a single origin of the electroweak symmetry breaking and the dark matter mass embodying the paradigm of the wimp miracle .",
    "this attractive picture is the subject of our work .",
    "we include si dark sector consisting of a new @xmath0 gauge group and @xmath1-charged scalar @xmath2 and majorana fermion @xmath3 .",
    "the effective scalar potential is dominated by the contributions of the new gauge boson and leads to the breaking of the dark gauge symmetry . via the higgs portal coupling the cw mechanism",
    "induces the breaking of electroweak symmetry . due to the residual @xmath4 symmetry",
    "the majorana fermion is stable and represents the dm candidate .",
    "we introduce @xmath0 gauge symmetry with doubly @xmath1-charged scalar @xmath2 and singly @xmath1-charged majorana fermion @xmath3 , both singlets under the sm gauge group .",
    "the scalar potential and dark yukawa term are @xmath7 @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a sm higgs doublet .",
    "the cw mechanism will be studied in the gw framework @xcite where quantum corrections are built on top of a flat direction in the tree - level potential giving mass to the scalon . assuming that both @xmath9 and @xmath2 acquire vacuum expectation values ( _ vevs _ ) @xmath10 the potential ( [ eq : pot ] ) has a flat direction when the couplings satisfy @xmath11 this is a dimensional transmutation , where one dimensionless coupling is traded for the physical scale of the model @xmath12 .    at the tree level the _ vevs _",
    "are given by @xmath13 scalar mass eigenstates are given by @xmath14 with mixing angle @xmath15 given by @xmath16 the tree - level masses of scalars are @xmath17 and @xmath1-gauge boson and fermion masses are @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the gauge coupling of the @xmath0 gauge symmetry .    to find the scalon mass we need the one - loop corrected potential along the flat direction which takes the following form @xcite @xmath20 where the radial field @xmath21 is defined through @xmath22 while the fields @xmath23 satisfy the constraint @xmath24 , with their _ vevs _ being @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "the coefficients @xmath27 and @xmath28 are given as @xcite @xmath29 @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the _ vev _ of the field @xmath21 .",
    "the mass of the scalon is given as @xmath32    the tree - level potential ( [ eq : pot ] ) in the mass eigenstate basis reads @xmath33 notice that the couplings @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 vanish at the tree level @xcite , independent of the particular value of the higgs portal coupling @xmath38 . in particular , the rigorous gw treatment for multiple scalar fields states that in the model studied here there are no higgs decays to the scalons on the tree level @xcite , contrary to @xcite .",
    "these points can be understood from the fact that flat direction of the tree - level potential defined by the _ vev _ of the unit vector field @xmath39 is also an eigenvector of the mass matrix with zero eigenvalue .",
    "therefore , if a term in the tree - level potential has more than two physical @xmath40 fields , or two @xmath40 fields and a dimensionfull coupling , the respective coefficient will be zero by construction .",
    "due to the remnant @xmath4 symmetry the majorana fermion @xmath3 is a dm candidate @xcite .",
    "our dm scenario assumes that @xmath3 is heavier than the scalar @xmath40 . in the early universe dm annihilates dominantly through the @xmath41-channel to @xmath42 pair , while contributions suppressed by a small mixing arise from @xmath43 and @xmath44 processes . at the time of the decoupling of the dm ,",
    "scalar @xmath40 is in the thermal equilibrium with the thermal bath of the sm particles through the higgs portal interaction . while our numerical analysis covers all the mentioned annihilation processes , it is instructive to show the dominant one .",
    "the thermally averaged @xmath45-wave annihilation cross section for @xmath46 is @xmath47 in our calculations we use the observed value for the dm relic density of the universe , @xmath48  @xcite .",
    "the model introduces four new parameters : gauge coupling @xmath19 , yukawa coupling @xmath49 and quartic scalar couplings @xmath38 and @xmath50 .",
    "the two constraints given by the higgs boson mass and the dark matter relic abundance leave two undetermined parameters chosen to be @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the mass of the @xmath1-boson has to be larger than @xmath53 gev to overcome the top quark contribution in order to have positive mass for the scalon .",
    "higgs searches at lep exclude scalon masses under 114 gev in our model .",
    "global fit to the current lhc data @xcite gives an upper bound of @xmath54 .",

    "the cw mechanism then requires that @xmath19 is increased to have a positive scalon mass .",
    "notice the key role played by the dm constraint ; keeping @xmath52 fixed and increasing @xmath51 leads to an increase of @xmath19 .",

    "for the minimal value @xmath66 gev , the dm constraint requires a relatively large yukawa coupling .",
    "the cw mechanism pulls @xmath19 in the same direction , which is the origin of @xmath19 being of order one .",
    "the perturbative restrictions provide upper bounds on masses in the hidden sector .",
    "we find the mass of the dm to be in the range from @xmath67 gev up to a few tev .",
    "postulating a hidden @xmath0 sector consisting of a doubly @xmath1-charged scalar and a singly charged majorana fermion we have examined a si extension of the sm with majorana fermion as a dm candidate . using the gw approach we have calculated masses of the new particles .",
    "the majorana fermion saturates the dm relic abundance via the @xmath68 annihilation .",
    "we predict the dm particle mass to be in the range from 500 gev to a few tev . while the lower bound",
    "is obtained by the lhc limit on @xmath25 , the upper bound is a conservative estimate set by moderate values of the dark gauge and yukawa couplings .",
    "the dm constraint plays an essential role here as it requires an appreciable yukawa coupling . in this sense",
    "similar results are obtained by @xcite where dm constraint enforces a gauge coupling of order one .",
    "a general statement may be drawn for a si extension of sm with a new gauge group ; the couplings in the hidden sector can be taken to be small provided the _ vev _ of the hidden scalar is large enough . however , identifying possible stable states of the hidden sector with dm particles , the scale set by cw mechanism requires moderate couplings in the hidden sector .",
