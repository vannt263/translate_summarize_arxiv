    "the hydrodynamic behavior beyond the shock is not rigorously established for either of the known examples with non - convex nor - concave flux . in contrary , the model we introduce here is fully covered under the hydrodynamic results of the literature .",
    "it is an _ attractive _ hyperbolic nearest neighbor particle system of just three possible states on a site which belongs to a more general family of misanthrope processes @xcite .",
    "one of the main conclusions is that , while hydrodynamics beyond the shock is rigorously established for this very simple attractive model , it also exhibits a non - trivial flux of both concave and convex pieces in some parameter range .",
    "we have combined recent results of pde solution theory ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "2 ) and @xcite ) with that of hydrodynamic limits established for general interacting particle systems @xcite to obtain rigorous results for the phase diagram of our model .",
    "we characterize all the possible cases of the riemann problem which can consist of coexisting shock wave and rarefaction fan regions in various orders depending on the density values we started off from .",
    "we also show how the whole phase diagram evolves as one varies the underlying parameter values of the system . at some cumbersome calculations we used the aid of the computer . finally , we mention that most of the results of the present paper originate from @xcite . as a nice add - on ,",

    "respectively . with parameter @xmath27",
    "we can adjust the symmetry of ( anti)particles jumping rate . in plain words , the above dynamics boils down to the following simple rules : two adjacent holes can produce an antiparticle - particle pair ( in that order ) with rate @xmath28 , antiparticles and particles can only hop to the negative and positive directions with rates @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively , and when a particle meets an antiparticle they annihilate each other with rate @xmath31 .",

    "2.2 ) , attractivity is equivalent to @xmath23 being monotone non - decreasing ( non - increasing ) in its first ( second ) variable , respectively .",
    "this means that our dynamics is attractive if and only if @xmath38 which we assume throughout the paper .",
    "( we do not expect different behavior in the non - attractive regime either but hydrodynamics beyond the shock is not rigorously established there and the interesting phenomena of this paper happens in the attractive parameter domain anyway . )    the model outlined above is the simplest member , after simple exclusion , of the family of _ misanthrope processes _ @xcite . in the above particular form , it first appeared in @xcite .",
    "first , we introduce the one - parameter family of product - form extremal stationary distributions of the above model . then in subsections [ sec : hydro ] and [",
    "sec : flux ] we establish some hydrodynamic properties of the model .",
    "these are then used in section [ sec : entropysols ] to determine the entropy solution of the riemann problem .    due to attractivity",
    "a very convenient feature of our model with rates is that it possesses _ product - form stationary distributions_. we define @xmath39 which is a bijection between the parameters @xmath40 $ ] and @xmath41 $ ] .",
