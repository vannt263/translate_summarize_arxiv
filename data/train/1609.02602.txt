    "indeed , the subsequent class i and ii phases are respectively marked by a decline in the rate of accretion from the surrounding natal environment , and its eventual cessation @xcite .",

    "our aim is to explain the global behavior of disks in which the mass accretion rate is predominantly set by the action of gravitational torques acting through most of the disk .",
    "other accretion mechanisms may be necessary in the innermost sub - au regions of the disk , possibly introducing short - term time variability .",
    "the above studies typicaly invoke the magnetorotational instability @xcite as the transport mechanism in the hot inner disk , however it is worthwhile to keep in mind that the region @xmath17 from the star is generally thought to be the outflow driving zone ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) from which significant amounts of angular momentum and mass are carried away from the disk .",
    "we construct a model for the temporal evolution of self - gravitating , axisymmetric thin disks on a radial grid with logarithmic spacing , and consisting of @xmath18 annular elements .",

    "* ) . however , the central point - mass dominates the system s gravitational potential , with the contribution from the disk increasing @xmath24 only slightly . for the sake of computational convenience",
    "we thus adopt a simplified procedure by approximating the total gravitating mass at a radius @xmath19 to be @xmath25 in which @xmath26 denotes the innermost radius of the simulation domain ( and the assumed disk inner edge ) .",
    "the action of ( [ eqn : diskevolutioneqn ] ) is to transport material within the disk to ever smaller radii , while a small fraction of disk material is simultaneously transported to larger radii , thereby preserving the system s total angular momentum . for these simulations ,",
    "the disk edge @xmath27 is always @xmath28 , the computational domain s outer boundary .",
    "thus , material that exits the simulation can only do so through @xmath26 .",
    "we impose a free * outflow * boundary condition there , and any material crossing @xmath26 is assumed to be accreted onto the central protostar , which we model as a point mass .",
    "temporal evolution of the disk is governed by the viscous stresses acting on the disk material .",
    "these stresses are typically subsumed into a dimensionless parameter @xmath29 that characterizes the efficiency of angular momentum transport .",
    "@xcite developed the most commonly invoked prescription of this kind , proposing a turbulent kinematic viscosity of the form @xmath30 which is the product of the turbulent velocity @xmath31 and the size @xmath32 of the largest eddies in the turbulent pattern .",
    "as turbulence is quickly dissipated by shocks in a highly supersonic flow , the turbulent velocity is often taken to be roughly equal to the local sound speed of the disk medium , @xmath33 .",
    "an upper limit to the size of the largest eddies that form can similarly be argued to be roughly equal to the disk half - thickness @xmath34 ; hence @xmath35 where we have used @xmath36 , and imposed that the disk be everywhere in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium . taken together , these arguments imply that @xmath29 should be less than unity .",
    "determinations based on measurements of the accretion rates from disks surrounding young stellar objects in the taurus complex suggest that @xmath37 @xcite . however , if and why @xmath29 should be spatially uniform and constant in time remains unclear .    one mechanism that may act as an effective @xmath29-viscosity is the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) .",
    "@xcite have demonstrated that a weak magnetic field can make an otherwise hydrodynamically stable disk become unstable to the mri .",
    "simulations in ideal magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) find that the nonlinear outcome of mri can amplify and sustain turbulence that can then lead to angular momentum transport @xcite .",
    "however , in a largely neutral medium ( such as in a protostellar disk ) the ionization fraction must be large enough for the neutral - ion collision frequency to be greater than the local epicyclic frequency @xcite .",
    "many studies have been performed to determine in which regions of protostellar disks the mri may be active @xcite . for example , @xcite find that the mri can be active at distances greater than 5 au from the central star , while @xcite finds that the disk midplane is largely inactive to the mri after accounting for the effect of stellar winds and magnetic mirroring of cosmic rays , in addition to using a different critical electron fraction for the magnetic coupling .",
    "simulations of the mri with non - ideal mhd are very sensitive to ionization structure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "hence the determination of an effective @xmath29 for the mri in local simulations , let alone for a global disk model or for different evolutionary stages , is hardly established .",
    "* and references therein ) suggest a value for @xmath29 anywhere in the range of @xmath38 . when using @xmath29 as a comparator in this study we use @xmath39 , based on observational constraints ( hartmann et al . , 1998 )",
    ".    gravitational torques may represent an alternative source for angular momentum transport in cold and/or massive disks .",
    "using self - consistent cooling , @xcite showed that an @xmath29 prescription based on the gravitational instability agrees with the @xcite description very well , which assumes that the viscous heating is locally balanced by the cooling .",
    "@xcite have also used smoothed particle hydrodynamics to show that these disks often possess tightly wound spiral arms that can be approximated with a local treatment . here",
    "we consider a perturbation in an otherwise axisymmetric thin disk , which has the form of an annulus of width @xmath40 and increased local mass @xmath41 ( e.g. , the formation of a spiral arm ) .",
    "the growth condition for a perturbation depends on whether its self - gravity is greater than the tidal acceleration acting on it .",
    "that is , @xmath42 a natural length scale thus emerges , in excess of which perturbations of this nature are stabilized by their rotation , @xmath43 furthermore , with the assumption of vertical hydrostatic equilibrium , the disk self - gravity is supported by gas pressure in the vertical direction .",
    "this additional constraint implies @xmath40 must be at least larger than the disk half - thickness @xmath34 , @xmath44 @xcite originally formulated these arguments , summarizing the instability criterion as : @xmath45 this condition can additionally be rephrased in terms of the disk mass .",
    "multiplying equation ( [ eqn : toomresqcriterion ] ) by the square of the disk outer radius , @xmath46 , and then approximating the disk mass as @xmath47 , toomre s @xmath3 criterion implies @xmath48 from this statement one can conclude that provided the disk is thin , even a relatively low - mass disk will exhibit the effects of self - gravity .",
    "disks of this variety may not be uncommon , possibly forming during the earliest stages of star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the importance of self - gravity in providing an effective way of redistributing angular momentum at the earliest stages of star formation has been recently recognized @xcite .",
    "@xcite noted that gravitational torques could be parameterized as an effective kinematic viscosity , constructed dimensionally using the length scales arising from toomre s analysis : the maximum size of the region over which angular momentum is transferred being roughly @xmath49 , together with a time - scale of approximately @xmath50 , produces an effective kinematic viscosity of the form @xmath51 this is clearly analogous to the standard @xmath29 prescription of @xcite with @xmath52 ( see equation ( [ eqn : alphaviscosity ] ) ) .",
    "additionally , by using equation ( [ eqn : toomresqcriterion ] ) we can also write @xmath53 hence , a convenient feature of parameterizing the gravitational torques via equation ( [ eqn : convenientnu ] ) is that we need not explicitly evaluate the energy equation during the disk evolution .",
    "this allows us to study the evolution of the disk while circumventing the complex issues related to the disk thermodynamics .",
    "nevertheless , to validate the consistency of our results with existing 1d simulation work ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as higher dimensional models , such as the 2 + 1d models of @xcite , we do follow the temperature evolution of the disk implicitly .",

    "can therefore be expressed as @xcite @xmath58 here , @xmath59 is the sound speed corresponding to a medium of predominantly molecular hydrogen ( with an admixture of helium ) that is isothermal with @xmath57 . for the ratio of the specific heats we used @xmath60 .    the gas temperature , via the ideal gas equation of state @xmath61 , is then simply @xmath62,\\ ] ] where @xmath63 is the mean molecular mass ( which we take to be 2.36 ) , @xmath64 is the proton mass , and @xmath65 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "angular momentum transport by gravitational instability ( or more appropriately , gravitational torques , as being described herein ) has been shown to remain effective in the regime of @xmath66 @xcite . in their 2006 study",
    "specifically , it was found that radial profiles of the toomre @xmath3 parameter were both near - uniform and noticeably larger during periods of quiescence in the mass accretion rate , and never falling below @xmath67 during this phase .",
    "although the persistence of gravitational instabilities is not usually expected for these values of @xmath3 , their 2 + 1d simulations revealed that weak spiral structures formed early on in the formation of the disk were then sustained by a swing amplification mechanism@xcite .",
    "in fact , strong observational evidence for spiral structure has actually been found in several - million year old disks such as hd 100546 @xcite , ab aurigae @xcite , and hd 135344b @xcite , all in support of this conjecture .",

    "in this paper , we have shown that the observed power law correlation between mass accretion rate @xmath0 and protostellar mass @xmath1 can be explained within the framework of gravitational  torque",
    " driven transport .",
    "we parameterize the effects of the gravitational torques as an effective kinematic viscosity using toomre s @xmath3 criterion @xcite , noting that this prescription resembles but also differs from the classical @xmath29 model of @xcite .",
    "we carry out more than 200 individual simulations of protostellar disks in order to examine the time evolution of their mass accretion rates in the @xmath131 plane .",
    "the rates associated with a particular protostellar mass agree with those inferred from observational studies of t tauri disks across a broad spectrum of protostellar masses .",
    "the observed scatter in @xmath0 arises naturally as a result of the temporal evolution of the protostar - disk system through this plane .",
    "we are able to use a simple statistical argument , resampling our simulations onto the initial mass function of @xcite , to show that even with limited sampling , our simulation results are sufficiently robust to be able to reproduce the observed correlation .",
    "the initial disk masses presented in this paper are somewhat greater than is often reported in the literature ( by a factor of @xmath132 , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , current estimates for disk masses based on dust emission may have been systematically underestimated @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , as the efficacy of our transport mechanism is dependent on disk mass , it is possible that that additional physics may be required at late times to remove the remaining disk material within observed disk lifetimes @xcite .",
    "conversely , there is growing evidence that some disks may persist for several myr and have noticeable spiral structure , arcs , and gaps that may be indicative of gravitational instability @xcite .",
    "one way to understand this is by invoking gas accretion on to the disks for an extended period of several myr @xcite",
    ". accretion on to the disk is not a part of our current model and is a subject of future work .",
    "in a recent paper , @xcite offer a physically different model explanation .",
    "in their view , @xmath0 is initially mass independent , and declines in a self - similar manner with a somewhat different power law index than in our model , due to the use of an @xmath29-viscosity .",
    "mass accretion is then quenched when a model wind mass loss rate ( that depends on the x - ray luminosity of the protostar ) equals the mass accretion rate .",
    "the physical view here is that the observed mass - dependent x - ray luminosity sets the @xmath15 relation by reducing the accretion rate when it drops to the level of the wind mass loss rate .",
    "mathematically however , both models depend partially upon a bimodal mass accretion rate history .",
    "it is only the physical explanation of the two phases , and the specific mathematical shape of their curves , that differ .",
    "the observed correlation in @xmath15 may therefore be fit by a variety of models that have common mathematical elements , but differ substantially enough in their physics that they will hopefully lead to interesting observational comparator tests in the future .",
