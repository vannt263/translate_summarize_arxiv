    "for @xmath197 there is an example in @xcite of 4-dimensional right - angled coxeter group which is relatively hyperbolic and has maximal abelian subgroup of dimension 2 . here in this section",
    "we present an example of relatively hyperbolic coxeter group with fundamental domain a 12-cube with maximal flats of dimension 6.the idea is that from the diagram for the right - angled cube consisting of @xmath198 vertical edges each labeled @xmath6 we add edges between some vertices so that the link @xmath17 of new coxeter group is the same type as for the right - angled cube .",

    "one class of examples was introduced recently by r. greene in @xcite .",
    "his technique can be applied to produce similar example for relatively hyperbolic coxeter groups .",
    "here is a rough idea how to produce such an example .",
    "let @xmath35 be an octahedron , @xmath206 be the product of @xmath35 crossed an interval . if we cone off the two copies @xmath207 of @xmath35 in @xmath208 we get a 3-sphere .",
    "we will triangulate this sphere so that one octahedron , @xmath209 , is remained ( this will be the nerve of a codimension 1 flat ) and there is no other empty square except for the ones in @xmath209 . for",
    "the cone on @xmath210 , apply przytycki - swiatkowski @xcite subdivision process .",
    "the triangles in @xmath210 are subdivided and there are new vertices in @xmath210 , we connect the vertices in @xmath209 with appropriate new vertices in @xmath210 to have a triangulation of 3-sphere .",
    "you can check that this triangulation does nt have any empty squares rather than the ones in @xmath209 .",
    "and so this is the nerve of a relatively hyperbolic right - angled coxeter group of type @xmath0 with one codimension 1 flat .",
