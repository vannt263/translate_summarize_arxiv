    "introduced here is an extended petviashvili family of methods , suitable for the numerical approximation of solutions of systems of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a nonsingular real @xmath2 matrix and @xmath3 is a nonlinear function that consists of homogeneous functions with several degrees . the paper will formulate the methods , analyze conditions for the convergence and explore their application in some examples of generation of solitary waves .    the iterative techniques presented here are somehow related to the so - called petviashvili method , @xcite .",
    "this method is usually applied for the numerical resolution of systems of the form ( [ lab11 ] ) , but when @xmath4 is homogeneous with degree @xmath5 such that @xmath6 .",
    "it is formulated in the following form : the so - called _ stabilizing factor _",
    "@xmath7 is defined .",
    "then , given an initial iteration @xmath8 , the step @xmath9 is implemented as @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the euclidean inner product and @xmath12 is a free parameter .",
    "the petviashvili method ( [ lab13 ] ) is a fixed - point algorithm that originally appeared to generate numerically lump solitary wave profiles of the kp - i equation , @xcite .",
    "it is usually included as one of the methods for the numerical generation of solitary waves , a family that many other techniques belong to , such as shooting methods , some variants of newton s method , @xcite , variational procedures , @xcite , squared operator methods , @xcite or imaginary - time evolution methods , @xcite . from the original paper @xcite ,",
    "several convergence studies and generalizations of the method have been done , @xcite .",
    "as analyzed in @xcite , from the point of view of the convergence , the petviashvili method is a modification of the classical fixed - point algorithm @xmath13 which overcomes the harmful directions for which ( [ lab14 ] ) is not convergent . for systems ( [ lab11 ] ) with @xmath4 homogeneous of degree @xmath5 ( @xmath6 )",
    ", it turns out that @xmath14 is an eigenvalue of the iteration matrix @xmath15 at a fixed point @xmath16 with an eigenvector given by @xmath16 .",
    "( the prime denotes the jacobian of @xmath4 . )",
    "then the iteration matrix of ( [ lab13 ] ) consists of a deflaction that moves this eigenvalue to some below one in magnitude ( which is zero for the optimal choice of the parameter @xmath12 ) and preserves the rest of the spectrum of @xmath17 in ( [ lab14b ] ) .",
    "thus , if @xmath14 is the only eigenvalue of @xmath17 with modulus greater than one , the petviashvili method leads to convergence .    introduced here is a family of iterative techniques , based on the philosophy of the petviashvili method , that can be applied to systems ( [ lab11 ] ) , but where @xmath4 is a combination of homogeneous functions with different degree and the iteration matrix ( [ lab14b ] ) contains one eigenvalue with modulus greater than one ( and , consequently the classical fixed - point algorithm does not converge ) .",
    "this type of systems appears in many contexts of interest , with particular emphasis on the numerical generation of solitary waves . for this kind of systems , and",
    "contrary to the homogeneous case , the fixed point is not an eigenvector of ( [ lab14b ] ) anymore .",
    "however , if ( [ lab14b ] ) still contains an eigenvalue with modulus above one , the strategy of the petviashvili method , in order to reduce the magnitude of the eigenvalues , is still applicable , leading to modified versions of the algorithm",
    ". this paper concerns the case of nonlinear terms containing different homogeneities , while the possibility of adapting the idea to general nonlinearities will be a subject of future work .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "section [ sec2 ] is devoted to the description of the methods and the structure of the corresponding iteration matrix at the fixed point . for simplicity",
    ", the study will be done for a nonlinearity @xmath4 in ( [ lab11 ] ) , consisting of two different homogeneous terms .",
    "the generalization of these algorithms to more than two homogeneities will be done in the expected way .",
    "the form of the iteration matrix allows to design the methods with the goal of transforming ( [ lab14b ] ) to get convergence .",
    "several examples to illustrate this are shown in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "they include the generation of ground state solutions in different nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) models , with and without potentials and of solitary wave solutions of extended versions of classical nonlinear dispersive equations in water waves .",
    "we assume that in ( [ lab11 ] ) the nonlinear term can be written as @xmath18 where for @xmath19 , @xmath20 is an homogeneous function with degree @xmath21 such that @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the following methods for the numerical approximation of ( [ lab11 ] ) are proposed .",
    "we consider @xmath24 functions @xmath25 , homogeneous of degree @xmath26 and generate a sequence of the form @xmath27 in the case that @xmath4 contains more than two homogeneities @xmath28 with @xmath29 and homogeneous function of degree @xmath30 and @xmath31 , then the corresponding formulation must substitute ( [ lab22 ] ) by @xmath32 for some @xmath24 homogeneous functions @xmath33 .",
    "the original idea of the petviashvili method is somehow present in ( [ lab22 ] ) and ( [ lab23 ] ) : the functions @xmath34 could play the role of stabilizing factors and this would guide their choice .",
    "first , it is indeed required that the fixed points of the system @xmath35 contain fixed points of ( [ lab11 ] ) .",
    "therefore , if @xmath16 solves ( [ lab11 ] ) , then @xmath36 . inversely , if @xmath37 , defined by ( [ lab22 ] ) ( or ( [ lab23 ] ) ) converges to some @xmath38 , then @xmath38 must be a solution of ( [ lab11 ] ) .",
    "note that ( [ lab22 ] ) can be written as a fixed - point algorithm for the iteration function @xmath39 and the associated iteration matrix at @xmath16 has the form @xmath40 where @xmath17 is the iteration matrix ( [ lab14b ] ) of the classical fixed - point algorithm ( [ lab14 ] ) .",
    "* if we take : @xmath41 for some @xmath12 and where @xmath42 is the stabilizing factor ( [ stb ] ) , then the resulting method ( [ lab22 ] ) consists of implementing the petviashvili scheme ( [ lab13 ] ) with more general nonlinearity ( [ lab21 ] ) . * the choice @xmath43 for some @xmath44 , can be seen as a generalization of ( [ lab24 ] ) .",
    "it also looks natural to think that the choice of the parameters @xmath45 should have to do with the degrees of homogeneity @xmath46 and @xmath47 . in this sense , we remind that in the case of the petviashvili method , the optimal choice of @xmath12 is @xmath48 , where @xmath5 is the degree of homogeneity of the nonlinear term , @xcite .    as mentioned in the introduction , the petviashvili method is mainly used in systems ( [ lab11 ] ) where @xmath4 is an homogeneous term with degree of magnitude above one .",
    "this kind of systems is very frequent in the numerical generation of solitary wave profiles in nonlinear dispersive equations .",
    "this is the reason , in our opinion , for the relative popularity of the method in that research area .",
    "( the origin of the method is also there , @xcite . )",
    "these special systems have the key property that the degree of homogeneity is an eigenvalue of the iteration matrix ( [ lab14b ] ) of the classical fixed - point algorithm at the fixed point @xmath16 and with @xmath16 itself as eigenvector .",
    "thus , the effect of the petviashvili method is filtering the eigenspace given by @xmath16 .",
    "now , in the case of systems ( [ lab11 ] ) satisfying ( [ lab21 ] ) , the presence of the fixed point @xmath49 as an eigenvector of the iteration matrix ( [ lab14b ] ) is not guaranteed .",
    "this means that any @xmath50 is not necessarily an eigenvalue .",
    "the following example illustrates the typical case .",
    "we consider the generation of localized ground states for nonlinear schrdinger models of the form @xmath51 where @xmath52 are real constants .",
    "the physical context where ( [ lab26 ] ) appears and several results of existence of localized ground state solutions @xmath53 , can be seen in @xcite and references therein .",
    "the equation for @xmath54 is of the form @xmath55 explicit formulas are known in some cases .",
    "for example , when @xmath56 , we have , @xcite @xmath57 equation ( [ lab27 ] ) is now discretized .",
    "we consider the corresponding periodic problem on a sufficiently long interval @xmath58 and discretize ( [ lab27 ] ) with fourier collocation techniques , @xcite .",
    "the discrete system will have the form ( [ lab11 ] ) with @xmath59 in ( [ lab27b ] ) , @xmath60 is the @xmath2 identity matrix , @xmath61 is the pseudospectral differentiation matrix and @xmath62 stands for an approximation to the values of the exact solution @xmath63 at the grid points @xmath64 on @xmath58 .",
    "the dots in @xmath4 stand for the hadamard product of the vectors .",
    "this fourier collocation procedure will be taken as the discretization method for all the experiments in the present paper .",
    ".six largest magnitude eigenvalues of the iteration matrices for ( [ lab27 ] ) in the cubic - quintic case ( @xmath65 ) , at the exact solution ( [ exact ] ) .",
    "they correspond to : ( [ lab14b ] ) ( first column ) ; ( [ lab28 ] ) , ( [ lab24 ] ) with @xmath66 ( second column ) ; ( [ lab28 ] ) , ( [ lab24 ] ) with @xmath67 ( third column ) ; ( [ lab28 ] ) , ( [ lab25 ] ) with @xmath68 ( fourth column ) .",
    "[ tav_1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the convergence of the method is illustrated by the following results .",
    "table [ tav_5 ] shows the six largest magnitude eigenvalues of the iteration matrix ( [ lab14b ] ) of the classical fixed point algorithm ( [ lab14 ] ) and of the iteration matrix ( [ lab28 ] ) , ( [ lab25 ] ) with @xmath69 , both at the last computed iterate @xmath70 .",
    "the results correspond to the two values of @xmath71 considered , near to two types of bifurcation : a symmetry breaking pitchfork bifurcation ( @xmath72 ) and a saddle - node bifurcation ( @xmath73 ) , @xcite . in both cases , the presence of a _",
    "unique _ eigenvalue of magnitude above one in the spectrum of @xmath17 ( first and third columns ) explains the nonconvergence of the classical fixed - point algorithm ( [ lab14 ] )",
    ". the extended method ( [ lab28 ] ) , ( [ lab25 ] ) modifies the spectrum , in such a way that the harmful eigenvalue is ruled out and the rest of the spectrum is retained to be below one in magnitude .",
    "the resulting profiles where the iteration matrices are evaluated at are displayed in figures [ fexample_6](a ) ( for @xmath72 ) and ( c ) ( for @xmath73 ) .",
    "they are positive and symmetric , @xcite .",
    "the convergence is also confirmed by the next two experiments .",
    "figure [ fexample_6a ] shows the behaviour of the residual error ( [ res ] ) , where @xmath1 and @xmath4 are now given by ( [ lab32 ] ) . in both cases ( @xmath72 for figure [ fexample_6a](a ) and",
    "@xmath73 for figure [ fexample_6a](b ) ) the decrease of the residual is observed , with a higher computational cost in the second case .",
    "a final test for the accuracy of the computed waves is shown in figures [ fexample_7 ] and [ fexample_10 ] .",
    "the final iterates have been taken as initial conditions of a time - stepping code to integrate ( [ lab31 ] ) numerically .",
    "figure [ fexample_7 ] illustrates the evolution of the resulting numerical solution , which is displayed ( with the real and imaginary parts in a separate way ) at different times for the case @xmath72 .",
    "figure [ fexample_10 ] corresponds to @xmath73 . in both cases",
    ", the profile evolves as a localized ground state with a high accuracy .",
    "this is also confirmed by figure [ fexample_10b ] , which shows the evolution of the angular velocity  of the numerical solution .",
    "it is clearly observed that the computed quantity evolves to the corresponding theoretical phase speed @xmath71 of the ground state ( @xmath72 in figure [ fexample_10b](a ) and @xmath72 in figure [ fexample_10b](b ) ) .      in this last example , a generalized nls equation ( gnls ) with cubic , quintic and seventh power nonlinearities @xmath74 and a real constant @xmath75 .",
    "the equation ( [ gnls2 ] ) , with its physical motivation , is also studied in @xcite ( see also references therein ) and the same elements have been taken here .",
    "in particular , @xmath76 is the asymmetric double - well potential @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "localized ground state solutions @xmath79 now satisfy @xmath80 ) for the corresponding fourier collocation approximation is @xmath81 observe that now the nonlinearity in ( [ lab41 ] ) contains three homogeneous terms with degrees @xmath82 .",
    "our aim here is analyzing the performance of the extended fixed - point algorithm ( [ lab23 ] ) with @xmath83 @xmath84 for some factors @xmath85 .",
    "in particular , the experiments are focused on the extension of ( [ lab25 ] ) by taking @xmath86 where @xmath42 is the stabilizing factor ( [ stb ] ) .",
    "other alternatives are indeed possible .    in equation ( [ gnls2 ] ) , @xcite , transcritical bifurcations of solitary waves is found at @xmath87 with a bifurcation point at @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is given by ( [ power ] ) . the extended method ( [ lab22e ] ) , ( [ lab25e ] )",
    "has been checked close to this point ; explicitly , solitary wave profiles have been generated for the values @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
