    "the lack of robust redshift information is one of the outstanding problems in understanding the nature of the presumed high - redshift galaxies identified in blank - field sub - mm and mm wavelength surveys .    in paperi of this series",
    "@xcite we described monte carlo simulations of 250500@xmath0 m surveys from the balloon - borne telescope blast @xcite and the spire instrument on the herschel satellite , as well as longer - wavelength ground - based 850@xmath0 m surveys with scuba .",
    "these simulations included a detailed treatment of the observational and evolutionary model - dependent errors .",
    "the sub - mm colours of galaxies derived from these mock surveys demonstrated that it will be possible to derive photometric redshifts , with a conservative r.m.s .",
    "accuracy of @xmath5 , for thousands of optically - obscured galaxies .",
    "thus we can look forward to breaking the redshift deadlock which , at the moment , prevents a reliable estimate of the evolutionary history of a population that contributes a significant fraction ( @xmath6 per cent for @xmath7  mjy ) to the sub - mm background ( hughes et al .",
    "1998 , smail et al . 2002 ) .    in this second paper",
    "we apply the same monte carlo photometric - redshift technique to the existing fir ",
    "radio multi - wavelength data for 77 sources first identified in blank - field 850@xmath0 m ( scuba ) and 1.2 mm ( mambo ) surveys .",
    "we calculate the redshift probability distributions of the individual sub - mm and mm galaxies , taking into account observational and model - dependent uncertainties , and thus provide a measurement of the cumulative redshift distribution for the blank - field sub - mm galaxy population .",
    "this redshift distribution is completely insensitive to ambiguities in the identification of the optical counterparts .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : section  2 gives a brief description of the monte carlo simulations , the method to derive photometric redshifts from the radio  sub - mm  fir colours of galaxies drawn from the mock catalogues , and the caveats and advantages of this technique over other redshift indicators ; section  3 presents individual redshift probability distributions for blank - field sub - mm galaxies .",
    "in addition , we include a brief discussion of the photometric redshifts for radio and fir - selected galaxies subsequently detected at 850@xmath0 m .",
    "furthermore , we determine the accuracy of our method through the comparison of the photometric redshifts for those 8 sub - mm sources that have published rest - frame optical spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "finally , in section 3 we present the cumulative redshift distribution of the blank - field sub - mm population .",
    "section  4 discusses the likelihood of a radio detection of previously detected blank - field sub - mm sources , based only on the known dispersion of the 850@xmath0m/1.4ghz colour in starburst galaxies , radio - quiet agn and ulirgs , which are believed to be representative of the high-@xmath1 sub - mm galaxy population .",
    "section  5 describes how the determination of redshift probability distributions for individual sub - mm galaxies is motivating the efforts to provide spectroscopic confirmation of the redshifts at mm and cm wavelengths .",
    "ultimately , these spectroscopic redshifts will accurately calibrate the photometric redshifts derived from rest - frame fir  radio - wavelength data .",
    "appendix  a contains the complete catalogue of spectral energy distributions ( seds ) and redshift distributions derived in this paper .",
    "the monte carlo simulations described in this paper produce the redshift probability distribution for an individual galaxy .",
    "the advantage of this technique , compared to the popular maximum - likelihood methods , is that it provides more information than a simple estimate of the first and second moments of the redshift distributions .",
    "a detailed description of the technique can be found in paperi ; we only offer a summary here .",
    "hereafter we will refer to a galaxy detected in a scuba or mambo survey as a _ sub - mm _ galaxy , and a sub - mm galaxy generated in the monte carlo simulations as a _ mock _ galaxy .",
    "we choose an evolutionary model for the @xmath8 m luminosity function that fits the observed 850@xmath0 m number - counts . under this model , and assuming a sub - mm survey of @xmath910 deg@xmath10 , we generate a catalogue of 60@xmath0 m luminosities and redshifts . randomly selected template seds are drawn from a library of local starbursts , ulirgs and agn , to provide fir ",
    "radio fluxes , and hence colours , for this mock catalogue .",
    "the fluxes of the mock galaxies include both photometric and calibration errors , consistent with the quality of the observational data for the sub - mm galaxy detected in a particular survey .",
    "we reject from the catalogue those mock galaxies that do not respect the detection thresholds and upper - limits of the particular sub - mm galaxy under analysis . in this paper the redshift probability distribution of a sub - mm galaxy",
    "is calculated as the normalized distribution of the redshifts of the mock galaxies in the reduced catalogue , weighted by the likelihood of identifying the colours and fluxes of each mock galaxy with those of the sub - mm galaxy in question .",
    "thus , we also take into account as much prior information on the sub - mm galaxy population ( and their uncertainties ) as possible . for example",
    ", we consider uncertainties in the sub - mm galaxy number counts , their favoured evolutionary models , the luminosity function of dusty galaxies , lensing by a foreground magnifying cluster , etc . in the case",
    "that the sub - mm galaxy is identified as a lensed source , then the mock catalogue is also amplified by the appropriate factor , allowing intrinsically fainter objects to be introduced into the reduced catalogue , using the same observational measurement errors .",
    "we adopt a flat , @xmath11-dominated cosmological model ( @xmath12  kms@xmath13mpc@xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) . to quantify the sensitivity of the individual redshift distributions on the assumed evolutionary history of the sub - mm galaxy population , we consider six different models that are able to reproduce the observed @xmath16 m number - counts within the uncertainties",

    "an extended library of seds ( compared to paper i ) is used in the monte carlo simulations .",
    "the library contains 20 starbursts , ulirgs and agn that have been either extensively mapped at fir ",
    "radio wavelengths , or galaxies that are sufficiently distant that single - beam photometric observations measure the total flux : m82 , ngc3227 , ngc2992 , ngc4151 , ngc7469 , ngc7771 , ngc1614 , izw1 , mkn231 , arp220 , mkn273 , ngc6240 , ugc5101 , iras10214 + 4724 , iras05189@xmath382524 , iras08572 + 3915 , iras15250 + 3609 , iras12112 + 0305 , iras14348@xmath381447 and cloverleaf .",
    "this selection has the important consequence of reducing any dispersion in the seds due to aperture effects .",
    "a continuum sed that includes synchrotron and free - free emission in the radio to mm regime , and thermal emission from dust grains in the mm - to fir regime , is fitted to the observational data ( chapin et al .",
    "the luminosities and temperatures of the dust that dominates the rest - frame fir emission are evenly distributed in the ranges @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "half of the galaxies in the sed library used in the derivation of photometric redshifts in this paper are in common with those considered by yun & carilli ( 2002 ) , hereafter yc02 .",
    "the temperature range covered by our sample of galaxies ( @xmath41k , median 41k ) is broader than that of yc02 due to the increased fraction of cooler sources , and is , for the same reason , colder than those of well - studied ulirgs ( @xmath42k , median 60k , klaas et al .",
    "2001 ) . despite the similar temperatures of our sample to late - type galaxies selected at 60@xmath0 m ( @xmath43k , median 35k ) , drawn from the slugs catalogue of dunne et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , the shapes of the seds in our library differ significantly from the local galaxies in the slugs .",
    "this illustrates an important point : it is the shapes of the seds , and not the derived dust temperatures , that influence the estimated photometric redshifts . given the limited fir  sub - mm data , there is a degeneracy between the dust temperatures , grain emissivity index ( @xmath44 ) , source - size ( @xmath45 ) and optical depth ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "this makes it possible to fit a single observed sed with a broad range of temperature , by tuning the choice of @xmath47 and @xmath46 ( e.g. hughes et al 1993 ) .",
    "it remains unclear whether the lower - luminosity , local galaxies in the slugs are closely related to the blank - field scuba population which have rest - frame fir luminosities @xmath48 , assuming the sub - mm galaxies lie at @xmath49 .",
    "the claim that cold seds match the number - counts in hydrodynamical cosmological simulations ( _ e.g. _ fardal et al .",
    "2002 ) should not be a basis for favouring cold seds , since a different evolutionary model with warmer seds can fit the counts equally well .",
    "the strongest caveat in any photometric redshift analysis is the validity of the assumption that the sed templates of local starbursts , ulirgs and agn are good analogs of the high - redshift sub - mm galaxy population .",
    "it is not until future rest - frame fir  sub - mm observations from sensitive balloon - borne or satellite experiments ( paperi ) accurately measure the variety of seds present in the sub - mm galaxy population , and spectroscopic redshifts for these are available , that it will possible to improve the error estimates presented in this paper .",
    "the technique adopted in this paper differs philosophically from those developed in other photometric - redshift studies .",
    "our redshift estimates do not rely on the match of the observed data to a single template sed , and our errors are not drawn from the departure of other local seds from the adopted standard template , which has become the common practice ( carilli & yun 1999 , 2000 , hereafter referred to as cy99 , cy00 ; gear et al .",
    "2000 ; yc02 ) .",
    "instead , we allow the test galaxies to be matched against the whole variety of template seds that can be detected at any given redshift .",
    "this point should be emphasized , since although we assign our template seds at random , not all sed shapes ( scaled to the same fir luminosity ) are detected with equal probability at any given redshift and wavelength .",
    "the redshift distributions derived in this paper are often asymmetric , and broader than those inferred from the single sed template analysis . despite the efforts of some authors to include realistic error - bars in their single - template estimates , we consider these to have been underestimated : error bars derived from 68% of the galaxies in a template catalogue , is not equivalent to the 68% dispersion in the fluxes that the whole catalogue can create , since some of the outliers contribute very significantly to the departures from the mean .",
    "our redshift estimation method also has the advantage of including a common - sense evaluation of whether a source at a given redshift is simultaneously consistent with the observed colours and fluxes .",
    "the probability of generating a certain luminosity at a certain redshift ( _ i.e. _ flux ) is introduced by the luminosity function and the evolutionary model adopted . as shown below , when sub - mm galaxies with detections at more than two wavelengths are considered , the results are quite insensitive to the differences in the evolutionary models adopted to generate the mock catalogue .",
    "the consideration of reasonable evolutionary models , however , allow plausible colour - based redshift solutions to be excluded .",
    "the available data - set for the sub - mm population of galaxies is usually restricted to a low - s / n detection at 850@xmath0 m and an upper - limit at 450@xmath0 m ( from scuba surveys ) , or a 1.2 mm detection ( from mambo surveys or an iram pdb follow - up observation ) , with , perhaps , radio observations at 1.4 , 5 or 8.6ghz .",
    "although a number of the scuba surveys have been conducted in fields previously observed by the infrared space observatory ( iso ) with the isophot camera at 170 and 90@xmath0 m , _",
    "e.g. _ hdf @xcite , elais n2 and the lockman hole @xcite , the iso measurements are generally too insensitive to provide any additional constraint on the photometric redshifts .",
    "the method described in section2 produces mock - catalogues that replicate the sensitivities and calibration accuracies of the original surveys in which each sub - mm galaxy was detected .",
    "the colours and fluxes of the mock galaxies provide diagnostic diagrams to illustrate the derivation of the most probable redshift : colour - colour - redshift ( @xmath50 ) diagrams , when more than 3-band detections are available ; colour - flux - redshift ( @xmath51 ) diagrams , when just two bands are available ; and flux - redshift ( @xmath52 ) diagrams ; when just one band detection is available . from these diagrams",
    "we derive the corresponding redshift probability distribution ( @xmath53 ) for each sub - mm galaxy .",
    "the distributions for a selection of sub - mm galaxies considered in this paper are shown in appendixa .",
    "lh850.1 is the brightest 850@xmath0 m source identified in the wide - area uk 8  mjy scuba survey of the lockman hole @xcite , and has one of the most complete fir  radio seds @xcite .",
    "bcr11 , named after source11 in the sub - mm catalogue of barger , cowie & richards ( 2000 ) , is a low s / n , but nonetheless representative , 850@xmath0 m source detected in a follow - up scuba photometry survey of the micro - jansky 1.4ghz radio sources in the hubble deep field @xcite .",
    "even though bcr11 was not first identified in a blank - field sub - mm survey , and hence is not included in the combined redshift distribution of the sub - mm selected galaxy population , it provides a useful source to discuss .",
    "the sub - mm photometry observations of bcr11 at the position of a known radio source @xcite guarantees that we have the correct association of a radio and sub - mm source , and hence the correct sed to analyse .",
    "bcr11 allows us to confidently derive the photometric redshift and accuracy that we can expect from only the 850@xmath0m/1.4ghz colour , which is commonly used to measure redshifts of blank - field sub - mm galaxies with follow - up radio observations ( cy99 , cy00 )",

    "have more extended wings , since they provide a significant population of sources at redshifts beyond 3 that can reproduce the colours of the observed galaxies .",
    "on the other hand , the combined luminosity and density evolution models ( led1 , led2 ) have a very strong decline in the density of sources at redshifts beyond 2 and 3.5 , and thus , the corresponding redshift distributions are much more concentrated to values between 2 and 3 .",
    "model led1 is the most extreme of these two evolutionary models , since the very strong negative luminosity and density evolution does not allow any source beyond redshift @xmath54 to be detected at any reasonable depth .",
    "the concentration effect is more dramatic on bcr11 , where the colour constraints are the weakest , and the wings of the redshift distribution are strongly dependent on the prior information on the galaxy population that has been used .",
    "the sharpness of this distribution is , thus , due to the prior , and not to the colour constraints .",
    "in contrast , the sharpness of the distribution of lh850.1 is intrinsic to the well determined colours of the source , and is almost independent of the prior .",
    "the comparison of lh850.1 and bcr11 demonstrates the improved redshift accuracy that , in general , one can expect for those sources with the greatest combination of deep multi - wavelength data . in the case of bcr11",
    ", it also illustrates the difficulty of constraining individual redshifts with observations at 1.4ghz and 850@xmath0 m only .",
    "the redshift probability distributions of both sources have very similar modes ( @xmath55 ) , yet for the less constraining evolutionary models ( le1 , le2 , le1l13 , le2l13 ) there remains 4050% and 2535% probabilities that bcr11 has a redshift @xmath56 and @xmath57 respectively .",
    "the corresponding probabilities for lh850.1 are 25 - 30% and 5% respectively . for models with a strong decline in the number of sources with redshift ( led1 , led2 ) , the high-@xmath1 tails are not produced .",
    "the sharpness of the derived redshift distributions is due to the lack of bright sources at high redshift , and not by the colours of the galaxy .",
    "[ fig : testref ] shows the manner in which the redshift distribution derived for lh850.1 ( using model le2 ) degrades as different observational constraints are successively taken into account .",
    "when the 450 , 850@xmath0 m , 1.2 mm and 1.4ghz detections are included in the analysis , the addition of upper limits to the sed makes no difference to the derived redshift distribution .",
    "it is also apparent that the distribution does not change significantly whilst the detection at 450@xmath0 m is used in the analysis , in combination with at least one additional band in the mm  sub - mm and radio regime .",
    "however , as soon as the 450@xmath0 m data is excluded , a high redshift tail appears .",
    "this is due to the large intrinsic scatter in the 1.4ghz/850@xmath0 m ratio amongst the template seds which , in the absence of the 450@xmath0 m data , allows galaxies over a wide range of redshifts to satisfy the colour constraints .",
    "the elimination of the radio data from the analysis allows more low - redshift sources to be possible counterparts of the detected source , and hence this flattens the resulting redshift distribution .",
    "the improvement in constraint on the photometric redshift is extremely important if it is to be used to determine the tuning of any broad - band mm ",
    "cm spectrograph , in an attempt to detect redshifted molecular co - lines .",
    "this is discussed further in section5 .",
    "higher frequency radio observations at @xmath58ghz and deep 450@xmath0 m observations , including sensitive upper - limits , are essential ground - based data that can provide the additional diagnostic power to constrain redshifts ( _ e.g. _ lh850.1 ) .      before we calculate the cumulative redshift - distribution for the 850@xmath0 m sources detected in the wide - area ( @xmath59  sq .",
    "arcmin ) blank - field scuba surveys , which include the lockman hole and elais n2 regions @xcite , and the cudss fields @xcite , it is instructive to discuss some of the typical redshift distributions that can be derived from data of different quality ( i.e. sensitivity and wavelength coverage ) for individual sources .",
    "therefore , we compare the redshift distributions of wide - area blank - field sub - mm sources with those detected in various lensing - cluster surveys @xcite .",
    "we also consider radio , fir and uv - selected objects with follow - up sub - mm data @xcite , and two bright sub - mm sources with extensive multi - wavelength observations , hdf850.1 @xcite , and the extremely - red object hr10 @xcite .",

    "appendixa contains the @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath53 diagrams and seds of the galaxies listed in tables 1 and 2 , and also a selection of those listed in table  3 for model le2 , which is one of the less constraining models considered and serves as an illustration of the points made here .    when we have the most complete multi - wavelength data - set ( rest - frame radio  sub - mm  fir , including upper limits ) then photometric redshifts can be constrained to a 68% confidence band of width @xmath60 ( table  1 and fig.a1 ) .",
    "those sub - mm galaxies for which just two detections , and perhaps some shallow upper - limits are available , do much worse , with accuracies at a 68% confidence level of width @xmath61 ( table  2 and figs .",
    "a merit of the monte carlo photometric - redshift method is that it can determine redshift probability distributions even in the case that the galaxies have just been detected in one band ( table  3 and fig .",
    "a3 ) , the result being very flat redshift distributions , that are highly dependent on the assumed evolutionary model .",
    "this is especially important because half of the sub - mm sources in the blank - field surveys belong to this category , although it is worth noting that several of these previously reported sub - mm sources have now been found to be spurious ( ivison et al . 2002 ) .    often , the well constrained distributions are asymmetric , skewed towards lower redshifts with a high - redshift tail ( _ e.g. _ lh850.1 , n2850.2 , hr10 , ... in figs .  2 and a1 )",
    "this is a natural consequence of the ability of the data ( particularly with a deep 450@xmath0 m detection or upper limit , @xmath62mjy ) to strongly reject the possibility of sub - mm galaxies lying at @xmath63 , whilst the same observational data can not reject the possibility that the sub - mm galaxies lie at a much higher redshift , @xmath64 .",
    "examples of the power with which the 450@xmath0 m detections or upper - limits can reject @xmath65 can be seen in the seds of lh850.1 and hdf850.1 ( figs .  3 and a1 ) , respectively . on the other hand ,",
    "the bright isophot detections at 170@xmath0 m ( @xmath66mjy ) make a strong case that the sources lie at @xmath67 , for example n140 , n164 ( fig .",
    "a1 ) and n18 ( fig .",
    "a2 ) , whilst the isophot non - detections are too shallow to offer any additional constraints on the seds of the majority of the sub - mm population ( e.g. lh850.1 , hdf850.1 in figs .  3 and a1 ) .",
    "it is also possible to obtain a bimodal redshift probability distribution for some galaxies ( e.g. smmj00266 + 1708 in fig .",
    "a1 , bcr33 in fig .",
    "a2 ) , an effect created by two or more template seds reproducing the same observed colours at very different redshifts .",
    "the figures in appendixa show the insensitivity of the 850@xmath0m/1.4ghz ratio to redshift when the sources are at @xmath68 ( a point also made by cy99 , cy00 ) .",
    "the redshift distributions in these cases are usually shallow , with long high - redshift tails ( e.g. bcr11 , bcr13 , mmj154127 + 6615 , in fig .",
    "a2 ) , although exceptions also occur ( smmj16403 + 4644 in fig .",
    "the distributions are even broader in the cases when only a sub - mm detection and a radio upper - limit are available ( fig .",
    "all these redshift distributions are narrower for those evolutionary models with a strong decline beyond @xmath69 , as can be seen from the measurements in tables  2 and 3 , especially for lde1 which essentially contains no sources at high-@xmath1 .    a quick browse through appendix",
    "a illustrates the variety of template seds that reproduce the colours of an individual sub - mm galaxy , which lends support to the use of a template library in the derivation of the photometric redshifts .",
    "a few sub - mm sources , however , still can not be reproduced at any redshift with the template seds available ( e.g. lh850.12 , smmj16403 + 46437 ) .",
    "a possible explanation for this problem is the contribution of agn emission to the radio - fluxes at a level not included in the seds of the template library , or a mis - identification of a sub - mm galaxy with a nearby radio - source ( see also section4 ) .",
    "a wider range of seds , including modest fractions of galaxies with an excess of radio - emission , could partially solve this problem but , on the other hand , it would also introduce an extra error term in the redshift computation for the rest of the sub - mm galaxies .",
    "other sub - mm galaxies have only a small representation of analogs among the mock galaxies ( e.g. n1 - 40 , smmj14009 + 0252 ) , most probably because they are rare objects in the universe , either by their intrinsically high luminosity or their low redshift .",
    "this latter point is illustrated by the rarity of mock galaxies in the corresponding @xmath50 or @xmath51 diagrams , assuming any of the evolutionary scenarios considered in this paper .",
    "8 shows the comparison of photometric and published spectroscopic redshifts for 8 galaxies : in order of increasing redshift , n140 , cudss14.18 , n164 , smmj023990134 , hr10 , smmj14011 + 0252 , smmj02399@xmath380136 , and w@xmath38mm11 .",

    "a2 ) , and the latter on a 850@xmath0 m detection with a @xmath71 m upper limit ( fig .",
    "these two objects illustrate the large confidence intervals that have to be considered when the redshifts are derived from a single colour .",
    "specifically , smmj02399@xmath380134 illustrates the uncertainties attached to the large dispersion of 1.4ghz/850@xmath0 m colours implied from a local sample of galaxies . the agreement between spectroscopic and photometric redshifts for the remaining six galaxies ( with more than one colour available )",
    "is remarkably good .",
    "the asymmetry of the error bars is a reflection of the skewness of their respective @xmath53 distributions ( figs .",
    "a1 , a2 ) .",
    "these sources illustrate the importance of obtaining the description of the whole redshift distribution instead of relying on measurements of the median , which departs significantly from the most probable redshift in skewed distributions .",
    "a larger sample of spectroscopic redshifts is obviously essential to assess the statistical significance of the goodness of this technique , and the accuracy of the error bars we derive . for the sources with more than one measured colour , these errors are mainly the result of the scatter in the shapes of the template seds",
    ". a larger sample of spectroscopic redshifts would allow us to fine - tune the selection of seds and priors in order to trim the error bars if , for instance , the modes of the distributions do not populate the envelope of error bars implied from the analysis .",
    "the six best constrained redshift distributions ( shown in black in fig .",
    "7 ) do show a tendency to cluster more around the @xmath72 line than the collective extension of their error bars .",

    "deep interferometric radio observations , however , remain a practical way to pinpoint the source of the sub - mm emission with sufficient positional accuracy to investigate galaxy morphologies and exploit optical / ir spectroscopic line diagnostics .",
    "this limitation of the radio  sub - mm technique prompted the design and construction of a balloon - borne large aperture submillimetre telescope , blast @xcite .",
    "the primary scientific goal of blast is to break the current `` redshift deadlock '' by providing photometric redshifts with sufficient accuracy , without the prior necessity for secure optical , ir or radio counterparts .",

    "this ir detection now gives greater confidence to the likelihood that the coincident radio emission , with a flux density of 16@xmath144jy at 1.4ghz , from the combined data of merlin and the vla , is genuinely associated with the sub - mmm source @xcite .",
    "furthermore this strengthens the suggestion that a marginal 3.3@xmath84 detection at 8.4ghz ( vla 3651 + 1226 , richards , priv .",

    "the redshift probability distribution for hdf850.1 , based on the multi - wavelength 170@xmath0m1.4ghz data , indicates @xmath1 is comprised between 3.3 and 5.4 with a 86% to 90% confidence depending on the adopted prior ( fig.[fig : hdf_co ] ) .",
    "this high photometric redshift supports the earlier decision to reject the @xmath145 elliptical galaxy 3@xmath38586 , as the optical counterpart .",
    "unfortunately the ir counterpart , hdf850.1k , is too faint to attempt ir spectroscopy with even the 10-m class of telescopes .",

    "it is possible to eliminate the necessity for an optical / ir counterpart , or a position accurate to @xmath146arcsec . given the predicted accuracy of the photometric redshift for hdf850.1 , and taking all of the uncertainties discussed in section  2 into account , we demonstrate in fig.[fig : hdf_co ] that the j=10 co line in hdf850.1 has a 86 - 90% probability of detection in the k - band receiver ( 18.026.5 ghz ) on the gbt .",

    "<S> ground - based sub - mm and mm - wavelength blank - field surveys have identified more than 100 sources , the majority of which are believed to be dusty optically - obscured starburst galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> colours derived from various combinations of fir , submillimetre , millimetre , and radio fluxes provide the only currently available means to determine the redshift distribution of this new galaxy population .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we apply our monte - carlo photometric - redshift technique , introduced in paperi ( hughes et al . 2002 ) , to the multi - wavelength data available for 77 galaxies selected at 850@xmath0 m and 1.25 mm . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate a probability distribution for the redshift of each galaxy , which includes a detailed treatment of the observational errors and uncertainties in the evolutionary model . </S>",
    "<S> the cumulative redshift distribution of the submillimetre galaxy population that we present in this paper , based on 50 galaxies found in wide - area scuba surveys , is asymmetric , and broader than those published elsewhere , with a significant high-@xmath1 tail for some of the evolutionary models considered . </S>",
    "<S> approximately 40 to 90 per cent of the sub - mm population is expected to have redshifts in the interval @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> whilst this result is completely consistent with earlier estimates for the sub - mm galaxy population , we also show that the colours of many ( @xmath3 per cent ) individual sub - mm sources , detected only at 850@xmath0 m with non - detections at other wavelengths , are consistent with those of starburst galaxies that lie at extreme redshifts , @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> spectroscopic confirmation of the redshifts , through the detection of rest - frame fir  mm wavelength molecular transition - lines , will ultimately calibrate the accuracy of this technique . </S>",
    "<S> we use the redshift probability distribution of hdf850.1 to illustrate the ability of the method to guide the choice of possible frequency tunings on the broad - band spectroscopic receivers that equip the large aperture single - dish mm and cm - wavelength telescopes .    </S>",
