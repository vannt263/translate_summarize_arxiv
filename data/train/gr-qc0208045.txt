    "it is well known that quantum fields can produce local renormalized negative energy densities .",
    "this is despite the fact that the classical expression for the energy density appears to be positive definite .",
    "the negative energy density is possible because renormalization involves an infinite subtraction , and is needed to make the stress tensor operator well - defined .",
    "if there were no restrictions on the sorts of negative energy densities attainable , one could have a number of bizarre possibilities , including traversable wormholes @xcite , faster - than - light travel @xcite time travel @xcite , and violations of the second law of thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "such phenomena are , at best , rare .",
    "fortunately , there are known to be severe constraints on the magnitude and duration of negative energy fluxes or densities , at least in the case of linear fields .",
    "these are the quantum inequalities , which take the typical form @xcite @xmath0 here @xmath1 is the renormalized energy density in an arbitrary quantum state , @xmath2 is a normalized sampling function with a characteristic width @xmath3 , @xmath4 is a dimensionless constant , usually somewhat less than unity , and @xmath5 is the dimension of spacetime .",
    "most of the work on quantum inequalities is for the cases of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "more precisely , eq .  ( [ eq : qi ] ) is a worldline quantum inequality for an inertial observer in minkowski spacetime , where @xmath8 is the observer s proper time .",
    "( recently , worldline inequalities have been established in much greater generality in globally hyperbolic spacetimes @xcite . )",
    "the physical interpretation of this constraint is that there is an inverse relation between the magnitude of the negative energy and its duration .",
    "for example , in four dimensions , the observer will not see the negative energy last for a time longer than about @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the maximally negative energy density seen by this observer .",
    "this type of constraint greatly limits the macroscopic effects of negative energy .",
    "in particular , macroscopic wormholes or `` warp drive '' spacetimes are severely constrained @xcite .",
    "furthermore , one can use the worldline inequalities to place some constraints on the spatial distribution of negative energy @xcite .",
    "all allowed spatial distributions must be such that eq .",
    "( [ eq : qi ] ) is satisfied for _ every _ inertial observer in minkowski spacetime .",
    "there is a different type of constraint on the energy density , which is that the total energy in any quantum state for a quantum field in boundary - free minkowski spacetime must be non - negative .",
    "let the hamiltonian operator be @xmath11 where the integral is taken over all space at a fixed time .",
    "the expectation value of @xmath12 in an arbitrary quantum state is non - negative : @xmath13 and @xmath14 only in the vacuum state .",
    "thus any non - vacuum state must have net positive energy , even though there can be local regions with negative energy density .",
    "this raises the question of whether there are spatial or spacetime quantum inequalities analogous to eq .",
    "( [ eq : qi ] ) , but involving sampling over space or space and time . for spacetime averages",
    ", there is an abstract existence proof for a very general class of such inequalities in globally hyperbolic spacetimes .",
    "these include , for example , inequalities bounding violations of the dominant energy condition @xcite . however , at present quantitative estimates for these are not known .",
    "one can get some spacetime quantum inequalities by simply averaging the worldline inequalities over families of worldlines with spatial weighting factors , but in at least some cases these are known not to be sharp . for example , stronger constraints were found in two - dimensional minkowksi space @xcite .",
    "we may express these as @xmath15 here @xmath16 is a spatial sampling function with width @xmath17 , @xmath18 is a temporal sampling function with width @xmath3 , and the bound @xmath19 is finite as long as at least one of @xmath17 and @xmath3 is nonzero .",
    "the sampling functions are assumed to be each normalized to unity : @xmath20 if the sampling functions are both lorentzian functions , then @xmath21 ; if they are both gaussians , then @xmath22 . in either case ,",
    "one obtains the corresponding worldline inequality when @xmath23 , and a nontrivial bound on the spatially sampled energy density when @xmath24 .",
    "one consequence of this is that in two dimensions the spacetime averaged results are stronger than the temporally averaged ones , since as @xmath25 ( for @xmath26 ) one gets a finite bound .",
    "it is natural to ask if there is a generalization of eq .",
    "( [ eq : stqi ] ) to four - dimensional spacetime , especially one which gives a nontrivial bound when the sampling is over space only .",
    "one of us @xcite has given an argument that this is not the case , and that the spatially sampled energy density can be unbounded below .",
    "actually , the argument was written out there for a more generic situation , that of evolution from a cauchy surface in a general curved spacetime .",
    "while explicit constructions were given in this case , they were by pseudodifferential operator techniques , and they were not translated into more conventional quantum field - theoretic terms .",
    "also , the details of the more special case of a surface of constant time in minkowski space were not written out .",
    "so no explicit version of the argument in conventional special - relativistic quantum field - theoretic terms has yet been given .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to provide such an example and to draw as many physical insights as possible from it . in the following section",
    ", we will provide the explicit construction of a class of quantum states for the massless , minimally coupled scalar field , with negative energy density , as well as give the two - point function and the energy density in this class of states .",

    ", we will discuss some of the insights which may be drawn from this example .",
    "we are now in a position to draw a number of conclusions from our example .",
    "the first conclusion is the proof that there are no lower bounds on the spatially sampled energy density for the massless minimally coupled scalar field in four spacetime dimensions . to be more precise ,",
    "consider the spatial average of the energy density @xmath130 at time @xmath8 , where @xmath131 is a spatial sampling function .",
    "let @xmath132 be the characteristic width of this function .",
    "more generally , @xmath132 can be the maximum width of @xmath131 in any direction .",
    "if there were to be spatial quantum inequalities here , @xmath133 would have to have a lower bound when we vary over all quantum states for a given @xmath131 .",
    "however , the energy density in the above example varies in space only over a scale of the order of @xmath134 which can be arbitrary .",
    "furthermore , we can make the energy density in a region whose size is less than @xmath135 arbitrarily negative . for a given sampling function @xmath131",
    ", we can choose @xmath136 , so that the energy density is approximately constant over the region being sampled and the spatial sampling has no effect , yet the energy density in that region is arbitrarily negative . thus @xmath133 is unbounded below . however , this state satisfies the temporal quantum inequality , eq .",
    "( [ eq : qi ] ) .",
    "one can argue from energy conservation that physically what is happening is that there must be large fluxes of positive energy entering the region , which damp out the negative energy sufficiently for the temporal inequality to hold .",
    "recall from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : rho2_0 ] ) and  ( [ eq : rho_1_2 ] ) that @xmath80 oscillates much more rapidly in time than does @xmath79 . thus if @xmath137 at one time , it has changed sign a short time later .",
    "this causes the time integral of @xmath80 to tend to average to zero , and allows the worldline quantum inequalities to be satisfied .",
    "we can gain more physical insight into the behavior of this class of states by recalling that in the high frequency limit , the pairs of particles in the two - particle component of the state have nearly but not exactly opposite momenta , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : oppks ] .",
    "this allows the scale for the spatial variation of @xmath138 to be large compared to the temporal scale , which is set by the characteristic frequency of the excited modes .",
    "this can be seen in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rho2a ] ) , where the spatial factor @xmath139 oscillates much more slowly than the temporal factor @xmath140 .",
    "one can summarize the difference between the spatial and temporal behaviors by noting that it is possible for the three - momenta of a pair of particles to cancel , but not their energies .",
    "we can also see that it is a very special property of two - dimensional spacetime which allows for the existence of spatial bounds . here",
    "the momenta of a pair of particles must be either exactly parallel or exactly anti - parallel .",
    "however , if they are anti - parallel , there is a factor analogous to the factor of @xmath141 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rho ] ) which suppresses their contribution .",
    "although in this paper we have looked only at four - dimensional spacetime , it seems likely that one can construct similar counterexamples to spatial quantum inequalities in all spacetime dimensions greater than two .",
    "we can also understand why the hamiltonian , obtained by integrating over all space , is bounded below , yet the spatial average over any sampling function with finite width is not . the integration over all space removes the contribution of the @xmath80 term , leaving only the non - negative contribution of the @xmath79 term .",
    "thus the net energy in any state must be non - negative .",
    "however , it is possible for the spatial distribution at a fixed time to be such that the compensating positive energy is arbitrarily far from the negative energy , and hence violates a spatial quantum inequality .",
    "the current results also shed light on an earlier proposed explanation of the `` garfinkle box '' , given in ref .",
    "@xcite . this refers to an unpublished result of garfinkle @xcite , who showed that the total energy of a scalar field , @xmath142 , contained within an imaginary box in minkowski spacetime , at fixed time , is unbounded below .",
    "the box is `` imaginary '' in the sense that there are no physical boundaries at the walls of the box .",
    "the garfinkle result is that there exist quantum states for which @xmath142 is arbitrarily negative .",
    "the proposed explanation given in ref .",
    "@xcite for the unboundedness of the total energy @xmath142 in this box involved two factors : ( 1 ) the energy is measured at a precise instant in time , and ( 2 ) the walls of the box are sharply defined .",
    "it was argued that this allows an arbitrary amount of negative energy to have entered the box by time @xmath8 , while at this time excluding an even larger amount of positive energy which may be just outside of the box at time @xmath8 .",
    "the results of the present paper show that , although this is _ an _ explanation of the garfinkle result , it is not the only explanation .",
    "in particular , the unboundedness of the energy in our case does not require the spatial region over which we average to be sharply defined .    in this connection",
    ", we emphasize that our results show that the unboundedly negative energies can not be ascribed to `` edge effects '' associated with the sampling function .",
    "this is because in our examples , the energy density is uniformly negative throughout the sampling region .    while spatially averaged quantum inequalities do not exist , we noted earlier that spacetime averaged ones do .",
    "this means that the lower bounds associated with the spacetime averages must diverge as the temporal averaging scale goes to zero .",
    "it is natural to conjecture that this is related to the divergence in the spatially averaged inequalities , as follows .",
    "suppose the most severe divergence attainable in the spatial average is @xmath143 for some function @xmath144 of the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath44 .",
    "similarly , suppose that for a temporal averaging function @xmath18 with characteristic width @xmath3 , we have @xmath145 for some function @xmath146 .",
    "it is natural to ask if @xmath147 .",
    "a relation like this would probably give the most direct physical significance to the divergences in the spatial averages .",
    "( such a relation would not hold in two dimensions , but might in four . )",
    "the logarithmic divergences ( of the energy density with the cutoff @xmath44 ) are rather slow",
    ". we do not know whether it is possible to construct examples in minkowski space with more severe divergences .",
    "( in ref .",
    "@xcite , more severe divergences were found at cauchy surfaces with non - zero second fundamental forms . in generic curved spacetimes",
    ", this would be the case for all cauchy surfaces . )    in summary , we have shown that there are no purely spatially averaged quantum inequalities over bounded regions in four - dimensional minkowski spacetime , even though the integral over all space is bounded .",
    "however , spacetime averaged quantum inequalities do exist .",
    "as noted earlier , in at least the two - dimensional case , spacetime averaging seems to lead to tighter bounds than does temporal averaging alone .",
    "recent numerical results of dawson and fewster @xcite indicate that similar behavior occurs in four dimensions .",
    "however , at present the extent to which spacetime averaging improves temporal averaging is unclear .",
    "thus there appear to be two approaches for better understanding the allowed spatial distributions of negative energy .",
