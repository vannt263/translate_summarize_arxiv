    "the location of the interface between two immiscible liquids or between a liquid and a gas is essential in microfluidic applications since the meniscus determines the way light is scattered @xcite , how chemical species interact @xcite , the way drops are transported in small channels @xcite , and so forth .",
    "attention must be given to liquid channels or capillaries where the cross - section is nonuniform , since liquid channels are never perfectly uniform and , as we show below , this nonuniformity has a strong effect on the meniscus location @xcite .    consider a liquid contained in a channel with hard walls and a varying cross section , and suppose that there is a pressure difference @xmath0 between the two sides of the meniscus . at first glance",
    ", it seems that an increase in @xmath0 will cause the meniscus to move to the point where the laplace pressure , as determined from the local geometry , equals @xmath0 , so the meniscus location as a function of @xmath0 is continuous if the channel is smooth .",
    "when a dielectrophoretic force or , indeed , a gravitational force , is acting on the liquid at the same time , we find that this naive picture is changed and that the meniscus location becomes a discontinuous function of @xmath0 .",
    "the current case is different from those of refs @xcite in that ( i ) it takes into account gravity and electrostatic forces , ( ii ) pressure differences exist even for a flat interface due to an external `` pumping '' , and ( iii ) the liquid layer is found underneath the solid surface and acts as a big reservoir .",
    "to be concrete , we consider the illustration in figure 1 .",
    "a similar wedge - shaped geometry has recently been investigated on homogeneous ( miscible ) mixtures @xcite . here , the meniscus can be a liquid  gas or liquid  liquid interface , and its location is given by @xmath1 ( being negative in part a and positive in part b ) .",
    "the distance between the tilted planes at @xmath2 is @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is the tilt angle . in regular capillary rise",
    ", @xmath1 is positive if the wetting angle @xmath5 is smaller than @xmath6 and is negative if @xmath7 .",
    "in addition to the gravitational forces and the pressure difference , a dielectrophoretic force is acting : a high - frequency voltage difference @xmath8 is imposed across the two tilted planes .",
    "the frequency is assumed to be high enough so ionic screening does not occur , and the force exerted on the liquid is dielectrophoretic in nature .",
    "we restrict ourselves to narrow capillaries , where @xmath9 is satisfied , where @xmath10 is the capillary length ( @xmath11 is the interfacial tension , and @xmath12 is the density difference between the two liquids ) . in this case , as will be verified below , the height is larger than the radius , @xmath13 , and the height variations of the meniscus surface are negligible compared to the total height . in mechanical equilibrium , at the contact line , the laplace pressure is balanced by the hydrostatic pressure @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the pressure difference and @xmath16 is the inverse curvature given by @xmath17 . here , @xmath18 is the surface separation at the meniscus location and is given by @xmath19 .",
    "the height - dependent electric field is @xcite @xmath20 finally , @xmath21 is the permittivity difference between the liquid and the gas or between the two liquids .",
    "the electric field has two general effects : ( i ) it exerts a net dielectrophoretic body force on the liquid and ( ii ) it changes the contact angle .",
    "the exact influence of the electric field thus depends on the applied frequency @xcite .",
    "unless otherwise stated , we will deal with the high - frequency regime , where the electric field is dielectrophoretic in nature , and the contact angle is unaffected by the field .",
    "equation [ gov_eqn0 ] is the basic relation for the meniscus location , and it will be studied in detail for several cases below .",
    "the gravitational force is zero if the channel is horizontal , as occurs in many cases , or if @xmath12 is sufficiently small . in this case , we are faced with the following equation : @xmath22 note that if @xmath23 is zero , there is a balance of the dielectrophoretic force against the surface tension , and this leads to some liquid height @xmath1 where the forces balance .",
    "@xmath1 in this case is a continuous function of the system parameters ( e.g. , @xmath8 ) . since this is the less interesting scenario , we now assume , without loss of generality , that @xmath24 .",
    "we obtain the following for the mechanical balance :        @xmath25    this relation can be further cast in the dimensionless form : @xmath26 where @xmath27 and the dimensionless numbers are @xmath28 let us look at the magnitude of @xmath29 and @xmath30 . for a pressure difference @xmath31 atm , surface tension @xmath32 n / m , and @xmath33 mm , we find @xmath34 .",
    "if @xmath35 ( where @xmath36 is the vacuum permittivity ) and @xmath37v , we find @xmath38 .",
    "thus , @xmath29 can be very large while @xmath30 is typically quite small , and the product is @xmath39 .",
    "equation [ parabola_x ] is a parabola in the variable @xmath40 , and @xmath40 is always positive , because @xmath41 .",
    "let us look at the case of positive @xmath29 and @xmath30 but negative @xmath42 ; this means that the dielectric liquid is pulled toward higher values of @xmath1 by the electric field and applied pressure .",
    "the minimum of the parabola is at @xmath43 .",
    "if @xmath30 or @xmath29 is sufficiently small , there are two roots to the equation : an unstable one @xmath44 and a stable root @xmath45 ( see figure 2a ) .",
    "figure 2b shows @xmath1 as a function of the product @xmath46 at given @xmath4 and @xmath5 values .",
    "there is no solution if @xmath29 or @xmath30 is too large , and this occurs when @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is a critical value of @xmath46 .",
    "hence , an increase of @xmath46 from below to above @xmath49 leads to a jump of the meniscus from @xmath50 given by @xmath51 to the top of the capillary .",
    "relation [ ab_crit ] can be inverted to give a condition for a critical angle @xmath52 : @xmath53 the meniscus location is changing continuously for @xmath54 and is found at the capillary s top when @xmath55 .",
    "the phase diagram is presented in figure 3 as a function of @xmath4 and @xmath5 for different values of @xmath46 . as the value of @xmath46 increases from zero , the area below the @xmath56 lines ( solid curves ) increases .",
    "this area is where the meniscus is found at the top of the liquid channel , while above it the meniscus location is continuous .",
    "lines ( a ) and ( b ) are for @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively . curve ( c ) corresponds to @xmath59 , and it is the first that touches the limiting diagonal line @xmath60 .",
    "as @xmath46 increases above @xmath61 , the line @xmath56 overlaps with the @xmath60 line for small values of @xmath5 but not for large ones ( curve ( d ) for @xmath62 ) .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath63 occurs at @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , from eq [ ab_crit ] , we see that there is another special value of @xmath46 : @xmath65 hence , when @xmath66 the meniscus is at the top for all values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .    in the following section , we investigate the case of a tapered liquid channel under a gravitational force in addition to the dielectrophoretic force but in the absence of pressure difference .",
    "we now turn to the rather complex case where there are dielectrophoretic and interfacial tension forces acting , together with gravity , but no pressure difference .",
    "the governing equation reads as follows : @xmath67 the high - frequency limit of the potential @xmath8 corresponds to the purely dielectrophoretic case , where @xmath5 is simply the zero - field contact angle . in the low - frequency limit , @xmath68 , the dielectrophoretic force vanishes ( this is equivalent to setting @xmath69 above ) , while @xmath70 is the voltage - dependent ( lipmann ) contact angle .",
    "the gravitational force introduces the capillary length @xmath10 , and this length is used to scale all lengths in the system .",
    "the above equation can be expressed using dimensionless lengths as follows : @xmath71 where @xmath72 to investigate the field effect , we note that @xmath30 is usually small and seek solutions with @xmath73 . in the absence of an electric field ( @xmath74 ) , eq [ gov_eqn3b ] was recently studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , and we give here a brief summary of the main results .",
    "we rewrite eq [ gov_eqn3b ] without the @xmath30-dependent terms as follows : @xmath75 @xmath76 has a maximum at @xmath77 , and its value at the maximum is @xmath78 .",
    "thus , for hydrophilic surfaces ( @xmath79 ) , for small and negative @xmath4 values , there is a solution to eq [ gov_eqn3c ] .",
    "if @xmath80 is too large , however , there is no solution : @xmath81 is smaller than @xmath82 , and the meniscus jumps from @xmath83 to the capillary s end ( to the top if @xmath84 and to the bottom if @xmath85 ) .",
    "the condition for the meniscus jump is as follows :        @xmath86    alternatively , the condition can be expressed as a condition for a critical angle @xmath56 : @xmath87 for a negative angle @xmath4 , the meniscus location is continuous if @xmath54 , while the meniscus is at the top for every @xmath55 .",
    "the system is invariant with respect to the transformation @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "hence , for a positive value of @xmath4 , if @xmath54 , the meniscus is at the capillary s bottom , and its location is continuously changing for @xmath55 .",
    "there is a `` special '' angle @xmath90 given by @xmath91 . if @xmath92 , the meniscus location as a function of @xmath5 is continuous for all @xmath5 values .",
    "we now add the field s effect and treat eq [ gov_eqn3b ] perturbatively with small @xmath30 values .",
    "we are looking for the maximum of @xmath76 from eq [ gov_eqn3b ] . using @xmath73",
    ", we find that @xmath93 to first order in @xmath30 , the relation replacing eq [ cond_zero_field ] is @xmath94 note that , in the preceding derivation , the second term on the right - hand side was assumed to be small compared with the first term . however , as @xmath4 approaches @xmath6 , the first term goes to zero , while @xmath95 is finite : in this limit , the dielectrophoretic term dominates and does not represent a small correction anymore , and our derivation fails .",
    "the condition for the critical angle becomes @xmath96 figure 4 summarizes these findings .",
    "the zero - field critical value of @xmath97 is shown as dashed lines in figure 4a , while the solid lines represent the critical angle for the case where @xmath98 . at a positive @xmath4 value , if @xmath55 , the meniscus location is continuously changing with @xmath5 . below the diagonal dashed line @xmath1 ,",
    "is positive , while @xmath99 above the dashed line . above the @xmath52 , line the meniscus is at the capillary s bottom .",
    "note that the electric field breaks the symmetry of the system : while basically similar behavior appears at negative values of @xmath4 , the operation @xmath100 and @xmath89 does not leave the system invariant as it does for the @xmath74 case .",
    "we now consider the case of a liquid dielectric rise in tapered capacitors .",
    "we assume that the interfacial tension @xmath11 is negligibly small and that there are no imposed pressure differences : @xmath101 .",
    "the first treatment to this problem was given by t. b. jones in a classical paper from 1974 @xcite .",
    "the hydrostatic pressure is balanced by the dielectrophoretic force , yielding @xmath102 or , expressed differently , @xmath103 where the dimensionless quantities are @xmath104 and @xmath105 is given by @xmath106 the difference between our derivation and the one by jones is the expression for the electric field ( eq [ efield ] ) , which is more accurate for large angles ( @xmath4 ) ; however , in the limit @xmath107 , we expect to recover jones results . in the more usual case of a nontapered capillary ( @xmath108 )",
    ", we recover the familiar expression @xmath109 which is equivalent to @xmath110 in physical quantities .",
    "let us concentrate on the case where @xmath84 .",
    "as is seen in figure 5 , @xmath111 has an inflection point .",
    "there are two extrema located at @xmath112 both extrema are positive and smaller than the maximum height in the capillary , @xmath113 .",
    "the value of @xmath111 at these extrema is @xmath114 the left - hand side of eq [ gov_eqn1 ] represents a horizontal line , and it can cross @xmath111 at the right or left branch . on increasing @xmath4 from zero ,",
    "the solution jumps from the right branch to the left one when @xmath115 , that is , when @xmath116 alternatively , for the critical voltage @xmath117 , we find the following expression : @xmath118 figure 6a shows the phase diagram for the meniscus location .",
    "the solid line is @xmath119 from eq [ gov_diag1 ] . at a given negative value of @xmath4 ,",
    "if @xmath119 is below the critical line , the meniscus is at the top of the capillary , while above this line the meniscus location is continuous .",
    "figure 6b expresses this behavior in the @xmath4 ",
    "@xmath8 plane .",
    "as @xmath8 is increased above @xmath117 given by eq [ vc ] , the meniscus jumps to the capillary s top .",
    "the meniscus location is continuous below it .    in the following section",
    ", we find that similarities appear for a liquid channel blocked at one end , because in this case the pressure difference @xmath0 depends on the meniscus location .",
    "in this section , we turn to describing the meniscus location in tapered channels where one of the ends is blocked .",
    "the interface is a gas  liquid interface , as depicted in figure 7 . in the following ,",
    "we assume that gravity and electric fields are absent , but nonetheless we find that the meniscus location can be discontinuous .",
    "the reason for this is the nonlinear dependence of the gas pressure in the area enclosed by the liquid and the walls on the gas volume , and the gas pressure must be balanced by the laplace pressure .",
    "the liquid channel is wedge - shaped , with large and small opening radii @xmath120 and @xmath121 , as measured from the imaginary meeting point of the channel walls , and the opening angle is @xmath122 , as defined in figure 7 .",
    "let us call @xmath123 and @xmath124 the gas volume and pressure , respectively , just before contact of the liquid channel with the liquid reservoir ; @xmath124 is also the ambient pressure in the liquid .",
    "the channel is then brought in contact with the liquid , the liquid pressure is increased by an amount @xmath0 , and the liquid may penetrate to a distance @xmath125 inside the capillary .",
    "it follows from simple geometry that the maximum gas volume @xmath123 ( i.e. , when @xmath126 ) is @xmath127 where @xmath128 is its depth in the third dimension ( in the page ) .",
    "the total gas volume for @xmath129 is @xmath130        assuming the ideal gas law @xmath131 , we find that the gas pressure is @xmath132 the outside pressure is increased to @xmath133 .",
    "we continue in the limit of the very small channel opening , that is , @xmath134 and @xmath135 , and therefore , eq [ gov_eqn2 ] with @xmath136 leads to @xmath137 this governing equation can be written using the dimensionless variables @xmath138 in the following form : @xmath139 at this point , we would like to remind the reader that if the ambient pressure is atmospheric , @xmath140 pa , it follows that @xmath141 , where we took @xmath32 n / m and @xmath142 cm . in the following ,",
    "we will concentrate on @xmath143 ; however , we will assume @xmath144 .",
    "we would like to stress that one can also ask the following question : at what value of interfacial tension @xmath11 does the meniscus jump for a given value of @xmath146 ?",
    "the expression for @xmath167 as a function of @xmath146 is obtained directly from the inversion of eq [ eps_c ] .",
    "in addition , we recall that the ideal gas pressure @xmath124 is given by @xmath168 , where @xmath169 is the gas density , @xmath170 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath171 is the absolute temperature .",
    "we thus point out that one can hold both @xmath0 and @xmath11 constant while changing the temperature . again , eq [ eps_c ] can be used to find a critical temperature @xmath172 for the meniscus jump .",
    "in this article , we consider in detail the location of a liquid  liquid or liquid  gas interface in tapered capillaries .",
    "the driving forces are external pressure difference , interfacial tension , and electrostatic and gravitational forces .",
    "as one would naively expect , a small change in the external forces usually leads to a small change in the equilibrium interface location .",
    "however , as is shown above without exception , due to the nonlinearity of the competing forces , there are critical values of the external parameters : pressure , wetting angle , voltage , and so forth .",
    "if the external force is close to its critical value , the equilibrium interface location is discontinuous .",
    "this is a rather general phenomenon in capillaries with nonuniform cross - sections , and occurs even at small `` opening angles '' @xmath4 . in section 2",
    ", we considered a capillary with a pressure difference and dielectrophoretic forces and obtained the threshold values of applied voltage or pressure difference to drive the meniscus location discontinuity . in section 3 , we studied the liquid rise in capillaries under a weak dielectrophoretic force and gravity .",
    "the meniscus jump was discussed in terms of the wetting angle @xmath5 and wedge opening angle @xmath4 .",
    "we further looked in section 4 at the classical problem of dielectric rise , but this time in a tapered capacitor .",
    "again , we found that the meniscus location exhibits discontinuities as a function of applied voltage or the geometrical parameters .",
    "finally , in section 5 , we considered liquid penetration into closed volumes and once more found a similar transition for the meniscus location as a function of the external driving forces .",
    "the rich behavior found above is certainly relevant to several microfluidic systems , where the control of the liquid  gas or liquid  liquid interface at the small scale is important .",
    "a generalization which fully takes into account the frequency dependence of electric fields is a natural extension of the current work and should be explored @xcite , especially in the context of microfluidic systems .",
