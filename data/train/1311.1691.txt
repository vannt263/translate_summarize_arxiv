    "dusty toruses play a significant role in the active galactic nuclei ( agn ) unification scheme @xcite causing the main differences between various types of seyfert galaxies . in obscured agns ( sy2 ) the nuclear emission",
    "is partially absorbed by a torus ( depending on energy and column density , @xmath6 , values ) .",
    "that is why the x - ray spectra of these objects are usually considered to contain two components : the emission reprocessed ( scattered ) by the dusty torus and the direct ( unscattered ) emission , which dominates at energies @xmath7kev and @xmath8kev , respectively .",
    "thus the broad - band x - ray observations are often used to determine the agn geometry and physical conditions of matter around a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) .",
    "recent increasing of physical models based on monte carlo simulations provided us with a powerful tools for studying various properties of torus , such as geometry , column density , inclination and opening angles .",
    "the ngc3281 galaxy is very interesting object in this regard , because it is a candidate for compton - thick source .",
    "it is is a near - by , low - redshifted ( @xmath9 ) x - ray bright radio quiet , sab spiral galaxy with type 2 active galactic nucleus ( sy2 ) .",
    "asca observations of this object revealed relatively hight value of hydrogen column density @xmath10@xmath2 @xcite , taking into account that in the mid - infrared ( mid - ir ) amplitude @xmath11 .",
    "thus , following @xcite , @xmath12 is a value of the order of magnitude significantly larger than the one determined along the line of sight in the milky way @xcite .",
    "that fact can be considered as a proof of the presence of the optically - thick absorber of both x - ray and ir emission here , possibly with partial covering .",
    "vignali & comastri @xcite studied ngc3281 galaxy in x - ray , treating the bepposax data , and had shown that ngc3281 is a compton - thick source with @xmath13@xmath2 .",
    "their @xmath12 value is two times higher than that obtained by simpson from asca observations .",
    "they also showed the presence of reflection dominated continuum at 310kev , with a relatively strong ( @xmath14kev ) fek@xmath15 emission line .",
    "afterwards , ngc3281 is one of 153 galaxies of the swift / bat 9-month catalogue , and the swift / bat survey revealed here the hydrogen column density @xmath16@xmath2 and the central black hole mass @xmath17m@xmath18 @xcite .",
    "sales et al .",
    "@xcite studied ngc3281 with mid - ir spectra obtained with the gemini - south telescope .",
    "they found a very deep silicate absorption and confirmed compton - thick nature of ngc3281 .",
    "for an explanation of spectroscopic properties they suggest that ngc3281 has a dusty clumpy torus with number of clouds in equatorial radius equal to 14 and inclination angle around @xmath19 .",
    "finally , de rosa et al .",
    "@xcite obtained the value of @xmath20@xmath2 using the bepposax and integral data .    in the present work ,",
    "we use one of the new models of agn torus , the mytorus model by murphy and yaqoob @xcite , to describe the combined spectrum of the ngc3281 nucleus from integral / isgri and recent xmm - newton / epic data . being compared with models which include the partial covering absorption with additional reflection component describing reflection for compton - thick torus @xcite , this model should give us more physically reasonable parameters of dusty torus .",
    "to study x - ray emission of ngc3281 galaxy we used the 1 may 2011 xmm - newton observations ( id0650591001 , pi name : l.bassani ) during the exposure time of 23715s .",
    "data from epic cameras were processed with xmm sas ( v.11.0 ) , applying the epproc chain with standard settings . to obtain the xmm - newton spectrum we collected the photons from the source and background areas on the same ccd chip ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "after filtering the epic data set we using the m.guainazzi script to combine the spectra from 3 epic cameras into one single spectrum in 0.212.0kev range .",
    "after that , the effective duration of observations was 21848s with count - rate of 0.24cts / s .",
    "spectra are rebinned to have at least 20 counts in each spectral channel .",
    "the analysis of the reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs ) spectrum is not reported here .",
    "we also analysed all 186 pointed public observations ( on february 2013 ) by integral / isgri for ngc3281 with effective exposure time 341ks with count - rate 0.9cts / s .",
    "isgri data analysis was performed using standard procedures of osa  9.0 , the metatask ibis_science_analysis . for fitting procedure we used the ibis / isgri standard response matrix with 13 spectral channels .",
    "thus , we obtained the good quality broad band spectrum in the range of 0.2150kev .",
    "all spectral fits were performed using xspec  v.12.6.0 .",
    "the value of the intercalibration constant used in our simultaneous modelling of xmm - newton / epic and integral / isgri spectrum was in the range 1.20.9 , i.e. , within the typical range of values 2.00.5 @xcite .",
    "to reproduce the spectrum we applied two spectral models .",
    "the first model ( model a hereafter ) is based on exponentially cut - off power - law spectrum reflected from neutral material ( pexrav @xcite ) . the second one ( model b ) is based on the toroidal model of the compton - thick x - ray reprocessor ( mytorus @xcite ) . for our modelling",
    "we used the frozen value of the galactic absorption , taken from dickey & lockmann s work @xcite , i.e. @xmath21@xmath2 .",
    "we assumed a cosmological framework with @xmath22km / smpc@xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "the model a includes the following components : galactic absorption ( modelled by phabs model in xspec ) , intrinsic partially covered absorption with power law ( po@xmath26zpcfabs ) , thermal emission at soft x - rays and exponentially cut - off power - law spectrum reflected from neutral material of infinite cold slab ( pexrav @xcite ) , plus the gaussian fek@xmath27 and nik@xmath28 emission lines .",
    "the redshifted partial covering model ( ` zpcfabs ` ) is a multiplicative model defined as @xmath29\\right)\\right]+(1-f)$ ] . here , @xmath30 is the covering fraction , @xmath6 is the neutral hydrogen column density , and @xmath31 is the photo - electric cross - section .",
    "a fully covering model ( with @xmath32 ) corresponds to direct emission .",
    "the absorbed power - law model characterizes the nuclear component transmitted through a medium with column density @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath33 is the normalization of the reflected component .",
    "model a demonstrates a quite good quality of fit with @xmath34/@xmath35 .",
    "the fitting parameters of the model a are shown in table  [ tab1 ] , and in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the spectrum is shown .",
    "we have to point out that the obtained column density @xmath36@xmath2 indicates that the galaxy is probably mildly obscured sy2 @xcite , but not a compton - thick sy2 .",
    "our @xmath6 value is close to the value , obtained by winter et al .",
    "it is worth to note that the value of relative reflection @xmath37 is unphysical if related only to the geometry @xmath38 . here",
    ", @xmath39 is a solid angle .",
    "so , in this interpretation , @xmath40 lies between 0 and 1 .",
    "another explanation of high value of @xmath40 is that part of the direct emission is blocked by partially covered material with the transmission efficiency being @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "particularly , reflected material is represented as a dusty torus .",
    "additionally , note that a torus should be distributed in a clumpy structure , because torus with smooth uniform distribution can not survive close to the agn @xcite .",
    "besides , we also found thermal emission from hot diffuse gas described by mekal model with @xmath42ev , and warm absorber described by wndabs model .",
    ".parameters of spectrum with pexrav continuum model , for which @xmath43ergs / s , @xmath44ergs / s , @xmath45 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      + @xmath46 norm=[photons@xmath2s@xmath23kev@xmath47.$ ]      using the comptt model for the intrinsic continua , we can determine the plasma temperature and the optical depth , i.e. in our case @xmath48kev and @xmath49 .",
    "unfortunately , we can not apply the models of reflected spectrum from accretion disc as intrinsic continua due to parameters degeneration for the model b. but we have to note that the model b describes the spectrum above @xmath5070kev more worse than the model a. this can be due to the dominance of the disk reflection over the torus reflection on these energies . in support of this assumption , zeroth order continuum seen in fig.[fig4 ] dominates in the spectrum over the back - side reflection above @xmath51kev . taking also into account that the spectrum from the back - side reflection dominates over the inner torus wall emission below @xmath52kev",
    ", we can conclude that we can observe the appearance of a clumpy dusty torus , but not a `` classical '' homogeneous one .",
    "the mytorus model is consistent with the line emission in the compton - thick medium .",
    "thus within the model  b the line parameters were being varied independently , despite the continuum model .",
    "so , we obtained the ew and fwhm values for fek@xmath53 line ew@xmath54ev .",
    "this is slightly higher than that obtained within the model  a , but it is in a good agreement with the result of @xcite .",
    "the fwhm value is @xmath55km / s , which is also higher than the one obtained within the model a. in the same time for the nik@xmath53 line , the normalization constant in this model is almost ten times higher and equivalent width is ew@xmath56ev .",
    "this value is in a good agreement with the models of nik@xmath53 line emission for our value of the hydrogen column density along the line of sight , described in @xcite .",
    "we would like to stress that our discrepancy with the value of @xmath502.3kev obtained by vignali & comastri @xcite can be induced by the fact that they neglected the influence of absorption on fek@xmath28 line profile and intensity ( see e.g. @xcite .",
    "as we have mentioned in the introduction , in 1998 simpson @xcite found from the asca observations the ratio @xmath57@xmath2mag@xmath23 for ngc3281 , which was large comparably to the galaxy @xcite .",
    "having considered the possible explanations of the near - ir emission , he rejected the compact star formation areas and optically thin clouds in the wide emission lines area .",
    "the best hypothesis he proposed was the optically thin medium containing thick clouds .",
    "thus the torus surrounding the nucleus can be essentially inhomogeneous . afterwards sales et .",
    "@xcite confirmed the conclusions of simpson , and additionally determined the inclination of the torus @xmath19 .",
    "note that this value is close to the one obtained in our work , @xmath58 .",
    "al . also determined the relation between the inner and the outer radii of the torus , @xmath59 , where @xmath60pc .",
    "additionally , in fig.[fig5 ] we show the 70-month swift / bat crab - weighted light curve for ngc3281 in 14195kev energy range .",
    "as we can see the 14195kev count rate is strongly variable on time - scales from months to years , showing a dynamic range of about a factor of @xmath61 between the highest and the lowest count rate states .",
    "thus our results , along with the results of the previous works confirm the existence of the compton - thick clumpy dusty torus in this agn .",
    "we have analysed the broad - band 0.2150kev x - ray properties of the active galactic nucleus of sy2 galaxy ngc3281 .",
    "the observational data from xmm - newton and integral satellites give us a possibility to study the absorption features , continuum components , as well as the iron and nickel fluorescent lines fek@xmath27 and nik@xmath27 .",
    "the main results of this study can be summarized as follows :    * the obtained value of the hydrogen column density along the line of sight , @xmath62@xmath2 , confirms the compton - thick nature of ngc3281 galaxy ; * the continuum contains reflected component , possibly originated from the back - side reflection , and the zero - order continuum dominates over it in the spectrum above @xmath51kev ; * the fluorescent fek@xmath27 line demonstrates the stable flux level , as well as in the previous works @xcite",
    ".    in the same time the 70-month swift / bat lightcurve of this object demonstrates the irregular variability above 15kev , with the amplitude of @xmath61 .",
    "this can be considered as an evidence for a dusty clumpy torus .",
    "the spectral features in the mid - ir range also confirm the presence of a torus - like structure with compton - thick clouds @xcite .",
    "we also found the inclination angle between the torus polar axis and the observer s line of sight @xmath58 .",
    "this result is in a good agreement with the value obtained from the mid - ir observations @xcite .",
    "let us note that the continuum above @xmath63kev can not be described only by toroidal reprocessor model plus comptonized spectrum .",
    "in the same time the @xmath64kev spectrum can not be described only by the disk - reflected model .",
    "thus it would be very desirable to use the model containing the both .",
    "the mild broadening of the fek@xmath53 ( @xmath65ev ) and nik@xmath27 ( @xmath66ev ) emission lines corresponds to their origin inside the gas / dust torus or in its inner part , or in the outer part of the broad line region .",
    "the values of ew for each line agrees with our @xmath6 value , according to the results of modelling of line production from @xcite .    within the energy range 0.22kev the soft excess described by the thermal emission from the hot diffuse gas with @xmath42ev",
    "was disclosed .",
    "warm absorption is also present in the spectrum .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for helpful and constructive comments and suggestions . this work has used data of observations obtained with xmm - newton , an esa science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa member states and nasa and data obtained from the high energy astrophysics science archive research center ( heasarc ) provided by nasa s goddard space flight center .",
