    "properties of bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) of alkali atom gases attract a considerable current interest .",
    "recent progress in this field allows for the creating of quasi - two - dimensional atomic gas either using @xmath0 optical lattices or applying tight axial trapping ketterle , schweikhard , rychtarik , smith . it is well - known that , according to the mermin - wagner - hohenberg theorem , bose - einstein condensation is impossible in @xmath1 homogeneous systems in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "however , a bose - einstein condensation at finite temperature becomes possible in a trapped gas .",
    "recently , the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition associated with the creation of vortex - antivortex pairs was studied theoretically in @xmath2 bec clouds @xcite and it was shown that this transition can occur in the experimentally attainable range of parameters .",
    "for instance , according to ref .",
    "@xcite , bkt transition can happen at @xmath3 for the number of particles @xmath4 and realistic values of other parameters .",
    "these results demonstrate an importance of temperature effects in @xmath1 bec even at temperatures well below the critical one . at the same time",
    ", the effect of temperature on vortex lattices in bec has not been studied yet , although fluctuation of positions of vortices should become considerable even at lower temperatures than those corresponding to the bkt transition .",
    "finally , experimental evidence for the bkt transition in trapped condensates was reported in ref .",
    "recently , the effect of temperature on the vortex matter was analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite , but in the strongly fluctuative regime at relatively high temperatures , when positions of vortices are random .",
    "it is well - known from the theory of superconductivity that thermal fluctuations can lead to the melting of flux line lattice .",
    "however , in real superconductors this usually happens only in the vicinity of the critical temperature . for the case of atomic bec , critical temperature",
    "depends on the number of particles in the trap",
    ". therefore , melting can occur at temperatures much lower than the critical one .",
    "in finite systems , fluctuations of vortex positions depend also on the number of vortices . in such systems",
    ", melting temperature is not a strictly defined quantity . in this case",
    ", a characteristic temperature of the order - disorder transition ( `` melting '' ) can be defined using the lindemann criterion , see the discussion in @xcite . with increasing of the number of vortices ,",
    "the fluctuations of the vortex positions are determined by elastic shear modulus of the system , i. e. by the tkachenko modes studied in ref .",
    "however , when a vortex number is not large , quantization effects start to play a very important role and `` melting '' temperatures in this case can be much smaller than that for a larger system .",
    "thermal fluctuations of the system of interacting point particles trapped by external potential were studied before in refs .",
    "@xcite mostly by using monte - carlo simulations .",
    "if there are not many particles ( or vortices ) in the system , in the ground state , they form a cluster consisting of shells .",
    "it was shown in refs . @xcite",
    "that with increasing the temperature , first , an order between different shells is destroyed and these shells become decoupled with respect to each other . only after this , with the sufficient increase of temperature , a radial disordering of the cluster occurs .",
    "this leads to the hierarchy of `` melting '' temperatures , which depends dramatically on the symmetry of cluster and number of particles .",
    "in addition to thermal fluctuations , quantum ones can be significant in atomic condensate . in recent works @xcite , quantum and thermal fluctuations in finite vortex arrays in a one - dimensional optical lattice",
    "were considered .",
    "see also refs .",
    "@xcite for thermal fluctuations in spinor condensates .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study the intershell `` melting '' of small vortex clusters in quasi-@xmath1 bec at different number of vortices in the system .",
    "we consider the situation , when a cluster consists of only two shells .",
    "first , we find the ground state configurations of vortices and then calculate deviations of vortices from their equilibrium positions in a harmonic approximation .",
    "we show that , if the number of vortices in the inner and outer shell are not commensurate , deviations of shells with respect to each other can be very significant even at low temperatures , @xmath5 , and large number of particles in the system , and shells become decoupled with respect to each other thus leading to the disordering of the vortex cluster .",
    "also studied is the role of thermal fluctuations on the small cluster , consisting on @xmath6 , @xmath7 , or @xmath8 vortices , in a trap with a small _ quadrupole deformation _ , which acts as a source of orientational pinning for the cluster .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present our model , which allows one to find an energetically favorable vortex configuration in the @xmath2 case and also to calculate semi - quantitatively deviations of vortex positions due to the thermal fluctuations .",
    "in section iii we study the intershell `` melting '' process in different two - shells vortex clusters and obtain a order - disorder transition temperature . in section",
    "iv we analyze the effect of thermal fluctuations on vortices in the trap with a small quadrupole deformation .",
    "we conclude in sec . v.",
    "consider quasi - two - dimensional condensate with @xmath9 particles confined by the radial harmonic trapping potential @xmath10where @xmath11 is a trapping frequency , @xmath12 is the mass of the atom , and @xmath13 is the radial coordinate . the system is rotated with the angular velocity @xmath14 . in this paper , we restrict ourselves on the range of temperatures much smaller than @xmath15 . therefore , we can neglect a noncondensate contribution to the free energy of the system .",
    "thus , the energy functional reads @xmath16where the integration is performed over the area of the system , @xmath17 is the polar angle , @xmath18 is the number of condensed atoms , @xmath14 is the rotation frequency , @xmath19 is the interaction parameter , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the scattering length and oscillator length ( @xmath22 ) in @xmath23-direction , which is kinematically frozen .",
    "distances and rotation frequencies are measured in units of the radial oscillator length and the trapping frequency , respectively .",
    "the normalization condition for the order parameter reads @xmath24 . in this paper",
    ", we analyze the case of dilute bec and take @xmath25 , which corresponds to @xmath26 khz at @xmath27 for @xmath28rb ( @xmath29 nm ) .",
    "since we consider the range of low temperatures , @xmath30 , we can assume that @xmath31 .",
    "for the dependence of @xmath15 on @xmath9 , we use the ideal gas result for the 2d case :    @xmath32    where @xmath33  is a riemann zeta function , @xmath34 .",
    "( 3 ) remains accurate even for the case of interacting particles gies .",
    "now we present a method allowing one to find a ground state of the system , which corresponds to the certain vortex cluster , and deviations of vortices from their equilibrium positions due to thermal fluctuations .    _ in general case _ , @xmath35 can be represented as a fourier expansion@xmath36let us denote a number of vortices in the system as @xmath37 . if the superfluid phase in bec has a @xmath38-fold symmetry , than only terms with @xmath39 s divisible by @xmath38 survive in expansion ( 4 ) .",
    "for instance , a vortex cluster consisting of a single ring of @xmath37 vortices corresponds to the expansion ( 4 ) with @xmath40 , @xmath37 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , .... a two - shell cluster with @xmath43 and @xmath44 vortices in the shells ( @xmath45 ) , where @xmath44  is divisible by @xmath46 , corresponds to the expansion ( 4 ) with @xmath40 , @xmath43 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , ... if @xmath44  is not divisible by @xmath43 , than , in general case , expansion ( 4 ) contains all harmonics .",
    "typically , main contribution to the energy is given by just few harmonics and by taking into account approximately ten of them , one can find the energy of the system with very high accuracy provided that the number of vortices in the cloud is not too large , @xmath49 .    in the limit of noninteracting gas ( @xmath50 )",
    ", it follows from the gross - pitaevskii equation that each function @xmath51 coincides with the eigen function for the harmonic oscillator corresponding to the angular momentum @xmath39 .",
    "these functions have the gaussian profile @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , one can assume that this gaussian approximation remains accurate in the case of weakly interacting dilute gas .",
    "the accuracy can be improved if we introduce a variational parameter @xmath53 characterizing the spatial extent of @xmath51 .",
    "finally , our _ ansatz _ for @xmath51 has a form : @xmath54where @xmath55 , @xmath53 , and @xmath56 can be found from the condition of minimum of the energy ( 2 ) , @xmath55 is a real number .",
    "this approach was used for the first time in ref .",
    "@xcite to evaluate energies and density plots of different vortex configurations . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the simplified version of this method with fixed values of @xmath57 was applied for the limit of weakly interacting gas with taking into account up to @xmath58 terms in the expansion ( 4 ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the results for such approximate solutions to the gross - pitaevskii equation were compared with some known results of numerical solutions .",
    "a good accuracy of the ansatz was revealed .",
    "see also ref .",
    "@xcite with the related approach . in ref .",
    "pogosov , a version of this method was also used to calculate the energy of axially - symmetric vortex phases in spinor condensates with the comparison of the obtained results with numerical solutions , and a good agreement was found . therefore , this method can be also applied for our problem and we expect that the results must be semi - quantitatively accurate and with the help of this model one can reveal the effect of symmetry of vortex cluster on melting temperatures and estimate values of those temperatures .",
    "now we substitute eqs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 5 ) to eq . ( 2 ) and after the integration we obtain :     @xmath59where @xmath60@xmath61@xmath62@xmath63 is a gamma function .",
    "normalization condition is now given by @xmath64values of parameters @xmath53 , @xmath55  and @xmath56  can be found from the minimum of the energy ( 6 ) taking into account eq .",

    "note that the energy is proportional to @xmath69 at given values of @xmath14  and @xmath70 .      after finding of ground state values of variational parameters ,",
    "one can calculate the equilibrium positions of vortices @xmath71 , @xmath72 by numerical solution of equation     @xmath73    where we introduced a notation @xmath74 for the set of all variational parameters ( @xmath53 , @xmath55  and @xmath56 ) and @xmath75  denotes ground state values of these parameters . fluctuations of @xmath76 , which are the degrees of freedom for the system in this model , lead to the fluctuations of vortex positions .",
    "we denote deviations of variational parameters from their equilibrium values as @xmath77 and express deviations of vortices @xmath78 and @xmath79 through deviations of variational parameters in a linear approximation .",
    "perturbed positions of vortices are determined by the equation @xmath80    finally , deviation of the position of a given vortex from the equilibrium is@xmath81@xmath82    here and below repeated indices are summed ; @xmath83 ,  @xmath84 , and @xmath85  are given by    @xmath86    @xmath87    @xmath88    all the derivatives on @xmath76 , @xmath13 , and @xmath17  in eqs .",

    "the averaged squared deviations of radial and polar coordinates of two vortices with respect to each other due to thermal fluctuations are given by    @xmath100    @xmath101    in general case , integrals in eqs .",
    "( 24 ) and ( 25 ) can not be calculated analytically , since matrix @xmath102 is not necessarily diagonal .",
    "therefore , we have to switch to a new basis @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is a matrix , which diagonalizes quadratic form ( 22 ) . here and below we will use a matrix form for the equations .",
    "quadratic forms ( 18 ) , ( 19 ) , ( 22 ) in the new basis can be written as@xmath105@xmath106@xmath107where @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 .",
    "matrix @xmath111 must be diagonal and from this condition one can find matrix @xmath104 numerically and then calculate @xmath112  and @xmath113 .",
    "in the new basis , integrals in eqs . ( 24 ) and ( 25 ) can be found analytically and finally we get : @xmath114@xmath115as usual in a harmonic approximation , average squares of deviations are proportional to the temperature .    for the vortex cluster consisting of two shells",
    "we also introduce a quantity @xmath116 , which has a sense of averaged displacement of vortex shells with respect to each other .",
    "it can be defined as a root of square displacement of pair of vortices from different shells averaged over all possible pairs of vortices : @xmath117 ^{1/2}. \\label{32}\\]]now , if we take into account eq .",
    "( 31 ) and the fact that energy in the ground state is proportional to @xmath69 , we obtain the following relation :    @xmath118    where @xmath119 is a reduced temperature , @xmath120 ; function @xmath121  depends on interaction constant @xmath70  and rotation speed @xmath14 .",
    "of course , @xmath121 is also very strongly dependent on the vortex cluster symmetry and in the next section we will calculate it for some values of @xmath70  and @xmath14 and vortex configurations .",
    "note that the harmonic approximation remains accurate only if the deviations of the positions of vortices are much smaller than the characteristic distance between two neighboring vortices .",
    "the `` melting '' temperature can be defined through the lindemann criterion .",
    "if there are not many vortices in the system , they are situated in concentric shells . in the single vortex state",
    ", a vortex occupies the center of the cloud .",
    "if the number of vortices @xmath37 is more than one , but less than six , vortices are arranged in one shell . with",
    "further increasing of number of vortices , one of the vortices jumps to the center of the cloud , whereas others are still situated in the single shell @xcite .",
    "thermal fluctuations in these cases can lead only to the radial displacements of vortex positions , since there is only one shell in the system .",
    "however , when the number of vortices is increased , they are arranged in two shells .",
    "for instance , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , that in the phase with ten vortices , two of them are situated in the inner shell and eight are arranged in the outer shell . for phases with larger amount of vortices ,",
    "their number in the inner shell can increase .    here",
    ", we consider the process of the intershell disordering in two - shells clusters containing @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 vortices , respectively",
    ". it would be more convenient for the comparison to calculate `` melting '' temperatures for these configurations at the same value of rotation frequency .",
    "however , only one of these states can be a true ground state and if the system is not in a ground state , than sooner or later it will switch to the ground state due to thermal fluctuations .",
    "therefore , we find `` melting '' temperatures for different vortex configurations at different , but quite close to each other rotation speeds , which correspond to ground states of the given configuration .",
    "we choose the value of the gas parameter @xmath25 , as was explained in section ii , and find the ground states of the system .",
    "we have obtained that a two - shells vortex clusters consisting of @xmath126 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 vortices are energetically favorable in the vicinity of the point @xmath127 .",
    "for instance , the ground state of the system is represented by phases with @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 vortices at @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 , respectively . in these cases ,",
    "the inner shells contain @xmath132 , @xmath7 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 vortices , whereas the outer shells have @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath58 , and @xmath58 vortices , respectively .",
    "density plots for these vortex phases are shown in fig .",
    "1 . let s calculate deviations of vortex positions for these states .    using a technique presented in the previous section",
    ", we found that if we increase the temperature from zero , at first , fluctuations of relative phases @xmath56 of different harmonics of the order parameter becomes important and deviations of the positions of vortices are almost entirely due to the fluctuations of @xmath56 and not due to fluctuations of @xmath55 and @xmath53 .",
    "this can be expected , since it is well - known that fluctuations of the phase of the order parameter are more pronounced at relatively low temperatures and only at much higher temperatures an amplitude of the order parameter starts to fluctuate .",
    "also , fluctuations of @xmath56  lead predominantly to azimuthal displacements of vortices , displacements in a radial direction are much smaller .",
    "this reflects the fact that the temperature of the intershell melting is much lower than that of the radial melting .",
    "we define an intershell melting temperature @xmath135 of the cluster as a temperature , at which @xmath116 is equal to @xmath136 , where @xmath137 is a characteristic number from the lindemann criterion :    @xmath138    factor @xmath139 in eq .",
    "( 33 ) reflects the fact that the two - shell cluster is invariant under the rotation of shells with respect to each other on angle @xmath140 .",
    "we have calculated values of @xmath141 for clusters with @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 vortices .",
    "our results are @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 , and @xmath145 for @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 vortex clusters , respectively .",
    "we can see that @xmath122 and @xmath124 vortex clusters are most stable among the analyzed configurations , and average angle between the shells is less than in other cases . this is because the number of vortices in the outer shell @xmath44 is divisible by @xmath43 .",
    "intuitively , it is clear that the stability of a cluster with @xmath44 divisible by @xmath43 depends also on the ratio @xmath146 , since in the limit @xmath147 , each vortex in the inner shell corresponds to one vortex from the outer shell .",
    "probably , this is a reason , why @xmath124-vortex cluster is more stable than @xmath122-vortex configuration . at the same time ,",
    "@xmath123 and @xmath125-vortex clusters are the most unstable among considered here , since @xmath44 and @xmath43 are incommensurate , and a deviation of shells with respect to each other is the largest . note that with changing of @xmath14 with fixed @xmath70 , @xmath148 increases , in accordance with calculations @xcite for tkachenko modes .",
    "one can see from eq .",
    "( 34 ) and our estimates for @xmath148 that @xmath124-vortex cluster is not melted and remains stable at @xmath149 and @xmath150 , whereas in other cases a displacement angle between different shells is comparable with the angle between the two neighboring vortices in the outer shell and therefore the shells are decoupled .",
    "the difference in melting temperatures for 12- and 11-vortex clusters is several orders of magnitude .",
    "experimentally , melting of vortex clusters can be studied by tuning of @xmath151 at fixed @xmath70 and @xmath9 . after obtaining a desirable vortex configuration ,",
    "one can also tune @xmath152  and reach a `` melting '' range of temperatures .",
    "vortex positions can be found by the free expansion technique and after the repeating of this procedure one can determine the average deviation of the vortex positions from the equilibrium .",
    "it is also possible to use a bragg spectroscopy for the systems containing much larger vortex arrays than those considered here .",
    "in this section we consider the effect of thermal fluctuations on vortices in the trap with a quadrupole deformation , which breaks a rotational symmetry .",
    "such a deformation is often used in experiments to facilitate the creation of vortices .",
    "in fact , it introduces a preferable direction for the arrangements of vortices acting as a source of orientational pinning for a vortex cluster .",
    "the additional quadrupolar pinning potential is given by@xmath153where @xmath154 is a small coefficient , @xmath155 .",
    "at zero temperature quadrupole deformation of the trap potential fixes azimuthal positions of vortices , whereas thermal fluctuations lead to displacements of vortices , which depend on @xmath154 and @xmath152 . note that , in the case of a two - shell cluster at @xmath156 , considered in the previous section , pinning centers are created by each vortex shell for another shell , and the total rotational symmetry is preserved .",
    "additional potential ( 34 ) leads to the following contribution to the energy ( 6 ) :    @xmath157    this term relates phases and amplitudes of different harmonics of the order parameter with angular momenta different by @xmath6 from each other .",
    "here we analyze the situation , when there are @xmath158 , @xmath7 or @xmath8 vortices in the trap .",
    "density plots for these vortex states are presented in fig .",
    "the direction of minimum of trapping potential is vertical .",
    "we found that at small quadrupole deformation , @xmath159 , fluctuations of relative phases of the order parameter furrier harmonics are much stronger than fluctuations of their amplitudes , similarly to the case considered in the previous section .",
    "therefore , we apply the same ideas to the present problem . fluctuations of the relative phases lead mostly to the displacements of vortices in the azimuthal direction .",
    "these are so called scissors modes , which are responsible for such oscillations stringari , foot , zaremba , castin .    in the limit of small @xmath154",
    ", one can consider @xmath160 as a perturbation to the energy of the system with @xmath156 .",
    "if there are two vortices in the system , the nonperturbed order parameter contains all harmonics divisible by @xmath6 , and the main contribution to the energy is given by harmonics with @xmath40 and @xmath6 .",
    "amplitudes of these harmonics are of @xmath161 order of magnitude , relative angles between them are fixed , and the energy is degenerate with respect to @xmath162 , which reflects the fact that vortices can rotate freely ( goldstone mode ) .",
    "quadrupole deformation connects @xmath163 and @xmath162 , @xmath162 and @xmath164 , @xmath164 and @xmath165 , etc .. as a result , @xmath166 @xmath167 and the angle of deviation of vortex cluster due to thermal fluctuations is given by @xmath168where @xmath121  is a function , independent on @xmath119 ; @xmath169 .",
    "if there are @xmath8 vortices in the system , than at @xmath156 the order parameter contains all the harmonics divisible by @xmath8 .",
    "however , these harmonics can not be related through the eq .",
    "( 35 ) , since their angular momenta should differ by @xmath6 and not by @xmath8 . in this case ,",
    "coupling of vortex cluster to the quadrupole deformations occurs in the next order of @xmath170 .",
    "namely , quadrupole deformation induces a harmonic with @xmath171 , whose amplitude is of the order of @xmath167 , and finally @xmath172 @xmath173 ; and we again arrive to eq .",
    "( 36 ) with @xmath174 .",
    "now we consider the situation , when there are @xmath7 vortices in the system .",
    "again , a nonperturbed order parameter consists of contributions with @xmath39 s divisible by @xmath7 , and their phases are not related by eq .",
    "( 35 ) , as in the previous case with @xmath8 vortices . in the next approximation with respect to @xmath170 ,",
    "quadrupole deformation induces other harmonics with all integer @xmath39 s , and amplitudes of these harmonics are of the order of @xmath175 .",
    "this is possible , because any integer @xmath39 , which is not divisible by @xmath7 , can be represented as @xmath176 , and therefore it can be obtained by adding or substraction @xmath6 from @xmath177 .",
    "however , it turns out that the energy even in the second order of @xmath154 is again degenerate and this degeneracy is removed only in the next order of @xmath154 .",
    "after all , @xmath166 @xmath178 and eqs .",
    "( 36 ) is again valid but with @xmath179 .",
    "we see that the symmetry of the vortex configuration dictates the asymptotic behavior of the pinning energy and the average deviation of vortex cluster at @xmath180 .",
    "the cluster with @xmath6 vortices is most strongly pinned , whereas the cluster with @xmath7 vortices is the most unstable .",
    "this effect reflects the commensurability of the angular momenta of the quadrupole deformation ( @xmath171 ) and of the order parameter harmonics , responsible for vortices ( @xmath171 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) .",
    "the strongest pinning is observed , when these momenta are equal to each other ( two - vortex state ) , less stronger pinning , when these momenta are commensurate , but not equal ( four - vortex phase ) , and the most weak pinning for incommensurate case ( three - vortex state ) .",
    "note that similar scaling relations for the frequences of scissors modes in @xmath6 and @xmath7 vortex states were obtained recently in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "next we calculate values of @xmath121 for @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 vortex cluster at @xmath25 and @xmath181 , @xmath182 , and @xmath183 , respectively , where these vortex configurations are energetically favorable , according to our calculations .",
    "our results are @xmath184 , @xmath185 , and @xmath186 for @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 vortex states , respectively .",
    "if the deviation angle @xmath187 becomes of the same order as the angle between two neighboring vortices in the cluster , @xmath188 , we will treat this vortex cluster as being depinned from the quadrupole deformation . by using eq .",
    "( 36 ) and this condition , one can easily obtain phase diagram in the @xmath189 @xmath190 space .",
    "the example of the phase diagram is presented on fig . 3 for @xmath25 and @xmath27 .",
    "each line determines the boundary between the pinned and unpinned vortex cluster for a given vortex configuration . below these lines ,",
    "vortex cluster is pinned and above it is unpinned .",
    "one can see that the region of stability of @xmath6-vortex cluster is much broader than that for two other configurations .",
    "in this paper , we studied the effect of thermal fluctuations on small vortex clusters in harmonically trapped rotating bose - einstein condensate at temperatures much lower than the critical temperature .",
    "first , we have considered the clusters , consisting of two concentric shells of vortices . these were @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 vortex structures .",
    "we obtained that with increasing the temperature from zero , first , an order between the positions of vortices from different shells is destroyed , whereas the order within each shell is preserved . by using a lindemann criterion , we defined the temperature , corresponding to the decoupling of two shells of vortices with respect to each other , which determines an order - disorder transition .",
    "this `` melting '' temperature is strongly dependent on the commensurability of the number of vortices in shells ; less commensurate clusters have lower `` melting '' temperature .",
    "for instance , the `` melting '' temperatures for the @xmath123-vortex cluster consisting of two shells with @xmath7 and @xmath134 vortices and for the commensurate @xmath124-vortex cluster with @xmath7 and @xmath58 vortices in shells differ in several orders of magnitude .",
    "intershell order - disorder transition can be observed at experimentally attainable range of parameters .",
    "_ we have shown that intershell melting in atomic condensates can occur at very low temperatures , especially for incommensurate clusters .",
    "_    also studied are vortex clusters in the trap with small quadrupole deformation of the trapping potential , which acts as an orientational pinning center for vortices .",
    "we have analyzed the case of @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 vortices in the system .",
    "we have demonstrate that the pinning energy depends very strongly on the number of vortices in the system . with tending the quadrupole deformation @xmath154 to zero ,",

    "this is due to the commensurability between the angular momenta @xmath171 transferred to the system by the quadrupole deformation and @xmath171 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 , responsible for the creation of @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 vortices , respectively .",
