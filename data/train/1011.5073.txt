    "initial heavy quark production during hard parton interactions in nucleon - nucleon scatterings and secondary production during the evolution of the qgp are studied .",
    "we use the event generator pythia @xcite to determine the initial heavy quark distributions , which agree with the experimental data from phenix @xcite . nevertheless , these distributions have large uncertainties due to their sensitivity on the parton distribution functions in nucleons , the heavy quark masses as well as the renormalization and factorization scales ( see @xcite for a detailed analysis ) . for the initial distribution of the gluonic medium",
    "we use three different approaches : the mini - jet model , a color glass condensate inspired model and also pythia in combination with the glauber model .       of heavy quarks with pseudo - rapidity @xmath86 at the end of the qgp phase for au+au collisions at rhic with an impact parameter of @xmath87 .",

    "however , compared to the initial yield these values are of the order of a few percent for the most probable scenarios .",
    "therefore , one can conclude that charm production at rhic in the qgp is nearly negligible .    at lhc , however , the picture looks a bit different : here the charm production in the qgp is a sizeable fraction of the initial yield and is even of the same order for some scenarios ( with mini - jet initial conditions for gluons with a high energy density ) . in numbers , between 11 and 55 charm pairs are produced in the qgp .",
    "bottom production in the qgp , however is very small both at rhic and lhc and can be safely neglected . as a consequence ,",
    "all bottom quarks at these colliders are produced in initial hard parton scatterings .",
    "the elliptic flow and the nuclear modification factor @xmath92 ( @xmath93 and @xmath94 are the momenta in @xmath95 and @xmath70 direction in respect to the reaction plane ) of heavy quarks at mid - rapidity are observables which are experimentally measurable and reflect the coupling of heavy quarks to the medium .",
    "a large elliptic flow comparable to that of light partons indicates a strong coupling to the medium . on the other hand",
    "a small @xmath21 is a sign for a large energy loss of heavy quarks .",
    "experimental results reveal that both quantities are on the same order as the respective values for light particles @xcite .",
    "as we have recently shown @xcite elastic scatterings of heavy quarks with the gluonic medium using a constant coupling @xmath96 and the debye mass for screening the @xmath97 channel can not reproduce the experimentally measured elliptic flow . in order to explain the data one would need a @xmath98 times larger cross section than the leading order one .",
    "of course , this @xmath17 factor is too large to represent the contribution of higher order corrections .",
    "however , as we demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite and is shown in the following , the discrepancy with the data can be lowered  even on the leading order level  by a factor of 10 by taking the running of the coupling into account and by improving the incorporation of debye screening .",
    "the remaining factor of 4 difference could then indeed stem from neglecting higher order effects , which , however , must be checked in a future project .",
    "the following calculations are done analogously to @xcite .",
    "an effective running coupling is obtained from measurements of @xmath99 annihilation and non - strange hadronic decays of @xmath100 leptons @xcite .    since the @xmath97 channel of the @xmath101 cross section is divergent it is screened with a mass proportional to the debye mass , which is calculated by the common definition @xmath102 with the running coupling . the proportionality factor @xmath103 of screening mass and debye mass",
    "is mostly set to 1 in the literature without a sophisticated reason .",
    "however , one can fix this factor to @xmath104 by comparing the @xmath105 of the born cross section with @xmath103 to the energy loss within the hard thermal loop approach to @xmath106 @xcite .          these improvements lead to an enhanced cross section which also increases the elliptic flow .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : v2 ] shows @xmath1 as a function of the transverse momentum @xmath108 for the leading order cross section without any improvements , with the running coupling , with the corrected debye screening and with both modifications .",
    "the elliptic flow of the latter reproduces the order of magnitude of the data , if the cross section is multiplied with @xmath107 , which is much smaller than the previous employed @xmath109 and lies in a region which could account for higher order corrections .",
    "however , one has to check if these corrections have indeed a similar effect as a constant @xmath17 factor of 4 .",
    "therefore , the calculation of the next - to - leading order cross section is planned for the near future and will complement @xmath0 interactions for gluons , which are already implemented in bamps @xcite .",
    "the shapes of the theoretical curve and of the data points are , however , slightly different .",
    "this is an effect of hadronization and decay to electrons , which is not shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : v2 ] .",
    "if one takes those two effects into account , the agreement of the data and the theoretically curve is much better , in particular for high @xmath108 ( see right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : v2 ] ) .",
    "we performed the fragmentation of charm ( bottom ) quarks to @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) mesons via peterson fragmentation @xcite and used pythia for the decay to electrons . at low",
    "@xmath108 the agreement between the theoretical curve and data becomes worse , since peterson fragmentation is not the correct model here and coalescence may play a role .",
