    "when a high - energy electron emits a soft photon via bremsstrahlung , the process occurs over a rather long distance , known as the formation length .",
    "if anything happens to an electron or a photon while traveling this distance , the emission can be disrupted .",
    "landau and pomeranchuk were the first who showed that if the formation length of bremsstrahlung becomes comparable to the distance over which a multiple scattering becomes important , the bremsstrahlung will be suppressed @xcite .",
    "migdal @xcite , @xcite developed a quantitative theory of this phenomenon .",
    "side by side with the multiple scattering of emitting electron one has to take into account also an influence of a medium on radiated electromagnetic field .",
    "since long distances are essential in the problem under consideration this can be done by introducing dielectric constant @xmath0 .",
    "this effect leads also to suppression of the soft photon emission ( ter - mikaelian effect , see in @xcite ) .",
    "a clear qualitative analysis of different mechanisms of suppression is presented in @xcite,@xcite .",
    "more simple derivation of the migdal s results is given in @xcite .",
    "the next step in a quantitative theory of lpm effect was made in @xcite .",
    "this theory is based on the quasiclassical operator method in qed developed by authors @xcite , @xcite .",
    "one of the basic equations ( obtained with use of kinetic equations describing a motion of electron in a medium in the presence of external field ) is the schrdinger equation in external field with imaginary potential ( eq.(3.3),@xcite ) .",
    "the same equation ( without external field ) was rederived recently in @xcite .",
    "the last derivation is based on the approach results of which is coincide basically with the operator quasiclassical method . in @xcite",
    "a new calculation approach is developed where multiple scattering is described with the path integral treatment .",
    "new activity with the theory of lpm effect is connected with a very successful series of experiments @xcite - @xcite performed at slac during last years ( see in this connection @xcite ) . in these experiments",
    "the cross section of bremsstrahlung of soft photons with energy from 200  kev to 500  mev from electrons with energy 8  gev and 25  gev is measured with an accuracy of the order of a few percent .",
    "both lpm and dielectric suppression is observed and investigated .",
    "these experiments are the challenge for the theory since in all the mentioned papers calculations are performed to logarithmic accuracy which is not enough for description of the new experiment .",
    "the contribution of the coulomb corrections ( at least for heavy elements ) is larger then experimental errors and these corrections should be taken into account .    in the present paper we calculated the cross section of bremsstrahlung process with term @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is characteristic logarithm of the problem , and with the coulomb corrections taken into account ( section 2 and",
    "appendix a ) .",
    "this cross section is valid for very high energies when the lpm effect manifest itself for a photon energy of the order of an energy of the initial electron . in the photon energy region , where the lpm effect is `` turned off ''",
    ", our cross section gives the exact bethe - heitler cross section ( within power accuracy ) with coulomb corrections .",
    "this important feature was absent in the previous calculations .",
    "the polarization of a medium is incorporated into this approach ( section 3 ) . the considerable contribution into the soft part of the investigated in the experiment spectrum of radiation",
    "gives a photon emission on the boundaries of a target .",
    "we calculated this contribution taking into account the multiple scattering and polarization of a medium for the case when a target is much thicker than the formation length of the radiation ( section 4 ) . in section 5",
    "we considered a case when a target is much thinner than the formation length . in this case",
    "the cross section has multiplicative form ( probability of radiation times cross section of scattering for the given impact parameter ) . in section 6 a case of an intermediate thickness of a target ( between cases of a thick and a thin target ) is analyzed , polarization of a medium is not included . in section 7 a qualitative picture of a spectral curve ( an effective thickness of a target , position of a minimum ) is discussed . in section 8 we compare the theoretical curve for the intensity spectrum with the data .",
    "although agreement between experiment and theory is rather satisfactory , an additional analysis should be done to obtain information about an accuracy of agreement between experimental data and theory .",
    "as well known ( see , e.g. @xcite , sec.93 ) the formation length of radiation is ( in this paper the system @xmath3 is used ) @xmath4 where   @xmath5  is the energy of the initial electron ,  @xmath6   is the energy of radiated photon , @xmath7   is the angle between momenta of the photon and the initial electron .",
