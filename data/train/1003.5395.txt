    "the past few years have witnessed a spectacular progress in the fabrication and exploration of nano - structures giving experimentalists unprecedented control over the microscopic parameters governing the physics of these systems .",
    "nano - structures , beyond their practical applications , display an array of emergent phenomena stemming from their reduced dimensionality which enhances quantum fluctuations and strong correlations .",
    "often , experiments are carried out under non - equilibrium conditions , with currents passing through the structures .",
    "the measurements are performed over a wide range of parameters , such as temperature and applied bias , allowing experimental exploration of the interplay between non - equilibrium dynamics and strong correlation physics @xcite .",
    "a canonical example is the non - equilibrium kondo effect observed in a quantum dot attached to two leads held at different chemical potentials @xmath1 .",
    "the voltage difference @xmath2 induces a non - equilibrium current @xmath3 through the dot , interfering with and eventually destroying the kondo effect as the voltage is increased .",
    "the standard theoretical description of the transport trough a quantum dot is the two - lead anderson impurity model under a bias voltage .",
    "the 1- or 2-lead hamiltonian at zero bias is exactly solvable via bethe ansatz @xcite . using this exact solution as well as nrg calculations for example , the thermodynamics of the model",
    "have been studied in great detail .",
    "but the non - equilibrium situation , namely when the two leads experience each a different chemical potential , is much more difficult .",
    "this is due to the subtle interplay between the non - equilibrium aspect of the problem on one hand and the presence of strong interactions on the other hand . technically speaking it is very non trivial task to find a basis of states that diagonalize simultaneously the voltage term and the interaction term in the hamiltonian",
    "nevertheless , a lot of efforts have been put forward to study this model but so far , only approximate ways of dealing with the voltage and/or the interactions have been developed@xcite .    in this paper we develop a _",
    "phenomenological _ approach to the problem , based on the scattering bethe ansatz ( sba ) , recently developed by p. mehta and n. andrei ( ma ) @xcite , a non - perturbative implementation of the keldysh formalism to construct the current - carrying , _ open - system _ scattering eigenstates for the two - lead nonequilibrium anderson impurity mode .",
    "the basic idea of the sba is to construct scattering eigenstates of the full hamiltonian defined directly on the infinite line and match the incoming states by two fermi seas describing the initial state of the leads .",
    "the non - equilibrium steady state transport properties of the system are then expressed as expectation values of the current or dot occupation operators in these eigenstates .",
    "this program has been implemented for the interacting resonance level model ( irlm ) , a spinless interacting model , described in ref .   where the zero temperature results for current and dot occupation @xmath4 for all bias voltages were presented .",
    "another exact solution of this model at the so - called self - dual point @xcite by e. boulat , h. saleur and p. schmitteckert in refs .   uses conformal field theory techniques and compares successfully with t - dmrg results .",
    "the main motivation of the present paper is to test the very interesting ideas behind the sba framework on a physically more relevant model such as the anderson impurity model and to focus on the phenomenology that can be extracted from it . carrying out the program for the non - equilibrium anderson model we find difficulties in the direct application of the sba approach due to the fact that the ground state in the bethe basis consists of bound pairs of quasi - particles , leading to problems in the computation of the scattering phase shifts for the quasi - particles with complex momenta .",
    "this problem is not present in the irlm when the bethe momenta are below the impurity level and no bound states can be formed .",
    "we circumvent this difficulty by means of the following argument : the transport property computed in the irlm is related to the single particle phase shift across the impurity in the bethe basis .",
    "based on the same idea we develop a phenomenological approach to describe the transport property in the anderson impurity model .",
    "we identify two types of possible phase shifts across impurity , which we refer to as `` spin - fluctuation '' and `` charge - fluctuation '' types to label two phenomenological phase shifts akin to the fundamental excitations described in the traditional bethe ansatz in this model .",
    "the phenomenological ansatz is checked against exact results on the dot occupation in equilibrium and the friedel sum rule  @xcite , in the linear response regime .",
    "subsequently , we discuss our results for the out of equilibrium current , conductance and dot occupation .",
    "the scaling relations for the conductance , predicted from the fermi liquid picture of the problem at strong and weak coupling , are also discussed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start with a formal construction of scattering eigenstates in the two - lead anderson impurity model .",
    "then we discuss how we impose boundary conditions , which serve as initial condition in the time dependent picture , on the electrons within the leads .",
    "next we shall discuss our results for the dot occupation in equilibrium and the conductance in the linear response regime .",
    "based on the checks in equilibrium we then extend our computation to the out of equilibrium regime .",
    "the difficulty we encounter for complex momenta and the way we handle it will also be addressed there .",
    "comparison with another attempt of exact solution for this model by r. m. konik et al .",
    "@xcite with the idea of dressed excitations above fermi energy in the bethe ansatz picture , first considered for the exact conductance of point contact device in the fqhe regime@xcite , will be discussed .",
    "we will also comment on the validity and implication of our numerical results , among them the charge susceptibility , in the out - of - equilibrium regime .",
    "qualitative agreement between our theory and experimental result is then presented .",
    "the limit of @xmath5 is also summarized in the last section based on the same phenomenological approach .",
    "finally , we summarize our results and conclude with some issues on the sba approach to this model , and state how they could be overcome .",
    "in this section we apply the sba approach to construct the scattering states of the full hamiltonian .",
    "the ( unfolded ) 2-lead anderson impurity hamiltonian reads , @xmath6 where summation over the spin indices @xmath7 is implied .",
    "the fields @xmath8 describe chiral , right - moving electrons from lead @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the on - site coulomb repulsion between electrons on the dot , @xmath11 is the coupling between the dot and the lead @xmath9 , and @xmath12 is the gate voltage .",
    "we have set the fermi velocity @xmath13 .",
    "the model s equilibrium properties have been studied in great detail via the traditional thermodynamic bethe ansatz ( tba)@xcite .",
    "the sba exploits in a new way the integrability of the anderson model to construct current - carrying scattering eigenstates on the open line .",
    "there are two main requirements : one is the construction of scattering eigenstates with the number of electrons in each lead conserved prior to scattering off the impurity .",
    "another is the asymptotic boundary condition : that the wave function of the incoming electrons , i.e. in the region ( @xmath14 ) , tend to that of two free fermi seas far from the impurity @xcite .",
    "all information about the external bias applied to the system is encoded in the boundary condition by appropriately choosing the chemical potential of the incoming fermi seas .",
    "as in all bethe - ansatz constructions , the full multi - particle wavefunction is constructed from single particle eigenstates ( now on the infinite open line ) and the appropriate two - particle s - matrices .",

    "the @xmath34 term in the even channel wave function is introduced in order to modify the original ( when @xmath27 ) single particle phase shift across the impurity .",

    "since the s - matrix is the same for all even - odd combinations the s - matrix does not depend on the lead index @xmath9 , and the number of electrons in a lead , @xmath68 , can change only at the impurity site .",
    "this circumstance allows us to construct the fully - interacting eigenstates of our hamiltonian characterized by the incoming quantum numbers , @xmath69 and @xmath70 the numbers of incident electrons from lead 1 and 2 respectively .",
    "these quantum numbers are subsequently determined by the chemical potentials @xmath71 and @xmath72 .    to complete the construction of the sba current - carrying , scattering eigenstate , @xmath73",
    ", we must still choose the `` bethe - ansatz momenta '' @xmath74 of the single particles states to ensure that the incoming particles look like two fermi seas in the region @xmath44 .",
    "this requirement translates into a set of `` free - field '' sba equations for the bethe - ansatz momenta - density of the particles from the two leads @xcite .",
    "the argument is as follows : away from the impurity @xmath75 reduces to @xmath76 with the inter - particle s - matrix eq .",
    "( [ smatu ] ) present .",
    "thus the scattering eigenstates describing non - interacting electrons are in the bethe basis rather than in the fock basis of plane waves .",

    "each member of a pair can be either in lead @xmath51 or in lead @xmath84 , since the s - matrix is unity in the lead space .",

    "the other possibility , which is perhaps more intuitive in comparing with the free electron in the fock basis , is to include only @xmath88 .",
    "these two types of states give the same results when evaluating the expectation value of the dot occupation in equilibrium .",
    "however when we turn on the bias voltage , the results obtained from a 4-bound states description show some charge fluctuations even way below the impurity level which is not expected from the non - interacting ( @xmath89 ) theory ( shown in appendix  [ a ] ) .",
    "thus we shall disregard the 4-bound states solution on physical grounds and focus on the 2-bound states description in the following discussion .    to describe in the bethe basis the two leads as two fermi seas filled up to @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively",
