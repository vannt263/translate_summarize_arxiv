    "( [ df ] ) , it is clear that this is independent of the simplifying assumption _ ii _ ) above .",
    "also , such sign definiteness holds only for process ( [ proc ] ) , assuming universality between initial and final leptons @xmath79 or @xmath80 , and not for the the process @xmath81 , where additional assumptions on the fermion coupling constants would be needed .",
    "the deviation of @xmath46 in ( [ afb ] ) from the sm prediction , @xmath82 , has a similar expression : @xmath83 and at lep2 it generally has the same negative sign property for arbitrary leptonic @xmath1 couplings as the cross section @xmath60 .",
    "such sign property of @xmath1 effects for these observables can be used to attempt a model - independent distinction of the @xmath1 from analogous anomalous gauge coupling effects , if some deviations were observed .    concerning the forward - backward asymmetry ( [ afb ] ) , the deviation from the sm prediction is expressed as @xmath84\\chi_{z'}\\ ] ] and , in contrast to the case of @xmath60 and @xmath46 , at lep2 energy it can be either positive or negative , depending on the actual values of the @xmath1 couplings .",
    "the deviation of @xmath2 from the sm prediction has the expression @xmath85 eq .  ( [ deltasig+ ] ) shows that the dependence of @xmath86 on the @xmath1 parameters is characterized by the expression @xmath87 , which is a negative quantity at @xmath88 for arbitrary @xmath1 couplings .",
    "in addition to the definite negative sign , @xmath86 has the property of depending on the total center of mass energy @xmath89 _ via _ the factor @xmath90 , which is completely determined by well - known sm parameters .",

    "as regards @xmath98 , it has in common with @xmath2 the property that the deviation from the sm prediction @xmath99 has an energy dependence completely determined in terms of sm parameters .",
    "however , in contrast to @xmath96 , the sign and magnitude of @xmath100 is determined by @xmath101 , for which both the positive and the negative signs are generally possible .",

    "2 we show the results from @xmath105 , and compare the bounds on the couplings ( [ coupl ] ) obtainable from current and future experiments at lep2 , with inputs from table  2 .",
    "the contours are derived from the combination of both observables , @xmath106 and @xmath3 , and correspond to two standard deviations ( @xmath107 ) . from the numerical point of view , a comparison of allowed bounds on ( @xmath108 ) depicted in fig .",
    "2 with those obtained from a similar analysis of @xmath60 and @xmath45 indicates that the new observables @xmath2 and @xmath3 have a slightly better sensitivity .",
    "this reflects the fact that , according to ( [ deltasig+ ] ) , ( [ dsigm ] ) and ( [ coupl ] ) , the deviations @xmath96 and @xmath109 are proportional to combinations of @xmath1 coupling constants ( @xmath110 , respectively ) rather than the individual ones , so that a one - parameter fit applies in this case , rather than a two - parameter one .",
    "moreover , we may remark that the above analysis is a model - independent one , as it starts from rather general considerations .",
    "therefore , it can usefully complement the conventional analysis of @xmath1 couplings based on the observables @xmath60 and @xmath45 .",
