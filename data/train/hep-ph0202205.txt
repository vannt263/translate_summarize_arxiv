    "one of the primary quests of present and future colliders is the search for the higgs boson .",
    "precision electroweak data indicate that the mass of the higgs boson lies in the range 114 gev @xmath6 200 gev @xcite .",
    "such a higgs boson may be discovered in run ii of the fermilab tevatron @xcite , and it can not escape the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite .    once a higgs boson is discovered , it will be important to measure its couplings to other particles to establish whether these couplings are those of a standard - model higgs boson , or those of a higgs boson from an extended higgs sector , such as a two - higgs - doublet model .",
    "for example , the minimal supersymmetric standard model requires the presence of two higgs doublets to cancel gauge anomalies and to generate masses for both up- and down - type quarks @xcite .",
    "there are many other models that employ an extended higgs sector as well .",
    "the coupling of the higgs boson to other particles will be measured by studying the various production processes and decay modes of the higgs boson @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the feasibility of measuring the yukawa coupling of the higgs boson to the top quark via the associated production of the higgs boson with a top - quark pair ( @xmath0 ) @xcite , followed by the decay @xmath1 @xcite , , one or both of the @xmath7 bosons is virtual . ] as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ggtth ] .",
    "this decay mode has a branching ratio in excess of @xmath8 for @xmath9 gev , and is the dominant decay mode of the higgs boson for @xmath10 gev @xcite .",
    "we study this process at the lhc ( @xmath11 tev ) with both low - luminosity and high - luminosity running .",
    "we also consider a @xmath12 100 tev very large hadron collider ( vlhc ) in order to judge the merits of increased energy .",
    "we omit a study at the tevatron since , even with 30 fb@xmath13 of integrated luminosity , the number of signal events is less than unity once branching ratios are included .",
    "let us compare the measurement of the top - quark yukawa coupling via @xmath0 , @xmath1 with other methods for measuring this yukawa coupling .",
    "a less direct way to measure the top - quark yukawa coupling at a hadron collider is to produce the higgs boson via gluon fusion @xcite . in the standard model",
    "this process is dominated by a top - quark loop , but if there are other heavy colored particles that couple to the higgs boson ( such as squarks ) , they too contribute to the amplitude , complicating the extraction of the top - quark yukawa coupling . the process @xmath14 , @xmath1 ,",
    "will be accessible at the lhc @xcite , and perhaps also at the tevatron @xcite , for some range of higgs - boson masses .",
    "the ratio of @xmath14 , @xmath1 and @xmath0 , @xmath15 is a good probe of additional contributions to the @xmath14 amplitude beyond that of the top quark , as @xmath16 and many systematic uncertainties cancel .",
    "an @xmath17 linear collider of sufficient energy and luminosity could also measure the top - quark yukawa coupling via @xmath0 , @xmath1 .",
    "a machine of energy somewhat greater than @xmath18 would be required in order to overcome the phase space suppression near threshold .",
    "in particular , a @xmath19 gev machine would not be adequate for higgs - boson masses above 130 gev .",
    "we are not aware of any studies of this process at a linear collider .    for a higgs boson of mass @xmath20 gev ,",
    "the dominant decay mode is @xmath21 .",
    "such is the case for the lightest higgs boson of the minimal supersymmetric standard model , which has a mass less than about 130 gev @xcite .",
    "the measurement of the top - quark yukawa coupling via @xmath0 in this decay mode at the lhc has been studied elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the ratio of @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath0 , @xmath1 is a good measure of the ratio of the yukawa coupling of the @xmath24 quark and the coupling of the higgs boson to @xmath7 bosons , as @xmath25 and many systematic uncertainties cancel .    in section  [ sec : signal ]",
    "we discuss the signal for @xmath0 , @xmath15 , as well as the backgrounds .",
    "we consider final states with two , three , and four leptons . in section  [ sec : calc ] we discuss the details of the calculations . in section  [ sec : results ] we present the numerical results for the number of signal and background events and discuss uncertainties .",
    "we draw conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we assume that the higgs boson has been discovered and its branching ratio into @xmath26 is known ( or is assumed to have the standard - model value ) .",
    "the extraction of the top - quark yukawa coupling then requires a measurement of the cross section for @xmath0 , @xmath1 .",
    "the total cross section is given in table  [ tab : totalcs ] for a variety of higgs - boson masses .",
    ".total cross section ( fb ) for @xmath0 , @xmath1 at the lhc and a vlhc of @xmath27 tev . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : backgroundsvlhc ]    there are three sources of uncertainty in the extraction of the top - quark yukawa coupling from the measured cross section : statistical , systematic , and theoretical .",
    "the statistical uncertainty in the measured cross section is @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the number of signal and background events , respectively .",
    "since the cross section is proportional to the square of the yukawa coupling , the statistical uncertainty in the measurement of the yukawa coupling is half that of the cross section .",
    "we show in figs .",
    "[ fig : precisionlow ] and [ fig : precisionhigh ] the statistical uncertainty @xmath31 at the low- and high - luminosity lhc , respectively . the statistical uncertainty from the two- and three - lepton final states",
    "are given separately , as well as the statistical uncertainty from the sum of the two channels , combined in quadrature .",
    "the statistical uncertainty in the four - lepton final state is much greater , due to the dearth of signal events .",
    "combining the low- and high - luminosity runs at the lhc in quadrature yields a statistical uncertainty in the measurement of the yukawa coupling of @xmath32 for @xmath3 gev , respectively .",
    "the systematic uncertainty arises from our ability to measure and calculate the backgrounds .",
    "since the signal is not separated from the backgrounds by kinematics , an accurate knowledge of the backgrounds is essential .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this work to attempt to estimate the systematic uncertainty in the measurement of the backgrounds ; an uncertainty of @xmath33 or less is desired in order to match the statistical uncertainty .",
    "the dominant background in the three- and four - lepton final states is @xmath34 .",
    "this background could be estimated by measuring @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and extrapolating away from the @xmath37 resonance .",
    "this background is absent altogether if all opposite - sign leptons are of different flavor ( e.g. , @xmath38 or @xmath39 ) , but the number of events of this type is sufficiently small that the statistical uncertainty in the cross section increases when one considers only these events .",
    "the dominant background in the two - lepton final state is @xmath40 .",
    "it is likely that our calculation overestimates this background , because , using the cuts of table  [ tab : detectorcuts ] , each of the two jets can lie near the soft and collinear regions of phase space where perturbation theory overshoots the true cross section @xcite .",
    "this background could be estimated by measuring the cross section for @xmath41 invariant masses far from the higgs mass , and then extrapolating .",
    "this is nontrivial , as it assumes that one can correctly identify the @xmath41 system with good efficiency .",
    "the theoretical uncertainty stems from the uncertainty in the subprocess cross section @xmath42 and the uncertainty in the parton distribution functions .",
    "the subprocess cross section has been calculated at next - to - leading order in the strong interaction @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the cross section on the common factorization and renormalization scales is relatively mild at the lhc , varying by about @xmath8 as the scale is varied from half to twice its central value of @xmath43 .",
    "the largest uncertainty in the parton distribution functions is from the gluons .",
    "the gluon - gluon luminosity is known to about @xmath8 accuracy at the lhc @xcite , and will be measured via @xmath44 .",
    "hence the total theoretical uncertainty in the cross section is about @xmath45 .",
    "this is adequate in comparison with the statistical uncertainty .",
    "the statistical uncertainty in @xmath31 at the vlhc from the sum of the two- and three - lepton final states is @xmath46 for @xmath47 gev .",
    "this is negligible compared with the likely systematic uncertainty .",
    "thus the measurement of the top - quark yukawa coupling at the vlhc would be limited almost entirely by the systematic uncertainty .",
    "the background @xmath48 is negligible at the lhc , but it is significant at the vlhc ; it is the largest background in the two - lepton final state , and one of the two largest backgrounds in the three - lepton final state .",
    "this background has two additional jets in the final state compared with the signal , so it could be reduced by vetoing events with extra jets . for example , vetoing events with two extra jets ( but not one ) reduces the @xmath48 background at the vlhc to 500 , 170 , 21 in the two- , three , and four - lepton final states , respectively .",
    "while this does not decrease the statistical uncertainty ( which is negligible in any case ) , it may be relevant to control the systematic uncertainty .",
    "the process @xmath0 , @xmath49 may also be accessible at the vlhc .",
    "if both @xmath37 bosons decay leptonically , the higgs - boson mass could be reconstructed , which would reduce the backgrounds .",
    "we have studied the measurement of the top - quark yukawa coupling to the higgs boson via @xmath0 , @xmath1 at the lhc .",
    "a signal is available in the two- and three - lepton final states , and the signal to background ratio is of order unity . combining both channels , and assuming 30 fb@xmath13 of integrated luminosity at low luminosity and 300 fb@xmath13 at high luminosity",
    ", we find a statistical uncertainty in the measurement of the yukawa coupling @xmath50 of @xmath2 for @xmath3 gev , respectively .",
    "the statistical uncertainty in the yukawa coupling would be negligible at a 100 tev vlhc .",
    "thus the uncertainty in the yukawa coupling would be dominated by the systematic uncertainty .",
