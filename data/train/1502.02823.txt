    "gamma ray data from the fermi - lat reveal two giant bubbles extending up to @xmath0 above and below the galactic disk , called the fermi bubbles(fbs)@xcite@xcite .",
    "the spectra of the fbs are harder than ambient radiation fields , and they have sharp edge , which means sudden change of the brightness at the boundary . the surface brightness is almost constant in the fbs , though it does nt mean the fbs have constant volume emissivities .",
    "there also exists the microwave bubbles in the same region , dubbed the wmap haze@xcite .",
    "these huge structures may suggest past large - scaled activities in the galactic center(gc ) , near the massive black hole sgr @xmath1 .",
    "two representative models have been argued in order to explain both the fbs and the wmap haze .",
    "hadronic model reproduces the fbs by the gamma ray from the @xmath2-decay process , and the wmap haze by the radiation from the secondary electrons@xcite@xcite . in the hadronic model , protons are accelerated by the diffusive shock acceleration(dsa ) or other process , and they make @xmath2 after collision with cosmic - ray protons .",
    "@xmath3 are also made in this process , and they decay to @xmath4 .",
    "these secondary particles radiate microwave in the magnetic field by the synchrotron radiation .",
    "in contrast , leptonic model explains the fbs by the gamma ray from the inverse compton scattering(ic ) process , and the wmap haze by the synchrotron radiation from the relativistic electrons@xcite@xcite . in the leptonic model",
    ", it is assumed that electrons are accelerated by the second order fermi acceleration(stochastic acceleration ) by plasma turbulence or molecular clouds , in order to explain hard spectra of the fbs .",
    "these relativistic electrons give their energy to the ambient photons by the ic process , and they are observed as gamma ray .",
    "some electrons radiate microwaves by the synchrotron radiation , and the wmap haze are made .",
    "however , both hadronic and leptonic model have problems .",
    "hadronic models require so much energy @xmath5 erg , and estimated microwave spectrum conflicts with the wmap data@xcite . in the leptonic models ,",
    "it is difficult to explain the wmap haze under typical galactic magnetic field(@xmath6 g ) , so it is required strong magnetic field in the large scale@xcite .",
    "so we construct the extended model based on the stochastic acceleration model by mertsch & sarkar@xcite .",
    "their model assumes that electrons are accelerated by the turbulence whose acceleration efficiency decreases with the distance from the shock front .",
    "but they do nt consider the time development of the electron spectrum , and presume that electrons are at steady states .",
    "they also neglect the contribution of the electrons escape from the turbulence .",
    "so we extend their model by considering both time development and electrons out of the turbulence . in the sec.[sec : models ] , we explain our acceleration model . and in the sec.[sec :",
    "result ] , we show the results of our numerical calculation .",
    "we assume thet there is the shock front near the edge of the fbs and the plasma turbulences are drifted from the shock front with time by the advection at @xmath7 .    in order to calculate the electron spectrum , we solve the fokker - planck equation , @xmath8    where the momentum diffusion coefficient @xmath9 in the second term is described@xcite    @xmath10    which represents the farther from the shock ,",
    "the weaker the acceleration efficiency becomes .    in ( [ dpp_xi ] )",
    "@xmath11 is energy , @xmath12 is wavenumber , @xmath13 is the velocity of the fast - mode wave , and @xmath14 is the energy density of the kolmogorov turbulence .",
    "@xmath15 is the spatial diffusion coefficient .",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath16(@xmath17 is the distance from the shock front , and @xmath18 is the turbulence size ) represents how far from the shock front .",
    "the third term describes the diffusive loss from the turbulence , and then @xmath19 is accounted for @xmath20 .",
    "the forth term of ( [ dpp_xi ] ) corresponds to the energy loss of the synchrotron radiation and the ic scatering ,    @xmath21    @xmath22    @xmath23 where @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is shown in figure  [ bgph ] .",
    "@xmath26 is the factor due to the klein ",
    "nishina effect , which is numerically evaluated . in our models",
    ", @xmath27 is fixed @xmath28 , which corresponds to sound speed at @xmath29 kev .",
    "we presume that injection rate is constant , @xmath30 where the spectrum shape of injected electron is assumed to be @xmath31-function , @xmath32 . in this paper",
    ", we use @xmath33 ev .",
    "we consider the effect of time development , so we assume that the distance from the shock front changes with time like @xmath34 , and then @xmath9 becomes the function of the time @xmath35 .",
    "we also consider the contribution of the electrons out of the turbulence , so we solve the equation of these electrons @xmath36 where @xmath37 is equal to the escape rate from the turbulence @xmath38 .    to verify the effect of the escape",
    ", we calculate the spectrum of electrons under three cases .",
    "no escape model is the model in which we neglect the escape term @xmath39(the limit @xmath40 ) . in the cut escape model",
    ", we consider the effect of escape but we do nt deal with electron out of the turbulence(like@xcite ) .",
    "so in the cut escape model , we solve only ( [ fpeq ] ) , and do nt solve ( [ fpesc ] ) .",
    "we consider the electrons out of the turbulence in the with escape model , then we solve both ( [ fpeq ] ) and ( [ fpesc ] ) , and finally calculate sum of them @xmath41 .    after the calculation of the spectrum of the electrons , we estimate the intensity from those electrons and compare with the data of the fermi - lat and the wmap . in the next section sec.[sec : result ] , we show the results of our calculation .",
    "our results are shown in the figure  [ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "we calculate equation ( [ fpeq ] ) under the three cases at variable parameters @xmath18 and @xmath42 for @xmath43 myr . @xmath44 and",
    "@xmath45 g are fixed .",
    "the result of no escape model is shown in blue solid line , cut escape model is shown in red solid line , and with escape model is shown in black solid line .",
    "the data points in @xcite are adopted .",
    "gamma ray data of the fermi - lat are nicely reproduced in all cases .",
    "but the microwave data of the wmap are reproduced only by with escape model(figure  [ fig : spectrum ] ) .",
    "this is because of increasing of low energy particles due to escape from the turbulence . in this case",
    "the turbulence size @xmath46 pc , smaller than that of in @xcite @xmath47 kpc .",
    "if we reproduce the wmap data in other cases , stronger magnetic field is required at large scale .",
    "we reproduce both the fermi bubble and the wmap haze under typical galactic magnetic field @xmath45 g by considering the effect of time dependence and electrons which escape from the turbulence .",
    "cut escape model which is similar to the model of previous research mertsch & sarkar @xcite reproduce gamma ray data well , but predicted microwave emission is not enough at @xmath45 g .",
    "our results suggest that smaller turbulence size is better for reproducing microwave observation , because of more easily escaping from the turbulence .      99 su , m. , slatyer , t. r. , & finkbeiner , d. p. 2010 , apj , 724 , 1044 ackermann , m. , et al .",
