    "improved measurements of the link between galaxies and the dark matter distribution will benefit a variety of cosmological applications but will also provide important clues about the role that dark matter plays in galaxy formation process .",
    "although multiple techniques have been developed for this purpose , no single method has yet emerged as the ultimate tool and all suffer from various drawbacks .",
    "the goal of this paper is to develop the theoretical foundations required to combine multiple probes into a single tool that will provide more powerful constraints on the galaxy - dark matter connection .",
    "this paper extends and complements a growing body of work on this topic @xcite .    at present",
    ", there are only two observational techniques capable of _ directly _ probing the dark matter halos of galaxies out to large radii ( above 50 kpc ) : galaxy - galaxy lensing ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the kinematics of satellite galaxies @xcite . galaxy - galaxy lensing ( hereafter `` g - g lensing '' ) utilizes subtle distortions induced in the shapes and orientations of distant background galaxies in order to measure foreground mass distributions .",
    "the satellite kinematic method uses satellite galaxies as test particles to trace out the dark matter velocity field .",
    "neither method can probe the halos of individual galaxies . instead , both techniques must stack an ensemble of foreground galaxies in order to extract a signal . nonetheless , with the advent of data - sets large enough to provide statistically significant samples , improvements in photometric redshift techniques , and spectroscopic follow - up programs ,",
    "both methods have emerged as powerful probes of the galaxy - dark matter connection and have truly evolved into mature techniques over the last decade .",
    "in addition to these two direct probes , there are also several popular indirect methods to infer the galaxy - dark matter connection from the statistics of galaxy clustering . for example , numerous authors have employed a statistical model to describe the probability distribution @xmath3 that a halo of mass @xmath4 is host to n galaxies above some threshold in luminosity or stellar - mass .",
    "this statistical model , commonly known as the halo occupation distribution ( hod ) , has been considerably successful at interpreting the clustering properties of galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the hod provides a description of the spatial distribution of galaxies at all scales , but it is usually inferred observationally by modeling measurements of the two - point correlation function of galaxies , @xmath5 . since they were introduced a decade ago , hod models have progressively increased in fidelity and complexity owing to stronger observational constraints but also to the availability of larger , high - resolution cosmological n - body simulations of the dark matter .",
    "for example , analytical descriptions of the form and evolution of the halo mass function and the large - scale halo bias , both of which are key ingredients for hod models , are approaching percent - level precision ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a variety of extensions to the basic hod framework have also been proposed .",
    "for example , the conditional luminosity function @xmath6 specifies the average number of galaxies of luminosity @xmath7 that reside in a halo of mass @xmath8 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the conditional stellar mass function @xmath9 describes the average number of galaxies with stellar masses in the range @xmath10 as a function of host halo mass @xmath4 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , a number of studies are also starting to take into account , not only the simple expectation values of the underlying relations , but also the scatter between the observable and halo - mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a crucial ingredient for a complete description of the galaxy - dark matter connection .    finally , halo mass constraints from the galaxy stellar mass function ( hereafter `` smf '' ) have also been derived by assuming that there is there is a monotonic correspondence between halo mass ( or circular velocity ) and galaxy stellar mass ( or luminosity ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this particular technique , often referred to as `` abundance matching '' , is economic in terms of data requirements since it only considers the observed stellar mass ( or luminosity ) function .",
    "however , prior knowledge about the mass distribution of halos ( and substructure within those halos ) from cosmological n - body simulations is necessary as well as the assumption that field halos and subhalos of the same halo mass contain galaxies of the same stellar mass .    while considerable effort has been invested in exploring each of these probes individually , attempts to _ combine _ them in a fully consistent way are still in their infancy",
    "nevertheless , savvy combinations hold great potential to not only elucidate the evolution of the galaxy - dark matter connection , and consequently the galaxy formation physics responsible for it , but to also constrain fundamental physics , including the cosmological model and the nature of gravity . for example",
    ", measurements of small - scale galaxy clustering alone do not yield cosmological constraints unless coupled with probes that are sensitive to the mass scales of dark matter halos ( e.g. , cluster mass - to - light ratios , satellite kinematics , g - g lensing , etc . )",
    "in particular , @xcite and @xcite have shown that the combination of g - g lensing and galaxy clustering is sensitive to @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "conceptually , this sensitivity arises from the fact that this particular combination simultaneously probes the shape and amplitude of the halo mass function at small scales and the overall matter density and the bias of the galaxy sample at large scales .",
    "other combinations can be sensitive to parameters in modified gravity theories .",
    "a generic metric theory of gravity has two scalar potentials , @xmath13 , which affects the clustering and dynamics of galaxies , and @xmath14 , which affects the lensing of light around galaxies .",
    "combining probes of g - g lensing with clustering and/or satellite dynamics allows a test of the general relativity ( gr ) prediction that @xmath15 as well as the poisson equations which relate these potentials to the underlying density distribution . for example , @xcite have used a combination of g - g lensing , galaxy clustering , and redshift space distortions to place limits on possible modifications to gr on @xmath1610 mpc scales .",
    "tests of gravity on smaller scales , though complicated by the fact that structures have undergone non - linear evolution , are interesting in several respects .",
    "first , _ all of our direct probes _ of the dark matter are either intrinsically limited to small scales ( e.g. , a few mpc for satellite kinematics ) or have significantly larger signals on small scales ( e.g. , below 10 mpc for both cosmic shear and g - g lensing ) .",
    "second , there are many alternative gravity theories which predict unique and interesting modifications on these scales @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we develop the theoretical framework necessary to constrain the galaxy - dark matter connection by combining measurements of galaxy clustering , g - g lensing , and the galaxy smf . the formalism outlined in this paper",
    "could also be applied to model satellite kinematics ( see @xcite ) . for this work ,",
    "we adopt the standard hod framework but with several key modifications . for instance",
    ", a procedure often adopted in clustering studies is to fit a set of hod parameters ( typically three to five ) independently to the clustering signal and number density for each galaxy sample .",
    "however , adopting this strategy would require selecting a common binning scheme for all probes .",
    "in practice , we would like to avoid using a single binning scheme because various probes have different signal - to - noise ( s / n ) requirements .",
    "we therefore modify the standard hod model so that we can simultaneously fit data from multiple probes while allowing for independent binning schemes for each probe .",
    "also , since we are interested in the galaxy - dark matter connection , we modify the hod model so as to specifically include a parameterization for the stellar - to - halo mass relation ( hereafter `` shmr '' ) . in leauthaud",
    "2011b ( hereafter paper ii ) , we demonstrate that this model provides an excellent fit to g - g lensing , galaxy clustering , and stellar mass function measurements in the cosmos survey from @xmath17 to @xmath18 .    for 2 deg@xmath19 surveys such as cosmos ,",
    "the finite sample size of the observational data set is also an important concern .",
    "we will present an estimate of the sample variance using mock surveys from numerical simulations . we will also estimate the covariance of the data for each observational measure .",
    "we will demonstrate that this is especially important for modeling the smf , an effect that is usually not incorporated into most analyses .",
    "the finite sample size in cosmos biases clustering measurements through the integral constraint , an effect we will also model through our mock surveys .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows . to begin with ,",
    "we introduce the parametric form used to model the shmr in @xmath20[the_shmr ] .",
    "next , in @xmath20[hodtheory ] , we present the general hod framework and our extensions to this model . in @xmath20[application_of_model ] , we show how this model can be used to simultaneously fit g - g lensing , galaxy clustering , and smf measurements . in @xmath20[parameter_influance ] , we describe the influence of each model parameter on the three observables .",
    "we then construct a set of mocks catalogs designed to mimic the cosmos survey and describe the behaviour of the covariance matrices for the three probes in @xmath20[mocks ] . finally , we draw up our conclusions in @xmath20[conclusions ] .",
    "we assume a wmap5 @xmath21cdm cosmology with @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 km  s@xmath28  mpc@xmath28 @xcite .",
    "unless stated otherwise , all distances are expressed in physical mpc .",
    "the letter @xmath4 denotes halo mass .",
    "the halo radius is noted @xmath29 . in this paper ,",
    "halo mass is defined as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the radius at which the mean interior density is equal to 200 times the mean matter density ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "we note however that our theoretical framework is valid for any reasonable choice of halo definition .",
    "stellar mass is noted @xmath33 .",
    "to begin with , we present the mathematical function that we use to model the shmr and we describe the influence of each of the five parameters that regulate its shape .",
    "we will assume that the shmr is specifically valid for `` central '' galaxies which are located by definition at the center of their parent halos .",
    "dark matter halos also contain smaller bound density peaks that orbit around the center of the potential well .",
    "these substructures are commonly referred to as sub - halos ; these sub - halos are the likely sites of `` satellite '' galaxies that have been accreted onto their parent halos .",
    "the abundance matching technique commonly assumes that satellite galaxies follow the same shmr as centrals provided that halo mass is defined at the epoch when satellites were accreted onto their parent halos ( m@xmath34 ) , rather than the current sub - halo mass @xcite .",
    "however , this pre - supposes that satellite stellar growth occurs at a similar rate as centrals of equivalent halo mass ( that is to say with a halo mass equal to m@xmath34 ) .",
    "since one might expect that satellites and centrals experience distinct stellar growth rates , we model central and satellite galaxies separately in order to keep our model as general as possible .    in @xmath20 [ ncen_model ]",
    ", we will show how the shmr can be used to predict the central occupation function and then we will introduce the model for satellite galaxies in @xmath20 [ model_nsat ] .      let us consider the conditional stellar mass function ( the analog of the conditional luminosity function ) which represents the number of galaxies with @xmath35 in the range @xmath36 at fixed halo mass and is noted @xmath37 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the conditional stellar mass function can be divided into a central component and a satellite component : @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath39 is the conditional stellar mass function for central galaxies , and it will be our mathematical representation of the shmr . note that in our model , the halo mass in the term @xmath40 refers to the host halo mass .",
    "in addition to the shape and evolution of the mean shmr , astrophysical processes are expected to induce an intrinsic scatter in stellar mass at fixed halo mass which it is important to take into consideration when defining a functional form for @xmath39 .",
    "another non negligible source of scatter can be the measurement error associated with the determination of stellar masses . in the absence of strong observational or theoretical guidance for the form and magnitude of the total scatter ( intrinsic plus measurement ) ,",
    "we adopt a stochastic model where @xmath39 is a log - normal probability distribution function ( hereafter `` pdf '' ) with a log - normal scatter noted @xmath41 .",
    "since we have assumed a log - normal functional form , @xmath39 can be written as :    @xmath42    @xmath43 ^ 2}{2\\sigma_{\\rm log      m_{*}}^2}\\right]\\ ] ]    where @xmath44 represents the logarithmic mean of the stellar mass given the halo mass for the @xmath45 distribution function .",
    "equation [ lognormal_equation ] is normalized such that the integral of @xmath39 over @xmath35 is equal to 1 .    to model",
    "@xmath45 we must specify a functional form for both @xmath44 and for @xmath41 .",
    "there is increasing evidence to suggest that low and high mass galaxies have different stellar - to - halo mass ratios , probably as a result of multiple feedback mechanisms that operate at distinct mass scales and regulate star formation .",
    "we therefore require a shmr that is flexible enough to capture such variations .",
    "we adopt the functional form presented in @xcite ( hereafter `` b10 '' ) which has been shown to reproduce the local sdss stellar mass function using the abundance matching technique . in practice",
    ", @xmath46 is mathematically defined following via its inverse function :    @xmath47    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is a characteristic halo mass , @xmath50 is a characteristic stellar mass , @xmath51 is the low mass end slope , @xmath52 controls the transition region , and @xmath53 controls the massive end slope .",
    "details regarding the justification of this functional form can be found in @xmath20 3.4.3 of b10 .",
    "note that a variety of similar functional forms have been proposed by previous authors .",
    "for example , the interested reader can look at equation 2 in @xcite and equation 20 in @xcite .",
    "in contrast to b10 , we do not parametrize the redshift evolution of this functional form . instead , in paper ii",
    ", we bin the data into three redshift bins and check for redshift evolution in the parameters a posteriori .",
    "another difference with respect to b10 is that we assume that equation [ shmr ] is only relevant for central galaxies whereas b10 assume that the shmr also applies to satellite galaxies , provided that the halo mass of a satellite galaxy is defined as m@xmath34 .",
    "it is important to note that our shmr traces the location of the mean - log stellar mass : @xmath54 .",
    "other authors may report the mean stellar mass , @xmath55 , or even the mean halo mass at fixed stellar mass , @xmath56 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these averaging systems will yield different results in the presence of scatter .",
    "for example , @xmath57 will be biased low compared to @xmath58 if @xmath59 is non zero .",
    "this bias will increase with @xmath59 and for larger values of the high - mass slope of @xmath60 .    in figure [ mh_ms_vary_p ]",
    "we illustrate the impact of the five parameters that determine @xmath44 on the shape on the shmr .",
    "a brief description is as follows :    * * @xmath49 * controls the characteristic halo mass ; increasing @xmath61 will result in larger halos hosting galaxies at a given stellar mass . in figure [ mh_ms_vary_p ] ( which represents @xmath35 on the x - axis and @xmath4 on the y - axis ) : @xmath61 controls the y - axis amplitude ( halo mass ) of @xmath60 so that a constant change in @xmath49 leads to a constant up / down logarithmic shift in @xmath60 .",
    "note that this constant logarithmic shift may not be visually obvious because the slope of the shmr increases sharply at @xmath62 m@xmath1 .",
    "* @xmath50 controls the characteristic stellar mass ; increasing @xmath50 will result in smaller halos hosting galaxies at a given stellar mass . in figure [ mh_ms_vary_p ] , @xmath50 controls the x - axis amplitude of @xmath60 .",
    "* @xmath51 controls the low mass power - law slope of @xmath60 .",
    "when @xmath51 increases , the low mass end slope becomes steeper .",
    "* the @xmath53 parameter regulates how rapidly @xmath60 climbs at high @xmath35 .",
    "indeed , @xmath60 asymptotes to a sub - exponential function at high @xmath35 which signifies that @xmath60 climbs more rapidly than a power - law function but less rapidly than an exponential function ( see discussion in b10 ) . *",
    "@xmath52 controls the transition regime between the low - mass power - law regime and the high - mass sub - exponential behaviour .",
    "a larger value of @xmath52 corresponds to a more sharp transition between the two regimes .",
    "a quantity that is of particular interest is the mass ( we refer here to both @xmath35 and @xmath4 ) at which the ratio @xmath63 reaches a minimum .",
    "this minimum is of noteworthy importance for galaxy formation models because it marks the mass at which the accumulated stellar growth of the central galaxy has been the most efficient . in this paper , and in subsequent papers , we will refer to the stellar mass , halo mass , and ratio at which this minimum occurs as the `` pivot stellar mass '' , @xmath64 , the `` pivot halo mass '' , @xmath65 , and the `` pivot ratio '' , @xmath66 . note that @xmath64 and @xmath65 are not simply equal to @xmath49 and to @xmath50 . indeed , the mathematical formulation of the shmr is such that the pivot masses depend on all five parameters .",
    "the three parameters that have the strongest effect on the pivot masses are @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath52 . for example , as can be seen in the right hand panel of figure [ mh_ms_vary_p ] , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are inversely proportional to @xmath52 . to lesser extent , the two remaining parameters , @xmath51 and @xmath53 also have a small influence on the pivot masses .",
    "we now turn our attention to the second component of @xmath39 which is the scatter in stellar mass at fixed halo mass , @xmath41 .",
    "the total measured scatter will have two components : an intrinsic component ( noted @xmath67 ) and a measurement error component due to redshift , photometry , and modeling uncertainties in stellar mass measurements ( noted @xmath68 ) .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the intrinsic scatter component is independent of the measurement error component .",
    "assuming gaussian error distributions , we can write that :    @xmath69    while the error distribution for the stellar mass estimate for any single galaxy may be non gaussian , in this work we are only concerned with stacked ensembles .",
    "b10 have tested that the error distribution for a stacked ensemble is gaussian to good approximation and that small non - gaussian wings in this distribution are not likely to affect this type of analysis .    in practice ,",
    "since the data are always binned according to @xmath35 , the observables are actually sensitive to the scatter in halo mass at fixed stellar mass which we note @xmath70",
    ". it will therefore be useful to understand the link between @xmath71 and @xmath41 .",
    "if the shmr is a power law , the relationship between @xmath70 and @xmath72 is simply :    @xmath73    for example , if there is a power law relation between halo mass and stellar mass such that @xmath74 then @xmath75 . in our case",
    ", the shmr behaves like a power - law at low @xmath35 . at high @xmath35",
    ", however , @xmath76 increases as a function of @xmath35",
    ". therefore if @xmath41 is constant , @xmath77 will be equal to @xmath78 at low @xmath35 but then will continuously increase with @xmath35 at a rate set by @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "if we adopt the best fit model to the shmr from paper ii in the redshift range @xmath79 , we find that the power - law index of the shmr increases steeply at @xmath80 so that @xmath71 becomes quite large .",
    "for example , @xmath81 dex at @xmath82 and @xmath83 dex at @xmath84 . in practical terms",
    ", this implies that the most massive galaxies do not necessarily live in the most massive halos .",
    "for example , a galaxy with @xmath85 m@xmath1 could be the central galaxy of of group with @xmath86 , or could also be the central galaxy of a cluster with @xmath87 .",
    "the increase of @xmath70 with @xmath35 will lead to a noticeable effect in the g - g lensing , clustering , and stellar mass functions at large @xmath35 that is analogous to eddington bias .",
    "this effect will be discussed in further detail in @xmath20 [ parameter_influance ] .",
    "in this section , we show how @xmath39 can be used to determine the central halo occupation function and we introduce five new parameters to describe the satellite occupation function .      in this paper , we assume that stellar mass is used to implement the hod model since it is expected to be a more faithful tracer of halo mass than galaxy luminosity .    consider a galaxy sample such that @xmath88 ( a `` threshold '' sample ) .",
    "the _ central occupation function _",
    ", noted @xmath89 , is the average number of central galaxies in this sample that are hosted by a halo of mass @xmath4 .",
    "the _ satellite occupation function _",
    ", noted @xmath90 , is the equivalent function for satellite galaxies .    in",
    "what follows , we focus on the appropriate equations for threshold samples . in paper ii however , we will use `` binned '' samples ( @xmath91 ) to calculate the g - g lensing and the smf .",
    "we therefore note that the occupation functions for binned samples are trivially derived from the occupation function for threshold samples via :    @xmath92    and    @xmath93      for a threshold sample of galaxies , @xmath89 is fully specified given @xmath39 according to :    @xmath95    because the integral of @xmath39 over @xmath35 is equal to 1 , @xmath96 will vary between 0 and 1 .    to begin with , let us make the simplifying assumption that @xmath41 is constant .",
    "because @xmath45 is parametrized as a log - normal distribution , the central occupation function can be analytically derived from equation [ ncen_and_phic ] by considering the cumulative distribution function of the gaussian :    @xmath97    @xmath98,\\ ] ]    where erf is the error function defined as :    @xmath99    it is important to note that equation [ ncen ] is only valid when @xmath41 is constant . in the more general case where @xmath41 varies ,",
    "@xmath94 can nonetheless be calculated by numerically integrating equation [ ncen_and_phic ] . in paper ii we will consider cases in which @xmath41 varies due to the effects of stellar mass dependant measurement errors . in this case",
    ", we will numerically integrate equation [ ncen_and_phic ] to calculate @xmath94 ( see @xmath20 4.2 in paper ii ) .",
    "we note that most readers may be more familiar with a simplified version of equation [ ncen ] that assumes that @xmath46 is a power law .",
    "we will now describe the assumptions made in order to obtain the more commonly employed equation for @xmath94 from equation [ ncen ] .    if we make the assumption that @xmath100 and we define @xmath101 such that @xmath102 ( in other terms , @xmath101 is the inverse of the shmr relation for the stellar mass threshold @xmath103 ) then using equation [ ncen ] we can write that :    @xmath97    @xmath104.\\ ] ]    if we now use the fact that @xmath105 and if we _ define _",

    "firstly , it is important to note that equation [ ncen2 ] is only an approximation for @xmath94 for the case when the shmr is a power - law and is certainly not valid over a large range of stellar masses .",
    "secondly , @xmath106 can be interpreted as the scatter in halo mass at fixed stellar mass if and only if the shmr is a power - law and if @xmath41 is constant .",
    "since there is accumulating evidence that the shmr is not a single power law ( and the same is in general true for the relationship between halo mass and galaxy luminosity ) , we recommend using equation [ ncen ] instead of equation [ ncen2 ] .",
    "figures [ study_mmin ] and [ study_mmin2 ] illustrate the difference in @xmath94 when equation [ ncen ] is used to describe clustering instead of equation [ ncen2 ] . to make this figure ,",
    "we have assumed the parameter set : @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath41=0.25 . for each stellar mass threshold in figure [ study_mmin ]",
    ", we determine the values of @xmath115 and @xmath106 in equation [ ncen2 ] such that the number density of central galaxies and the bias of those galaxies is the same as that achieved with equation [ ncen ] .",
    "thus our procedure mimics what one would obtain through analysis of the clustering and space density of such samples , assuming that the satellite occupation would be the same in either analysis .",
    "figure [ study_mmin ] reveals that because the shmr has a sub - exponential behaviour at @xmath116 , @xmath94 begins to deviate from a simple erf function for high stellar mass samples and therefore is not well described by equation [ ncen2 ] .",
    "assuming that equation [ ncen ] correctly represents @xmath94 , the error made on @xmath101 can be of order 10% to 40% at @xmath117 @xmath118 if equation [ ncen2 ] is used to describe @xmath94 instead of equation [ ncen ] .",
    "we note that this does not invalidate equation [ ncen2 ] as a possible parameterization of the central occupation function .",
    "however , interpreting @xmath101 in equation [ ncen2 ] as @xmath119 can result in a 10 - 40% error in the true mean halo mass ( with larger errors for @xmath120 ) .",
    "also , the `` scatter '' ( @xmath106 ) constrained by this parametrization is not equal to the scatter in a log - normal distribution of stellar mass at fixed halo mass . finally , one troublesome aspect of using the erf functional form in equation [ ncen2 ] is that @xmath94 curves for different stellar mass thresholds may actually cross at low halo mass , implying the unphysical condition that halos of mass @xmath4 have a `` negative '' amount of galaxies between two threshold values .",
    "this is seen at @xmath121 m@xmath1 in figure [ study_mmin ] . for values of @xmath41 larger than what we have assumed here",
    ", this effect will occur at even higher halo mass . using equation",
    "[ ncen ] with a model for the shmr prevents this from occurring , and @xmath94 for various galaxy samples can be calculated self - consistently .",
    "in addition to the five parameters introduced to model @xmath94 and @xmath41 , we introduce five new parameters to model @xmath122 . in order to simultaneously fit g - g lensing , clustering , and stellar mass function measurements that employ different binning schemes , we require a model for @xmath122 that is independent of any given binning scheme . for this reason , we parameterize the satellite function with threshold samples .",
    "the number of satellite galaxies in a bin of stellar mass is determined by a simple difference of two threshold samples .",
    "this also eliminates the need to integrate over stellar mass , as required when working explicitly through the conditional stellar mass function .",

    "indeed , satellite galaxies in lrg samples mainly originate in @xmath222 halos because @xmath224 is close to the exponential cut - off in the halo mass function ( for lrgs , @xmath225 m@xmath1 ) .",
    "however , for the types of samples that we consider in paper ii , deviations from poisson statistics should not significantly effect the clustering predictions of the hod .",
    "a detailed description of the two - halo term can be found in @xcite .",
    "briefly , in the regime where @xmath226 of massive halos , this term can be expressed as    @xmath227    where @xmath228 is the non - linear matter correlation function and @xmath229 is the large - scale bias of galaxies in the sample , and @xmath230 is the scale dependence of dark matter halo bias . for @xmath228 , we use the fitting function of @xcite . for @xmath230 ,",

    "is explained in detail in @xcite .",
    "because the mass function and bias relation used in this analysis are taken from numerical results based on spherical - overdensity ( so ) halo catalogs ( @xcite ) , the halo exclusion must be modified to match this halo definition . in the so halo finding algorithm of @xcite ,",
    "halos are allowed to overlap so long as the center of one halo is not contained within the radius of another halo .",
    "thus , the minimum separation of two halos with radii @xmath235 is @xmath236 , rather than the sum of the two radii , as done in @xcite . for a projected statistic like @xmath206 ,",
    "this makes only a small difference in clustering at the 1-halo 2-halo transition , but significantly speeds up computation of the 2-halo term .",
    "once we have calculated @xmath237 for a given hod model , we compute the observable @xmath206 by :    @xmath238    where @xmath239 is the normalized redshift distribution of the galaxy sample , @xmath240 is the comoving radial coordinate at redshift @xmath241 and @xmath242 .",
    "figure [ illustration_wtheta1 ] shows the breakdown of the angular correlation function into the one - halo and two - halo terms for low - mass and high - mass galaxy samples .",
    "we have shown in @xmath20 [ ds_correlation_funct ] that the lensing observable , @xmath156 , can be obtained from @xmath243 by performing two integrals ( equations [ dsigma1_bis ] and [ dsigma2 ] ) . following the approach of @xcite ,",

    "the product @xmath249 is split into two terms :    @xmath250    where @xmath251 is linked to the density profiles of dark matter halos ( see appendix ) and @xmath252 is related to the convolution of the dark matter density profile and the satellite galaxy distribution . to calculate @xmath251",
    "we assume spherical nfw profiles truncated at @xmath253 and we adopt the @xcite mass - concentration relation for a wmap5 cosmology . to calculate @xmath252",
    "we assume that the satellite galaxy distribution follows the dark matter distribution . given this assumption , @xmath252 is simply related to the convolution of the nfw profile with itself .    in this paper",
    ", we neglect the contribution to @xmath156 from sub - halos ; @xcite have shown this component to be negligible at the 10% level .",
    "we calculate the two - halo term as described in @xcite , with two major exceptions .",
    "first , as stated in the previous section , we are using the halo exclusion from the so halo definition .",
    "second , because the halo mass function of @xcite and halo bias function of @xcite are normalized such that integrating over all @xmath4 produces the mean matter density and a bias of unity , there is no need to employ the `` break mass '' from @xcite ( see their equation 16 ) . in the limit where @xmath226 of massive halos ,    @xmath254    analogous to equation [ e.2halo_approx ] .",
    "in addition to the two terms presented above , we add another component to the modeling of @xmath156 which is absent in @xcite , namely the contribution to @xmath156 from the baryons of the central galaxy which can be non negligible on very small scales ( @xmath255 50 kpc ) .",
    "although the baryons typically follow srsic profiles @xcite , at the scales of interest for this study , well above a few effective radii ( @xmath256 20 kpc ) , the lensing contribution of the baryons can be modeled by a simple point - source , scaled to @xmath257 , the average stellar mass of the galaxies in the sample :    @xmath258    in total , the final g - g lensing signal is modelled as the sum of three terms : @xmath259 .",
    "note that the one halo and two halo terms can also be decomposed into central and satellite contributions but for simplicity , we have grouped these terms together .    in order to illustrate the various terms that contribute to the g - g lensing signal",
    ", we have plotted the signal in figure [ illustration_gg_lensing ] .",
    "in the previous section we have outlined how our model can be used to analytically predict the smf , g - g lensing , and clustering signals .",
    "we will now investigate how each parameter in the model affects the three observables .",
    "for this exercise , we adopt the best fit model parameters for @xmath260 from paper ii and we vary each parameter in turn by @xmath261 around the best fit model . for this section ,",
    "we assume that @xmath41 is constant .",
    "we also assume that @xmath262 is constant and we set @xmath263 in this section since this is also the assumption that we make in paper ii . in total",
    ", we therefore study the effects of ten parameters : @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath53 , @xmath52 , @xmath41 , @xmath264 , @xmath145 , @xmath149 , and @xmath136 .",
    "the results are shown in figures [ p_variation_massive ] and [ p_variation_low ] and are described in further detail below .",
    "the influence of each model parameter on the observed smf is shown in the right hand column in figure [ p_variation_massive ] ( the same column is reproduced in figure [ p_variation_low ] ) .",
    "the data point with an error bar represents the typical error bar for a cosmos - like survey where the error bar includes sample variance computed from a series of mock catalogs ( described in the following section ) . the first point worth mentioning here",
    "is that the errors on the smf are relatively small compared to the clustering and the lensing .",
    "it is always the case that a measurement of a one - point statistic from a given set of data is more precise than a measurement of a two - point ( or higher ) statistic .",
    "the implies that the smf will in general play an important role in constraining the parameters of the shmr .",
    "however , in follow - up work we will investigate the sensitivity of this probe combination to cosmological parameters and models of modified gravity for example . in these studies , the clustering and",
    "the g - g lensing will play a critical role despite their typically larger errors bars .    a second noteworthy point in figure [ p_variation_massive ]",
    "is that the smf appears to be sensitive to all ten parameters whereas certain parameters such as @xmath50 and @xmath51 have very little effect on the clustering and lensing signals .",
    "coupled with the fact that the smf has fairly small error bars , this implies that the smf will have quite a lot of constraining power on the overall model compared to the g - g lensing for example .",
    "the effects of @xmath49 and @xmath50 on the smf are fairly intuitive . @xmath49",
    "roughly induces an up / down shift in the amplitude of the smf and @xmath50 corresponds to a left / right shift in the smf .",
    "a larger value of @xmath145 implies that there are fewer satellite galaxies in high mass halos for a given stellar mass threshold .",
    "thus we see that an increase in @xmath145 corresponds to a decrease in the amplitude of the smf due to the fact that the contribution from satellite galaxies has decreased .",
    "similar arguments apply to @xmath136 . from figure [ p_variation_massive ]",
    "we can anticipate that if the smf were only used to constrain this model , degeneracies would occur between @xmath145 , @xmath136 , and @xmath49 .",
    "fortunately , the satellite parameters have a significant effect on both the clustering and the g - g lensing so this degeneracy should be broken when all three probes are used in conjunction .    in figure [ smf_dip_feature ]",
    "we highlight the effects of four particular parameters on the smf : @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath51 parameter affects the low - mass slope of the smf so that a larger value of @xmath51 corresponds to a steeper low - mass slope in the smf .",
    "the @xmath52 parameter ( we recall that this controls the transition region of the shmr as can be seen from figure [ mh_ms_vary_p ] ) has an interesting effect since it regulates a `` plateau '' feature in the smf at @xmath265 . in fact , this feature in the smf has been noticed already and discussed in detail for example in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "this feature was described as a `` dip '' because at these scales , the smf is below the best fit schecter function . however , we note that `` dip '' is a somewhat misleading name for this feature since it could also be taken to mean that @xmath266 does not decrease monotonically with @xmath35 .",
    "a close inspection of our smfs in paper ii shows that there is no evidence in the data for an actual `` dip '' in @xmath267 . instead",
    ", the data are more consistent with a flattening of @xmath268 around @xmath269 .",
    "therefore , we would like to suggest that this feature should be described as a `` plateau '' in the smf rather than a `` dip '' .    in figure [ smf_dip_feature2 ]",
    "we show the link between the dark matter halo mass function , the shmr , and the smf . in this figure",
    ", we have used the fact that @xmath270 so that the various functions can be linked `` by eye '' by drawing a box between the four different panels .",
    "we have illustrated how to link the various functions with the dash - dash lines in figure [ smf_dip_feature2 ] at the scale of the pivot stellar mass .",
    "figure [ smf_dip_feature2 ] shows that the `` plateau '' feature is caused by the transition that occurs in the shmr at @xmath2 m@xmath1 from a low - mass power - law regime to a sub - exponential function at higher stellar mass .",
    "finally , the scatter in stellar mass at fixed halo mass has a noticeable effect on the smf at the high mass end which is also commonly referred to as eddington bias .",
    "a larger value of @xmath271 will lead to an inflated observed smf at large stellar masses .",
    "the g - g lensing signal is dominated by the central one - halo term roughly on scales below @xmath272 mpc and by the satellite one - halo term roughly on scales above @xmath272 mpc and below a few mpc ( see figure [ illustration_gg_lensing ] ) . thus , the effects of the four parameters that regulate the satellite occupation function ( @xmath273 , @xmath136 , @xmath144 , @xmath149 ) have a strong scale - dependant effect on the g - g lensing signal .",
    "for example , @xmath145 controls the power - law amplitude of @xmath122 .",
    "a smaller value of @xmath145 will reduce the ratio @xmath274 and will therefore increase the number of satellites in a sample .",
    "this will lead to an increase in the g - g lensing signal from 0.3 - 1 mpc due to the increased amplitude of the one - halo satellite term .",
    "similarly , a smaller value of @xmath144 will also reduce the ratio @xmath274 and by consequence , will increase the one - halo satellite term .",
    "this effect is more pronounced in figure [ p_variation_low ] which illustrates a low - stellar mass sample compared to figure [ p_variation_massive ] which illustrates a high stellar mass sample .",
    "another parameter worth discussing here is @xmath72 .",
    "figure [ p_variation_massive ] demonstrates that @xmath41 has a stronger effect on the lensing signal for high stellar mass samples compared to low stellar mass samples . as discussed in @xmath20 [ scatter_shmr ] , this is simply due to the fact that the data are binned according to @xmath35 .",
    "the observables are therefore sensitive to the scatter in halo mass at fixed stellar mass , @xmath70 . at fixed @xmath41",
    ", @xmath70 will increase with @xmath35 . as a result ,",
    "the effects of scatter are more prominent in g - g lensing measurements for high stellar mass samples .      to first order , the stellar mass function and the clustering of galaxies are tethered ;",
    "more massive halos are both more clustered and less abundant .",
    "this is also true of galaxies because rare , massive galaxies live in such halos . if the amplitude of the stellar mass function increases , the clustering as a function of stellar mass decreases .",
    "this is especially true at masses above the knee in the stellar mass function . from figure [ smf_dip_feature ]",
    ", increasing @xmath53 or @xmath41 increases the abundance of high - mass galaxies .",
    "given that the number of halos is fixed , this can only mean that massive galaxies are occupying less massive , less clustered halos .",
    "there are several parameters that have a direct influence on the clustering of galaxies without changing the stellar mass function appreciably . the parameters @xmath145 and @xmath144 are the most important in this regard .",
    "they control the `` shoulder '' in the hod , defined conceptually as the increase in halo mass , relative to @xmath130 , before satellites begin to enter the sample .",
    "quantitatively , this is expressed as the ratio @xmath275 , as shown in equation [ e.nsat ] . reducing this ratio increases",
    "the number of satellite galaxies in a sample , which in turn increases the large - scale bias of a sample and significantly enhances the clustering within the one - halo term .",
    "the parameters @xmath136 and @xmath149 have a more subtle effect on clustering . if the cutoff mass , defined by equation [ mcut_eq ] , is below @xmath130 , then @xmath127 has no effect on clustering .",
    "but as @xmath127 increases , satellite galaxies are removed from low - mass halos .",
    "if the density of satellites is held fixed , increasing @xmath127 redistributes satellites into more massive halos .",
    "this will increase the large - scale bias and change the shape of the one - halo term such that the correlation function deviates from a pure power law form ( see the appendix in @xcite ) .",
    "in this section we construct mock catalogs in order to investigate the effects of sample variance and covariance associated with measurements of g - g lensing , clustering , and the smf .",
    "sample variance occurs due to the finite nature of the volume encompassed by any given survey .",
    "because of limited volume , any given survey may yield a biased measurement of the number density of galaxies and halos compared to the full universe .",
    "the error bars on all three observables must therefore reflect this additional source of error .",
    "also , the data - points in all three observables will be correlated to some degree .",
    "consider the smf for example .",
    "a region of space with high matter density will have an increased abundance of galaxies of nearly all masses .",
    "for @xmath206 , because it is a projection of @xmath5which is itself a correlated quantity ",
    "multiple physical scales will contribute to each bin in @xmath276 .",
    "for @xmath156 , we will show that the data points are correlated on scales where satellite galaxies contribute to the lensing signal .    to investigate both the sample variance and the covariance associated with all three observables , we use numerical simulations to construct a series of mock catalogs for a cosmos - like survey .",
    "since the volume of cosmos is relatively small , the effects of variance and covariance will be quite apparent ( whereas the effects would decrease if we simulated a larger fiducial survey ) and so cosmos is well suited for our purpose .",
    "in addition , we will also use these mock catalogs in paper ii to analyze the actual cosmos data .",
    "cosmos - like mocks are created from a single simulation ( named `` consuelo '' ) 420 @xmath277 mpc on a side , resolved with 1400@xmath278 particles , and a particle mass of 1.87@xmath279 @xmath277 m@xmath1 .",
    "this simulation can robustly resolve halos with masses above @xmath280 @xmath277 m@xmath1 and is part of the las damas suite ( mcbride et al . in prep ) .",
    "we create mocks for three redshift intervals : @xmath281 $ ] , @xmath282 $ ] , and @xmath283 $ ] . for each redshift interval",
    ", we construct a series of mocks created from random lines of sight through the simulation volume that have the same area as cosmos and the same comoving length for the given redshift slice .",
    "this yields 405 independent mocks for the @xmath284 bin , 172 mocks for the @xmath285 bin , and 109 mocks for the @xmath286 bin . for each redshift bin",
    ", mocks are created from the simulation output at the median redshift of the bin .",
    "halos within the simulation are identified with the friends - of - friends halo finder ( @xcite ) with a linking length of b=0.2 . for each redshift interval",
    ", halos are populated with our best - fit model from paper ii .",
    "we use the mock - to - mock variance and covariance to estimate a covariance matrix for the stellar mass function , for @xmath206 ( using a series of stellar mass thresholds ) , and for @xmath156 ( using a series of stellar mass bins ) .",
    "although the data points _ between _ the different quantities will be correlated to some degree ( as well as the bins in @xmath206 and @xmath156 ) we ignore that covariance as we do not have enough simulation volume to estimate the _ uber_-covariance matrix of all [ n ] data points in each redshift bin .",
    "figure [ smf_covar_matrix ] shows the correlation coefficient matrix for the smf in three redshifts bins for a cosmos - like survey .",
    "the first - order effect of sample variance on the smf is to correlate all of the data points so that globally , the smf will shift up and down for different realizations of a cosmos - like survey .",
    "figure [ clustering_covar_matrix ] shows the correlation coefficient matrix for the galaxy clustering for @xmath79 and for three stellar mass thresholds : @xmath287 , @xmath288 , and @xmath289 .",
    "the data are more correlated at larger scales where galaxy pairs come from the two - halo term . as shown earlier , clustering at these scales",
    "is proportional to the matter clustering @xmath290 .",
    "patches of the universe that exist in an over- or under - density tend to have higher or lower clustering in their matter .",
    "this will be reflected in the clustering of the halos and thus the two - halo term for the galaxies . in the one - halo term ,",
    "poisson fluctuations of the number of satellites become more important and the data are less correlated at these scales .",
    "overall , as the density of the galaxy sample becomes smaller , shot noise will dominate on all scales .",
    "this can be seen in the progression from left to right in the examples in figure [ clustering_covar_matrix ] .",
    "figure [ gg_sample_variance ] illustrates the effect of sample variance on g - g lensing signals for various stellar mass bins and for @xmath79 .",
    "figure [ z1_lensing_covar_matrix ] shows the associated correlation coefficient matrices .",
    "the key point to note here is that the sample variance for g - g lensing is dominated by the one - halo satellite term on scales of about 100 kpc to 1 mpc .",
    "the impact of this term becomes more apparent in galaxy samples with lower stellar masses as the contribution from the one - halo central term decreases .",
    "the fact that the one - halo satellite term has a large sample variance compared to the one - halo central term can be understood as follows .",
    "consider a sample of galaxies in a given stellar mass bin .",
    "the galaxies that are satellites in this sample will tend to live in more massive halos than the galaxies that are centrals ( this can be seen in figure [ hod_bins_illustration ] for example ) .",
    "since more massive halos are more rare than less massive halos at fixed survey volume , this explains the large one - halo satellite sample variance .",
    "finally , we also use mock catalogs to estimate the effects of the integral constraint ( ic ) @xcite on clustering measurements for a small area survey . due to spatial fluctuations in the number density of galaxies ,",
    "the mean correlation function measured from an ensemble of samples will be smaller than the correlation function measured from a single contiguous sample of the same volume as the sum of the ensemble sample .",
    "this attenuation of @xmath206 becomes relevant on angular scales significant with respect to the sample size .",
    "for large surveys like the sdss , the ic is not an issue on scales of interest . for a pencil - beam survey like cosmos , however , the ic must be taken into account when modeling the clustering .",
    "we estimate the ic correction to our @xmath206 measurements through the use of the mock galaxy distributions described previously .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ ic_correction ] . for cosmos ,",
    "our fitting functions for the ic correction are :    @xmath291    @xmath292    for @xmath79 and @xmath260 respectively and where @xmath276 is expressed in arc - seconds .",
    "for @xmath293 there is sufficient volume such that @xmath294 .",
    "we note that these fitting functions are only valid for @xmath295 arcseconds .",
    "the goal of this paper is to develop the theoretical framework necessary to combine measurements of galaxy - galaxy lensing , galaxy clustering , and the galaxy stellar mass function , into a single and more robust probe of the galaxy - dark matter connection .",
    "we have achieved this goal by introducing several key modifications to the standard hod framework . to begin with ,",
    "we have modified the standard hod model so as to fit all three probes simultaneously and independantly of the selected binning scheme .",
    "next , since we are interested in the galaxy - dark matter connection , we have also modified the hod model so as to specifically include the stellar - to - halo mass relation ( shmr ) . in a companion paper ,",
    "leauthaud et al .",
    "2011b , we demonstrate that the model presented here provides an excellent fit to galaxy - galaxy lensing , galaxy clustering , and stellar mass functions measured in the cosmos survey from @xmath17 to @xmath18 .    nonetheless ,",
    "while the promise of combined dark matter probes in studying galaxy formation , gravity and cosmology is clear , we must ensure that our parametric description of the shmr is sophisticated enough to capture its possible behavior .",
    "there are a number of questions that remain to be answered in order to achieve this goal .",
    "for example , is @xmath296 well described by a log - normal distribution and is the scatter in @xmath296 constant or does it vary with halo mass ?",
    "do the parameters that describe @xmath296 vary with redshift and galaxy type ?",
    "can we marginalize over uncertainties related to the shapes and concentrations of dark matter halos ?",
    "what exactly do we learn from various probe combinations ?",
    "the challenges are steep but with increasing large data - sets such as the dark energy survey , the large synoptic survey telescope , the hypersuprime cam survey , and euclid , refined and sophisticated models can be built and constrained by the data . although the model presented in this paper is sophisticated enough to describe cosmos data , it is clear that further refinements will be necessary given the statistical precision of up - coming surveys .",
    "improving models such as the one presented in this paper by using insights provided , for example , by semi - analytic models of galaxy formation and dark matter n - body simulations , is clearly a worthy pursuit .",
