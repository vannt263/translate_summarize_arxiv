    "in superdense nuclear matter that constructs the core of a neutron star , a great amount of energy is carried away by the neutrino .",

    "the departure from equilibrium , @xmath7 , increases the phase space for nonequilibrium @xmath0 process and strongly enhances corresponding neutrino emissivity with respect to the chemical equilibrium value @xcite .",

    "we here give the graphical overview of those results for    - : :    durca reaction with superfluidity of each type ; - : :    murca reaction with isotropic superfluidity of the non - spectator    nucleon ( e.g. proton for the neutron branch ) ; - : :    murca reaction with isotropic superfluidity of the spectator nucleon    ( e.g. neutron for the neutron branch ) .    as shown in calculations , the appearance of nucleon superfluid",
    "reduces the neutrino emissivity by a factor that depends on the value of @xmath10 and of @xmath122 , the types of the beta process ( direct or modified urca ) and of superfluidity . when the quantity @xmath122 is relatively small",
    ", the superfluid reduction factors do nt change with the value of @xmath122 and become the function of only one variable @xmath10 .",
    "it should be similar with that under the condition of beta equilibrium .",
    "however , the violation of superfluid suppression on neutrino emissivity occurs when the chemical departure reaches a threshold value .",
    "the threshold tends to be the result presented by reisenegger ( @xcite ) only when the energy gap of superfluidity is large enough .",
    "it s well - known that neutrino emissivity plays a key role on the cooling of neutron stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "we recognize that although the superfluid gap suppresses dramatically the neutrino emissivity in dense matter , it is possible that the chemical imbalance of beta reaction large enough will break the suppression . meanwhile , the imbalance contributes chemical heat to neutron star core . along with the results of reaction rates calculated by villain and haensel ( @xcite ) ,",
    "our results are required for numerical simulation of neutron star cooling .",
    "we have the primary investigations on this problem .",
    "it will be reported in our another paper .",
