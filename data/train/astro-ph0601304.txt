    "we assume that the pulsar , pwn and snr are physically associated , and consequently adopt a common distance to them of @xmath5  kpc @xcite . in  [ sec_assoc ] we will discuss the validity of this assumption in the light of the new data presented here .",

    "the resulting image is @xmath7 times deeper than that from the 2000 data of o2001 .    for spectroscopy , we combined the two data - sets .",
    "we used identical source extraction regions for each observation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_main][b ] ) , and then created corresponding weighted response and effective area files using the ciao script specextract .",
    "spectra were grouped so that there was a minimum of 25 counts per channel ( with the exception of the 2000-epoch spectrum of the central source cxou  j061705.3 + 222127 [ see  [ sec_images ] ] , which was grouped to 15 counts per channel because of the low number of counts ) . for background spectra , we used annular regions immediately surrounding each of the regions shown in figure  [ fig_main](b ) .",
    "spectra were then modeled using xspec v11.3.1 . in all spectral fitting , we jointly fit the two observations from 2000 and 2005 , with all model parameters locked between the two data - sets .",
    "we identify a number of notable features from the x - ray and radio images shown in figure  [ fig_main ] :    1 .",
    "as earlier identified by o2001 , there is a bright compact source near the apex of the nebula , which they designated cxou  j061705.3 + 222127 ( hereafter ) .",

    "3 .   on larger scales , an elongated diffuse region with",
    "a `` bullet '' morphology is seen , which following from our earlier studies of the mouse ( g2004 ) , we designate `` the tongue '' . defining the tongue s perimeter to be the locus at which the emission falls to 10% of the peak in figure  [ fig_main](b ) , we find that the tongue is oriented at a position angle of @xmath12 ( n through e ) , and has an approximate extent of @xmath13 . along its major axis , the tongue extends @xmath14 ahead of , and @xmath15 behind it .",
    "the tongue is also a feature of enhanced brightness at radio wavelengths ( contours in fig .",
    "[ fig_main][b ] ) .",
    "4 .   surrounding the tongue",
    ", we identify a larger diffuse x - ray region , best seen in figure  [ fig_main](b ) , which we designate `` the tail '' .",
    "the tail has a cometary shape , but with a broader opening angle than the tongue .",
    "it is sharply bounded at its apex , but fades into the background toward the rear .",
    "the tail is the brightest part of a larger x - ray structure seen by  @xcite .",
    "we have extracted spectra for the three regions shown in figure  [ fig_main](b ) , corresponding to  , the tongue , and the tail .    to accurately estimate the foreground absorbing column , @xmath16 , we fit simultaneous absorbed power laws to the large number of counts obtained for the tongue and the tail , constrained to have the same @xmath16 , but with independent photon indices .",
    "the results are given in table  [ tab_spec ] , showing that both regions are good fits to power law spectra , with a foreground column @xmath17  @xmath18 ( this and all subsequent errors are at 90% confidence ) .",
    "the photon indices for the two regions are the same within the errors .",
    "we then fit to the spectrum of , excluding most of the emission from the compact structures immediately surrounding it by using a circular extraction region of radius @xmath19 .",

    ". a combined fit of a blackbody and a power law resolves this problem and produces an excellent fit , as listed in table  [ tab_spec ] and shown in figure  [ fig_spec ] .",
    "we have also tried to fit spectra to the compact knots seen on either side of the pulsar . however , since each knot only contains @xmath20 counts in the combined data - set , we are unable to derive useful spectral parameters for these regions .",

    "our new data clearly confirm the main result of o2001 :  consists of a compact source at the apex of a striking cometary nebula , which presumably represent an energetic pulsar and its wind - driven bow shock , respectively . here",
    "we focus on the additional information provided by the higher sensitivity and improved angular resolution of our new data .",
    "we first consider the x - ray emission from .",
    "o2001 assumed that the x - rays from  were thermal .",
    "they adopted a low absorbing column @xmath21  @xmath18 , and consequently found a very high temperature ( @xmath22  kev ) and a small emitting area ( @xmath23  km@xmath24 ) .",
    "with better statistics but limited spatial resolution , @xcite were unable to directly detect x - rays from , but found that a blackbody with a temperature 0.13  kev and radius 3.3  km was consistent with their data .    here",
    "we directly detect thermal emission from , confirming its identification as a neutron star .",
    "the blackbody component of the fit to  shown in figure  [ fig_spec ] implies an emitting radius ( as viewed at infinity ) of @xmath25  km .",
    "this is not especially constraining , being consistent both with cooling emission from the whole surface , and also with the smaller radii seen for blackbody fits to neutron star atmospheres ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the inferred temperature and bolometric luminosity , as viewed at infinity , are @xmath26  ev and @xmath27  ergs  s@xmath28 , respectively .",
    "the age estimated for  is @xmath29  years @xcite . assuming that  is associated with , has a mass in the range 1.35 - 1.45  m@xmath30 and has a 1p proton superfluid core , the neutron star s predicted surface temperature is @xmath31  ev , and its expected luminosity is @xmath32  ergs  s@xmath28 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , while we are not able to distinguish between different neutron star cooling models , the thermal emission from  is consistent with `` standard '' cooling at the age estimated for .    as discussed in  [ sec_spec ] , the x - ray spectrum of  also requires a significant non - thermal component .",
    "we interpret this as magnetospheric emission from the pulsar , which typically has a photon index @xmath33 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , consistent with the fit obtained here . in this case , we expect",
    "these x - rays to be strongly pulsed , as is seen for several other young and energetic pulsars ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "this possibility can be tested through a future observation with the  high resolution camera .",
    "we will argue in ",
    "[ sec_term ] that the tongue region in which is embedded traces the outer surface of the wind termination shock . since the region interior to this corresponds to cold , unshocked wind material which should not emit , the compact x - ray structures seen close to the neutron star likely lie outside the tongue , but projected against it .    as two emitting components on either side of the pulsar",
    ", there is the temptation to identify these structures as polar jets , as have been seen for several crab - like pwne ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such jets are now understood to be formed beyond the wind termination shock by equatorially outflowing particles which reverse in flow direction and which are then collimated along the spin axis via hoop stress @xcite . for the crab nebula ,",
    "the reversal of the equatorial flow depends on the confining thermal pressure into which the pwn expands @xcite .",
    "however , for , ram pressure produces a very different set of boundary conditions , for which it is as yet unclear if such structures can form .",
    "alternatively , x - ray knots close to the pulsar have been seen in pwne such as the crab nebula , g320.41.2 , g292.0 + 1.8 and the mouse ( * ? ? ?",

    ", such structures should define the projected spin axis of the neutron star , as has been argued for the crab pulsar and several other sources @xcite .",
    "if the projected velocity vector of  is defined by the bow - shock morphology , then  would represent an example of substantial misalignment between the pulsar s spin axis and its velocity vector .",
    "this would be in sharp contrast to other systems for which `` spin - kick alignment '' has been claimed , and would have important implications for the formation mechanism of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "alternatively , as discussed below in ",
    "[ sec_assoc ] , the pulsar may in fact be moving to the south , away from the center of snr  . in this case",
    "the spin and velocity vectors would show approximate alignment , and the bow - shock morphology would trace the effect of surrounding bulk flows rather than of the pulsar s motion .",
    "we are developing full three - dimensional hydrodynamic models of bow shocks with anisotropic outflows to address these possibilities @xcite .",
    "cometary x - ray nebulae behind moving neutron stars have now been seen by  and  for several sources ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "however , what our new data make clear is that is clearly structured into two distinct components : the bright tongue , and the fainter surrounding tail .",
    "we previously identified this same spatial decomposition for the mouse , and adopt a similar interpretation here : namely that the bullet - shaped tongue region represents the surface of the wind termination shock , while the tail corresponds to shocked material flowing downstream ( see g2004 for detailed arguments and discussion ) .",
    "we directly resolve the separation between  and the apex of the tongue , and so can infer a forward termination shock radius @xmath34  pc . there is also a clear termination of the tongue behind , so we also infer a backward termination shock radius @xmath35  pc , where @xmath36 is a factor which accounts for smearing of the backward termination shock as a result of ions in the wind ( see  4.5 of g2004 ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath37 is a direct diagnostic of the mach number , @xmath38 , of the system . for low mach numbers ,",

    "this bow shock is only mildly supersonic , in sharp contrast to the mouse for which we found @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "this is consistent with the expected conditions : the mouse is moving through the interstellar medium ( ism ) where the sound speed is low , while if  is in the snr interior where the sound speed of hot shocked gas is high , we expect @xmath46 ( see fig .",

    "* ) , illustrating the large uncertainties in all these indirect estimates of @xmath56 .",
    "another difference between the mouse and  is the morphology of the tail . for the mouse",
    "the tail has a narrow component seen in both radio and x - rays , enveloped by a broader region seen at radio wavelengths .",
    "g2004 interpreted this as material shocked at the backward and forward termination shocks , respectively .",
    "for the latter , the flow speed is @xmath67 times higher , but the magnetic field is stronger .",
    "the resultant synchrotron losses explain its lack of x - ray emission .",
    "in contrast to the mouse , here the tail is composed of a single broad structure , with good correspondence between radio and x - rays .",
    "this difference can be understood as follows .",
    "conservation of energy leads us to expect that @xmath68 ( see eqn .  [ 13 ] of g2004 ) , where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the nebular magnetic field strengths in the flow from the forward and backward termination shocks , respectively .",
    "in this case we find @xmath71 , a ratio @xmath67 times smaller than that seen in the mouse .",
    "factoring in the difference in flow speed between the forward and backward flow regions @xcite , the synchrotron loss times for the two zones now become comparable .",
    "we thus expect a single combined region emitting in both the x - ray and radio bands , as observed . the power laws of the tongue and tail regions have similar photon indices ( see table  [ tab_spec ] ) , indicating that radiative losses are minimal over the @xmath72  pc scale imaged by . at distances",
    "@xmath73  pc downstream , the x - ray spectrum begins to soften due to synchrotron losses , as seen by  @xcite .      as mentioned in ",
    "[ sec_intro ] , there are difficulties with the claimed association between  and .",
    "most notable is the fact that the nebular symmetry axis is completely misaligned with respect to the vector running from the snr s center to  ( see fig .  [ fig_wide ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the failure to detect a period and period derivative for  prevents us from estimating the pulsar s age and comparing it to that of the snr , while the wide range in @xmath16 seen toward different parts of  in previous x - ray studies makes it difficult to determine whether the pwn and snr are at similar distances .",
    "however , the results presented here provide new evidence in favor of a physical association .",
    "first , the surface temperature measured for is consistent with the age of 30000 years inferred for the snr .",
    "second , as discussed in ",
    "[ sec_neb ] , the differences in morphology between and the mouse imply that either the confining media or the pulsars have very different properties . specifically , if we repeat the estimates made in ",
    "[ sec_term ] , but now for a pulsar not embedded inside a snr but rather moving through a typical warm region of the ism ( @xmath74  ; @xmath75  ergs  @xmath61 ) , we find @xmath76  and @xmath77  ergs  s@xmath28 .",
    "the former is slower than 98% of the young pulsar population @xcite , while the latter would imply a @xmath78 efficiency of conversion of spin - down luminosity into the total x - ray luminosity of the system , which is higher than observed for any other pulsar and its pwn ( cf .",
    "* g2004 ) .",
    "the properties of the pwn thus argue that the pulsar wind is most likely confined by hot gas in the snr interior .    given these arguments for a genuine association , we then need to explain the misaligned nebular symmetry axis .",
    "a possible explanation is that the explosion site did not coincide with the snr s geometric center .",
    "this can result if the progenitor star had a high space velocity , so that the supernova exploded at an offset position within a wind - blown cavity @xcite .",
    "the pulsar s velocity vector is then directed away from the explosion site , rather than from the snr center .",
    "note that the offset between the explosion site and the snr s center is probably not as extreme as suggested by the observed morphology , since gas flows in the snr interior are likely to be skewing the orientation of .",
    "this can be tested by future observations : combining the estimates of @xmath50 and @xmath49 made in  [ sec_neb ] above , we expect a proper motion for of @xmath79  mas  yr@xmath28 at a position angle of @xmath80 , north through east",
    ". this may be measurable 510 years hence .",
    "our new  observations of reveal a thermally - emitting neutron star with a typical space velocity of @xmath1  , whose relativistic wind drives a bow shock through the shocked gas inside its associated snr  .",
    "we place this system midway between psr  b1853 + 01 / snr  w44 ( for which the pulsar bow shock is deep in the interior of the snr ) and psr  b1951 + 32 / snr  ctb  80 ( for which the pulsar is now crossing the snr shell ) in the evolutionary sequence described by @xcite .",
    "while pulsations from the central source in  have not been detected in the radio band , pulsed magnetospheric emission may be detectable in future deep x - ray observations",
    ".    shows a close correspondence with the mouse , in that the x - ray emission from both sources consists of two distinct components , a `` tongue '' and a `` tail '' .",
    "the specific differences between these features in  and in the mouse can be understood in terms of the much lower mach number of the pulsar for .",
    "the presence of these features in two systems , and our ability to interpret them consistently in terms of the expected wind shock structures , argue that these are ubiquitous features in pulsar bow shocks .",
