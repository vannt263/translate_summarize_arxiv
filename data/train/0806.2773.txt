    "the study of chemically peculiar a stars with magnetic fields has ramifications for several other branches of astrophysics . the interaction among strong magnetic fields , atomic diffusion and energy transfer in ( or above ) the upper atmospheres of non - degenerate stars has direct implications for observed stellar abundances and for the instability of stellar pulsations in @xmath1cephei and sdb stars .",
    "the magnetic field lines guide the diffusing elements , so that some ions will be concentrated where the field lines are vertical while others will group where the lines are horizontal ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the very different magnetic field strengths , orientations and geometries , as well as the great variety of abundance distributions for ap stars are therefore particularly informative .",
    "magnetic fields affect spectroscopic lines through , e.g. , broadening , intensification and zeeman splitting of the intrinsic lines @xcite .",
    "several cool ap stars show light and spectral variability that follow the stellar rotation , and such stars are known as @xmath2 canum venaticorum ( @xmath2cvn ) variables .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the observed light , spectrum and magnetic variations are related . in particular , they suggested that photometric variability may result from a redistribution of flux either by variations in line blanketing or opacity , such as enhanced absorption at rare earth maximum .",
    "the light variability may vary with that of the rare earths which appear to be concentrated predominantly near the region of the strongest magnetic field or that of the negative pole .",
    "thus can light variability be linked to magnetic field variability which , for oblique rotators , follows the stellar rotation .",
    "magnetic activity cycles similar to the solar 11-y cycle are observed in f ",
    "m stars @xcite and are related to chromospheric activity .",
    "however , chromospheres have not been unambiguously detected in ap stars .",
    "finally , magnetic fields drive winds through alfvn waves or other magneto - hydrodynamic waves @xcite .",
    "the chemically peculiar b , a and f stars ( henceforth ap stars ) have globally organised , typically dipole or quadrupole fields that with an axis obliquely inclined to the rotation axis of the star so that , for dipolar fields , one or both magnetic poles come into , or out of , view with rotation . the full geometry of the field may hence be visible for stars with favourably oriented rotation and magnetic axes , which in turn makes it possible to use the zeeman doppler imaging technique to create magnetic field maps . among the ap stars is babcock s star = hd215441 @xcite , the non - degenerate star with the strongest field known , 34.4 kg",
    ". the only other published cases with extremely strong fields are : hd137509 , @xmath3 kg @xcite , hd154708 , @xmath4 kg @xcite and hd178892 , @xmath5 kg @xcite .",
    "the atmospheres of ap stars are complex to interpret . as a consequence of vertical abundance stratification , and non - standard temperature gradients , even theoretical modelling of hydrogen line profiles , such as the core - wing anomaly in the h@xmath6 lines @xcite ,",
    "is not yet completely successful @xcite .",
    "however , the observational and theoretical efforts in understanding the ap atmospheric processes may eventually prove ` worth the candle ' thanks to their general applicability ; the ap stars are the most extreme examples of magnetic fields and atomic diffusion in non - degenerate stars , processes common in most other stars .",
    "examples of studies of atmospheric abundance stratification in a cool ap star subgroup , the rapidly oscillating ap ( roap ) stars are given by @xcite .",
    "these studies are in agreement with each other , in general : fe is concentrated by gravitational settling in the observable layer between @xmath7 and pr and nd are concentrated by radiative levitation above @xmath8 .",
    "the pr and nd forming layers are above the line forming layer of the narrow core of the h@xmath6 line which in standard a star models is in the range @xmath9 .    magnetic field measurements are mostly based on difficult , indirect measurements , such as magnetic broadening of spectral lines and spectropolarimetric observations of longitudinal magnetic fields or the line - of - sight field component . the mean longitudinal magnetic field ( or , the longitudinal field ) @xmath10 is a weighted average over the visible stellar disk of the component of the magnetic vector along the line of sight @xcite , and is typically at least 3 times weaker than the mean magnetic field modulus @xmath11 ( see sect.[sec : mag ] for definition of this ) . the first large survey for magnetic fields in non - degenerate stars was done by @xcite .",
    "it has since been followed by many other studies of individual stars or groups of stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recent searches for magnetic stars were carried out by @xcite who discovered @xmath12 magnetic stars , and by @xcite who discovered 57 magnetic ap stars .",
    "the total number of firmly established magnetic chemically peculiar main - sequence stars is currently @xmath13 ( romanyuk , 2008 , in prep . ) for a significant fraction of these magnetic stars the variation in the longitudinal magnetic field has been measured as a function of rotation period ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such curves provide valuable information about the global geometrical structure of magnetic fields .",
    "better and more reliable measurements are necessary to obtain a complete understanding of the many phenomena related to magnetic fields . for this purpose , magnetic ap stars with resolved magnetically split lines provide extremely favourable conditions , since one can determine in a straightforward , mostly approximation - free , model - independent manner , and with particularly good precision , the mean magnetic field modulus @xcite .",
    "however , in spite of many studies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , only 51 such stars were known @xcite , prior to this work .",
    "our discovery of 17 new such stars therefore significantly increases the number known .    at present , 40 roap stars are known ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , although several surveys have searched for rapid pulsation in ap stars , such as @xcite . for a ( non - exhaustive ) list of spectroscopic studies of roap stars , see @xcite .",
    "the roap stars are thought to be characterised by , e.g. , the h@xmath6 and by an _ ionization disequilibrium _ for ndii and ndiii and for prii and priii @xcite , the latter caused by stratification of those two elements to levels above @xmath14 by atomic diffusion .",
    "other typical spectral characteristics are strong magnetic fields , wing - nib anomaly in k @xcite , and strong abundances of rare earth elements and relatively slow rotation .",
    "it is therefore possible to identify promising roap star candidates with a single , high signal - to - noise ratio , high - resolution spectrum before spending time on a large telescope with fast spectroscopy to search for rapid pulsations .    in 2006",
    "we therefore began a systematic survey of cool ap stars in the photometric ` cape cool ap star catalogue ' @xcite to identify roap candidates based generally on a single high - resolution spectrum of each star .",
    "the cape catalogue gives strmgren @xmath15 and @xmath1 photometry for over 500 ( almost all ) of the srcreu subclass of cool ap stars listed in the michigan spectral catalogues , volumes @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "perhaps surprisingly  given the importance of the ap stars to stellar astrophysics , and the long history of their study  there is no large - scale , uniform spectroscopic survey such as the one we are now conducting .",
    "we expect the data set to be a rich source of discoveries , and to be the basis of uniform statistical analyses of many of the astrophysically interesting characteristics of the class .    our first observing season is finished and of 140 stars",
    ", we identified dozens of stars with magnetically intensified , broadened or even resolved lines .",
    "of these , 17 are new detections with magnetically resolved or partially resolved lines , in particular for the zeeman doublet 6149.258(figs[fig : fe6149a][fig : fe6149b ] ) .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , this line is particularly important as a diagnostic for a magnetic field as the splitting provides a direct measure of the mean magnetic field , and furthermore because iron is usually rather homogeneously distributed over the surface of ap stars .",
    "this is the discovery paper for the new ap stars with magnetically resolved lines , and we provide magnetic field strengths , projected rotation velocities and selected relative abundance estimates . of particular interest , we discovered a new star with an extremely large magnetic field ; a highly peculiar magnetic star ; and an uncommon magnetic ap star in a relatively close binary system .",
    "we also re - observed the recently discovered magnetic ap star hd92499 @xcite to check for stability of its magnetic field strength , abundances and radial velocity .    in the following sections , we describe the selection and observation of the targets along with the data reduction in sect.2 . then follows the data analyses , including estimation of physical parameters and the magnetic measurements in sect.3 .",
    "finally we discuss the results in sect.4 .",
    ".[tab : obslog]observing log indicating target , equatorial coordinates , instrument ( uves , ` u ' or feros , ` f ' ) , mid - exposure heliocentric julian date ( hjd ) , exposure time , number of co - added spectra , if any , and @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath17 ratio were measured in the 2-d spectra around 5500 .",
    "for co - added spectra , hjd gives the mid - series time , and the total exposure time and combined @xmath17 are given .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^ , < , > \" , ]     the observations were collected using the fibre - fed extended range optical spectrograph ( feros ) with the 2.2-m telescope at la silla during four nights starting 2007 february 06 .",
    "follow - up observations were made for selected stars about one month later with the vlt uv - visual echelle spectrograph ( uves ) during three nights starting 2007 march 11 ( see the logbook of observations in table[tab : obslog ] ) .",
    "both instruments are echelle spectrographs and cover the wavelength ranges 35309220  at the spectral resolution @xmath18 ( feros ) and 49707010   ( with a 60-   wide gap near 6000 ) at @xmath19 ( uves ) .",
    "the uves instrument was used with an image slicer and an 0.3arcsec slit , while feros was used with a stellar fibre ( 1.8arcsec aperture ) while the second ( sky ) fibre was not used .",
    "the spectra were reduced to 1-d with the respective pipelines provided by eso with the standard calibration data ( bias , flatfield and thorium - argon wavelength reference spectra ) . as indicated in the observing log ( table[tab : obslog ] ) spectra of the same star were co - added if barycentric velocity corrections were small compared to the bin sizes of the spectra ( that was typically the case within 40min ) .",
    "table[tab : obslog ] gives the signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath17 henceforth ) of the spectra measured in the 2-d spectra around 5500  ( for co - added 1-d spectra , the stated @xmath17 is for the composites ) .",
    "the spectra were normalized to unity continuum level in an iterative manner : major slopes were eliminated with a spline fit to a stacked spectrum of stars with relatively many continuum windows , then a second but more detailed spline fit was made and applied to the spectra on a star - by - star basis .",
    "finally , a detailed spline fit was made by identifying continuum regions through comparison with a synthetic spectrum .",
    "this process eliminated flux undulations of lengths similar to the individual echelle orders , but also broad depressions from the strongest diffuse interstellar bands and possibly some of the broadest depressions typical of cool ap stars .",
    "the photometric databases asas ( all sky automatic survey , @xcite ) and the _ hipparcos _ catalogue @xcite were used to search the 18 targets for long - period ( days to years ) photometric variability .",
    "the asas light curves are sparsely sampled , typically one measurement per @xmath20 nights ( causing obvious 1  aliases ;  is cycles per day ) , but cover @xmath21 years with @xmath22 measurements and are therefore well suited to check for variability linked with stellar rotation .",
    "of 5 available apertures we used the largest and for the @xmath23-band . in seven cases ( see notes in table[tab : targets ] ) , periodic variability was found above @xmath24mmag amplitude and interpreted as @xmath2cvn rotational variability .",
    "all frequency searches were made using period04 @xcite up to the pseudo - nyquist frequency ( @xmath25  for the asas data ) .",
    "the shortest period found in these cases is a good candidate for the rotation period for stars where only a single spotted region is within view .",
    "however , if two such spots come into view during a rotation cycle ( such as orientations where both magnetic poles can be seen during each rotation cycle ) , then the light curve becomes a double - wave ( see fig.[fig : hd88701 ] ) which for similar spots may be mistaken for a single sine wave , thus resulting in a mis - identification of only half the true rotation period .      for the purpose of spectral line identification ,",
    "a synthetic comparison spectrum was produced with synth @xcite using a kurucz stellar atmosphere model .",
    "atomic line data were taken from the vienna atomic line database ( vald , @xcite ) for ions with increased abundances , mainly for nd , pr , sr , cr and eu .",
    "other sources used for line data were the atomic database nist and the database on rare earth elements at mons university ( dreamastro / dream.shtml ] ; @xcite ) through its implementation in the vald .",

    "comparison with the relative estimates for hd92499 by @xcite shows reasonable agreement within the errors ( differences may be explained by a possible inhomogeneous chemical surface distribution )",
    ".    further limitations of our simple analysis include : sensitivity of the derived abundances to errors of the photometric temperature estimates ( we find , e.g. , that @xmath107k may correspond to 233 per cent differences in equivalent width for the elements in table[tab : abundance ] , worst for pr ) ; and choice of microturbulence @xmath108 for which a change of 1  may infer a change in abundances comparable to their stated errors ( especially nd , see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    conventionally , microturbulent motions are those with characteristic lengths that are small compared to the mean free path of a photon . the value of @xmath108 is normally increased to simulate the effect of a strong magnetic field ( magnetic intensification ) , but also chemical stratification ( which may dominate the errors of our relative abundances by increasing the differences in abundance yields from weak and strong lines ) produces effects adverse to microturbulence . because of horizontal inhomogeneities and vertical stratification of the studied sample of magnetic ap stars , abundance analysis is a demanding task ( see examples of such studies in the introduction ) and is outside the aim of the present discovery paper .",
    "we are here interested in relative abundances to verify peculiar abundances and different abundances between elements of different ionization states . for this purpose ,",
    "the estimated abundance errors of @xmath105 dex are acceptable .",
    "table[tab : abundance ] gives the relative abundances found , and comments on the individual stars are given in sect.[sec : individual ] .",
    "we used 3070 lines of the 5 elements per star , but the actual selection of lines varied from star to star .",
    "note that the models used for hd135728 had the simplifying assumption of a combined continuum of two similar stars ( with the same luminosity and spectral type ) . in their study of spectroscopic signatures of roap stars , @xcite note the following pr and nd anomalies , expressed as differences in @xmath109 of second and first ionized states , for roap stars ( further including the recent roap discoveries hd116114 and hd137909 ) @xmath110_{\\rm iii - ii}=-0.22 $ ] to 2.19 and @xmath111_{\\rm iii - ii}=0.14 $ ] to 2.55 .",

    "neither of these systems , if confirmed , are of the importance of hd135728ab and further observations are planned to determine the orbital period and use spectral disentanglement to study the abundances of both its components in detail .",
    "the most important discovery , hd75049 , has the second - largest known magnetic field of any ap star and was found to be highly variable in magnetic field strength and fine - structure over a time scale of 30d .",
    "the extremely strong magnetic field may not only rival , but even surpass the strength of babcock s star ( hd215441 ) , 34.4 kg .",
    "follow - up is in progress of this very interesting object .",
    "hd96237 was shown to exhibit extreme abundance variations , possibly related to a photometric variability of 22d that may be the rotation period .",
    "extreme abundance variations with stellar rotation are known from more slowly rotating stars , such as hr465 ( hd9996 ; @xcite ) for which eu , cr , ca , sr vary up to a factor of 3 in line strength ( cr and eu in antiphase ) .",
    "a magnetic field was detected and measured .",
    "we compared the spectra of hd96237 with those of the arguably most peculiar ap star , hd101065 , and demonstrated comparable levels of peculiar abundances .",
    "hd96237 is remarkable by also exhibiting fast abundance variations .",
    "follow - up studies are currently in progress of this important star .    from light curves in the asas database ,",
    "the stars hd75049 , hd88701 , hd96237 , hd110274 , hd121661 , hd117290 and hd92499 were shown to be @xmath2cvn variables .",
    "two periods were detected for hd75049 , while hd88701 exhibits a clear double wave . hd117290 and hd92499",
    "show , as the only cases , variability longer than the time span covered by the photometry ( 35 years ) .",
    "there are some implications of the rotation periods found from the asas data and the measured rotational velocities , since these constrain the stellar radii and thus luminosities .",
    "an example we discussed is hd88701 for which the rotation period and @xmath32  implied an unexpectedly large radius .",
    "however , uncertainties in @xmath32  measurements , sensitive to line - blending and magnetic broadening and the possibility of an asas period only being half of the rotation period ( in case of double - wave light curves ) leaves some uncertainties .",
    "furthermore , astrometric luminosities suggest that at least half the stars are near the terminal end of the main - sequence , so that larger radii are to be expected in comparison with younger ap stars .",
    "included among our original sample 140 cool ap stars is hd92499 , a known magnetic star with zeeman splitting @xcite .",
    "our new spectra showed a constant magnetic field modulus and radial velocity of the star .",
    "as our target selection is relatively unbiased among more than 500 cool ap stars , the fraction of such stars with magnetically resolved lines appears to be 13 per cent based on the first part of our ap star survey .",
    "abundance estimates were used to identify nd and pr ionization disequilibrium anomalies in abundances of ions in the two first ionized states .",
    "hd44226 , hd96237 and hd143487 showed significant abundance anomalies ( @xmath444dex ) and are in addition to hd92499 excellent roap candidates . with 32min time - series spectroscopy of hd143487",
    ", we demonstrated a low - amplitude candidate period of 2mhz that , however , could not be confirmed by individual lines .",
    "we emphasise that the lack of accurate _",
    "@xcite parallaxes @xmath445 $ ] for the newly detected magnetic stars presented in this paper means that absolute magnitudes are considerably more difficult to determine because of the peculiar spectra of these stars .",
    "we note that for a subset of the stars having parallaxes , their relatively clustered location in the h - r diagram indicates that many of these are stars near the end of their main - sequence lifetimes .",
    "this new sample of stars with directly measured magnetic fields will aid studies of magnetic field interaction with stellar atmospheres .",
    "polarimetric measurements are needed to establish geometry of the detected fields and to determine or confirm the rotation periods of the stars .",
    "we are currently obtaining high time resolution spectroscopy with uves for 16 of the 18 stars in this study to search for rapid pulsations .",
    "the exceptions are hd75049 , which is too hot to be a roap star , and hd135728ab , which is an sb2 system .",
    "we thank the referee , dr stefano bagnulo for a careful reading of the paper and many suggestions that helped to improve it .",
