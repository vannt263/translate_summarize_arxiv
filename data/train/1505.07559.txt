    "weak processes such as @xmath0-decay rates , electron capture , neutrino scattering and absorption play an important role during the late evolution of massive stars  @xcite .",
    "they are largely responsible for the electron fraction in the core during the core - collapse phase and they continue to play a determinant role in the nuclear synthesis @xmath5-process  @xcite . because of their great importance in astrophysical applications ,",
    "weak processes were extensively investigated within various approaches .",
    "the large - scale shell model monte carlo ( smmc ) method was , for instance , applied to compute @xmath6 decay rates for stellar conditions for more than 100 nuclei in the mass range a = 45 - 65  @xcite .",
    "recently , mean - field based models have been used for the prediction of electron - capture cross sections and rates .",
    "finite - temperature charge - exchange rpa ( cerpa ) models based on skyrme or relativistic functionals have been applied to predict electron - capture cross sections using different interactions  @xcite .",
    "mean - field predictions around the fermi energy are , however , known to suffer from their underestimation of the density of states . in this work , we explore a small correction to the mean field models which increases the density of states around the fermi energy  @xcite . here , we compare the predictions of this model to known experimental values such as @xmath0 half - lives or collective modes , as a first step before using it for astrophysical applications .    since the pioneering work of brown et al .",
    "@xcite it is known that the level density around the fermi energy in stable nuclei indicates that the in - medium nucleon effective mass is close to the bare mass .",
    "the description of giant resonances such as the giant dipole resonance requires , on the other hand , that the nucleon effective mass in the nuclear medium should be reduced as compared to its value in vacuum  @xcite .",
    "analysis of the momentum dependence of the nuclear optical potential also favors an in - medium effective mass lower than in vacuum  @xcite .",
    "these apparently diverging properties of the in - medium effective mass @xmath7 can be reconciled by considering the two contributions to @xmath7 : the @xmath8-mass which is also called the non - locality mass , and the @xmath9-mass which is induced by dynamical correlations such as particle - phonon coupling  @xcite .",
    "the coupling of the collective modes to the single - particle ( s.p . )",
    "motion is , however , difficult to perform in a self - consistent approach .",
    "one of the main problems is coming from the fragmentation of s.p .",
    "strength which increases exponentially at each iteration of the self - consistent method .",
    "it has therefore been tried to include these correlation directly in the mean field , either at the level of the interaction with density - dependent gradient terms  @xcite , or , loosing the relation with an interaction , at the level of the nuclear energy density functional ( edf ) so as to produce a surface - peaked effective mass ( spem ) which , at the same time , does not strongly modify the mean - field  @xcite . in this study , we will explore the second approach .",
    "predictions of @xmath0-decay rates throughout the nuclear chart within a consistent microscopic nuclear model are difficult .",
    "tuning of models according to the system under study is usually performed , and the description of @xmath0-decay rates through a unique microscopic nuclear model does not exist . since @xmath0-decay rates are known to depend strongly on the fine structure around the fermi level , the difficulties to have a general description could be related to the common issue with mean - field models that the s.p .",
    "level density around the fermi level is too low .",
    "the increase of the level density , by using for instance a model producing a spem could , in principle , lead to a better description of @xmath0-decay rates throughout the nuclear chart .    in microscopic approaches ,",
    "calculations of nuclear @xmath0 -decay rates are rather complex . due to phase - space amplification effects , the calculated @xmath0-decay rates are sensitive to both nuclear binding energies and @xmath0-strength functions . in an appropriate @xmath0-decay model , the correct amount of the integral @xmath0-strength should be placed within the properly calculated @xmath10-window provided that the spectral distribution is also close to the `` true '' @xmath0-strength function .",
    "furthermore , for consistency the model has to yield correct positions and strengths of the gamow - teller ( gt ) and first - forbidden resonances in the continuum  @xcite .",
    "another complication is related with the large - scale predictions of nuclear @xmath0-decay rates .",
    "such a program is a compromise between accurate results and the necessity to cover extended regions of the nuclear chart including deformed nuclei or even the region with triple prolate - oblate - spherical shape coexistence scenario . in this work",
    ", we shall consider only the case of spherical nuclei .",
    "a plausible way to detect a change of the @xmath0-decay strength function profile due to higher - order corrections could be the analysis of the integral characteristics of @xmath0-decay .",
    "the half - life is one of such characteristics , being sensitive enough to the @xmath0-strength distribution  @xcite .",
    "it is worth to analyze first the doubly - magic @xmath11-unstable nuclides , such as @xmath2sn , since one can use the simpler cerpa model .",
    "also , we compare to the most neutron - rich ( @xmath12 ) doubly - magic nucleus @xmath1ni which is an important waiting point in the r - process  @xcite",
    ". the next step would then be to study the delayed neutron and especially delayed multi - neutron emission  @xcite .",
    "this is a more difficult task since the delayed neutron emission probability ( @xmath13-value )  @xcite puts an additional constraint on the @xmath0-strength distribution in the near - threshold region .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .  ii we briefly present the modifications to the nuclear edf which produce a spem , and we describe the protocol used to adjust the strength of this correction . in sec .",
    "iii , we analyze the results of the calculations of @xmath0-decay rates in @xmath1ni and @xmath2sn and the properties of the giant quadrupole resonance ( gqr ) and gamow - teller resonance ( gtr ) of @xmath14pb .",
    "conclusions are drawn in sec .  iv .",
    "skyrme - type edf are known to give an accurate description of masses and charge radii over the whole nuclear chart , from @xmath15 up to heavy elements  @xcite . as most of the mean - field approaches ,",
    "they however lead to a s.p .",
    "level density around the fermi surface which is lower than the experimental one  @xcite . here",
    ", we introduce a correction term to the skyrme edf which leads to a spem and increases the average s.p .",
    "level density  @xcite .",
    "we hereafter present this correction term and then briefly describe the calculations of @xmath0-decay rates carried out consistently in the framework of hartree - fock - cerpa approach .",
    "the standard skyrme functional for the time - even energy density is expressed as  @xcite @xmath16 where the indices @xmath17 stand for the isoscalar and isovector part of the corresponding densities , respectively .",
    "for instance , the nucleonic densities @xmath18 and @xmath19 are defined as , @xmath20 where the densities @xmath21 ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) are expressed in terms of the s.p .",
    "wave functions @xmath24 as @xmath25 the kinetic energy and spin - current densities , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , are defined similarly  @xcite .",
    "the coefficients @xmath28 in eq .  (",
    "[ eq : functionalt ] ) are constants ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) except for the coefficient @xmath29 which depends of the isoscalar density @xmath18 as : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the saturation density in infinite nuclear matter .    the standard skyrme functional",
    "can be separated into neutron and proton channels , and neutron and proton effective masses are introduced : @xmath32 , \\label{eq : effmassq}\\ ] ] then , neutron and proton mean fields can be obtained ( see appendix  [ app : npc ] ) .    among the large number of skyrme parametrizations , we have selected 6 of them based on the following requirements :    * first",
    ", the skyrme edf should predict @xmath3sn as a @xmath0-unstable nucleus at the mean field level .",
    "this is based on the common expectation that the landau parameter @xmath33 in the spin - isospin channel is repulsive and will shift up the gt strength . *",
    "second , we wish to explore different values of effective mass in the bulk , and different isospin splittings of the effective mass .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     , for the gt strength distribution obtained within the cerpa .",
    "the experimental centroids of the gtr is at 19.2 mev  @xcite . ]",
    "let us examine whether the spem could improve the agreement between the model predictions and the experimental values .",
    "as one can see from tables iii , iv and v the inclusion of the terms  ( [ f ] ) leads to minor effects on the @xmath34 values .",
    "we find that the spem induces an increase of the transition energies and it results in a decrease of the half - lives .",
    "we first concentrate on the models slyiii0.7 , slyiii0.8 and slyiii0.9 , which correspond to different values of the effective mass in symmetric matter . from the comparison of the theoretical predictions with the experimental half - lives shown in tables  [ tab : res1 ] , [ tab : res1p ] and [ tab : res2 ] , it is difficult to conclude which model is better : for @xmath3sn , the model slyiii0.8 is preferred , for @xmath1ni and @xmath4sn , it is slyiii0.7 . now , if we concentrate on the models f@xmath35 , f@xmath36 and f@xmath37 , it is f@xmath35 which always comes the closest to the experimental value .",
    "this indicates that , in addition to the effective mass , the residual interaction is very important .",
    "it was already anticipated that the value of the landau parameter @xmath33 for the selected models ( cf .",
    "table  [ tab : bulk ] ) could have an impact on charge - exchange related observables .",
    "for the models f@xmath35 , f@xmath36 and f@xmath37 the values of @xmath33 are too small .",
    "since the impact of the spem on the @xmath0-decay rates in @xmath1ni and @xmath4sn is quite small , these nuclei could be , in the future , used to calibrate the residual interaction almost independently from the profile of the effective mass .",
    "the modification of @xmath33 could be obtained from a refitting of the skyrme functional with a different value of the strength of the spem .",
    "one could increase @xmath33 by about 0.1 - 0.2 by introducing the spin - density dependent extension of the skyrme model  @xcite .",
    "this will be left for future investigations .    up to this point , we have mostly focused on the relation between the spem and the low energy part of the strength , since it represents the main contribution to the @xmath0-decay rates .",
    "we now turn to the higher energy part and show in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] and [ fig : fig3 ] the effects of the spem on the properties of the gqr and gtr in @xmath14pb . in the figures ,",
    "the calculated strength distributions are folded out with a lorentzian distribution of 1 mev width .",
    "the excitation energies refer to the ground state of the parent nucleus @xmath14pb .",
    "the arrows indicate the maxima of the strength distributions corresponding to the case of the @xmath38 model and @xmath39=0 mev @xmath40 .",
    "since the isoscalar quadrupole ewsr is changed by only about 1% by the spem , we expect the collective modes at higher energy to be only marginally impacted .",
    "the gqr strength distribution consists mostly of a main peak . comparing the cases without spem and with maximal spem , we find that the peak is shifted down by about 500  kev .",
    "one can notice that the gqr strength distribution is almost identical for the three models @xmath41 , @xmath38 and @xmath42 .",
    "as can be seen from table  [ tab : res3 ] , while the @xmath43 energy is practically unaffected by the spem , the b(e2 ) value is decreasing as the spem increases .",
    "some overestimate of the experimental energy indicates that there is room for the two - phonon effects  @xcite .",
    "the gtr is much more fragmented than the gqr , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "the strength distribution is globally shifted up as the isospin splitting is going from positive ( f@xmath35 ) to negative values ( f@xmath37 ) . as in the case of the gqr ,",
    "the high energy peaks of the strength distribution are shifted to lower energies ( by about 500 kev ) as the spem gets larger .",
    "this is an effect of the slight increase of the level density induced by the spem .",
    "starting from different skyrme edf which predict @xmath3sn @xmath0-unstable , we have studied the effects of introducing a surface - peaked effective mass on top of existing skyrme models .",
    "the main effect of this additional term is a compression of the s.p .",
    "level spacing around the fermi level , or equivalently , an increase of the level density .",
    "this systematically increases the @xmath0-decay rates ( i.e. , decreases the half - lives ) .",
    "the collective modes at higher energy are only slightly impacted by the spem .",
    "this work is a first step towards improving skyrme functionals by adding extra terms to the energy functional .",
    "our motivation is based on both having a better agreement with nuclear data , and also predicting weak transition rates for astrophysical applications .",
    "the results of our analysis allow for a better understanding of the effects at play .",
    "the @xmath0-decay rates in doubly - magic unstable nuclei ( @xmath2sn , @xmath1ni ) are indeed very sensitive both to the s.p .",
    "energies and residual interactions , and none of the skyrme models selected in this work are fully satisfactory in this respect . from our analysis , we have however identified two nuclei ( @xmath4sn , @xmath1ni ) where the @xmath0-decay half - lives are only weakly impacted by the spem . they can be considered as good benchmark nuclei since they potentially offer the possibility to calibrate the residual interaction , with a weak influence of the effective mass . in a complementary approach , @xmath3sn could be used to test different strengths of the spem , for a fixed residual interaction .",
    "the tensor force has not been considered in this work , although it can affect the neutron - proton s.p .",
    "energies in some cases .",
    "we have aimed at understanding just the contribution of the spem to the @xmath0-decay and gt mode in order to disentangle the respective roles of the effective mass and the residual interaction .",
    "an additional modification of the skyrme functional was proposed earlier in order to stabilize the nuclear matter equation of state  @xcite .",
    "it has been recently used in nuclei and , since it brings an additional repulsive term to the @xmath33 landau parameter , it was shown to shift the centroids of the gt collective mode to higher energies by a few hundreds kev up to 1 mev  @xcite . in the future , we plan to explore the predictions of a general mean field model including all these ingredients , and to compare them to known experimental data , as done in this work .",
    "these calibration processes are important to set - up boundaries for the additional parameters before making predictions for astrophysical cases .",

    "<S> possible improvements of these different parts could therefore be better constrained in the future . </S>"
