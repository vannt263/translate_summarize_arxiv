    "gdel s incompleteness theorem is undoubtedly one of the most important theorems in logic .",
    "it speaks about absolute provability , i.e. , about proofs without any restriction on their size .",
    "the question whether there is a `` finite '' or `` feasible '' version of the incompleteness theorem , where the complexity of proofs is bounded , has certainly intrigued many people , but very little has been published about it . with the advent of computers and theories developed for them , in particular",
    "complexity theory , the question about a finite version of the incompleteness theorem became even more interesting .",
    "the concept of polynomial time computations turned out to be the most important concept in complexity theory .",
    "the distinction between functions decidable in polynomial time and those computable only in exponential time plays a similar role as the distinction between computable and non - computable in the computability theory .",
    "the successful use of polynomial bounds suggested that one should also study which theorems have polynomial size proofs . a natural version of a finite incompleteness theorem was formulated by harvey friedman in  1979 .",
    "let @xmath1 be a natural formalization of the statement _ `` there is no derivation of contradiction of length @xmath2 from the axioms of @xmath3''_. friedman proved a lower bound of the form @xmath4 for some @xmath5 and asked whether such sentences have proofs in @xmath3 of polynomial length  @xcite .",
    "it turned out that the answer to his question is yes  @xcite , but this is not important , because for natural variations of this question it is still possible , and seems very plausible , that there are no polynomial length proofs .",
    "namely , this should be true if we ask about the lengths of proofs of @xmath1 in a theory @xmath6 sufficiently _ weaker _ than @xmath3 .",
    "however , proving such a claim must be extremely difficult , because it implies @xmath7 ( and even more than that ) .",
    "we have to face the fact that the present - day mathematics lacks methods to solve such problems .",
    "nevertheless there there is something we can do .",
    "the fundamental question is _ what is the connection between logical strength of theories and computational complexity ? _ which is basically what the field of _ proof complexity _ is studying .",
    "for example , buss s witnessing theorem states that one can construct polynomial time algorithms from proofs of certain sentences in the theory @xmath8",
    "such theorems have been proven for a number of other theories and complexity classes .",
    "another connection is the feasible interpolation theorem of krajek  @xcite . according to this theorem",
    ", one can construct circuits from proofs of certain tautologies in various proof systems , in particular , in resolution .",
    "( such theorems have been proven also for other proof systems . ) a high level form of these results is that if something is provable in a weak formal system , i.e. , the logical strength of the system is bounded , we can give bounds on some computational problems associated with the systems .",
    "if we state it contrapositively it suggest that increasing strength of logical formal systems is correlated with increasing complexity of the associated computational tasks .",
    "thus a more specific question is : _ find general principles of which these results are special instances .",
    "_    in constructive mathematics there is a very close connection between proofs and computations .",
    "there are also results that show interesting connections with computational complexity .",
    "for example , buss and mints  @xcite proved that given an intuitionistic proof of a disjunction @xmath9 in propositional logic ( say , in the sequent calculus ) , then one can find _ in polynomial time _ a proof of either @xmath10 or @xmath11 .",
    "however , in this paper we will only consider classical logic .",
    "the reason is that in what we study here , the underlying logic is not important .",
    "what is essential are proof systems and axioms used . considering intuitionistic logic would only be a restriction on the systems we could use , while we are interested in formal systems that are as general as possible .",
    "the general principles that we study are connected with notoriously open and probably very difficult problems in computational complexity theory , so we can not prove or disprove them with the currently available means .",
    "they can only be stated as hypotheses or conjectures without any formal supporting evidence .",
    "alternatively , we can view them as axioms .",
    "there are , essentially , two reasons for stating some sentences as conjectures .",
    "first , we believe that some basic theorems of proof theory should also hold true with suitable bounds on the lengths of proofs .",
    "the prime example is the second incompleteness theorem discussed above .",
    "second , some results in proof complexity and bounded arithmetic seem to follow a general pattern .",
    "for example , as we noted above , polynomial time computations are associated with the theory @xmath8 by a witnessing theorem . if we take @xmath12 , which we believe is a stronger theory , then the corresponding function class is @xmath13 , which we believe is a larger class than * p*. the form of this result suggests that @xmath12 requires more complex functions .",
    "( we are not able to prove it formally , because a formal proof would give us @xmath14 , which is equivalent to @xmath15 . )",
    "although we have to treat the most interesting statements only as hypotheses , there are some interesting problems that we can study and solve with the currently available means .",
    "these are problems about relationships among various conjectures . in particular",
    ", we would like to know whether there is one general principle that would cover all instances , or there is an infinite hierarchy . if there is a hierarchy , is it linear , or does it branch ?",
    "if it branches , is there a natural classification of conjectures ?",
    "we will address some questions of this kind in this paper .",
    "furthermore , one can study relativizations of these conjectures .",
    "several results about relativizations have been proven , but much more is needed .",
    "we are primarily interested in these question , because we want to understand the essence of fundamental problems .",
    "however , there is also a practical aspect of this research .",
    "the general conjectures suggest what specific problems in proof complexity we should study",
    ". then we can `` test '' the conjectures on weak formal systems for which we do have means to prove results connecting them with computational complexity .",
    "in fact the main conjectures  con and  tfnp represent what researchers in proof complexity believe is likely to be true .",
    "all conjectures that we consider in this paper state something about unprovability , although they often have a natural equivalent version stated in purely complexity - theoretical terms .",
    "the `` finite domain '' in the title refers to the fact that the lengths of computations and lengths of proofs of instances of the problems that we consider are at most exponential , hence there is a _",
    "finite _ bound on them .",
    "perhaps , a more precise term would be `` exponential domain '' . in previous presentations of this topic ,",
    "in particular in  @xcite , we used the term _",
    "`` feasible incompleteness '' , _ which should be understood as _ `` being incomplete with respect to feasible proofs '' .",
    "_ in  @xcite we also stated _ the feasible incompleteness thesis _",
    ", which is an informal statement saying that unprovability of a sentence in a weak formal system may be caused by high computational complexity of a computational problem naturally associated with the sentence",
    ".    here is a brief outline of this paper .",
    "after two introductory sections , in section  [ sec3 ] , we recall the conjecture about finite consistencies and introduce a new conjecture about finite reflection principles . in section  [ sec4 ]",
    "we present another important conjecture about total polynomial search problems .",
    "we discuss equivalent and stronger statements based on propositional proof systems and disjoint * np * and * conp * pairs of sets in section  [ sec5 ] .",
    "we introduce a classification of conjectures in section  [ sec6 ] and show that uniform conjectures can be stated as statements about unprovability , which suggests a way towards general conjectures .",
    "section  [ sec8 ] is about the role of reductions in the statements of conjectures .",
    "we conclude the paper with some open problems .",
    "we will need the concept of a sufficiently strong arithmetical theory , where theory means a set of axioms in first order logic .",
    "this concept appears in the classical incompleteness theorems .",
    "restricting to arithmetical theories is not essential .",
    "fragments of arithmetic , as those theories are called , are used , because one can easily refer to standard formalizations of basic syntactical concepts .",
    "being able to formalize syntactical concepts , such as first order formulas and proofs , is the essential property of the theories that we need .",
    "the concept of a sufficiently strong arithmetical theory is used in conjectures that we study in this paper .",
    "the form of these statements guarantees that they do not depend on a particular formalization of the concept of a sufficiently strong theory ; nevertheless , it is good to be more precise .",
    "we denote by @xmath16 the class of all _ consistent _ theories that extend buss s theory @xmath8 by a set of axioms that is decidable in polynomial time .    for a lack of a good name , we will only use the symbol @xmath16 to denote this class of theories .",
    "theory @xmath8 is one of the fragments of bounded arithmetic @xmath17 defined by buss  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "formally , it is not a fragment of @xmath18 ( peano arithmetic ) , because it is formalized in a slightly richer language , but it is interpretable in it . it is a natural fragment of arithmetic in which polynomial time computations can be defined .",
    "since the choice of the base theory is not essential , the reader not familiar with @xmath8 can safely replace it , e.g. , by the much stronger theory @xmath18 . the theory @xmath8 is a natural choice for the base theory , also because in this theory one can easily define some classes of formulas that we will need .",
    "we assume that the theories in @xmath16 are formalized in the language of @xmath17 .",
    "we could allow extensions by symbols representing other polynomial time computable functions and relations , but it would not give any advantage .",
    "we will assume that proofs are formalized in a standard hilbert - style proof system for first order logic .",
    "we will view the proofs as strings of formulas such that each formula is either an axiom ( logical or an axiom of the theory in question ) or is derived from previous formulas by an application of a deduction rule .",
    "the particular choice of the system makes little difference , but note that we do need to consider proof systems with the rules of modus ponens , or cut , and the proofs must be linear , not trees . a proof in a theory @xmath3 will be simply called a _ @xmath3-proof_.    an essential property of our theories and the proof system",
    "is that given a sentence @xmath10 and a string of symbols @xmath19 , it is possible to decide in polynomial time if @xmath19 is a proof of @xmath10 .",
    "this is also the reason why we only use theories with sets of axioms in * p*.    further we need to define * np * and * p * predicates and relations in theories from the class  @xmath16 . having @xmath8 as the base theory , the natural choice of formulas for *",
    "np * are @xmath20 formulas defined by buss .",
    "the hierarchy of formulas @xmath21 is similar the the arithmetical hierarchy @xmath22 the difference being that we count the alternation of _ bounded quantifiers_. in @xmath20 ( and similarly in higher classes ) bounded existential quantifiers may alternate with sharply bounded universal quantifiers where sharply bounded means that the bound is polylogarithmic .",
    "this complication can be avoided by slightly extending @xmath8 with more function symbols and axioms .",
    "if we do this , then we can move all sharply bounded universal quantifiers after the bounded existential ones .",
    "the @xmath23 formulas where all sharply bounded quantifiers are after all bounded quantifiers are called _ strict-_@xmath23 , or @xmath24 formulas .",
    "the language of @xmath17 has a function symbol for the binary function @xmath25 which from two numbers of length @xmath26 and @xmath27 produces a number of length @xmath28 .",
    "thus the terms in bounded quantifiers give polynomial upper bounds on the _ binary lengths _ of the quantified numbers , rather than polynomial bound on the numbers , as the terms of @xmath18 do . in order to simplify formulas we will sometimes use quantifiers with a superscript @xmath29 to indicate that the lengths of the quantified variables are polynomially bounded in the formula that follows .",
    "for example , @xmath30 means that @xmath31 is equivalent to a formula @xmath32 for some formula @xmath33 and some polynomial @xmath34 .    for * p * , there is no simple definition of a class of formulas .",
    "formulas from the class @xmath35 have only sharply bounded quantifiers .",
    "these bounds imply that they define sets and relations computable in polynomial time , but we can not define all sets in * p * by such formulas . the standard approach is to extend the language by function symbols for every polynomial time algorithm as it is in cook s theory @xmath36  @xcite .",
    "this requires also adding infinitely many axioms specifying the intended interpretation of each function symbols .",
    "the relation of @xmath36 to @xmath17 is similar to the relation of primitive recursive arithmetic to peano arithmetic . in this paper",
    "we will use a different approach , one that does not need an infinite number of function symbols and axioms . a formula",
    "@xmath37 is @xmath38 provably in a theory @xmath3 if @xmath39 and , for some @xmath40 , there exists a @xmath3-proof of the sentence @xmath41 _ in this paper @xmath38 will always mean provably in @xmath8 . _ by buss s witnessing theorem , the provability of the equivalence in @xmath8 ensures that @xmath37 defines a set in  * p*. we should stress that it is essential that the proof is in @xmath8 .",
    "the equivalence @xmath42 in general only ensures that @xmath37 defines a set in @xmath43 which is believed to be larger than * p*. ( again , this particular representation of predicates in * p * is not essential . )",
    "we will also need to represent binary relations computable in polynomial time .",
    "the definition of the corresponding @xmath38 formulas is the same , except that one uses two variables instead of one .",
    "polynomial time computable functions will be formalized by @xmath38 formulas defining the graphs of these functions .",
    "we will use _ binary numerals_. a binary numeral is a suitably chosen closed term @xmath44 whose value is @xmath2 and whose length is @xmath45 .",
    "our computation model is the standard turing machine , where the inputs are words in the alphabet @xmath46 .",
    "when computing with numbers , we assume the binary representation . we will use numbers instead of binary strings when we formalize computations . for @xmath47 ,",
    "we denote by @xmath48 the length of the binary representation of @xmath2 .",
    "there is a symbol for this function in the language of @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath49 . we will denote by @xmath50 a formula expressing ( in a natural way ) the fact that there is no @xmath3-proof of contradiction of length @xmath51 . in particular , we will need @xmath1 , for @xmath47 .",
    "the question mentioned in the introduction is :    what is the length of the shortest @xmath3-proof of @xmath1 ?",
    "using the analogy with gdel s incompleteness theorem , it is natural to conjecture that the proof must be long , specifically , not polynomial .",
    "friedman also proved a lower bound @xmath4 for some @xmath5 .",
    "is @xmath45 . ]",
    "this lower bound was improved to @xmath52 for a proof system with the rule @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a new constant  @xcite .",
    "this rule enables one to refer to an element satisfying @xmath10 without having to mention @xmath10 .",
    "the same asymptotic bound is probably true for some other systems where this rule can be simulated . in particular , in natural deduction systems , we can start with an assumption @xmath55 and argue about @xmath56 without having to repeat the assumption in each proof line .",
    "the idea of the proofs of these lower bounds is to adapt the original proof of gdel for the finite setting .",
    "thus instead of the original diagonal formula , one uses a formula @xmath57 with intended meaning _",
    "`` i do not have a @xmath3-proof of length @xmath58''_. one can easily prove that @xmath59 is true and any proof of it must be longer than @xmath2 .",
    "then one proves that @xmath59 can be derived from @xmath1 by a short proof .",
    "this is essentially the same as in the proof of gdel s theorem , except that one has to prove good _ upper bounds _ on the lengths of proofs of certain true sentences .",
    "the shorter proofs one is able to find , the larger the lower bound is .    in @xcite",
    "a linear upper bound @xmath60 was proved for sequential theories .",
    "this bound is based on partial truth definitions . in the standard proofs of the consistency of a theory @xmath3 ( without any bound on the lengths of proofs ) ,",
    "one uses a truth definition for all formulas . since in proofs",
    "of bounded length only formulas of bounded complexity can occur , it suffices to use a partial truth definition that define truth only for sentences of limited complexity .",
    "the fact that partial truth definition exist is well - known .",
    "however , to obtain such bounds one has to carefully estimate the size of the formulas and the lengths of proofs of particular statements .    in spite of the linear upper bound",
    ", we still believe that the incompleteness phenomenon of gdel s theorem should manifest itself also in the finite domain .",
    "we conjecture that if @xmath3 is stronger than a theory @xmath6 , then @xmath6-proofs of @xmath1 can not be polynomially bounded .",
    "since it is not clear how much stronger @xmath3 must be , we proposed the following conjecture in  @xcite :    con@xmath61[conn ] for every @xmath62 , there exists @xmath49 such that @xmath6-proofs of @xmath1 can not be polynomially bounded .",
    "stands for `` nonuniform '' whose meaning will be explained in section  [ sec6 ] . ]    of course , we would also like to know how much stronger @xmath3 must be than @xmath6 so that there are no polynomial size @xmath6-proofs of @xmath63 .",
    "it has been conjectured that it suffices that @xmath3 proves the consistency of @xmath6 , i.e. , the following seems to be true :    con@xmath64 for every @xmath65 , if @xmath3 proves @xmath66 , then @xmath6-proofs of @xmath1 can not be polynomially bounded .",
    "it is well - known  @xcite that if @xmath3 is stronger ( proves more sentences ) than @xmath6 , then some sentences provable in both theories have much shorter proofs in @xmath3",
    ". this may suggest that it would suffice to make @xmath3 just a little stronger than @xmath6 in order to ensure that @xmath6-proofs of @xmath1 do not have polynomial proofs . however , recently pavel hrube proved , using a rosser - type selfreferential sentence , that in general it is not so [ personal communication ] .",
    "his result is even stronger than the mere refutation of that statement .    for every @xmath65",
    ", there exists a true @xmath67 sentence @xmath68 such that @xmath68 is not provable in @xmath3 , yet the lengths of @xmath6-proofs of @xmath69 can be bounded by a polynomial .    in particular , if @xmath70 , we get @xmath71 unprovable in @xmath6 with polynomially bounded @xmath6-proofs of @xmath69 .",
    "recall that the sentences expressing consistency of a theory @xmath3 are special cases of _ reflection principles _",
    "( see  @xcite ) .",
    "there are many versions of reflection principles . here",
    "we will focus on the uniform @xmath72-reflection principles .",
    "the _ uniform @xmath72-reflection principle for @xmath3 _ is the following schema for all @xmath72 sentences @xmath37 with one free variable @xmath51 @xmath73 where @xmath74 denotes the function that assigns the gdel number to formula @xmath10 and @xmath75 says that @xmath76 is a proof of @xmath10 in @xmath3 .",
    "the principle is true if @xmath3 is @xmath72-sound , i.e. , @xmath3 does not prove a false @xmath72 sentence .",
    "the schema can be axiomatized by a single sentence using a partial truth definition for @xmath72 formulas . in order to get a meaningful finite version of @xmath77 we have to make a couple of modifications .",
    "we start by defining a finite @xmath78 reflection principle for one formula .",
    "let @xmath3 be a theory , let @xmath79 be a @xmath20 formula and let @xmath47 .",
    "then @xmath80 will denote the sentence : @xmath81    having defined the reflection principle for one formula , we can study the schema , i.e. , the set of sentences @xmath80 for all @xmath20 formulas , but it is more interesting to have a single sentence for every @xmath2 from which all instances are derivable by short proofs . to this end",
    "we need a universal @xmath20 formula .",
    "one can construct a formula @xmath82 such that for every @xmath20 formula @xmath79 there exist a natural number @xmath83 and a polynomial @xmath84 such that |z|p(|x|)((x )  _ 1(|e , x , z ) ) is provable in @xmath8 ( see  @xcite ) .",

    "the structure of these sentences is determined by    some class @xmath352 of sentences    associated with computational problems @xmath353 , and    some complexity hierarchy @xmath354 of the associated problems .",
    "the conjectures say that the more difficult the associated computational problem is , the more difficult is to prove the sentence .",
    "consider , for example , conjecture  disjnp .",
    "in this conjecture we have sentences expressing that two sets defined by @xmath20 sentences are disjoint .",
    "these sentences are of the form : @xmath355 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are @xmath20 sentences defining the two sets .",
    "these sentences are equivalent to universally quantified @xmath174 sentence , but they are just some specific universally quantified @xmath174 sentences . for such sentences , a natural task is , for a given @xmath51 , to decide which of the two @xmath356 or @xmath357 is true .",
    "the complexity hierarchy of the computational problems is defined using polynomial time reductions .    in conjecture  con , the sentences expressing that a propositional proof system @xmath175 is sound are also universally quantified @xmath174 sentences .",
    "they have the form @xmath358 where @xmath359 is a @xmath38 formula expressing that @xmath56 is a @xmath175-proof of @xmath51 .",
    "the structure of these sentences is similar , but the length of @xmath56 in the second formula is not polynomially bounded in the length of @xmath51 .",
    "we associate with these formulas the same computational task , but we use a different kind or reductions to define the hierarchy ( in the first case , a reduction can map @xmath51 to another element , but we do not care about the witnesses of the @xmath20 formulas ; in the second case , @xmath51 does not change , but we map a witness @xmath56 to another witness ) .    ideally , we would like to state a general conjecture from which our current conjectures would follow as special cases .",
    "however , to be able to do that , we first need to fully understand what are the classes @xmath352 whose sentences can be associated with computational tasks , what are the computational problems @xmath353 , and what are the complexity hierarchies @xmath354 .",
    "so far we only have examples .",
    "in propositions  [ pr-6.1 ] and  [ pr-6.2 ] we saw that conjectures whose statements used reductions can be equivalently stated without referring to any concept of polynomial reduction . in this section",
    "we will explain how polynomial reductions naturally appear when we compare the logical strength of sentences .    when we are comparing sentences from some class @xmath352 , we do it with respect to some base theory @xmath3 .",
    "thus for some @xmath360 , we are asking whether @xmath361 .",
    "one can show that at least for some type of sentences and some theory @xmath3 , the provability implies the existence of a reduction .",
    "let the base theory be @xmath8 and the sentences have the form @xmath362 , where @xmath10 is @xmath20 .",
    "we will show that provability of one sentence from the other implies the existence of a polynomial reduction of one * tfnp * problem to the other .",
    "the following is a well - known fact ( see  @xcite ) , but we will still give a proof , because we want to argue that it can be generalized to stronger theories .",
    "suppose that @xmath363 and s^1_2x^py.(x , y)u^pv.(u , v ) , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 define polynomial time computable relations .",
    "then the * tfnp * problem defined by @xmath11 is polynomially reducible to the * tfnp * problem defined by @xmath11 .",
    "this proposition is an immediate consequence of the following result ( see  @xcite ) . if @xmath364 , where @xmath116 is @xmath365 , then for a given @xmath51 , one can compute @xmath56 such that @xmath366 using a polynomial time oracle turing machine with any oracle that , for a given @xmath51 and @xmath56 such that @xmath367 holds true , produces some @xmath161 such that @xmath368 holds true .",
    "write the implication in  ( [ pr - red ] ) in the following prenex form @xmath369 by the lemma , there is a polynomial time turing machine @xmath125 that computes @xmath51 and @xmath194 from a given @xmath76 using any oracle that whenever @xmath370 holds true produces a witness for @xmath56 .",
    "we want to use an oracle that only produces witnesses for @xmath371 .",
    "clearly , such an oracle suffices .",
    "if @xmath125 asks a query @xmath372 such that @xmath373 is true , then we can stop , because we already have a witness for @xmath374 .",
    "if no such query occurs during the computation of @xmath125 , we get @xmath51 and @xmath194 such that @xmath375 is true , which is equivalent to @xmath376 .",
    "but the antecedent is always true , so we have @xmath373 .    if the base theory @xmath3 is stronger than @xmath8 , we believe that we nevertheless get some class of reductions that is probably stronger than polynomial time computable reductions , but still somewhat restricted so that the classes of * tfnp * equivalent with respect to these reductions do not completely collapse .",
    "these reductions should be defined using the provably total search problems of  @xmath3 .",
    "the idea is that the provably total polynomial search problems of @xmath8 are the problems solvable in polynomial time and this gives us reductions that are polynomial time computations with oracle queries to which we substitute solutions of the problem to which we are reducing the given problem .",
    "similarly , if @xmath377 is the class of provably total polynomial search problems of @xmath3 , then provability in @xmath3 should give us reductions that are problems from @xmath377 with oracle queries .",
    "a special case of this appeared in  @xcite ( not quite explicitly ) where the theory was @xmath378 and the class of search problems was * pls*. although it may be interesting to study such reductions in general , we believe that they would give the same conjectures if used instead of polynomial reductions .",
    "in this paper we put forward the thesis that there exists a connection between the complexity of problems associated with first order sentences and their logical strength manifested as impossibility to prove them in weak theories .",
    "if we interpret this thesis in a broad sense , then the thesis is true ; e.g. , we can not prove in a weak theory that some computation stops if the problem requires extremely long time to be solved . however , our argument here is that there may be such a connection already on the very low level , namely in the domain of problems solvable in nondeterministic polynomial time .",
    "since the current state of research into such low complexity classes does not have means to prove separations of low complexity classes , we can only state and compare hypotheses about such a connection .",
    "there are two basic conjectures which have equivalent formulations and come in some flavors .",
    "the first one is about finite consistency statements and was proposed already a long time ago  @xcite .",
    "the second one is more recent and concerns provably total polynomial search problems .",
    "we showed how they are related to some weaker statements and some stronger ones .",
    "some of these statements had already been studied before .",
    "there are still may problems that need to be solved if we want to fully understand this topic ; some are of a fundamental nature , some are more specific .",
    "some problems have already been mentioned in previous sections .",
    "below we briefly mention some more .",
    "the main problem , mentioned in subsection  [ sec - general ] , is to find a general conjecture about incompleteness and computational complexity .",
    "the conjectures we studied in this paper should be special cases of it .",
    "construct an oracle with respect to which conjecture  disjconp is true .",
    "construct oracles that show that relativized conjectures are different or show that they are equivalent for pairs of conjectures presented in this paper .",
    "apparently the only separation that is known is a separation of conjectures  con and  disjnp , see  @xcite .    in order to get more evidence for conjecture  tfnp , characterize provably total polynomial search problems in stronger systems of bounded arithmetic .",
