    "we present higher dynamic range images together with analysis and interpretation of model fits and a spectral index map .",
    "the quasar 3c  279 was observed on two consecutive days during the ao1 phase of the vsop mission : on 1998 january 9 at 1.6  ghz , and on 1998 january 10 at 5  ghz .",
    "the vsop mission uses the japanese halca satellite as an element in a changeable vlbi array in order to obtain visibility measurements on baselines larger than the earth s diameter .",
    "halca was launched on 1997 february 12 and carries an 8 meter antenna through an elliptical orbit with an apogee height of 21,400  km ( yielding baselines up to 2.6 earth diameters ) , a perigee height of 560  km , and an orbital period of 6.3 hours .",
    "halca has operational observing bands at 1.6 and 5  ghz ( 18 and 6 cm ) .",
    "the data from the satellite are recorded by a network of ground tracking stations and subsequently correlated with the data from the participating ground telescopes .",
    "the vsop system and initial science results are discussed by hirabayashi et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "the observations of 1998 january 910 were conducted using the standard vsop observing mode : two 16 mhz intermediate frequency bands , each 2-bit sampled at the nyquist rate in left circular polarization , for a total data rate of 128 mbps .",
    "the ground telescope arrays were made up of nine elements of the nrao very long baseline array ( vlba )  hancock did not observe because of a power failure  with the addition of the 70 m telescopes at goldstone , california , u.s.a . and tidbinbilla , australia on january 9 , and the 64 m telescope at usuda , japan on january 10 .",
    "the total observing time on january 9 was 6 hours , including 3.5 hours of halca data from the tracking station at green bank , west virginia , covering the portion of halca s orbit from near perigee to near apogee .",
    "the data from goldstone were not used in the final image as it observed for only a short time and there were significant calibration uncertainties with this data .",
    "the total observing time on january 10 was 10 hours , although for the final 1.5 hours only mauna kea , usuda and halca observed and this data was also excluded from the final image ( as four telescopes are required for amplitude self - calibration ) .",
    "this observation included two halca tracking passes of 3 hours each ( separated by 4 hours ) by the tracking stations at robledo , spain and goldstone , california , u.s.a .",
    "each tracking pass covered the portion of halca s orbit from near perigee to near apogee .",
    "the data from both observations were correlated at the vlba correlator in socorro . through the remainder of this paper , we use `` vsop '' to refer to the halca+ground - array combination .",
    "calibration and fringe - fitting were done with the aips software package .",
    "3c  279 is a strong source , and good fringes were found to halca during all tracking passes .",
    "the antenna gain for saint croix had to be adjusted upward by a factor of @xmath14  2 from its nominal value at 5  ghz since the vsop observations were conducted at 48004832mhz because halca s performance is better at these frequencies .",
    "figure  1 shows the @xmath15 plane coverages of the two observations",
    ". these @xmath15 plane coverages result in highly elliptical beams : the major to minor axis ratio of the 5  ghz beam is 8:1 .",
    "the addition of tidbinbilla to the 1.6  ghz observation improves the north - south coverage and reduces this ratio to 4:1 .",
    "plots of correlated flux density vs. @xmath15 distance projected along a position angle of @xmath16 ( the position angle of the brightest structure ) are shown in figure  2 .",
    "the addition of halca extends the projected @xmath15 distances compared to the ground - only baselines from 120 to 340 m@xmath17 at 5  ghz , and from 65 to 120 m@xmath17 at 1.6  ghz .",
    "the beating evident in the correlated flux densities indicates that on milliarcsecond scales the morphology is dominated by two components of similar flux density .",
    "images from these datasets were produced using standard clean and self - calibration procedures from the difmap software package ( shepherd , pearson , & taylor 1994 ) .",
    "figure  3 shows two images from the 5  ghz observation on 1998 january 10 : the full - resolution space vlbi image and the vlba - only image made from the same dataset with the space baselines removed .",
    "figure  4 shows the full - resolution space vlbi and the vlba - only images from the 1.6  ghz observation on the previous day ( tidbinbilla baselines were also removed from this ground - only image to reduce the size of the @xmath15 holes ) .",
    "the vsop images are displayed using uniform weighting ( although cleaning was done with both uniform and natural weighting to model the extended structure ) , while the vlba images are displayed with natural weighting .",
    "we stress the importance of using uniform weighting with vsop datasets .",
    "a naturally weighted vsop image degrades the resolution of the ground - space array because of the higher weighting of the larger ground antennas and the much denser sampling of the @xmath15 plane on the ground baselines .",
    "the vsop and vlba - only images differ in scale by about a factor of four , showing the greatly increased resolution provided by the space baselines .",
    "the vsop images presented in figures  3 and 4 are the highest resolution images yet produced of 3c  279 at these frequencies .",
    "the 1.6 and 5  ghz vsop images have formal dynamic ranges ( peak : rms ) of 1,500:1 and 2,000:1 respectively , demonstrating that high dynamic range images can be made despite the small size of the halca orbiting antenna . for comparison ,",
    "the vlba - only images have dynamic ranges of 5,000:1 and 15,000:1 respectively .",
    "the 5  ghz vsop image shows that on small angular scales 3c  279 is dominated by a double structure .",
    "this structure consists of the compact core and inner jet region ( the feature to the east ) and a bright jet component about 3  mas from the core along a position angle of @xmath16 ( the feature to the west ) .",
    "this bright jet component , ` c4 ' , is a well known feature first observed in 1985 .",
    "this component will be discussed further in @xmath18  [ comps ] .",
    "the structure on slightly larger angular scales is quite different .",
    "the 5  ghz vlba image and the 1.6  ghz vsop image both show the double structure mentioned above ( although in the 1.6  ghz image the jet component is brighter than the core which results in the jet component being placed at the phase center ) , as well as a more extended jet to the southwest along a position angle of approximately @xmath19 .",
    "this position angle is similar to that seen in older vlbi images ( see @xmath18  [ comps ] ) as well as vla and merlin images ( de pater & perley 1983 ; pilbratt , booth , & porcas 1987 ; akujor et al .",
    "the resolutions of the 5  ghz vlba image and the 1.6  ghz vsop image are roughly equal , a fact that allows a spectral index map to be made from these images ( @xmath18  [ index ] ) .",
    "the jet emission in the 1.6  ghz vsop image is quite complex , and it appears in figure  4 that the jet may be limb brightened .",
    "however , we caution against over - interpreting these complex jet features because the clean striping produced by the holes in the @xmath15 plane coverage runs parallel to the jet , and because simulations indicate that , due to the lack of complete @xmath15 plane coverage , space vlbi images may show such knotty structure when the actual brightness distribution is smoother ( d. murphy 1999 , private communication ) .",
    "the 1.6  ghz vlba image shows structure extending out to @xmath14  100  mas from the core , all the way out to the smallest size scales sampled by the 22ghz vla images of de pater & perley ( 1983 ) .",
    "the difmap model - fitting routine was used to fit elliptical gaussian components to the visibility data for each image in figures  3 and 4 . when model fitting vsop data , it is important to increase the weight of halca over the default weighting used by difmap in order for the space baseline data to have any effect on the model .",
    "we increased the weight of halca during model fitting by a factor equal to the product of the ratios of the average ground baseline sensitivity to the average space baseline sensitivity ( @xmath14  50 for these observations ) and the number of ground visibilities to the number of space visibilities ( @xmath14  10 for these observations ) .",
    "this effectively achieves a `` uniform '' weighting during model fitting , and causes the space visibilities to have an effect on the model fitting equal to that of the ground visibilities .",
    "the results of the model fitting are given in table  [ mfittab ] .",
    "component numbers are given only for ease of later reference , and are not meant to identify the same component between images .",
    "tentative component identifications obtained from the discussion in @xmath18  [ comps ] are given in the third column .",
    "note that the lower resolution images ( e.g. the 1.6 ghz vlba image ) may not properly split the flux between the core and the closest component . in each case",
    "we have taken the far northeastern component to be the core , and have defined the other component positions relative to the position of the core . in the 1.6  ghz vsop image ,",
    "the southwestern jet is too complex to be fit with simple gaussian components , and we left the clean components in this region during model fitting .",
    "when fitting elliptical components , the model fitting chi - squared statistic is frequently minimized by an ellipse of zero axial ratio .",
    "this is unphysical in the sense that these components have formally infinite brightness temperatures . in these cases",
    "an upper limit to the size of the component can be used instead of the best - fit value to find a lower limit to the brightness temperature .",
    "since we use an error analysis method to find these limits in @xmath18  [ tb ] , we have left these zero axial ratio components in the models if they minimize the chi - squared for that model .",
    "table  [ mfittab ] also gives the source frame brightness temperatures for the vsop models , where the maximum brightness temperature of a gaussian component is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the flux density of the component in janskys , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the fwhms of the major and minor axes respectively in mas , @xmath24 is the observation frequency in ghz , and @xmath6 is the redshift .",

    "a major difficulty in making spectral index maps lies in correctly registering the two images .",
    "we investigated several alignments of these two images , including aligning the peak core pixels and aligning the peak pixels in the bright jet component ( c4 ) .",
    "we doubled the number of pixels across each image in order to measure the required shifts as accurately as possible .",
    "aligning the peak core pixels produced unphysical results , including a highly inverted spectral index along the right edge of component c4 .",
    "of the different alignments tried , aligning the peak pixels in the jet component c4 produced the most physically reasonable results .",
    "the reason for this can be seen _ a posteriori _ from figure  5 .",
    "the spectral index is constant across component c4 , meaning that the brightest pixels in c4 at 1.6 and 5  ghz will represent the same physical location . on the other hand ,",
    "there are steep spectral index gradients across the core region , so the peak pixel in the core region will be at different locations at 1.6 and 5  ghz .",
    "we also constructed a map of the error in the spectral index ; this error map is shown in figure  6 .",
    "the error was calculated by standard propagation of errors , using the fluxes at each pixel in each residual map as the flux errors .",
    "this method actually gives a lower limit to the error at each pixel , because it does not take into account calibration errors or errors in imaging the source structure caused by the holes in the @xmath15 plane coverage . in the region comprising the southwestern jet the errors in the spectral index @xmath32 range from @xmath33 in the brighter parts of the jet ( the knot at @xmath14  18  mas ) to @xmath34 in the fainter parts",
    "the formal errors in the core and c4 regions are quite low and so the errors in these regions will be dominated by the other effects mentioned above .",
    "the core of 3c  279 has an inverted spectrum with steep spectral index gradients .",
    "such inverted spectra are commonly interpreted as being due to self - absorption of the radio synchrotron emission .",
    "the calculated spectral index in the core region ranges from @xmath14  1.0 at the western edge to the theoretical limiting value for synchrotron self - absorption of 2.5 ( assuming a constant magnetic field ) over a small region at the eastern edge .",
    "spectral indices approaching this theoretical value are almost never seen ; the flatter spectra usually observed are commonly interpreted as being due to an inhomogeneous source made up of a number of synchrotron components with differing turnover frequencies ( e.g. cotton et al .",
    "the highly inverted spectrum at the eastern edge may imply the detection of a homogeneous compact component in this region , which should be an efficient producer of inverse compton gamma - rays .",
    "the spectral index gradients in the core imply that components will have different measured separations at different frequencies .",
    "we do indeed observe this frequency - dependent separation , the measured separation between the core and c4 model components is 3.3  mas at 5  ghz and only 2.8  mas at 1.6  ghz .",
    "the fact that the apparent position of the core is a function of wavelength is an important verification of the twin exhaust model , which argues that the observed core is that position in the throat of a nozzle where the opacity is of the order of unity .",
    "the jet component c4 has a flat spectrum with @xmath32 approximately 0.25 .",
    "this is unusual , as jet components usually have steeper spectra ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the southwestern jet also has structure in its spectral index distribution , with the edges of the jet appearing to have a steeper spectrum than the center .",
    "this spectral index structure is related to the apparent limb brightening at 1.6  ghz which , as noted above , should be interpreted with care .",
    "vsop observations of 3c  279 at 1.6  ghz in which the baselines to the orbiting antenna have a different orientation in the @xmath15 plane will allow a consistency check on the brightness and spectral index structures transverse to the jet .",
    "space vlbi observations have a major advantage over ground - based observations because they are able to measure higher brightness temperatures .",
    "this is because the smallest measurable major and minor axes in equation  [ [ tbeq ] ] are proportional to the resolution of the interferometer , which is proportional to 1/(baseline @xmath12 frequency ) , so the denominator in equation  [ [ tbeq ] ] depends only on baseline length . the brightness temperature limit for ground - based vlbi is @xmath36 and that for space vlbi with halca is @xmath37 , where @xmath21 is the flux density in janskys , @xmath6 is the redshift , and @xmath38 is the smallest size that can be measured expressed as a percentage of the beam size .",
    "the improvement gained by space vlbi thus covers the interesting transition region around @xmath39  k , the nominal inverse compton brightness temperature limit ( kellermann & pauliny - toth 1969 ) .",
    "observed brightness temperatures are often used to calculate doppler beaming factors by assuming an intrinsic brightness temperature and using the fact that @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the observed source frame brightness temperature , @xmath42 is the intrinsic brightness temperature , and @xmath43 is the doppler factor .",
    "the intrinsic brightness temperature depends on the physical mechanism imposing the limitation .",
    "kellermann & pauliny - toth ( 1969 ) showed that inverse compton losses limit the intrinsic brightness temperatures to @xmath44  k , otherwise the source can radiate away most of its energy on a timescale of days .",
    "readhead ( 1994 ) proposed that the limiting mechanism is equipartition of energy between the particles and magnetic field , and that intrinsic brightness temperatures are limited to @xmath45  k.    to be complete , brightness temperature measurements must be presented with associated errors . since the brightness temperature depends on the product of the major and minor axes of the model - fit component , and these axis sizes can have large errors , the measured brightness temperature can also have large errors .",
    "error analysis of vlbi model - fit parameters has historically been problematic . in this paper",
    "we use the `` difwrap '' program ( lovell 2000 ) to analyze the upper and lower limits on our brightness temperature measurements .",
    "this program uses the method described by tzioumis et al .",
    "( 1989 ) in which the parameter of interest is varied in steps around the best - fit value , allowing the other parameters to relax at each step , and the resultant model is then visually compared with the data to determine whether or not the fit remains acceptable .",
    "the brightness temperature of a component depends on the flux density and size of the component , and the size depends on three of the difmap model - fit parameters : the major axis length , the axial ratio , and indirectly on the position angle of the major axis ( since different major axis lengths and axial ratios may be allowed at different position angles ) .",
    "the size error analysis therefore searches a three - dimensional cube in parameter space , varying the major axis length and position angle and the axial ratio over all possible combinations given input search ranges and step sizes .",
    "a visual inspection is done to determine the goodness of the fit instead of using a numerical cutoff in the chi - squared because the true number of degrees of freedom is not well known . using the actual number of measured visibilities ( @xmath46 for these observations ) to determine the degrees of freedom gives errors that are unrealistically small , and",
    "methods used by other authors did not have a clear physical motivation ( e.g. one degree of freedom per antenna per hour [ biretta , moore , & cohen 1986 ] ) .    in table",
    "[ tbtab ] we show our brightness temperature error analysis for the six components in table  [ mfittab ] that have best - fit brightness temperatures over @xmath39  k. for each of these components we searched a @xmath47 cube in major axis length , axial ratio , and major axis position angle .",
    "initially we searched major axis lengths from zero to twice the best - fit length , axial ratios from zero to one , and a range of @xmath48 in position angle ; and then refined the search to a smaller grid if necessary .",
    "the parameter values yielding the maximum and minimum area that still gave an acceptable fit to the data were recorded .",
    "a similar error analysis was done for the flux density , and the extreme allowed values of area and flux density were used to determine the maximum and minimum brightness temperatures . since errors in flux density and size",
    "are searched for separately , the flux density was held constant during the size error analysis and vice - versa .",
    "the position of the component was also held constant to avoid it ` trading identities ' with another model component .",
    "all other model components were allowed to vary .",

    "the measured lower limits also indicate a considerable error in the best - fit brightness temperature values : three of the six components with best - fit brightness temperatures over @xmath39  k have minimum brightness temperatures under this value .",
    "the other three components have minimum brightness temperatures over @xmath39  k , with minimum brightness temperatures of 1.2 , 2.0 , and 4.9  @xmath49  k being measured for components  1 and 2 of the 5  ghz vsop model fit ( the core and first jet component ) and component  4 of the 1.6  ghz vsop model fit ( c4 ) respectively .",
    "bower & backer ( 1998 ) and shen et al .",
    "( 1999 ) report brightness temperatures of @xmath50  k from vsop observations of nrao  530 and pks1921@xmath0293 respectively , but without accompanying error analyses .",
    "if a brightness distribution other than a gaussian is used in the model fitting , the derived values of the brightness temperature will be different .",
    "for example , the brightness temperature of a homogeneous optically thick component is given by @xmath51 where the constant in front is different from that in equation  ( [ tbeq ] ) , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the lengths of the major and minor axes respectively rather than the fwhms .",
    "the visibility of a homogeneous optically thick component drops to 50% at the same baseline length as a gaussian when its diameter equals 1.6 times the gaussian s fwhm ( pearson 1995 ) , so we expect the homogeneous optically thick brightness temperature to be about 0.6 of the gaussian brightness temperature ( see also hirabayashi et al .  1998 and in particular the correction in the erratum to this paper ) .",
    "we have fit homogeneous optically thick components to the data , and for the two components in table  [ tbtab ] where neither component type goes to zero size ( components  2 and 5 of the 5  ghz model fit ) we measure brightness temperatures of 1.9 and 1.5  @xmath49  k respectively for homogeneous optically thick components rather than 2.9 and 2.6  @xmath49  k for gaussian components , so we see about the expected decrease .",
    "since the true brightness distribution is not known , and gaussian components are the standard for vlbi model fitting and provide a somewhat better fit for these observations , we remained with gaussian components .",
    "our highest brightness temperature lower limit of @xmath52  k for component c4 at 1.6  ghz implies doppler factor lower limits of 5 and 50 for the inverse compton and equipartition brightness temperature limits respectively .",
    "a doppler factor of 50 is at the upper end of the doppler factor distributions expected for flux - limited samples of flat - spectrum radio sources ( lister & marscher 1997 ) and gamma - ray sources ( lister 1998 ) .",
    "bower & backer ( 1998 ) found similar values for the doppler factor of nrao  530 under these same two limiting conditions .",
    "if vsop observations reveal a brightness temperature much higher than @xmath5  k , or many brightness temperatures around @xmath5  k , it may be difficult to reconcile the high doppler factors implied by the equipartition brightness temperature limit with beaming statistics and with the relatively slow speeds measured in studies of apparent velocity distributions ( e.g. vermeulen 1995 ) .    using an estimated speed for c4 of 7  @xmath8 ( see @xmath18  [ comps ] ) , and assuming the pattern speed observed with vlbi equals the bulk fluid speed in the jet , bulk lorentz factors and angles to the line - of - sight can be calculated for the jet . for @xmath53 , @xmath54=7.5 and @xmath55=11@xmath30 ; for @xmath56 , @xmath54=25.5 and @xmath55=0.3@xmath30 .",
    "again , the equipartition brightness temperature limit implies values for 3c  279 near the extremes of expected egret source properties ( lister 1998 ) .",
    "3c  279 and nrao  530 have both been detected by egret , and bower & backer ( 1998 ) speculate that blazars detected by egret may be those where the equipartition brightness temperature limit is briefly ( on a timescale of years ) superseded by the inverse compton catastrophe limit .",
    "the observations presented in this paper occurred at the beginning of a total flux density flare at 5 ghz recorded by the michigan monitoring program that would later reach the highest flux density yet recorded in this program for 3c  279 at 5 ghz .",
    "measurements of the variability brightness temperature of this flare ( lhteenmki , valtaoja , & wiik 1999 ) together with vsop brightness temperatures measured during ao2 should allow calculation of the intrinsic brightness temperature and doppler factor and allow us to estimate any departures from equipartition in this source .",
    "we have presented the first space vlbi images of 3c 279 , which are the highest resolution images yet obtained of this source at 5 and 1.6 ghz .",
    "the parsec - scale emission is dominated by the core and the jet component c4 which has been visible in vlbi images since 1985 . the 1.6 ghz vsop image and the 5 and 1.6 ghz",
    "vlba - only images show emission from a jet extending to the southwest .",
    "the 1.6 ghz vlba - only image has structure that matches that seen in the highest resolution vla images , connecting the parsec and kiloparsec scale structures in this source .    we have exploited two of the main strengths of vsop : the ability to obtain matched - resolution images to ground - based images at higher frequencies and the ability to measure high brightness temperatures . the spectral index map constructed from the 1.6 ghz vsop image and the 5 ghz vlba - only image has an unusually inverted spectral index in the core region , approaching the limiting value for synchrotron self - absorption of @xmath57 .",
    "an extensive error analysis conducted on the model - fit brightness temperatures reveals brightness temperature lower limits as high as @xmath5  k. this lower limit is significantly above both the nominal inverse compton and equipartition brightness temperature limits .",
