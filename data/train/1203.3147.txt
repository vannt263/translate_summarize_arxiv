    "authors like alsing and milburn @xcite , or hacyan @xcite concluded that entanglement is invariant under lorentz transformations . accordingly ,",
    "terashima and ueda @xcite showed that , under lorentz transformations , the perfect anti - correlation of a singlet state is recovered if one appropriately corrects the detector s orientation according to the wigner rotation @xcite .",
    "caban and remienlinski also did an interesting study of epr correlations in the quantum field theory context@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , peres _",
    "@xcite considered a single free spin-@xmath0 particle , and literally stated that  the reduced density matrix for its spin is not covariant under lorentz transformation .",
    "the spin entropy is not a relativistic scalar and has no invariant meaning \" .",
    "this later conclusion by peres _",
    "_ @xcite may lead a careless reader to think that a mere change of reference frame could create entanglement .",
    "in quantum information , _ entanglement _ is a resource which allows for the realization of teleportation @xcite , quantum cryptography @xcite , quantum - enhanced global positioning @xcite , just to cite a few impressive possible applications .",
    "though the wigner rotation acts only on the spin degrees of freedom , it is not independent of the momentum , and a lorentz transformation can not be reduced solely to a wigner rotation , without altering the momentum . in the relativistic context , spin and momentum are not independent degrees of freedom .",
    "it is not possible a change of inertial reference frame , which changes the momentum , i.e. a boost , without changing the quantization axis of the spin . among others ,",
    "this was realized by gingrich and adami @xcite , who concluded that  while spin and momentum entanglement separately are not lorentz invariant , the joint entanglement of the wave function is . \" as a matter of fact , it is simple to understand . if we insist in facing spin and momentum as independent degrees of freedom in the relativistic context , which they are not , a change of inertial reference frame is a global linear operation acting on spin and momentum .",
    "even when one chooses a unitary representation for the inhomogeneous lorentz group , and then the wigner rotation comes into play , a lorentz boost acts as a global unitary on spin and momentum , and not as local unitary solely on spin , or solely on momentum .",
    "a way out of this subtleties was proposed by bartlett and terno @xcite in their  relativistic invariant quantum information \" approach .",
    "notwithstanding one can find in the literature calculations showing the variation of spin entanglement solely due to a lorentz transformation @xcite .",
    "the inextricable dependence of spin and momentum , in the relativistic quantum information context , was discussed by czachor and wilzcewski @xcite , who considered the relativistic version of the bennett - brassard @xcite cryptographic scheme . even though , the subject is controversial , as exemplified by czachor s @xcite comment on peres _",
    "work @xcite .",
    "following ideas similar to czachor s , caban and rembieliski @xcite developed a covariant reduced spin density matrix , with the caveat that the momentum dependent lorentz transformations could not be represented unitarily and should act on the dirac spinors rather than on _",
    "spin kets_. czachor recently wrote an extensive study of the covariance of quantum information @xcite , and also concluded that the entanglement does not change under lorentz transformations .",
    "as one can easily realize , the quantum information community is still trying to come to grips with the proper treatment of entanglement in the relativistic context .",
    "the present work is an attempt to guide the newcomer straightforwardly to the conclusion of the covariance of entanglement , using a very simple but yet rigorous formalism .",
    "the main difference of our approach and similar works in the literature is the way we treat the kinematic degrees of freedom .",
    "we explicitly identify the single particle hilbert space as labeled by both spin and momentum , calling attention to the fact that they do not compose by means of a tensor product and , therefore , have no well defined partial trace , in the usual sense , but which does not hinder one to take averages on momentum , as done by caban and rembieliski @xcite .",
    "the other crucial point is that we do not single out any particular spin operator , like pauli - lubanski , rather we obtain the correct basis for spin measurements directly from the form of the operators in the lorentz algebra .",
    "this is illustrated by considering two observers in relative motion , sending particles with well defined momentum to each other and performing spin measurements , a scenario representative of quantum information exchange between an earth station and a satellite @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start by reviewing the dirac equation for a free particle .",
    "we then investigate how the free spin-@xmath0 particle state transforms under an inertial reference frame change . in order to do that",
    ", we use the invariance of the hilbert space internal product @xcite and derive a non - unitary representation of the lorentz group .",
    "our motivation to do this is that the choice of representation does not change the _ physics _ , and thus we can highlight the interdependence of spin and momentum in the lorentz transformation . in the sequence , we verify that the purity ( or mixedness ) of the state is lorentz invariant , and show how the spin quantization axis changes with the momentum .",
    "finally we do some illustrative calculations on how to perform the momentum dependent spin measurements on moving frames , and conclude .",
    "in this section we recall the arguments that lead to the fundamental equation of the relativistic quantum mechanics , the dirac equation @xcite , whose solution is a particle with 4-momentum @xmath1 and spin @xmath2 ( or an antiparticle with 4-momentum @xmath3 ) .",
    "we first write a schrdinger like equation ( natural units are assumed , @xmath4 ) : @xmath5 where the variable @xmath6 is the 4-position in the minkowski space .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath7 is the relativistic energy @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the momentum vector and @xmath10 is the mass in rest frame .",
    "the dirac equation is obtained by imposing linear derivatives on both space and time in eq.1 , which guarantees lorentz covariance ( lorentz invariance of form ) , i.e. the physical content of the equation is the same in all relativistic inertial frames .",
    "therefore , the _ dirac hamiltonian _ has the form : @xmath11 and the dirac equation for a free particle reads : @xmath12 as the dirac hamiltonian should be consistent with the relativistic energy , i.e. @xmath13 , the constants @xmath14 and @xmath15 must satisfy the following relations : @xmath16 the simplest solution to the above relations is @xmath17 traceless unitary hermitian matrices @xcite . thus the dirac equation is a @xmath18 matrix equation .",
    "the solutions of the dirac equation , known as _",
    "spinors _ , have four components , like the 4-vectors in minkowski space , but they do not transform like vectors under lorentz transformations .",
    "the _ spinors _ call for a new representation of the lorentz transformations .",
    "a possible choice for the @xmath14 and @xmath15 matrices , known as weyl or chiral representation ( see for example appendix a.3 in @xcite ) is : @xmath19 where @xmath20 are the pauli matrices and @xmath21 is the @xmath22 identity .",
    "we now define the _ gamma matrices _ , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , such that we have a 4-vector of matrices @xmath25 , i.e. : @xmath26 it is convenient to define the pauli matrix 4-vectors @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "finally , the the dirac equation in covariant form reads : @xmath29    for a free particle with 4-momentum @xmath1 , in a given reference frame , the dirac equation solution is given in the form : @xmath30 substituting this function in the dirac equation , we obtain for the spinors @xmath31 : @xmath32 for a particle in its rest frame , with 4-momentum @xmath33 , eq.[5 ] reduces to : @xmath34 the solutions of eq.12 are of the form : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a normalization factor .",
    "since the dirac equation is a @xmath17 matrix equation , the @xmath37 must be 2-component vectors and form an orthonormal basis in the hilbert space .",
    "therefore we write : @xmath38 these vectors label a new degree of freedom , that we had not taken into account , the particle s spin .",
    "therefore , @xmath39 needs one more label , the spin orientation ( @xmath40 ) : @xmath41 as we are in the particle s rest frame , the chosen basis for the vectors @xmath42 are usually the eigenstates of the @xmath43 pauli matrix , so the spin quantization axis is in @xmath44 direction and we have the spin orientations @xmath45 when @xmath46 and @xmath47 when @xmath48 .",
    "if we now consider a free antiparticle with negative energy , @xmath49 the dirac equation for the spinors @xmath50 reads @xmath51 and the solution in the rest frame is : @xmath52 with @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "in this section , we obtain the representation of the lorentz transformations that act on the spinors .",
    "let @xmath55 and @xmath56 be elements of the lorentz algebra , satisfying the following commutation relation @xcite : @xmath57=i(g^{\\nu\\rho}s^{\\mu\\sigma}-g^{\\mu\\rho}s^{\\nu\\sigma}-g^{\\nu\\sigma}s^{\\mu\\rho}+g^{\\mu\\sigma}s^{\\nu\\rho}).\\ ] ] the metric of minkowski space is @xmath58 , which can be obtained from the anti - commutation relation of the gamma matrices @xmath59 . on the other hand , the @xmath55 can be obtained from the commutation relation of the gamma matrices : @xmath60.\\ ] ] this algebra has six elements , namely three for the boosts ( translations ) , and other three for spin rotations .",
    "@xmath61 is the lorentz boost generator in the direction @xmath62 , while @xmath63 is the angular momentum operator of the spin , responsible for its rotation in the plane @xmath64 .",
    "note that as consequence of the tensorial character of the spin operator @xmath63 @xcite , spin observables intrinsically have tensorial character in the context of relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "now writing explicitly the lorentz operators : @xmath65 we obtain the lorentz group as an exponential function of the lorentz algebra .",
    "if @xmath66 is an element of the group , and @xmath67 is the transformation parameter , we have : @xmath68 the boost representation will be @xmath69 , where @xmath70 , being @xmath71 the rapidity of the particle in direction @xmath72 .",
    "the rapidity can be defined as a function of the relative velocity , @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , we can write the boosts having the rapidity as a parameter of the transformation : @xmath74 . in the case that the particle has a 4-momentum @xmath1 , the rapidity is @xmath75 and @xmath76 , this results in the lorentz boost : @xmath77 note that the boost generator @xmath61 is not hermitian , therefore the implementation of the homogeneous lorentz group is not unitary @xcite .",
    "now we can calculate the spinor with arbitrary 4-momentum @xmath1 , from the spinor in the rest frame , i.e. @xmath78 : @xmath79 alternatively , we can also write : @xmath80 analogously for the spinors @xmath81 ( corresponding to the antiparticle ) , we have : @xmath82    to calculate the normalization constants we need to define the dual of the dirac spinors .",
    "a good choice is @xmath83 the justification of such a choice is that it guarantees the lorentz invariance of the inner product . with @xmath84 and @xmath85",
    ", we obtain for the normalization constants : @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "finally , the dirac spinors in an arbitrary frame can be written as : @xmath88 @xmath89 with these expressions we have a complete and orthonormal basis for the hilbert space of the spinors .",
    "this space is denoted by @xmath90 , which is a direct sum of the hilbert space of the particle ( rest mass @xmath10 , spin @xmath2 and positive energy ) and the hilbert space of its antiparticle ( rest mass @xmath10 , spin @xmath2 , but with negative energy ) @xcite .",
    "the hilbert space labels come from the casimir operators of the lorentz and poincar group , which are @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "therefore the mass and spin are the kinematic labels for the quantum systems @xcite .",
    "the attentive reader certainly noted that the spinors ( eqs.[16 ] and [ 16b ] ) are not tensor products of kets of momentum and spin ( e.g. @xmath93 ) , and it is not possible to transform spin independently of momentum ( eqs.[15 ] , [ 15b ] and [ 7 ] ) , let alone a transformation on a _ reduced spin density matrix _ , which is ill defined in the relativistic context @xcite .",
    "in this section we start discussing general superpositions of spinors , then we introduce mixed states , and investigate covariance properties of expectation values , and finally unify the representation of pure and mixed states in a bloch sphere .",
    "the motivation is to show that a properly defined mixed state should be covariant , which has the important consequence of the invariance of pure states entanglement under lorentz transformations .",
    "this conclusion , though obvious , seems to be still misunderstood in the literature @xcite .",
    "it is important to stress that we are treating a free dirac particle , whose hilbert space is a direct sum of the particle s and antiparticle s sub - spaces , @xmath94",
    ". only cpt transformations ( i.e. , inversion of both charge and parity , and time reversal ) can connect these sub - spaces @xcite , transforming a particle in an antiparticle , and vice - versa . as cpt transformations are not considered in the present context , we can write a pure spin state for a particle with momentum @xmath1 as : @xmath95 with @xmath96 . if eq.[23 ] represents a quantum state , the squared coefficients @xmath97 must correspond to some probability distribution",
    ". we can check if this is so by means of the conservation of the 4-current : @xmath98 @xmath99 is the probability distribution , and @xmath100 is the probability current associated with the spinor @xmath101 , such that @xmath102 .",
    "@xmath101 is a solution of the dirac equation , @xmath103    now the probability distribution @xmath104 can be written in the basis @xmath105 as : @xmath106 and using the inner product relation @xmath107 , we finally arrive at : @xmath108 therefore , as @xmath109 is a positive constant , the coefficients @xmath97 are the @xmath104 probability distribution coefficients .",
    "now we check that though the lorentz boost is not unitary , the normalization of the spinor is invariant under lorentz transformations @xcite .",
    "let the dual of the spinor @xmath110 in the frame @xmath111 be : @xmath112 in other frame @xmath113 , the spinor @xmath114 and its dual @xmath115 are related to frame @xmath111 through the lorentz transformation @xmath116 : @xmath117 the transformation for the spinors is trivial , but it is not so obvious in the case of the duals , for we have to use the inverse lorentz transformation given by @xmath118 the explicit calculation is as follows : @xmath119 finally we have : @xmath120 which implies that the normalization is invariant under lorentz transformations , as expected .",
    "now that we have well defined pure sates , we introduce the mixed states by means of the convex sum @xcite : @xmath121 where @xmath122 are pure states given by eq.[23 ] and @xmath123 represents the probability to obtain the @xmath124 state , such that @xmath125 .",
    "now we shall calculate how these mixed states behave under lorentz transformations .",
    "a state @xmath126 in the frame @xmath113 is written as : @xmath127 invoking the lorentz transformation eq.[21 ] , it is evident that : @xmath128 and therefore @xmath129    now we check that the expectation value of a hermitian operator ( @xmath130 ) is the same in all frames : @xmath131&=&tr[d(\\omega)a(p)d(\\omega)^{-1}d(\\omega)\\rho(p)d(\\omega)^{-1}]\\\\ tr[a'(p')\\rho'(p')]&=&tr[a(p)\\rho(p)].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it follows that the trace and eigenvalues of the density matrix ( @xmath132 ) are covariant . of course , to maintain invariance , we must transform both state and observable .",
    "another important consequence of the covariance of expectation values is the invariance of the purity ( or mixedness ) of the density matrix , i.e. @xmath133=tr[\\rho(p)^{2}].$ ] a corollary of this straightforward result is the invariance of entanglement of pure states under lorentz transformations , for in this case the purity of the marginals characterize the entanglement .",
    "let us write a bloch like decomposition for the density matrix @xcite .",
    "first we define the pauli matrices decomposed in the dirac spinors as : @xmath134,\\\\ \\sigma_{z}(p)&=&u(p,0)\\overline{u}(p,0)-u(p,1)\\overline{u}(p,1).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the matrix @xmath135 is the maximally mixed ( or depolarized ) state , which can be decomposed in the dirac spinors as : @xmath136 @xmath137 also satisfies the relation @xcite : @xmath138    finally we have a continuous manifold , for @xmath139 is continuous , that has a bloch like sphere in each definite momentum @xmath1 : @xmath140 as in the nonrelativistic case , we have pure states for @xmath141 , and mixed states for @xmath142 .",
    "note that to each momentum value there is associated a bloch sphere on spins , such that the spin quantization axis , or the antipodal points on a canonical basis orientation ( like @xmath43 eigenstates ) , depends explicitly on the momentum of the reference frame .",
    "note that we have defined a probability distribution eq.[j0 ] on the spin degrees of freedom , because we assumed a particle with a known definite momentum . in a quantum information context",
    "this is justified because two parties interested in performing some task , a protocol , must share a common reference frame , in order to have a well defined quantization axis .",
    "remember , for instance , that in the quantum teleport protocol @xcite , alice must inform bob the directions she measured spin , in order to bob perform his measurements to recover the quantum information .",
    "in this section we discuss how a spin measurement depends on the particle s momentum under lorentz transformations .",
    "the scenario is a source , in the rest frame @xmath111 on earth , emitting particles with velocity @xmath143 and spin up in the @xmath44 direction , such that @xmath144 an observer at rest in a frame @xmath113 on a satellite , which moves with velocity @xmath145 in relation to @xmath111 , measures the spin of the particles .",
    "our problem is to preview the measurement outcomes in @xmath113 as a function of the detector s orientation .",
    "we start by writing the momentum of the particle in the frame @xmath111 , @xmath146 this momentum is obtained performing a lorentz transformation ( boost in @xmath44 direction ) on a particle at rest ( @xmath33 ) , @xmath147 where @xmath148 being @xmath149 the particle s rapidity ( @xmath150 ) .",
    "the particle s momentum in the satellite ( @xmath151 ) is obtained by means of a boost in the @xmath152 direction on @xmath139 : @xmath153 where @xmath154 being @xmath67 the rapidity of the satellite ( @xmath155 ) .",
    "finally we arrive at @xmath156 , where @xmath157    substituting the momentum @xmath151 in eq.[7 ] , we obtain the particle s spinor in the satellite : @xmath158 performing the matrix products in the above equation results in : @xmath159    in order to define the spin measurement in the satellite , we introduce the following projectors : @xmath160 where @xmath161 the spin measurement in the satellite reveals that , in relation to earth , the quantization axis changes by @xmath162 and the spinor gains a relative phase @xmath163 .",
    "the spin measurement operator has to belong to both the lorentz algebra and the angular momentum lie algebra .",
    "a pair of operators satisfying these restrictions and defining a complete measurement is : @xmath164    [ fig1 ]    ) of the spin quantization axis on the satellite in relation to earth , as a function of the rapidities of the particle ( @xmath149 ) and of the satellite ( @xmath67 ) .",

    ", we see that the quantization axis tends to @xmath170 ( @xmath171 ) , as the particle s velocity tends to zero , as expected . on the other hand , for a particle moving near to the speed of light",
    ", the spin quantization axis tends to @xmath172 .",
    "of course a massive particle never reaches the speed of light , and the plot in fig.1 never touches the @xmath165 axis .",
    "this result is nice , for it is well known that a massless particle always has its spin , or rather its helicity , parallel to the momentum .",
    "it is interesting to note that the lorentz transformation , though not unitary , acts on the spin degree of freedom like a rotation in the quantization axis .",
    "this rotation is like a little group representation of the poincar ( inhomogeneous ) group , and belongs to @xmath173 @xcite .",
    "therefore , as entanglement is invariant under local unitaries , we conclude that the _ entanglement _ of a system under lorentz transformation can not change , what changes is just the spin quantization axis as a function of momentum , as we see in fig.1 .",
    "we could analyze a simpler situation where the particle is at rest , with spin up , and it is to be measured by a moving observer with rapidity @xmath67 . this observer sees the spin quantization axis rotate according to ( fig.2 ) : @xmath174 this result is just an evidence that what really matters for the _ relativity principle _ is the _ relative movement_.

    "in order to discuss quantum information in the relativistic context , one has first to properly describe one - particle states under lorentz transformations , and that was what we did . after revising the dirac equation for a free particle",
    ", we obtained the covariance of expectation values , which implies the covariance of the eigenvalues of the spinor density matrix .",
    "the covariance of the eigenvalues also implies the covariance of the purity of the density matrix .",
    "it follows then that entanglement of a bipartite pure state is covariant , for it can be characterized by the purity of the marginal density matrix .",
    "we saw that what changes in a spin-@xmath0 particle under lorentz transformations is the spin quantization axis as a function of the momentum .",
    "the lorentz transformation acts on the spin degree of freedom as a local rotation , and this is another way to understand why the entanglement does not change . as a matter of fact ,",
    "from the point of view of lorentz transformations , spin and momentum are not independent degrees of freedom , but just labels of the hilbert space .",
    "finally , in fig.1 and fig.2 , we illustrated how the detectors should be aligned , depending on the momentum , for a proper spin measurement .",
    "note that if the observer in the moving frame ignores his momentum in relation to earth , and therefore can not calculate the proper alignment of his detectors according to the lorentz transformation , this is just _ classical ignorance _ and can not induce any quantum effect .",
