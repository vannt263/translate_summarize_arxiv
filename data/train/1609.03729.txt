    "sensing and imaging are key applications of the study of light propagation in strongly scattering media  @xcite .",
    "optical coherence tomography  @xcite is one of the most emblematic example but is limited to small optical thicknesses where the single scattering regime takes place .",
    "because of multiply scattered light , sensing and imaging deeply inside a strongly disordered system is very challenging and has been a matter of intense study in the last two decades .",
    "important breakthroughs were achieved recently by `` learning '' the system using wavefront shaping techniques  @xcite , by using multimodal approaches such acousto - optics  @xcite , or by taking advantage of particular features of light scattering in complex environments such as the memory effect  @xcite , to cite a few examples .",
    "another possibility consists in using fluorescent emitters embedded inside the scattering medium .",
    "it is well known that the spontaneous decay rate @xmath1 of such an emitter strongly depends on the local environment  @xcite .",
    "more precisely , this decay rate is proportional to the local density of states @xmath2 ( ldos ) at the position of the emitter  @xcite .",
    "this makes this quantity strongly non - universal which is of great interest in terms of imaging  @xcite , sensing  @xcite and control  @xcite . by performing statistics , signatures of the local order around the emitter  @xcite and of transport regimes  @xcite",
    "are revealed .",
    "interestingly , the fluctuations of the ldos are encoded in the spatial intensity correlation function ( speckle correlation ) measured outside the medium  .",
    "more precisely , ldos fluctuations generate an infinite - range contribution to the speckle correlation function denoted by @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "this contribution is a feature of speckle patterns produced by a point source ( e.g.a fluorescent emitter ) located inside the medium .",
    "measuring @xmath3 amounts to measuring ldos fluctuations . in the optical regime , this can be achieved by measuring fluctuations of the spontaneous decay rate of fluorescent emitters  @xcite . in acoustics , direct measurements of @xmath3 from speckle correlations have been reported  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce and study a new type of spatial correlation function , denoted @xmath0 , and defined as the correlation function of the spontaneous decay rate of a single emitter measured at two different positions inside the disordered medium .",
    "as will be shown , this correlation function generalizes the usual @xmath3 contribution .",
    "we demonstrate that the amplitude and the width of @xmath0 provide decoupled information on the structural correlation of the disordered medium and on the local environment of the emitter , which makes this correlation function particularly interesting for sensing and imaging in complex media .",
    "the normalized correlation function of the intensity measured in the far - field is defined as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the intensity in direction @xmath6 and @xmath7 denotes an average over all possible configurations of disorder .",
    "this correlation function is usually splitted into three components  @xcite @xmath8 the @xmath9 term is usually the predominant short - range term and gives typically the size of the speckle spot . @xmath10 and @xmath11 are long - range terms with smaller amplitudes . when the speckle pattern is produced by a point source embedded inside the scattering medium , an additionnal term of infinite - range exists , and is denoted by @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 contribution to the correlation function is related to the normalized fluctuations of the ldos @xmath12  @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the position of the emitter . for a fluorescent emitter in the weak - coupling regime ,",
    "the spontaneous decay rate @xmath15 is proportionnal to the ldos  @xcite , and @xmath3 can be rewritten as @xmath16 several studies of ldos fluctuations in disordered media , or equivalently of @xmath3 , have been reported  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that @xmath3 originates from near - field interactions with the nearby scatterers , providing a non - universal behavior that is particularly relevant for sensing and imaging  @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath3 is also expected to be influenced by structural correlations in the disorder  @xcite . in this article , we show that the new correlation @xmath17 carries enough information to extract signatures of both the near - field interactions and the structural correlations , thus providing a potentially useful extension of the usual @xmath3 correlation function .",
