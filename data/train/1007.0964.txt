    "working to order @xmath5 , there are two @xmath6 and eight @xmath5 operators in the expansion of the mass operator of the nonstrange @xmath1 excited baryons @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will be concerned with the observed pattern of the coefficients of the various operators in the @xmath0 expansion when applied to the study of these negative parity excited states .    the most prominent feature of the coefficients @xmath7 is the dominance of the @xmath8 operator @xmath9 , which is also confirmed by extending the analysis to flavor @xmath10 , including all the members of the * 70 * -plet @xcite @xcite .",
    "the coefficients of the @xmath6 and of the other @xmath5 operators are smaller than expected by @xmath0 power counting alone , as their natural size is set by the coefficient of the unit operator and is of the order of @xmath11 mev .",

    "@xcite by assuming dominance of a pion - mediated interaction among constituent quarks .    in this paper",
    "we propose another explanation for this hierarchy of the coefficients : the short range of the quark interaction in the constituent quark model .",
    "we show that in the limit of a contact interaction any scalar quark interaction , regardless of its spin - flavor structure , is matched onto the single operator @xmath4 .",
    "this implies the surprising conclusion that , within the scalar interactions , it is impossible to distinguish between quark interactions with different spin - flavor structures , such as the one - gluon exchange model ( oge ) @xcite @xcite and the goldstone boson exchange model ( gbe ) @xcite , as long as these interactions are of very short range .    on the other hand , a more complex spatial dependence of the quark forces will introduce two other operators @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "their strengths depend on the range of the interaction @xcite and are sensitive to the spin - flavor structure . modeling the quark interaction as mediated by the exchange of a meson of mass @xmath14 we discuss the consequences of a finite range given by @xmath15 and propose the sign of the ratio of two coefficients as a test for the spin - flavor structure of the interaction .",
    "we finally use the wave functions of the isgur - karl model @xcite with a harmonic oscillator potential to compute this ratio and constrain the mass scale @xmath14 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ zeror ] we discuss the matching of the three possible spin - flavor structures to the effective operator expansion and point out that in the case of a zero range interaction only one operator dominates . in sec .",

    "[ concl ] we summarize and present our conclusions .",
    ".the projection of the most general scalar quark interaction onto irreducible representations of @xmath16 allows to express the corresponding reduced matrix elements as matrix elements of the operators listed in the second and third column .",
    "they are shown again in the last column written in terms of @xmath17 defined in the text , up to terms proportional to the unit operator .",

    "its very small value ( see solid line in fig .  [",
    "fig : ratioc12 ] ) can not be explained by power counting in @xmath0 and must have a dynamical origin .",
    "we find that it is suppressed for pion exchange interactions in general ( chiral limit or physical pion mass ) , as @xmath21 from the spin - flavor structure alone . in the case of gluon exchange interactions ,",
    "its smallness is related to the spatial extent of the interaction ( and not related to its spin - flavor structure as in the previous case ) . in the case of a contact spin - spin interaction @xmath21 and",
    "the ratio vanishes , but otherwise this ratio is different from zero .",
    "we comment on the argument presented in ref .",
    "@xcite for the dominance of the operator @xmath4 in the mass operator , and compare it with our conclusions . as mentioned in the introduction , in this paper it was argued that the dominance of the @xmath4 operator follows by assuming one pion exchange .",
    "this follows from the observation that one particular linear combination of operators is equivalent to the unit operator ( taking its matrix element on the nonstrange states ) , up to corrections of @xmath8 @xmath22 this identity allows one to eliminate one of the three scalar operators . choosing to eliminate @xmath23 ,",
    "the scalar part of the mass operator reads @xmath24 for the pion exchange interaction ( both contact and finite range ) we find @xmath25 , which confirms the result of ref .",
    "@xcite of dominance of @xmath4 in the large @xmath26 limit . in our approach , at @xmath27 , the dominance of @xmath4 is exact for pion exchange or any contact interaction .    using the numerical values of the coefficients @xmath28 from eq .",
    "( [ exp ] ) , the value of the ratio is @xmath29 an alternative determination using only hadron masses is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : ratioc12 ] .",
    "the solid line is the preferred solution @xcite and gives a range of values compatible with the first determination ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratioc12 ] as the black point with error bars ) .",
    "the central value is positive and clearly suppressed with respect to its natural size @xmath6 for any value of the mixing angle @xmath30 .",
    "its sign favors a pure vector boson exchange model oge@xmath31 with a non - vanishing vector meson mass @xmath14 .",
    "however , within the errors , negative values or a vanishing ratio are also allowed , such that it is difficult to draw a clear conclusion . a more precise determination of the mixing angles and hadron masses may sharpen this determination and allow one to fix the sign of the ratio .",
    "we comment briefly on the massive vector boson exchange model oge@xmath31 , which produces a positive ratio @xmath20 .",
    "this corresponds to a massive gluon model , previously considered in the literature in refs .",
    "@xcite . in these works",
    "it has been suggested that , in the low energy limit , an effective gluon mass can be generated by nonperturbative qcd effects . in principle an effective gluon mass can be observed through its effect on the low energy limit of quark forces in the constituent quark model . in the next section",
    "we perform a crude model calculation to give an estimate of the range of allowed values for the effective gluon mass @xmath14 .",
    "the analysis presented above was limited to the spin - flavor structure of the scalar quark interaction . in the spin - orbit sector , it has been pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that the flavor dependent interactions @xmath32 are needed in order to reproduce the observed mass spectrum .",
    "also in the tensor sector , flavor dependent operators are needed @xcite in order to produce a non - zero coefficient of the operator @xmath33 . allowing for a mixture of all possible interactions @xmath34 with strengths @xmath35 @xmath36 we get the following general results for the operator coefficients @xmath37 \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] no simple conclusions about the relative contributions of the different spin - flavor interactions can be drawn in the most general case .",
    "for example , assuming a mixture of the oge and gbe @xmath38 interactions ( @xmath39 ) , it is possible to arrange positive values for @xmath40 by taking @xmath41 and @xmath42 sufficiently large relative to @xmath43 that the second term in @xmath40 dominates over the third one .",
    "it is interesting to notice that in the case of the simultaneous presence of a massless one gluon exchange interaction ( @xmath44 ) and a finite range one pion exchange interaction the coefficient @xmath45 vanishes independently of their relative strengths .",
    "the finite range effects can be taken into account in a quantitative way by adopting a specific choice for the hadronic model .",
    "for illustration we consider the isgur - karl ( ik ) model @xcite , which has been widely used for describing the properties of the excited baryons .",
    "the matching of this model to the effective operator expansion has also been discussed in detail recently in ref .",
