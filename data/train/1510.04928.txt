    "the frustration effect on the ground - state properties of low - dimensional quantum spin systems with competing interactions has long been a subject of active research . according to a significant amount of theoretical and experimental effort which has been devoted so far ,",
    "it is now widely known that an interplay between two phenomena of great interest , frustration and quantum fluctuation , leads to various exotic ground states .",
    "a typical and long - established example of these ground states is the dimer state accompanying spontaneous translational symmetry breaking in an zigzag chain in which antiferromagnetic nearest - neighbor ( nn ) and next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) interactions are competing with each other  @xcite .",
    "the effect of the frustration on the ground - state properties of an two - leg ladder system has been extensively studied in the cases where additional leg nnn and/or diagonal interactions are competing with the leg nn and rung interactions  @xcite . in the present paper , as another example of the frustrated two - leg ladder systems , we discuss the case where the rung interactions are alternating  @xcite and aim at exploring its ground - state phase diagram .",
    "we express the hamiltonian describing this system in the following form : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the operator acting at the ( @xmath3,@xmath4 ) site assigned by rung @xmath3 and leg @xmath5 ; @xmath6 denotes the magnitude of the isotropic leg interaction ; @xmath7 and @xmath0 denote those of the two kinds of anisotropic rung interactions which are alternating , the @xmath8-type anisotropy being controlled by the parameter @xmath9 in common with both interactions ; @xmath10 is the total number of spins in each leg , which is assumed to be even .",
    "it is emphasized that this system has a frustration when irrespective of the sign of @xmath6 .    in the following discussions ,",
    "we confine ourselves to the case where @xmath7 is ferromagnetic , and we put , choosing @xmath11 as the unit of energy .",
    "we also consider , for simplicity , only the case where , and , that is , we assume that @xmath6 is antiferromagnetic and relatively weak , and that the anisotropy of the rung interactions is of the ising - type . determining the ground - state phase diagram on the @xmath9 versus @xmath0 plane , we mainly employ the numerical methods such as the exact - diagonalization ( ed ) method and the density - matrix renormalization - group ( dmrg ) method  @xcite with the help of physical considerations as well as already - known results for some special cases .",
    "we discuss here some special cases for which the ground states have already been clarified or for which they are reasonably anticipated by physical considerations .      in this case where , by the use of the degenerate perturbation theory , the present system can be mapped onto the chain in the following way .",
    "the eigenstates of an isolated @xmath7- or @xmath0-rung are given by @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 denotes the state and @xmath17 the state .",
    "the corresponding energies are , respectively , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , for all @xmath3 s .",
    "then , it is easy to see that when @xmath9 is sufficiently large , the state @xmath22 can be neglected .",
    "we introduce the pseudo operator @xmath23 for rung @xmath3 , and make the @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 states correspond to @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "the relation @xmath30 holds , as is readily shown by comparing the matrix elements of both operators @xmath23 and @xmath31 with respect to @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) for the operator @xmath31 can be mapped onto the effective hamiltonian @xmath32 for the operator @xmath23 , which is given by @xmath33 where the on - site anisotropy ( @xmath34- ) term comes from the difference between @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "it has already been clarified by chen _ et _",
    "@xcite that in the chain governed by the effective hamiltonian  ( [ eq : effective ] ) , the phase transition from the nel to the haldane state takes place at as @xmath34 increases .",
    "this suggests that in the present ladder , the ground state is the antiferromagnetic stripe nel ( afstn ) state , sketched in the left of figure  [ fig : phases ] , or the haldane state , sketched in the middle of figure  [ fig : phases ] , depending upon whether or with .",
    "( it is noted that the nel state in the chain corresponds to the afstn state in the ladder . )      in this case , the procedure discussed in the previous subsection can be applied to the @xmath7-rung only .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) can be mapped onto an anisotropic ` -` diamond chain .",
    "hida and takano  @xcite have studied the ground state of this chain . by using their results",
    ", we may conclude that , when , the ground state in this case is the haldane state if .      in this case",
    "where , the lowest - energy state of an isolated @xmath0-rung is the singlet dimer state @xmath37 , while that of the ferromagnetic @xmath7-rung is one of the ferromagnetic states @xmath38 and @xmath39 . the effective interaction between the neighboring @xmath7-rungs through the in - between @xmath0-rung can be obtained by carrying out a third - order perturbation calculation . the resulting effective interaction is considered to be antiferromagnetic judging from the numerical result discussed below ( see the right of figure  [ fig : mj135 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the @xmath7-rung in the @xmath38 ( or @xmath39 ) state and that in the @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) state arrange alternatively .",
    "thus , the ground state in the present case is anticipated to be the ` ferromagnetic-`singlet dimer ( f - sd ) state sketched in the right of figure  [ fig : phases ] .",
    "we denote , respectively , by @xmath42 and @xmath43 , the lowest and second - lowest energy eigenvalues of the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) under periodic boundary conditions within the subspace characterized by @xmath10 and the total magnetization .",
    "it is noted that @xmath44 always gives the ground - state energy for the finite-@xmath10 system .",
    "then , the excitation energy gap @xmath45 within the @xmath46 subspace is given by @xmath47 we also define the site magnetization @xmath48 as @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes the ground - state expectation value for the system with @xmath10 rungs . figure  [ fig : phase - diagram ] shows our final result for the ground - state phase diagram on the @xmath9 versus @xmath0 plane .",
    "it consists of the f - sd , haldane and afstn phases .",
    "the solid lines are the 2d ising phase boundary line between the f - sd and haldane phases and that between the haldane and afstn phases . on the other hand , the dotted lines , which are often called the lifshitz lines , separate the commensurate and incommensurate regions ; the latter region is between them .",
    "the most striking feature of this phase diagram is the fact that an incommensurate region appears within the haldane phase region , which can be attributed to the frustration effect .",
    "the fact that the haldane state appears as the ground state even at the limit is also interesting .",
    "this is because the haldane state is known to become the ground state mainly in the case of the @xmath51-type anisotropy in the @xmath8 chain  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is called the inversion phenomenon concerning the interaction anisotropy  @xcite .",
    "let us turn to a discussion on the determination of the phase diagram . in figure",
    "[ fig : gap00 ] we plot the @xmath0-dependence of the excitation energy gap @xmath45 for , calculated by the ed method .",
    "this figure demonstrates that the ground state is doubly degenerate when and when , while it is unique when . from these results together with the physical considerations discussed in section  2",
    ", we may expect that , when , and , the ground states are , respectively , the afstn , haldane and f - sd states . in order to ascertain these expectations",
    ", we have performed dmrg calculations for the finite - size system with spins under open boundary conditions to evaluate the site magnetization @xmath52 for various values of @xmath0  @xcite . as examples ,",
    "the results for the cases of , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are depicted in figure  [ fig : mj135 ] .",
    "we see from this figure that in all cases @xmath55 and @xmath56 are almost equal to each other . in the first case , , which shows that the ground state in this case is the afstn state . in the second case ,",
    "the edge states clearly exist ; this is one of the most representative features of the haldane state  @xcite . finally in the third case , and , which show that the ground state is the f - sd state .    both of the phase transition between the afstn and haldane states and that between the haldane and f - sd states are of the 2d ising type , since the @xmath57 symmetry is broken in the afstn and f - sd states while it is not broken in the haldane state",
    "it is well known that the phenomenological renormalization group ( prg ) method  @xcite is a useful one to determine the phase boundary line for this phase transition .",
    "the prg equations for the ( afstn , haldane)-transition and for the ( haldane , f - sd)-transition are , respectively , given by @xmath58 this is because the periods along each leg are @xmath59 and @xmath60 in the afstn and f - sd states , respectively .",
    "solving numerically these prg equations for a given value of @xmath9 ( or @xmath0 ) , we have computed the finite - size ( afstn , haldane)-transition point @xmath61 @xmath62 for , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and the finite - size ( haldane , f - sd)-transition point  @xmath66 @xmath67 for , @xmath63 , @xmath65 .",
    "we have extrapolated these finite - size data to the thermodynamic ( ) limit by fitting them for the former and for the latter to quadratic functions of @xmath68 and of @xmath69 , respectively .",
    "some examples of the results are and for , and also for .",
    "it is noted that the above value of @xmath70 for is in fairly good agreement with the corresponding value @xmath71 obtained by mapping the present hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) onto the effective hamiltonian  ( [ eq : effective ] ) for the chain ( see subsection  2.1 ) .",
    "we have carried out the same procedure for various values of @xmath9 and @xmath0 to obtain the 2d ising phase boundary lines shown by the solid lines in figure  [ fig : phase - diagram ] .    the lifshitz line which separates the commensurate and incommensurate regions",
    "can be estimated by examining the fourier transform of the site magnetization @xmath48  @xcite .",
    "when we adopt open boundary conditions , the present rung - alternating ladder system has no inversion symmetry with respect to its center position , that is , .",
    "therefore , it is important , especially in the region of the haldane phase , to discuss two kinds of the fourier transforms , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , defined by @xmath74 with , in order to avoid the mismatch of the edge states of both edges . in the above equations @xmath75 is the wave number .    in figure",
    "[ fig : sq - curve ] the @xmath75-dependences of the squared modulus of @xmath76 , which have been calculated by using the dmrg results for @xmath77 for the finite - size system with spins , are shown for the cases of , @xmath53 , @xmath78 and @xmath54 .",
    "it is noted that the @xmath75-dependences of @xmath79 show almost the same behavior .",
    "thus , the values @xmath80 and @xmath81 of @xmath75 which give , respectively , the maximum values of @xmath82 and @xmath83 are almost equal to each other . figure  [ fig : q0-curve ] depicts the plots versus @xmath0 of @xmath80 and @xmath81 for @xmath84 . from this figure",
    "we clearly see that , there are two lifshitz points @xmath85 and @xmath86 , and in the region of , the system has the incommensurate character in the sense that both of @xmath80 and @xmath81 are larger than @xmath87 and smaller than @xmath88 , where and .",
    "these values of the lifshitz points yield good approximations for the corresponding ones , since our calculations show that the finite - size values for , @xmath89 and @xmath90 agree with each other within numerical errors .",
    "we have performed the same procedure for various values of @xmath9 , and obtained the lifshitz lines shown by the dotted lines in figure  [ fig : phase - diagram ] .",
    "it is noted that , in the region between these two lifshitz lines , the ground state of the present system has an incommensurate character .",
    "we have numerically determined , with the help of some physical considerations , the ground - state phase diagram of an anisotropic rung - alternating ladder , which is described by the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) , in the case where , , and . the obtained phase diagram on the @xmath9 versus @xmath0 plane",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig : phase - diagram ] .",
    "we would like to express our sincere thanks to professors u schollwck , t vekua , k hida and j richter for their invaluable discussions and comments .",
    "we also thank the supercomputer center , institute for solid state physics , university of tokyo and the computer room , yukawa institute for theoretical physics , kyoto university for computational facilities .",
    "finally , t.h .  acknowledges the support by jsps kakenhi grant nunmber 15k05198 .",
    "9                                  we note that , fundamentally speaking , the site magnetization @xmath48 must be zero in the ground state of the finite-@xmath10 system .",
    "however , when the ground states are degenerate ( or the energy gap is exponentially small ) , the dmrg calculation for a finite system often selects one of them : in our calculation for the @xmath91 subspace , we have obtained one of the magnetic ordered states in the f - sd and afstn phases and one of the ground states in which free effective spins at open edges are polarized in opposite directions in the haldane phase ."
