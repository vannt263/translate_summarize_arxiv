    "the born rule , being one of the basic principles of quantum physics , establishes a link between a solution of wave equation and the results of observations .",
    "the born rule was proposed in 1926 on the grounds that it complies with the conservation of the number of particles in scattering process @xcite .",
    "later , the born rule was supplemented by the von  neumann projection postulate @xcite to describe the results of repeated measurements .    from the beginning ,",
    "the born rule was perceived as an axiom independent of the equations of motion .",
    "there were numerous attempts to derive the born rule from the basic quantum principles .",
    "for example , a derivation of the born rule was discussed in @xcite and later in @xcite within the many - worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics . however",
    ", this approach was criticized in  @xcite .",
    "the born rule was obtained in @xcite within the concept of hidden measurements , which , however , is not a widely accepted interpretation of quantum mechanics . recently",
    ", the born rule was derived in @xcite from the unitarity of quantum evolution and an additional axiom of probability conservation .    in this paper ,",
    "the born rule is derived from the basic quantum principles , the time - reversal symmetry and linearity of quantum equations of motion .",
    "the derivation presented here is based on the following premises :    \\(a ) the state of a particle is completely determined by its wave function ( wf ) , which is a solution of quantum equation of motion , for example , the schroedinger equation ;    \\(b ) it follows from the above principle that the probability density @xmath0 for a particle to be in some area of space is determined only by the wave function @xmath1 in this area @xmath2 .",
    "our purpose is to find function @xmath3 .",
    "probability @xmath3 is assumed to be a universal function that is applicable to any state of quantum particle described by the  wf .",
    "therefore , it will be sufficient to find @xmath3 in some simple special case , for example , in the case of a plane wave , while the solution found in this special case , due to its universality , is sure to be valid for an arbitrary  wf . by probability of finding a particle in a plane wave , we mean the probability that the particle is in a unit volume , which is essentially the probability density .",
    "consider a plane wave with complex amplitude  @xmath4 : @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are proportional , respectively , to particle momentum and energy @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "let a plane wave be incident on a potential barrier characterized by complex reflectance @xmath10 and transmittance  @xmath11 ( labeling transmittance and time by the same symbol is traditional and may cause no confusion . )",
    "then the reflected wave and transmitted wave ( fig .",
    "[ fig : barrier]a ) will have complex amplitudes , respectively , @xmath12    it is well known @xcite that the schroedinger equation is symmetric with respect to time reversal if , along with the substitution @xmath13 , the wf is changed to its complex conjugate ( see appendix  a for a simple explanation ) .",
    "let the simultaneous action of time reversal and complex conjugation be denoted as  @xmath14 , i.e. @xmath15 .",
    "this operation yields a time - reversed state of quantum particle . in general case",
    ", such time - reversibility of the wf should be regarded as a formal mathematical property of quantum equations of motion . that property does not imply that any state of quantum particle can actually be reversed in an experiment .",
    "direct ( a ) and reverse ( b ) processes of particle interaction with the barrier .",
    "complex amplitudes @xmath16 of reflected wave and @xmath17 of transmitted wave become complex conjugates @xmath18 and @xmath19 under time reversal ( see explanation in the text.),width=321 ]    thus , reversing quantum state gives @xmath20    now let us reverse the process of interaction of a particle with the barrier ( fig .",
    "[ fig : barrier]b ) .",
    "two waves @xmath16 and  @xmath17 that were departing from the barrier now will go back to the barrier and their complex amplitudes will turn into conjugate amplitudes @xmath18 and @xmath19 respectively . assuming the transmittance and reflectance of the potential barrier being the same in either direction ( that is certainly true for a symmetrical barrier ) , one obtains the amplitude of the wave reflected to the left as @xmath21 and transmitted to the left as  @xmath22 .",
    "when time is reversed , a wave of amplitude  @xmath23 should appear running away from the barrier ( fig .",
    "[ fig : barrier]b . )",
    "it follows from the linearity of quantum equations of motion that the superposition principle holds for the  wf . this conclusion applies to both direct and time - reversed processes .",
    "therefore , the reversed state @xmath23 is the result of superposition of two waves running to the left from the barrier , namely , the reflected wave @xmath21 and transmitted wave  @xmath22 : @xmath24 all exponential factors @xmath25 cancel in this equation .",
    "multiplying by @xmath4 and taking into account one obtains @xmath26 which is an inevitable consequence of time - reversibility of quantum equations and the superposition principle .      a particle falling on the barrier is _ indivisible _ , so that it can be found with probability @xmath27 in the reflected beam or with probability @xmath28 in the transmitted beam ( fig .",
    "[ fig : barrier]a ) . as these events are mutually exclusive ( i.e.",
    "a particle can not be found both in the reflected and transmitted beams ) the probabilities should obey @xmath29    the probability must be a real number , therefore , with no loss of generality one may assume that @xmath27 is some function of argument  @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is complex conjugation .",
    "in other words , @xmath32 such a designation is justified , because it imposes no additional restrictions on the unknown function  @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , equation ( [ eq : p(s ) ] ) can be written as @xmath34 according to assumption ( b ) , the probability can be a function of wf only , which is implied by equation  .",
    "due to equation can be written as @xmath35 that is a functional equation with respect to the unknown function  @xmath33 .",
    "equation can be presented in the usual form : @xmath36 where @xmath30 , @xmath37 .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath38 and @xmath39 are independent variables because the height of the barrier ( and its transparency ) can be altered independently of amplitude @xmath4 of the incident wave .",
    "therefore , the only solution to functional equation is a linear function @xmath40 which in view of yields @xmath41 constant @xmath6 is actually a normalization factor that defines the wf unit of measurement . in each quantum problem",
    "this normalization factor is chosen based on convenience .",
    "for example , in the problem considered here , it is convenient to admit that the unit amplitude @xmath42 should correspond to probability @xmath43 , from which one obtains  @xmath44 . therefore , yields the born rule @xmath45 i.e. the sought - for relationship between the probability density and the  wf .    thus , the born rule is obtained as a consequence of time - reversal symmetry of quantum equations of motion .",
    "in addition to this symmetry , an important role in the present derivation is played by the superposition principle ( equation ) , which follows from the equations of motion , and by the assumption about the existence of indivisible particles ( equation ) , which does _ not _ follow from the equations of motion .      according to statement ( b ) , probability density @xmath3 depends only on  @xmath1 .",
    "for this reason , the born rule derived above is a universal function applicable to any state of quantum particle that can be described by a  wf .",
    "it would be desirable , however , to ascertain that the above statement holds for an arbitrary wave packet .",
    "the simplest wave packet is a wave train that may be obtained by taking a part of plane wave of length @xmath46 so that within the @xmath46 interval the wf coincides with the plane wave while outside of the @xmath46 interval the wf is zero .",
    "it is obvious that the above derivation of the born rule holds for points inside the @xmath46 interval .",
    "certainly , such a wave train will spread and change its form with time , however , that will not affect the derivation of the born rule .    indeed , for an arbitrary wave packet , complex amplitude @xmath4 in equation will become a function of coordinates and time  @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , probability density @xmath3 in a wave packet also becomes a function of coordinates and time .",
    "for this reason , the probabilities in eq .   and amplitudes in equations - should be taken at the same space - time point .",
    "let the potential barrier be thin , for example , let its width be much less than the distance of substantial change in  @xmath48",
    ". then it would be convenient to take the amplitudes and probability densities at the same point in an infinitely thin layer at the surface of the potential barrier . in this case",
    "all the results of the previous section will remain valid with the reservation that the born rule will refer to the chosen point on the potential barrier surface .",
    "this , however , may impose no limitation to the applicability of the born rule because both the potential barrier position and time are chosen arbitrarily .",
    "if equation is integrated over the whole space ( in fact , over the volumes of three wave packets found therein ) then the quantum state norm conservation is obtained in the case of interaction of a particle with a potential barrier . in other words ,",
    "time - reversibility and linearity of quantum equations may yield unitarity of solutions of these equations .",
    "the converse is not true ",
    "reversibility can not be obtained from unitarity because reversibility is a point property of the wf , while the unitarity is its integral feature . in this sense ,",
    "the reversibility is a more powerful property than unitary .",
    "perhaps , for this reason , it is easier to obtain the born rule from time - reversibility than from unitary .",
    "in contrast to the schroedinger equation , the relativistic klein - gordon equation contains the energy operator squared .",
    "therefore , time reversal does not change the klein - gordon equation .",
    "for this reason , under time reversal , the klein - gordon equation does not require transition to conjugate states ( according to the logic set out in appendix  a ) .",
    "the born rule , therefore , may be applicable to some particular solutions of the klein - gordon equation but it should be inapplicable to the general solution of this equation .",
    "the born rule is derived in this work from fundamental quantum principles : time - reversal symmetry and linearity of quantum equations of motion . to obtain the born rule it is also necessary to admit the existence of discrete quantum particles , which is not a consequence of quantum equations of motion .",
    "it should be noted that if the klein - gordon equation is taken as the equation of motion in the above derivation then time - reversal  @xmath13 will not change the equation and , therefore , it will not require complex conjugation of the  wf .",
    "for this reason , the born rule should be inapplicable to some solutions of the klein - gordon equation .",
    "the author is thankful to g.b .",
    "lesovik from the landau institute of theoretical physics , chernogolovka , and yu.m .",
    "belousov from the moscow institute of physics and technology for helpful discussions .",
    "let us consider the schroedinger equation for an arbitrary state vector @xmath49 : @xmath50 where @xmath51 - is the energy operator , @xmath52 - is time - independent hamiltonian",
    ".    upon substituting @xmath13 in one obtains @xmath53 where @xmath54 .",
    "equation does not coincide with the schroedinger equation due to the minus sign on its left side . in order to return to the correct equation while retaining time - reversal",
    ", it is necessary to switch from to the conjugate equation : @xmath55 where it is taken into account that the energy operator is anti - hermitian @xmath56 while the hamiltonian is a hermitian operator @xmath57 .",
    "thus , time reversal of a quantum state results in simultaneous replacement of each ket @xmath49 with corresponding bra  @xmath58 .",
