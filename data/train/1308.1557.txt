    "recently there has been a resurgence in attempts to model the dispersion interaction between low - dimensional nano - scale objects more accurately . using an array of electronic structure @xcite and analytical @xcite techniques ,",
    "several groups have demonstrated that the dispersion interaction between one- and two - dimensional systems can deviate strongly from that expected from the well - known _ additive _ picture of @xmath8-type interactions @xcite .",
    "for the case of parallel one - dimensional ( 1d ) metallic wires separated by distance @xmath1 , dobson _",
    "et al._@xcite demonstrated that the van der waals dispersion interaction should decay as @xmath9^{-3/2}$ ] , where @xmath10 is a constant that depends on the wire width .",
    "this analytic result was subsequently verified by drummond and needs @xcite using diffusion quantum monte carlo ( dmc ) calculations @xcite .",
    "this change in the power - law of the dispersion energy can be understood as arising from correlations in extended plasmon modes in the metallic wires @xcite .",
    "these plasmon modes would be expected in any low - dimensional system with a delocalized electron density .",
    "misquitta _ et al._@xcite have recently extended these results to the more general case of finite- and infinite - length wires with arbitrary band gap .",
    "using dispersion models that include non - local charge - flow polarizabilities they were able to describe the dispersion interactions in all cases , including the insulating and semi - metallic wires .",
    "in these models the plasmon - like fluctuations are modelled by the charge - flow polarizabilities which , at lowest order , result in a @xmath11 dispersion interaction @xcite . for metallic wires",
    "these terms are dominant at all separations and yield the result of dobson _",
    "et al._for the dispersion .",
    "curiously , many of these results were known as early as 1952 . using a tight - binding hckel - type model for linear polyenes , coulson and",
    "davies @xcite investigated the dispersion interactions between the chains in a variety of configurations and with a range of highest occupied to lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( homo  lumo ) gaps .",
    "their conclusions about the non - additivity of the dispersion interaction and the changes in power law ( deviations from the expected effective @xmath12 london behaviour ) are essentially identical to those reached by misquitta _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "a few years later longuet - higgins and salem @xcite reached similar conclusions and related the non - additivity of the dispersion to the existence of long - range correlations within the system . a decade later chang _",
    "et al._@xcite used lifshitz theory to derive an analytic form of the dispersion interaction between two metallic wires that is identical to the expression of dobson _ et al._@xcite , though the latter considered many more cases .",
    "the current interest in this field stems from two sources .",
    "first we have recently witnessed an explosion of work on nano - scale devices confined in one or two dimensions .",
    "examples are carbon nanotubes and devices based on graphene and related materials . to model accurately the self - assembly of these materials we need to describe correctly their interactions , particularly the ubiquitous dispersion interaction .",
    "ab initio_electronic structure methods have now achieved a level of accuracy and computational efficiency that allows them to be applied to such systems .",
    "these methods have exposed the inadequacies of assumptions and approximations made in many empirical models . from the research cited above we now know that the dispersion energy exhibits much more substantial non - additivity than assumed previously .",
    "we emphasise here that empirical models for the dispersion energy prove inadequate because they rely on the assumption of additivity through the pair - wise @xmath13 model with van der waals coefficients @xmath14 between sites @xmath15 and @xmath16 assumed to be isotropic constants , with little or no variation with changes in chemical environment .",
    "part of the missing non - additivity arises from the local chemical environment changes and from through - space coupling between the dipole oscillators .",
    "the remainder arises from the metallic - like contributions that are responsible for the anomalous dispersion effects that are the subject of this paper .",
    "we stress that while the first kind of non - additivity can be described by coupled - oscillator models @xcite and _ ab initio_derived dispersion models such as those obtained from the williams  stone ",
    "misquitta @xcite effective local polarizability models , as we shall see next , the latter , that is , the non - additivity arising from metallic contributions , requires models that take explicit account of extended charge fluctuations .",
    ". an extended fluctuation of @xmath17 in one wire will induce a @xmath18 fluctuation in the other .",
    "if @xmath1 is the separation , we can identify two cases : ( 1 ) @xmath19 and ( 2 ) @xmath20 . as explained in the text , the leading - order dispersion interaction in the former",
    "is associated with charge - induced - charge interactions , and that of the latter with dipole - induced - dipole interactions .",
    "[ fig : edisp2-physics ] , scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the unusual nature of the second - order dispersion energy , @xmath21 , for infinite , parallel 1d wires of arbitrary band gap can be understood as follows .",
    "the electronic fluctuations in the wire are broadly of two types : the short - range fluctuations associated with tightly bound electrons and the long - range plasmon - type fluctuations associated with electrons at the band edge .",
    "the former give rise to the standard dispersion model while the latter are responsible for the effects discussed in this paper and those cited above . for systems with a finite gap",
    ", the plasmon - like modes will be associated with a finite length scale , @xmath22 , defined , for example , via the resta localization tensor @xcite . for metallic systems",
    "this length scale is expected to diverge .",
    "consider now the two cases depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : edisp2-physics ] . in the first case",
    "the wires are separated by @xmath19 . here",
    ", the leading - order contribution from the spontaneous extended fluctuation depicted in the figure is that between charges and leads to the @xmath11 behaviour of @xmath21 : the spontaneous fluctuation at the first wire results in a field @xmath23 at the second and this interacts with the first via another @xmath24 interaction leading to the favourable @xmath11 dispersion energy .",
    "only local charge - pairs contribute to this leading order interaction , consequently the dispersion interaction per unit length remains @xmath11 .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath20 , the extended fluctuation at the first wire generates a dipole field of strength @xmath25 at the second , and the resulting induced ( extended ) dipole interacts with the first via a dipole - dipole interaction leading to another factor of @xmath26 .",
    "this gives a nett favourable dispersion interaction of @xmath27 . in this case , to find the nett dispersion interaction per unit wire length we need to sum over all the interactions between an element of one wire and all elements of the other , which leads to an effective @xmath12 dispersion interaction just as for the point - like fluctuating dipoles of the tightly - bound electrons @xcite .",
    "in both cases , the usual @xmath12 effective dispersion interaction from the tightly bound electrons must be included too .",
    "the length - scale @xmath22 is expected to diverge in a metal , leading to a single power law @xmath11 for @xmath21 . for finite - gap wires",
    "we expect the two regimes described above .",
    "this is exactly the conclusion reached by misquitta _",
    "et al._@xcite and , much earlier , by coulson and davies @xcite .",
    "the second - order dispersion energy is , however , only part of the story . for a group of interacting monomers ( possibly of different types )",
    "the dispersion energy includes contributions from second - order as well as third- and higher - order terms .",
    "the third - order dispersion includes two- and three - body terms @xcite ; the former will be denoted by @xmath28 $ ] and the latter by @xmath29 $ ] .",
    "@xmath28 $ ] is expected to be important for small - gap systems , since these are associated with large hyperpolarizabilities , but we may expect _ a priori _ that as long as @xmath29 $ ] decays slowly enough with trimer separation , it is the three - body non - additive energy @xmath29 $ ] that will be the dominant contributor in the condensed phase due to the far larger number of trimers compared with dimers .",
    "the three - body non - additive energy @xmath29 $ ] is usually modelled using the triple - dipole axilrod  teller  muto expression ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] ) @xcite from which @xmath29 \\sim r^{-9}$ ] , that is , the non - additivity decays very rapidly with separation .",
    "as will be demonstrated below , this expression is not valid for small - gap systems ; instead a more general expression is derived that includes contributions from correlations between the long - wavelength plasmon - like modes . from the physical picture of the second - order dispersion energy given above",
    "we may _ a priori _ expect that the true @xmath29 $ ] will be qualitatively different from that suggested by the triple - dipole expression .",
    "as we shall see below , this is indeed the case .",
    "the multipole expansion is a powerful method , but it would be reassuring to verify its predictions using a non - expanded _ ab initio _ approach . in order to obtain hard numerical data describing the nonadditivity of the dispersion interactions between metallic wires , we have evaluated the binding energy of three parallel , metallic wires in an equilateral - triangle configuration using the variational and diffusion quantum monte carlo ( vmc and dmc ) methods .",
    "vmc allows one to take expectation values with respect to explicitly correlated many - electron wave functions by using a monte carlo technique to evaluate the multidimensional integrals .",
    "the dmc method projects out the ground - state component of a trial wave function by simulating drift , diffusion , and branching processes governed by the schrdinger equation in imaginary time . in our qmc calculations",
    "each wire was modelled as a 1d homogeneous electron gas ( heg ) .",
    "the dependences of the biwire and triwire interactions on the wire separation @xmath1 were evaluated in order to determine the asymptotic power law for the interaction and the non - additive three - body contribution .",
    "we find that the long - range non - additivity is repulsive and scales as a power law in @xmath1 with an exponent slightly less than three .",

    "these deviations occur mainly in two ways :    * for wire separations smaller than the typical electron correlation length , the effective three - body non - additive dispersion behaves as @xmath148 , where @xmath149 as the homo  lumo gag decreases .",

    "et al._@xcite with regard to the second - order dispersion energy @xmath21 , though the effects of metallicity are more dramatic for the three - body non - additivity .",
    "we have provided a simple physical picture of correlations in extended charge fluctuations using which both of these observations can be understood .",
    "we have established these results using two techniques : ( 1 ) a generalised multipole expansion for @xmath29 $ ] that includes contributions from charge - flow polarizabilities responsible for the long - wavelength , plasmon - like fluctuations , and ( 2 ) dmc .",
    "the former has the advantage that we can directly calculate @xmath29 $ ] , but it is applicable only to finite systems with non - zero homo  lumo gaps .",
    "by contrast , dmc is applicable to infinite systems ( modelled in cells subject to periodic boundary conditions ) with zero gaps , and in principle is able to describe the third - order correlation energy exactly .",
    "however , like any supermolecular technique , that is , techniques that calculate the interaction energy from total energy differences , dmc is unable to separate the two - body energy @xmath28 $ ] from the three - body non - additive dispersion @xmath29 $ ] .",
    "nevertheless , there is a consistency in the results from these two methods . at short range ( i.e. , at separations less than the correlation length ) the multipole expansion used on trimers of finite ( h@xmath79)@xmath80 chains yields a power - law of @xmath148 where @xmath152 , that is , @xmath153 approaches @xmath100 from above , while in the dmc results , @xmath154 as @xmath3 increases . for small @xmath3",
    "the exponent is significantly smaller than @xmath100 .",
    "this could be because of finite - size effects , contributions from @xmath28 $ ] , or it could be a genuine effect not captured by the multipole expansion .    the increased effect of the plasmon - like , charge - flow fluctuations on @xmath29 $ ] compared with @xmath155 is related to the long range of these fields produced by the fluctuations .",
    "the dipole fluctuations in insulators result in electric fields that behave as @xmath156 ; a rapid decay compared with the @xmath157 behaviour of the electric fields from the plasmon - type fluctuations .",
    "consequently we expect the many - body expansion to be slowly convergent for conglomerates of low - dimensional semi - metallic systems . as we have demonstrated , the three - body non - additivity quenches the already enhanced two - body dispersion .",
    "likewise , by extending our physical model for these anomalous dispersion effects , we expect that the four - body non - additivity will be attractive and decay as @xmath158 for 1d metallic systems , and will consequently quench the three - body non - additivity .",
    "the slow decay and alternating signs of the @xmath111-body non - additive dispersion suggests that the many - body expansion may not be a useful way of modelling the dispersion interaction in , say , a bundle of 1d semi - metallic wires .",
    "an alternative may be a generalisation of the self - consistent polarization model proposed by silberstein @xcite and applequist @xcite , and recently significantly developed by tkatchenko _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "however , models such as these would have to be modified to include the charge - flow polarizabilities to be able to describe the metallic effects described in this article .    for finite molecular systems , the changes in power - law described here are , to an extent , of academic interest only . in practice ,",
    "subtle power - law changes in the dispersion interaction can be easily masked by the other , often larger , components of the interaction energy , particularly the first - order electrostatic energy .",
    "while this may be the case , it is the second effect  the enhancement of the dispersion energy that arises from the plasmon - like modes  that may have a perceptible effect .",
    "the long - wavelength fluctuations cause an enhancement of the _ effective _ two- and three - body dispersion coefficients .",
