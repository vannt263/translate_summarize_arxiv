    "it is one of the most fundamental problems in hypernuclear physics to extract novel information of @xmath4 interactions through precise calculations for a few - body systems such as @xmath7h , @xmath0he and @xmath0h .",
    "although a number of studies for @xmath0he and @xmath0h have been performed with the use of various models so far , the relations to the underlying @xmath4 interactions are dependent on the adopted models @xcite . in order to explore the features of the @xmath4 interactions",
    ", it is highly required to perform four - body calculation without any restriction in the configuration space .",
    "an especially interesting issue in this relation is to make clear the role of @xmath5-@xmath6 conversion and to get a reliable estimate of the amount of the virtual @xmath6-component in @xmath5 hypernuclei .",
    "however , the @xmath8-@xmath9 coupling terms of the @xmath4 one - boson - exchange ( obe ) models proposed so far have a lot of ambiguity due to scarce information from the @xmath4 scattering experiments .",
    "recently , a series of the realistic @xmath4 interaction models called nsc97a@xmath10f @xcite have been proposed in which the spin - spin strengths are varied within the acceptable range in view of the limited @xmath4 scattering data .",
    "correspondingly , by including the @xmath8-@xmath9 coupling explicitly , miyagawa _ et al_. @xcite performed the faddeev calculations for @xmath7h extensively to test these obe potential models in this lightest system .",
    "they found that the @xmath8-@xmath9 coupling is crucial to get the bound state of @xmath7h and that only the version - f potential is acceptable among nsc97 models .",
    "for the further examination on the @xmath8-@xmath9 coupling , @xmath0he and @xmath0h are much more useful because both of the spin - doublet states have been observed . regarding the representative calculations done so far , gibson _",
    "et al_. employed the coupled two - body model @xcite of @xmath11he(@xmath11h)+@xmath12 which was adopted originally by dalitz and downs @xcite , and then carried out the four - body coupled - channel calculation with the separable potentials of central nature @xcite .",
    "j. carlson tried to perform four - body calclation of these hypernuclei with nsc89 model by using variational monte carlo method @xcite and calculated the binding energies with statistical errors of 100 kev .",
    "et al_. @xcite recently analyzed the role of the @xmath8-@xmath9 coupling for the @xmath13-@xmath14 splitting also in the framework of the coupled two - body model of @xmath11he+@xmath15 .",
    "now our concern is to perform precise four - body calculations of @xmath1 and @xmath2 irrespectively of any model assumptions .",
    "it should be noted that , when one goes from @xmath7h to the @xmath16 strange systems by allowing the @xmath5-@xmath6 conversion , the computational difficulty increases tremendously .",
    "recently we have successfully performed the extensive four - body calculations without any restriction on the configuration space : both the @xmath1 and @xmath2 channels have been incorporated explicitly and all the rearrangement channels of these baryons are taken into account . the variational method with the use of jacobian - coordinate gaussian - basis functions @xcite",
    "is adopted here ; it has been proved to provide us with precise computational results for few - body systems @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of this work is , first , to solve four - body problem of @xmath0he and @xmath0h by taking into account the @xmath17 channels explicitly with the use of realistic @xmath3 and @xmath4 interactions and , secondly , to clarify the role of the @xmath8-@xmath9 coupling in the @xmath16 hypernuclei quantitatively .    in sec .",
    "ii , we describe our method to solve the four - body problem and @xmath4 and @xmath3 interactions adopted here . in sec.iii , we calculate the @xmath5 binding energies , the @xmath6-mixing probabilities and the @xmath8 and @xmath9 correlation functions in @xmath0he and @xmath0h .",
    "the role of the @xmath8-@xmath9 coupling is investigated by dividing its whole contribution into the @xmath8 two - body and @xmath18 three - body parts .",
    "a summary is given in sec .",
    "as the first step before going to the use of sophisticated obe models , we employ here the @xmath8-@xmath9 coupled @xmath4 potential with central , spin - orbit and tensor terms @xcite which simulates the scattering phase shifts given by nsc97f . the potentials parameters for central , spin - orbit and tensor terms are listed in table i.    the main reason of using this simulated version of nsc97f is to focus our attention clearly on the physical ingredients as well as for computational tractability . in this relation , our most important criterion for selecting the @xmath4 interaction",
    "is that the observed binding energy of @xmath7h is reproduced reasonably : the interaction used here leads to the @xmath5-binding energy , @xmath19 mev which agrees well with the observed data @xmath20 mev ) . as for the @xmath3 interaction ,",
    "we employ the av8 potential @xcite .",
    "we shall , however , examine how the choice of the @xmath3 potential affect the @xmath5 binding energy ; we additionally take the bonn a potential @xcite and the minnesota potential ( central force only ) @xcite and investigate the role of the tensor term of @xmath3 potential .",
    "the total four - body wavefunction is described as a sum of the amplitudes of all the rearrangement channels @xmath21 of fig . 1 in the @xmath22 coupling scheme : @xmath23 -0.5 true cm @xmath24_s           \\chi_{\\frac{1}{2}}(y )             \\big]_{s }         \\big]_{jm } \\\\\\ ] ] -0.7 true cm @xmath25_{t }           \\eta_{t_y}(y )             \\big]_{t={\\frac{1}{2 } } }",

    "functional form of @xmath33 is taken as @xmath34 where the gaussian range parameters are chosen to lie in a geometrical progression ( @xmath35 ) , and similarly for @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "these basis functions were verified to be suited for describing both the short - range correlations and the long - range tail behaviour of few - body systems @xcite .",
    "eigenenergies of the hamiltonian and coefficients @xmath38 s are determined by the rayleigh - ritz variational method .",
    "the angular momentum space of @xmath39 is found to be enough to get sufficient convergence of the calculated results mentioned below .",
    "all the calculations have been performed both for @xmath0he and @xmath0h . calculated @xmath40 of the @xmath13 ground state and the @xmath14 excited state of @xmath0he and @xmath0h",
    "are illustrated in fig.2 together with the observed values ( also see table i ) . in the case of taking only the @xmath1 channel ,",
    "both of the two states are unbound . here",
    ", the @xmath2 sector is divided into the @xmath41 and @xmath42 channels in which the three nucleons are coupled to isospin @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively . when the @xmath41 channel is included , the @xmath13 state becomes bound , but the @xmath14 state is still unbound .",
    "then we found that the @xmath14 state becomes bound only when the @xmath42 channel is switched on .",
    "it is noted that the binding energy of the @xmath13 state increases only slightly with this @xmath45 channel .",
    "the @xmath6-channel components turn out to play an essential role in the binding mechanism of the @xmath16 hypernuclei , the @xmath42 channel being specially important in the @xmath14 state .",
    "the calculated binding energy of the @xmath13 state almost reproduces the observed binding energy , while the @xmath14 state is less bound by 0.6 ( 0.4 ) mev for @xmath0h ( @xmath0h ) , and hence the @xmath13-@xmath14 splitting is larger than the observed splitting .",
    "the calculated value of @xmath46 mev is different from the experimental one , @xmath47 mev , although the coulomb potentials between charged particles ( @xmath48 are included .",
    "this difference should be attributed to the charge - symmetry - breaking component which is not included in our adopted @xmath4 interaction .    here , we examine how the calculated @xmath5 binding energies depend on the properties of adopted @xmath3 potentials .",
    "_ once pointed out that the rearrangement effect originated from the @xmath3 tensor force plays an important role for the mass dependence of @xmath5 binding energies of @xmath49 hypernuclei .",
    "now let us focus our concern on the @xmath3 tensor forces : the three @xmath3 potentials compared here are the av8 potential with a stronger tensor force , the bonn a potential with a weaker tensor force and the minnesota potential with a central force only .",
    "the binding energy of the @xmath50h is reproduced reasonably when these @xmath3 potentials are used together with our @xmath4 potential . in fig .",
    "3 the calculated @xmath5 binding energies of the @xmath13 and @xmath14 states in @xmath0he are shown in the cases of using these @xmath3 potentials .",
    "it should be noted here that the larger ratio of the @xmath3 tensor component turns out to bring about the less binding of @xmath5 . in the cases of using av8 and",
    "bonn a , in which the tensor compornents are included more or less realistically , the observed @xmath5 binding energy is reproduced well . however .",
    "the use of the effective model with no tensor force such as the minnesota potential gives rise to the overbinding of @xmath5 by 0.4 mev .",
    "hereafter , we report only the results for the av8 potential , because there is no meaningful differece between the results for the av8 and bonn a potentials .",
    "as listed in table iii , the calculated probabilities of the @xmath2-channel admixture are 2.08% and 1.03% for the @xmath13 and @xmath14 states in @xmath0he , respectively . in the @xmath13 state ,",
    "the probability of the @xmath41 channel is much larger than that of the @xmath42 channel , while in the @xmath14 state they are nearly the same .",
    "we therefore confirm that the @xmath42 channel is especially important in the @xmath14 state .",
    "the @xmath51- , @xmath52- and @xmath53-state probabilities of the channels are also listed in table iii .",
    "it is remarkable that , in the @xmath2 channel , the @xmath53-state component is dominant both in the @xmath13 and @xmath14 states , since the @xmath8-@xmath9 coupling part of the present interaction is dominated by the tensor component .",
    "these properties are almost similar in the case of @xmath54h .",
    "it is of interest to see spatial locations of @xmath55 and @xmath6 particles in the @xmath16 hypernuclei and the correrations between each pairs . for the @xmath13 state of @xmath0he",
    ", we illustrated the correlation functions ( two - body densities ) of the @xmath3 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 pairs ( fig .",
    "4 ) and the ( one - body ) densities of single nucleon and @xmath5 and @xmath6 hyperons ( fig . 5 ) . also , we calculated the r.m.s .",
    "distances between the pair particles ( @xmath56 as well as the r.m.s .",
    "radii @xmath57 of @xmath55 and @xmath6 measured from the c.m .",
    "of @xmath58 ( table ii ) . in fig .",
    "4 , the @xmath3 correlation function in @xmath0he exhibits almost the same shape as that in the @xmath11he nucleus , indicating that the dynamical change of the nuclear size due to the @xmath5 participation is small .",
    "the @xmath8 correlation function is of larger range and flatter than the @xmath3 one , because the strength of the @xmath8 interaction is significantly smaller than the @xmath3 case .",
    "the @xmath9 correlation function is much shorter - ranged than the @xmath8 one due to the large virtual excitation energy ( 80 mev ) of @xmath59 @xmath6 .",
    "these features are verified by the r.m.s .",
    "distances ( @xmath56 listed in table i.    furthermore , we notice that the @xmath5 particle is located much outside the core nucleons ( see @xmath60 and fig . 5 ) and therefore the dynamical change of the core nucleus due to the @xmath5-particle partition is small : the nucleon r.m.s .",
    "radius is @xmath61 fm which is shrinked by 8  % from the corresponding one , @xmath62 1.79 fm in @xmath11he . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath6 hyperon comes close to the nucleons ( see @xmath63 and fig .",
    "4 ) and therefore generates a large dynamical contraction of the core nucleus in the @xmath64-channel space ; @xmath62 1.49 fm is obtained with the @xmath6-channel amplitude only and the reduction rate amounts to @xmath65 . furthermore , it is interesting to see in fig .",
    "4 the following feature of the @xmath6-admixture effect : in spite of the totally small probability of the @xmath6-mixing ( 2 % ) , the @xmath9 components at short distances are not so small in comparison with the @xmath8 ones .",
    "this enhanced short - ranged component of the @xmath6-mixing is expected to be reflected in the non - mesic decay of @xmath66 .    in order to show the physical effect of @xmath6-mixing in more detail ,",
    "let us separate the whole contribution of the @xmath8-@xmath9 coupling interaction into the following two processes illustrated in fig .",
    "6 : the first one is the process ( i ) which can be renormalized into the effective @xmath8 two - body force and the second one is the process ( ii ) which can be represented by the effective @xmath18 three - body force acting in the @xmath1 space .",
    "we solve the schrdinger equation by excluding the three - body process ( ii ) so as to evaluate the contribution of the process ( i ) only .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "6 , the process ( i ) is large enough to make both the @xmath13 and @xmath14 states bound .",
    "we found that the three - body process(ii ) is substantial : this process results in attraction by 0.62 mev in the @xmath13 state , while repulsion by 0.09 mev in the @xmath14 state of @xmath0he and similarly for @xmath0h .    in order to investigate the respective role of the central and the tensor terms of the @xmath8-@xmath9 coupling interaction in the process ( ii ) ,",
    "let us make additional calculations with artificial modification as follows : we replace the @xmath8-@xmath9 coupling part of our original interaction by the purely central interaction and by the purely tensor one without changing the other interaction terms , where the calculated @xmath8 phase shifts are kept almost unchanged .",
    "it is found that the effect of the process(ii ) is quite different between the two cases .",
    "namely , in the case of the purely central - force coupling , the contribution is @xmath67 mev ( attractive ) in the @xmath13 state and @xmath68 mev ( repulsive ) in the @xmath14 state . on the other hand , in the case of the purely tensor - force coupling ,",
    "it becomes much reduced values , @xmath69 mev for the @xmath13 state and @xmath70 mev for the @xmath14 states .",
    "thus , the resulting energies of @xmath13 and @xmath14 states turn out to be controlled substantially by the ratio of the central and the tensor components in the @xmath8-@xmath9 coupling potential .",
    "characteristic feature of our result of the process ( ii ) in the @xmath13 state is similar to that given by akaishi _",
    "et al _ @xcite . in the @xmath14 state",
    ", however , the effect of the process ( ii ) is much different from the result of ref.@xcite : in our treatment the process ( ii ) works repulsively or attractively depending on the ratio of the central and the tensor components in the @xmath8-@xmath9 coupling potential , while the contribution of the process ( ii ) is negligible in ref . @xcite independently of it .",
    "this difference may come from the fact that in the @xmath14 state of @xmath0he , the probability of the @xmath71 is as large as that of the @xmath72 in our result , but the @xmath71 channel can not be explicitly included in the coupled two - body model of @xmath73 of ref.@xcite .",
    "we have developed the calculational method of four - body bound - state problems so that it becomes possible to make precise four - body calculations of @xmath0h and @xmath0he taking both the @xmath1 and @xmath2 channels explicitly into account using realistic @xmath3 and @xmath4 interactions . as a result , we succeeded in making clear the role of @xmath5-@xmath6 conversion and deriving the amount of the @xmath6-mixing in @xmath16 hypernuclei quantitatively . however , our @xmath4 interaction employed here is not sufficient to reproduce the binding energy of the excited state of @xmath14 , although those of ground states of @xmath7h , @xmath0he and @xmath0h are in good agreement with the experimental values .",
    "it is a future problem to explore the feature of @xmath5-@xmath6 conversion in @xmath5 hypernuclei with the use of more refined @xmath4 interactions through systematic study of structure of the heavier hypernuclear systems .",
