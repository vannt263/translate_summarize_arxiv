    "according to the widely accepted unification model ( um ) for active galactic nuclei ( antonucci 1993 , urry & padovani 1995 ) , type 2 and type 1 agn are believed to share the same central region and emission mechanisms with the only difference being due to orientation . in seyfert 2 ,",
    "only optical narrow emission lines are visible , while in seyfert 1 both narrow and broad emission lines are detected ( antonucci & miller 1995 ) .",
    "type 2 agn are seen edge - on , across a large amount of obscuring gas that prevents us from directly observing the central core and the broad line regions ( blr ) .",
    "this scenario is strongly supported by spectropolarimetric observations of hidden broad - line regions ( hblrs ) in several type 2 agn , and by the x - ray observations , demonstrating that seyfert 2 galaxies usually have absorption columns greatly exceeding the galactic ones ( cappi et al .",
    "2006 ) . despite this , and in view of several pieces of evidence coming from recent observations of different classes of agn ,",
    "the um is still being debated . in particular , the association of the compton thick ( a cold gas with n@xmath4 10@xmath5 @xmath6 ) obscuring medium with a uniform torus at intermediate scale between the blr and the narrow line regions ( nlr ) , has been questioned by the presence of column density variability on timescales of hours , requiring an x - ray absorber no larger than the blr .",
    "such changes have been detected in the brightest absorbed seyfert galaxies , ngc 1365 , ngc 4151 and ngc 4388 ( risaliti et al .",
    "2007 , puccetti et al . 2007 , elvis et al . 2004 ) .",
    "it has also been proposed that the co - existence of a compton thick torus and compton thin material , extended on a much larger scale , better accounts for the observed phenomenology in absorbed agn ( e.g. matt 2000 ) .",
    "in addition , some compton thick objects exhibit no optical activity and a weak scattering x - ray component , indicating that the torus is geometrically thicker than previously thought ( ueda et al .",
    "these absorbing media are also responsible for the reflected features ( lines and continuum ) observed in the x - ray energy domain : a compton hump above 10 kev and a fe line at 6.4 - 6.9 kev ( perola et al . 2002 ) .",
    "also , the physical / geometrical properties of environmental materials are subjected to the luminosity of the central supermassive black - hole ( smbh ) ( bianchi et al .",
    "2007 ) . on the other hand , it is also important to understand the behaviour of the complex multi - component spectrum of an agn to clarify the physical view of the central engine . to this end , correct modelling of the x - ray continuum emission is mandatory . finally , the study of obscured agn represents a powerful tool to trace the growth of smbh and to understand how accretion took place throughout cosmic history .",
    "in particular , compton thick agn are the best candidates to explain the unresolved fraction of the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) in the x - ray energy domain around 30 kev ( gilli et al .",
    "2007 ) . in this respect ,",
    "hard x - ray observations , above 10 kev , represent a major improvement in selecting obscured agn that are biased by absorption much less severely than those selected in the 2 - 10 kev band .",
    "however , because of the limited sensitivity of current x - ray detectors at such high energies , these studies can only be conducted in the very local universe .",
    "this kind of study has been performed in a statistical way with a variety of different samples over a broadband energy range : bepposax ( risaliti 2002 ) ,  and  ( de rosa et al . , 2008 ) ,  and swift - bat ( both type 1 and type 2 agn , eguchi et al . 2009 , winter et al .",

    "although the dispersion is huge , we note that , as for the luminosity , no evidence of separation in the accretion rate distribution is evident between absorbed and unabsorbed agn ( kp probability p=0.292 ) .",
    "these results concerning luminosities is also reflected in the spectral properties .",
    "in fact a comparison between the primary photon index in type 1 and type 2 class does not show any evidence for a separation ( see right panel in figure [ bol ] ) being the average value of @xmath16 equal to 1.80 ( @xmath32=0.18 ) and 1.75 ( @xmath32=0.26 ) for type 1 and type 2 respectively .",
    "a ks test in this case gives a probability p=0.862 .",
    "these same conclusions have recently been reached by singh and collaborators ( 2011 ) through the x - ray analysis of an optical selected sample of type 1 and type 2 seyfert .",
    "the value of the l@xmath33/l@xmath35 ratio in our sub - sample of type 1 and type 2 agn range in 0.001 - 3 , extending to higher values with respect to a optical selected sample ( singh et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "we are aware that this result could be affected by two issues .",
    "the first one concerns the mass estimation and its error , that can be as large as 10 - 20 per cent .",
    "it is still debated how accurate the [ oiii ] fwhm is as a proxy of the stellar dispersion @xmath32 and , especially for absorbed agn , there are several inconsistencies between the different techniques used to measure the bh mass .",
    "for the second caveat we assumed equal bolometric correction for both type 1 and type 2 objects , however a different bolometric correction for absorbed and unabsorbed agn ( barger et al .",
    "2005 ) might affect our conclusions on the bolometric luminosity distributions .",
    "finally , we also stress that , using the whole hard x - ray selected sample of 41 type 1 + 33 type 2 from molina et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and the present work , we find that l@xmath3(210 kev ) and l(20100 kev ) have a small probability ( p=0.05 and 0.02 , respectively ) to be drawn from the same parent population .",
    "this effect is likely to be due to a bias in the sample selection ; in fact , due to the less effective area that limits the sensitivity to only bright sources , samples of seyfert agn based on , and _",
    "swift_/bat surveys have shown to contain a relatively large number of high luminosity and less absorbed seyferts ( tueller et al . 2008 ; treister et al .",
    "2009 ; beckmann et al .",
    "in fact , taking into account our total type 1 + type 2 ( 41 + 33 ) sample , we find that the average value of the redshift is 0.05 and 0.03 for type 1 and type 2 respectively , with type 1 extending to higher redshift ( higher luminosity ) than type 2 .",
    "based on the model ( nicastro 2000 ) in which the blrs are formed by accretion disc instabilities occurring in proximity to the critical radius at which the disk changes from gas pressure dominated to radiation pressure dominated , nicastro and collaborators ( 2003 ) suggested that the absence or presence of hidden blrs ( hblrs ) is regulated by the ratio between the x - ray luminosity and the eddington luminosity , which , in the accretion power scenario , is a measure of the rate at which matter falls onto the central supermassive black hole .",
    "following this model , a natural transition between type 1 and type 2 agn should then occur , depending on the accretion rate .",
    "according to nicastro ( 2003 ) , a value of the eddington ratio of 0.001 , i.e. the lowest value measured in our sub - sample of type 1+type 2 agn ( see fig .",
    "[ bol ] , right panel ) , represents the threshold value above which we expect to find hblr ( for obscured objects ) or blr ( for the unobscured ones ) .",
    "optical observations confirm this trend in type 1 agn , while spectropolarimetric observations in a fraction of our sub - sample of type 2 agn has to be performed to confirm the proposed scenario .",
    "in this paper we have discussed the broadband x - ray properties of a sample of 33 absorbed hard x - ray selected agns . we selected a baseline model to reproduce the 0.3100 kev data consisting of an absorbed primary emission with a high energy cutoff and its scattered fraction below 2 - 3 kev , plus the compton reflection features ( compton hump and fe line emission ) .",
    "the broadband data coupled with the good energy resolution at the iron line energy range , allowed us to get a very good characterization of the primary continuum and of all the spectral features .    the main results of this study can be summarized as follows :    * we measure a high - energy rollover below 150 kev in 30% of the sample ( 10/33 ) and estimate a lower limit for the other sources is well below 300 kev .",
    "our analysis suggests that the high energy cut - off is ubiquitous in the x - ray spectra of type 2 agn .",
    "this evidence puts strong constraints on xrb synthesis model .",
    "* the hard x - ray selection allowed us to investigate the n@xmath0 distribution in a sample much less severely biased by absorption with respect to those selected in 210 kev band .",
    "when compared with 2 - 10 kev selected samples , our objects are characterized by larger column density ; this evidence confirms the capability of hard x - ray observations for selecting obscured objects .",
    "in addition , the high s / n ratio of our wide band data allowed us to isolate the compton thick sources in a diagnostic plot ( softness ratio f@xmath36(210 kev)/f(20100 kev ) @xmath2 n@xmath0 ) . *",
    "the value of the fe k@xmath21 ew as a function of the absorbing column density and the broad profile of the line in 4 sources , support the fact that ( at least ) a fraction of the fe line has to be produced in a compton thin gas , likely associated to the blr",
    ". this gas intercepts the line of sight and should also be responsible for the moderate absorption observed in the mildly absorbed sources ( @xmath3710@xmath38 @xmath6 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that we still need a compton thick torus ( not intercepting the line of sight ) in moderately absorbed agn to ( 1 ) produce the reflection continuum observed with  above 10 kev and ( 2 ) to contribute to the production of the fe line emission . to confirm this scenario , broadband time - resolved variability study",
    "are needed , to directly observe the n@xmath0 and fe ew variations .",
    "these observational campaigns have been performed , so far , in just a few sources like ngc1365 , ngc7582 , i.e. the so called  changing look ",
    "agn ( risaliti et al . 2009 and reference therein , bianchi et al .",
    "2009 ) . * a comparison with a hard x - ray selected sample of type 1 agn shows that obscured and",
    "unobscured seyfert are characterized by the same nuclear and accretion properties , i.e. luminosity ( this result holds in both 210 kev and 20100 kev bands ) , bolometic luminosity , eddington ratio and primary photon index .",
    "this evidence suggests that type 1 and type 2 objects should share the same central core .",
    "* the eddington ratio would suggest , according to the model of nicastro ( 2000 ) , that all our type 2 agn hide a blr .",
    "spectropolarimetric measurements are necessary to definitely establish the presence of hblr clouds in the integral agn complete sample .",
