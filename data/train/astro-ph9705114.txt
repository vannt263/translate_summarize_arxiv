    "with the present availability of large databases , including satellite observations at wavebands that can not be observed from the ground , like x - rays , ultraviolet , mid@xmath0far ir , it is possible to construct spectral energy distributions ( sed s ) of galaxies over 10 decades of frequency .",
    "the study of the continuum emission of galaxies over such a broad range of frequencies is important for a good determination of the bolometric luminosity of these objects .",
    "also , the sed s can be used to study the energy output at different wavebands , as well as a means to distinguish galaxies of different activity classes .",
    "previous works , like those of edelson & malkan ( 1986 ) and sanders et al .",
    "( 1989 ) investigated the sed s of agn s .",
    "edelson & malkan ( 1986 ) analyzed a small group of seyfert 1 s , seyfert 2 s and quasars , but did not include radio and x - ray fluxes in their sed s , while sanders et al .",
    "( 1989 ) presented radio to x - ray sed s for a sample of radio loud and radio quiet quasars .",
    "while the sed s of high luminosity agn s have been relatively well studied , little has been done on the sed s of starbursts , seyfert 2 s , liner s and normal galaxies .",
    "mas - hesse et al . (",
    "1994,1995 ) have presented a radio to x - ray multiwavelength analysis of seyfert 1 s , seyfert 2 s , starbursts and quasars , but with relatively sparse data points to cover the frequency range .",
    "they found that these objects can be divided into two major groups , those objects where the far infrared emission dominates the sed ( seyfert 2 s and starbursts ) , and those objects where the uv and x - ray have fluxes comparable to the far infrared ( qso s and seyfert 1 s ) .",
    "they also point out that seyfert 2 s and starbursts have similar sed s , but seyfert 2 s are brighter in the x - rays .",
    "another multiwavelength analysis of starbursts , seyferts , liner s , quasars and normal galaxies was made by spinoglio et al .",
    "they do not use radio and x - ray fluxes and only include a small number of wavebands .",
    "spinoglio et al . (",
    "1995 ) also apply a correction to include the flux of the entire galaxy in their analysis , which is uncertain .",
    "their results show that the nonstellar radiation at 2 - 3@xmath3 m correlates with the iras colors , which produces a sequence of colors , that runs from normal galaxies to seyfert 2 s , seyfert 1 s and quasars .",
    "starbursts fall outside this sequence , because they have an excess of 60@xmath3 m emission .",
    "in contrast to mas - hesse et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , spinoglio et al .",
    "( 1995 ) found that in the mid@xmath0far infrared seyfert 2 s are more similar to seyfert 1 s than to the starbursts , which they attribute to the fact that seyferts are heated by a single source , while starbursts have an extended heating region .",
    "in this paper we present the spectral energy distribution from radio ( @xmath4 hz ) to soft x - rays ( @xmath5 hz ) of a sample of galaxies including starbursts , seyfert 2 s , liner s , normal spirals and ellipticals .",
    "while the data were selected in order to match as closely as possible the iue aperture ( 10@xmath120 ) , the match is indeed not very good , and is the main challenge in assembling and interpreting such a data set .",
    "the galaxies were divided in 6 groups according to activity class and , in the case of quiescent galaxies , according to morphology , for which we create average sed s .",
    "these average sed s are compared to verify whether we can use the sed s to separate different activity classes .",
    "we also present the sed s of hii regions , a thermal snr and a non - thermal snr , which are compared to starburst sed s .    in section 2",
    "we describe our sample and in section 3 we discuss the data and aperture effects .",
    "the sed s of the individual groups are described in section 4 and compared in section 5 . in section 6",
    "we describe the hii regions and supernova remnants sed s and compare them with starbursts sed s . a statistical comparison between the sed s of galaxies with different activity classes is given in section 7 .",
    "the bolometric luminosities are discussed in section 8 , while in section 9 we give the summary .",
    "the galaxies were selected from the catalog of ultraviolet iue spectra of kinney et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and from kinney et al .",
    "we include only those objects for which we have ground based spectra , observed with apertures matching that of iue ( storchi - bergmann , kinney & challis 1995 ; mcquade , calzetti & kinney 1995 ; kinney et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the sample is composed of 59 objects , with 26 star - forming galaxies , 15 seyfert 2 s , 5 liner s , 6 normal spirals , 6 normal ellipticals and 1 bulge of a spiral ( ngc224 , which is treated as an elliptical ) .",
    "their names , morphological types , activity classes , radii and velocities relative to the local group of galaxies are given in table  1 .",
    "for objects with composite activity class we assume that the first class listed in the reference is dominant .",
    "we searched the literature for x - ray , infrared and radio data of the sample galaxies , selecting , when possible , data observed with apertures close to that of the iue satellite ( 10@xmath120 ) . note that although the apertures do nt match very well , a comparison between bolometric fluxes and galaxy diameters ( section 8) , shows that these quantities are relatively independent .",
    "thus the aperture effects do not generally dominate the data .",
    "the uv and optical data ( 14.5@xmath6 log @xmath7 15.5 ) were obtained from table  4 of mcquade et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and table  4 of storchi - bergmann et al .",
    "the uv is composed of iue spectra in the wavelength range 11003200 , while the optical comes from ground based spectra in the range 320010000 observed with matched apertures .",
    "details of the observations and reductions are given in the above papers .",
    "notice that instead of using the spectra , we use only the continuum fluxes measured on selected points , because we are interested only on the continuum energy distribution and not on individual spectral features .",
    "we give in table  2 the uv and optical continuum fluxes for 8 galaxies of the sample , also observed by the authors , but whose data was not previously published .    in table 3",
    "we show the radio data ( log @xmath810 ) , available in the literature , for the objects in table 1 . since the galaxies were not observed exactly at the same wavelengths we indicate in the table header the approximate wavelengths .",
    "the information for each entry is divided in three lines ; on the first line we give the flux ( in units of mjy ) , on the second line we give the actual frequency of the observation ( in units of ghz ) , and on the third line the aperture through which it was observed . on the last column",
    "we give the references from which each entry of the table was obtained , ordered from left to right , according to the numbers listed in table  5 .",
    "the apertures for the radio data vary from 3  to apertures of the order of arcminutes , containing the entire galaxy .",
    "this spread in apertures introduces a large spread in the fluxes , with the smaller apertures including only nuclear emission and the larger apertures including also extended radio emission and emission from hii regions and snr s along the galaxy disk , significantly increasing the flux .",
    "millimeter , near infrared ( 1.2@xmath3m-20@xmath3 m ) and x - ray data are shown in table  4 , in the same format as in table  3 .",
    "millimeter data are rare , being available only for 3 seyfert  2 galaxies .",
    "these data can be considered only as additional information for these galaxies , since we can not compare them with the other classes of objects .",
    "data in the near - infrared range ( 13.5@xmath6 log @xmath714.5 ) are available for the majority of the galaxies in our sample , usually with apertures very close to that of iue .",
    "for the x - ray waveband ( log@xmath915.5 ) we use data from the einstein catalog of fabbiano , kim & trinchieri ( 1992 ) .",
    "we chose to use einstein instead of rosat data , because it has observations available for a larger number of galaxies , including almost all the galaxies observed with rosat ( the only exception is ngc3256 , for which only rosat data are available ) .",
    "the aperture in the x - ray is problematic , because it includes the entire galaxy , with both extended emission and sources in the galaxy disk , farther than the 10@xmath120  central region . in the case of starbursts and seyfert 2 s , where most of the x - ray flux comes from the nuclear region",
    ", the aperture does not affect the results considerably .",
    "however , for liner s and normal galaxies , this assumption is not valid , and their x - ray fluxes may be strongly contaminated by hii regions , supernova remnants and x - ray binaries along the disk of the galaxy .",
    "the x - ray fluxes given in table 4 are integrated over the entire waveband ( 0.2 - 4.0kev for einstein or 0.1 - 2.4 kev for rosat ) . in order to put these fluxes in the same units as the other wavebands , we assume the x - ray spectrum to be @xmath10 , and calculate the flux to the central energy of the band ( 2.1 kev for einstein and 1.25 kev for rosat ) .",
    "the assumption of a slope of 1 ( @xmath11 ) would underestimate the central energy flux by 40% if the true slope was 0.5 , or overestimate it by 40% if the true slope was 1.5 .",
    "the iras data ( 12.5@xmath6 log@xmath7 13.5 ) , in the mid@xmath0far ir ( 12 , 25 , 60 and 100@xmath3 m ) , were obtained from ned ( nasa extragalactic database ) . due to the large aperture through which they were obtained , which varies from 0.75@xmath14.5  at the 12@xmath3 m band to 3@xmath15  at 100@xmath3 m , these data are challenging for our analysis .",
    "the aperture discrepancy is probably the least problematic for starbursts",
    "where , the light is concentrated towards the nucleus according to calzetti et al .",
    "likewise , ir emission from the seyfert 2 galaxies is probably also dominated by nuclear emission .",
    "however , the emission from the liner s and normal galaxies is likely strongly contaminated by sources throughout the galaxy disk .",
    "the sample is divided in six groups : normal ellipticals , normal spirals , seyfert  2 s , liner s , and high and low reddening starbursts .",
    "the division between low and high reddening starbursts is made at e(b ",
    "v)@xmath120.4 , assuming the values given by calzetti , kinney & storchi - bergmann ( 1994 ) . the low reddening group",
    "is composed of the galaxies : haro15 , mrk357 , mrk542 , mrk66 , ngc1140 , ngc3049 , ngc5236 , ngc5253 , ngc6052 , ngc7250 and ugc9560 ; while the high reddening one is composed of : ic1586 , ic214 , ngc1097 , ngc1313 , ngc1672 , ngc3256 , ngc4385 , ngc5860 , ngc5996 , ngc6090 , ngc6217 , ngc7552 , ngc7673 , ngc7714 and ngc7793",
    ".    the foreground galactic extinction for the galaxies in our sample is small , and no correction is applied .",
    "also , due to the small redshift of the galaxies , only the data in the wavelength range 110010000 , corresponding to the iue and ground based spectra , were redshift corrected .",
    "no redshift correction was applied to the broad band data .",
    "the possible errors introduced by these factors are minimal and will not affect the overall analysis .",
    "the individual sed s of normal elliptical and spiral galaxies are shown in figure  1a . sed s of seyfert  2 s and liner s are shown in figure  1b and those of the starbursts of low and high reddening are shown in figure 1c . from now on we will refer to the low and high reddening starbursts as sbl and sbh , respectively .",
    "the sed s are shifted in the figures by arbitrary constants , for clarity .",
    "the radio and x - ray upper limits are shown as filled dots .",
    "notice also that we draw a straight line from the radio to the far - ir 100@xmath3 m wavebands .",
    "this assumption do not represent the real sed in the millimeter region , which according to antonucci , barvainis & alloin ( 1990 ) , present a dip around 1 mm .",
    "the sed s were normalized to the flux at @xmath27000 , which corresponds to a normalization to the old stellar population contribution , and are shown in figure  2 .",
    "the average sed s , obtained from the latter , are shown in figure  3 and their values are given in table  6 .",
    "since the upper limits presented values similar to the real detections in the same wavebands , we decided to include them in the averages .    as we can see in the above figures , the elliptical galaxies have similar sed s in the uv to near - ir range , presenting an old , red stellar population and the uv turn - up .",
    "however , in the mid@xmath0far ir and radio wavebands there is a large difference between individual sed s .",
    "the differences in the mid@xmath0far ir can be attributed to different amounts of dust ( goudfrooij & de jong 1995 ) , while in the radio , the existence of a radio loud nucleus can influence the sed radio tail significantly .",
    "these differences could also be due to the different apertures through which the observations were taken .",
    "the x - ray fluxes have some spread , which is due to the large aperture through which they were observed , including the contribution from sources like x - ray binaries and the hot gaseous halo ( fabbiano 1989 ) , which extend for much more than 10@xmath120 .",
    "normal spiral galaxy sed s , when compared with the sed s of elliptical galaxies , have a considerable spread in the uv to near - ir , which is due to the presence of hii regions in the disk , close to the nucleus of some of these galaxies .",
    "the x - ray data are available for only two objects , showing vastly different values of slope from optical to x - ray and so will not be used in the rest of the analysis .",
    "the mid@xmath0far ir emission , like that emission in the ellipticals , have a large spread , which can be attributed to both aperture and dust effects . in the radio waveband ,",
    "the sed s are very similar , with the exception of ngc598 , which is the higher radio emitter .",
    "this galaxy has a radius far greater than the other spirals in the sample , implying that the difference is due to aperture effects .",
    "the seyfert  2 galaxies have similar sed s in the near - ir to radio wavelengths",
    ". however , they have a large spread in the uv range , being as red as a normal galaxy or as blue as a starburst . this increasing blueness can be due to an increasing contribution from the agn continuum to the spectrum , like in ngc1068 , or to the presence of circumnuclear hii regions , like ngc7130 .",
    "figures 2 and 3 also show that there is a steep drop in the emission from far - ir to the millimeter waveband ( log@xmath1311.5 ) .",
    "this drop , which is similar to the one observed in quasars ( sanders et al .",
    "1989 ; antonucci et al .",
    "1990 ) , represents the end of the thermal emission from radiation reprocessed by the circumnuclear torus and maybe hii regions in the galaxy disk , and the beginning of the non - thermal , synchrotron radio emission .",
    "the liner sed s are similar in the radio and visual part of the spectrum , but have some spread in mid@xmath0far ir and uv wavebands .",
    "the mid@xmath0far ir spread can be explained using the same arguments used above for normal galaxies , while the difference in the uv band can be due to an increasing contribution from a population of young stars , or the active nucleus .",
    "the emission in the x - ray has some spread due to the large aperture .",
    "the sbl s and sbh s have similar sed s along the entire energy spectrum .",
    "the sbl s have a small spread in the uv , while for sbh s the most noticeable spread is in the radio and far ir bands .",
    "the x - ray emission , contrary to what is observed for the rest of the galaxies , drops abruptly relative to the uv emission in both types of starburst galaxies .",
    "the emission in the x - ray comes mostly from snr , concentrated in the starburst region .",
    "in figure 4 we make a comparison between objects of similar activity class , normalized again at @xmath27000 . on the bottom panel",
    "we compare the average sed of normal ellipticals and spirals .",
    "the two groups are very similar from the radio to the visual waveband .",
    "the most significant difference is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum , where the spirals have an increasing contribution from hii regions .",
    "the apparent large difference at log@xmath1313.5 may be due to the fact that at this waveband , flux was available only for some of the ellipticals and for no spirals .",
    "likewise , the difference in the x - ray fluxes is uncertain due to the small number of spirals with available x - ray fluxes .    on the middle panel",
    "we compare the sed s of liner s and seyfert 2 s .",
    "the two sed s overlap only in the visual to near - ir region ( 14@xmath14log@xmath1515 ) , where they are dominated by the old stellar population , differing in all other wavebands ( but see below , where liner s and seyfert 2 s are compared using different normalizations ) .",
    "the uv and x - ray emission of seyfert 2 s is larger than that of liner s , consistent with a larger contribution from the active nucleus , or in some cases , the presence of a circumnuclear hii region .",
    "the seyfert 2 s are also brighter than liner s in the mid@xmath0far ir and radio wavebands .",
    "most of the ir emission in seyfert 2 s is probably due to reradiation of the nuclear emission by a circumnuclear torus ( storchi - bergmann , mulchaey & wilson 1992 ) , which is possibly not present in liner s .",
    "the higher radio emission from the seyfert 2 s can be explained by the higher nuclear activity of these objects .    on the top panel of figure 4",
    "we compare the sed s of sbh s and sbl s .",
    "these two sed s are very similar along the entire energy spectrum .",
    "the only differences are in the ultraviolet , where the sbl s are brighter than sbh s due to the lower reddening , and in the mid@xmath0far ir , where sbh s are brighter than sbl s .",
    "this behaviour was studied by calzetti et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , who found that the energy absorbed in the uv is reradiated in the mid@xmath0far ir .    in figure 5",
    "we show the comparison among groups of different activity class . on the top",
    "left panel we plot the seyfert 2 s , sbl s and sbh s sed s .",
    "these sed s are similar from the radio to near - ir waveband .",
    "however , they start to diverge in the visual towards uv wavelengths . in this waveband the seyfert 2 s are dominated by the old stellar population and have the reddest energy distribution , probably due to the obscuration of the agn continuum by the torus , while sbh s and sbl s are increasingly bluer , and dominated by the young stellar population . these sed s also differ in the x - ray waveband where the seyfert 2 s are brighter . on the top right panel",
    "we show the liner s , sbh s and sbl s sed s .",
    "the only wavelength region where these sed s are similar is from the visual to the near - ir , where they are normalized .",
    "the liner s sed is systematically fainter at all other bands .    on the bottom left panel of figure 5",
    "we show the sed s of liner s , seyfert 2 s and spirals .",
    "the liner s and spirals have similar sed s , only differing in the mid@xmath0far ir and uv , where the spirals are fainter than the liner s .",
    "seyfert 2 s and spirals sed s are similar only in the near - ir to visual waveband , where they are dominated by the old stellar population .",
    "the seyfert 2 s are much brighter than the spirals in the ir and uv .",
    "the sed s of spirals , sbl s and sbh s are compared on the bottom right panel of figure 5 .",
    "here we can see the difference between sed s dominated by old ( spirals ) and young stellar populations ( sbh s and sbl s ) .",
    "the only wavelength region where these sed s can be considered similar is in the visual to near - ir , again the region where they are normalized . in these region",
    "the starbursts have some contribution from old stars .",
    "the spirals are fainter in any other waveband .    in figure 6",
    "we compare the sed s of liner s and seyfert 2 s ( top ) , sbl s and sbh s ( bottom ) with those of radio quiet and radio loud quasars from sanders et al .",
    "( 1989 ) ( rqq and rlq hereafter ) .",
    "in contrast to the previous analysis , here the sed s were normalized to the 60@xmath3 m flux .",
    "we chose @xmath260@xmath3 m as normalization wavelength because this is the wavelength region that is the most isotropic in the entire quasars sed ( pier & krolik 1992 ) .",
    "we could not find an average sed for seyfert 1 s , but a comparison between the rqq sed with that of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc3783 ( alloin et al . 1995 ) , showed that they are very similar .",
    "the comparison between the sed s of quasars and the other galaxies shows that quasars are @xmath160.5 dex brighter in the mid@xmath0far - ir , @xmath161 dex brighter in the near - ir , and @xmath162 to 2.5 dex brighter in the visual to x - ray region of the spectrum . the only exception to the above differences are for liner s in the visual to near - ir region of the spectrum , whose sed",
    "s touch those of the quasars .",
    "this is due to the fact that the nuclear luminosity of liner s , i.e. the energy emitted from the nuclear engine is much smaller than that of quasars .",
    "when the sed s are normalized to the radiation that is emitted isotropically from the nucleus ( 60@xmath3 m ) , the near - ir and visual regions of the sed s of liner s , which are dominated by the stellar population in these objects , will be shifted to values comparable to those of quasars . in the radio waveband ,",
    "the rqq s sed is similar to that of seyfert 2 s , starbursts and liner s , while the rlq s sed s are @xmath163 dex brighter than all others . from figure 6",
    "we see that the rqq and rlq sed s are dominated by the visual and uv emission , which is due to the nuclear featureless continuum .",
    "as opposed to the seyfert 2 s , liner s and starbursts , quasars do not have a pronounced mid@xmath0far ir emission bump relative to the visual and uv parts of the spectrum .",
    "another interesting fact to be noticed in this figure is the similarity between the sed s of seyfert 2 s and liner s , when we normalize them to the 60@xmath3 m flux . with the exception of the visual and near - ir region of the spectrum where , due to their low nuclear luminosity",
    "liner s are dominated by the stellar population , the two sed s are very similar , suggesting that liner s are indeed low luminosity relatives of seyferts .",
    "here we describe the sed of hii regions , a thermal and a non - thermal supernova remnant ( snr ) .",
    "these sed s can be compared with those from starbursts , in order to determine the wavebands where the young components contribute most to the sed .    as examples of single hii regions we use ngc5455 , ngc5461 and ngc5471 , in the disk of m101 , and ngc604 in the disk of m33 .",

    "the final fluxes are 4.63@xmath110@xmath29 , 1.1@xmath110@xmath29 and 4.87@xmath110@xmath30 erg @xmath26 s@xmath27 @xmath27 for 1350 , 2200  and 2900 , respectively .",
    "the fluxes of individual hii regions , as well as the average sed of hii regions , n49 and crab nebula are given in table 7 .",
    "we show in figure 7 the individual hii regions sed s normalized to the flux at @xmath27000 .",
    "these sed s are very similar along the entire energy spectrum , showing a steep ultraviolet continuum , a small bump in the near - ir ( log@xmath1314 hz ) and a large bump in the mid@xmath0far ir .",
    "however , the near - ir bump is uncertain , due to the different apertures through which the visual and near - ir data were obtained .",
    "this same problem may be affecting the mid@xmath0far ir bump , since the iras apertures are much larger than the hii regions and can include emission from warm and cold dust in the galaxy disk ( notice that ngc5455 do not have iras data available ) .    in figure 8",
    "we compare the sed s of the thermal snr , non - thermal snr and average hii regions , normalized to the hii regions flux at radio 6 cm .",
    "the non - thermal snr has a flat sed from the x - rays to the infrared waveband .",
    "it has some thermal emission in the mid ir ( woltjer 1987 ) and drops towards the radio waveband .",
    "the thermal snr has a steep uv to optical sed , like the hii regions .",
    "this emission comes from h and he recombination radiation and two photons continuum emission ( vancura et al .",
    "the flux drops from uv to x - ray , where it is similar to that of non - thermal snr and stronger than hii regions .",
    "the thermal snr sed also shows an increase in the far - ir emission due to cold dust reradiation , and then drops to the radio waveband .    in figure 9",
    "we compare the sed s of sbl s and sbh s with those of hii regions ( left panel ) and snr s ( right panel ) .",
    "the hii regions and starbursts are normalized relative to the 25@xmath3 m flux , instead of the @xmath27000 , because the 25@xmath3 m corresponds to the warm dust emission , which should be similar in these two classes of objects .",
    "the snr s were again normalized to the flux of hii regions at radio 6 cm ( log@xmath319.7 ) .",
    "hii regions and starbursts have similar sed s in the mid@xmath0far ir parts of the spectrum , but differ in the x - ray and radio , where hii regions have smaller fluxes .",
    "in the uv part of the spectrum hii regions are similar to sbl s , but are much brighter than sbh s .",
    "however , starbursts are stronger than hii regions in the visual and near - ir parts of the spectrum .",
    "this difference is due to the fact that in hii regions we observe only the young stellar population , while in starbursts we observe a significant amount of underlying old stellar population , which contributes mostly to the visual and near - ir parts of the sed .",
    "the comparison between the sed s of snr s and starbursts shows that non - thermal snr s and starbursts are similar only in the radio , with the non - thermal snr being stronger in x - rays and fainter in the other wavebands .",
    "the thermal snr and the starbursts have similar sed s in the radio .",
    "thermal snr s are fainter than starbursts in the visual to mid@xmath0far - ir , but fainter in the uv and x - rays .",
    "can we distinguish between different classes of galaxies based on their sed s ? in order to statistically study this",
    "we have chosen several wavebands , normalized to the @xmath27000  flux , and compared the different sed s using student s t - test .",
    "we use hare the normalization to the @xmath27000  flux because it represents a normalization to the old stellar population .",
    "however , it should be kept in mind that a different normalization would produce different results , such as with the normalization of liner s and seyfert 2 s at 60@xmath3 m .",
    "table 8 shows the wavebands used and the number of galaxies with those wavebands available in each group .",
    "the results of the comparison are shown in table 9 and figure 10 , where we give the probability of two sed s being equal .",
    "two sed s are considered to be significantly different when the t - test gives probabilities smaller than 0.05 ( 5% ) , which corresponds to 2@xmath32 difference .",
    "this value is noted with a line in figure 10 . if the probability is between 0.05 and 0.2 ( between @xmath161.3 and 2.0 @xmath32 ) ,",
    "the sed s are considered to be moderately different , which means that this difference can be considered as a tendency , but should be used with caution to distinguish between two different activity classes .",
    "notice that we are not comparing the 6 cm and x - ray emission of normal spirals with other galaxies , because there is only a small number of spirals detected in these wavebands .    on the bottom panel of figure 10",
    "we compare objects of similar activity class . in agreement with the results of the previous section",
    ", sbh s and sbl s can be well distinguished in the visual uv and far - ir parts of the spectrum .",
    "seyfert 2 and liner sed s are significantly different only at 25@xmath3 m . however , with the exception of the near - ir optical band ( 14@xmath14log@xmath1514.5 hz ) , where they are very similar , the probability of the two sed s being equal , in the remaining wavebands the difference is only moderately significant .",
    "the comparison between ellipticals and spirals shows that their sed s are very similar . only in the uv ( 1355 )",
    "the probability of the two distributions being equal reaches values smaller than 0.15 .    on the middle panel",
    "we compare active ( seyfert 2 , liner , sbh and sbl ) with normal spiral galaxies sed s .",
    "we chose to compare the active galaxies only to the normal spirals , because the ellipticals sed s are very similar to them , and also because the host galaxies of the active objects are spirals .",
    "the spirals can be separated from sbh s and sbl s in the mid@xmath0far ir , visual and uv wavebands .",
    "the comparison with the seyfert 2 template shows that the two sed s can be well separated in the mid@xmath0far ir and also in the uv ( 2900 ) .",
    "liner s and spirals are similar along most of the energy spectrum . only in the mid@xmath0far ir",
    "is the probability of the two distributions close enough to 0.05 for them to be considered as moderately different .    on the top panel of figure 10",
    "we compare the sed s of sbh s and sbl s with seyfert 2 s and liner s .",
    "seyfert 2 s sed is different from both sbh s and sbl s in the visual and uv waveband , and also different from sbl s in the near - ir .",
    "it can be considered as moderately different from sbh s in the x - rays and near - ir .",
    "the liner s sed is different , or moderately different from that of sbl s in the uv to mid ir range .",
    "when compared to sbh s , liner s are different in the uv , visual and mid@xmath0far ir wavebands .    in conclusion ,",
    "the statistical analysis confirms the qualitative results from the previous sections .",
    "the largest differences over the entire 10 decades of frequency exist between liner s and sbl s . in all other cases ,",
    "the differences are limited to specific ranges , such as those between seyfert 2 s and liner s in the mid@xmath0far ir and uv .",
    "normal galaxies can be separated from active ones ( starbursts , liner s and seyfert 2 s ) by the lower mid@xmath0far ir , and uv emission , relative to the visual .",
    "seyfert 2 s and liner s can be easily differentiated from starbursts , based on their smaller uv@xmath0visual ratio .",
    "the bolometric fluxes were calculated by integrating the sed s .",
    "the contribution of the x - ray band to the bolometric luminosity is very small , and consequently does not affect the results for those galaxies without data available in this waveband .",
    "a comparison between the bolometric fluxes and galaxy diameters shows that these quantities are independent .",
    "this result assures us that the flux of wavebands like the mid@xmath0far ir , which were observed through apertures much larger than that of the iue , are not shifting the bolometric flux of large objects to higher values .    in figure 11",
    "we compare the bolometric flux with the flux density of selected wavebands . considering all galaxies together",
    ", the 100@xmath3 m flux density shows the best correlation with the bolometric flux .",
    "when we consider only galaxies of the same activity class , their bolometric fluxes also show a good correlation with the flux density in other wavebands .",
    "we can also see in this figure that the wavebands which contribute most to the bolometric flux in seyfert 2 s , liner s and starbursts are the mid@xmath0far ir . for normal galaxies ,",
    "the emission from these wavebands is weaker and the wavebands which contribute most to the bolometric flux are the near - ir and visual .    the observed correlation can be used to obtain the bolometric flux of galaxies with different activity classes , based on information of a limited wavelength range . in order to quantify this , we separate the galaxies in groups , according to activity class : normal galaxies ( spirals @xmath17 ellipticals ) , seyfert 2 s , sbl s and sbh s .",
    "liner s are excluded from this analysis because of the small number of objects in the sample .",
    "for these groups we perform linear fits of the form @xmath33 .",
    "the resulting coefficients `` a '' and `` b '' , as well as the correlation coefficients of the linear fits are given in table 10 .",
    "for normal galaxies , the near - ir wavebands are the ones which better correlate with the bolometric flux . for seyfert 2 s",
    "the bolometric flux correlates well with the flux in the mid@xmath0far ir bands .",
    "sbl s bolometric flux correlates well with the fluxes of the wavebands in the range 2530  to far - ir , while for sbh s the best correlation is in near and far - ir .",
    "in this paper we built the radio to x - ray sed s of 59 galaxies , including normal spirals , ellipticals , liner s , seyfert 2 s and starbursts . also , for the comparison with starbursts , we built sed s for hii regions , thermal and non - thermal snr s .",
    "we used data selected from the literature , trying to match the iue aperture ( 10@xmath120 ) , and discuss the possible contamination effects for the wavebands observed with larger apertures .",
    "the sed s were normalized to the flux at @xmath27000 , which corresponds to a normalization by the old stellar population , and averaged according to their activity and morphological classes .",
    "both a qualitative and a quantitative comparison between the sed s of different classes of objects were performed , giving similar results , which can be summarized as follows .",
    "the normal spirals and ellipticals have similar sed s over the entire energy range , but are fainter than the other sed s , relative to the @xmath27000  flux .",
    "the seyfert 2 sed s are similar to those of liner s in the visual and near - ir , but stronger in the other wavebands .",
    "when compared to starbursts , seyfert 2 s have similar sed s in the radio to near - ir , are weaker in the ultraviolet , but stronger in the x - rays . the sbh s and sbl s sed s are very similar along the entire energy range , with the exception of the ultraviolet , where sbh s are weaker , and mid@xmath0far ir , where they are stronger .",
    "these differences can be accounted to the higher absorption and reradiation of the ionizing radiation in sbh s .",
    "the sed s of seyfert 2 s , liner s and starbursts were compared with sed s of rqq and rlq , normalized to the flux at @xmath260@xmath3 m .",
    "the quasars sed s are between 1 and 2 dex stronger than the other sed s , depending on the waveband . the exception occurs for rqq sed s , which are similar to those of the other galaxies in the radio to far - ir wavebands . from this comparison",
    "we have also found that , when using the normalization at @xmath260@xmath3 m , the sed s of liner s and seyfert 2 s are very similar , with the exception of the optical to near - ir wavebands where liner s are dominated by the old stellar population .    we have also constructed sed s of hii regions , thermal and non - thermal snr s .",
    "hii regions and thermal snr s have similar sed s and differ only in the x - rays , where hii regions are fainter , and far - ir , where hii regions are stronger .",
    "the sed of the non - thermal snr is a flat continuum , for which we do not have a good normalization point to compare with the other sed s .",
    "the comparison of starbursts with hii regions shows that they are very similar , with the exception of the x - rays , visual and near - ir , where starbursts are stronger , due to the contribution from old stars in the visual and near - ir , and `` superwinds '' in x - rays ( heckman , armus & miley 1990 ) .",
    "finally , we calculated the bolometric fluxes of the galaxies and compared them with the flux densities of individual wavebands . from this comparison we found that the mid@xmath0far ir emission dominates the energy output in seyfert 2 s , liner s and starbursts . for spirals and ellipticals the visual and near - ir emission contributes most to the bolometric flux .",
    "we have also performed linear regressions between the bolometric fluxes and flux densities , which can be used to determine the bolometric flux of objects with reduced waveband information .",

    "<S> we present the results of an extensive literature search of multiwavelength data for a sample of 59 galaxies , consisting of 26 starbursts , 15 seyfert 2 s , 5 liner s , 6 normal spirals and 7 normal elliptical galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the data include soft x - ray fluxes , ultraviolet and optical spectra , near , mid@xmath0far infrared photometry and radio measurements , selected to match as closely as possible the iue aperture ( 10@xmath120 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the galaxies are separated into 6 groups with similar characteristics , namely , ellipticals , spirals , liner s , seyfert 2 s , starbursts of low and high reddening , for which we create average spectral energy distributions ( sed ) .    the individual groups sed s are normalized to the @xmath27000  flux and compared , looking for similarities and differences among them . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the sed s of normal spirals and ellipticals are very similar over the entire energy range , and fainter than those of all other groups . </S>",
    "<S> liner s sed s are similar to those of seyfert 2 s and starbursts only in the visual to near - ir waveband , being fainter in the remaining wavebands . </S>",
    "<S> seyfert 2 s are similar to starbursts in the radio to near - ir waveband , fainter in the visual to ultraviolet , but stronger in the x - rays . </S>",
    "<S> low and high reddening starbursts are similar along the entire sed , differing in the ultraviolet , where low reddening starbursts are stronger , and in the mid@xmath0far ir where they are fainter .    </S>",
    "<S> we have also collected multiwavelength data for 4 hii regions , a thermal supernova remnant , and a non - thermal supernova remnant ( snr ) , which are compared with the starburst sed s . </S>",
    "<S> the hii regions and thermal snr s have similar sed s , differing only in the x - ray and far infrared . </S>",
    "<S> the non - thermal snr sed is a flat continuum , different from all the other sed s . comparing the sed s of starbursts and hii regions we find that they are similar in the mid@xmath0far ir parts of the spectrum , but hii regions are fainter in the radio and x - rays . </S>",
    "<S> starbursts are also stronger than hii regions in the visual and near - ir parts of the spectrum , due to the contribution from old stars to starbursts .    </S>",
    "<S> the bolometric fluxes of the different types of galaxies are calculated integrating their sed s . </S>",
    "<S> these values are compared with individual waveband flux densities , in order to determine the wavebands which contribute most to the bolometric flux . in seyfert 2 </S>",
    "<S> s , liner s and starbursts , the mid@xmath0far ir emission are the most important contributers to the bolometric flux , while in normal spirals and ellipticals this flux is dominated by the near - ir and visual wavebands . </S>",
    "<S> linear regressions were performed between the bolometric and individual band fluxes for each kind of galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> these fits can be used ine the calculation of the bolometric flux for other objects of similar activity type , but with reduced waveband information . </S>"
