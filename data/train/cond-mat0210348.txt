    "since the first experimental observation of bose - einstein condensates  @xcite a considerable effort has been devoted to studies of low dimensional ultra - cold trapped gases  @xcite .",
    "there are several fundamental reasons for the interest in these systems .",
    "firstly , atom - atom interactions can be modified in low dimensions  @xcite .",
    "secondly , the physics in low dimensional systems can be remarkably different from the situation in three dimensions .",
    "for example , a one dimensional condensate in the limit of ultra - low densities should behave as a strongly correlated system of impenetrable bosons , the so - called tonks gas  @xcite .",
    "the third , and perhaps the most important reason to study low temperature 1d condensates , is the particular potential that such condensates offer for applications .",
    "proposals of atom optics and precision atom interferometry with coherent matter waves rely on placing the condensate in a 1d waveguide .",
    "such a waveguide can be formed in appropriately designed traps  @xcite or on the surface of an atom chip  @xcite .",
    "one could then use the bec on such a chip to perform beam splitting and , finally , beam recombination in a waveguide .",
    "however , it has been shown that bec in quasi 1d geometries exhibit significant phase fluctuations  @xcite . even at very low temperatures ( of the order of fractions of the critical temperature @xmath0 ) the coherence length of such a phase - fluctuating bec may be shorter than the size of the condensate .",
    "the condensate then exhibits a spatially varying phase pattern and is commonly called a _",
    "quasicondensate_. in the thomas - fermi regime  @xcite , that is , when the nonlinear mean field energy is much larger than the kinetic energy , density fluctuations are suppressed due to their energetic cost .",
    "that is not the case , however , for the phase fluctuations .",
    "the prediction of phase fluctuations  @xcite was experimentally confirmed in  @xcite .",
    "the results of our experiments set important limitations on the future applications of bec in interferometry which employ 1d waveguides .",
    "it is , therefore , particularly important to study and characterize phase fluctuations in elongated becs and , even more , to develop methods that allow to control the phase of these condensate .",
    "the first part of this paper concerns the experimental investigation of two aspects of phase - fluctuating becs .",
    "first the dynamical behavior during a time - of - flight after release from a strongly elongated trap is examined .",
    "very good quantitative agreement between theory and experiment is established for these measurements .",
    "a second set of measurements is devoted to the investigation of the density of a phase - fluctuating trapped condensate .",
    "we confirm that the density fluctuations are strongly suppressed and show that the second order correlation function @xmath1 is largely independent of the amount of phase fluctuation in our experimental regime .",
    "the second part of the paper deals with theoretical approaches to overcome the effects of phase fluctuations .",
    "we propose to use the technique of parametric resonance to control the overall phase of the condensate .",
    "it should be noted that parametric resonance has already been discussed in the context of bec  @xcite , but those studies were aimed at employing the parametric resonance to create patterns and textures in the density of trapped becs .",
    "clearly , for the reasons mentioned above , such a goal is not easily accomplished in highly nonlinear systems for which fluctuations of the mean field energy are costly .",
    "we , however , aim at controlling the phase of a quasi 1d condensate by applying the standard technique of modulating the trap frequency  @xcite . thus , rather than to excite density modulations of the condensate , we intend to engineer its phase , such that some modes contributing to the phase fluctuations can be suppressed or enhanced without destroying the condensate .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we briefly review the physics of phase fluctuations in elongated traps , and recall the expressions describing the transformation of phase fluctuations into density modulations  @xcite . in section 3",
    "we present recent experimental results which expand the observations reported in our earlier work .",
    "these results show that a full quantitative characterization of phase fluctuations can be achieved and that density modulations are suppressed even when phase fluctuations are present in a trapped condensate . in section 4 , we describe the method of employing parametric resonance to enhance or suppress selected modes of the phase fluctuations .",
    "we present model calculations based on numerical solutions of the 1d gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation which governs the dynamics of the condensate .",
    "for becs in 3d trapping geometries the fluctuations of density and phase are only important in a narrow temperature range near the bec transition temperature @xmath0 ( critical fluctuations ) . outside this region ,",
    "the fluctuations are suppressed and the condensate is phase and density coherent . in reduced dimensions , the situation can be rather different ( see  @xcite and refs . therein ) : the axial phase fluctuations can manifest themselves even at temperatures far below @xmath0 .    in the following we consider a cylindrically symmetric condensate in the thomas - fermi regime , where the mean field ( repulsive ) interparticle interaction greatly exceeds the radial ( @xmath2 ) and axial ( @xmath3 ) trap energies . at @xmath4",
    "its density profile has the well - known shape @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the maximum condensate density , @xmath7 is the chemical potential , @xmath8 is the interaction coupling constant , @xmath9 is the atomic mass , and @xmath10 the scattering length . under the condition @xmath11 ,",
    "the radial size of the condensate , given by the thomas - fermi radius @xmath12 , is much smaller than the axial size , given by the corresponding thomas - fermi length @xmath13 .",
    "the phase fluctuations can be described by solving the bogoliubov - de gennes equations describing elementary excitations of the condensate .",
    "the quantum field annihilation operator of atoms can be written as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the operator of the phase , and the density fluctuations have already been neglected following the arguments discussed above .",
    "the single - particle correlation function is then expressed + through the mean square fluctuations of the phase ( see e.g.  @xcite ) : @xmath16 ^ 2\\rangle/2\\},\\!\\ ] ] with @xmath17 .",
    "the operator @xmath15 is given by ( see e.g.  @xcite ) @xmath18^{-1/2}\\sum_{j}f_j^{+}({\\bf r})\\hat a_j   + \\mbox{h.c.},\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the annihilation operator of the excitation with quantum number @xmath20 and energy @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and the excitation functions @xmath23 are determined by the bogoliubov - de gennes equations in the thomas - fermi limit .",
    "the `` low - energy '' axial excitations ( with energies + @xmath24 ) have wavelengths larger than @xmath25 and exhibit a pronounced 1d behavior . hence",
    ", one expects that these excitations give the most important contribution to the long - wave axial fluctuations of the phase .",
    "the solution of the hydrodynamic counterpart of the bogoliubov - de gennes equations in the thomas - fermi limit for such low - energy axial modes yields the spectrum @xmath26",
    "@xcite , where @xmath20 is a positive integer .",
    "the wavefunctions @xmath27 of these modes have the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 are jacobi polynomials .",
    "note that the specific form of the excitation spectrum and the @xmath30-dependence of the mode functions results in the quasi 1d limit from the integration of the mode functions over the transverse directions , as pointed out for instance in ref .",
    "@xcite .",

    "( [ deltal ] ) , one obtains the direct dependence on the experimental parameters : @xmath37 strong phase fluctuations are thus associated with high trap aspect ratios @xmath38 , weak axial confinement @xmath39 , high temperatures @xmath40 and small numbers of condensed atom @xmath41 .    the signature of a fluctuating phase can be observed experimentally as density modulations ( stripes ) in the ballistic expansion .",
    "the formation of these stripes can be understood as follows : after switching off the trap , the mean field interaction rapidly decreases and the axial phase pattern is converted into a velocity distribution .",
    "this spatial velocity distribution leads to the appearance of stripes in the density after a time - of - flight .",
    "these stripes have been described analytically  @xcite using a generalization of the bogoliubov - de gennes equation for the self - similar solution ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",

    "we emphasize the main features of the apparatus and the technical changes that have led to the observation of more pronounced effects of phase fluctuations in the ballistic expansion of an elongated condensate .",
    "we have adapted the trap geometry to obtain aspect ratios @xmath51 and reduced axial confinement .",
    "these high trap aspect ratios are achieved by axial decompression of our cloverleaf trap  @xcite , lowering the currents in both the pinch coils and their bias coils .    for the experiments reported here",
    ", a bose - einstein condensate of @xmath52rb atoms in the @xmath53 state is produced in the axially decompressed trap with axial and radial trapping frequencies 3.4  hz and 380  hz respectively , by using the following procedure .",
    "we load a magneto - optical trap with a few times @xmath54 atoms from a chirp slowed thermal beam , followed by a short period of sub - doppler cooling .",
    "part of the sub - doppler cooling stage operates without repumping the atoms from the @xmath55 state , letting them accumulate in the lower hyperfine state . after optical pumping to the low field seeking @xmath56 state , the atomic cloud",
    "is loaded into a cloverleaf magnetic trap . a cleaning light pulse on resonance with the @xmath57 atoms from the trap .",
    "finally , the atomic cloud is adiabatically compressed to allow efficient radio frequency evaporative cooling .",
    "the condensate is loaded in the axially decompressed trap by using a two step evaporation procedure .",
    "the initial evaporative cooling is performed in our standard trap with aspect ratio 26 , then the trap is ramped to the high aspect ratio configuration , and the final evaporation is carried out in that trapping geometry . after waiting for 4  seconds to allow the system to reach an equilibrium state we switch off the trapping potential within @xmath58s and",
    "wait for a variable time - of - flight before detecting the atomic cloud by resonant absorption imaging .",
    "the experimental observation of phase fluctuations profits from this adapted trap configuration as indicated by eq .",
    "( [ deltalexp ] ) .",
    "our present measurements show strong fluctuations both due to the high aspect ratio and the weak axial confinement of our trap .",
    "these lead to a large axial condensate size ( in the elongated trap , @xmath59 m ) with respect to the detection resolution of @xmath60 m , thus favoring the observation of structures in the condensate density after time - of - flight .",

    "it was shown that the general dependence on temperature , trapping potential and number of atoms given in eq .",
    "( 3 ) of  @xcite agrees qualitatively with the experimental observations .",
    "most data was acquired after a long time - of - flight of 25  ms since the effect of phase fluctuations is best observed then . however , here we present observations of the dynamical transformation of phase fluctuations into density modulations and quantitatively compare them to the theoretical predictions .    fig .",
    "[ fig_exp1](a ) shows typical images of the ballistically expanded clouds for various times - of - flight @xmath46 .",

    "[ fig_exp1](b ) shows the large influence of phase fluctuations on the expansion of the condensate . to avoid high optical densities , which would influence the visibility of density modulations , we detuned the detection laser with respect to the atomic resonance for short times - of - flight .",
    "the amount of phase fluctuations present in a given bec was determined by comparing the observed line density profile with the expected bimodal profile when no phase fluctuations are present . in this bimodal profile",
    "the bec fraction is described by a parabolic thomas - fermi component and the thermal cloud by a gaussian distribution , both integrated along the radial direction .",
    "the deviation of the experimental density profile from the fitted function is calculated at every data point in the interval @xmath64 and normalized by the fitted condensate density at that point .",
    "the average of the squares of these values is called @xmath65 and represents a normalized spatial average of the phase fluctuations in a single condensate . the temperature and particle number of each condensate",
    "were determined by separate 2d fits to the absorption images .",
    "note that phase fluctuations in an elongated bec are stochastic . during the expansion",
    ", the instantaneous phase of the bec at the time of release is converted into density modulations and therefore images taken under the same initial conditions can look significantly different .",

    "we obtain very good quantitative agreement between our results and the theoretical predictions , confirming that the transfer mechanism of phase fluctuations into density modulations during time - of - flight is well understood .",
    "the theoretical description of phase fluctuations is based on the prediction  @xcite that density modulations are strongly suppressed in the magnetic trap . in the thomas - fermi regime , where the mean field energy dominates over the kinetic energy , the excitation of density modulations requires a high energetic cost on the order of the chemical potential .",
    "the measurements reported in fig .",
    "[ fig_exp2 ] clearly show that the observed density modulations are suppressed as the time - of - flight approaches zero .",
    "however , this does not rule out the existence of density modulations on a length scale smaller than our experimental resolution .",

    "normally one aims at using parametric resonance in order to modulate the condensate density by means of a relatively small periodic perturbation .",

    "in this section we suggest a way to shape the overall phase by modulating the trap with a small amplitude for a short time .      to illustrate the effect of the perturbation on the phase of a quasicondensate , we numerically solve the 1d gross - pitaevskii equation for different initial conditions .",

    "resonances between different modes may appear when @xmath114 where @xmath115 . in order to observe resonances",

    "<S> quasi one dimensional bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in elongated traps exhibit significant phase fluctuations even at very low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> we present recent experimental results on the dynamic transformation of phase fluctuations into density modulations during time - of - flight and show the excellent quantitative agreement with the theoretical prediction . </S>",
    "<S> in addition we confirm that under our experimental conditions , in the magnetic trap density modulations are strongly suppressed even when the phase fluctuates . </S>",
    "<S> the paper also discusses our theoretical results on control of the condensate phase by employing a time - dependent perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> our results set important limitations on future applications of bec in precision atom interferometry and atom optics , but at the same time suggest pathways to overcome these limitations .    </S>",
