    "in 1952 , turing proposed that the formation of spatial patterns during morphogenesis could be explained in terms of the instability of a homogeneous steady - state solution of a reaction - diffusion network describing the evolution of a set of morphogens @xcite . turing himself illustrated his ideas on two chemical models . turing s original work",
    "is primarily concerned with the stability analysis of the homogeneous steady - state solution of the rate equations for the interacting morphogens @xcite .",
    "the main point of biological interest , however , is whether stable spatial structures may be generated beyond the instability , i.e. , whether the rate equations admit stable ( and positive ) inhomogeneous solutions exhibiting the most characteristic features of morphogenetic patterns .",
    "this point has been taken up seriously in the early seventies .",
    "more systematic numerical studies of turing s model have been performed showing irregular spatial structures @xcite .",
    "this led to serious reservations about the relevance of turing s theory in developmental biology , particularly its ability to generate regular patterns .",
    "but these criticisms originate from a somewhat unfortunate choice of turing s example and they do not touch the essential points of turing s theory . more specifically ,",
    "the obvious requirement that the rate equations must admit positive and bounded solutions is not satisfied in turing s example @xcite .     because of this misunderstanding on turing s fundamental contribution , other two - variable models satisfying the law of mass action have been explored . in 1968 ,",
    "prigogine and lefever @xcite introduced a two variable system that exhibits an autocatalytic reaction ( called the `` brusselator '' ) .",
    "the simplicity of the rate equations motivated analytical and numerical studies which showed the existence of stable structures @xcite .",
    "the brusselator is based on the following intermediate reactions for the two chemical intermediates @xmath1 and @xmath2 : @xmath3    ( 6.5,3.0)(0.8,0 ) ( 0.16,0.25 ) initial condition was set to @xmath4 , perturbed by a very small random noise .",
    "note the logarithmic scale for time .",
    "initial turing instability triggers a @xmath5 mode at time @xmath6 .",
    "thereafter a coarsening process takes place until there are only two mesas left .",

    "thereafter a coarsening process takes place until there are only two mesas left .",
    "( b ) slow - time oscillatory instability of a single spike solution to ( [ 6dec4:04 ] ) .",
    "the parameter values are @xmath7,title=\"fig:\",width=336 ] ( 1.7,0.1)(a ) ( 5.0,0.1)(b )    the global reaction is @xmath8 and corresponds to the transformation of inputs products @xmath9 and @xmath10 into output products @xmath11 and @xmath12 we assume ( without loss of generality ) that the rate constants for the first and last step are equal to @xmath13 whereas the intermediate rate constants are one .",
    "the rates equations then become @xmath14    in this paper we concentrate on the case where the input and the output reaction steps are slow in comparison to the intermediate steps , so that @xmath13 is small . in the absence of diffusion terms , this implies that the total concentration @xmath15 is a slowly changing quantity .",
    "linear stability reveals the presence of a periodic orbit which arise through a hopf bifurcation of the steady state @xmath16 . in the limit @xmath17 such a periodic orbit",
    "consists of a slow and a fast phase , so that a pulse train can be observed .",
    "there is a large body of literature on the space - independent brusselator ( @xmath18 ) and its extensions . under different assumptions on the parameters ,",
    "the equilibrium state is only marginally stable and an addition of small random perturbations ( or small periodic forcing ) can lead regular to large - amplitude pulses @xcite , @xcite .",
    "other authors have looked at coupled brusselator systems which can exhibit chaos and syncrhonization @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "since the discovery of spatial patterns in 1970 s , various turing patterns in the brusselator were studied both numerically and analytically in one , two and three space dimensions .",
    "these include spots , stripes , labyrinths and and hexagonal patterns @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , oscillatory instabilities and spatio - temporal chaos @xcite , @xcite . while turing analysis and its weakly nonlinear extensions have been successful at detecting and classifying possible pattern types , its range of applicability is limited .",
    "indeed turing patterns are assumed to be small sinusoidal perturbations of a homogeneous state . in practice",
    "however , many patterns are localized and contain sharp transitions such as spikes and kinks . as we will see",
    ", this is particularly the case under the assumption of small @xmath13 . in this paper",
    "we study _ mesa_-type patterns .",
    "these are box - like patterns that join two flat regions of space with sharp transition layers , such as shown in figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "such patterns are not amenable to turing analysis since they are far away from the homogeneous state .    previous mathematical efforts on the formation of localized patterns concentrated on two variable reaction - diffusion models where the dynamics is controlled by the interaction between a slow and a fast variable .",
    "for the brusselator without diffusion terms and with @xmath13 small , the total concentration @xmath15 plays the role of a slow variable . as a result",
    ", localized patterns patterns are expected when diffusion is permitted .    for our analysis",
    "it will be convenient to use the following scaling , @xmath19 where @xmath20 @xmath21 and the spatial domain is @xmath22 $ ] with the zero flux boundary conditions @xmath23    in this work we assume the following conditions , @xmath24 in terms of our scaling we have @xmath25 @xmath26    as a motivation , let us present two numerical examples . on figure [ fig : turing].a we show a typical time evolution over a very long time interval .",
    "the homogeneous steady state is unstable because of turing instability but the expected turing sinusoidal pattern only appears after a delay ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "turing s structure then gradually deteriorates and relatively quickly moves into a new pattern formed by several localized mesa - type structures .",
    "they then undergo a coarsening process over a logarthmically long time - scale and , eventually , only two mesas remain .",
    "turing s analysis can be used to predict the first pattern ( @xmath6 ) but it can not anticipate the coarsening process or the number of final mesas . as we shall demonstrate , in the case @xmath28 , the turing pattern is characterized by a wave number proportional to @xmath29 while the number of stable long - time mesas has the order @xmath30 , so that @xmath31 is logarithmically bigger than @xmath0 .",
    "this is the underlying cause of the coarsening process observed in figure [ fig : turing].a .    in the second experiment shown in figure [ fig : turing].b ,",
    "a single mesa undergoes a `` breather''-type oscillatory instability which eventually leads to its extinction .",
    "both coarsening and the breather instability occur at a slow timescale .",
    "the main goal of this work is to describe these instabilities analytically .",
    "our results are related to the study of bistable systems , see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "mesa patterns also appear in the fitzhugh - nagumo model @xcite , certain phase separation models such as cahn - hilliard , allen - cahn , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and block - copolymers @xcite . for these systems",
    "the resulting spectral problem has small eigenvalues , also called critical spectra , that tend to zero with the thickness of the interfaces .",
    "typically @xmath31 such layers are stable @xcite .",
    "however as we show in this paper , if the number of layers is excessively large , instabilities can occur .",
    "this happens when the exponentially small interaction outside the interface locations can not be ignored .",
    "our main new contribution is to study this interaction , and to show that it has a destabilizing effect .",

    "this leads to the following _ necessary condition _ for the turing instability to appear:@xmath362 provided this condition is satisfied , we have @xmath363 for all @xmath364 therefore turing instability will occur iff @xmath365 in particular the second necessary condition is that @xmath366 in this case , the most unstable mode is of the same order as the minimum of @xmath367 , @xmath368 shortly after the turing instability is triggered , localized mesa - type structures appear due to the presence of steep gradients . in this regime , turing instability can not predict the final number @xmath0 of mesas . indeed , we have @xmath369 where@xmath370 with @xmath371 as obtained in theorem [ thm : huged ] .",

    "this occurs when @xmath385 ( i.e. @xmath386 ) with @xmath387 a more difficult question is whether one can find a regime in which both are _ unstable _ , and the system iterates between the two . here",
    "we consider the case where @xmath67 satisfies ( [ 9mar14:03 ] ) . in this regime",
    "the instability of a single mesa solution can only occur when @xmath59 is near 1 .",
    "then ( [ 11mar11:03 ] ) and ( [ 11mar11:04 ] ) together imply that @xmath388 so we set:@xmath389 from the condition @xmath390 we obtain @xmath391 and we suppose that a single mode @xmath392 is unstable .",
    "the condition @xmath393 then leads , to leading order:@xmath394 so that to leading order,@xmath395 from where@xmath396 on the other hand , we have @xmath397 and we have @xmath398 so that from theorem [ thm : hopf ] we obtain @xmath399 therefore the instability of a mesa can not follow the turing instability since @xmath400",
    "in section [ sec:5 ] we were able to determine the instability thresholds without actually computing the eigenvalues ; but simply by showing the existence of an asymmetric pattern bifurcating from a fold point .",
    "it is an open problem to find the full expression for the eigenvalues near this threshold .",
    "this would give a theoretical timescale for each of the step in the coarsening process .",
    "we expect that the unstable eigenvalue will decrease exponentially in the distance between the mesas .",
    "this would explain the exponential time increase between the successive coarsening events , as observed in figure [ fig : turing].a    in theorem [ thm : hopf ] under condition ( [ 9mar14:03 ] ) we have shown that as @xmath59 is decreased near 1 , the first eigenvalue to cross the imaginary axis is @xmath264 , whose eigenfunction is even .",
    "this corresponds to a `` breather''-type instability shown on figure [ fig : turing].b .",
    "an open question is whether there exists a regime for which other eigenvalues undergo a hopf bifurcation before the @xmath264 eigenvalue . for the gray - scott model",
    "it is known that a single spike can undergo a hopf bifurcation due to a slow translational instability  which corresponds to an odd eigenfunction  whereby the center of the spike oscillates periodically @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the analogy of this phenomenon for a single mesa of the brusselator would be the hopf bifurcation of the @xmath401 eigenvalue .",
    "one can also imagine spike - type solutions for the brusselator simply by taking the limit @xmath402 or equivalently , @xmath403 it is an open problem to study this regime",
    ".    it would be interesting to study the slow dynamics of the mesas , of which there are several types , corresponding to different eigenvalues .",
    "the first type is the slow translational motion of the mesa such as seen in figure [ fig:3 ] after time @xmath404 .",
    "similar motion has been analysed for the fitzhugh - nagumo model on an infinite line @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the brusselator however , the fitzhugh - nagumo model does not have a mass conservation constraint @xmath405 derived in proposition [ prop:1 ] , and does not undergo a coarsening process .",
    "in this sense the brusselator resembles more the cahn - hilliard model or the allen - cahn model with mass constraint @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however unlike the cahn - hilliard model , the brusselator does not have a variational formulation , and the mass conservation is only asymptotically valid .",
    "we remark that a similar phenomenon was also studied for gray scott and gierer - meinhardt models in the context of spike solutions @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a second type of slow instability is the mass exchange that occurs prior to mesa annhiliation as seen in figure [ fig:3 ] at time @xmath406 .",
    "this phenomenon also occurs in some flame - propagation problems @xcite , @xcite and in the keller - segel model @xcite , where an exchange of mass takes place between two boundary spikes , and eventually leads to an annihilation of one of them .",
    "the coarsening process in the brusselator terminates when there are @xmath407 mesas left , where @xmath68 is the characteristic width of the interface .",
    "this is in contrast to the the cahn - hilliard model , where the coarsening proceeds until all but one interface remains @xcite .",
    "localized structures far from the turing regime are commonplace in reaction - diffusion systems such as the brusselator , and provide an alternative pattern - formation mechanism to turing instability .",
    "these structures appear whenever the turing instability band is very large or when the diffusivity ratio of the activator and inhibitor is large .",
    "as we demonstrate in this work , turing analysis can not explain the diverse phenomena that can occur in this regime , such as coarsening and the `` breather''-type instabilities .",
    "however singular perturbation tools can be successfully applied to asnwer many of these questions .",
