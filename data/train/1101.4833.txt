    "in order to determine the dependence of line luminosity on the thermal continuum in a quasar , we constructed a sample of sdss dr7 radio quiet quasars with @xmath1 and spectra with a median s / n @xmath5 7 , this yielded 10069 agns .",
    "long slit spectroscopy of radio loud agn often show strong regions of narrow line emission on scales as large as @xmath6 100 kpc that tend to be aligned with the jet direction @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of this contribution to the narrow line luminosity is largely unknown @xcite .",
    "therefore , we segregated out the radio loud quasars because there is a concern that jet propagation can enhance the line strengths .",
    "the sdss dr7 data was cross - referenced to the first data base .",
    "the radio loudness , @xmath7 , is usually defined as a 5 ghz flux density 10 times larger than the @xmath8 flux density , @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "so any first flux density detection or upper limit that implied @xmath10 was considered radio quiet with 1.4 ghz flux density used instead of 5 ghz flux density .",
    "we also eliminated the low ionization broad absorption line quasars from our sample since they are known to have anomalously weak [ oiii]@xmath45007 and [ oii]@xmath43727 emission lines @xcite . in the end , there were 6904 radio quiet sources remaining in our sample .",
    "the spectral data of h@xmath2 and mg ii regime were separately reduced using the procedures of @xcite which see for further details , and we will only briefly outline it here . to measure the h@xmath2 line and the [ oiii]@xmath45007 line , a single power - law fit to the optical continuum in the restframe wavelength range @xmath11 was obtained taking into account contributions from both broad and narrow fe ii multiplets that were modeled using the i zw 1 templates provided by @xcite . the h@xmath2 emission lines are modeled as multiple gaussians : at most four broad gaussians and one narrow gaussian with fwhm @xmath12 900 km @xmath13 for h@xmath2 , and one or two gaussians for each [ oiii]@xmath44959,5007 . to measure the mg ii line ,",
    "we fit the continuum from the several continuum windows in the restframe wavelength range 2200 - 3500 , after subtracting the estimated uv feii contributions by the fe ii template generated by @xcite and the balmer continuum using the method by @xcite .",
    "each of the two mg ii doublet lines is modeled with one broad five - parameter gauss - hermite series component and one single gaussian narrow component .",
    "furthermore , the broad components of the doublet lines are set to have the same profile .",
    "the narrow components are set to fwhm @xmath12 900 km @xmath13 and flux @xmath12 10% of the total mg ii flux .",
    "finally , we fit the spectrum in the [ oii ] regime using one gaussian for [ oii ] emission and a single power - law for optical continuum in the restframe wavelength range 3600 - 3800 .",
    "this process resulted in five pieces of relevant information for every quasar :    * the optical / uv continuum luminosity from 5100 @xmath14 to 3000 @xmath14 , @xmath15 * the luminosity of the broad component of h@xmath2 @xmath44861 , @xmath16 * the luminosity of the broad component of mg ii @xmath42798 , @xmath17 * the luminosity of the narrow line [ oiii ] @xmath45007 , @xmath18 * the luminosity of the narrow line [ oii ] @xmath43727 , @xmath19      +",
    "the blue continuum luminosity is the most basic signature of the thermal emission from the quasar , so it is the most commonly used quantity for estimating @xmath0 .",
    "perhaps the most popular bolometric correction is the simple one proposed by @xcite , @xmath20 . clearly , using a portion of the optical / uv continuum",
    "is more accurate than a single point and we have that at our disposal , @xmath15 .",
    "for example , a single point could lie in a noisy end of the sdss spectrum .",
    "the average spectral index in our sample of 6904 quasars , from 5100 @xmath14 to 3000 @xmath14 , is @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is defined in terms of the spectral luminosity as @xmath23 .",
    "this spectral slope implies that the @xcite bolometric correction can be expressed as @xmath24 equation ( 1 ) is relatively insensitive to the choice of @xmath25 , with only a few percent change in the constant of proportionality as @xmath25 varies from 0.45 to 0.7 .",
    "figure 1 shows how well the line strengths represent the continuum luminosity with the factor of 15 bolometric correction from equation ( 1 ) .",
    "the linear fits in log - log space are given by equations ( 2 ) - ( 5 ) with the standard errors for the intercept and the slope @xmath26\\;,\\\\ & & \\log(l_{bol})= 16.76\\pm 0.26 + ( 0.68\\pm 0.01)\\log[l_{mgii}]\\;,\\\\ & & \\log(l_{bol})= 26.50\\pm 0.32 + ( 0.46\\pm 0.01)\\log[l_{oiii}]\\;,\\\\ & & \\log(l_{bol})= 33.96\\pm 0.33 + ( 0.29\\pm0.01)\\log[l_{oii}]\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the coefficients of determination , @xmath27 , are shown on the plots .",
    "the h@xmath2 fit is the best , followed closely by mg ii with the narrow line fits considerably worse .",
    "figure 1 confirms the implications of @xcite that @xmath18 represents @xmath15 more reliably than @xmath19 does .",
    "we also plot archival estimators of @xmath0 from the literature to show the improvement obtained by these more rigorous calibrations of the data .",
    "it appears that the @xcite normalization is considerably higher than what has been used for line strength based estimates in the past .",
    "a 5100 @xmath14 estimator based on the composite of @xcite , @xmath28 , is closer , but still considerably larger than the normalization of the archival line strength based estimates .",
    "the @xcite estimator ( which is about 65% of the @xcite value ) seems to match the normalization of the line strength based estimates the best .",
    "however , the poor archival fits are not just a consequence of the normalization , but the slope of the fits as well .",
    "if the normalization were adjusted , the @xcite fit for h@xmath2 would be fairly accurate .",
    "there is no unique criteria for the quality of the estimator and this must be determined by each researcher per their requirements .",
    "we choose a `` factor of two '' as a figure of merit ( i.e. @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the estimated continuum luminosity ) for illustrative purposes .",
    "the h@xmath2 based estimate is excellent with 97.4% of the estimates accurate to within a factor of two .",
    "the other estimators are accurate to within a factor of two in the following order , mg ii , [ o iii ] , [ o ii ] ; 90.1% , 80.3% and 73.9% of the time , respectively .",
    "the results are presented graphically in figure 2 as the probability distribution ( histogram ) of the ratio of estimated luminosity to measured continuum luminosity , @xmath31 .",
    "there are 2461 quasars in the sdss dr7 sample , @xmath1 , with a first detection and radio loudness , @xmath32 .",
    "we use this sample as a test - bed for the application of the estimators that were derived in the last section .",
    "we can check our calibrations of the bolometric correction by applying equations ( 2 ) to ( 5 ) to each line individually and comparing the resultant @xmath30 to @xmath15 .",
    "the results are presented in figure 3 as the probability distribution ( histogram ) of the ratio of estimated luminosity to measured continuum luminosity , @xmath31 .",
    "our `` factor of two '' figure of merit ( i.e. @xmath29 ) indicates that the h@xmath2 based estimate is still excellent with 94.9% of the estimates accurate to within a factor of two .",
    "the other estimators are accurate to within a factor of two in the following order , mg ii , [ o iii ] , [ o ii ] ; 86.2% , 75.1% and 67.5% of the time , respectively .",
    "figure 3 shows that estimators based on the [ oii ] and [ oiii ] emission line strengths have a propensity to over estimate the continuum luminosity in radio loud quasars .",
    "this is in contrast to the radio quiet quasars in figure 2 , where the more errant estimates are equally likely to occur above or below `` 1 '' . in other words ,",
    "[ o iii ] and [ o ii ] are often much stronger than expected from the continuum luminosity alone .",
    "the implication is that the excess narrow line strength is produced by the aforementioned excited gas that is often observed aligned with the radio jets and is therefore likely to be energized by the jet @xcite .",
    "we also performed the same exercise with a cutoff at @xmath33 .",
    "the results were very similar to those above , indicating that the definition of radio loudness is a negligible factor in this analysis .",
    "we give an example of how the line strengths can be used to analyze radio loud agn , the blazar 3c 216 .",
    "we retrieve the line strengths from @xcite . for h@xmath2 , mg ii , [ o iii ] and [ o ii ] , from equations ( 2 ) - ( 5 )",
    ", these line strengths yield the following estimates for @xmath34 , @xmath35 ergs / sec , @xmath36 ergs / sec , @xmath37 ergs / sec , @xmath38 ergs / sec , respectively .",
    "3c 216 is argued to be the one of the most kinetically dominated known quasars , with a jet power ( kinetic luminosity ) to @xmath0 ratio @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the broad line estimates are in good agreement , but the narrow line estimates are much larger .",
    "the results of this paper indicate that the broad lines are therefore excellent estimators of the continuum luminosity and the narrow lines are dominated by a jet contribution .",
    "we have derived line strength based estimators for @xmath0 for radio quiet quasars from the broad components of h@xmath2 , mg ii , and the narrow lines , [ o iii ] and [ o ii ] in equations ( 2 ) -(5 ) .",
    "the strength of the broad component of h@xmath2 is a superior estimator of @xmath15 for either radio quiet or radio loud quasars since it is accurate to within a factor of two , 97.4% and 94.9% of time , respectively . the next best line strength based estimators are in order of accuracy , mg ii , [ o iii ] and [ o ii ] .",
    "we applied our results to radio loud quasars and found strong evidence that the narrow line based estimates are often skewed by what is likely a strong jet induced contribution . it was also demonstrated that using all four line strengths in tandem can be a useful diagnostic tool for studying the jet power , environment and accretion power in agn .",
    "the results of this letter are applicable to blazars , but perhaps not to nlrgs and seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "there is compelling evidence that sometimes the same gas that can attenuate the nucleus in these sources can also attenuate the narrow line emission @xcite . in general , without additional information , one does not know if the narrow line region in a particular seyfert 2 galaxy or nlrg is attenuated or not , thus the [ o iii ] and [ o ii ] based estimators are not reliable in isolation .",
    "we showed in section 4 that the narrow line estimators are actually useful in the blazar context , where attenuation is not an issue .",
    "in general , narrow line based estimators are most useful if complemented by other information such as broad line luminosity or the actual continuum luminosity . for nlrgs and seyfert 2 galaxies ,",
    "the ir continuum luminosity is a valuable complement to the narrow line strengths since it is not believed to be attenuated @xcite .",
