    "radial gradients in the abundances of elements such as oxygen , nitrogen , and sulphur have long been observed in the disk of the milky way @xcite , as well as in the disks of many nearby spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "the gas - phase abundances of these elements in  regions are relatively straightforward to determine on the basis of their bright emission - line ratios ( see the review by @xcite ) .",
    "analyses by @xcite and others have revealed interesting correlations between the slope of these abundance gradients , and global galaxy characteristics . a variety of mechanisms have been proposed to account for the fact that the inner regions of spiral galaxies are generally more metal - rich than the outer parts , including ongoing infall of metal - poor gas , and radial inflow of enriched gas .",
    "the presence of a bar has been shown to homogenise the abundances somewhat , resulting in a flatter abundance profile than in a non - barred galaxy of similar hubble type @xcite .",
    "since oxygen is a primary element produced in massive stars , its abundance is a useful measure of the _ cumulative _ massive star formation rate . in order to build up a proper star formation",
    "_ history _",
    "however , it is necessary to be able to measure the relative abundances of other elements such as iron and magnesium , which are produced in different types of stars and released into the interstellar medium on different characteristic timescales .",
    "abundance determinations from absorption line studies of these elements are commonplace for stars in our own galaxy ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) ; in the integrated light of elliptical galaxies , bulges , and extragalactic globular clusters ( e.g. huchra et al .",
    "1996 ; trager et al . 1998 ; cohen , blakeslee , & c^ ot ' e 2003 ) ; and as a function of radius for inner galactic regions ( raimann et al . 2001",
    "; jablonka , gorgas , & goudfrooij 2002 ; proctor & sansom 2002 ; worthey 2004 ) .",
    "however , such measurements become much more difficult in galactic disks , due to the fact that the surface brightness of the unresolved stellar population ( against which a weak absorption feature must be measured ) is much lower .",
    "fortunately , interference filter imaging offers almost an _ order of magnitude _ gain in effective signal - to - noise over a long - slit spectrograph of the same resolution , as demonstrated by @xcite and moll ' a , hardy & beauchamp ( 1999 ) . despite a modest telescope aperture , and the need for expensive , custom - made filters with broader bandpasses than one would like ( @xmath1 , to be able to cover a useful range in galaxy redshift ) , these pioneering studies have revealed the existence of shallow radial gradients in the mg@xmath2 and fe@xmath3 features in the disks of ngc  4303 , ngc  4321 , and ngc  4535 .    in this paper , we describe the application of narrow - band absorption - line imaging techniques using the wavelength agility , wide field - of - view , and charge - shuffling ability of the taurus tunable filter ( ttf ) at the anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) to almost triple the number of face - on spiral galaxies for which stellar radial abundance gradients have been measured .",
    "we begin by outlining the ttf s characteristics in section  [ method ] , before demonstrating the sensitivity of our technique on stars with a range of known abundances in section  [ stellarobs ] .",
    "our galaxy imaging and surface photometry techniques are presented in sections  [ galobs ] and [ datareductionanalysis ] , and the radial gradients in `` lick / ids '' spectral line indices ( faber et al .",
    "1985 ; worthey et al .",
    "1994 ) in section  [ results ] .",
    "the lick spectral indices do not measure abundances _ per se _ , but can be transformed to quantities like [ fe / h ] via the method of spectral synthesis . in paper  ii ( fenner , gibson & ryder , in preparation ) , we present models and tools for converting between absolute elemental abundances and line indices in the observer s plane , and thus place new constraints on the star formation histories of the galaxies presented here .",
    "the ttf is a tunable fabry - perot interferometer consisting of two highly polished glass plates whose separation is controlled to high accuracy by piezoelectric stacks . unlike most fabry - perot etalons which have resolving powers @xmath4 , the ttf is designed to work at plate separations @xmath5 m or less , delivering @xmath6 , comparable to conventional fixed narrow - band interference filters ( see @xcite and @xcite for summaries of the optical design and practical applications of the ttf ) .",
    "the ttf is mounted in the collimated beam of the taurus  ii focal reducer , and at the f/8 cassegrain focus of the 3.9  m aat delivers a field of view up to 10  arcmin in diameter ( depending on the clear aperture of the blocking filter in use ) .",
    "the eev @xmath74096 ccd detector used for these observations has a scale of 0.33  arcsec  pixel@xmath8 , and a quantum efficiency near 90  percent in the @xmath9  wavelength range .    by enabling an adjustable passband anywhere between 3700 and 10000 ,",
    "the ttf obviates the need for an entire suite of narrow - band filters , and makes possible monochromatic imaging of almost any feature of interest over an expansive redshift range .",
    "another important aspect of our observing method is the use of charge - shuffling synchronised with passband - switching , which overcomes many of the systematic errors which plague conventional narrow - band imaging , while allowing accurate differential measurements under less than ideal observing conditions .      in their work ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite concentrated on the mg@xmath0 and fe5270 features , two of the most prominent `` lick / ids '' indices ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , in part to limit the number of expensive narrow - band filters that would be required .",
    "we chose to image our sample galaxies in these same two lines in order to be consistent with their study and to facilitate comparison with the large body of observational and theoretical work performed with these two indices .",
    "nevertheless , as @xcite point out , these features are susceptible to some contamination by other elements , such as ca and c.    to simplify the transformations from our observed measurements of the absorption line and continuum flux ratios to the lick indices , we have endeavoured to match as closely as possible the original line and continuum bandpass definitions laid down by @xcite .",
    "while selecting the narrowest possible bandpass for the ttf will ensure the maximum contrast between the absorption line core flux and continuum band , the overall signal - to - noise ( s / n ) of each measurement ( and more significantly , of their ratio which defines the index ) will suffer from the reduced throughput . on the other hand , the broadest bandpass will improve the throughput , but at the expense of diluting the absorption feature . because narrowing the gap between the plates in order to broaden the passband risks irreparable damage to the plates",
    "should their coatings come into contact with each other , we opted for a minimum plate spacing of 2.5  microns , which yields a lorentzian passband with full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) @xmath10  at 5100 . this is four times narrower than the fixed filters employed by @xcite , and being of the same order as the equivalent widths of the mg@xmath0 and fe5270 features , is a good compromise between",
    "contrast and s / n .",
    "like all fabry - perot etalons , the ttf has a periodic transmission profile , with a finesse @xmath11 , i.e. an inter - order spacing of @xmath12 the instrumental fwhm .",
    "thus , to ensure only a single order of the ttf reaches the detector , we require a blocking filter with @xmath13 , but broad enough to contain the full mg@xmath0 and fe5270 passbands . unfortunately , none of the existing ttf blocking filters meets both these requirements , and the f126 blocking filter we used , a 380  fwhm interference filter centred on 5220 , was not ideal . as fig .",
    "[ stellarscan_fig ] shows , the blue continuum of the mg@xmath0 feature lies just outside the blue cutoff of the f126 filter , while the transmission peaks at barely 70  percent , and varies by up to 35  percent over just 100 .",
    "in addition , the clear aperture of just 63  mm limits the usable field of view to about 6  arcmin in diameter . nevertheless , as we show in the following sections , this blocking filter adequately met the goals of this project . to cover the blue continuum of the mg@xmath0 feature",
    ", we used the ttf s b4 blocking filter , with a fwhm = 320  centred on 5000 , a clear aperture of 122  mm , and a peak throughput of 76  percent .",
    "the plate separation and parallelism in the ttf is set by three piezoelectric stacks , and servo - stabilised against drifting by a capacitance bridge .",
    "tuning to the desired wavelength is performed by fine adjustment of the plate separation through a queensgate instruments cs100 controller . in order to define the relationship between a given plate separation ( @xmath14 , in analog - to - digital units ) and central wavelength of the ttf passband ( @xmath15 , in  )",
    ", we illuminate the ttf uniformly with an arc lamp , and record the lamp spectrum while scanning the ttf progressively in wavelength . for the region of interest ( @xmath16 ) , a combination of deuterium , helium , and neon lamps yielded sufficient lines for this purpose .",
    "as noted by @xcite , at plate separations @xmath17  microns the multi - layer coating thickness becomes a significant fraction of the actual plate spacing .",
    "since the depth within the coatings where reflection occurs is wavelength - dependent , the net effect is that the relation between @xmath14 and @xmath15 is no longer linear as it is for larger plate spacings ( or equivalently , narrower bandpasses ) .",
    "indeed , we found it necessary to apply a quadratic ( second order ) fit to the @xmath18 relation . incorrectly assuming a linear relation could result in the passband being offset by the equivalent of the fwhm at the extreme wavelength settings",
    "in order to derive a function for converting absorption line - strengths measured with the ttf into the lick / ids system , we applied our technique to 31 lick standard stars for which mg@xmath0 and fe5270 indices are available in worthey et  al .",
    "these stars spanned a broad range in metallicity , and thus in their lick indices .",
    "stars were imaged at @xmath196@xmath20 intervals in a wavelength range from a minimum of either 5100@xmath20 or 4870@xmath21 to a maximum 5400@xmath21 , with the ttf set to a bandpass of fwhm @xmath1917@xmath21 . in this way , a low - resolution spectrum was built - up from the series of individual images for each star .",
    "each stellar image was trimmed , bias corrected , and flux within a fixed aperture measured using tasks within the iraf package .    figure  [ stellarscan_fig ] compares a ttf spectral scan ( _ solid line _ ) for the star hd131977 against a coud feed stellar spectrum of the same star ( found at _ the indo - u.s .",
    "library of coud feed stellar spectra _",
    "home page at http://www.noao.edu/cflib/ ) , degraded to match the resolution of the ttf data ( _ dotted line _ ) .",
    "the ttf spectrum has been corrected for the transmission profiles of the f126 and b4 blocking filters ( described in section  [ blockingfilters ] ) .",
    "the filter transmission profiles ( _ dashed lines _ ) were obtained by dividing our ttf spectral scans of the flux standards hr7596 and hr5501 by the flux calibrated spectra from @xcite .",
    "the alignment between the spectral features seen in the ttf scan and those of the coud feed spectrum confirms that the quadratic @xmath18 relation described in section  [ wave_calib ] leads to good wavelength calibration .",
    "the location of the lorentzian profiles shown in fig .",
    "[ stellarscan_fig ] indicates the central wavelengths of the mg@xmath0 and fe5270 absorption features and the corresponding red and blue continua , as defined by @xcite .",

    "thick horizontal lines indicate the lick bandpasses.,width=328 ]    the full stellar spectral scans provide a means for checking not just the wavelength calibration , but just as importantly , in gauging the sensitivity of this imaging technique to spectral features .",
    "however , the mg@xmath0 and fe5270 indices were not calculated from the full spectral scans .",
    "instead , they were derived using only the images at the ( velocity - corrected ) line and continuum wavelengths , since this is the technique to be applied to the galaxies .",
    "instrumental indices were calculated from the following expressions ( @xmath22 @xcite ) :    @xmath23}\\ ] ]    @xmath24\\ ] ]    where @xmath25 and @xmath26 denotes the sky - subtracted , filter profile - corrected flux at the mg@xmath0 and fe5270 line wavelengths , respectively , and @xmath27 is the fwhm of the lorentzian bandpass .",
    "the continuum flux , @xmath28 , is given by :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 , and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the sky - subtracted , filter profile - corrected flux at the red and blue continua , respectively .",
    "we varied the weighting given to the red and blue continua and found that the strongest correlation between our ttf indices and the lick values was obtained by using the red continuum only ( i.e. @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) .",
    "table  [ lickfit_table ] presents the gradients , y - intercepts , associated errors and chi - squared values for the fit between ttf and lick fe5270 indices obtained using only the red continuum ( column 3 ) , only the blue continuum ( column 4 ) , and with equal weighting ( column 5 ) .",
    "table  [ lickfit_table ] only shows the @xmath33 case for mg@xmath0 ( column 2 ) because our spectral scans only extended down to @xmath194870@xmath21 for about half of the stars ; however this case gave the best fit .",
    "the deterioration of the fit for the fe5270 feature upon inclusion of the blue continuum flux is largely due to our non - standard technique for obtaining line core and continuum flux levels , which is more sensitive to the gradient in the spectrum than the lick / ids technique .",
    "the lick / ids fe5270 blue continuum bandpass covers a narrow wavelength range , just blueward of the absorption feature , that best represents the true continuum level ( see the thick horizontal lines in fig .  [ stellarscan_fig ] ) . by comparison ,",
    "the lick / ids line and red continuum bandpasses are 2.1@xmath352.7 times wider than that for the blue continuum . as evident from fig .",
    "[ stellarscan_fig ] , the broad wings of our lorentzian transmission profile makes the blue continuum flux measured by the ttf sensitive to the shape and gradient of the spectrum around the 5220@xmath355260  range .",
    "better results would be expected if the ttf passband could be narrowed when switching from line to blue continuum wavelengths .",
    "however , it was not possible to alter the filter s plate spacings during charge - shuffle operations",
    ".    in the case of mg@xmath0 , observing the blue continuum introduces further complications .",
    "firstly , measuring mg@xmath36 involves changing from the f126 to the b4 blocking filter .",
    "since filters could not be switched while in charge - shuffle mode , one would lose some of the advantage of this differential observing technique to average over temporal variations in air mass and photometric conditions during exposures . secondly ,",
    "the blue continuum range of @xmath37 , as defined by worthey et  al .",
    "( 1994 ) , is contaminated in many active galaxies by [ oiii ]  @xmath38 emission .",
    "our sample of eight galaxies contains three seyferts , for which this [ oiii ] emission is likely to contribute to the flux in the mg@xmath39 images . for these reasons , and considering the fit parameters shown in table  [ lickfit_table ] , the value @xmath40 in equations [ lick_mg_eq ] and [ lick_fe_eq ] , was determined exclusively from red continuum images for both mg@xmath0 and fe5270 .",
