    "finding the eigenvalues of unitary transformations or self - adjoint operators is a central task in quantum mechanics . the thermodynamic and dynamical properties of a quantum system",
    "are determined by the spectrum of a hamiltonian and the corresponding unitary transformations .",
    "furthermore the estimation of eigenvalues is an important tool in quantum computation ( see @xcite ) .",
    "for that reason the algorithm for _ phase estimation _ has been developed ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we rephrase it as follows .",
    "we have a hilbert space @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the _ target _ register where the considered unitary @xmath0 acts on and an ancilla register @xmath4 consisting of @xmath5 qubits if an accuracy of the eigenvalues of @xmath0 of the order @xmath6 is desired . assume the target register to be in an eigenstate @xmath7 of @xmath0 with eigenvalue @xmath8 .",
    "initialize the ancilla register in an equal superposition of all its logical states , i.e. , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the binary number corresponding to the @xmath5 ancilla qubits @xmath11 . on the joint hilbert space @xmath2 apply for all @xmath12 the transformations @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the projectors onto the @xmath16 and @xmath17 state of the ancilla qubit @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "the operation @xmath19 is the @xmath20-fold iteration of @xmath0 .",
    "if @xmath3 is in the state @xmath21 then @xmath22 is converted into the state @xmath23 by the ` kick - back - effect ' @xcite .",
    "after fourier transformation on @xmath4 we obtain @xmath24 i.e. , the probability distribution is peaked around @xmath25 . if @xmath7 is not an eigenstate of @xmath0 , than the algorithm will project approximatively ( in the limit of large @xmath5 ) onto any of the eigenstates @xcite .",
    "if the initial state on @xmath3 is a density matrix which is diagonal in the basis of @xmath0 , one will obtain any of the eigenvalues of @xmath0 with the corresponding probability .    at first sight",
    ", quantum phase estimation seems to be applicable for finding energy values and eigenstates of an unknown hamiltonian of an arbitrary quantum system simply by setting @xmath26 .",
    "this would be interesting for the investigation of complex physical systems . to measure eigenvalues of interaction hamiltonians in many - spin systems , as molecules or solid states , for instance ,",
    "would be rather useful .",
    "but there is a severe problem which is essentially that quantum phase estimation does _ not _ use the implementation of @xmath0 as a _ black box _ subroutine .",
    "it uses the _ conditional _ transformations @xmath27 ( see eq .",
    "( [ vau ] ) ) as black boxes and one should emphasize that no canonical conversion procedure building @xmath27 from @xmath0 is known if @xmath0 is a black box .",
    "sometimes this fact is hidden by using a language too classical if one explains the action of @xmath27 by claiming that it implements @xmath0 ( or its iterations ) if the corresponding ancilla qubit is in the logical state @xmath17 .",
    "this hides the fact that a superposition state of the ancilla has to lead to a superposition of the two actions ` implementation of @xmath0 ' and ` no implementation ' .",
    "imagine that the black box implementing @xmath0 contains a memory storing the information whether @xmath0 is implemented or not .",
    "then such a superposition of implementation is destroyed by the memory . however , in @xcite we have shown that the unitary evolution @xmath0 can in principle be conjugated by other unitary transformations in such a way that the net effect is a ` controlled-@xmath0 ' .",
    "but the class of unitary transformations @xmath0 considered there is only the evolutions according to @xmath28-qubit pair - interaction hamiltonians . here",
    "we address the question how to use quantum phase estimation for obtaining information about the spectrum of @xmath0 if we have no prior information about @xmath0 at all .",
    "we show that it is at least possible to get the autocorrelation function of the spectrum of @xmath0 , or , speaking more explicitly , the spectrum of @xmath1 , provided that the following assumptions are true :    1 .",
    "the operation @xmath0 is implementable on a system @xmath3 which can be brought into interaction with another register @xmath29 of equal hilbert space dimension in such a way that complete exchange of quantum information between @xmath3 and @xmath29 is possible .",
    "if @xmath30 for an appropriate @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the real hamiltonian of the system @xmath3 we assume that this exchange of information can either be done on a small time scale compared to the evolution according to @xmath32 or the natural evolution can be switched off during the implementation of this information exchange .",
    "2 .   there is another quantum register @xmath33 with the same dimension as @xmath3 and @xmath29 and an ancilla register @xmath4 consisting of @xmath5 bits if the desired accuracy for the eigenvalues is @xmath34 .",
    "3 .   on the system",
    "@xmath35 we have a set of quantum transformations available which is universal for quantum computation .",
    "of course the assumption that the unknown hamiltonian @xmath32 can be switched off is problematic , but if additional prior information about the structure of @xmath32 is available , standard decoupling techniques @xcite can be used . note",
    "that assumption 1 is considerably weaker than the assumption that @xmath32 can be switched on and off by the quantum state of an ancilla qubit .",
    "the essential part of our algorithm is rather simple in contrast to @xcite for the cost that we obtain eigenvectors and eigenvalues of @xmath36 instead of those of @xmath0 .",
    "it consists of a conjugation of @xmath0 by known unitary transformations in such a way that the net effect is the conditional transformation @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are states of the ancilla qubit @xmath18 .",
    "one can see easily that the effect on the ancilla s states is the same if the unconditional unitary @xmath40 is implemented on @xmath33 after each implementation of @xmath41 .",
    "this implements the conditional transformation @xmath42    using standard phase estimation we can use @xmath43 for obtaining eigenvalues of @xmath1 .",
    "the procedure for implementing @xmath44 consists of the following steps for @xmath11 .    1 .",
    "implement state exchange of the registers @xmath3 and @xmath29 , i.e. , the unitary @xmath45 with @xmath46 .",
    "2 .   implement @xmath19 on @xmath3 . if @xmath30 , i.e. , if @xmath47 is the unitary evolution according to the system hamiltonian @xmath32 , then one has to wait the time @xmath48 .",
    "3 .   implement state exchange of @xmath3 and @xmath29 again .",
    "steps 1 - 3 implement the transformation @xmath49 on the register @xmath29 .",
    "4 .   implement a _",
    "conditional _ exchange of the states of @xmath29 and @xmath33 depending on the state of qubit @xmath18 in the ancilla state , i.e. we implement @xmath50 on @xmath51 .",
    "the conditional exchange can easily be implemented , if the registers @xmath29 and @xmath33 consist of qubits . in this case",
    "the conditioned permutation of two corresponding qubits is a usual fredkin - gate @xcite .",
    "our algorithm might have applications for investigating the spectrum of a many - particle hamiltonian in solid - state physics , since the spectrum and its gaps determines dynamical and thermo - dynamical behavior of the system @xcite .",
    "of course for many - particle systems it is not possible to find the complete set of eigenvalues of @xmath52 since the dimension of @xmath3 grows exponentially . but",
    "periodicities in the spectrum of @xmath32 could be found .",
    "we sketch this idea .",
    "first we assume that @xmath53 is chosen in such a way that @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is an upper bound on the difference between the largest and smallest eigenvalue of @xmath32 given by prior knowledge .",
    "assume that @xmath29 and @xmath33 are prepared in the same initial density matrix @xmath56 .",
    "the state @xmath56 defines a probability measure on @xmath57 by setting @xmath58 if @xmath59 is no eigenvalue of @xmath47 and @xmath60 else .",
    "if @xmath56 is the maximally mixed state and the dimension of @xmath3 is large such that the probability measure can approximatively described by a probability density , this measure is known as the _ density of states _ @xcite . running the algorithm several times allows to estimate the density of eigenstates of @xmath61 which is the autocorrelation function of the density of eigenstates of @xmath32 .",
    "if this density contains periodicities , for instance when there are spectral gaps with equal distances , they can be detected by using our algorithm .",
    "note that in solid - state physics , for instance , energy gaps occur which do not depend on @xmath28 .",
    "hence the size of the required ancilla register does not necessarily grow with @xmath28 for detecting interesting gaps .",
    "thanks to p. wocjan for useful remarks .",
