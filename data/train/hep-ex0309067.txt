    "the decay mode @xmath3 is analogous to the mode @xmath4 , which has been studied extensively in view of cp violation measurements . in these two decay modes ,",
    "the cp asymmetry predicted by the standard model is very small , and the observation of a sizeable effect would be a clear signal of physics beyond the standard model .    the decay channel @xmath3 can be used to measure various parameters in the @xmath5-meson system . in the atlas experiment , assuming an integrated luminosity of 30  fb@xmath6 , roughly 10 000 decays can be reconstructed with a signal - to - background ratio of about 1:1 , as will be shown later in this paper .",
    "it can be thus foreseen that the measurement of the branching fraction of this mode , the measurement of the @xmath5 lifetime , as well as other measurements will be feasible , which constitues an important cross - check of other measurements performed using other decay channels .",
    "moreover , the decay mode @xmath3 , when combined with its u - spin symmetric channel , @xmath7 , provides a new strategy for the extraction of the @xmath8 angle of the unitarity triangle  @xcite .",
    "indeed , while the phase @xmath9 is ckm suppressed for the decay mode @xmath3 , this is not the case for the decay mode @xmath7 .",
    "cp violation effects could thus potentially be more easily accessible through the latter mode by measuring the time - dependent asymmetry of @xmath10 .",
    "the overall normalization can be fixed by measuring cp averaged rates of @xmath7 and @xmath3 , which assumes the validity of the u - spin symmetry ( the approximate symmetry of u , d and s quarks ) .",
    "the measurements seem to be , however , out of reach due to the small expected branching ratio of @xmath7 , and the overlapping mass peaks of the @xmath5 and @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath12 system is characterized by two eigenstates with different masses and decay rates .",
    "the experimental determination of the mass difference @xmath13 and the rate difference @xmath14 will be valuable input for flavour dynamics in both the standard model and its possible extensions . while the measurement of @xmath13 has been proven to be accessible through the decays @xmath15 and @xmath16 , @xmath14 is expected to be precisely measured in atlas through the decay channel @xmath4 .",

    "events were further selected to satisfy the atlas second level trigger : the presence of a second muon with @xmath26  gev and @xmath27 .",
    "the resulting signal samples were consisting of about 17,000 @xmath28 events and 15,000 @xmath29 events .",
    "a full geant - based simulation was used to simulate the response of the atlas inner detector and the electromagnetic calorimeter .",
    "the muon chambers were not included in the simulation , but only real muons were included in the analysis .",
    "the muon identification efficiencies were assumed to be 85% for the first muon ( the muon with @xmath20  6 gev ) and 78% for the second muon ( the muon with @xmath20  3 gev ) . the 85% efficiency for the muon with the higher transverse momentum includes both reconstruction and level-1 trigger efficiencies .",
    "the j/@xmath18 was reconstructed by fitting pairs of opposite - charge muons passing the level-2 selection ( @xmath30 ) ( @xmath31 ) is used to indicate a muon with a @xmath20  6 ( 3 ) gev . ] to a common vertex and by calculating their invariant mass . the @xmath32/d.o.f . of the vertex fit",
    "was required to be less than 6.0 , and the decay vertex of the j/@xmath18 was required to be detached from the primary vertex by at least 250  @xmath33 m in the transverse plane .",
    "the j/@xmath18 mass resolution was found to be 39 mev .",
    "the resolution of the j/@xmath18 decay vertex in the transverse plane was 64  @xmath33 m  @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of the reconstruction within a three - standard - deviation mass window was 79% . if a j/@xmath18 was found , the analysis proceeded with @xmath22-reconstruction in the electromagnetic calorimeter .",
    "the @xmath22 reconstruction is described in more detail in ref .",

    "was fitted with two gaussians , and the obtained mass resolution was @xmath34 .",
    "the total reconstruction efficiecny was 2.3@xmath35 within two standard deviations from the nominal mass .    to    the j/@xmath18 and @xmath22 candidates were combined to reconstruct both the @xmath36 and @xmath37",
