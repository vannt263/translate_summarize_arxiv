    "the electric transport in semiconductor superlattices is usually dominated by resonances between the localized energy levels inside the wells resulting in peaks in the current - field relation .",
    "this may yield complicated current - voltage characteristics exhibiting may branches due to the formation of domains of different electric field inside the sample ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these experimental features could be qualitatively reproduced by theoretical models combining rate equations for the transport between the wells and poisson s equation @xcite .",
    "while these approaches assume interwell transition rates which are either fitted or obtained from phenomenological models , we have recently proposed a way to calculate the transport microscopically @xcite .",
    "we obtained good quantitative agreement with the experimental data of ref .",
    "@xcite for highly doped samples , where the scattering from ionized impurities causes a strong broadening of the levels . here",
    "we consider the lower doped sample used in @xcite consisting of a 40 period gaas / alas superlattice ( barrier width @xmath0 nm , well width @xmath1 nm , period @xmath2 , doping @xmath3@xmath4 per well , cross section @xmath5 @xmath4 ) and investigate the impact of interface roughness which both contributes to the broadening and causes nonresonant transitions between the wells .",
    "in the case of weakly coupled quantum wells the appropriate basis set is a product of wannier functions @xmath6 of subband @xmath7 localized in well @xmath8 , and plane waves @xmath9 . here",
    "the @xmath10 direction is the growth direction and @xmath11 are vectors within the @xmath12 plane . restricting ourselves to the lowest two minibands ( denoted by @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) and coupling between neighbouring wells the hamiltonian in the presence of an electric field @xmath15",

    "diagonalizing the hamiltonian @xmath22 leads to renormalized coefficients in @xmath22 and @xmath23@xcite which we use in the following .",
    "we calculate the wannier functions in a kronig - penney - type model . following ref .",
    "@xcite we model the nonparabolicity by an energy dependent effective mass @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the effective mass at the conduction band minimum of energy @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the energy gap . then the usual connection rules hold for the envelope function provided that the momentum matrix element @xmath28 between the conduction and valence band states is identical in both materials .",
    "we use the values@xcite @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 ev , @xmath32 ev , and the conduction band discontinuity @xmath33 ev .",
    "these parameters yield a relation @xmath34 which is in excellent agreement with the band structure of alas@xcite for the energies of interest .",

    "fast intersubband relaxation the current from subband @xmath7 in well @xmath8 to subband @xmath41 in well @xmath42 is given by the following expression@xcite : @xmath43 \\label{eqj}\\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath44 is the spectral function of subband @xmath7 in well number @xmath8 and @xmath45 is the fermi function . the energy @xmath46 is measured with respect to the electrochemical potential @xmath47 in well @xmath8 yielding an implicit dependence of @xmath44 on @xmath47 .",

    "we obtain @xmath44 in equilibrium from the retarded self - energy @xmath52 neglecting the coupling to the other wells . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have calculated the self - energy for scattering from the screened potential of ionized impurities within the self - consistent single - site - approximation . as an additional contribution to the self - energy we study here the impact of interface roughness",
    "we consider an interface located at @xmath53 exhibiting thickness fluctuations @xmath54 of the order of @xmath55 ( we use @xmath56  which is one monolayer of gaas ) .",
    "we assume @xmath57 and the correlation @xmath58 this can be motivated in the following way : at a given point @xmath59 there is an island of thickness @xmath60 with a probability @xmath61 ( we use an average coverage @xmath62 ) .",

    "the elements @xmath71 result in scattering within the wells .",
    "we calculate their contribution to the self - energy within the self - consistent born - approximation @xmath72 where the factor 2 takes into account the two interfaces per well .",
    "the calculation for the subband @xmath14 is performed in the same way . with ( [ eqexpkorr ] )",
    "we obtain the matrix element @xmath73 in contrast to this the usual choice ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath74 yields @xmath75 . in order to compare both expressions",
    "we consider the matrix element for scattering at a single circular island of thickness @xmath76 and radius @xmath77 which is given by @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the bessel function of the first kind .",
    "now there are @xmath80 islands and we assume that negative and positive @xmath76 cancel each other .",
    "then @xmath81 for large @xmath82 as in eq .  ( [ equqexp ] ) with a prefactor differing by @xmath83 .",
    "this indicates that the choice ( [ eqexpkorr ] ) captures an essential part of physics not contained in the usual choice .",
    "furthermore , the single island result reflects the quality of the born - approximation for the self - energy .",
    "the analysis of a @xmath65-potential reveals that diagrams containing multiple scattering at a single island become important if the product @xmath84 is larger than 1 . using the value @xmath85 this yields @xmath86 .",
    "( for our parameters @xmath87 nm . )",
    "this expression can be interpreted easily : the right hand side is the energy the electron gains if it is located at an island exhibiting a larger well width .",
    "the left hand side is the quantization energy associated with a length @xmath88 .",
    "the localization of the wavefunction takes place if the energy gain due to the larger well width dominates the cost due to the localization . in this case higher order diagrams become important .",
    "summing the contributions between different subbands given by eq .",
    "( [ eqj ] ) we obtain the current @xmath89 depending on the field and the electron densities .",
    "1a shows @xmath90 exhibiting a first maximum @xmath91 ma at @xmath92 mev where the current is dominated by @xmath93 transitions and a second peak @xmath94 ma at @xmath95 mev due to the @xmath96 resonance .",
    "the interface roughness has two implications : firstly the maxima are broadened and slightly shifted due to the contribution to the self - energies via eq .",
    "( [ eqsigmarough ] ) .",
    "secondly there is a nonresonant current due to the @xmath97 transitions dominating the behaviour between the maxima .    in order to study the domain formation we consider effective fields @xmath98 between wells @xmath99 and @xmath100 fulfilling the discretized poisson equation @xmath101 . then the local currents @xmath102 have to be equal for all @xmath99 in the steady state .",
    "the total voltage across the superlattice is @xmath103 .",
    "using the boundary conditions @xmath104 , @xmath105 we obtain the current - voltage characteristic shown in fig .",
    "1b which exhibits the usual sequence of branches @xcite .",
    "in contrast to previous theoretical results the maximal current of the branches ( 90 @xmath41a ) is significantly lower than the height of the first resonance .",
    "it is almost independent of the boundary conditions , which mainly affect the voltage where the leftmost homogeneous branch breaks up .",
    "the maximal current of 90 @xmath41a is between the two experimental results@xcite 60 @xmath41a and 130 @xmath41a for samples # 1 and # 2 , respectively , which both have the nominal sample parameters used here .",
    "we can reproduce the difference in current between both samples by assuming barrier widths which differ by just one monolayer , thus suggesting a possible explanation for the experimental discrepancy .",
    "the minimal currents of the branches ( 26 @xmath41a ) seem to be lower than the experimental values .",
    "they depend strongly on the nonresonant currents , e.g. , we obtain the value 10 @xmath41a ignoring transitions via @xmath106 .",
    "this indicates that we have probably underestimated the nonresonant current .",
    "the slope of the branches is steeper in our calculation than found experimentally ; this could be due to some additional contact resistance of the order of 1 k@xmath107 which is not included in our calculation .    in conclusion , we have presented a microscopic model for sequential tunnelling in weakly coupled quantum wells .",
    "the model describes the domain formation in superlattices quantitatively with no fitting parameters .",
    "nonresonant transitions due to interface roughness have been shown to strongly affect the current between the resonances and the extent of the current branches .",
