    "the shape of bone is the adaptive result of bone in the mechanical and physiological environment  @xcite . a map ,",
    "the visual representation of our real world symbol model , can reveal not only the spatial structure properties of an object but also the changes in time series  @xcite .",
    "the mapping of bone surface , therefore , is used as an approach to study the adaptability of bone morphology .",
    "mapping technique has become an even more powerful and useful method to do scientific research .",
    "mapping and flattening techniques have also been widely used in medical research  @xcite .",
    "they are both concerned with the development methods .",
    "the flattening technique develops the three - dimensional object to a two - dimensional one  @xcite while the mapping technique plays an essential role in interpreting the surface structure of an object  @xcite .",
    "the advancements and improvements of three - dimensional imaging of bone in vivo  @xcite have brought better data collection methods of bone surface , but the mapping techniques have not been systematically explored with satisfactory results .    to map the bone surface , some geographic marks and geographic coordinates such as the bone surface prime meridian , the equator line or the contour should be identified  @xcite .",
    "they should be defined on the bone s coordinate system . in order to study the bone s changes caused by the external factors ,",
    "it is fundamental to set up a bone coordinate system when mapping the bone surface . in our study , we have set up a coordinate system with uniqueness on the principal axes of inertia of the bone in vivo .",
    "the coordinate system is thus employed to determine the prime meridian , and the average radius of the tomographic boundary is employed to determine the contour to map the bone surface .",
    "this means that the bone surface mapping technique could present an alternate approach to study the bone s morphology .",
    "the ct image of bone in vivo can generate the principal moments of inertia and the direction cosines  @xcite .",
    "suppose the moment of inertia of the bone s tissue relative to its center of mass is a constant ; then the magnitude of the bone s principal moments of inertia will be determined by its shape and mass distribution .",
    "the inertia tensor suggests that we can always find a group of coordinate systems where three products of inertia will be nil at the same time  @xcite .",
    "the magnitudes of these three principal moments of inertia could come out with three results : ( i ) all three are equal ; ( ii ) two out of three are equal and ( iii ) each one is different from the other . when the object is homogeneous , in the first case , it is a sphere ; in the second , an ellipsoid , a cube , a cylinder or a rectangular .",
    "when the bone s location and orientation relative to inertia reference frame ( i.e. the coordinate system is defined by the ct coordinate system ) are fixed , in the first case , there are numerous principal axes of inertia , while in the second case , the orientation of one principal axis can be determined , but not the other two .",
    "therefore , in the first and second case , the principal moments of inertia have nothing to do with their principal axes of inertia . in the third case",
    ", however , the direction cosines of the bone s principal axis of inertia relative to inertia reference frame are unique , which means a one - to - one corresponding relation between the direction cosines of the bone s principal axes of inertia and its shape .",
    "if the bone is defined as a collection of elements of volume @xmath0 , the element s position can be represented by @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 is located in the center of mass ) , then the magnitude of the principal moments of inertia can be represented respectively by : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the density , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the pixel sizes and @xmath8 the layer distances of ct images .",

    "[ eq2 ] and  [ eq3 ] , the limited rotations can always turn three products of inertia into zero at the same time .",
    "the bone s shape is asymmetrical and its structure is anisotropic  @xcite .",
    "[ eq3 ] exposes the direction cosines of principal axes of inertia relative to the inertia reference frame of the bone characterization are unique . as a result ,",
    "the coordinate system set upon the principal moment of inertia can not only depict the position and orientation of the bone , but also verify the bone surface shape and its changes when making a quantitative analysis .",
    "[ eq2 ] and  [ eq3 ] also suggest that we can set up a coordinate system whose coordinate origin is located arbitrarily at the center of mass of the bone . after limited rotations , the coordinate axes is positioned on the principal axes of inertia .",
    "ct scanning simplifies the bone as a collection of elements of volume @xmath0 ( different densities ) . when performing an isotropic scanning ( where pixel size must be the same as the layer distance ) , the volume of @xmath0 is a constant .",
    "the position of @xmath0 relative to the center of mass differs from one another . when the result of eq .",
    "[ eq3 ] is replaced for that in eq .",
    "[ eq2 ] accordingly and when the bone s coordinate system is positioned on the principal axes of inertia , the rotation will change the original ct image .",
    "it is necessary , then , to reconstruct the new image , which can be performed by the following equation : @xmath19 where @xmath1 stands for the position of @xmath0 after rotation , @xmath20 for that of the reconstructed tomogram and @xmath21 for a function that truncates a number to an integer by removing the fractional part of the number . to keep the ct images isotropic ,",
    "@xmath22 is defined in eq .",
    "[ eq4 ] , and its pixal size and layer distance are kept the same of those of the original image . according to eq .",
    "[ eq4 ] , when keeping the @xmath0 to be in a cube , the new ct image after rotation remains to be closed and continuous .",
    "ct scanning divides the bone surface into a collection of the tomographic image boundaries . in this way",
    ", the mapping of the bone surface has become an issue to develop the tomographic boundary , making it necessary to detect and draw the tomographic boundary . before a new ct scanning ,",
    "the equipment is reset , i.e. the gray value of the air is set as zero .",
    "the scanned tomographic images of bone are processed by eq .",
    "[ eq4 ] , and their boundaries are drawn by the following equation : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the number of sequence of tomogram , @xmath25 the position of @xmath0 relative to the tomographic center of mass and @xmath26 the density of @xmath25 .    when mapping the bone surface , the bone will be `` cut '' - from a cylindrical surface to a rectangle , or a rhombus .",
    "however it is cut , its ultimate area would be the same .",
    "but when it is a rectangle , there is only one . how to cut the bone into a rectangle ?",
    "the two principal axes of inertia ( the minimal and maximal principal moment of inertia ) form a plane . on this plane ,",
    "the bone surface boundary is called the prime meridian , which is used as the surface cutting line to develop the bone surface .",
    "the following equation will make it happen : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the position of the @xmath0 at the tomographic boundary relative to the tomographic center of mass , @xmath29 the position of tomographic center of mass relative to the inertia reference frame and @xmath30 the sequence of @xmath0 of the boundary after being cut .",
    "[ eq6 ] sequences the @xmath0s at the tomographic boundary which has been cut .",
    "the average radium of the tomographic boundary perpendicular to the minimal ( maximal ) principal moment of inertia is defined as the `` sea level '' , which is used as a datum line so that the tomographic boundary can be developed by the following equation : @xmath31 where @xmath24 shares the same definition of that in eq .",

    "[ eq4]-  [ eq7 ] have developed the closed surface into an open three - dimensional curved one with the properties of a contour .",
    "the three - dimensional curved map of the bone surface can be further developed into a two - dimensional plane .",
    "we can , however , translate the bone surface into a plane with the help of the following equation : @xmath35 where @xmath36 presents the position of @xmath0 in a plane whose surface has been flattened , and @xmath37 @xmath24 stands for the value of contour on @xmath38 in bone surface mapping .",
    "[ eq8 ] suggests that the mapping of the bone surface actually serves as a simulation of the bone surface structure .",

    ", we were able to scan and collect the data of a 25-year - old wrestler s sesamoid bones beneath the head of the first metatarsal bone of both feet .",

    "when the coordinate system of the sesamoid bone rotate around axes @xmath61 at @xmath62 degree respectively , the axes of of the sesamoid bone coincide with those of the principal moments of inertia .",
    "it s shown that the morphologically asymmetric and heterogeneously distributed bone has the uniqueness of direction cosines of their principal moments of inertia .",
    "an arbitrary coordinate system set upon the bone s center of mass can make every coordinate axis coincide with the principal moment of inertia by coordinate transformation , i.e. the proposed principal axis s coordinate system has its uniqueness .",
    "this method can be applied to both the homogeneous asymmetric geometry and the heterogeneous asymmetric geometry .",

    "it can be concluded that the professional training has caused adaptative changes of the sesamoid bone s shape .",
    "the structural changes can be depicted by the density and distribution while the shape and its changes can be analyzed by the bone surface mapping .",
    "the generalized papoulis theorem  @xcite elucidates that the bone surface shape keeps its geometric invariance , such as rotation , translation or dimension change  @xcite .",
    "this ensures the consistency of the ct scanning results of different postures of bone in vivo when its isotropy is ascertained .",
    "the uniqueness of the relative consistency of the inertia reference system of principal moments of inertia on direction cosines provide evidence to the bone surface mapping technique .",
    "the characters such as the geometric invariance and the uniqueness of the coordinate system of the principal moments of inertia have enabled the bone surface mapping technique to depict the bone s external morphological characters .",
