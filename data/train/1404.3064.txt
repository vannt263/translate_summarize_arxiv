    "one of the most fascinating features of a @xmath0 heisenberg antiferromagnetic ( afm ) chain is the occurrence of an excitation gap first suggested by haldane [ ] . in the presence of easy plane anisotropy @xmath2 and a magnetic field @xmath3 along the hard axis , the @xmath0 chain is described by the hamiltonian : @xmath4\\ , , \\label{s1model}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 .",
    "the physical properties of the system strongly depend on the strength of anisotropy @xmath2 . for @xmath6 ,",
    "the ground state is a singlet and the lowest excitation is a degenerate massive triplet with @xmath0 . for positive",
    "@xmath2 the triplet splits into an @xmath7 state and a degenerate @xmath8 doublet with lower energy .",
    "when @xmath2 is increased , the haldane gap is diminished until it vanishes [ ] at some critical @xmath9 . at this point",
    "a transition occurs , so when @xmath2 is further increased we observe the rise of a gap of different nature [ ] .",
    "we focus on the large@xmath2 limit , where the anisotropy @xmath2 is much larger than the exchange coupling @xmath10 . for zero magnetic field",
    "this phase is characterized by a nondegenerate ground state that is the direct product of states with @xmath7 , because , due to the large anisotropy , all spins are forced to lie in the _ xy _ plane .",
    "the lowest excited states can be constructed by reducing or increasing the azimuthal spin by one unit at a site , so that the total spin in the @xmath11 direction is @xmath12 , with a gap @xmath13 .",
    "the energy momentum dispersion of these degenerate states has been calculated through a systematic 1/@xmath2 expansion carried to third order [ ] .",
    "several more terms beyond the third order have become available [ ] .",
    "the application of magnetic field along the @xmath11 direction induces a zero  temperature quantum phase transition at a critical field @xmath14 , above which magnetization develops in the ground state and the spectrum of magnetic excitations becomes gapless . at this point level",
    "crossing occurs and the azimuthal spin of the ground state is no longer zero but increases with increasing field .",
    "the value of @xmath14 is defined by the gap @xmath15 , @xmath16 , for which a third  order approximation is given by [ ] @xmath17    a second transition occurs at a critical field @xmath18 , above which the ground state is fully polarized and the gapped excitation spectrum of a magnon can be calculated exactly .",
    "the value of @xmath18 is defined by the lowest gap of the magnon dispersion : @xmath19    a physical realization of an @xmath0 chain in the large@xmath2 limit is the organic compound @xmath20 , abbreviated as dtn , a system of weakly interacting chains . the field ",
    "induced quantum phase transitions ( qpt ) described above , as well as the thermodynamic and transport properties of dtn , have attracted considerable experimental and theoretical attention [ , ] .",
    "actually , dtn is considered to be the quasi ",
    "one  dimensional limit of a three  dimensional ( 3d ) system , where the exchange couplings perpendicular to the chain @xmath21 are finite but much smaller than @xmath10 , @xmath22 .",
    "the intermediate phase in dtn has been experimentally identified as a 3d _ xy _ afm ordered phase that can be regarded as a bose-einstein condensate ( bec ) of magnons below some critical temperature @xmath23 [ ] .",
    "the 3d ordering is a result of the presence of @xmath21 , which becomes significant whenever the energy gap is smaller than @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath0 system can be mapped into a gas of semi hard core bosons , where the @xmath24 , and @xmath25 states are mapped into a state with zero , one , and two bosons per site .",
    "nevertheless , it is well known that for the one  dimensional ( 1d ) afm , quantum fluctuations are strongest and only quasi  long  range phase coherence occurs , which is turned into true long range by the presence of weak 3d couplings .    in this paper",
    "we will concentrate on the 1d model where quantum effects become much more important .",
    "we can gain a better insight into the problem if we consider the following mapping : when @xmath26 , the state with total @xmath27 approaches the ground state due to the zeeman energy .",
    "the idea is to project the original hamiltonian into this low  energy subspace using a new @xmath1 representation .",
    "a mapping based on similar considerations is possible for @xmath28 , using the single magnon state and the ferromagnetic ( fm ) ground state .",
    "a similar analysis has been carried out for @xmath1 ladders in a magnetic field [ ] , but for reasons of completeness we give more details about the mapping in appendix  [ sec : ap1 ] .",
    "the original @xmath0 hamiltonian reduces to that of the @xmath1 _ xxz _ heisenberg afm chain in the presence of the magnetic field : @xmath29\\ , , \\label{s12model}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "ferromagnetic order in the ground state is established when the magnetic field exceeds the critical value @xmath32 .",
    "the whole phase can be described by the effective hamiltonian , where    1 .",
    "the gapped phase of model for @xmath33 corresponds to the negatively fm ordered state of model for @xmath34 , 2 .   the gapless phase of for @xmath35 corresponds to gapless phase of model for @xmath36 , 3 .",
    "and the fm state of model for @xmath37 corresponds to the positively fm ordered state of model for @xmath38 .",
    "the obvious advantage of this mapping is that the @xmath1 _ xxz _ chain is exactly solvable .",
    "the bethe ansatz technique gives explicit analytic expressions for its eigenfunction and eigenvalues , and the thermodynamics can be calculated through a set of nonlinear integral equations . also , the complete integrability of the @xmath1 _ xxz _ quantum spin chain has some interesting implications on the thermal transport properties of the original @xmath0 chain .    here",
    "we explore the effectiveness of this mapping .",
    "a first direct test can be given if we compare the critical fields obtained by the two models .",
    "for the first critical field , model predicts @xmath39 , which coincides with eq .   only at first order in terms of @xmath40 , whereas both models predict the same value for the second critical field given by eq .  .",
    "this is an indication that the mapping should be more accurate close to @xmath18 rather than @xmath14 . throughout this paper",
    "we adopt a certain choice of parameter @xmath41 in our numerical calculations in order to be consistent with earlier work on electron spin resonance ( esr ) theoretical analysis [ ] of model and to obtain semiquantitative agreement with experimental data on dtn [ , ] . under this choice ,",
    "the critical fields are @xmath42 and @xmath43 for model , and 2 and 8 for model , respectively .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : thermodynamics ] we present a detailed calculation of the magnetization and the specific heat for both the @xmath0 model and the effective @xmath1 model , using a variety of numerical techniques . in sec .",
    "[ sec : transport ] we address the calculation of dynamic correlation functions pertinent to the study of thermal transport in both models . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : esr ] we take advantage of the effective @xmath1 model in order to elucidate the field dependence of esr in the intermediate phase @xmath35 and thus complete recent theoretical analyses [ ] carried out within the @xmath0 model .",
    "our main conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] , while some theoretical issues are relegated to two brief appendices .",
    "this section is devoted to the calculation of the thermodynamic quantities , such as magnetization and the specific heat .",
    "it is important that this calculation be done for the original hamiltonian directly in some numerical ways in order to test the validity of the approximations used while performing the mapping .    for this reason",
    "an algorithm based on the application of the renormalization group to transfer matrices ( tmrg ) is employed , where the @xmath0 quantum chain is mapped onto a two  dimensional classical system by a trotter ",
    "suzuki decomposition of the partition function [ ] .",
    "the main advantage of this method is that the thermodynamic limit can be performed exactly and results can be obtained with satisfactory accuracy .",
    "moreover , a second numerical calculation is carried out on the basis of the finite  temperature lanczos method ( ftlm ) [ ] .",
    "although the tmrg results of thermodynamic quantities are considered to be more accurate , the ftlm applies also to the calculation of dynamic correlations such as those presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : transport ] for the discussion of thermal transport .    according to thermodynamic bethe ansatz ( tba ) , a system of nonlinear integral equations provides all the required information for the calculation of the free energy of model in the thermodynamic limit [ ] .",
    "the particular value of the anisotropy parameter @xmath30 is especially convenient because the calculation of thermodynamic quantities requires a solution of only two nonlinear integral equations .",
    "more details are discussed in appendix  [ sec : ap2 ] .      in this subsection , we calculate the magnetization curve as a function of temperature and applied magnetic field . in a gapped spin system in the presence of external magnetic field , the zeeman term is responsible for the closure of the gap and spontaneous magnetization is developed in the ground state .",
    "the behavior of the magnetization curve near a critical field @xmath44 is nontrivial and depends on the model and its dimensionality . in most cases where second  order transitions occur",
    ", the magnetization @xmath45 near @xmath44 behaves like @xmath46    models with the same critical exponent @xmath47 are said to belong to the same universality class independently of the microscopic details of the system . in general , the universality class of the model is hard to derive prior to a direct calculation of magnetization . for the @xmath0 haldane chain ,",
    "the critical exponent was found equal to @xmath48 , a result based on an equivalent continuum limit of quantum chains and a mapping of the effective low  energy lagrangian to a bose fluid with @xmath47 repulsion [ ] .",
    "nevertheless , a similar low ",
    "energy quantum field theory is not available for the large@xmath2 @xmath0 chain and hence an independent calculation of the magnetization curve is needed . among the models that have the same critical exponent @xmath48",
    "are the @xmath1 ladders [ ] and the @xmath1 bond  alternating chain [ ] .",
    "the zero temperature magnetization of the @xmath1 _ xxz _ model is based on a bethe ansatz solution of the hamiltonian .",
    "more specifically , c.  n.  yang and c.  p.  yang [ ] studied the ground state energy as a function of @xmath49 and magnetization , and among the various results , they proved that @xmath50 close to @xmath51 behaves as follows @xmath52 note that the dependence of @xmath50 on the anisotropy constant @xmath49 enters only through the critical field @xmath53 and thus does not affect the value of the critical exponent @xmath48 .",

    "the critical exponent is extracted and is found to be @xmath58 close to @xmath14 , as well as close to @xmath18 .",
    "this foreseen result renders model in the same universality class as the haldane or @xmath1 _ xxz _ chain .",
    "( ii ) as mentioned already , we expect that the mapping close to @xmath18 is more accurate than close to @xmath14 .",

    "a further increase of the magnetic field will reopen the gap , and for @xmath37 the @xmath64 curve decreases with increasing temperature and vanishes exponentially . in fig .",
    "[ mag](a ) we present the above  described behavior of @xmath45 and the position of the extrema @xmath59 is indicated by dots .",
    "the presence of minima and maxima at low temperatures is not a surprising result , since similar features were found for systems of @xmath1 ladders [ , , , ] and haldane chains [ ] , where this nontrivial behavior was interpreted as a luttinger liquid ( ll ) crossover , with @xmath59 corresponding to the temperature below which the description of the system in terms of a ll is valid .",

    "<S> we present a study of the one  dimensional @xmath0 antiferromagnetic spin chain with large easy plane anisotropy , with special emphasis on field  induced quantum phase transitions . </S>",
    "<S> temperature and magnetic field dependence of magnetization , specific heat , and thermal conductivity is presented using a combination of numerical methods . in addition , the original @xmath0 model is mapped into the low  energy effective @xmath1 _ xxz _ heisenberg chain , a model which is exactly solvable using the bethe ansatz technique </S>",
    "<S> . the effectiveness of the mapping is explored , and we show that all considered quantities are in qualitative , and in some cases quantitative , agreement . the thermal conductivity of the considered @xmath0 model is found to be strongly influenced by the underlying effective description . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we elucidate the low  lying electron spin resonance spectrum , based on a semi  analytical bethe ansatz calculation of the effective @xmath1 model .     + cctp-2014 - 07 </S>"
