    "traditionally , in quantum mechanics , when one solves the schrodinger equations , dirac equations , or klein - gordon equations , to obtain the bound states of an atom , at some points , the sign of a parameter s square root has to be chosen , and the choice leads either to  usual \" solution or  anomalous \" solution@xcite . the traditionally discarded ",
    "anomalous \" solutions can be explained as quantum states occupied by electrons under the  usual \" bohr ground level .",
    "the bounding energy is comparable to the rest mass of the electron , and therefore is called to be deep dirac level ( ddl ) , electron deep level , or relativistically bounded level in literatures@xcite .",
    "the existence of the ddls are debated theoretically , as well as experimentally .",
    "some experimental phenomenons have been explained as existence of the ddls@xcite , but being questioned by others@xcite .    with the development of high intensity lasers , nowadays , the electrons , and even the nuclei ,",
    "can be accelerated by the lasers to relativistic energies in a very short distance like 1 @xmath1 m , and therefore may populate atoms to the ddl states .",
    "due to the very short distance from the electron s ddl orbit to the nuclei , the electron capture ( ec ) life time can be changed greatly .",
    "therefore one can use the ec rate as an indicator of the ddl state . in this paper , we discuss the possibilities of using this novel setup to test the existence of the hypothetical ddls .",
    "for simplicity , here we only briefly give the ddl solution deduced from the klein - gordon equation .",
    "the ddl solutions of other equations like the relativistic schrodinger equation and dirac equation can be found in ref .",

    ", the energy , orbit , and wave function can be simplified as , @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 as one can see , taking @xmath24 as an example , in the case of the ddl , the electron is deeply bounded to @xmath25  mev , compared with the well - known bohr case @xmath26  ev .",
    "the ddl s orbit is only about 390 fm away from the nucleus , compared with the bohr orbit , @xmath27 .    because the wave function @xmath28 , this  un - physical \" solution was traditionally rejected in quantum mechanic textbooks@xcite .",
    "the infinity comes from the assumption that the nucleus is point - like , and therefore the coulomb potential is infinite at r = 0 . even through , the wave function @xmath29 is still square integrable , i.e. @xmath30 is not infinity .",
    "in fact , the wave function eq . [ eq.psi.t ]",
    "has already been normalized to @xmath31 in @xmath32 .",
    "directly populating ddls via photoemission must be highly forbidden , because otherwise a lot of high energy ambient photons can be observed due to the fact that the ddl is about 0.5 mev below the normal bohr ground state .",
    "the ddls may be populated via electron - positron pair effect .",
    "when a relativistic electron approach a nucleus , @xmath33 pairs can produced through the following two processes : @xmath34 @xmath35 the larger the electrical field , i.e. the closer to the nuclear , the higher the possibility is . therefore , the electrons in the @xmath36 pairs produced near the nuclei have higher chance to be bounded to be ddls . because the electron in the ddl is very closer to the nucleus , it has higher possibility to be caught which results in a short ec life time , if the ec decay model is allowed .",
    "the changing of the nuclear ec life time may be used as an indicator of the ddls .    with the development of high intensive laser technologies , the intensities of today",
    "s laser could be as high as @xmath37 w/@xmath38@xcite . with high intensive lasers ,",
    "the electron - positron pairs have been experimentally observed@xcite .",
    "when an @xmath36 pair is created near an nuclei , the positron escapes due to the coulomb field , and the electrons may be caught to the ddls .",
    "the ddl may also be produced through the mechanism called nuclear excitation by electron transition ( neet)@xcite . when an electron moves from an outside orbit to an inner one , the energy difference @xmath39 between the two orbits is usually carried away by the @xmath40-ray or the auger electron .",
    "however , it is possible that part of that energy can be transferred to the nucleus and get it excited .",
    "that is why it got its name , the nuclear excitation by electron transition .",

    ". there are one neutron , one neutrino , and the other nucleons in the finial state , @xmath60 , i.e. @xmath61 . since the operator @xmath57 acts only on weak - interaction participants , the ec decay rate @xmath62 is roughly proportional to the probability of finding the electron in the nuclear volume@xcite , i.e. @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the electron s wave function , and @xmath65 is radius of the nucleus . here",
    "we use the assumption that the nucleon s wave function is constant in the nuclear volume .",
    "furthermore , the coulomb interaction difference between the normal bohr state and the ddl is very small compared with the strong interaction inside the nuclei .",
