    "this is due , with some exceptions @xcite , to the decoupling between positional and orientational order of the constituting organic molecules : depending on the chemical structure and external physical conditions ( temperature , pressure ) , molecular position and orientation are characterized by a different symmetry @xcite . in this paper , we focus on the case in which the position of the molecules is random on the long range , whereas their direction shows a finite degree of orientational order , i.e. , on the nematic phase .",
    "+ composition and arrangement of lcs reflect on their physical and optical properties : lcs usually behave as anisotropic crystals , but with a pointwise direction of the principal axes @xcite . at the same time",
    ", the high mobility of the lc molecules favors a high degree of tunability through the application of external electric and/or magnetic fields , regardless of their oscillation frequency .",
    "thermotropic lcs are also highly sensitive ( including phase transitions ) to temperature changes @xcite .",
    "all these characteristics have been exploited in several areas , the most important being the display technology @xcite . in optics and photonics ,",
    "lcs are currently used in many other applications , involving optical signal processing with tunable devices @xcite , temperature sensing @xcite , tunable lasing action @xcite , spatial light modulation @xcite , wavefront manipulation via the berry phase @xcite , among others .",
    "+ the strong tunability of lcs is present even at optical frequencies .",
    "thus , lcs feature a very strong optical nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "depending on the excitation , different kinds of nonlinear mechanisms come into play , such as reorientational , thermal , photorefractive , electrostrictive , electronic responses , as well as due to modulation of the order parameter @xcite .",
    "hence , on the one hand lcs are an ideal workbench to investigate the interplay between different nonlinearities @xcite , on the other hand nonlinear optics helps studying the properties of new lc mixtures , including those doped with dyes @xcite . + in the context of nonlinear optics , materials often exhibit an overall response resulting from the combination of various processes @xcite . the interplay / competition of nonlinear mechanisms leads to a rich scenario of all - optical phenomena @xcite , in many cases adding extra degrees of tunability and disclosing new ways to optical manipulation and signal processing .",
    "early examples to this extent concerned the study of an intensity - dependent refractive index in kerr materials with additional higher order contributions @xcite . to date , a number of side and higher - order effects have been combined with a self - focusing cubic response as means to stabilize two - dimensional ( 2 + 1)d soliton solutions , in time or in space @xcite , while other examples of the occurrence of two distinct nonlinear responses include spatio - temporal confinement of light into bullets , predicted in nonlocal / noninstantaneous media @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper we address the interplay and competition of the two dominant lc nonlinearities when the input is a continuous wave ( cw ) , that is , reorientational and thermo - optic responses to light .",
    "we consider a standard planar cell much longer than the diffraction length of the input beam in order to study the mutual role of linear diffraction and nonlinear effects .",
    "in fact , both nonlinearities manifest as point - wise changes in the refractive index . at the same time , both of them exhibit a highly nonlocal character , i.e. , a light - induced perturbation much wider than the exciting beam @xcite .",
    "since reorientation usually dominates over thermo - optical effects in pure lcs , we consider a specific guest dopant added to the host lc mixture in order to enhance light absorption in a specific range of wavelengths @xcite .",
    "thereby , employing one wavelength inside and one outside the absorption band of the dye , we can evaluate the interaction of the two responses when simultaneously excited . using the highly nonlocal approximation @xcite",
    ", we model the behavior of the two nonlinearities when acting alone or together , considering both the propagation of a single beam or the interaction of two beams at different wavelengths .",

    "in the nematic phase ( nematic lcs , nlcs ) , the molecules lack positional order on the long range , but have a high degree of orientational order on macroscopic distances @xcite .",

    "the thermo - optic effect in nlcs stems from the marked dependence of @xmath1 on temperature @xcite , in turn due to the temperature dependence of the refractive indices @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the temperature of the nematic - isotropic transition for a given nlc mixture , whereas @xmath13 and @xmath14 are fitting parameters derived from experimental measurements @xcite . from eqs .",
