    "driven by recent technological interests in magnetic recording and data storage , it has become possible to grow well - characterized thin films , multilayers , and nanostructures .",
    "simultaneously , advances in synchrotron radiation instrumentation have made it possible to determine the electronic and magnetic properties of these systems in an element - specific way .",
    "x - ray magnetic circular dichroism ( xmcd ) in conjunction with the sum rules enables the separation of the spin and orbital contributions to the total magnetic moments @xcite while complementary soft x - ray resonant magnetic scattering measurements can provide details about the layer dependence of the magnetic moments , periodicity of the magnetic domain structures , and roughness of the magnetic layers @xcite . developments of theoretical models which treat these magnetic systems have also been quite successful .",
    "it has been known already for some time that the spin and orbital magnetic moments at surfaces are often enhanced compared to their bulk values due to symmetry breaking and @xmath2 band narrowing at the surface @xcite .",
    "electron hybridization at interfaces can give rise to charge transfer across the interface @xcite resulting in a change of the density of states ( dos ) near the fermi level .",
    "this can enhance the spin and orbital magnetic moments in magnetic layers and can induce magnetization in adjacent `` non - magnetic '' layers . in giant magnetoresistance ( gmr ) materials , such as co / cu multilayers , the magnetic layers are ( anti)ferromagnetically coupled by the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) interaction , which is accompanied by an induced oscillatory magnetic moment in the `` non - magnetic '' spacer layer .",
    "the magnetic properties of two metals near their common interface are essentially determined by the differences in electronegativity .",
    "similarly to the model of friedel @xcite the excess nuclear charge displaces locally the mobile electrons , i.e.  the electrons close to the fermi level , until the displaced charges totally screen out the nuclear charge .",
    "this effect occurs at the interface over distances of the order of a few interatomic distances , i.e.  the screening is strongly localized . in fe with only few spin - up electrons close to @xmath3 ,",
    "the screening is almost uniquely due to spin - down @xmath2 electrons .",
    "most of the attention so far has been focused on the magnetism in @xmath4 materials , although the possibility to observe magnetism in @xmath1 and @xmath0 elements in a surface geometry has been noticed early on @xcite .",
    "impurity systems have been thoroughly studied by relativistic calculations and in particular the systematics of @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 impurities in a magnetic host have been established @xcite .",
    "experimentally , sizeable spin and orbital magnetic moments in @xmath0 transition metals due to the hybridization with a magnetic @xmath5 element were found in e.g.   fepd @xcite and copt @xcite alloys , ni / pt multilayers @xcite , and ir impurities @xcite . also fe mono- and bi - layers on w(110 ) received a considerable theoretical interest @xcite .",
    "recently , the spin and orbital moments for w / fe , ir / fe multilayers were reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . using atomistic arguments the authors concluded solely from the measurements of these two @xmath7 elements that the systematic behavior across the series was different than for @xmath7 impurities .",
    "our systematic study across the entire @xmath7 series shows that in the vicinity of w and ir a sign change of the orbital moment occurs .",
    "therefore , it should come as no surprise that the orbital moment of w can be positive or negative at the interface or for the impurity , respectively .    by contrasting the results of @xmath7 impurities with @xmath7 interfaces in fe",
    ", we will be able to establish the role of band filling versus the importance of geometry or structure of both the impurity and interface .",
    "this is an important issue since the work in ref .",
    "@xcite implied that the induced magnetic behavior of @xmath7 layers may be radically different than that of impurities and alloys .",
    "if this were to be true then we would expect the magnetic properties to be determined more or less by structural considerations only and not to see any commonality between impurity and interface as a function of atomic number z. in the case of an w impurity in fe , the magnetic properties of the former are determined by @xmath0-@xmath4 hybridization , whilst at a w interface in fe this @xmath0-@xmath4 hybridization is reduced by the in - plane @xmath0-@xmath0 hybridization .",
    "a question arises as to whether this @xmath7-@xmath5 hybridization is sufficiently reduced to alter , drastically enough , the magnetic properties of w interfaces in fe in comparison to w impurities in fe to give rise to the proposed radical new behavior as suggested in ref .  @xcite .    in the present study ,",
    "the systematics of @xmath7 and @xmath6 interfaces with a fe substrate will be considered .",
    "the relative alignment of the spin and orbital moments will be compared with the predictions based on hund s third rule .",
    "this rule states that spin and orbital moment should be parallel ( antiparallel ) for more ( less ) than half - filled shell , c.f .",
    "[ hund ] where the atomic values of these quantities are shown .",
    "although strictly valid only for single atoms , this rule seems to be applicable also to solids with only a few exceptions , such as u metal @xcite and vanadium in vau@xmath8 @xcite and vpt@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the violation reported in fe / w multilayers",
    "@xcite seems surprising , since w as an impurity and in alloys does not show this violation @xcite .",
    "the opposite situation arises for ir that obeys the third hund s rule in fe / ir multilayers @xcite but violates it as a 5d impurity in fe @xcite .",
    "therefore , in this study we will compare the electronic and magnetic properties of a @xmath7 transition metal with those of an impurity .",
    "calculations were performed within the framework of relativistic local spin density ( lsd ) band theory , where analogous to the non - relativistic case , a set of coupled kohn - sham - dirac equations is derived which describes the ground state of a relativistic many - electron system @xcite with the corresponding hamiltonian of the form    @xmath10 + { \\boldsymbol{\\beta}}\\sigma_z b^{\\text{eff } } [ n{({\\bf r)}},m{({\\bf r ) } } ] \\;\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath11 & = & v^{\\text{ext } } { ( { \\bf r)}}+ \\frac{\\delta e^{\\text{xc } } [ n{({\\bf r)}},m{({\\bf r ) } } ] } { \\delta n{({\\bf r ) } } } \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\ ; e^2 \\int \\frac{n{({\\bf r^{\\prime})}}}{| { { \\bf r}}- { { \\bf r}^{\\prime}}| } d{{\\bf r}^{\\prime}}\\;\\ ; , \\\\ b^{\\text{eff } } [ n{({\\bf r)}},m{({\\bf r ) } } ] & = & \\frac{eh}{2mc } \\frac{\\delta e^{\\text{xc } } [ n{({\\bf r)}},m{({\\bf r ) } } ] } { \\delta m{({\\bf r ) } } } \\;\\ ; , \\\\ n{({\\bf r)}}&= & \\sum \\psi^+_i { ( { \\bf r)}}\\psi_i { ( { \\bf r)}}\\;\\ ; , \\\\ m{({\\bf r)}}&= & \\sum \\psi^+_i { ( { \\bf r)}}{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}\\sigma_z \\psi_i { ( { \\bf r)}}\\;\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath12 is a four - component one - electron dirac spinor .",
    "the matrices @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the standard dirac matrices while @xmath15 is the vector of the 4@xmath164 pauli matrix .",
    "the spin - polarized relativistic lmto method @xcite was used to calculate the spin and orbital magnetic moments .",
    "the hamiltonian and overlap matrices corresponding to eq .",

    "self - consistent relativistic calculations were performed for the electronic and magnetic properties of periodic multilayers consisting of @xmath29fe(001)/@xmath30(@xmath7 ) where @xmath7 can be ta , w , re , os , ir , pt , or au . the layers were constructed to be consistent with the bcc structure .",
    "the layer thickness @xmath29 of fe took on the values @xmath29=3 and 5 while the layer thickness @xmath30 of @xmath7 has the values @xmath30=1 , 3 , 5 , and 7 .",
    "basis sets with @xmath31 were used for both fe and @xmath7 .",
    "convergence tests were performed to determine the influence of the inclusion of the higher angular momentum basis states , @xmath32 , and the values of the magnetic moments were found to be well converged with the inclusion of the @xmath32 states changing the values of the spin and orbital moments typically by less than 0.01 and 0.003 @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "the planar lattice constant of bcc fe was used for both the fe and the @xmath7 layers .",
    "perpendicular to the planes the lattice parameter of fe was used for the fe layers , while for @xmath7 the lattice parameter perpendicular to the planes was determined such that the volume around @xmath7 was equal to the experimental volume for the elemental @xmath7 system .",
    "this procedure was used to model the relaxation of the lattice at the interface .",
    "in fig .  [ lsthickness ] the variations of the spin and orbital moments are shown as a function of w thickness for a fixed fe thickness of 5 layers .",
    "the numerical values can be found in table  [ qtab1 ] .",
    "note that at the fe side of the fe / w interface the spin moment is decreased in comparison with the other fe layers , whilst the orbital moment shows a strong enhancement in the interface layer . on the w side of the interface , a spin moment on w",
    "is induced by the fe which is aligned antiparallel .",
    "this w moment shows an oscillatory behavior , becoming aligned to the fe spin moment in the two subsequent w layers and antiparallel again in the fourth layer .",
    "the w orbital moments are initially aligned antiparallel to the fe orbital moment and become parallel from the third w layer onwards .",
    "from these results it can be seen that in the w interface layer the spin and orbital magnetic moments are parallel aligned demonstrating that hund s third rule is violated as reported by the experimental work of ref .  .",
    "this can also be seen in table  [ qtab1 ] where for 5fe/7w the w1 interface and w3 layers show a violation of hund s third rule whereas layers w2 and w4 have spin and orbital magnetic moment anti - parallel aligned .",
    "table  [ qtab1 ] also relates the trends in spin and orbital magnetic moments to charge transfer .",
    "the charge transfer at the interface can be sizeable for all systems considered : the 5fe / w , 5fe/3w , 5fe/5w and 5fe/7w systems . from the distribution of the fe and w electrons into d and sp channels , we see that for fe the spin magnetic moment contribution from the sp electrons is antiparallel to the contribution from the d electrons .",
    "this is what one would expect from fe .",
    "however , for w , these contributions are parallel and are in accordance with a magnetic moment induced by hybridization with fe . actually , the contribution of the sp electrons is as large as @xmath34 of the total spin moment .",
    "one can also see that the induced spin magnetic moment is largest on the w1 interface layer where the hybridization with fe is most sizeable .",
    "the oscillations of the spin moments in the w layers are further analysed in fig .",
    "[ centroid ] where the centroid positions of the spin - up ( majority ) and spin - down ( minority ) @xmath2 bands are presented for each of the layers of 5fe/3w .",
    "the reduction of the fe spin moment at the interface can be seen to be caused by the centroid position of the minority spin band lowering its energy . for the w layers the centroid positions of the spin bands lie above the fermi energy ( @xmath3 ) and a small splitting of these",
    "is induced .",
    "this splitting between the spin - up and spin - down bands reverses sign from the w interface layer to the next w layer .",
    "the sign of the spin moment in the w interface layer being aligned antiparallel to fe is a consequence of the fe - w hybridization across the interface . the minority fe @xmath2 bands lie energetically close to the minority w bands and a relatively pronouned hybridization between these bands develops .",
    "this pulls the w minority @xmath2 bands down in energy .",
    "in contrast the majority fe and w @xmath2 bands are energetically well separated and substantially less hybridization occurs .",
    "consequently , the w minority d bands are pulled down in energy .",
    "therefore these w minority d bands will be preferentially occupied and this allows a w spin magnetic moment , opposite in sign to that of fe , to develop .",
    "figure  [ dos ] further demonstrates the hybridization of fe and w at the interface .",
    "it shows the layer decomposed dos for the 5fe/5w system .",
    "whilst in fe and w layers away from the interface the dos resembles that of bulk fe and w , respectively , a substantial hybridization at the interface is noted . in particular",
    "the minority fe @xmath2 band loses structure and its center of mass is shifted to lower energy .",
    "the majority and minority fe @xmath2 bands in the energy region of @xmath3 and 0.2 ry below @xmath3 hybridise strongly with the w @xmath2 bands , creating in the spin - resolved w @xmath2 bands a similar depletion and increase as in the fe dos .",
    "this hybridization rapidly disappears in subsequent w layers .",
    "these results are in contrast with the findings of ref .   where for gd / w multilayers no hybridization - induced spin polarization in the w layer is reported and spin polarization is only found to occur as a consequence of expanding the volume around the w sites sufficiently to induce a volume prompted spin polarization . from the present study",
    "we see that hybridization of @xmath2 electrons at the interface between fe , which has a substantial spin moment of 2.2 @xmath33 , and w induces the w spin polarization . in the case of gd",
    "the spin polarization of the @xmath2 states is small ( 0.5 to 0.6 @xmath33 ) and this seems to be insufficient to induce spin polarization via hybridization .",
    "this argumentation was checked by performing calculations for ni / w multilayers where ni has roughly the same spin polarization as the gd @xmath2 band .",
    "additional differences between the calculations are that fe / w , gd / w , and ni / w multilayers have bcc , hcp , and fcc superstructures , respectively . our calculations found that ni induced a much smaller spin moment of 0.005 @xmath33 in the w layers .",
    "the different crystal structures are presumably responsible for inducing a spin moment for w on ni but not for w on gd .      whilst we have established conclusively that the spin magnetic moment on w is induced through hybridization , the oscillatory behaviour of the w spin magnetic moment needs more careful consideration . in table",
    "i we compare charge - transfer modulations with the oscillation in the spin magnetic moment layer by layer .",
    "the charge - transfer modulation varies as @xmath35 whilst the spin magnetic moment varies as @xmath36 and the orbital magnetic moment as @xmath37 .",
    "this means that hund s third rule is violated in layers 1 and 3 , whilst not in layers 2 and 4 .",
    "this is a striking result emphasizing an oscillatory behaviour in the violation of hund s third rule .",
    "actually , this demonstrates that it is not very meaningful to discuss the behaviour of the spin and orbital magnetic moments in terms of hund s third rule .",
    "the striking feature of this work is the sign of the induced orbital magnetic moment in the w interface layer . to determine the robustness of this feature we plot in fig .",
    "[ filling ] the spin and orbital moments as a function of energy for a 5fe(001)/3w multilayer . at the energy position of @xmath3 ( @xmath38 ) the proper value of the spin and orbital moments in the interface w layer",
    "are @xmath390.113 and @xmath390.031 , respectively .",
    "we see that for `` bulk '' fe ( fe@xmath40 ) the spin and orbital moments are aligned , the spin moment is positive for all energies and the orbital moment changes sign around @xmath41 ry .",
    "this would imply that if we reduce the number of electrons in the system and in this manner model the lower z systems , i.e.moving towards and lower than half filling , the spin and orbital moment would become antiparallel aligned , consistent with hund s third rule .",
    "all fe layers possess this behavior . in the w layers",
    "the spin moments as a function of band filling show an oscillatory behavior , very different from what was noticed in fe .",
    "moreover this oscillatory behavior is very different between the w interface layer and the next w layer .",
    "the orbital moments also oscillates as a function of band filling and the simple cross - over from negative to positive values as seen in fe and shown to be consistent with hund s third rule , does not occur .",
    "hence , the behavior can be seen to be a consequence of hybridization between the @xmath7 and fe and has no resemblance to hund s third rule behavior .",
    "the spin and orbital moments as well as the charge transfer for 5fe(001)/3(@xmath7 ) , where @xmath7 is ta , w , or re , is displayed in fig .",
    "the numerical values are given in table  [ qtab2 ] .",
    "judging from the reduction of the fe spin moment at the interface , the hybridization of ta with fe is strongest . apart from this ,",
    "the behavior of the spin moments as a function of layers is similar for ta , w , and re .",
    "the figure shows that the oscillations in the charge transfer do follow the oscillations in the spin moments .",
    "however , concerning the orbital moments their behavior varies from ta to w to re . for the 5fe/3ta",
    "there is no sign change in the multilayer at all . in the case of 5fe/3re",
    "the oscillation of the orbital moment does follow the oscillations in the spin moments . for this system",
    "hund s rule is not violated either : in both re layers the spin and orbital moments are aligned .",
    "it is remarkable to see how complicated the behavior of the orbital moment is as a function of atomic number and layer index , whilst we note again the correlation between oscillations in the spin magnetic moment and the charge oscillations .",
    "this complicated behavior of the orbital moments in ta , w , and re and also as a function of layer index should not come anymore as a surprise given the complex behavior seen in fig .",
    "[ filling ] as a function of energy or band filling .",
    "in particular by considering the energy scales in w1 and w2 of fig .  [ filling ] marked by a dashed box , we can see that for a reduced energy at the lower end of the box the orbital magnetic moment would become positive in both w1 and w2 . in a rigid band fashion",
    "this would correspond to ta . increasing the energy towards the upper end of the box",
    "one can see that the orbital magnetic moment can remain negative in w1 but can become positive in w2 .",
    "the system that we consider is a three - layer system incorporated in an fe host .",
    "this three - layer system is repeated periodically with the structure 5fe(001)/3(@xmath7 ) .",
    "whilst such a geometry is far removed from a @xmath7 impurity in an fe host , comparison with calculations for such systems could be instructive .",
    "figure  [ 5dseries ] shows the spin and orbital moments obtained for the 5fe/3(@xmath7 ) multilayer systems and the @xmath7 impurity calculations from ref .  .",
    "the spin moments of @xmath7 impurities in fe are antiparallel aligned for the first part of the @xmath0 transition metal series , i.e.  for the @xmath7 with less than half filling . from os",
    "onwards the spin moments of the @xmath7 impurity and fe become aligned .",
    "this is for the same reasons as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : a ] .",
    "for @xmath7 impurities to obey hund s third rule the orbital moments would have to be positive throughout this @xmath7 series ( c.f .",
    "[ hund ] for the atomic case ) .",
    "this is not the case and the orbital moments are negative for re , os , ir ; so that in these calculations hund s rule is violated for os and ir .",
    "the spin and orbital moment curves for the multilayers show the same behavior as for the impurity . for the spin moment",
    "the multilayer and the impurity calculation switch between parallel and antiparallel alignment at the same location .",
    "the orbital moments which are more sensitive to the structure and chemical environment switch between parallel and antiparallel at slightly different locations , making the orbital moments negative for w , re , and os . therefore , hund s rule is not only violated for w but also for os as was also the case for the single impurity .",
    "figure  [ filling ] reinforces this universal band filling scenario . when analyzing the orbital moment in the w interface layer ( w@xmath42 ) as a function of band filling in the vicinity of @xmath3 ( the area in fig .",
    "[ filling ] marked by the box ) we see that moving away from @xmath3 to lower energy the orbital moment changes sign .",
    "moving from @xmath3 to lower energy in fig .  [ filling ] means , in a rigid - band manner , mimicking lower z such as ta and therefore modelling the z lower than w in fig .  [ 5dseries ] . moving from @xmath3 up in energy in fig .  [ filling ]",
    "also models the behavior of the orbital moment in fig .",
    "[ 5dseries ] , but now for z larger than w. therefore , we see that the behavior of the orbital moment as a function of z as shown in fig .",
    "[ 5dseries ] is present in the behavior of the orbital magnetic moment of the w interface layer as a function of band filling ( boxed area in fig .  [ filling ] ) .",
    "moreover , a similar behavior can also be noted from fig .  [ filling ] in the layer w@xmath43 , adjacent to the interface layer .",
    "the difference is that the area where the orbital moment is negative has been reduced . as a consequence re , which is just after w in the periodic table and",
    "can be modelled in a rigid band fashion by moving up @xmath3 , has a negative orbital moment in the interface layer but a positive orbital moment in the adjacent w@xmath43 layer ( fig .",
    "[ slq ] ) .",
    "this implies that the energy has moved up in such a manner that the orbital moment in the interface remains negative but at the same time has moved up sufficiently to reach energies where the sign change in the orbital moment of the w@xmath43 occurs ( @xmath440.05 ry ) .",
    "moving @xmath3 down by roughly the same amount ( 0.05 ry ) to model ta leads to positive orbital moments in both the interface and the adjacent layer , in agreement with the observed behavior of fig .",
    "[ slq ] .",
    "if the band filling is the crucial ingredient in determining the behavior of the orbital moments as a function of z for the @xmath7 in fe , then we would expect a similar behavior for the @xmath6 in fe . in fig .",
    "[ 4dseries ] we show the induced spin and orbital magnetic moments for the @xmath6 obtained for a 5fe/3(@xmath6 ) system .",
    "the spin moment is aligned antiparallel to fe in the first part of the transition metal series and becomes parallel aligned from rh onwards .",
    "again this is a consequence of hybridization as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : a ] and therefore the @xmath6 shows the same behavior as a function of band filling as the @xmath7 .",
    "also the orbital magnetic moment shows the same trends in the @xmath6 as in the @xmath7 , namely from parallel to antiparallel and again to parallel with respect to the fe orbital moment with zero crossings at mo and ru .",
    "these @xmath1 elements are isoelectronic with w and os , and the zero crossings in the @xmath7 occur between ta and w and between os and ir .",
    "this shows that the zero crossings are only slightly different in the @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "in particular , the loci of zero orbital magnetic moment are shifted and the region of negative orbital magnetic moment is larger for the @xmath0 series than for the @xmath1 series .",
    "the loci of zero orbital magnetic moment for the @xmath6 impurity occur at slightly higher values that for the @xmath6 interface .",
    "this trend is consistent with the difference between impurity and interface of the @xmath7 series as seen in fig .",
    "[ 5dseries ] .",
    "this indicates that the geometrical differences between impurity and interface alter in a consistent way the loci of zero orbital magnetic moment to higher z in the impurity for both the @xmath6 and @xmath7 series .    for the @xmath7 impurity the zero crossings are between w and re , and between ir and pt .",
    "the similar behavior of these orbital moments as a function of z with only small changes between the @xmath7 impurity and interface , and between the @xmath6 impurity and interface demonstrates that band filling determines these properties .",
    "we have presented a systematic study of the interfacial spin and orbital magnetic moments over the entire @xmath6 and @xmath7 series .",
    "so far only an extrapolation from two experimental points , namely ir and w , existed @xcite .    for w / fe(001 ) systems with different w layer thicknesses we found that in the fe interface layer the fe spin moment is reduced whilst its orbital moment is approximately doubled .",
    "in the w layers a spin moment is induced which is antiparallel to that of fe in the first and fourth w layers but parallel to fe in the second and third w layers .",
    "the w orbital moment does not follow the spin moment .",
    "it is aligned antiparallel to fe in the first two w layers and changes sign in the third and fourth w layers .",
    "the calculations show that small changes in the band filling can lead to a reversal of the orbital moment of the first w layer .",
    "hence , the behavior can be seen as a consequence of the hybridization between w and fe which is mainly due to band filling , and to a lesser extent geometrical effects of either single impurity or interface . in comparison with impurity calculations we found that the trend in the spin and orbital moments over the @xmath1 and @xmath0 series is quite similar .",
    "the number of zero crossings is the same for the interface and impurity calculations , again suggesting that the behavior is primarily due to band filling .",
    "furthermore , for the @xmath6 interface we find the same behavior as for the @xmath7 , despite the fact that the spin - orbit interaction of the @xmath1 electrons is much smaller than for @xmath0 electrons .",

    "<S> these observations strongly suggest that these effects can be seen as a consequence of the hybridization between @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) and fe which is mostly due to band filling , and to a lesser extent geometrical effects of either single impurity or interface . </S>"
