    "it could be biased by nuclear two - body effects which were ignored in the nmc analysis .",
    "while shadowing effects @xcite cause the real value of the gottfried sum rule to be even smaller than the value given by nmc , the anti - shadowing effect , due to the presence of virtual mesons which bound the deuteron , tends to restore the classical value @xcite .",
    "a recent unfolding of the shadowing and anti - shadowing effects @xcite suggest , however , a genuine violation . this can be understood as consequence of an internal asymmetry @xmath2 of the quarks in the proton ( the opposite asymmetry is expected for the neutron if the proton - neutron charge symmetry holds ) .",

    "the idea of the @xmath0 asymmetry is not new .",
    "it was considered a decade ago by ito et al.@xcite as a possible explanation for the slope of the rapidity distribution of dilepton production in the proton - pt collision at fermilab . an alternative interpretation stimulated by the discovery of the emc effect invoked the enhancement of the nuclear sea in pt with respect to a collection of free nucleons @xcite .",

    "one has to rely on phenomenological models consistent with our knowledge in other branches of hadronic physics .",
    "the meson cloud model @xcite seems to satisfy this criterion .",
    "furthermore it is worth mentioning in this context that importance of pion loop effects for nucleon properties has been demonstrated in a recent lattice qcd calculation @xcite .",
    "in this section we briefly sketch the meson cloud model ( mcm ) of the nucleon@xcite and present its prediction for the asymmetry of the light sea antiquarks . in this model",

    "of course , in the deep inelastic regime at higher @xmath3 additional sea of perturbative nature is created unavoidably by the standard qcd evolution .",
    "the model includes all the mesons and baryons required in the description of the low energy nucleon - nucleon and hyperon - nucleon scattering , i.e. the @xmath66 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and the @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "in contrast to other approaches in the literature the model ensures charge conservation , baryon number and momentum sum rules @xcite by construction .",
    "the main ingredients of the model are the vertex coupling constants , the parton distribution functions for the virtual mesons and baryons and the vertex form factors which account for the extended nature of the hadrons .",
    "the coupling constants are assumed to be related via @xmath77 symmetry which seems to be well established from low - energy hyperon - nucleon scattering .",

    "the probability of the fock components with strange particles is rather small .",
    "for instance the probability to find a @xmath87 state in the nucleon is about 1% , whereas the probability to find a @xmath7 state is @xmath88 . in all applications in the present paper",
    "the higher fock states involving strange particles can be neglected .",

    "it is desirable to consider ratios @xcite rather than the absolute cross sections .",

    "we show the @xmath68-factors calculated according to the formalism developed in ref.@xcite for two different leading order quark distributions @xcite .",
    "although the @xmath68-factor depends on the input quark distribution as well as on @xmath138 and @xmath139 its value is practically identical for proton - proton and proton - neutron collisions .",
    "the approximate equality @xmath140 allows us to neglect the higher order corrections and limit ourselves to the much simpler leading order analysis .",

    "these ratios have been measured by the e772 collaboration at fnal@xcite for carbon , calcium , iron and tungsten targets .",

    "the second is related to the violation of the proton - neutron isospin symmetry .",
    "there are no a priori reasons , except of customs of practitioners in deep - inelastic scattering , for either symmetry to be more fundamental .",
    "both gsr violation and negative drell - yan asymmetry can in principle be explained by either @xmath188 ( @xmath2 ) or / and @xmath189 ( more abundant neutron than proton sea ) symmetry violation .",
    "some theoretical arguments @xcite suggest , however , that the violation of the @xmath31 symmetry seems to be more probable . while at present models explaining the @xmath0 asymmetry have been constructed , no reliable models explaining the proton - neutron isospin symmetry violation exist .",
    "the proton - neutron symmetry violation can be expected on the basis of the bag models as due to the mass difference of the @xmath190 and @xmath191 quarks as well as the corresponding di - quark states . at present a reasonable results",
    "can only be obtained for the valence quarks @xcite , which , however , has no influence on the gsr violation and rather little effect for the drell - yan asymmetry at the experimentally measured @xmath192 .",
    "the old concept of the meson cloud in the nucleon gives a natural explanation of the @xmath0 asymmetry .",
    "the essential parameters of the model  coupling constants  are well known from the low - energy physics . if the remaining parameters of the model ( cut - off parameters of the vertex form factors ) are fixed from the high - energy neutron and @xmath49 production @xcite then both the gsr violation and the drell - yan asymmetry can be well described .",
    "the same model gives also a good description of the neutron electric form factor @xcite . in our model",
    "the virtual mesons influence the static properties of the nucleon ( axial vector coupling constant @xcite , electromagnetic radii @xcite , etc . ) .",
    "our model has to be contrasted to the solution of ball and forte@xcite where mesons are produced radiatively via modified altarelli - parisi equations .",
    "therefore their approach predicts strong dependence of the gottfried sum rule on the scale , in the range of intermediate @xmath3 . in our approach",
    "the gottfried sum rule is constant , at least in the leading logarithm approximation",
    ". it would be very important to test these two scenarios experimentally .",
    "a preliminary evaluation of the nmc data seems to support rather our model @xcite .",
    "we have discussed possibilities to identify the @xmath193 asymmetry through the observation of the dilepton pairs in the hadronic collisions .",
    "the analysis of the present @xmath194 pair creation data in proton - nucleus scattering is not conclusive .",
    "the rapidity slope , very sensitive to the flavour asymmetry , depends also on the valence quark distributions .",
    "the ratio of the cross section in proton - nucleus to that in proton - deuteron collision is compatible with symmetric sea quark distributions .",
    "however , the case of asymmetry concentrated at rather small @xmath9 is not excluded .",
    "the meson cloud model gives results compatible with the e772 fermilab experimental data @xcite .",
    "elementary nucleon - nucleon drell - yan processes seem to be much better suited to study the @xmath182 asymmetry .",
    "the presence of virtual mesons in the nucleon , especially pions , can explain the new result of the na51 group at cern for the drell - yan asymmetry .",
    "the drell - yan asymmetry is a quantity fairly insensitive to the valence quark distribution and very sensitive to the flavour asymmetry of the sea .",
    "the drell - yan asymmetries obtained with different valence quark distributions and symmetric sea are similar and positive .",
    "the meson cloud model predicts negative @xmath170 , which is consistent with the only existing experimental data point @xcite .",
    "furthermore it gives definite prediction for the @xmath9 dependence of the flavour asymmetry , awaiting experimental verification .",
    "the new experiment planned at fermilab @xcite will open such a possibility ."
