    "external fields represent an excellent tool to influence and control the motion of quantum systems and in particular to generate new , sometimes very surprising , properties of e.g. atoms and molecules . in the case of static homogeneous magnetic fields",
    "the interest in the electronic structure of the hydrogen atom reached its maximum in the late 1980 s @xcite .",
    "this was motivated on the one hand by the experimental accessibility of highly excited rydberg states via laser spectroscopy as well as the astronomical observation of spectra from magnetic white dwarfs possessing a hydrogen - rich atmosphere @xcite . on the other hand the development of new numerical techniques allowed to address the regime where the competition of the coulomb and diamagnetic interaction leads to unusual and complex properties and phenomena .",
    "besides the vivid interest in magnetized structures the hydrogen atom served as a paradigm of a nonseparable and nonintegrable system possessing major impact with respect to the development of several fields such as quantum chaos , semiclassics of nonintegrable systems and nonlinear dynamics in general ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in contrast to the case of a homogeneous magnetic field there exist no investigations on the electronic structure and properties of atoms in inhomogeneous or trapping magnetic field configurations . apart from the fact that this problem is of fundamental interest , experimental techniques allow nowadays to manufacture magnetic microtraps on atom chips @xcite .",
    "the latter consists of surface - mounted structures carrying microscopic charges and/or currents which create a miniature landscape of inhomogeneous electric and/or magnetic fields .",
    "in particular it is possible to build tight magnetic traps which involve magnetic field configurations with large field gradients up to @xmath0 .",
    "since these traps strongly confine the atoms it is to be expected that the electronic structure of excited or highly excited rydberg states is influenced significantly by the spatially varying field .",
    "quadrupole magnetic fields represent a key configuration which is used in many setups of traps .",
    "we therefore investigate here the electronic structure of atoms exposed to a quadrupole magnetic field ( see also ref.@xcite ) .",
    "in detail we proceed as follows . in section [ sec : hamiltonian ] we present the electronic hamiltonian of the atom in the quadrupole field including the interaction of the spatial as well as spin degrees of freedom with the external field .",
    "section [ sec : symmetries ] contains a discussion of the remarkable spin - spatial symmetries of the hamiltonian including unitary as well as antiunitary symmetries and the related constants of motion . as a result",
    "we encounter a two - fold degeneracy of each eigenstate .",
    "section [ sec : j_z_eigenstates ] discusses the eigenstates obeying different symmetries and the resulting consequences for expectation values of observables .",
    "section [ sec : computational_approach ] briefly outlines our computational approach . in section [ sec : results ] we present the results of our numerical investigations establishing new spectral and other properties for low - lying and highly excited states for weak and strong gradients .",
    "the spin expectation values and in particular the spatial distribution of the spin polarization of the excited states are studied in detail .",
    "electromagnetic transitions in the quadrupole field including dipole strengths and wavelengths are given too .",
    "whereever appropriate a comparison with the case of a homogeneous magnetic field is performed .",
    "finally the peculiar property of magnetic field - induced permanent electric dipole moments is derived and investigated in depth .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion_outlook ] contains the conclusions and outlook as well as some discussion of relevant aspects going beyond the present investigation .",
    "in ultracold atomic physics moving atoms in inhomogeneous magnetic fields are considered to be neutral point - like particles which couple only through their total angular momentum to the external field @xcite . in slowly varying magnetic fields it is appropriate and convenient to describe the dynamics of the atoms by means of an adiabatic approximation , where one assumes that the magnetic moment is oriented either parallel or antiparallel to the magnetic field . in this way",
    "the interaction potential becomes proportional to the modulus of the magnetic field .",
    "as long as the spatial extent of the atom is much less than the typical variations of the field and if one is only interested in the center of mass motion of the atom the adiabatic approximation can be applied reliably .    in the present investigation",
    "we are interested in the electronic structure of excited atoms exposed to a quadrupole magnetic trap or field .",
    "therefore we have to go beyond the above approximation in the sense that the detailed coupling of both the electronic spatial as well as the spin degrees of freedom to the external field is taken into account .",
    "the majority of todays experiments on ultracold atoms deal with alkali - atoms @xcite .",
    "alkali - atoms become rapidly hydrogen - like if their single valence electron is excited .",
    "the detailed structure of the core becomes increasingly irrelevant with increasing degree of excitation .",
    "we therefore assume that the outer electron is exposed to the field of a single positive point charge .",
    "furthermore we neglect the spin - orbit ( @xmath1 ) coupling and the coupling of the nuclear and electronic spin , i.e. the hyperfine interaction .",
    "these interactions show an @xmath2-dependence , i.e. a rapid decay with increasing @xmath3 .",
    "thus for sufficient highly excited states their contributions are negligible compared to those of the coulomb - potential and the interaction with the external field .",
    "nevertheless one can discuss how the inclusion of spin - orbit coupling might modify the properties of the system .",
    "for hydrogen in a homogeneous field this relativistic effect changes the symmetries of the system crucially : @xmath4 and @xmath5 are no longer conserved separately and only @xmath6 remains a conserved quantity .",
    "the result is a restructuring of the energy spectrum since previously separated symmetry sub - spaces become coupled . in particular",
    "this manifests itself in the emergence of avoided crossing @xcite . for the atom in the quadrupole field such dramatic effects",
    "are not expected since the additional @xmath1-coupling term does not reduce the symmetry of the system .",
    "additionally , considering its @xmath2-dependence , the spin - orbit interaction can certainly be treated by means of perturbation theory in the regime of spatially extensive and energetically highly excited rydberg states .    in the presence of a magnetic field the motion of the center of mass ( cm ) and internal ( electronic ) degrees of freedom of an atom",
    "do not decouple .",
    "this holds in particular for the case of a homogeneous magnetic field @xcite and therefore has also to be expected for an inhomogeneous field .",
    "however , cm - motional effects on the electronic structure become only significant in certain parameter and/or energetic regimes @xcite . in order to approximately decouple the cm and electronic dynamics we take advantage of the heavy atomic mass compared to the electron mass ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "additionally we assume an ultracold atom whose cm motion takes place on much larger time scales than the electron dynamics , even for highly excited electronic states .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the electronic motion then reads @xmath8 where we have assumed that the atomic core ( nucleus ) is fixed at the trap center which is the origin of the coordinate system .",
    "the magnetic quadrupole field is given as @xmath9 the gradient @xmath10 is the only parameter characterizing the steepness of the quadrupole trap .",
    "the vector field is rotationally symmetric around the @xmath11-axis and invariant under the @xmath11-parity operation .    ) .",
    "the intersections are the @xmath12-plane for @xmath13 ( * a * ) and the @xmath14-plane for @xmath15 ( * b*).,title=\"fig:\",width=253 ] ) .",
    "the intersections are the @xmath12-plane for @xmath13 ( * a * ) and the @xmath14-plane for @xmath15 ( * b*).,title=\"fig:\",width=253 ]    figure [ fig : quad_field ] shows intersections of this vector field for @xmath13 and @xmath15 , correspondingly .",
    "a vector potential belonging to the quadrupole field reads @xmath16=b\\left(% \\begin{array}{c }    yz \\\\    -xz",
    "\\\\    0 \\\\ \\end{array } \\right),\\label{eq : vector_potential}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is a coulomb gauge ( @xmath17 ) . in cartesian coordinates and adopting atomic units , @xmath18 , @xmath19 : the magnetic gradient unit then becomes @xmath20 .",
    "the magnetic field strength unit is @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) the spinor hamiltonian ( [ eq : spinor_hamiltonian ] ) becomes @xmath23 with @xmath24 and @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 being the pauli spin matrices ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the first two terms of @xmath29 in equation ( [ eq : hamiltonian_rc=0_cart ] ) represent the hamiltonian of the hydrogen atom without external fields .",
    "the third term is the paramagnetic ( @xmath30 ) or zeeman - term .",
    "in contrast to the situation of the atom in a homogeneous field this term now depends not only on @xmath5 but also linearly on the @xmath11-coordinate .",
    "the fourth ( diamagnetic ) term ( @xmath31 ) represents a quartic oscillator coupling term between the cylindrical coordinates @xmath32 and @xmath11 . in a homogeneous field",
    "the diamagnetic interaction is a pure harmonic oscillator term proportional to @xmath33 and yields a confinement perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "finally the reader should note that the coupling of the electronic spin to the quadrupole field depends linearly on the cartesian coordinates .",
    "the latter prevents the factorization of the motions in the spin and spatial degrees of freedom and renders the corresponding schrdinger equation into a spinor equation .",
    "this is again in contrast to the situation of a homogeneous magnetic field where the spin component along the field is a conserved quantity .",
    "in this section we investigate the unitary as well as the anti - unitary symmetries and conserved quantities of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian_rc=0_cart ] ) .",
    "we will then construct the corresponding eigenfunctions respecting these symmetries .",
    "this will help us ( in section [ eq : jz_eigenfunction ] ) to derive properties of expectation values .",
    "some basic definitions and features of probability densities are also introduced being utilized later to analyze excited atomic states in the quadrupole field .    for the following discussion it is useful to transform the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian_rc=0_cart ] ) into spherical coordinates .",
    "it reads @xmath34 with @xmath35 being the matrix @xmath36 as a consequence of the rotational invariance of the quadrupole field the @xmath11-component of the total angular momentum @xmath37 is conserved , i.e. we have @xmath38=0 $ ] .",
    "additionally we have the discrete symmetry represented by the unitary operator @xmath39 , i.e. @xmath40=0 $ ] . here",
    "exchanges the components of a @xmath42-spinor , @xmath43 is the @xmath11-parity operator @xmath44 and @xmath45 represents the reflection @xmath46 .",
    "apart from these symmetries the hamiltonian possesses two generalized anti - unitary time reversal symmetries namely @xmath47 and @xmath48 . both of them involve the conventional time reversal operator @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) , which corresponds to complex conjugation .",
    "applying the two anti - unitary operators @xmath47 and @xmath48 results in the unitary operation @xmath51 .",
    "the operators @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath51 form an invariant abelian sub - group .",
    "together with @xmath6 they obey the following ( anti-)commutation rules : @xmath52=\\left\\{j_z , top_z\\right\\}=\\left\\{j_z , p_\\phi op_z\\right\\}=0\\\\ \\left[tp_\\phi , top_z\\right]=\\left[tp_\\phi , p_\\phi op_z\\right]=\\left[p_\\phi op_z , top_z\\right]=0\\label{eq : top_pop_commutator}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] apparently the spin - spatial symmetry operations form a non - abelian symmetry group . this group generated by @xmath39 and @xmath6 is isomorphic to @xmath53 .    in the following",
    "we will show , that the interplay of the above symmetries leads to a degeneracy of the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian_rc=0_spher ] ) .",
    "we consider a state @xmath54 which is an eigenstate of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian_rc=0_spher ] ) with the energy @xmath55 and to @xmath6 with the half - integer quantum number @xmath56 ( see below ) .",
    "since @xmath47 commutes with @xmath57 the state @xmath58 is also an energy eigenstate with the energy @xmath55 . by letting @xmath6 act on this state one obtains @xmath59",
    "thus the state @xmath58 can be identified with @xmath60 .",
    "hence the states with the eigenvalues @xmath56 and @xmath61 are degenerate .",
    "this two - fold degeneracy of each energy level in the presence of the inhomogeneous magnetic field is a remarkable feature .",
    "it is reminiscent of the kramers degeneracy of spin @xmath42 systems in the absence of external fields @xcite .    in the case of an atom in a homogeneous magnetic field the operators @xmath5 , @xmath43 as well as parity @xmath62 and @xmath63 form the corresponding set of spatial and time reversal symmetries if the field is oriented along the @xmath11-axis .",
    "since these operators commute they form an abelian symmetry group implying the well - known fact that there are no energy level degeneracies in the homogeneous field .    in order to finalize this section",
    "we want to remark that most of the above considerations hold not only for the case of a fixed nucleus in the trap center but also for the full two - body problem .",
    "if the dynamics of both the nucleus and the electron is considered the conservation of @xmath48 , @xmath47 and @xmath6 of the two - body system holds .",
    "since the @xmath6 operator provides the eigenvalue equation @xmath64 with half - integer @xmath56 the spatial representation of the spinor eigenfunctions @xmath65 are @xmath66 the eigenfunction @xmath65 can be used to reduce the electron dynamics to a given @xmath56-subspace .",
    "the quantized motion of the electron is then described by the hamiltonian @xmath67 .",
    "we will exploit this fact later when solving the stationary schrdinger equation .",
    "eigenstates to the @xmath47-operator can be constructed by superimposing two degenerate @xmath6-eigenstates .",
    "they read @xmath68.\\label{eq : top - state}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the corresponding eigenvalue relation is @xmath69 eigenfunctions of the anti - unitary operator @xmath48 can be constructed analogously : @xmath70\\label{eq : tp - state}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the @xmath6- and @xmath47-eigenstates exhibit certain symmetry properties .",
    "exploiting such symmetries often turns out to be extremely powerful and can save a lot of computational effort .",
    "it is especially useful when one is interested in computing matrix elements such as expectation values of certain observables .",
    "the expectation value of an observable @xmath71 in an energy and @xmath6- eigenstate @xmath54 is defined as @xmath72 whereas for a @xmath47-eigenstate ( [ eq : top - state ] ) it reads @xmath73.\\label{eq : top_z_expectationvalue}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] + if @xmath71 satisfies the anti - commutation relation @xmath74 the first two terms of ( [ eq : top_z_expectationvalue ] ) cancel each other and we obtain @xmath75 = \\mp i\\,\\text{im}\\left(\\left < top_z\\,m\\right>_{j_z}\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the expectation value of an observable is always a real number it follows @xmath76 i.e. the expectation value of such an operator @xmath71 vanishes within any @xmath47-eigenstate .    in a similar manner one can calculate the expectation value of an observable @xmath77 , which commutes with @xmath6 and @xmath47 . here",
    "expression ( [ eq : top_z_expectationvalue ] ) yields @xmath78 exploiting @xmath79=0 $ ] and using @xmath80 one obtains @xmath81 hence @xmath82 leading to the final result @xmath83 i.e. we obtain equal expectation values of @xmath77 for a @xmath6- or @xmath47-eigenstate .",
    "finally we provide some relevant expressions for the spatial probability density @xmath84 in the different representations .",

    "we employ the linear variational principle @xcite to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian_rc=0_spher ] ) . the idea is to expand the exact eigenfunctions of the schrdinger equation in a complete basis set of spinor orbitals that converge efficiently and accurately towards the exact solution . calculating the expansion coefficients results in a large - scale algebraic eigenvalue equation .",

    "the energy eigenfunctions of the schrdinger equation computed with this basis set are a priori eigenfunctions of @xmath6 .",

    "an eigenstate @xmath54 of the stationary schrdinger equation can now be expanded in terms of the basis - functions ( [ eq : basis_set ] ) @xmath103 leading to the generalized spinor eigenvalue problem @xmath104 , where @xmath105 and @xmath106 are the corresponding matrix representation of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian_rc=0_spher ] ) and the overlap matrix , respectively : @xmath107 the vector @xmath108 contains the expansion coefficients of ( [ eq : expansion_of_state ] ) : @xmath109 the two off - diagonal blocks of @xmath106 vanish due to the orthogonality of the spin states @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "this does not hold for @xmath105 since the magnetic field leads to a coupling of the two spinor components .",
    "with the basis set ( [ eq : basis_set ] ) all entries of the matrices ( [ eq : hamiltonmatrix ] ) can be computed analytically .",
    "to do this we have exploited recurrence identities for the spherical harmonics and the laguerre polynomials @xcite . the matrices @xmath105 and @xmath106 possess a particular sparse appearance , e.g. @xmath106 is penta - diagonal , enabling us to go to large basis set dimensions .    in order to solve the above generalized eigenvalue problem we employ the arnoldi - method @xcite which is a so - called krylov - space method .",
    "this approach is especially suited for eigenvalue equations involving large sparse matrices .",
    "the arnoldi - method is perfectly suited to provide low - lying excited states with fairly small basis sets .",
    "to calculate highly excited states without computing the lower excited states we use the so called shift - and - invert method . here",

    "the eigenvalues @xmath55 of the original eigenvalue equation are connected to @xmath113 according to @xmath114 .",
    "thus eigenvalues lying close to the shift @xmath115 become the largest eigenvalues in magnitude of the operator @xmath116 .",
    "using the arnoldi - method these eigenvalues lying in a predefined energy range of the spectrum will converge first .",
    "the shift - and - invert method allows in principle to compute arbitrary parts of the spectrum of the hamiltonian ( @xmath117 ) by resetting the shift @xmath115 in successive calculations .",
    "thereby the basis parameter @xmath99 has to be adapted .",
    "a good choice is @xmath118 where @xmath55 is the lower boundary of the corresponding energy range .",
    "we remark that there is no need to change the parameter @xmath98 , which we always put to zero .    due to the hylleraas - undheim theorem @xcite",
    "the numerical approximate eigenvalues provide an upper bound for the exact eigenvalues . in order to check the convergence behavior we calculate a number of eigenvalues @xmath119 for a given basis set size @xmath120 . in a second step",
    "the size of the basis set is increased significantly to @xmath121 and the same eigenvalues are calculated again being now denoted by @xmath122 . as a measure of convergence",
    "we define the quantity @xmath123 where the difference of the same eigenvalue for the two basis sizes @xmath120 and @xmath121 is divided by the distance to the lower neighboring eigenvalue . for @xmath124",

    "the atoms exhibits unique features .",
    "the notion of a weak / strong gradient does not refer to an absolute field gradient but depends on the degree of excitation of the atom .",
    "it is defined to be the regime , for which the magnetic compared to the coulomb interaction is weak / strong . for weak gradients the level structure",
    "is dominated by the spin as well as the spatial zeeman - term both of which depend linearly on the field gradient .",

    "we have fixed the position of the cm of the atom at the center of the quadrupole field i.e. we have adopted an infinitely heavy nucleus . on the other hand assuming that an experimentally prepared atom is ultracold will certainly minimize the cm motional effects .",

    "<S> [ txt : abstract ] we investigate the electronic structure and properties of atoms exposed to a magnetic quadrupole field . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - spatial as well as generalized time reversal symmetries are established and shown to lead to a two - fold degeneracy of the electronic states in the presence of the field . </S>",
    "<S> low - lying as well as highly excited rydberg states are computed and analyzed for a broad regime of field gradients . the delicate interplay between the coulomb and various magnetic interactions leads to complex patterns of the spatial spin polarization of individual excited states . </S>",
    "<S> electromagnetic transitions in the quadrupole field are studied in detail thereby providing the selection rules and in particular the transition wavelengths and corresponding dipole strengths . </S>",
    "<S> the peculiar property that the quadrupole magnetic field induces permanent electric dipole moments of the atoms is derived and discussed . </S>"
