    "the linkage through susy can be utilized to construct exact solutions for various systems in quantum mechanics . recently",

    "the susy structure was also found in other physics fields besides quantum mechanics , e.g. , statistical physics through the fokker - planck equations @xcite . through the similarity between quantum - mechanical probability waves and electromagnetic waves ,",
    "the susy structure can be formulated for electromagnetic systems .",
    "electromagnetic susy structures have been found in one - dimensional refractive index distributions @xcite , coupled discrete waveguides @xcite , weakly guiding optical fibers with cylindrical symmetry @xcite , planar waveguides with varying permittivity and permeability @xcite , and non - uniform grating structures @xcite .",
    "even a quantum optical deformed oscillator with @xmath0 group symmetry and its susy partner were constructed as a classical electromagnetic system @xcite .",
    "the susy transformation generates new optical systems whose spectra coincide with those of the original system ( except possibly for the highest eigenvalue of the fundamental mode of original or generated systems ) .",
    "the susy transformations have been utilized to synthesize mode filters @xcite and distributed - feedback filters with any desired number of resonances at the target frequencies @xcite .",
    "the scattering properties of the optical systems paired by the susy transformation are related to each other @xcite .",
    "it is possible to design an optical system family with identical reflection and transmission characteristics by using the susy transformations @xcite .",
    "a reflectionless potential derived from the trivial system by susy transformation was applied to design transparent optical intersections @xcite . moreover",
    ", susy has also been intensively investigated in non - hermitian optical systems .",
    "if a system is invariant under the simultaneous operations of the space and time inversions , it is called @xmath1-symmetric . the susy transformation for the @xmath1-symmetric system",
    "allows for arbitrarily removing bound states from the spectrum @xcite .",
    "in addition , non - hermitian optical couplers can be designed @xcite . by using double susy transformations ,",

    ". the susy scattering properties of dielectric coupled waveguides have also been observed @xcite .",
