    "we present observations of 12 reported supernova remnants ( snrs ) selected from the 2006 version of green s snr catalogue made with the arcminute microkelvin imager small array ( ami sa , see @xcite and @xcite ) at 14.2 to 17.9ghz .",
    "the integrated flux densities from the ami sa observations are used in conjunction with measurements from the literature to investigate the synchrotron spectrum of these remnants .",
    "there are few observations of galactic snrs at frequencies above 10ghz , and several issues can be addressed by observing at higher frequencies . generally , observations over a wide range of frequencies are essential to investigate energy injection and loss processes in the intergalactic medium . more specifically , `",
    "filled - centre ' remnants have relatively flat , non - thermal spectra , with spectral indices @xmath1 typically between 0.0 and 0.3 ( here we define @xmath1 such that flux density @xmath2 varies with frequency @xmath3 as @xmath4 ) . such flat spectra steepen at high frequencies ; the positions of features such as spectral breaks , when known , vary considerably between different remnants ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the case of several filled - centre remnants",
    "the frequency of the turnover is not yet known .",
    "also , there have been suggestions ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) that ` shell ' type remnants , which typically have @xmath1 in the range 0.3 to 0.7 , show spectral flattening at higher frequencies .",
    "however , the detection of small changes in spectral index over a limited range of frequencies is not easy ( see e.g. @xcite ) , and observations over a wider range of frequencies is an advantage in such studies .",
    "finally , possible excess ` anomalous ' emission  which may be from spinning dust  has been reported in the case of one galactic snr ( 3c396 , @xcite ) .",
    "these ami sa observations provide additional constraints on any similar emission associated with the observed remnants .",
    "the ami sa is situated at the mullard radio astronomy observatory , cambridge .",
    "it consists of ten 3.7-m - diameter equatorially - mounted dishes with a baseline range of @xmath520 m .",
    "the telescope observes in the band 1218ghz with cryogenically - cooled indium - phosphide hemt front - end amplifiers .",
    "the system temperature is typically about 25  k. the astronomical signal is mixed with a 24-ghz local - oscillator signal to produce an intermediate - frequency signal of 612ghz . the correlator is an analogue fourier transform spectrometer with 16 correlations formed for each baseline at path delays spaced by approximately 26  mm . from these correlations ,",
    "the complex signals in each of eight channels of 750  mhz bandwidth are synthesized .",
    "note that for correlators of this type , the synthesized channels are correlated at the @xmath6 per cent level . in practice ,",
    "the lowest two frequency channels are presently unused due to a low response in this frequency range , and interference from geostationary satellites .",
    "the fwhm of the primary beam of the ami sa is @xmath7at 16ghz and the fwhm of its synthesised beam is at minimum @xmath8 .",
    "the average synthesized beam for a map made with combined frequency channels is shown in the figures presented in this paper , and is an effective measure of the resolution .",
    "observations of 12 reported snrs ( see table  [ tab : srclist ] ) were made with the ami sa during the period june ",
    "july 2007 .",
    "these targets were selected from green s snr catalogue on the basis of angular diameter ( @xmath9 , to be mapped in a single pointing ) and declination ( @xmath10 , to be accessible , given the hardware constraints at the time ) .",
    "the sample of snrs includes several bright , well - studied objects in the galactic anti - centre : ( 111.7)-(2.1 ) ( @xmath11cas  a ) , ( 120.1)+(1.4 ) ( @xmath11tycho s snr ) , ( 130.7)+(3.1 ) ( @xmath113c58 ) and ( 184.6)-(5.8 ) ( @xmath11crab nebula ) . comparison of ami sa maps , flux densities and spectra of these objects with data from the literature provides a useful verification of the performance of the telescope .",
    "the sample also includes less well studied objects , and indeed one has recently been revealed by @xcite as an hii region rather than a snr ( see further discussion of ( 84.9)+(0.5 ) below ) .",
    "the positions and effective thermal noise associated with each ami sa observation are shown in table  [ tab : srclist ] ; note that the noise levels for the brighter objects are limited by the dynamic range available .",
    "the observations were typically eight hours long and used interleaved observations of bright , nearby point sources at hourly intervals for phase calibration .",
    "the sensitivity of ami sa over all baselines , all channels , is @xmath12 giving @xmath13mjy after eight hours . given that the objects observed here are bright , eight hours is more than sufficient to obtain accurate flux densities ; however the long observations are important to produce good maps , whose structure is dependent on the @xmath14 coverage .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      @xmath15 fit to data above 11ghz .",
    "new observations in six channels spanning 14.217.9ghz have improved our knowledge of the spectral behaviour of eight supernova remnants in the northern sky .",
    "observations made of well - studied remnants confirm that ami sa is measuring flux densities accurately and our flux loss measurements and fitting methods are correct .",
    "for those sources for which a flux loss correction was made , table  [ tab : newsnralpha ] gives an interpolated flux density and spectral index from the ami data alone .",
    "the errors on the indices are relatively large , because of the limited frequency coverage of the telescope , but all values are consistent within one sigma with those calculated from the literature , except in the case of ( 74.9)+(1.2 ) , as our measurements lie above the spectral break frequency of 11ghz .",
    "we detect no anomalous excess emission from the observed snrs , implying there is no spinning dust present .",
    "( 54.1)+(0.3 ) shows a possible break in the ami sa band but , due to changes in large - scale structure over ami sa s frequency coverage , we will need data at higher frequencies to provide a definite answer .",
    "we thank the whole ami team for their invaluable assistance in the construction , commissioning and operation of ami .",
    "ami is supported by the stfc .",
    "nhw and mld acknowledge the support of pparc / stfc studentships ."
