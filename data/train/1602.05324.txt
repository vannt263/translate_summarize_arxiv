    "nowadays , optical cavities containing bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) , the so - called hybrid systems , have been considered as good candidates for investigation of atom - photon interaction in the regime where their quantum mechanical properties are manifested in the same level @xcite . besides , phenomena typical of solid - state physics like the formation of energy bands @xcite and bloch oscillations @xcite are clearly observable in these kinds of systems .    in these hybrid systems ,",
    "an effective optomechanical coupling @xcite arises due to the dispersive interaction of the bec matter field with the optical field of the cavity where the fluctuations of the atomic field of the bec ( the bogoliubov mode ) plays the role of the vibrational mode of the moving mirror in an optomechanical cavity @xcite .",
    "furthermore , due to the high density of atoms , the nonlinear effect of atom - atom interaction plays a very important role in systems consisting of bec @xcite .",
    "one of the interesting features of the optomechanical systems is the possibility of the normal - mode splitting ( nms ) , i.e. , the coupling of two degenerate modes with energy exchange taking place on a time scale faster than the decoherence of each mode @xcite .",
    "optomechanical nms may be taken into account in experiments that seek to demonstrate ground - state cooling which is possible in the resolved sideband regime , where the frequency of the mechanical mirror is much larger than the cavity decay rate @xcite .",
    "the more optomechanical coupling strength , the better the occurrence of ground - state cooling and nms .    in recent years",
    ", it has been shown that using the nonlinear media such as an optical parametric amplifier ( opa ) @xcite , an optical kerr medium @xcite or a combination of both @xcite lead to the enhancement of the radiation pressure - induced coupling .",
    "on the other hand , an interacting bec inside an optical cavity behaves like a nonlinear medium which possesses the nonlinear properties of both a kerr medium @xcite and an opa @xcite . in our two previous papers @xcite",
    "we have explicitly shown that an interacting bec behaves as a so - called atomic parametric amplifier , similar to an opa , where the condensate and the bogoliubov modes play , respectively , the roles of the pump field and the signal mode in the degenerate parametric amplifier and the _ s_-wave scattering frequency of atom - atom interaction plays the role of the nonlinear gain parameter .",
    "besides , it has been shown that these nonlinearities may affect the optical bistability of the cavity @xcite and change the threshold of the quantum phase transition of the bec @xcite .",
    "the above - mentioned investigations have been mostly concentrated on the influences of the nonlinear effects on the atomic field of the bec or on intracavity optical field .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , nowhere it has been addressed how the nonlinearity induced by the atomic collisions affects the power spectrum of the output field of the cavity which is measurable experimentally .",
    "addressing this question is the main theme of the present work .    in this paper",
    "we study the nonlinear effect of the atomic collisions on the output power spectrum of a driven optical cavity containing a trapped one - dimensional bec .",

    "nevertheless , increasing the atom - atom interaction cause the peaks of the intensity spectrum get nearer to the dips of the squeezing spectrum , as is observable in fig.[fig : fig6 ] . in other words , although the amount of the output squeezing for lower values of @xmath106 is somehow more than that of higher values , but this squeezing occurs where the intensity of the output field is very weak while for higher values of @xmath106 the maximum amount of squeezing occur where the output intensity is considerable .",
    "in this way one can assert that atomic collisions have positive effect on the production of squeezed light .     for @xmath81 and @xmath167 and for three different values of the _ s_-wave scattering frequency ( a ) @xmath168 , ( b ) @xmath90 , and ( c ) @xmath169 .",

    "in this paper , we have studied an interacting one - dimensional bec inside an optical cavity which is driven through one of the fixed end mirrors . under the bogoliubov approximation and when",
    "the number of photons inside the cavity is not too large , the atomic field operator can be considered as a single - mode quantum field which is coupled to the radiation pressure of the intracavity field . in this way",
    ", the system behaves like an optomechanical system with an extra nonlinear term corresponding to the atom - atom interaction .",
    "we have shown that one of the best ways of tracing the effect of atomic interaction is to study the phase noise power spectrum of the output field of the cavity .",
    "for this purpose , we studied the phase noise and intensity power spectra as well as the quadrature squeezing of the transmitted field of the optical cavity .",
    "the results reveal that the effect of atomic collisions is manifested as a change in the splitting between the normal modes of the system .",
    "however , this behavior can be observed much more clearly in the phase noise spectrum than that the intensity power spectrum . we have also derived a one - to - one correspondence between the amount of splitting between the normal modes of the transmitted field of the cavity and the _ s_-wave scattering frequency of the atomic collisions .",
    "therefore , by measuring the frequency splitting of the two peaks of the phase noise power spectrum which is experimentally feasible by the homodyne measurement of the light reflected by the cavity , one can estimate the value of _ s_-wave scattering frequency of the atoms .",
    "we have also examined the effect of atomic interactions on the squeezing behavior of the transmitted field of the cavity . based on our results ,",
    "although for lower values of the _ s_-wave scattering frequency the degree of squeezing is somehow larger , this squeezing occurs at the frequency in which the output intensity power spectrum is nearly zero ( the frequency of the bec mechanical mode ) . by increasing the _ s_-wave scattering frequency the peak position of the intensity power spectrum gets nearer to the frequency of the bec mechanical mode where the transmitted light is squeezed .",
    "it means that in order to achieve output light squeezing with considerable intensity one needs to increase the strength of atomic collisions .",
