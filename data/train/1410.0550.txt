    "the quantum walk ( qw )  @xcite was primarily devised as the quantum - mechanical version of the classical random walk , the stochastic process modeling the trajectory of a particle that at each time step moves , either leftward or rightward , a fixed distance in accordance with the outcome of a coin toss . in the quantum version ,",
    "the coin is related to some intrinsic degree of freedom in the system with a quantum nature and two exclusive values , a qubit : e.g. , the spin , the polarization or the chirality .",
    "it soon became clear that , beyond the formal resemblance , random and quantum walks show very different properties  @xcite , being perhaps the most striking of them the ability of qws to spread over the line , not as a diffusive process , but linearly in time  @xcite .",
    "this speed - up makes feasible the development of quantum algorithms that can solve problems in a more efficient way than their classic counterparts  @xcite .",
    "in particular , qws are promising tools in the optimal resolution of search problems  @xcite . nowadays ,",
    "qws have exceeded the scope of quantum computation and attracted the attention of many researchers from other fields as , for example , game theory  @xcite .",
    "in fact , refs .",
    "@xcite are paradigmatic instances that show how , fruit of this broad interest , diverse extensions of the discrete - time qw on the line have been considered in the past .",
    "most of these variations are related with the properties of the unitary coin operator , cornerstone of the new physical features of the system .",
    "thus , one can find in the literature qws whose evolution depends on more than one coin  @xcite , qws that suffer from decoherence  @xcite , or qws driven by inhomogeneous , site - dependent coins  @xcite , just to name a few .",
    "these all are examples of modified qws in which the coin changes with time in an implicit way .",
    "but there are also precedents where the temporal inhomogeneity of the qw is made absolutely explicit : in the form of a recursive rule for the coin selection , as in the so - called fibonacci qws  @xcite , though a given function that determines the value of the coin parameters  @xcite , or by means of a random process that controls the coin properties  @xcite .    from all of these previous works",
    ", it is in ref .",
    "@xcite where one can find more similarities with respect to the path we are going to follow in this paper . here",
    "we consider the evolution of a discrete - time qw on the line with a general , time - dependent coin .",
    "the generality in our analysis stems from the inclusion of the two phase factors that the unitary coin operator can incorporate , a caution that may become superfluous depending on the circumstances  @xcite . in the present case ,",
    "this generalization is essential : as the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite rightly pointed out , these phase factors can be used to induce new features in the qw ( like quasiperiodic behavior or dynamic localization ) but also as a control mechanism for compensating externally - induced decoherence .",
    "our contribution shares these two qualities as well : we show how the space evolution of the system remains unaltered from the probabilistic point of view if the phase factors are well tuned .",
    "thus , this nontrivial invariance is added to other known symmetries of the problem  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec_process ] we review the formalism used in the construction of the discrete - time quantum walk on the line with a time - dependent coin operator . in sec .",
    "[ sec_initial ] we provide explicit expressions for the initial stages of the evolution of the quantum state of the system .",
    "we analyze the mathematical structure of these formulas in sec .",
    "[ sec_changing_phases ] , and infer that invariant behavior can be obtained with the proper selection of the values of the parameters .",
    "we prove the general validity of this conjecture in sec .",
    "[ sec_invariance ] , and discuss the role of the two key magnitudes that appear along our study .",
    "the paper ends with sec .",
    "[ sec_conclusion ] where conclusions are drawn .",
    "we begin by introducing the building blocks of the time - dependent quantum walk on the line .",
    "we denote by @xmath0 the hilbert space of discrete particle positions in one dimension , spanned by the basis @xmath1 , and by @xmath2 the hilbert space of the coin states , spanned by the basis @xmath3 . in its most ubiquitous form , the discrete - time",
    ", discrete - space quantum walk on the hilbert space @xmath4 is the result of the action of the evolution operator @xmath5 , @xmath6 , which consists of some unitary operator @xmath7 that affects only the internal degree of freedom , the throw of the quantum dice , and a shift operator @xmath8 that _ moves _ the walker depending on the respective coin state : @xmath9    in our scheme , however , we break the temporal homogeneity of the process by assuming that the coin operator changes with time , @xmath10 , i.e. , @xmath11 . the most general form that operator @xmath12 can take according to its unitary nature reads  @xcite : @xmath13\\otimes\\hat{i}_p , \\label{u_coin_gen}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the identity operator defined in the position space @xmath0 , and @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are real magnitudes .",
    "in fact , as we consider that the time increases in discrete steps , one can always choose the time units so that the time variable @xmath18 is just an integer index",
    ". then the state of the system at a later time , @xmath19 , is recovered after the application of @xmath10 to the previous state : @xmath20 and the evolution of the system is fully determined once @xmath21 is set . here",
    "we assume that , at the beginning , the quantum walker is located at the origin but that the initial coin state is a general superposition : @xmath22    let us finally introduce two probabilistic magnitudes which will appear repeatedly along this paper .",
    "the first one is the probability mass function ( pmf ) of the process , @xmath23 , the probability that the walker is in a particular position @xmath24 at a given time @xmath18 : @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the identity operator of the coin space @xmath2 .",
    "the second one is the probability of obtaining the _ plus _ or _ minus _ value when measuring the coin state of the walker : @xmath28 with @xmath29",
    "we are now ready to determine the state of the system @xmath30 , for any value of @xmath18 , by means of eqs .   and",
    ". we might give specific values to @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and a rule for @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and thus @xmath30 could be computed numerically .",
    "instead of proceeding in this way , we are going to introduce the explicit expressions of @xmath30 for the lowest values of @xmath18 .",
    "as we will see , beyond the obvious limitations , this approach is very illustrative .",
    "thus , after the first time step the system is in the state given by @xmath33   |-\\rangle\\otimes | { -1}\\rangle , \\nonumber\\\\ & = & e^{i\\alpha_1 } a \\ , |+\\rangle\\otimes | 1\\rangle+e^{i\\beta_1 } b\\ ,   |-\\rangle\\otimes | { -1}\\rangle , \\label{psi_one}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 with @xmath35 , and @xmath36    in this case , only two sites in the line are accessible to the walker , i.e. , @xmath37 , @xmath38 which is nothing but the consequence of a well - known property of quantum walks of this kind : @xmath39 if @xmath40 , @xmath41 . the same expressions are obtained for the probabilities of the two possible outputs after a measure of the coin state of the system : @xmath42    the state of the system after the second time step is @xmath43 \\otimes | { 0}\\rangle\\nonumber\\\\ & -&e^{i(\\beta_1-\\alpha_2)}\\cos\\theta_2\\,b   |-\\rangle\\otimes | { -2}\\rangle , \\label{psi_two}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and depends on @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 . nonetheless , the pmf is independent of @xmath44 and @xmath45 , @xmath47 and the same applies for the probabilities of measuring any of the two possible values of the coin : @xmath48    this fact could lead to the impression that @xmath15 and @xmath16 bear no physical information and thus to concluding that one can freely set @xmath49 .",
    "note that with this convention the values of @xmath50 can be kept unchanged with a suitable redefinition of @xmath32 .",
    "this is one of the most standard approaches used in the literature when @xmath7 does not change  @xcite . as we will see",
    ", one has to proceed with more caution when the coin operator evolves  @xcite .",
    "after the third iteration , the state of the system is @xmath51|+\\rangle \\nonumber\\\\ & + & e^{i(\\alpha_1+\\alpha_2+\\beta_3)}\\sin\\theta_3\\cos\\theta_2\\ , a |-\\rangle \\big\\}\\otimes| { 1}\\rangle \\nonumber\\\\ & -&\\big\\{e^{i(\\beta_1-\\alpha_2-\\beta_3)}\\sin \\theta_3\\cos\\theta_2\\,b|+\\rangle \\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\big[e^{i(\\alpha_1+\\beta_2-\\alpha_3)}\\cos\\theta_3\\sin\\theta_2\\,a\\nonumber\\\\ & -&e^{i(\\beta_1-\\beta_2+\\beta_3)}\\sin\\theta_3\\sin\\theta_2 \\,b\\big]|-\\rangle \\big\\}\\otimes| { -1}\\rangle\\nonumber\\\\ & + & e^{i(\\beta_1-\\alpha_2-\\alpha_3)}\\cos\\theta_3\\cos\\theta_2 \\,b |-\\rangle\\otimes | { -3}\\rangle ,   \\label{psi_three}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , as before , every introduced magnitude appears in some point of the expression .",
    "we have to check @xmath23 and @xmath52 in order to decide which of them are really relevant to the problem : @xmath53 and @xmath54\\nonumber\\\\ & \\pm&\\sin 2\\theta_3\\sin^2\\theta_2\\ , c,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath55 , \\label{c_def}\\ ] ] an interference term .",
    "note that @xmath56 depends on @xmath57 and @xmath58 , but also on @xmath45 , which has reappeared , and observe how @xmath44 is still missing .",
    "the complexity of the explicit expressions for @xmath30 and the derived magnitudes when @xmath59 is so high that we are not going to reproduce them here .",
    "however , as we will show below , eq .",
    "contains enough clues to understanding the main features of the process .",
    "a first conclusion that one can obtain from the previous section is that @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are significant magnitudes .",
    "the importance of a time - dependent @xmath17 in the evolution of the quantum walker was beyond any doubt , as this has been the target of many previous studies  @xcite , so we will fix its value constant @xmath60 , and concentrate our attention in the effects in @xmath12 of evolving phases  @xcite .    another outstanding fact , shown by eq .",
    ", is that the roles played by @xmath15 and @xmath16 are not interchangeable , so we are going to consider them separately .",
    "note that in ref .",
    "@xcite the restriction @xmath61 was imposed .",
    "we will discuss some consequences of this constraint later on .",
    "if @xmath15 and @xmath16 can be chosen independently , further simplification can be obtained by dropping @xmath32 .",
    "this parameter appears in all the previous expressions only through @xmath62 , cf .",
    "eq .  , so we can set @xmath63 hereafter , without any loss of generality as long as we do not set @xmath64 .    the fact that @xmath15 and @xmath16 affect the evolution of the quantum walker in a distinctive way does not imply , however , that we can not obtain similar results with both of them . for instance",
    ", a source of randomness in any of the two phases will distort the coherence of the evolution of the walker  @xcite , which shifts from a ballistic movement to a diffusive spreading  @xcite .",
    "we show this in fig .",
    "[ fig_random ] . in the upper panel",
    "we set @xmath65 and choose @xmath15 at random , whereas the lower one is the outcome of the complementary experiment , we keep @xmath66 and change @xmath16 .",
    "the rest of the parameters were fixed to @xmath67 .",
    "as we can see , in both cases the quantum walk reaches the classical limit , in the classical way : the pmf presents the archetypal hairy aspect , with sharp spikes above and below the gaussian bell  @xcite . as usual",
    ", we have plotted only the non - zero values of pmf , since eq .",
    "implies that if the initial state is located at the origin , cf .",
    "eq .  , at any later time only odd or even sites are occupied with non - zero probabilities .    [ cols=\">,^ \" , ]     we can draw a complementary picture that may help in the understanding the evolution of @xmath12 when @xmath16 follows eq .  , through a geometrical analogy , a representation that is very similar to the bloch sphere  @xcite",
    ". let us introduce @xmath68 , a time - dependent , unit - length vector in @xmath69 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath70 and @xmath16 its polar and azimuthal spherical coordinates , respectively .",
    "then , we can recover the coin operator @xmath12 through the scalar projection of the pauli _ vector _ @xmath71 , with cartesian components @xmath72 onto the @xmath68 direction , i.e. , @xmath73 the evolution of @xmath68 is a step - like precession around the north pole .",
    "observe how , unlike the example shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_sample ] , @xmath74 does not need to be a rational fraction and , therefore , the precession of @xmath68 is not a periodic phenomenon in general .",
    "the absence of periodicity implies that the succession defined by the ending points of the vector @xmath68 constitutes an everywhere - dense subgroup of the corresponding parallel of latitude on the ( bloch ) sphere , and thus the unconditional probability of choosing a particular value for @xmath16 is uniformly distributed in the limit .",
    "this feature is not shared by the second path to invariance , i.e. , @xmath75 as one can easily see , eq .",
    "implies that @xmath15 can take no more than two different values , @xmath76 and @xmath44 , and that these two phases must be chosen alternately .",
    "the formal proof follows the same steps as in the previous case , so we are going to give a simple sketch of it .",
    "we have to assume that the solution to our problem reads @xmath77 and @xmath78 when @xmath18 is even , and @xmath79 and @xmath80 when @xmath18 is odd . the introduction of these expressions in the set of recursive formulas induced by eq .",
    ", @xmath81 and @xmath82 leads to the periodic alternation of @xmath15 between @xmath76 and @xmath44 , which is still arbitrary .",
    "even so , this case is not as rich as the previous one .",
    "finally , note that we have not ruled out the possibility that this kind of nontrivial invariance can be generated by means of recursive laws where @xmath15 and @xmath16 collaborate together .",
    "however , we can show that the phase locking @xmath61 is not a valid candidate .",
    "the key point for this effect is that value of the phase factors at time @xmath83 can be set with independence of the phase factors at time @xmath84 .",
    "this implies , in particular , that condition @xmath85 must be identically satisfied for any choice of @xmath45 . when @xmath61 , the expression for @xmath56 reads , cf .",
    ".  , @xmath86,\\ ] ] and then @xmath45 is tied to @xmath87 .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed some properties of a discrete - time quantum walk on the line when the coin operator depends on the time variable .",
    "in particular , we have focused our interest on the effects that the time dependence of the two phase factors can cause on the behavior of the walker . in the first place ,",
    "we have shown how random changes in any of these magnitudes lead to the recovery of the classical limit .",
    "but decoherence is not the immediate consequence of temporal inhomogeneity in the process . on the contrary",
    ", we have found a way to mimic the motion of any ordinary quantum walk by means of a sequence of well - chosen , time - dependent coin operators .",
    "a remarkable property of this invariance is that the way in which the _ replicating _ sequence must be designed is precise but not unique .",
    "it depends on two free parameter whose values can not be assessed through the mere inspection of the position of the walker .    the information that is hidden in these two magnitudes must be recovered by means of specific inspection of the local quantum properties coined walker .",
    "the implications of this fact will be the subject of future research ."
