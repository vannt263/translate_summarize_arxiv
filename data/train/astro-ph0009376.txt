    "young stars , born from dense molecular cloud cores , frequently drive highly supersonic jets and winds which are traced by herbig - haro ( hh ) objects at visual wavelengths , near infrared emission line regions bright in molecular hydrogen and [ feii ] , and the ubiquitous bipolar molecular outflows observable at millimeter wavelengths .",
    "hh objects are collisionally excited nebulae produced by outflows ejected by young stellar objects ( ysos ) and they either trace shocks where outflows ram the ambient cloud ( terminal working surfaces ) or shocks produced by colliding fluid elements ejected from the source at different velocities and times ( internal working surfaces ) . usually , they can be identified by their forbidden [ sii ] emission and large [ sii]/  line ratio . since herbig - haro objects are thought to be produced mainly during the first few hundred thousand years of the life of a yso , most hh sources are highly obscured by the cloud cores and circumstellar environments from which they formed .",
    "the optical emission lines which trace normal hh objects are excited by non - equilibrium processes in and behind shock waves .",
    "therefore , the intensities of the emitted lines depend on the complex details of the flow such as the shock geometry , the structure and strength of magnetic fields , the ionization fraction , and the effects of the radiation generated by the shocks themselves on the upstream and downstream material .",
    "therefore , it is very difficult to reliably estimate the basic physical parameters such as density , temperature , and ionization fraction and how these parameters vary across the emission region .",
    "furthermore , it is even harder to infer the overall parameters that characterize an outflow such as the stellar mass loss rate , outflow momentum , and flow kinetic energy flux , since moving material which remains quiescent ( unshocked ) is not traced by these emission lines at all .",
    "therefore , most of the mass ( and therefore the momentum and kinetic energy ) of an outflow may remain invisible .",
    "reipurth _ et al .",
    "_  ( 1998 ) recently identified four herbig - haro jets located near the luminous high mass multiple star system @xmath2 orionis , all four of which originate from _ visible _ t - tauri stars _ not _ embedded in opaque molecular cloud cores .",
    "the intense ultraviolet radiation field of the massive stars has ionized and removed the bulk of the interstellar matter from the yso environment .",
    "interestingly , all of these jets are asymmetric , with the beam facing away from @xmath2 orionis being much brighter than the counter beam .    the discovery of externally irradiated hh objects such as those found by reipurth _",
    "_  ( 1998 ) and cernicharo _ et al .",
    "_  ( 1998 ) creates new opportunities for diagnosing outflows . in externally irradiated outflow systems , the intensity of the emission produced by a variety of spectral lines may be primarily determined by the external illumination rather than the complex physics of shocks .",
    "for example , if the external radiation field ionizes either the surface or the entire body of a jet or wind , the observed intensity of the   line can be directly related to the emission measure , and the red [ sii ] lines can be used to measure the electron density .",
    "measurements of the radial velocity field and flow morphology can be combined with these parameters to infer many flow properties such as the mass loss rate , momentum carried in each beam , and the energy injected into the cloud by the flow . instead of relying on highly uncertain shock models",
    ", we can apply the well understood theory of photoionized nebulae to estimate outflow parameters .",
    "furthermore , external radiation fields are likely to illuminate _ all _ unshadowed outflow components equally so that the flow structure can be determined reliably .",
    "in this paper we report the discovery of new irradiated jets in two star forming regions ; the orion nebula ( m42 , ngc 1976 ; d = 470 pc ) and the ngc  1333 region in the perseus molecular cloud ( d = 220 pc ) .",
    "we first discuss the observations and present a description of each new flow . then we present a simple photo - ionization model for irradiated jets , discuss a possible mechanism for the production of jet asymmetries , and finally explore the implications of c - shaped symmetry observed in jets contained both within the orion nebula and near the core of ngc  1333 .",
    "we obtained narrow band images of the orion nebula and ngc  1333 on the nights of 28@xmath330 october 1997 at the prime focus of the mayall 4 meter telescope using the mosaic 8192 @xmath4 8192 pixel ccd camera equipped with the engineering grade ccd detectors .",
    "the field of view of this setup is approximately 36  @xmath4 36  with a scale of 0.26  per pixel ( for details , see the mosaic homepage at",
    "_ http://www.noao.edu/kpno/mosaic/mosaic.html_ ) .",
    "to minimize the effects of bad columns and pixels , and the 40 pixel - wide gaps between the individual ccd detectors , we obtained for each field a set of five 600s exposures using a dither pattern with a spacing of 100 pixels .",
    "images were obtained through an   narrow band filter centered on 6563   with a band pass of 75  , and through a [ sii ] filter centered on 6730   with a band pass of 81  .",
    "the data were overscanned , trimmed , dark subtracted , and flat fielded using the iraf package _",
    "mscred_. this package compensates for the geometrical distortions introduced by the 4 meter optics , including the effects of the field flattener .",
    "dark subtraction was based on a median - combined set of eleven 600s dark exposures taken at various times throughout the observing run .",
    "a comparison of darks taken at different times during the run did not show any significant variations .",
    "flat fielding was based on sky flats .",
    "the  flat was formed by median combining nine twilight sky flats , while the [ sii ] flat was formed by median combining thirteen sky flats . after reduction ,",
    "individual images were combined into a single fits image in each filter with iraf .",
    "an internal reflection resulting from a defective anti - reflection coating on the prime - focus field flattener / corrector produced a large doughnut shaped artifact in the images that persists at the few percent level after flat fielding and median combining .",
    "since the amount of reflection depends critically on the location of bright objects in the imaged field , its intensity varies from image to image .",
    "this artifact is less noticeable in regions with strong emission .",
    "visual wavelength spectra were obtained with the rc spectrograph at 30  km  s@xmath5  resolution at the mayall 4  m reflector at kitt peak , on the nights of december 26 through 30 , 1998 .",
    "spectra covering the wavelength range from [ oi ] @xmath66300 to [ sii ] @xmath66731 were obtained with a 2  wide and 5  long slit which was oriented in each flow at the position angle listed in table  1 using grating kpc 24 in second order and a long - pass glass order sorting filter ( og 570 ) . the image scale of this setup was 0.69  per pixel along the slit and 0.54  per pixel ( 24 km",

    "the orion nebula ( figure  1 ) is the nearest region of active high mass star formation .",
    "located at a distance of about 470 pc , the nebula contains the trapezium cluster of o and early b stars and over 700 low mass stars within a region less than a few parsecs in diameter ( e.g. mccaughrean & stauffer 1994 ) .",
    "the most luminous member , @xmath7  orionis  c  ( o6pe ) is responsible for ionizing the hii  region .",
    "the ten parsec long dense filament of molecular gas at the northern end of the orion  a cloud which spawned the orion nebula is associated with at least 2,000 ysos , the majority of which are less than 1 million years old ( hillenbrand 1997 ; hillenbrand & hartmann 1998 ) .",
    "bally , odell , & mccaughrean ( 2000a ) report the discovery of 24 compact irradiated microjets emerging from the ` proplyds ' ( an acronym for proto planetary disk ) in the nebular core .",
    "figures 26 show [ sii ] and  images of the irradiated jets embedded in the outskirts of the orion nebula .",
    "four irradiated jets lie in the southern and western parts of the nebula .",
    "the appearance of these jets is likely to be dominated by the lyman continuum ( lyc or euv ) radiation field of the trapezium stars .",
    "one jet lies towards the northeast well beyond the projected boundary of the nebula where it is likely to be only exposed to softer far ultraviolet ( fuv ) radiation .    *",
    "hh 502 : * this outflow ( figure  2 ) consists of a knotty 60  long jet , extending south towards at least three bow shocks of progressively larger size and lower surface brightness that lie up to 150  from the source .",
    "although the counterjet is more than three times fainter , there are two relatively high surface brightness bow shocks on the north side of this outflow .",
    "overall , the jet and the chain of bow shocks bend away from the orion nebula core .",
    "the outflow originates from a 17-th magnitude  emission line star located 2.8  east and 6.2  south of the trapezium ( @xmath7  orionis  c ) .",
    "the stellar  emission has an equivalent width ( ew ) of about 60  and can be traced to about @xmath8 700 km  s@xmath5  on either side of the nebular  emission , indicating that the source of the hh  502 jet is a classical t tauri star .",
    "strong forbidden [ oi ] emission in the @xmath6 6300 and @xmath6 6363  lines is seen from the star with ew([oi ] ) @xmath9 10  in each line .",
    "this emission is predominantly redshifted by about 30 km  s@xmath5   from the nebular [ oi ] emission .",
    "however , faint [ oi ] line wings can be traced up to @xmath8 75 km  s@xmath5  from the nebular line on top of the stellar continuum .",
    "in addition to this spatially unresolved component , the [ oi ] emission also exhibits a spatially extended redshifted ( @xmath9 50 km  s@xmath5 ) feature which in the spectra can be faintly traced for about 20  south of the source along the direction of the jet visible in the  image ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the main jet from this star extends to the south at pa = 208@xmath10 and is much brighter in   than in [ sii ] ( table 2a , 3 ) .",
    "although the jet fades considerably about 5  south of the source , it can be traced for nearly an arc minute to the south as a series of about seven knots and faint interconnecting emission .",
    "remarkably , the jet remains unresolved in the transverse direction ( width @xmath11 1 ) for up to 40  from the source ! the jet bends to the south by about 5  roughly 25  south of the source .",
    "the position angles of various features in the hh  502 outflow with respect to the central star , and the deflection from the nominal launch direction of the jet are listed in table 2a .",
    "at least three  bow shocks are seen at intervals of about 45  along the jet axis south of the source .",
    "knots of [ sii ] emission are found at the tips of the bows .",
    "two  dominated bows are seen towards the opposite side of the source in the counterflow direction at pa = 40@xmath10 .",
    "the three bow shocks south of the source and the two lying north of the source do not lie in a straight line , but on a curve that indicates c - shaped symmetry about the source .",
    "three rc spectrograph long - slit orientations and placements were used to observe hh  502 . the first slit ( pa = 22  or 202 )",
    "is centered on the source star and passes near the core of the first compact bow shock ( s6 , located 50  from the source ) and the wings of the next bow shock ( s7 , located about 10  downstream ) . except within 5  of the source",
    ", this slit orientation misses most of the curved jet which emerges towards the southwest .",
    "the second slit , ( pa = 40@xmath10 ) is also centered on the source star and was chosen to pass through the apices of the two bow shocks lying to the northeast of the source ( n2 and n3 ) .",
    "this slit included the light of the star superimposed on the northern lobe of hh  502 ( star a ) and star b in figure 1 .",
    "finally , the third slit ( pa = 7@xmath10 ) is centered on a faint star ( star c ) in the southwest lobe of the hh  502 flow and passes through the brightest knots at the apices of the bow shocks s6 and s7 as well as the eastern side of s8 located 30  downstream from s7 .",
    "the results of the spectroscopic observations of hh  502 show that : ( 1 ) the brighter southern jet is redshifted by + 50 km  s@xmath5  with respect to the orion nebula with wings extending to about + 70 km  s@xmath5 .",
    "the jet kinematics is most apparent in the [ nii ] lines since the  line is overwhelmed by the strong background produced by the orion nebula .",
    "however , unlike the  emission , the [ nii ] emission is brighter towards the northern counter jet than towards the main jet that extends south of the source .",
    "faint [ sii ] emission is also visible within several arc seconds of the source on both sides . ( 2 ) the flow from the young star exhibits kinematic asymmetry with the fainter northern lobe being blueshifted by about @xmath3100 km  s@xmath5  with wings extending to about @xmath3130 km  s@xmath5 . the jet and counter jet are more easily seen in [ nii ] than in  due to the better contrast against the nebular background . as the [ nii ]",
    "lines , the [ sii ] emission also shows this kinematic asymmetry .",
    "( 3 ) the blueshifted northern bow shocks n2 and",
    "n3 have doppler shifts of @xmath3130 km  s@xmath5  and @xmath370 km  s@xmath5  respectively .",

    "the source of hh  502 does not exhibit a measurable lithium absorption feature .",
    "thus , all of these stars are likely members of the extended trapezium cluster .",
    "( 6 ) finally , slit 2 reveals a @xmath375 km  s@xmath5  feature , f , visible in  and [ nii ] about 30  southwest of the driving source of hh  502 which is not associated with the hh  502 outflow system .",

    "* the second most prominent irradiated jet in the outskirts of the orion nebula is hh  503 ( figure  3 ) , located 9.8  west and 2.2   south of hh  502 ( 6.9  w , 8.4  s of @xmath7  orionis  c ) . unlike most other irradiated jets in hii  regions , this flow has a relatively large [ sii ] to  brightness ratio and is therefore seen with greater contrast against the background in the [ sii ] image .",
    "the optical bipolar outflow emerges from an  emission line star with strong lithium absorption .",
    "this star also exhibits forbidden [ oi ] emission .",
    "although a bipolar jet is visible on both sides of the star in both  and [ sii ] , it is highly asymmetric in brightness , with the portion of the jet extending to northwest ( pa = 285 ) from the star being at least four times brighter than the counterjet .",
    "the jet can be traced to a compact [ sii ] dominated bow shock , hh  503  w1 , about 65  from the source star .",
    "the wings of this bow shock are highly asymmetric , with the northern side that faces the core of the orion nebula being much brighter and larger than the other side .",
    "the north rim of this bow can be traced for 50  back nearly to the source star .",
    "the southern rim of this shock disappears within a few arc seconds of the tip of the bow .",
    "the extended north wing lies about 5  north and its curvature closely follows the bent body of the jet .",
    "a second and brighter bow shock ( hh  503  w2 ) lies about 18  farther west . unlike hh  503  w1 , this object does not exhibit extended wings and is only about 4 in size .",

    "this structure looks like a fragmenting bow shock that is bright in both [ sii ] and .",
    "overall , hh  503 is a highly collimated jet system with multiple bow shocks whose outflow axis appears to be bent by about 40@xmath10 .",
    "thus , the jet and the associated chain of bow shocks exhibit bending away from the core of the orion nebula ( c - shaped symmetry ) .",

    "the third spectrum , obtained at pa = 120 , includes the brighter bow shocks hh  503 w2 and e2 .",
    "this bent outflow appears to be redshifted towards the northwest and blueshifted towards the southeast based on the kinematics of knots w2 and e1 .",
    "however , neither the jet nor knot w1 were detected in the spectra , presumably because of the faintness of these features .",
    "knot w2 has a redshifted velocity of about + 25 km  s@xmath5  while knot e1 is blueshifted at @xmath325 km  s@xmath5  with faint  line wings extending to about @xmath3100 km  s@xmath5  with respect to the orion nebula .",
    "this wing emission suggests that the shocks in e1 have speeds of at least 50 km  s@xmath5  ( hartigan _ et al . _",
    "although it lies on the nominally blueshifted side of the hh  503 flow , the large and bright double bow shock e2 is redshifted , with a mean doppler shift of about + 25 km  s@xmath5   with faint emission extending up to + 75 km  s@xmath5 .",
    "therefore , it is possible that e2 is not part of the hh  503 system . however , if it is , then the flow must be bent not only in the plane of the sky , but also along the line of sight .",
    "furthermore , the four bright compact bow shocks that delineate the bent body of this bipolar flow can not be moving ballistically from the source .",
    "instead , the emitting material must itself have undergone a large deflection from the initial outflow launch direction both in the plane of the sky and along the line of sight .",
    "the spectra also demonstrate that the three hh objects in this flow ( hh  503 e2 , w1 , and w2 ) are most prominent in the 6300  [ oi ] and in the [ sii ] lines , and barely detected in , indicating that these hh objects have large neutral components .",

    "the time - scale for the evaporation of the residual envelope can be estimated by assuming that this soft uv radiation is absorbed within a layer with a column density of @xmath37 @xmath38 , the penetration depth of this radiation ( cf . hollenbach & tielens 1997 ) . in the approximation that this flow diverges spherically",

    "if the actual gas density at radius @xmath40 is less than @xmath41 , the photon dominated region will advance into the cloud supersonically until a region with a density greater than @xmath41 is encountered .",
    "however , in this higher density environment , the pdr heated front will advance sub - sonically ; outside the transition from shielded to irradiated gas , a roughly steady state outflow is established . in this scenario ,",

    "cloud cores and envelopes can often be represented by power - law radial density profiles of the form @xmath55 .",
    "it can be shown that for mass loss controlled predominantly by the pdr , the cloud radius evolves with time according to @xmath56^{1 / ( 2 - \\alpha)}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 and @xmath58 and @xmath59 is the initial mass of the power - law envelope inside radius @xmath40 . as an example , for a power - law index of @xmath60 , and an initial envelope mass of 1 m@xmath53 inside a radius of 0.1 pc , the envelope is completely destroyed in @xmath61 years for a pdr sound speed of 3 km  s@xmath5 .",

    "for the parameters used above , complete envelope ionization is somewhat slower , taking about @xmath66 years for the uniform density case .",
    "while the dissipating envelopes surrounding young stars in ngc  1333 are expected to remain predominantly neutral , within the orion nebula and its photo - ionized environment , the expanding envelopes will pass though an ionization front to form bright expanding condensations within the body of the hii  region . in the orion nebula proplyds , mass loss",
    "is sustained by the continued photo - evaporation of dense circumstellar disks at mass loss rates of about @xmath67 m@xmath53  yr@xmath5 ( johnstone , hollenbach , & bally 1998 ) . since these disks are much smaller than the cloud cores considered above ( @xmath9100 au vs. 0.1 pc ) , their mass loss rates are correspondingly much lower .",
    "_ the heating , expansion , and removal of lower density material will decrease the extinction and render visible the immediate circumstellar environment , including the young stars , their jets , and winds .",
    "_    dissociation , heating , and photo - evaporation by the soft uv radiation fields of nearby massive o , b , and even early a stars may play a major role in destroying the envelopes from which young stars accrete , thereby bringing further stellar growth to a halt .",
    "since irradiated jets appear to be associated with naked young stars , their presence may signal one method by which nature regulates the final masses of stars , namely the termination of accretion by external photo - evaporation .",
    "furthermore , the photo - evaporative flows may play a fundamental role in the origins of turbulent motions inside molecular clouds ( bally _ et al . _",
    "2000a ) .",
    "the launching of a high velocity wind or jet requires a reservoir of mass in the circumstellar environment to fuel the outflow .",
    "most likely , this reservoir is in the form of a compact high density circumstellar disk surrounding the star .",
    "the sources of the irradiated jets must be in an evolutionary state where they have lost their envelopes ( since the stars suffer low extinction ) but still retain a substantial disk ( since they power an outflow ) .",
    "when such an outflow or jet is irradiated from the outside , the radiation field can dramatically improve the visibility of the moving fluid both in and far from the shock zone .",
    "therefore , as noted by reipurth _",
    "et al . _  ( 1998 ) , herbig - haro flows embedded within hii  regions provide a unique opportunity to determine completely the physical parameters of an outflow . ionizing radiation in such an environment can partially or fully ionize all or most outflow components .",
    "in this situation , shock waves are _ not _ required to render the gas visible .",
    "et al . _  ( 2000 ) present a more complete discussion of the propagation of ionization fronts into externally irradiated cylindrical jets .",
    "even when lyman continuum radiation is not present , the softer uv radiation can enhance the visibility of the outflow .",
    "photo - electric heating resulting from the interaction of the soft uv radiation field with grains in the medium produce extended regions that are bright in the optical forbidden lines such as [ sii ] .",
    "assume that the jet is launched with a steady ejection velocity , @xmath68 and prior to being irradiated can be characterized by a constant sound speed along its length , @xmath69 .",
    "these assumptions imply that the jet , if permitted by the ambient medium , will spread orthogonal to its direction of propagation at the mach angle , @xmath70 so that the radius of the jet , @xmath71 , as a function of distance from the source , @xmath21 , increases as @xmath72 .",
    "if the mass loss rate into this lobe of the jet is given by @xmath73 , the mean density along the jet decreases as    @xmath74    now consider a source of lyman continuum radiation illuminating this jet so that the angle between the jet outflow axis and the direction to the illuminating star is given by an angle @xmath75 .",
    "if the jet points away from the ionizing source , it will initially be shadowed by the circumstellar disk .",
    "once the jet emerges from this shadow the incident flux of lyman continuum radiation is given by    @xmath76    where @xmath77 is the total opacity of the medium between the source of lyman continuum radiation which is assumed to be at a distance @xmath78 from the portion of the jet under consideration .",
    "under most conditions , an r - type front will propagate rapidly into the side of the jet facing the illuminating star .",
    "however , raga _",
    "et al._(2000 ) show that under some conditions the front can also start out as a d - type front .",
    "if the jet has a sufficiently low density , it will become fully ionized by the incident radiation field . on the other hand , for",
    "a sufficiently high density jet , recombinations in the photo - ionized layer will slow the advance of the r - type front , eventually converting it into a d - type front .",
    "however , the gradual divergence of the jet guarantees that even in this latter case , as the distance from the jet source increases , an ever increasing portion of the jet will become ionized until the whole jet is fully ionized . in either case",
    "the degree of penetration of the ionizing radiation depends on the azimuthal angle about the jet axis .",
    "penetration is greatest on the side of the jet facing the ionizing source , and least on the side facing away from the source .",
    "back - side ionization is produced by the diffuse radiation field present in the hii  region and is therefore sensitive to the detailed spatial and density structure of the hii  region .",
    "ionization will raise the plasma temperature of the jet to about 6,000 to 10,000 k for normal ( solar ) abundances . because the sound speed in the neutral shielded portion of the jet is likely to be less than the sound speed in the ionized plasma , photo - ionization will likely increase the divergence ( mach ) angle of the jet . in the ionized region , the transverse expansion orthogonal to the jet axis will occur at about a velocity of @xmath25 , the sound speed in the photo - ionized medium .",
    "the incident lyman continuum radiation is completely consumed by recombining ions and electrons in a layer of plasma with a thickness @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the electron density at the ionization front .",
    "if at the point where the jet emerges into the irradiated zone , @xmath81 , then the jet is in the low density limit and it will become fully ionized as the r - type front races through the thickness of the jet . if @xmath82 , the jet is in the high density limit and full ionization will be regulated by the divergence of the jet at the mach angle .    for a dense jet , setting @xmath83 leads to a an estimate of the maximum distance from the source of the jet at which a neutral core can exist , @xmath84 . beyond this distance",
    ", the jet will be fully ionized . therefore ,    @xmath85 this assumes that the radiation field is symmetric about the jet axis and that the core is ionized at the same rate in all directions . in general",

    "highly asymmetric ionization can increase @xmath84 by about a factor of 2 . for symmetric illumination ,",

    "this corresponds to about 4000 au or 0.02 pc , which is short compared to most hh jets .",
    "most herbig - haro flows are episodic .",
    "the shock waves associated with internal working surfaces , formed where faster ejecta overtake slower moving material , make portions of the jet visible .",
    "the four irradiated jets investigated by reipurth _",
    "et al . _  ( 1998 ) in the @xmath2 orionis region exhibit relatively strong [ oi ] and [ sii ] emission ( compared to ) close to the source where the jet is either shielded from external ultraviolet radiation or still retains a neutral core .",
    "this forbidden line emission originates in compact knots which likely trace internal working surfaces within the body of the jet . the brightest @xmath2 orionis jet , hh  444 , is associated with several nested bow shocks located more than 1 arc minute from the source .",
    "these features provide evidence that irradiated jets are also likely to be powered by time variable mass loss .",
    "the episodic mass loss produces jets with density variations along their lengths .",
    "furthermore , internal working surfaces and complex shock structures will form where faster ejecta overtakes slower ejecta supersonically .",
    "internal working surfaces can produce line emission in the shielded portion of the jet .",
    "when low excitation shocks dominate excitation , the resulting emission will be dominated by the forbidden emission lines of neutral and low ionization states of common species like [ oi ] , [ sii ] , and [ nii ] .",
    "as such a jet emerges into the external radiation field , the outer layer of the outflow will become ionized and the interior will be heated by the fuv radiation field .",
    "thus , the jet skin will develop an hii  region spectrum while the shielded jet interior will exhibit enhanced forbidden line emission due to the heating by the fuv radiation .",
    "however , divergence of the flow insures that eventually , the entire jet becomes photoionized and will therefore produce an hii  region spectrum .",
    "internal working surfaces within the jet will alter the density distribution .",
    "high density regions may be self - shielded and may retain mostly neutral cores for a much longer time than the lower density regions .",
    "thus , episodic behavior and variations in the jet ejection velocity will generate clumps and complex structure in the irradiated portion of the jet .",
    "however , external ionization of these structures will render all moving fluid elements visible on deep images .",
    "the four irradiated jets discovered by reipurth _",
    "et al . _  ( 1998 ) in the @xmath2 orionis sub - group of the orion ob association are predominantly one sided .",
    "the brightest portions of these outflows point _",
    "away _ from the hot star . preliminary spectroscopic evidence ( cf .",
    "bally _ et al . _",
    "2000b ) indicates that for the jets near @xmath2 ori , the brighter jet beams often have lower speeds than fainter counter jets .",
    "therefore , the apparent asymmetry in jet intensity may be a consequence of an underlying _ kinematic asymmetry _",
    ", possibly produced by the radiation field . the radiation field may preferentially decrease the density of matter on the irradiated side of a disk more than on the shadowed side . as an otherwise symmetric jet ( both beams have the same mass loss rates and speeds )",
    "propagates through such an asymmetric medium , it may suffer more mass loading on the denser shadowed side than on the less dense irradiated side .",
    "this is especially true if mass loading primarily effects the skin of the jet , as it is the skin that is first ionized .",
    "such mass loading could decelerate the jet motion through the shadowed side more than on the irradiated side .",
    "bally _ et al .",
    "_  ( 2000a ) discuss over 20 irradiated microjets embedded within the core of the orion nebula which were discovered on deep high resolution hubble space telescope images .",
    "the majority of these jets are also asymmetric with a slight tendency for the brighter beam to face the dominant source of the uv radiation .",
    "et al . _  ( 1997 ) found that many microjets produced by t - tauri stars appear to be one sided ; some show a kinematic asymmetry with one beam having a larger velocity .",
    "all five outflows reported here in the outskirts of the orion nebula , hh  502  506 , are also asymmetric . although both hh  502 and 503 contain bow shocks on either side of the source , indicating that mass loss is bipolar , the jets in both of these sources are more prominent on the side of the source facing away from the source of lyman continuum radiation .",
    "though jets are visible on the opposite side of the source that faces into the radiation field , they tend to be much fainter and shorter .    as discussed by reipurth _",
    "et al . _  ( 1998 ) , extinction can be ruled out as an explanation for the asymmetry of the @xmath2 orionis jets .",
    "similar arguments can be used to rule out extinction as the explanation for the asymmetries of the jets located in the orion nebula .",
    "the nebular background is sufficiently bright so that any extended absorbing cloud would be seen in silhouette .",
    "furthermore , in the two jets where bow shocks are seen on both sides of the central source , these shocks have similar surface brightness , indicating that there is little difference in extinction on the two sides of the source .",
    "the preliminary evidence suggests that the orion jets exposed to lyman continuum radiation are often one sided . on the other hand ,",
    "the irradiated jets in ngc  1333 , which are exposed to weaker and softer uv radiation fields , tend to exhibit bipolar symmetry .      in this section ,",
    "two models of bipolar jets which can produce the observed asymmetries in irradiated jets are discussed .",
    "it is assumed that the jet is intrinsically bipolar with the same mass loss rate , @xmath73 , into each beam .",
    "however , the velocity with which each beam moves away from the source , @xmath68 , is assumed to be different for each beam . as discussed above",
    ", different amounts of mass loading in each beam may produce such kinematic asymmetry .    in the first model , case a",
    ", the opening angles of the lobes of the bipolar jet are assumed to be the same .",
    "lobes of a bipolar jet may expand into cones having the same opening angle if jet spreading is dominated by _",

    "asymmetric bipolar jets with a _ constant beam opening angle _ the _ slower _ beam is brighter . in the second model ,",
    "case b , the speed at which jet material spreads orthogonal to its bulk motion is assumed to be constant .",
    "therefore , the opening angle of the jet is inversely proportional to the jet speed .",
    "this situation is likely to prevail if the transverse expansion of the jet is determined by _",
    "internal processes _ such as heating by a radiation field so that each beam expands at the sound speed into a mach cone . alternatively ,",
    "if the amplitudes of the velocity variations producing internal shocks are the same in each beam , splashing of jet material orthogonal to the jet axis may occur at a fixed velocity . in kinematically asymmetric bipolar jets with",
    "a _ constant transverse spreading _ ,",
    "faster _ beam is brighter .",
    "other , more complex models , which will not be discussed here in detail , are also possible .",
    "for example , if the kinematic asymmetry is generated at the source rather than by mass loading , the faster outflow lobe might also have time - variability with a larger velocity amplitude .",
    "this would produce stronger shocks , and denser shocked material , which would result in a brighter jet beam .",
    "_ case a : bipolar jets with a constant opening angle _    consider a bipolar jet in which both lobes have the _ same _ opening angle , @xmath93 .",
    "furthermore , assume that the mass loss rates into each beam are identical , and that the beams have different velocities .",
    "therefore , at a given distance from the source @xmath21 , the jet radii , @xmath94 will be the same .",
    "however , the continuity equation implies that if the mass loss rates , @xmath73 , into each beam are the same , the density of matter in the jet , @xmath95 , will be higher in the slower beam than the corresponding density at the same distance from the source in the faster beam .",
    "the surface brightness of an emission line scales as the emission measure , @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the path length of the observer s line - of - sight through the emission region .",

    "the  surface brightness can be used to estimate the emission measure , em , of a jet from the relationship @xmath104 @xmath105 where @xmath106 is in units of @xmath107 ( spitzer 1978 ) .",
    "if the extent of the jet along the line - of - sight is assumed to be the same as the projected width of a feature , the emission measure can be used to estimate the electron density of the plasma within the jet from the relation @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the path length through the emission feature .",
    "these quantities are tabulated in table  3 along with the surface brightness of the [ sii ] emission from the same features and the  to [ sii ] surface brightness ratio for a selected set of points in the major detected features of each flow .",
    "the listed values correspond to the peak surface brightness in each region , and therefore yield upper bounds on the line intensities and derived electron densities .",
    "if the jet is fully ionized by the external radiation field the derived plasma density _ is _ the jet density , which can be combined with measurements of the jet velocity to estimate the mass loss rates into each beam , the momentum , and energy fluxes .",
    "the flow momentum and energy can be estimated from the density , the flow cross - section , and the fluid velocity . for a cylindrical flow with radius @xmath71 , density @xmath110 , and velocity @xmath68 ,",
    "the mass loss rate in the jet , or equivalently the rate at which mass flows through a given stationary surface , is given by @xmath111 . in terms of this quantity ,",
    "the flux of momentum and kinetic energy are @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "thus , for a jet speed of @xmath114 in units of 100 km  s@xmath5 , a jet density @xmath115 in units of @xmath31 @xmath116 , and a jet radius @xmath117 in units of 115 au ( which corresponds to our seeing deconvolved resolution limit in orion ) , the jet has a mass loss rate @xmath118 m@xmath119 , a momentum transfer rate of @xmath120 m@xmath121 , and a mechanical luminosity of @xmath122 l@xmath53 .",
    "table 4 summarizes the mechanical parameters of the photo - ionized portions of the flows in the orion nebula .",
    "the extent to which the jet is ionized can be estimated by comparing the observed emission measure to that of a self - shielded cylinder of neutral gas .",
    "if the jet contains a shielded neutral core with a radius @xmath123 , and is located at a distance @xmath78 from a source of lyman continuum radiation with luminosity @xmath20 , then photo - ionization equilibrium in the shielding layer implies that @xmath124 where @xmath125 is a factor of order unity which takes into account the relative orientation of the jet , the line of sight to the illuminating star , and the geometric divergence of the expanding plasma .",
    "thus , the emission measure is given by @xmath126 where @xmath127 photons per second is the lyman continuum luminosity of the trapezium , and @xmath128 is in parsecs .",
    "the inner portion of the hh 502 and 503 jets and some of the brighter knots in the hh  502 bow shocks are only a factor of 4  10 lower than this maximal emission measure .",
    "thus , these portions of the flow are likely to be only partially ionized with a shielding layer that protects a neutral core from the lyman continuum radiation .",
    "thus , the mass loss estimates and other parameters listed in table 5 may well be lower limits .",
    "on the other hand , finite angular resolution may result in an overestimate of the jet mass loss rate .",
    "near their sources , the orion nebula jets are essentially unresolved in width .",
    "thus , the jet width used in the estimation of mass loss rates is _ assumed _ to be at the seeing - deconvolved resolution limit of about 0.5 , corresponding to a jet radius of 115 au . if the jet radius is actually _ smaller _ , the estimated electron density in the ionized region _ increases _ as @xmath129 , and the resulting jet mass loss rate _ declines _ as @xmath130 .",
    "thus , higher angular resolution measurements of both the jet ionization structure and its width , and a combination of proper motion measurements and more precise radial velocity determinations are needed to better constrain the jet parameters and to take full advantage of the ionized nature of these outflows .",
    "hh  502 in orion ( figure 2 ) and hh  333 in perseus ( figure 8) are the longest jets discussed here . and they are both extremely collimated .",
    "the beams of these jets remain less than two arc seconds in diameter at distances larger than 40  ( for hh  502 ) and 120  ( for hh  333 ) from their respective sources .",
    "thus , these jets remain collimated to within a few degrees or less . such a high degree of collimation is even more surprising in the light of the low radial velocities measured for these jets .    in an externally photo - ionized jet such as hh  502 or hh  503",
    ", the sound speed in the jet interior should be about 10 km  s@xmath5 .",
    "if the intrinsic jet speed is assumed to be 100 km  s@xmath5 , then the mach angle is predicted to be about 6 , and the jet opening angle should be about 12 , many times larger than the apparent opening angles of hh  502 or hh  503 .",
    "there are three possible reasons why these jets may appear so collimated .",
    "first , these jets may lie nearly in the plane of the sky , in which case their true velocities may be many times the observed radial velocity . however , to produce a less than 3  opening angle , the speed of the hh  502 or hh  503 jets would have to exceed 300 km  s@xmath5 .",
    "second , it is possible that the jet is so dense that only a thin surface layer becomes ionized throughout its visible length .",
    "thus , the jet density estimates based on the emission measure may be strict lower limits . in this scenario ,",
    "the jet interior may remain sufficiently shielded and cold so that the mach angle remains very small and the jet does not spread .",
    "however , to explain the fading or disappearance of the beam , the beam must come to an end at some distance from the source .",
    "a time - variable outflow would produce segments of ejecta separated by relatively empty gaps .",
    "perhaps the apparent ends of these jets correspond to the beginning of the gaps produced by lower mass loss rates in the past .",
    "the bow shocks seen downstream of the apparent ends of jets such as hh  333 and hh  502 may trace the debris piled up by earlier high mass loss rate episodes that were followed by relative inactivity .",
    "this explanation is most likely to apply to the highly collimated irradiated jets in the orion nebula .",
    "third , there may be an invisible confining medium that prevents free expansion .",
    "such a medium may consist of a dense but invisible gas , or a magnetic field .",
    "however , a dense confining medium in the orion nebula s interior would be ionized and visible .",
    "so if confinement is invoked for orion s irradiated jets , then a magnetic field of sufficient strength must be present .",
    "however , in ngc  1333 , a dense medium could remain invisible .",
    "but , its total dust content must not be sufficient to hide the jet .",
    "additional observations are needed to decide which model is the best explanation for the high degree of collimation of the irradiated jets .",
    "two distinct types of c - shape symmetry are observed in orion and ngc  1333 .",
    "all of the bent jets embedded within the orion nebula bend _",
    "away _ from the nebular core . on the other hand , the bent jets in the core of ngc  1333 tend to bend _ toward _ the cluster core .",
    "there are three forces which can in principle deflect a jet propagating through the ionized interior of the orion nebula ; ram pressure of the champagne flow of plasma from the nebular interior ( @xmath131 ) , radiation pressure ( @xmath132 ) , and the rocket effect of the jet shielding layer pushing on the jet neutral core ( @xmath133 ) .",
    "evidence for a general , widespread outflow from the core of the orion nebula has been provided by high dispersion spectroscopy ( odell 1994 ; wen & odell 1993 ; odell _ et al . _  1993 ) and by the presence of stationary bow shocks formed where t tauri star winds impact this outflow ( bally _ et al . _",
    "though highly uncertain , the mass flux from the orion nebula core has been estimated to be in the range @xmath87 = @xmath134 to @xmath135 m@xmath53  yr@xmath5 with a speed of order 20 km  s@xmath5 .",
    "bally _ et al .",
    "_  ( 2000a ) interpreted the so - called ll orionis wind - wind collision fronts in terms of a collision between wide - angle t tauri stellar winds and the champagne flow from the nebula .",
    "table 5 lists additional wind - wind collision fronts located in the vicinity of the irradiated jets which provide evidence for such a bulk outflow of plasma from the nebula .",
    "although stellar winds from the hot trapezium stars could also play a role , the @xmath136 product of the champagne flow is likely to exceed that of the massive star winds by more than an order of magnitude in the outer nebula .",
    "the effect of the champagne flow ram pressure is identical to the case of a jet propagating in a cross wind ( cf .",
    "et al . _",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the champagne flow ram pressure can be estimated from the mean density of the nebula near the bent jets , and its average flow velocity of slightly more than the sound speed in ionized gas .",
    "thus , @xmath137 @xmath138 dynes @xmath38 where @xmath139 is the plasma density in units of @xmath140 and @xmath29 is a factor of order unity .",
    "radiation pressure is given by @xmath141 @xmath142 dynes @xmath38 where @xmath143 is the luminosity in units of @xmath144 l@xmath53 , @xmath145 is the opacity of the medium to incident radiation ( most likely much less than 1 ) , and @xmath146 is the distance from the light source in parsecs . finally , for jets above the critical density , an ionized layer forms on the illuminated side of the jet .",
    "its expansion pushes on the neutral jet core , deflecting it away from the light source by means of the rocket effect .",
    "the resulting pressure is given by @xmath147 @xmath148 where @xmath110 is the observed plasma density in the ionized portion of the jet ( cf .",
    "table 3 ) .",
    "typically , the jet surface layer is much more than an order of magnitude denser than the hii  region density in the vicinity of the jet .",
    "if this were not the case , the jet would not be visible against the background nebula since the path length through the jet is usually smaller than the path length through the nebula by more than three orders of magnitude .",
    "once the jet becomes fully ionized ( due to spreading at the internal mach angle ) , the rocket effect disappears since the fully ionized jet plasma will expand symmetrically about its axis .",
    "the rocket effect is most effective in bending the jet when about half of the beam is ionized and the amount of bending expected is roughly @xmath149 which is just the mach angle for a fully ionized jet . for the parameters appropriate for hh  502 to 505 , @xmath150 .",
    "and the rocket effect is likely to dominate other external forces which can act directly on the jet beam .",
    "however , it is possible that deflection of the jet cocoon also plays a role in bending these outflows away from the nebular core .",
    "the densest parts of these cocoons are traced by the various bow shocks associated with the orion nebula irradiated jets .",
    "however , these features are likely to be fully ionized and optically thin to incident radiation .",
    "therefore , the only force capable of deflecting them is the ram pressure of the expanding nebula .",
    "although capable of deflecting the cocoon walls downstream , the cocoon interior is shielded from this force .",
    "such deflection of the cocoon may be responsible for making the upstream side of the hh  503 w1 bow shock be so close to the hh  503 jet .",
    "it also may be responsible for the ll orionis type bow shock surrounding hh  505 .",
    "however , if this was the only force acting on the system , the jet should propagate from the source without deflection until it impacts the deflected cocoon wall .",
    "but , our images of hh  502 and 503 show that the jets themselves are deflected .",
    "if the cocoon interior were sufficiently magnetized , it is possible that alfvn waves in the cocoon interior could transmit the pressure applied on the cocoon walls to the jet , causing it to bend .",
    "however , it is more likely that the above mentioned rocket effect deflects the jet while the ram pressure of the champagne flow deflects the jet cocoon and the associated bow shocks .",
    "the observed deflection angles of both the jets and the jet cavity walls can be used to confront these theoretical ideas . as shown in table 2a ,",
    "the observed jet bending angles are of order 10",
    ".    the true bending angle @xmath75 of a jet may be quite different from the observed bending angle due to the projection of the outflow onto the plane of the sky .",
    "consider a bent outflow from a source assumed to lie at the origin of a cartesian coordinate system .",
    "assume that one beam of the outflow propagates in the @xmath151 direction .",
    "this jet and its counterjet define a plane in which the jet bending angle can be defined as the angle @xmath75 between a vector directed along the @xmath152 axis ( along the expected direction of the counterjet in the absence of bending ) and the counter - jet .",
    "the y - axis of the coordinate system is assumed to lie in the plane of the curved jet .",
    "the projection of the outflow onto the plane of the sky is described by two rotation angles , @xmath153 and @xmath154 , about the @xmath152 and @xmath155 axes , respectively .",
    "( in general , an additional rotation about the line - of - sight is also needed to align the jet or counter - jet with a specific orientation on the sky , but this rotation does not effect the projected jet deflection angle . ) in terms of these two angles , the observed ( projected ) deflection angle , @xmath156 is given by @xmath157\\ ] ]    for example , if @xmath153 = 30  and @xmath154 = 60the true bending angle is nearly a factor of two smaller than the observed ( projected ) bending angle . however , the inclination angles are unknown for the jets discussed here .",
    "cant & raga ( 1995 ) discuss the deflection of a jet by a supersonic side wind . in this model ,",
    "the ambient medium interacts directly with the jet rather than a surrounding cocoon formed by sideways splashing of material colliding in internal working surfaces .",
    "the jet deflection angle , @xmath13 , is defined as the angle between the launch orientation and a line tangent to the jet at some point . for an isothermal jet with sound speed @xmath69",

    "@xmath13 = 2 @xmath164 so that for typical inclination angles , the observed deflection angles ( table 5 ) can be directly used in the above formula . for @xmath165",
    "km  s@xmath5 , @xmath166 , @xmath167 = 1/30 , @xmath168 since the orion jets are visible against the nebular background , they must be much denser than the surrounding medium . for @xmath169  @xmath15 ( table 3 ) and @xmath170  @xmath15 ( a reasonable guess for the outskirts of the orion nebula ) , @xmath171 km  s@xmath5 .",
    "this velocity is about what is expected for either deflection of the jet by the rocket effect , or by the ram pressure of nebular champagne flow .",
    "if the ambient medium is interacting with the jet cocoon rather than the jet itself ( as may be the case for hh  502 and 503 ) , the density @xmath172 above should be that of the cocoon , which may be comparable to the ambient medium . in this case a considerably lower velocity side wind can deflect the flow .",
    "thus , _ the c - shaped symmetry of the orion nebula irradiated jets may be produced by the combined action of the rocket effect acting on the ionized skins of the jets , and the ram pressure of the nebular champagne flow acting on the outer walls of the cavities created by the jets ( the jet cocoons ) .",
    "_      there are two important differences between the jets embedded within ngc  1333 and those in the orion nebula .",
    "first , all bent jets in the orion nebula appear to _ lie at large projected distances from the cluster core_. most lie several parsecs from the trapezium cluster , well beyond its dynamical influence . at this distance ,",
    "the time scales for crossing the cluster at the expected stellar velocities are much longer than the ages of the observed hh flow components .",
    "in contrast , all of the bent jets in the ngc  1333 region _",
    "lie within the projected boundaries of the embedded cluster_. second , the bent jets within the orion nebula are exposed to outward oriented forces such as the rocket effect and the low mach number outflow of plasma from the nebula core .",
    "in contrast , _ there is no rocket effect or outflow of plasma from the ngc  1333 core since there is no h  ii region_. the jets in ngc  1333 are only irradiated by non - ionizing soft - uv photons .",
    "this difference eliminates the bending mechanisms proposed for the irradiated jets in the orion nebula .",
    "furthermore , it makes it conceivable that the bent jets in ngc  1333 result from recent dynamical interactions in the rich cluster of 150 stars packed into a region smaller than 1 pc in diameter .",
    "c - shaped outflows can be produced when either the medium moves past the source of a bipolar jet , or the source moves through the medium . in the orion nebula",
    ", the former explanation plus the outward push of the rocket effect on the jet skin can explain the jet bending .",
    "however , the bipolar flows hh 334 , hh  499 , and hh  498 near ngc  1333 bend _ towards _ the core of the star cluster . for intrinsic bending angles comparable to the observed values ,",
    "hh  334 requires a transverse velocity of about @xmath173 km  s@xmath5 .",
    "however , hh  499 and hh  498 require transverse motions of @xmath174 km  s@xmath5  and @xmath175 km  s@xmath5 , respectively .",
    "it is likely that hh  498 and 499 are seen nearly end - on so that projection effects greatly exaggerate the bending angle .",
    "even so , these velocities are likely to exceed the gravitational escape speed from the parent cloud ( a few km  s@xmath5 ) and can not be produced by infalling gas .",
    "an alternative and more plausible scenario is that these three jet sources have been recently expelled from the cluster center by dynamical interactions such as the re - arrangement of non - hierarchal triple systems ( cf . sterzik & durisen 1995 ; reipurth _ et al . _  1999 and references therein )",
    "for a 10 km  s@xmath5  stellar motion through the medium , the time since ejection from an interaction 0.3 parsec away ( about the distance from the cluster core ) is about 30,000 years . for an ensemble of 150 stars , three such interactions over the 30,000 years",

    "<S> we present a model for the photo - ionization of these outflows by external radiation fields and discuss possible mechanisms for producing the observed asymmetries . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we demonstrate that the uv radiation field may alter the amount of cloud material entrained by the jet . </S>",
    "<S> radiation induced variations in mass loading and beam heating can produce differences in the beam velocities and spreading rates , which in turn determine the surface brightness of the radiating plasma . in a bipolar irradiated jet in which both beams have the same mass loss rate and opening angle , the _ slower </S>",

    "<S> thus , depending on the parameters , either the faster or slower beam of a jet can be brighter . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we report the discovery of some large scale bow shocks which face the core of the orion nebula and which surround visible young stars . </S>",
    "<S> these wind - wind collision fronts provide further evidence for a large scale mass flow originating near the nebular core . </S>"
