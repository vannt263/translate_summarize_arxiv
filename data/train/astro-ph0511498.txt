    "the study of star formation and the associated production and enrichment of the interstellar medium ( ism ) and intergalactic medium ( igm ) by metals is focused on two observational approaches : large galaxy surveys based on rest - frame uv , optical , near - infrared and far - infrared emission , and the use of high redshift quasars as probes of the ism / igm .",
    "the former provides a view of the star formation activity from high redshift to the present , as well as the possible enrichment of the igm through galactic - scale winds . in the context of quasar absorption studies",
    "the highest column density absorbers , the so - called damped lyman alpha ( dla ) systems ( @xmath18 @xmath19 ) are of particular interest .",
    "this is because of the similarity of their column densities to those in local luminous galaxies , the fact that at these columns the hydrogen is mainly neutral and may form stars , and the conclusion that the bulk of the neutral gas in the range @xmath20 is in dlas ( for a recent review see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the connection between luminous star - forming galaxies and dlas remains an open question .",
    "this is primarily due to observational limitations inherent in both approaches .",
    "first , surveys of star - forming galaxies at @xmath21 are limited to relatively bright object , @xmath22 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , with the exception of the brightest galaxies , the continuum emission is typically too faint to observe absorption from interstellar gas and therefore to tie together the star formation and ism properties . on the other hand ,",
    "the use of quasar sight lines to probe the disks of high redshift galaxies is limited by a cross - section selection effect to large impact parameters ( @xmath23 kpc ) . moreover , in the case of dlas the small impact parameters severely limit the identification of the dla counterparts against the bright background quasar .",
    "thus , while some dla counterparts have been identified , primarily at @xmath24 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , a definitive association with star - forming systems or lbgs remains elusive .    despite the observational challenges ,",
    "the various galaxy surveys have provided evidence for near solar metallicities in at least some of the bright high redshift galaxies @xcite .",
    "typical star formation rates in the bright galaxies are in the range of @xmath25 m@xmath11 yr@xmath9 @xcite . on the other hand , dlas appear to be metal poor , with a typical @xmath26 @xmath4 @xcite , and while they exhibit evidence for star formation in a few cases , the rates typically appear to be lower than in the lbgs @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach to probing intervening gas in galaxies and the igm is to use the afterglows of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) . in the context of the relation to star",
    "formation and the nature of dlas , grbs offer several advantages over quasar studies .",
    "first , grbs are embedded in star forming galaxies with typical offsets of a few kpc or less @xcite .",
    "they therefore not only provide a direct link to star formation , but also probe the regions of most intense star formation , and hence production and dispersal of metals .",
    "second , since the grb afterglow emission fades away on a timescale of days to weeks , the host galaxy and any intervening dlas can be subsequently studied directly ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "third , and perhaps most important , since grbs are likely to be located in star forming regions ( e.g. , molecular clouds ) within their host galaxies , this approach provides the only systematic way to directly probe the small - scale environment and conditions of star formation at high redshift ; the probability of intersecting an individual molecular cloud in a quasar sight line is vanishingly small . in the same vein , grbs can probe the circumstellar environment of the progenitor star itself and provide a unique view of the mass loss history and properties of the progenitor ( e.g. , metallicity , mass , binarity ) . with a large statistical sample , this is the only way to compare the properties of massive stars and individual star forming regions at high redshift to those in the milky way and the local universe .    over the past several years , a few absorption spectra of grb afterglows have been obtained , revealing relatively large neutral hydrogen column densities ( most in the dla category ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the metallicity , inferred in only a few cases , appears to be sub - solar ( @xmath27 @xmath4 ; @xcite ) , but with a dust - to - gas ratio that is larger than that in qso - dlas @xcite .",
    "in addition , some spectra reveal complex velocity structure , interpreted to arise from ordered galactic rotation @xcite , and in one case appearing to arise in the complex wind environment of the progenitor star ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these results already suggest that grbs probe environments that are likely missed in the quasar surveys .    with the advent of the  satellite , we can now start to utilize grbs as probes of the high redshift universe in a systematic manner .",
    "s sensitivity and ability to rapidly and accurately localize a large number of grbs has resulted in a redshift distribution spanning nearly uniformly from @xmath28 to @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "this sample is therefore well - matched to the star formation history of the universe , and over time will allow us to address the redshift evolution of star forming environments and perhaps individual massive stars .",
    "along these lines , we present here an absorption spectrum of , which reveals a dla with a column density @xmath30 at a redshift of @xmath0 .",
    "this system is currently the highest redshift grb host for which detailed information is available .",
    "the spectrum probes not only the interstellar medium of the host galaxy , but also provides information on the local environment of the burst , likely including the wind of the progenitor star from which we are able to draw conclusions about the nature of the star that exploded .",
    "was detected by  on 2005 may 5.974 ut .",
    "the duration and fluence of the burst are 60 s and @xmath31 erg @xmath19 , respectively @xcite .",
    "observations with the  x - ray telescope ( xrt ) started 47 min after the burst , and revealed an uncatalogued source at @xmath1= , @xmath32= ( j2000 ) with an uncertainty of about @xmath33 and a flux of @xmath34 erg @xmath19 s@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "no object was detected by the  uv / optical telescope ( uvot ) in the first 8 hours to a limit of @xmath35 mag and @xmath36 mag , at a mean time of 2.49 and 2.59 hr , respectively @xcite .",
    "we initiated observations of  with the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ) mounted on the keck i 10-m telescope about 6.4 hr after the burst .",
    "we obtained simultaneous @xmath37- and @xmath38-band observations and detected an object close to the center of the xrt error circle at @xmath1= , @xmath32= ( j2000 ) , with a brightness @xmath39 mag and @xmath40 mag ( figure  [ fig : lris ] ) .",
    "the spectral slope between the two bands , @xmath41 , is too sharp for host galaxy extinction , and instead suggests a redshift @xmath42 .",
    "contemporaneous observations with ukirt revealed a near - ir counterpart with a brightness of @xmath43 mag @xcite .    following the identification of the afterglow we used lris to obtain two 900-s spectra with a @xmath44 wide slit .",
    "the spectra were reduced using standard iraf routines , while rectification and sky subtraction were performed using the method of @xcite .",
    "wavelength calibration was performed using hgarnezncd arc lamps and air - to - vacuum and heliocentric corrections were applied .",
    "the resulting dispersion scales are 1.86  / pix for the red side and 0.61  / pix for the blue side , with an rms wavelength uncertainty of about 0.2 .",
    "finally , flux calibration was performed using the spectrophotometric standard bd+284211 , with a correction for the small amount of galactic extinction , @xmath45 mag @xcite .",
    "convolution of the spectrum with the @xmath38 filter bandpass results in a flux density of @xmath46 @xmath47jy ( @xmath48 mag ) , in very good agreement with the measured @xmath38-band magnitude .",
    "this indicates that slit losses were minimal .",
    "we identify three redshift systems in the extracted spectrum , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "we associate the redshift system @xmath52 with the host galaxy of given the nature of the absorption lines ( see  [ sec : abs ] ) and the lack of ly@xmath1 forest absorption redward of the damped ly@xmath1 feature at the redshift @xmath52 . at this redshift , using the standard cosmology ( @xmath53 km s@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) , the isotropic - equivalent @xmath56-ray energy release is @xmath57 erg , while the x - ray luminosity extrapolated to @xmath58 hr ( assuming the typical @xmath59 ) is @xmath60 erg s@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "both values are at the high end of the distribution for previous grbs @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of  is dominated by a broad absorption feature centered on an observed wavelength of about 6400 , which we identify as ly@xmath1 .",
    "a voigt profile fit to the ly@xmath1 absorption feature results in a column density of neutral hydrogen , @xmath61 , indicating that the absorber is a dla , with one of the highest column densities measured to date in either qso or grb sight lines @xcite .",
    "we note that the actual column density may be somewhat higher since , unlike in the case of quasars , the grb is embedded in the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "the average flux decrement between ly@xmath1 and ly@xmath62 is about 0.55 , which is in good agreement with the values measured in quasar sight lines at the same redshift @xcite .",
    "blueward of the damped ly@xmath1 feature we detect absorption from the ly@xmath1 forest , likely mixed with metal absorption features of oxygen , silicon , nitrogen , sulfur , carbon , and iron . due to the low resolution of our spectrum we can not disentangle the contribution of the metals from the forest .",
    "we also detect ly@xmath62 absorption , and at a wavelength of about 4880  we detect the lyman limit .",
    "redward of the ly@xmath1 absorption feature we detect a wide range of metal lines .",
    "the identifications , observed wavelengths , and equivalent widths ( ews ) of these lines are listed in table  [ tab : lines ] .",
    "we note that in some cases these lines are blended with absorption features from the lower redshift system at @xmath63 .",
    "most of the lines detected in the spectrum appear to be saturated .",
    "we can obtain a lower limit on the column density assuming the optically thin case @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the oscillator strength , @xmath66 is the equivalent width , and @xmath67 is the rest wavelength .",
    "the resulting lower limits for each transition are listed in table  [ tab : lines ] .    since most of the lines are saturated and therefore do not lie on the linear part of the curve of growth ( cog ) we construct a joint cog for all the detected transitions which do not suffer from strong blending . in this case",
    "we use the standard formulation @xcite @xmath68 where the line center s optical depth is given by @xmath69 and the function @xmath70{\\rm d}x.\\ ] ] we assume that all species share the same value of the doppler parameter , @xmath71 , and we fit iteratively for @xmath71 and the column density of each species ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting best - fit cog is shown in figure  [ fig : cog ] , and the column densities are listed in table  [ tab : columns ] .",
    "we find that lines of and are well - described by the linear part of the cog , lines of are mildly saturated , and most other species lie on the flat portion of the cog .",
    "we stress that given the assumption of a single @xmath71 value , as well as the low resolution of our spectrum , the derived column densities of the strongly saturated lines should still be considered as rough lower limits .    with this caveat in mind",
    "we derive the following abundances from the cog analysis .",
    "the column density of is @xmath72 , leading to an abundance relative to the solar value of @xmath73}\\approx -1.2 $ ] ; here we use the compilation of solar abundances of @xcite .",
    "sulfur is a non - refractory element and its gas - phase abundance therefore closely matches the gas metallicity . the derived value is roughly similar to those of both qso- and grb - dlas .",
    "the column density of @xmath74 indicates an abundance of @xmath75}\\approx -2.0 $ ] , which is similar to the mean value for qso - dlas at a similar redshift range ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the ratio of sulfur to iron , @xmath76}\\approx 0.8 $ ] , however , is at the high end of values measured for qso - dlas , which at @xmath75}\\approx -2.0 $ ] range from about 0.1 to 1 @xcite .",
    "since iron is a strongly depleted element , the large value of [ s / fe ] suggests a high dust content , similar to the inference made in several other grb - dlas @xcite .    inspecting the abundances of other ions",
    "we find that @xmath77 } \\approx -1.6 $ ] , when we sum the contributions of and .",
    "the ratio compared to iron is @xmath78}\\approx   0.4 $ ] , which is in excellent agreement with the median value of about 0.4 for qso - dlas @xcite .    using the abundances of sulfur , silicon , and iron we provide a comparison to the milky way depletion patterns in figure  [ fig : dep ] .",
    "we consider the four typical patterns of warm halo ( wh ) , warm disk+halo ( wdh ) , warm disk ( wd ) , and cool disk ( cd ) clouds @xcite , and follow the method of @xcite to determine the metallicity and dust - to - gas ratio in each case .",
    "we find that the first three depletion patterns provide an adequate representation of the data with a metallicity @xmath3 @xmath4 and dust - to - gas ratios of 1.1 ( wh ) , 0.95 ( wdh ) , and 0.85 ( wd ) .",
    "the cool disk depletion pattern does not provide an adequate fit since it underestimates the silicon abundance and over - estimates the iron abundance .",
    "given the inferred metallicities and dust - to - gas ratios we calculate a rest - frame @xmath79-band extinction of about @xmath80 mag .",
    "the most prominent metal absorption feature in the spectrum of , with a total rest - frame equivalent width of about 11.6 , is a blend of @xmath81 .",
    "the overall velocity spread of this feature is about 950 km s@xmath9 , extending blueward of the systemic redshift of the host galaxy , as defined by other metal absorption features ( figure  [ fig : civ - siiv ] ) .",
    "the wide velocity spread is not observed in any of the other low- or high - ionization features ; for example the limit on blue - shifted is @xmath82 , at least a factor of thirty below the column density .",
    "it is not clear from the low resolution spectrum if the velocity structure is due to a set of discrete absorbers or to a relatively uniform distribution of .",
    "regardless of this distinction , the observed velocity range is much larger than the typical values associated with the rotation or velocity dispersion of individual galaxies , including those observed in past grb absorption spectra ( e.g. , grb000926 with @xmath83 km s@xmath9 ; @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , blueshifted absorption by interstellar low- and high - ionization gas has been detected in the stacked spectra of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) , but with a typical velocity shift relative to the nebular emission lines of only @xmath84 km s@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite find evidence for outflows in @xmath85 lensed galaxies which approach 800 km s@xmath9 , but these outflows are evident in low - ionization lines of , , and . in local bright starburst galaxies outflow velocities",
    "are typically @xmath86 km s@xmath9 @xcite . therefore , unless the wind from the host galaxy of  is unusually fast , we consider this interpretation unlikely",
    ". this would particularly be the case if the host of  is similar to those of other grbs , which tend to have relatively low masses @xcite and would therefore have escape velocities much smaller than @xmath8 km s@xmath9 .",
    "the absorption may be alternatively related to an extended large - scale structure along the line of sight .",
    "@xcite find a strong correlation between the location of absorbers in quasar sight lines and the location of lbgs .",
    "in particular , for a column density of @xmath87 @xmath19 ( as observed in the spectrum of ) about @xmath88 of the absorbers lie within @xmath89 km s@xmath9 and @xmath90 of an lbg .",
    "while this velocity range is similar to the one observed here , it has been argued that the actual outflow velocities are @xmath91 km s@xmath9 @xcite , and that the extent of the bubbles may be a reflection of pre - galactic enrichment at @xmath92 by slower winds from dwarf galaxies @xcite . since here we directly detect an outflow with @xmath93 km s@xmath9 it is unlikely to be related to the bubbles discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "another possibility in the context of an extended structure is that the absorption arises from an overlapping structure of galactic halos , perhaps stretched out along a dark matter filament .",
    "this hypothesis is difficult to assess with a single absorption spectrum .",
    "however , if such structures are ubiquitous they should be observed in a large fraction of grb absorption spectra , as well as in quasar absorption spectra .",
    "studies of systems in quasar spectra suggest that these systems are strongly clustered for velocity shifts of @xmath94 km s@xmath9 and are essentially uncorrelated for @xmath95 km s@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "thus , we conclude that the observed velocity structure is not due to a galactic - scale phenomenon .    in the context of a massive star progenitor ,",
    "an attractive alternative is that the velocity structure is the signature of a fast wind .",
    "a similar inference was made in the case of grb021004 , which exhibited a complex velocity structure extending from about 140 to 3000 km s@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the presence of such a fast outflow led to the general conclusion that the progenitor was a wolf - rayet star .",
    "however , unlike in the case presented here , the velocity structure in the spectrum of grb021004 was evident in both low- and high - ionization lines , including .",
    "this raised the difficulty of explaining the presence of both types of species in the highly - ionized burst environment , as well as the presence of a large column of hydrogen in a wolf - rayet wind .",
    "while these difficulties prevented a definitive explanation of the high - velocity absorbers , two main possibilities have been discussed .",
    "@xcite argue that to reach the observed expansion velocities , radiative acceleration of the pre - existing fragmented shell nebula is required . in this model",
    "the interaction of the fast wolf - rayet wind with the slower winds of earlier mass loss episodes results in a fragmented structure due to rayleigh - taylor instabilities .",
    "the radiation pressure produced by the grb and afterglow emission then accelerates the fragmented shell nebula to velocities of hundreds to thousands of km s@xmath9 .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , produce hydrodynamic numerical simulations of the interactions of various mass - loss phases ( fast main sequence wind , slow red supergiant wind , and a fast wolf - rayet wind ) , and conclude that these interactions lead to a clumpy structure with a velocity range in excess of 2000 km s@xmath9 .",
    "the fragmented and clumpy structure of the wind is a common theme in both scenarios , and is used to explain the similar kinematic structure in both the low- and high - ionization lines .    in the case of  the velocity structure is only apparent in , suggesting that a more uniform wind structure is allowed .",
    "still , the effect of the ionizing radiation of the grb has to be taken into account .",
    "since the recombination timescale is expected to be significantly longer than the lifetime of the grb ( unless the density is @xmath96 @xmath6 ; @xcite ) , we can estimate the size of the ionized region roughly as @xmath97 cm ; here @xmath98 is the total energy in photons that can ionize , @xmath99 @xmath100 is the photoionization cross - section , and @xmath101 ev is the ionization threshold energy . clearly , a detailed photoionization calculation is required , but we conclude that outside of a few parsec ions should remain intact .",
    "we stress that the minimum radius for survival of ions is a factor of about 3.5 times smaller than that of , so that the non - detection of outflowing can not be simply attributed to photoionization .",
    "thus , the observations require a fast - moving ( @xmath102 km s@xmath9 ) wind , enriched in carbon and deficient in silicon , and with a radius of at least a few parsec .",
    "these requirements can be naturally satisfied in the case of a wolf - rayet wind for which typical velocities can easily exceed @xmath8 km s@xmath9 and extend out to a distance of @xmath103 pc @xcite .",
    "the lack of silicon absorption , with a column density that is at least a factor of thirty lower than that of , provides interesting constraints on the nature of the progenitor .",
    "calculations of theoretical profiles of and in the winds from a range of massive stars suggest that while strong absorption is nearly always present , the presence of lines depends sensitively on a star s mass and metallicity @xcite .",
    "thus , the wind from progenitors with a low mass and metallicity will have negligible absorption .",
    "for example , in the case of a wind from a 25 m@xmath11 star at the end of core hydrogen burning the ratio of to matches the observed limit of @xmath104 for @xmath105 @xmath4 , while for a 60 m@xmath11 star the theoretical ratio is @xmath106 even for @xmath107 @xmath4 .",
    "these considerations indicate that the progenitor of  was most likely a carbon - rich ( wc ) wolf - rayet star with a relatively low mass ( @xmath10 m@xmath11 ) and metallicity ( @xmath105 @xmath4 ) .    however , radiatively - driven winds follow a mass loss rate metallicity relation , @xmath108 @xcite and therefore single stars reach the wolf - rayet phase at a higher mass when their metallicity is low ; in the galaxy @xmath109 m@xmath11 , while in the smc @xmath110 m@xmath11 @xcite . with a metallicity of @xmath12 @xmath4 and a mass of only @xmath111 m@xmath11",
    ", it appears that the progenitor of  was not sufficiently massive to have become a wolf - rayet star .",
    "it is therefore likely that the progenitor required a companion star in order to eject the hydrogen envelope .",
    "[ [ section ] ] * ~    another interesting feature of the spectrum of  is the detection of strong fine - structure absorption from * .",
    "since these transitions have not been convincingly detected in qso - dlas ( e.g. , @xcite ) and since they are most likely excited by collisions with electrons ( for @xmath112 k ; @xcite ) , we conclude that the * absorber is coincident with the local , high density environment of the grb . in figure",
    "[ fig : siii ] we show the three detected and * transitions .",
    "we note that the @xmath113 and * @xmath114 pair is located in the atmospheric b - band , therefore precluding a clear measurement of the equivalent widths .",
    "in addition , due to the low spectral resolution , the @xmath115 transition is blended with @xmath116 and @xmath115 , although given the large oscillator strength of the transition , it likely dominates the measured equivalent width .",
    "our estimate of the column density is thus based primarily on @xmath117 and on * @xmath118 ( figure  [ fig : siii ] ) .",
    "the absorption lines of both species are saturated and the ratio of column densities is therefore somewhat uncertain , although it is clear that the column of * is fairly large ; using the weakest , unblended line of * under the assumption of the optically thin case we find @xmath119 .",
    "this value is somewhat higher than those found in two previous grb spectra : @xmath120 ( grb030323 ; @xcite ) and @xmath121 ( grb020813 ; @xcite ) , but the rough similarity may reflect comparable physical conditions in the local environments of grbs .    using the cog analysis",
    "we find that the ratio of column densities is @xmath122 with this value , and using the calculations of @xcite , we estimate that for a temperature of @xmath8 k ( i.e. , a neutral medium ) , the implied volume density of is @xmath123 @xmath6 if the electron fraction is @xmath124 .",
    "if the electron fraction is @xmath125 , as may be expected for a neutral medium in which the electrons primarily come from low - ionization species with an abundance relative to hydrogen of @xmath126 @xcite , the density is @xmath127 @xmath6 . in this framework , the size of the absorbing region is @xmath128 pc assuming that the hydrogen is co - located with the * absorber .",
    "the inferred mass of the absorbing region is @xmath129 m@xmath11 .",
    "naturally , if only a fraction of the column is associated with the * absorber , then the derived mass and size are in fact upper limits .",
    "the inferred compact size of the absorber explains the non - detection of * in the qso - dlas , since the probability of intersecting a region of only a few parsec in size is vanishingly small .",
    "we note that there are two difficulties with this interpretation if we insist that the compact * absorber has to be placed around the grb .",
    "first , in order to survive the burst of ionizing radiation from the grb ( which affects the environment on a scale of @xmath130 pc ) the absorber has to be shielded .",
    "second , as discussed in the previous section , the wind from the progenitor star appears to be deficient in silicon , and another source for the may be required .",
    "these arguments suggest that the is located in the vicinity of the grb , but is probably not directly associated with the progenitor star itself , and is instead a signature of the dense environment in the star forming region .",
    "absorption lines of molecular hydrogen may be detected in the spectrum of  if the burst occurred in a dense molecular cloud .",
    "unfortunately , at the low resolution of our spectrum it is essentially impossible to discern @xmath131 absorption lines from the ly@xmath1 forest and transitions due to metals .",
    "we note that in general the molecular fraction in dlas is @xmath132 , and only a small number of dlas exhibit detectable fractions of @xmath131 @xcite .",
    "the explanation for this trend is a combination of a low dust content and fairly intense far - uv radiation field , which combine to reduce the formation rate of @xmath131 and increase the photodissociation rate , respectively @xcite .",
    "however , if grbs tend to occur in molecular clouds , grb - dlas may exhibit preferentially higher fractions of molecular hydrogen , particularly in light of the fairly large dust - to - gas ratios in comparison to qso - dlas @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "as discussed in detail by @xcite , the optical / uv radiation from the grb itself is expected to photoionize and dissociate @xmath131 molecules to a distance of a few parsec .",
    "if the cloud hosting the grb progenitor is smaller than this size , or if the burst is located near the edge of the cloud we expect that no @xmath131 absorption features will be detected even if the molecular fraction was initially high .",
    "if the cloud is sufficiently large , the uv radiation field is expected to also excite @xmath131 into vibrational levels which will produce observable absorption features at rest - wavelengths of @xmath133@xcite .",
    "the strongest features are at @xmath134  and @xmath135 .",
    "while we detect an absorption feature coincident with the 1277.3  line , we interpret this feature as @xmath136 whose equivalent width is in good agreement with other lines .",
    "the non - detection of vibrational @xmath137 absorption , under the assumption that the cloud size is sufficiently large , places a limit of @xmath138 @xmath19 @xcite , and hence @xmath139 .",
    "we do not detect ly@xmath1 in emission with a @xmath140 limit of @xmath141 erg @xmath19 s@xmath9 . at the redshift of the burst this limit translates to an upper limit on the line luminosity of @xmath142 erg s@xmath9 . using the conversion of @xcite and assuming case b recombination , the limit on the star formation rate implied by the non - detection of ly@xmath1 emission is @xmath143 m@xmath11 yr@xmath9 .",
    "the limit on the inferred star formation rate is about a factor of three higher than the value inferred for grb030323 at @xmath144 @xcite , but it is significantly lower than the value measured for grb021004 ,",
    "@xmath145 m@xmath11 yr@xmath9 , based on ly@xmath1 emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in fact , nearly every grb host in which ly@xmath1 emission can be detected has been detected @xcite , while the fraction of lbgs with ly@xmath1 equivalent widths similar to those in grb hosts is only @xmath146 @xcite .",
    "we note that the lack of ly@xmath1 emission may still accommodate a star formation rate higher than our formal limit since the ly@xmath1 photons are easily destroyed by resonant scattering in the presence of dust .",
    "thus , even for a fairly low dust content it is possible that the star formation rate is in fact higher than the limit provided above .",
    "a better assessment of the star formation rate requires near - ir spectroscopy of the host galaxy for detection of h@xmath1 at @xmath147 @xmath47 m and/or [ ] @xmath148 at 1.97 @xmath47 m .",
    "we detect two intervening systems at @xmath63 and @xmath149 .",
    "the latter is detected only in with a rest - frame equivalent width of 1.98  ( @xmath150 ) and 0.94  ( @xmath151 ) .",
    "these values match the expected @xmath152 ratio in the optically thin case , suggesting that the lines are not saturated .",
    "the derived column density is about @xmath153 @xmath19 .",
    "a comparison to the sample of @xcite reveals that @xmath154 of quasar sight lines reveal systems with similarly large equivalent widths .",
    "however , unlike the observed doublet ratio of about two measured here , the range of doublet ratios for the quasar systems with @xmath155   is typically @xmath156 , indicative of strong saturation .",
    "we finally note that for a magnesium abundance of about @xmath157 the solar value , the inferred column density in the @xmath158 system suggests an associated neutral hydrogen column density of @xmath159 @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath160 redshift system exhibits a wider range of absorption features , but unfortunately , some of these lines are blended with features from the host galaxy . still , several lines , as well as the doublet , and a single line are not blended , allowing us to estimate the column density of some metals in the @xmath160 system .",
    "a cog fit to the three lines indicates @xmath161 km s@xmath9 and @xmath162 .",
    "the ratio of about 0.85 indicates strong saturation , and a lower limit on the column density of @xmath163 , assuming the same doppler parameter as for the lines . finally , assuming that the single line is optically thin we estimate @xmath164 .",
    "thus , the relative abundance is @xmath165}\\gtrsim -0.7 $ ] , while in dlas it is typically @xmath166 .",
    "this suggests that we may be underestimating the by about 0.7 dex .",
    "we also note that both iron and manganese are strongly depleted in the galaxy , while elements such as zinc are relatively undepleted @xcite . in our case ,",
    "the @xmath167 line is blended with from the host galaxy system . however , using the measured equivalent width as an upper limit and assuming the optically thin case , we find @xmath168 .",
    "thus , @xmath169}>-0.5 $ ] and @xmath170}>-1.2 $ ] are in agreement with the typical values measured for dlas of about @xmath171 and @xmath172 , respectively , particularly if the abundance of is in fact underestimated as suggested above .",
    "the absorption spectrum of grb050505 exhibits a dla with a column density of @xmath173 associated with the host galaxy .",
    "the measured column is higher than that of any qso - dla studied to date , but is similar to those measured for several grb - dlas , albeit at the highest redshift to date . in figure",
    "[ fig : dla ] we provide a summary of the column densities measured from both quasars and grbs to date . as already noted in @xcite ,",
    "these distributions differ significantly , presumably as a result of the smaller impact parameters in the case of grb - dlas and the possibility that they probe individual dense star forming regions .",
    "the metallicity we infer for , @xmath3 @xmath4 , is within the range of values measured for qso - dlas at a similar redshift @xcite , but is a factor of several higher than the mean metallicity of about @xmath174 @xmath4 .",
    "this , along with the metallicities inferred for five additional grb - dlas , is shown in figure  [ fig : metal_z ] . in the top panel",
    "we plot the metallicity as determined from various indicators as a function of redshift in comparison to qso - dlas . for the qso sample",
    ", @xcite noted an apparent trend of increased metallicity with lower redshift .",
    "a similar trend appears in the admittedly small grb - dla sample which spans from @xmath175 to 4.3 .",
    "however , it is also clear that the grb - dlas have systematically higher metallicities compared to qso - dlas . in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : metal_z ]",
    "we plot the metallicity as a function of hydrogen column density .",
    "no clear trend is evident , perhaps suggesting that the higher metallicities in grb - dlas may not be simply a function of the column density , but may reflect a difference in the star formation properties , rates , or history of grb - selected host galaxies compared to qso - dlas .",
    "we highlight two aspects of the spectrum , which provide insight into scales and conditions that are not typically probed in quasar sight lines : a outflow that is most likely associated with the wind of the progenitor star , and strong absorption from fine - structure * that is associated with a dense region in the vicinity of the burst .",
    "the latter suggests that the grb progenitor lived in an environment typical of a molecular cloud .",
    "the outflow , taken in association with the lack of corresponding absorption suggests that the progenitor star had a relatively low mass and metallicity , @xmath176 m@xmath11 and @xmath105 @xmath4 .",
    "the combination of these properties suggests that the progenitor was part of a binary system , with the companion responsible for stripping the hydrogen envelope .",
    "the continued detection of high - velocity features in grb absorption spectra may thus hold the only key to a detailed understanding of the distribution of progenitor properties ( mass , metallicity , binarity ) , as well as the ability to probe the properties of individual molecular clouds at high redshift .",
    "coupled with information on the galactic scale properties of the ism , grbs can probe all the scales relevant to our understanding of the star formation process and its relation to metal production , as well as the relation between dlas and star forming galaxies .",
