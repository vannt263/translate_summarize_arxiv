    "we consider an action functional @xmath0 which is invariant under the action of a finite group @xmath6 which acts freely on the critical set of @xmath0 .",
    "this gives rise to two floer homologies where the chain complex of the first one is generated by critical points of @xmath0 and the chain complex of the second one is generated by @xmath6-orbits of critical points of @xmath0 .",
