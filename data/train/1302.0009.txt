    "a small fraction of massive stars end their lives with spectacular explosions one or two orders of magnitude more luminous than normal supernovae ( sne ) . after the initial puzzling discoveries of the luminous sne  2005ap @xcite and 2006gy @xcite , modern wide - field surveys over the past decade began to uncover these superluminous sne ( slsne ) in greater numbers .",
    "the energy scales involved in these explosions challenge our understanding of conventional sn explosions .",
    "normal sne resulting from iron core collapse have characteristic energy scales of @xmath310@xmath15 erg of kinetic energy and @xmath310@xmath16 erg emitted as optical radiation ( @xmath310@xmath17 erg s@xmath6 for @xmath310@xmath18 s ) .",
    "the slsne are far off this scale they peak at optical luminosities of up to @xmath34@xmath19 erg s@xmath6 @xcite and emit a total of up to 4@xmath410@xmath15 erg optically @xcite .",
    "this large energy scale motivates the question of what physics powers these sne , and how to accommodate these objects within the standard understanding of massive star evolution .",
    "theorists have proposed a number of exotic power sources , including the pair instability mechanism ( e.g. , @xcite ) and reprocessed spindown energy released by a newly formed magnetar @xcite .",
    "another possibility is interaction with a dense circumstellar medium ( csm ) @xcite , requiring extreme csm masses and densities whose origin remains unexplained ( see @xcite for one possibility ) .",
    "all of these models require additional ingredients beyond the normal stellar evolutionary processes .",
    "@xcite has attempted to impose order on the menagerie of objects achieving sufficient peak luminosities to be classified as slsne ( @xmath20 mag is a typical requirement ) by sorting them into three categories .",
    "all of the hydrogen - rich objects were classified as slsne - ii and all exhibit signs of being powered by dense csm interaction , with the possible exception of sn  2008es @xcite .",
    "he split the objects lacking hydrogen into two classes , the rare slsne - r that have slow photometric decline rates consistent with being powered by the radioactive decay of a very large synthesized mass of @xmath21ni , and the relatively homogeneous class of slsne - i , whose power source is still mysterious .",
    "a few caveats have been raised .",
    "the slsne - r are interpreted to be the results of pair - instability sne . however , existing models for the pair instability process prefer extremely low metallicity , and may be in conflict with the observed spectrum and spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of slsne - r ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "also , it is not clear how homogeneous the slsne - i class really is .",
    "although the spectra of most appear to be similar to those of sn  2005ap and scp06f6 @xcite , the rise times and peak luminosities of published objects vary by factors of @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "all slsne - i to date have had hot spectra and been bright in the rest - frame near - ultraviolet ( nuv ) relative to normal sn seds .    in this paper",
    ", we present the discovery of ps1 - 10afx , an extreme slsn at redshift @xmath0 that does not fit into this classification scheme and is distinct from all previous slsne .",
    "the peak luminosity is comparable to the highest known and the rise time is the fastest measured . the spectra show no evidence for hydrogen and lack any analog in the existing sample of slsne .",
    "instead , they most closely resemble those of line - blanketed normal sne ic . in section 2",
    ", we present the suite of optical and near - infrared ( nir ) observations .",
    "the host galaxy is described in section 3 .",
    "we compare our observations of ps1 - 10afx  to known sne in section 4 . in section 5 , we construct the sed and bolometric light curve .",
    "we then compare ps1 - 10afx  to existing slsn models in section 6 .",
    "all calculations in this paper assume a flat @xmath22cdm cosmology with @xmath23=74  km  s@xmath6  mpc@xmath6 , @xmath24=0.27 , and @xmath25=0.73 @xcite .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    the pan - starrs1 ( ps1 ) telescope has a 1.8  m diameter primary mirror that images a field with a diameter of 3.3 @xcite onto a total of sixty @xmath26 pixel detectors , with a pixel scale of 0.258@xcite . a more complete description of the ps1 system , hardware and software , is provided by @xcite .",
    "the ps1 observations are obtained through a set of five broadband filters , designated as @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    "although the filter system for ps1 has much in common with that used in previous surveys , such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) , there are differences .",
    "most important for this work , the @xmath30  filter is cut off at 9300   , giving it a different response than the detector response defined @xmath32 , and sdss has no corresponding @xmath31  filter .",
    "further information on the passband shapes is described by @xcite .",
    "photometry is in the `` natural '' ps1 system , @xmath33 , with a single zeropoint adjustment @xmath34 made in each band to conform to the ab magnitude scale @xcite .",
    "photometry from all other sources presented in this paper is also on the ab scale .",
    "ps1 magnitudes are interpreted as being at the top of the atmosphere , with 1.2 airmasses of atmospheric attenuation being included in the system response function .",
    "the ps1 medium deep survey ( mds ) consists of 10 fields across the sky that are observed nightly when in season ( @xmath35 months per year ) with a typical cadence of 3  d between observations in @xmath27@xmath28@xmath29@xmath30  in dark and gray time , while @xmath31  is used near full moon .",
    "ps1 data are processed through the image processing pipeline ( ipp ; @xcite ) on a computer cluster at the maui high performance computer center .",
    "the pipeline runs the images through a succession of stages , including flat - fielding ( `` de - trending '' ) , a flux - conserving warping to a sky - based image plane , masking and artifact removal , and object detection and photometry .",
    "transient detection using ipp photometry is carried out at queen s university belfast .",
    "independently , difference images are produced from the stacked nightly mds images by the ` photpipe ` pipeline @xcite running on the odyssey computer cluster at harvard university .",
    "the discovery and data presented here are from the ` photpipe ` analysis .",
    "ps1 - 10afx  was first detected in mds imaging on 2010 august 31.35 ( ut dates are used throughout this paper ) at a position of @xmath35 = 22@xmath3611@xmath3724162 , @xmath38 = @xmath390009@xmath404349 ( j2000 ) , with an uncertainty of 0@xmath411 in each coordinate .",
    "the strong detections in @xmath29  and @xmath30  combined with non - detections in @xmath27  and @xmath28  over the next few nights immediately garnered our attention .",
    "the unusual colors are evident in the color images of the field presented in figure  [ hostfig ] .",
    "we constructed deep template stacks from all pre - explosion images and subtracted them from the ps1 observations using ` photpipe ` @xcite .",
    "details of the photometry and generation of ps1 sn light curves will be given by rest et al .",
    "( 2013 , in prep . ) and scolnic et al .",
    "( 2013 , in prep . ) .",
    "the typical spacing between mds observations in the same filter corresponds to only 1.3  d in the rest frame of ps1 - 10afx , so in some cases we have co - added the photometry from adjacent observations to increase the significance of marginal detections or the depth of the non - detections .",
    "the final ps1 - 10afx  photometry , after correction for @xmath42  mag of galactic extinction @xcite , is given in table  [ phottab ] and shown in figure  [ multiplot ] .",
    "we fit polynomials to the @xmath30  data points within 15 rest - frame days of peak to determine the time of maximum light , for which we adopt a modified julian date ( mjd ) of 55457.0 ( = 2010 september 18.0 ) .",
    "all phases referred to subsequently are in rest - frame days referenced from this date .",
    "in addition to the ps1 observations , we obtained two epochs of multicolor photometry using the gemini multi - object spectrographs ( gmos ; @xcite ) on the 8-m gemini - north and south telescopes and one epoch of imaging using the inamori - magellan areal camera and spectrograph ( imacs ; @xcite ) on the 6.5-m magellan baade telescope .",
    "the images were processed using standard tasks and then archival fringe frames were subtracted from the gmos images using the ` gemini ` iraf package .",
    "we used several sdss stars in the field to calibrate the gemini images , while the imacs zeropoints were checked with observations of standard star fields obtained the same night .",
    "we subtracted the deep ps1 templates in the corresponding filter from each image using the isis software package @xcite to correct for host contamination .",
    "the final photometry is listed in table  [ phottab ] .",
    "the @xmath43 and @xmath44 magnitudes agree well with the ps1 observations at similar epochs . however , the @xmath45 observations exhibit an offset from the @xmath30  light curve due to the filter response differences noted above ( gmos and imacs are closer to sdss ) .",
    "we therefore add 0.2 mag to the @xmath45 photometry points for consistency with @xmath30  whenever we refer to the combined @xmath46-band light curve .",
    "finally , we obtained late - time observations of the host galaxy in @xmath47 and @xmath43 on 2011 october 21.1 ( phase @xmath39167  d ) using the low dispersion survey spectrograph-3 ( ldss3 ) on the 6.5-m magellan clay telescope ( table  [ hosttab ] ) .",

    "this is unsatisfactory for two reasons .",
    "first , ps1 - 10afx  is already more luminous in the nuv than the sn  2005ap - like objects ( see below ) , so @xmath83  mag would imply an upward correction of two orders of magnitude to an already extreme peak luminosity .",
    "second , the strongest uv spectral features of the sn 2005ap - like objects are the trio of features blueward of 3000    first seen in scp06f6 @xcite , with the continuum redward of that being largely smooth except for features @xcite .",
    "ps1 - 10afx   has fundamentally different spectral features with no correspondence in the ps1 - 10ky spectrum ,",
    "so the simplest explanation is that it has an intrinsically cooler photosphere .",
    "the sn iin 1998s is shown in figure  [ uvcomp ] as a well - studied example of a sn undergoing strong csm interaction .",
    "sn 1998s at this phase showed no broad p - cygni features in the uv , but had a blue continuum with narrow absorption lines from interstellar and circumstellar material @xcite .",
    "the slsne 2006gy and 2006tf are higher - luminosity versions of sne dominated by hydrogen - rich csm interaction @xcite .",
    "these objects have redder spectra than sn 1998s , but still exhibit balmer lines and deep narrow absorptions that have no analog in the ps1 - 10afx  spectrum .",
    "the slsn 2008es had almost featureless blue spectra near maximum light @xcite , but the plotted spectrum is from a later epoch when balmer lines were beginning to develop strength in the rest - frame optical spectrum .",
    "the nuv spectrum of the broad - lined sn ic 2002ap is included because the engine - driven sne associated with grbs have similar spectra , even if 2002ap itself was not unusually luminous @xcite .",
    "sn 2002ap has much broader and more blended features than ps1 - 10afx .",
    "thus , none of these objects in figure  [ uvcomp ] resembles ps1 - 10afx .",

    ", the set of spectra from normal sne plotted in figure  [ uvcomplog ] provide a much better basis for comparison .",
    "the sne ia and sn 1993j ( type iib ) spectra have been blueshifted by the indicated amounts to approximately match the absorption minima to ps1 - 10afx . over the range 2800@xmath484000   , the spectra in figure  [ uvcomplog ]",

    "shortward of @xmath32800   , the sne ia diverge from the core - collapse objects .",
    "this dropoff in flux , along with a pair of deep absorption features near 2450    and 2600   , is caused by iron - group elements , primarily @xcite .",
    "the lack of these features in ps1 - 10afx  is evidence that the abundance of newly - synthesized @xmath21ni ( which decays to @xmath21co ) near the photosphere is much lower than in a sn  ia .",
    "one purpose of these comparisons is to demonstrate the apparent broad similarity of the nuv spectra of ps1 - 10afx  to those of sne coming from three very different progenitors : a bare core of a massive star ( sn 1994i : @xcite ) , a partially - stripped massive star in a binary system that retained part of its hydrogen envelope ( sn 1993j : @xcite ) , and the thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs ( sne 2011fe and 2011iv : @xcite ) .",
    "sne 2011fe and 2011iv have some spectral differences from each other near 3000   , exhibiting the potential for spectroscopic variation in objects with similar progenitors .",
    "other than the lack of cobalt near the photosphere , the remaining differences between ps1 - 10afx  and these other objects are relatively minor .",
    "in addition , the overall uv spectral slope of ps1 - 10afx  is very similar to those of sne 1993j and 1994i , after correction of both by @xmath84  mag of reddening @xcite .",
    "the fact that the only sne in figures [ uvcomp ] and [ uvcomplog ] that have similar spectral features to ps1 - 10afx  also have similar sed shapes provides further evidence that the extinction of ps1 - 10afx  is not large . if the ps1 - 10afx  spectra were corrected for a large amount of reddening , they would be bluer and we would expect different spectral features to be present at the higher implied temperatures .",
    "we further explore the spectra using the sn spectrum synthesis code ` syn++ ` with ` synapps ` @xcite to fit the near - maximum - light gmos / fire spectra .",
    "these codes are based on the same assumptions as the original ` synow `  ( e.g. , @xcite ) treatment of resonant - scattering lines in the sobolev approximation above a sharp photosphere that emits as a blackbody ( bb ) .",
    "the atomic and ionic species are assumed to have levels populated in local thermodynamic equilibrium at some excitation temperature . `",
    "synow `  is a tool designed for line identifications and is not a full self - consistent spectral model .",
    "our best ` synow `  model is shown in figure  [ synplot ] and contains seven ions .",
    "we assumed equal bb continuum and excitation temperatures of @xmath85  k and a photospheric velocity of @xmath8  km  s@xmath6 .",
    "the deep absorption trough near 3700    is dominated by h&k . and combine to produce several of the wiggles observed in the range @xmath86   .",
    "naturally explains the observed absorption near 4250   , while also producing absorption shortward of @xmath32700   .",
    "contributes to both the blue wing of the deep feature and the notch near 3950   .",
    "the feature near 3950    is present in the overlap between the gmos and fire data and has a consistent strength that is significantly larger than in the synthetic spectrum . with ` synow ` , we have to be careful not to overproduce absorption by the @xmath636355 doublet because no strong feature is seen in the data , although the s / n and the spectral resolution become very poor in the observed - frame @xmath52 .",
    "we introduce to help reproduce the wiggle near 5000   , but the identification is not unique and its presence is not required .",
    "in addition , we include to help suppress the uv flux .",
    "that ion does not contribute sufficiently strongly to any specific feature for us to make a positive identification , but it has been included in previous ` synow `  models of sne ic @xcite because of its expected strength in either helium or carbon / oxygen - rich sn ejecta at these temperatures @xcite .",
    "we also consider several other species that were not included in the final fit . as discussed above , produces strong nuv absorptions in sne ia that are not present in ps1 - 10afx .",
    "d is commonly seen in all types of sne , but at this redshift it would fall in the strong telluric absorption between @xmath51 and @xmath52 , so we have no constraint on its presence from the observations .",
    "we also tested because of its use in prior ` synow `  analyses of sne ib @xcite .",
    "scandium results in an additional absorption minimum near @xmath33500    similar to one seen in our data , but does not produce a sufficiently strong improvement in the model to justify its inclusion , particularly given the expectation that it should only become important at lower ejecta temperatures @xcite .",
    "there is also an apparent absorption feature near 5300     that is not fit by the model .",
    "can produce a feature near that wavelength , but the identification is not certain .",
    "lines of hydrogen or helium would be very important if present , but there is no evidence for either , although the low s / n of our nir data precludes strong statements about helium .",
    "the sn 2005ap - like slsne have lines of singly - ionized carbon and oxygen in their spectra at early times ( e.g. , @xcite ) , with possible contributions from doubly - ionized cno elements @xcite , but those lines do not appear to be present in our ps1 - 10afx  spectra .",
    "overall , we can reproduce the shape of the spectrum in the rest - frame optical reasonably well , but the nuv is more problematic .",
    "our synthetic spectrum has features at many of the same wavelengths as the real data , but the overall shape in the nuv is less well fit . adding additional ions to the fit might potentially help the uv shape of the synthetic spectrum , but would not be well motivated or add any additional insight .",
    "alternatively , the radiative transfer in the uv is known to be complex and we could be encountering the limitations of ` synow ` .",
    "the most important point is that the ions we have used are typical for generic fits to sne ia and ic spectra ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but differ from those identified in most slsne - i spectra near maximum light @xcite .",
    "existing light curves of slsne are heterogeneous , and the objects have been found at a wide range of redshifts , making direct comparisons difficult . following previous work @xcite , in figure  [ uplot ]",
    "we compare the rest - frame @xmath87 light curve of ps1 - 10afx  ( corresponding to observed - frame @xmath30 ) to several of the most luminous sn 2005ap - like sne in the literature .",
    "in addition , we include the hydrogen - rich sn  2008es because its light curve is similar to the others and it did not develop strong balmer lines until well after maximum light @xcite . for comparison , we also plot the @xmath88 light curves of the broad - lined sne ic 1998bw and 2002ap , two objects of normal luminosities @xcite . given the uncertain seds of many of these objects , we do not perform a full @xmath89-correction , but instead correct the observed ab magnitudes in filters whose effective wavelengths are close to @xmath87 in the observed frame by @xmath90d@xmath91(@xmath46)/10 pc ) @xmath48 2.5 @xmath92(1+@xmath46 ) , where d@xmath91 is the luminosity distance . to be conservative , we assume that ps1 - 10afx  is unaffected by reddening here and in all following discussion , despite the strong absorption along the line of sight and the inference that the host galaxy sed requires some degree of internal extinction .",
    "we presented some evidence above that the reddening to the sn is not large , but it is possible that we have underestimated the peak luminosity of this object .",
    "it is apparent from figure  [ uplot ] that at peak ps1 - 10afx  was slightly more luminous in @xmath87 ( @xmath93  mag ) than any previous slsne .",
    "however , by @xmath310  d on either side of maximum light , ps1 - 10afx  falls below all the others .",
    "this emphasizes the high peak luminosity and fast evolution of the light curve .",
    "these objects have rather different seds , so comparisons of the energetics require constructing a bolometric light curve .    to proceed further , we first construct seds at three epochs near the times of our nir observations , at phases of @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96  d. we fit third - order polynomials to the observed photometry in each @xmath28@xmath29@xmath30  filter around each sed epoch to estimate the flux .",
    "we then estimate the error bars on these fitted fluxes by generating monte carlo realizations of the data where we repeatedly randomly adjust the observed fluxes by drawing from a normal distribution having a width of the measured errors , refitting , and determining the variance of the interpolated flux at the desired epoch .",
    "we perform a similar procedure whenever we need to interpolate fluxes to a common epoch . for the seds at phases of @xmath94 and @xmath96  d",
    ", we use the actual measured @xmath31  and nir fluxes . for the @xmath95",
    "d sed , the observed nir fluxes were quite noisy , so we again interpolate the fluxes in @xmath51 and @xmath52 by fitting second - order polynomials to the observed light curves to generate the points on the sed .",
    "the resulting sed evolution is shown in figure  [ sedplot ] .",
    "we then fit bb spectra to the seds at each epoch .",
    "our @xmath94  d sed has the most complete information .",
    "the dashed line in figure  [ sedplot ] shows the result of a bb fit to the full sed .",
    "the derived bb temperature is @xmath97  k , but clearly the curve is a poor fit to the data at rest wavelengths longward of @xmath35000   . if instead we restrict the fit to @xmath31  and the nir bands , the bb temperature is not well constrained ( @xmath98  k ) due to a lack of points blueward of the peak .",
    "the formal best fit is plotted as the solid blue line in figure  [ sedplot ] and provides a much better fit to the nir data points ( by construction ) , but significantly overestimates the rest - frame uv flux .",
    "this is to be expected if line blanketing in the nuv provided by iron - peak elements supresses the uv flux , as is typical for sne ic .",
    "for example , the shape of the sed of the normal sn ic 1994i near maximum light ( figure  [ sedplot ] ) is similar to that of ps1 - 10afx , but the detailed model fits by @xcite find an underlying bb temperature of 9230  k at the same epoch .    the data at phases @xmath95 and @xmath96  d are less complete , so we fit a simple bb to all of the points on the sed and do not correct for line blanketing , which would only be expected to increase as the ejecta cool .",
    "the derived bbs show the ejecta clearly cooling from @xmath3@xmath99  k at a phase of @xmath94  d to @xmath3@xmath100  k at @xmath96  d , although @xmath101  should only be regarded as lower limits to the effective temperature ( @xmath102 ) on the later two dates .",
    "independent of the details of line blanketing , we can directly see the sed becoming redder , and hence implying cooler temperatures , by looking at the color evolution . in figure",
    "[ colorplot ]",
    ", we construct @xmath29@xmath48@xmath30  and @xmath30@xmath103 color curves . in each case , we interpolate the light curve in the bluer band to the epochs of observation for the noisier redder band .",
    "the @xmath29@xmath48@xmath30  color is consistent with a constant ( 0.30@xmath640.05  mag ) before maximum light , but both colors became redder with time after maximum .",
    "we use the bb fits to construct a bolometric light curve , starting with the near - maximum - light sed ( phase @xmath393  d ) shown in figure  [ sedplot ] .",
    "a trapezoidal integration of the observed fluxes from @xmath28  to @xmath53 gives a minimum bolometric luminosity ( @xmath104 ) near peak of ( 3.6@xmath640.2)@xmath105  erg  s@xmath6 . to account for flux",

    "material moving at the ` synow`-derived velocity of @xmath8  km  s@xmath6  will take 58  d to reach that radius , implying an explosion @xmath350  d before our first detection .",
    "there is an observed example of such an effect with the slsn  2006 oz .",
    "it exhibited a precursor plateau with a luminosity of @xmath32@xmath410@xmath112  erg  s@xmath6 prior to rising to the main peak of the light curve , which @xcite interpreted as being due to a recombination wave in an oxygen - rich csm .",
    "a weighted average of the ps1 - 10afx  non - detections between phases @xmath132 and @xmath133  d produces a mean luminosity of ( 0.2@xmath641.2)@xmath410@xmath112  erg  s@xmath6 . at the 2@xmath134 level , this non - detection is consistent with a hypothetical plateau being present at the level seen in sn  2006 oz , but unobserved due to the limiting magnitudes of our survey .    at phases @xmath3912 and @xmath3924  d , the @xmath104  quoted above and @xmath101  shown in figure  [ sedplot ] combine to produce bb radii of 1.4 and 1.3@xmath131  cm , respectively ,",
    "although these are likely overestimated due to the underestimate of @xmath102 caused by line blanketing .",
    "notably , these values are consistent with the photosphere begining to recede through the ejecta ( in both the physical and comoving senses ) as they become optically thin .",
    "by contrast , the bb radii inferred for the interacting slsne 2006tf and 2006gy increased linearly with time at the same rate as the velocities measured from the spectra , consistent with an expanding optically - thick shell @xcite .",
    "although the measurement errors make it less certain , this also appears to be true for at least some sn 2005ap - like sne ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the kinetic energy of a powerful sn explosion provides an attractive reservoir of energy to power slsn light curves , but only if that energy can be efficiently converted to radiation . for ps1 - 10afx ,",
    "this already requires an initial sn energy of at least a @xmath13510@xmath15  erg in order for the object to radiate 10@xmath15  erg and still have ejecta velocities as high as those observed .",
    "this generally requires a csm with a mass comparable to that of the ejecta and a radius comparable to the photospheric radius at maximum light in order to maximize efficiency and not lose energy to adiabatic expansion ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "another attraction of interaction models is that the sn can explode well before the start of the optical rise of the sn if the csm is sufficiently dense to trap radiation from the shock @xcite .",
    "this could greatly alleviate the conflict described above between the rise time , ejecta velocity , and photospheric radius .",
    "the required csm densities in these models are much larger than for well - studied examples at lower luminosity . @xcite",
    "have identified two regimes of interest when the csm is this dense .",
    "if the radiation from the shock can escape while the shock is still interacting with the csm , then the light curve will be broad and exhibit a slow decay after maximum light .",
    "their model works well for the light curves of slsne like 2006gy .",
    "an additional consequence of this model is that there should be spectral signatures of the ongoing csm interaction , such as emission lines from the unshocked csm ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "other luminous sne iin in the literature , such as sne 2008fz @xcite and 2008am @xcite , with their blue continua and strong balmer emission lines , can also be fit by similar models .",
    "the much faster light curve of ps1 - 10afx  and lack of strong emission lines imply a different regime , one where the outer radius of the csm is comparable to or smaller than the diffusion length of photons from the shock . in this framework ,",
    "the optical light we detect is then associated with the breakout of the shock from the outer radius of the csm . in the context of a dense wind with a density profile that scales with radius as @xmath136 out to a maximum radius of @xmath137 , where @xmath138 is a density normalization parameter",
    ", the total mass of the wind is @xmath139 . in the models of @xcite ,",
    "@xmath138 can be estimated from the diffusion timescale as @xmath140 ( @xmath141/days ) g  cm@xmath6 , if we assume an ionized he - rich composition .",
    "we can approximate the diffusion timescale @xmath141 by the rise time and set @xmath137 to the bb radius at maximum light to produce an estimate of the wind mass of @xmath143  m@xmath12 .",
    "these values are only approximate , as @xcite have shown that in the regime of interest , the analytic approximations are outside the range of validity and require true hydrodynamic calculations .",
    "models with shock breakout occurring in a dense , truncated wind can produce bolometric light curves with the desired peak luminosities and time scales , but it is unclear if this can be done consistently with the other information about the object .",
    "@xcite were able to approximately match the light curve shapes of the slsne 2010gx and 2005ap , but the derived @xmath101  were hard to match to the observations .",
    "a theoretical caveat is that the observed color temperature could deviate from @xmath102 if the shock is not in equilibrium when it breaks out @xcite .",
    "this deviation is caused by the nature of the opacity , and usually implies that the color temperature is hotter than the true @xmath102 ( e.g. , see @xcite for models of 2006gy ) , which would in turn require that the photosphere be at even larger radii than we have found .",
    "this effect might then conflict with the fast timescale of the light curve , which otherwise is indicative of a more compact csm @xcite , but detailed modeling with radiative transfer is needed to correctly evaluate these concerns .",
    "further , a key component of the rising sn luminosity in the shock breakout models of both @xcite and @xcite is that the temperature rises to a maximum near the peak of the light curve and declines thereafter .",
    "although we lack full sed information on the rise of the light curve for ps1 - 10afx , the observed @xmath144 color shows no evolution prior to the peak of the light curve ( figure  [ colorplot ] ) . despite the interpretation uncertainties introduced by the possibilities of line blanketing or deviations from equilibrium , the evolution of @xmath101after maximum light results in a noticeable reddening of the @xmath145 color .",
    "if @xmath101  were rising by a similar amount while the light curve rose to its peak , we would have been able to detect it .",
    "a separate uncertainty is the origin of this csm , which could not be produced by steady stellar winds due to the high required mass - loss rates and the unexplained truncation at @xmath137 .",
    "most theoretical work has focused on winds , but the material could also be in a shell @xcite .",
    "@xcite invoked a pulsational pair instability to produce shells of matter at the appropriate distances , but these require very massive stars .",
    "other possibilities include common envelope ejection @xcite and instabilities in the late stages of stellar evolution @xcite .",
    "another challenge for csm interaction being the dominant contributor to the luminosity of ps1 - 10afx  is the appearance of the spectra .",
    "interaction - powered sne convert the kinetic energy of the explosion into uv / optical continuum radiation , frequently reprocessing some of the continuum into strong emission lines from the dominant constituents of the csm external to the expanding shock .",
    "the spectral comparisons in figure  [ uvcomp ] show several examples of objects consistent with this picture",
    ". however , ps1 - 10afx  is even more luminous than those objects and yet shows p - cygni features originating in the sn ejecta , including a deep absorption comparable to that seen in sn 1994i .",
    "the lack of strong emission lines from the csm can be explained if the material has a sharp outer radius , but interaction sufficiently luminous to dominate the light curve should dilute and weaken spectral features from the ejecta due to the `` top - lighting '' effect @xcite , if not completely hide emission from the unshocked ejecta .",
    "for example , ptf  09uj is a candidate for being a lower - luminosity version of a shock breakout through a dense ( hydrogen - rich ) wind and , as expected , its spectra are very blue and lack strong p - cygni features @xcite .",
    "it is not clear how strong csm interaction could dominate the luminosity of ps1 - 10afx  without leaving spectral signatures .    in summary",
    ", existing csm interaction models can match the gross photometric properties of ps1 - 10afx  ( peak luminosity , timescales ) , but only if the models have the freedom to assume the necessary csm structure .",
    "the origin of such unusual csm is not explained _ a priori _ in these models .",
    "in addition , the details of the sed , color evolution , and emitted spectra appear to be in conflict with the observations , although more detailed radiative transfer calculations are necessary to be confident in the model predictions , which are largely based on bb assumptions .",
    "normal hydrogen - deficient sne have light curves powered by the diffusion of energy deposited by the radioactive decay of @xmath21ni and @xmath21co .",
    "the light curves of most slsne - i appear to fade too rapidly relative to their peak luminosities to have radioactively - powered ejecta @xcite , and ps1 - 10afx  is no exception . with a rise time of 12  d",
    ", the peak bolometric luminosity requires a nickel mass of @xmath314  m@xmath12 .",
    "however , making standard assumptions about the structure of the ejecta @xcite allows us to use the photospheric velocity of 11,000  km  s@xmath6  and light curve timescale of 12  d ( assuming that the diffusion timescale is comparable to the rise time ) to estimate the ejecta mass as @xmath32  m@xmath12 , clearly in contradiction of the high nickel mass .",
    "another potential power source suggested for slsne is the spindown energy from a newly - born magnetar @xcite .",
    "the high luminosity and fast rise of ps1 - 10afx  stretch the existing models to the bounds of plausibility .",
    "inspection of figures  4 and 5 of @xcite shows that the light curve of ps1 - 10afx  requires a magnetar solution to have a very fast initial spin period ( @xmath146  ms , near the breakup speed of a neutron star ) , a low ejecta mass ( @xmath31  m@xmath12 ) , and a high magnetic field ( @xmath14710@xmath148  g ) .",
    "this is because the high luminosity requires a high spindown power , while the fast light curve requires both fast spindown times and short diffusion timescales .",
    "we examined magnetar - powered light curves using the formalism of @xcite and found parameters that produced light curves that approximately matched the shape of the bolometric light curve of ps1 - 10afx .",
    "one such model is plotted in figure  [ boloplot ] .    however , it is not clear whether this fit should be regarded as more than a numerical curiosity because the physical assumptions underlying the model break down . in the parameter range appropriate for ps1 - 10afx ,",
    "the magnetar dipole spindown energy ( 5@xmath410@xmath15 ( @xmath149/2  ms)@xmath150 erg ) dominates over the initial sn kinetic energy ( assumed to be 10@xmath15  erg ) .",
    "the @xcite models make an ansatz that the entire spindown energy of the magnetar is simply thermalized spherically at the base of the sn ejecta and deposited into the internal energy . because this process accelerates and heats the ejecta , the final kinetic energy , the peak luminosity , and the temperature",
    "are coupled .",
    "the model plotted in figure  [ boloplot ] predicts expansion velocities of @xmath925,000  km  s@xmath6 , in contradiction of the observed spectrum .",
    "in addition , the model predicts a radius at maximum light ( from the ejecta velocity and rise time ) that when combined with the luminosity implies a bb temperature in excess of @xmath151  k ( with strong evolution at other times ) .",
    "this contradicts the observed @xmath101  near maximum light and the constant red @xmath29@xmath48@xmath30  color during the rise of the light curve .",
    "we find that increasing the assumed sn kinetic energy relative to the spindown energy does not alleviate these issues because of the difficulty in simultaneously satisfying the constraints from the expansion velocity seen at maximum light ( which implies a normal energy - to - mass ratio , and hence high mass if the initial sn energy is high ) with the fast diffusion timescale ( which requires a low mass ) .",
    "the models of @xcite start from massive star progenitors and proceed through the explosions , but they only probe slower rotating , and hence less energetic , magnetars than those required for ps1 - 10afx .",
    "@xcite also examined explosion models for type ib / c sne with the addition of a central energy source that mimicked the effect of a magnetar .",
    "they followed the effects of a central energy source on the ejecta produced by the explosion models and generated light curves and spectra . if the central energy source deposited @xmath310@xmath15  erg of energy , the resulting sne had high velocities and were blue at maximum light , which appears promising for explaining the sn 2005ap - like class of slsne , but is very different from ps1 - 10afx .",
    "as noted above , the light curve of ps1 - 10afx  requires even more energy input from the magnetar .",
    "therefore , we disfavor magnetar models at this time .",
    "@xcite have proposed a scenario that shares some similarities with the magnetar model in that their model has a post - explosion internal energy source , in this case provided by fallback accretion onto a newly formed compact remnant , likely a black hole .",
    "their suite of models can only match the fast timescale and high peak luminosity of ps1 - 10afx  if the progenitor is a blue supergiant and the initial sn explosion energy is extremely low with an ejecta mass of @xmath31  m@xmath12 .",
    "their hydrogen - poor models do not reach the same peak luminosities , which is a problem for ps1 - 10afx .",
    "in addition , these models have the same problem as the magnetar ones in simultaneously satisfying the high peak luminosity and relatively cool photospheric temperature .      in all of the preceding discussion",
    ", we have necessarily assumed spherical symmetry in order to convert our observations into intrinsic quantities . however , core - collapse sne are all known to be aspherical at some level ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the most basic effect of asphericity is to increase the uncertainty in @xmath104  and dilute the connection between observables such as the rise time and physical quantities such as the diffusion timescale .",
    "the broad - lined sne ic associated with grbs have been extensively studied in the context of aspherical models , with different studies coming to conflicting conclusions for the same object ( e.g. , sn 1998bw : @xcite ) .",
    "the models of @xcite for sn 1998bw predict that lines of sight along the major axis of a bipolar outflow will see light curves with faster rise times and higher luminosities than average , perhaps indicating a general trend with relevance for ps1 - 10afx .",
    "however , despite the high explosion energies ( @xmath4910@xmath152  erg ) and fairly high nickel masses ( @xmath30.4 m@xmath12 ) assumed in their models , the maximum peak luminosity was still an order of magnitude lower than for ps1 - 10afx .",
    "in addition , the spectral features of ps1 - 10afx  are not as blended as those of broad - lined sne ic ( figure  [ uvcomp ] ) . we conclude that an aspherical sn 1998bw - like model is unlikely to produce an object that resembles ps1 - 10afx  unless some other ingredient is added to the models .    another possibility in a csm interaction scenario",
    "is that the material with which the sn is interacting is distributed in an aspherical fashion , perhaps allowing a distant observer to see both the luminous continuum emission from the interaction region and the sn ejecta .",
    "however , such models still require the combination of the covering fraction of the csm , the radiative efficiency factor , and the sn kinetic energy to be sufficiently high to produce the @xmath310@xmath15  erg of optical emission that we measure .",
    "the slsn models of @xcite invoke remnant protostellar disks around massive stars , but do not simultaneously fit the high peak luminosity and the fast timescale of ps1 - 10afx .",
    "in addition , such a model has similar difficulties as spherical csm interaction models in explaining the strength of the p - cygni features in the observed spectra if there is continuum emission from an interaction region that dilutes the strength of the spectral features from the ejecta .",
    "we now consider whether gravitational lensing could result in an object with the spectrum and light curve shape of a normal sn , but artificially boosted in luminosity .",
    "however , the peak luminosity of ps1 - 10afx  is a factor of @xmath950 higher than normal sne ic , requiring an extremely high magnification factor despite the lack of an obvious lens . while this work was being refereed , a preprint by @xcite expanded on this hypothesis further and proposed that ps1 - 10afx  was instead a normal sn ia and therefore had to be lensed by a magnification factor of @xmath320 .",
    "there are several constraints against the lensing hypothesis , starting with the lack of an apparent lens . in standard",
    "@xmath22cdm cosmologies , the optical depth to lensing with amplification factors @xmath4910 is very small , 10@xmath153 @xmath48 10@xmath154 for sources at the redshift of ps1 - 10afx   ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and the mass distribution of the lenses for those extreme magnifications is peaked at cluster - scale haloes of @xmath310@xmath148  m@xmath12  @xcite . however , there is no foreground galaxy cluster visible in the ps1 images , as @xcite also concluded on the basis of a clustering analysis of independent canada - france hawaii telescope images of the field .",
    "the source present along the line of sight to ps1 - 10afx  exhibits [ ] emission and the sed ( including a balmer break ) of a galaxy at the same redshift as the sn .",
    "the [ ] and rest - frame uv continuum luminosities produce similar estimates of the sfr .",
    "these observations are all consistent with the continuum flux from the source along the line of sight being dominated by , if not entirely due to , emission from the host galaxy of ps1 - 10afx , and leave little room for a contribution from a hypothetical lens galaxy at lower redshift",
    ". these constraints led @xcite to propose the existence of a dark lens from a previously unknown population , such as a free - floating black hole or a dark matter halo with few baryons .",
    "this provocative conclusion is based on the premise that ps1 - 10afx  has to be classified as a normal sn ia and therefore the intrinsic luminosity is known .",
    "we demonstrated above that the spectra of ps1 - 10afx  are similar to those of both sne ia and ic near maximum light ( section 4 ) .",
    "we also note that the presence of an absorption feature from @xmath636355 does not uniquely classify an object as a sn ia because that line is also present in some sne ic . as an experiment",
    ", we took near - maximum light spectra of an unambiguous nearby sne ic that exhibits features , sn 2004aw @xcite , resampled the data , and added noise to match the s / n of our ps1 - 10afx  fire data that show the possible absorption feature near 6100   .",
    "these noisy spectra were then run through the supernova identification ( snid ) code of @xcite , using the updated templates of @xcite , with care taken to exclude templates from the same object .",
    "we found that typically all of the top 20 best matching templates are sne ia .",
    "this is in part due to the biased sample of spectral templates used by sn classification codes , where sne ia are largely overrepresented .",
    "@xcite also claim that the light curve of ps1 - 10afx  is a good match for sne ia .",
    "however , we note that in order to get a good reduced-@xmath155 for their fit , they had to artificially increase the error bars in the nir and exclude the @xmath51-band data .",
    "furthermore , all of the ps1 - 10afx  observations prior to a phase of @xmath156  d fall below the sn ia prediction , including the @xmath30  non - detection at @xmath115  d that is @xmath30.7  mag below their model .",
    "this is a consequence of the fast rise time of ps1 - 10afx , which we measure above to be @xmath157  d if we assume that the rise scales as @xmath116 , and @xmath158  d if we relax that constraint .",
    "although spectroscopically normal sne ia show a small dispersion in their rise times , objects with normal light curve shapes have rise times of 16@xmath4818  d in @xmath159 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the rise in @xmath88 ( closer in rest wavelength to our @xmath30  observations ) was 2.3  d shorter , but still significantly longer than observed for ps1 - 10afx . at phases of @xmath160 to @xmath161  d , normal sne ia emit fluxes about 20@xmath4840% of the peak @xcite , but that is about 4@xmath134 above our non - detections ( figure  [ boloplot ] ) .    in summary , although sne ia have reasonably similar spectra and light curve shapes to ps1 - 10afx , the details of the rise time are not a good fit for sne ia and the spectra of the unambiguous sn ic 2004aw are also similar to sne ia when degraded to our low s / n ratio .",
    "therefore , an identification of ps1 - 10afx  with normal sne ia is not required by the data , and there is no need to invoke a new population of unseen dark gravitational lenses .",
    "instead , we accept the lack of an apparent lens at face value and conclude that ps1 - 10afx  was actually an unusually luminous hydrogen - deficient sn .",
    "we present multiwavelength observations of ps1 - 10afx  at redshift @xmath0 , perhaps the most luminous sn yet discovered . the combination of observables presents strict constraints on any theoretical interpretation .",
    "these are :    * a peak bolometric luminosity of 4.1@xmath410@xmath5  erg  s@xmath6 * an observed rise time of @xmath312  d * a fast light curve decay , with @xmath122@xmath123= @xmath162  mag * at least 7@xmath410@xmath126 erg of optical radiation emitted , with a total likely closer to 10@xmath15  erg * red color near maximum light ( @xmath163  k ) , although @xmath102 may be closer to @xmath99  k * constant uv color before maximum light * photospheric velocities near maximum light of @xmath3@xmath8  km  s@xmath6 * spectra that most closely resemble normal sne  ic , with deep p - cygni absorption * photometric and spectroscopic evidence for some line blanketing in the nuv from iron - peak elements , although not as much as for sne ia * a massive ( @xmath32@xmath410@xmath13  m@xmath12 ) host galaxy that is unlikely to have an extremely low metallicity    we surveyed existing models for slsne and found that none were acceptable . in particular , the large inferred @xmath128  near maximum light is very hard to reconcile with the fast observed rise time and the measured photospheric velocities because the sn ejecta need too much time to reach such large radii .",
    "the magnetar models that match the peak luminosity and rise time do so by producing a much higher temperature at a smaller radius .",
    "these flaws are generic to models powered by internal energy sources , although if the onset of the internal energy source can be sufficiently delayed after the initial explosion , then maybe the conflict between the velocities and radii can be avoided .",
    "shock breakout scenarios invoking dense csm provide a promising solution by allowing the sn to explode well before the optical emission is detectable .",
    "if the csm is sufficiently dense out to @xmath35@xmath410@xmath10  cm , then the light curve will only rise after the ejecta have had time to reach that radius . however , these models leave the normal sn ic - like spectrum unexplained and are in apparent conflict with the observed color evolution before maximum light . more detailed radiative transfer calculations of the models are necessary to know whether these flaws can be avoided .",
    "in addition , it is not clear how to produce the special csm structure that has to be assumed ( a truncated wind or a shell ) .",
    "ps1 - 10afx  was initially identified as an object of interest due to its unusual colors ( @xmath164 2  mag at peak ) and would not have been found without the ps1 observation strategy , which includes regular @xmath29  and @xmath30  observations as part of the search . at redshifts below @xmath31 , an object like ps1 - 10afx  would have a strong detection in @xmath28  and would not stand out without knowing the redshift .",
    "unlike many of the sn 2005ap - like sne , the time - dilated light curve of a ps1 - 10afx - like sn at lower redshift would not be unusually long and would not be associated with the attention - grabbing lack of a visible host galaxy . however , ps1 - 10afx  was more than a magnitude brighter than its host galaxy , which potentially provides a selection criterion to increase the odds of finding similar objects in the future . in the sample of slsne found by ps1 ,",
    "sn 2005ap - like objects @xcite outnumber ps1 - 10afx  by at least an order of magnitude . our poor understanding of spectroscopic incompleteness and the relevant selection effects precludes a more precise estimate of rates at this time .",

    "<S> we present the  discovery of ps1 - 10afx , a unique hydrogen - deficient superluminous supernova ( slsn ) at redshift @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the light curve peaked at @xmath1  mag , making ps1 - 10afx  comparable to the most luminous known sne , with @xmath2  mag . </S>",
    "<S> our extensive optical and near - infrared observations indicate that the bolometric light curve of ps1 - 10afx  rose on the unusually fast timescale of @xmath312  d to the extraordinary peak luminosity of 4.1@xmath410@xmath5 erg s@xmath6 ( @xmath7 mag ) and subsequently faded rapidly . equally important , the sed is unusually red for a slsn , with a color temperature of @xmath36800 k near maximum light , in contrast to previous hydrogen - poor slsne , which are bright in the ultraviolet ( uv ) . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra more closely resemble those of a normal sn ic than any known slsn , with a photospheric velocity of @xmath3@xmath8  km  s@xmath6  and evidence for line blanketing in the rest - frame uv . despite the fast rise </S>",
    "<S> , these parameters imply a very large emitting radius ( @xmath95@xmath410@xmath10 cm ) . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that no existing theoretical model can satisfactorily explain this combination of properties : ( i ) a nickel - powered light curve can not match the combination of high peak luminosity with the fast timescale ; ( ii ) models powered by the spindown energy of a rapidly - rotating magnetar predict significantly hotter and faster ejecta ; and ( iii ) models invoking shock breakout through a dense circumstellar medium can not explain the observed spectra or color evolution . </S>",
    "<S> the host galaxy is well detected in pre - explosion imaging with a luminosity near @xmath11 , a star formation rate of @xmath315 m@xmath12yr@xmath6 , and is fairly massive ( @xmath32@xmath410@xmath13  m@xmath12 ) , with a stellar population age of @xmath310@xmath14  yr , also in contrast to the young dwarf hosts of known hydrogen - poor slsne . </S>",
    "<S> ps1 - 10afx  is distinct from known examples of slsne in its spectra , colors , light - curve shape , and host galaxy properties , suggesting that it resulted from a different channel than other hydrogen - poor slsne . </S>"
