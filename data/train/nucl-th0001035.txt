    "the pwia picture breaks down , and the missing momentum and energy can not be readily interpreted as the initial momentum and removal energy of the outgoing nucleon . therefore , a quantitative understanding of fsi is needed in order to extract the information on the nucleon spectral function from the measured @xmath0 cross section . a wealth of highly accurate theoretical calculations of fsi effects in @xmath0 reactions",

    "it has to be emphasized , however , that fsi should not only be regarded as a _ noise _ , to be removed from the measured cross sections .",
    "in fact , in many instances fsi produce a _ signal _ that carries relevant information on both the target structure and the dynamics of the scattering process .",
    "for example , it has been shown that fsi effets , which obviously depend upon the distribution in space of the spectator particles , are very sensitive to the presence of local fluctuations of the nuclear density produced by nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) correlations .",

    "@xmath24 fsi effects in @xmath0 are expected to become vanishingly small .",
    "the possible signatures of the occurrence of ct in coincidence @xmath0 and @xmath25 processes have been recently studied within a theoretical many - body approach suitable for the calculation of semi - inclusive cross sections , involving a sum over the states of the undetected spectator system .",
