    "the quest for a unified theory of quarks and leptons is one of the main goals of beyond standard model physics . to this end",
    ", the unification of mixing angles of quarks and leptons , at a high scale , seems to be an exciting possibility . in the past",
    ", it has been investigated under the hypothesis referred to as ` high scale mixing unification ' ( hsmu ) for the case of majorana neutrinos @xcite and , recently , for the case of dirac neutrinos @xcite .",
    "a similar possibility has also been investigated in @xcite . within the hsmu hypothesis ,",
    "the observed values of oscillation parameters at low energies are obtained through the renormalization group ( rg ) evolution of these parameters from the unification scale ( high scale ) to the low scale @xmath3 ( mass of the z boson ) .",
    "in addition , the hsmu hypothesis also provides hints about the type and nature of the underlying unified theory that might exist at the unification scale .",
    "one of the key predictions of the hsmu hypothesis is the small non - zero value of @xmath4 @xcite . at the time of the earlier work on hsmu , only an upper bound on @xmath4 existed and",
    "it was not known whether @xmath4 was zero or non - zero .",
    "the recent results from different experiments have established the value of @xmath4 to be non - zero @xcite .",
    "this precise measurement can be used to test predictions of various models and put stringent constraints on them .",
    "the current global scenario of the neutrino oscillation parameters ( for normal hierarchy pattern ) @xcite is summarized in the table [ tab1 ] . since @xmath4 is fairly well determined now , it is important to check whether hsmu is consistent with this measurement .",
    "[ tab1 ]    .the global fits for neutrino oscillation parameters @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab2 ]    in table [ tab2 ] , we present five sets of neutrino oscillation parameters at low and high energy scales obtained within hsmu hypothesis .",
    "each column in the table depicts some specific set of values for neutrino oscillation parameters chosen in a way to show correlations between them . in order to highlight the correlation between any two low scale parameters we choose the unification scale neutrino masses such that all other parameters , at the low scale , remain close to their best fit values and @xmath1",
    "is correlated in the hsmu hypothesis .",
    "therefore , at the low scale , both can not be obtained near their best fit values simultaneously . ] . in column",
    "i , all the low scale parameters are obtained close to their best fit values , except @xmath1 which is @xmath5 . in column ii , keeping @xmath4 and @xmath6 close to their best fit values at the low scale , the values of @xmath7 and @xmath8 are obtained at their 3-@xmath9 upper and lower edge respectively . for this pattern , @xmath1 again turns out to be @xmath5 , i.e. non - maximal . whereas , in column iii , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are respectively kept at their 3-@xmath9 lower and upper edge .",
    "the rest of the results are similar to the previous ones . in columns iv and v , @xmath6 is taken to its lower and upper 3-@xmath9 limit , respectively , keeping all other parameters ( except @xmath1 ) close to their best fit values at the low scale .",
    "we see that @xmath1 always remains above @xmath10 and lies in the second octant . moreover , as is clear from table [ tab2 ] , for a fixed value of @xmath4 , the correlation between @xmath6 and @xmath1 is weak .",
    "the rg evolution of the three pmns and ckm mixing angles from the unification scale ( @xmath11 gev ) to the low scale @xmath12 is shown in figure [ fig1 ] . as clear from the figure , owing to the quasi - degeneracy of neutrino masses , large angle magnification occurs in the pmns sector .",
    "the magnification of ckm mixing angles @xmath13 is almost negligible because of the hierarchical nature of quark masses .",
    "we also observe that the major part of magnification occurs near susy breaking scale which , in this case , is chosen to be @xmath14 gev .",
    "the sm rg equations lead to negligible angle magnification as clear from the flatness of curves below @xmath15 .    the rg evolution of neutrino masses from unification scale to @xmath3 is shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "it is clear that all the masses decrease as we move from unification scale to low scale ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "initially , at unification scale , the splitting among the masses is relatively large but after rg evolution the splitting gets narrowed down and they acquire nearly degenerate mass at @xmath3 .",
    "it is evident from table [ tab2 ] that only one ( i.e. @xmath16 ) out of two mass squared differences , at the low scale , lies within experimental 3-@xmath9 range .",
    "this discrepancy can easily be accounted for by threshold corrections @xcite . in the case of quasi - degenerate neutrinos ,",
    "the low energy mssm threshold corrections can result in a significant contribution , as shown in @xcite .",
    "these threshold corrections are given by following equations @xcite : @xmath17 , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "( \\delta m_{32}^2)_{th } & = & 2\\rm m^2\\sin^2\\theta_{12}[-2t_e + t_\\mu + t_\\tau ] , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "( \\delta m_{31}^2)_{th } & = & 2\\rm m^2\\cos^2\\theta_{12}[-2t_e + t_\\mu + t_\\tau].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath18 is the mean mass of the quasi - degenerate neutrinos and @xmath19 is the one - loop factor . its form has been previously calculated in @xcite and given by @xmath20 , \\label{eq23}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath21 is the @xmath22 coupling constant and @xmath23 with @xmath24 ; @xmath25 stands for wino mass , @xmath26 represents the mass of charged sleptons .",
    "moreover , without any loss of generality , the loop - factor has been defined to give @xmath27 ( cf .",
    "@xcite for details ) .    at the lhc , for simplified scenarios ,",
    "chargino masses are excluded up to @xmath28 gev in the presence of light sleptons and up to @xmath29 gev in the case of heavy sleptons @xcite . in the view of above constraints , here",
    "we have taken the wino mass to be @xmath30 gev .",
    "after the inclusion of threshold corrections , along with the rg - evolution effects , the final expression for mass squared differences is given as    @xmath31    it is clear from table [ tab2 ] , that the rg effects , along with threshold corrections , result in good agreement between the predictions of hsmu hypothesis and the present experimentally allowed range of neutrino oscillation parameters ( cf .",
    "table [ tab1 ] ) . at this juncture",
    ", we would like to point out that , although the threshold corrections for mass square differences are significant yet they are negligibly small compare to the mean mass of neutrinos .",
    "the same is also true for the threshold corrections to mixing angles @xcite .",
    "within the framework of the hsmu hypothesis , the low energy oscillation data can be used to put stringent constraints on the allowed parameter range for the neutrino masses and mixing angle .",
    "the aim of this section is to discuss the predictions from our analysis which are obtained after imposing these constraints .",
    "these predictions can be tested in present and future experiments as discussed in this section .      as clear from table",
    "[ tab2 ] , the neutrino masses at @xmath3 lie in the range of @xmath34-@xmath35 ev .",
    "this range can be probed by various presently running as well as near future experiments and hence it provides an important test for hsmu hypothesis .",
    "for example , the recent result from gerda gives an upper bound of @xmath36-@xmath37 ev on the @xmath33 component of mass matrix @xcite .",
    "similarly , exo-200 provides an upper bound of @xmath38-@xmath35 ev on the same @xcite .",
    "although the present bounds on @xmath32 from tritium beta decay are comparatively weak ( @xmath39 2 ev ) @xcite . in future , the katrin experiment will be able to probe it down to 0.2 ev @xcite .    moreover , the recent planck data has provided a bound on the sum of neutrino masses in the range of @xmath40-@xmath41 ev depending on the choice of the priors @xcite .",
    "the lower limit of planck is in tension with our hypothesis but it should be noted that the cosmological constraints are highly model dependent and should be taken in conjunction with other experiments . in view of the above considerations , the absolute value of neutrino masses provides an important test of our hypothesis .",
    "we would like to point out that the above mentioned mass range ( @xmath34-@xmath35 ev ) is obtained for a specific choice of unification scale , susy breaking scale and @xmath2 ( cf .",
    "table [ tab2 ] for details ) .",
    "the dependence of neutrino masses ( at @xmath3 ) with respect to these parameters is discussed , in detail , in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "it is clear from the rg equations ( [ thetarg ] ) that , within hsmu hypothesis , the mixing angles @xmath4 and @xmath1 are correlated . in figure",
    "[ fig3 ] , we show the explicit dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath4 keeping other low scale neutrino oscillation parameters fixed near to their best fit values .",
    "we observe that @xmath1 turns out to be above @xmath10 ( i.e. lies in the second octant ) , for the whole 3-@xmath9 range of @xmath4 .",
    "this prediction is easily testable in the current and in future experimets , like ino , t2k , no@xmath42a , lbne , hyper - k and pingu @xcite .    even for the lower edge value of the present 3-@xmath9 range of @xmath4 ,",
    "the value of @xmath1 is non - maximal and is around @xmath43 , as evident from figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "the values of @xmath1 increase with @xmath4 .",
    "when @xmath4 is around @xmath44 , @xmath1 reaches its upper edge of 3-@xmath9 limit and it goes into the disfavored region for higher values of @xmath4 ( which is still within its 3-@xmath9 range ) .",
    "this , in turn , puts constraints on the values of @xmath4 , which should lie in the range @xmath45-@xmath46 , @xmath1 also depends very weakly on @xmath6 .",
    "the above quoted range is for @xmath6 at its best fit value . ] .    at this point",
    "we would like to mention that , the rg evolution of @xmath6 also depends on @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , it can be varied independently of the other two angles by making an appropriate choice of @xmath47 at unification scale .",
    "hence , within hsmu hypothesis , no effective constraints on its range can be obtained .",
    "in this section , we study the variation of unification scale , susy breaking scale and @xmath2 and its impact on hsmu hypothesis . we derive constraints on the range of these parameters for which hsmu hypothesis works . for this purpose , in this section , we have fixed the values of experimentally measured quantities @xmath6 and @xmath4 to their best fit values ( i.e. @xmath49 and @xmath50 respectively ) at @xmath3 .",
    "we also fix @xmath51 , which is slightly higher than its best fit value , so that after adding appropriate threshold corrections , it remains within 3-@xmath9 range .",
    "since in our hypothesis the quantities @xmath1 and @xmath52 are fixed in terms of other quantities , we have not put any restrictions on them , apart from the fact that , after adding appropriate threshold corrections they should remain within 3-@xmath9 limit .      in the previous sections",
    ", we have chosen our unification scale as @xmath11 gev which is the typical scale for guts . since our hypothesis",
    "does not depend on the details of the high scale theory , it is not necessary to take the unification scale to be same as that of gut .",
    "thus , in this subsection , we analyze the effect of variation of unification scale .",
    "it is clear from figure [ fig1 ] , that a major part of angle magnification happens only close to @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , it is expected that the desired angle magnification can be achieved even when the unification scale is not same as the gut scale . in figure [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] ,",
    "we have , respectively , shown the variation of unification scale with respect to high and low scale neutrino masses . the magnitude of low scale masses ( and derived quantities such as @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) put constraints ) and @xmath33 are almost the same .",
    "hence , in drawing the constraints in figures [ fig5 ] , [ fig7 ] and [ fig9 ] we have neglected the small difference in the exact values of @xmath53 and @xmath33 . ] on the unification scale as evident from the figure [ fig5 ] and further elaborated in section [ subsec44 ] .",
    "our analysis works for a wide range of unification scale from the planck scale to much lower scales ( cf .",
    "figures [ fig4 ] , [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "the reason for this is that the major part of magnification of angles happens in a relatively small range near @xmath15 .",
    "hence , one can take the unification scale to be several orders of magnitude lower than the gut scale and still achieve desired magnification at @xmath3 .",
    "the noteworthy point is that as we lower the unification scale the input neutrino masses have to be taken more degenerate because the range of mssm rg running becomes shorter ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "thus , to achieve desired magnifications at @xmath3 , one has to make the input neutrino masses more degenerate to account for the lesser range of mssm rg running .",
    "this increasing degeneracy of masses , in turn , results in @xmath54 approaching its 3-@xmath9 range much before @xmath3 . therefore , to counter this and to keep @xmath54 within its 3-@xmath9 range at @xmath3 , one is also forced to increase the mean input mass at unification scale .",
    "furthermore , once the input mean mass is increased , it results in a relative increase in the mean mass at @xmath3 , partly because now it is higher to begin with and partly because of the small range of mssm rg running .",
    "thus , the mean mass of neutrinos at unification scale as well as at @xmath3 increases as we decrease the unification scale .",
    "hence , one can constrain the lowest possible unification scale using data from various experiments .",
    "we will further elaborate on such experimental constraints in section [ subsec44 ] .",
    "we have , so far , fixed the susy breaking scale at @xmath55 gev . in this section ,",
    "we analyze the effects of variation of susy breaking scale .",
    "it is clear from figure [ fig1 ] that the major part of magnification occurs only in and around the susy breaking scale .",
    "so one should expect to shift the scale of susy breaking from the so far chosen value and still be able to achieve the desired magnification .",
    "our analysis works for a wide range of susy breaking scale starting from the tev scale to much higher scales ( as is clear from figures [ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] ) . while plotting these figures , we have taken the unification scale @xmath56 gev , @xmath57 and the value of observables at @xmath3 to be same as before .",
    "as we increase the susy breaking scale , the input neutrino masses have to be taken to be more degenerate .",
    "the reason for this is that by increasing the susy breaking scale the range of mssm rg running becomes shorter .",
    "thus , to achieve desired magnifications at @xmath3 one has to make the input neutrino masses more degenerate in order to counter the lesser range of mssm rg running . at the same time , we have to increase the mean mass of neutrinos at unification scale in order to keep the @xmath54 within its 3-@xmath9 range at @xmath3 .",
    "since the mean mass of the neutrinos increases with increasing susy breaking scale , one can constrain the highest possible susy breaking scale using data from various experiments . moreover , the lower ranges of susy breaking scale are constrained from susy searches at the lhc @xcite .",
    "we further discuss these constraints in the section [ subsec44 ] .      in mssm ,",
    "the rg running of angles gets enhanced by a factor of @xmath58 [ cf .",
    "( [ thetarg ] ) for details ] .",
    "therefore , the larger values of @xmath59 enhance the magnification at @xmath3 .",
    "this is the reason for choosing @xmath60 in the previous sections of this work .",
    "we have , so far , fixed @xmath61 but in this section we will vary @xmath48 to obtain the lower limits on it for desired magnification .",
    "+    it is clear from figures [ fig8 ] and [ fig9 ] that the mixing angle magnification happens for a wide range of @xmath48 .",
    "although we have not shown this in the figure , the desired angle magnifications can be obtained for values of @xmath48 as low as 4 or 5 .",
    "but , for low @xmath2 the masses of neutrinos become very high at low scale .",
    "furthermore , if we take low values of @xmath48 , the input neutrino masses , at unification scale , have to be taken more degenerate and the mean mass should also be higher .",
    "the reason is that with decreasing @xmath48 the factor @xmath58 becomes small .",
    "thus , to achieve desired magnifications at @xmath3 one has to make the input neutrino masses more degenerate to account for the smaller contribution coming from @xmath58 term . at the same time to keep @xmath54 within its 3-@xmath9 range at @xmath3 ,",
    "one is forced to increase the mean input mass at unification scale . since the mean mass of the neutrinos increases with decreasing @xmath48",
    ", one can constrain the range of allowed @xmath2 from various experiments , as discussed in section [ subsec44 ] .      as is clear from previous discussion ,",
    "the mean mass of neutrinos varies with the variation of the unification scale , susy breaking scale and @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , one can constrain the range of these parameters by using data from various experiments , as discussed below .",
    "\\(i ) _ constraints from tritium beta decay : _ the present constraints on @xmath62 coming from tritium beta decay are @xmath63 ev @xcite . they give only the upper bound on the masses of the neutrinos and thus the whole mass range of the figures [ fig5 ] , [ fig7 ] and [ fig9 ] easily comes under this limit .",
    "hence , the tritium beta decay constraints are relatively weak .",
    "they allow much lower values of the unification scale , @xmath2 and much higher values of susy breaking scale than those plotted in the above figures .",
    "however , in future , the katrin experiment is expected to probe @xmath62 as low as 0.2 ev @xcite and hence will be able to put much tighter constraints on the allowed range of these parameters .",
    "\\(ii ) _ constraints from neutrinoless double beta decay _ : at present , the exo-200 and gerda experiments provide the most stringent constraints on @xmath64 .",
    "the latest results from phase i of the gerda experiment have given the upper limit on @xmath65 to be 0.20 - 0.40 ev @xcite , whereas exo-200 has given an upper limit of 0.14 - 0.38 ev @xcite .",
    "this , in turn , puts stringent constraints on the allowed range of various parameters , as given below .",
    "\\(a ) the lower limit of unification scale is constrained to be around @xmath66 gev by gerda and around @xmath67 gev by ex0 - 200 ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "\\(b ) the results from gerda constrains the highest possible susy breaking scale to be around @xmath68 gev , whereas exo-200 puts a limit of around @xmath69 gev ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "\\(c ) the lowest possible value of @xmath48 is constrained to be around 50 ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig9 ] ) .    in future",
    ", these limits are expected to improve , thus resulting in more tighter constraints e.g. the gerda phase ii is aiming for an increased sensitivity by a factor of about 10 ( cf .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "it should be noted that the above constraints are for the case when all the pmns phases are taken to be zero .",
    "these constraints are likely to change in the presence of phases .",
    "we will analyze them , in detail , in our next work @xcite .",
    "\\(iii ) _ cosmological constraints : _ the recent result of the planck collaboration has given constraints on the sum of neutrino masses to be in the range of 0.23 ev [ 95% ; planck+wp+highl+bao ] to 1.08 ev [ 95% ; planck+wp+highl ( @xmath70 ) ] depending on values chosen for the priors @xcite .",
    "the limit of 1.08 ev implies that the mean neutrino mass has to be around 0.36 ev , thus putting similar constraints to those obtained from @xmath65 .",
    "the lowest value ( i.e. 0.23 ev [ 95% ; planck+wp+highl+bao ] ) is in tension with our hypothesis .",
    "however , as noted by the planck collaboration itself , the cosmological limits are highly dependent on chosen values of priors , so these limits should be taken as indicative and not conclusive .",
    "to conclude , in view of the above experimental constraints , for fixed values of other parameters , ( 1 ) the unification scale should be taken around @xmath67 gev or above , ( 2 ) the susy breaking scale should be taken below @xmath69 gev and ( 3 ) the @xmath59 should be taken above 50 .",
    "we have investigated the implications of high scale mixing unification hypothesis in the wake of new data and experimental constraints .",
    "this hypothesis leads to the experimentally observed mixing angles and mass square differences at low energy scales ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the small but non - zero value of @xmath4 is a natural outcome of this hypothesis which has been recently confirmed by various experiments @xcite .",
    "we found that , in absence of phases , for the present 3-@xmath9 range of @xmath4 hsmu hypothesis uniquely predicts the value of @xmath1 to be non - maximal and above @xmath10 .",
    "the normal hierarchy and quasi - degeneracy of neutrino masses are essential assumptions to realize hsmu hypothesis .",
    "we have also analyzed the allowed parameter range for other parameters of our hypothesis _ vis - a - vis _ various experimental constraints .",
    "we found that ( i ) the unification scale should be above @xmath71 gev , ( ii ) the susy breaking scale should lie below @xmath69 gev , and ( iii ) the value of @xmath48 should be taken above 50 .",
    "however , it should be noted that all the above conclusions have been drawn by taking dirac as well as majorana phases of pmns matrix to be zero .",
    "these conclusions may change in the presence of phases .",
    "the detailed implications of these phases are under investigation and will be reported in our future publications @xcite .    moreover , in a recent analysis of the hsmu hypothesis with dirac type neutrinos",
    ", we have found similar predictions for mixing angles @xcite . at the end",

    "<S> we investigate the renormalization group evolution of masses and mixing angles of majorana neutrinos under the ` high scale mixing unification ' hypothesis . assuming the unification of quark - lepton mixing angles at a high scale , we show that all the experimentally observed neutrino oscillation parameters can be obtained , within 3-@xmath0 range , through the running of corresponding renormalization group equations provided neutrinos have same cp parity and are quasi - degenerate . </S>",
    "<S> one of the novel results of our analysis is that @xmath1 turns out to be non - maximal and lies in the second octant . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we derive new constraints on the allowed parameter space for the unification scale , susy breaking scale and @xmath2 , for which the ` high scale mixing unification ' hypothesis works . </S>"
