    "orbiting around the milky way , there is a large number of satellite galaxies , most of which have so low average surface brightnesses and small effective radii that their detection was very difficult in the past : from 1937 up to 1994 , only nine of them were discovered and that number remained unchanged until 2005 .",
    "they are the so - called _ classical dwarf spheroidal galaxies _",
    "( dsphs ) , which are among the least luminous and most dark matter ( dm ) dominated galaxies which are observed today in the universe .",
    "dwarf spheroidal galaxies are classified as early - type since they are observed to possess very low gas mass at the present time and their stars are very iron - poor when compared to the sun ( see @xcite and @xcite for an exhaustive review ) .",
    "color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) fitting analysis revealed star formation rate ( sfr ) in dsphs to have been either continuous for a long time or occurring in bursts . all dsph galaxies host an underlying very old stellar population with age @xmath3 gyr ( e.g. @xcite ) , and some of them are dominated by an intermediate - age stellar population with age in the range @xmath4 gyr @xcite .",
    "very few dsphs have been observed to host younger stars , which populate the so - called `` blue plume '' in the cmd , sign of a relatively recent star formation activity , which occurred up to @xmath5 gyr ago @xcite .",
    "all such features led cosmologists to hypothesize dsphs to be the evolved small progenitor systems which merged in the past to form the actual large structures in the universe as the stellar halo of the milky way , in the framework of the @xmath6cdm standard cosmological model @xcite . however , successive deeper investigations revealed them not to possess all the right properties to be the aforementioned hypothetical survived progenitors of the galactic halo ( see @xcite and @xcite and references therein ) .    the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) allowed in the past few years ( from 2005 up to the present time ) to discover a large number of new dwarf galaxies orbiting around the milky way with physical properties very similar to dsph galaxies but average surface brightnesses and effective radii even much smaller ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) :",
    "for such reasons , they have been named as _ ultra - faint dwarf spheroidal galaxies _",
    "( ufds ) . that is a mere naming convention , without any real physical motivation , since ufds",
    "extend to fainter magnitudes and lower masses the same observed physical properties of dsphs .",
    "in fact ufd galaxies do not contain any gas at the present time and their stars are on average very iron - poor , with age @xmath7 gyr @xcite .",
    "so ufds do not show any recent star formation activity .",
    "such stellar systems soon aroused great interest in the scientific community , either for their extreme observed characteristics , or because such characteristics might shed light on the conditions of the universe in the first billion years of its evolution ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "the ufd environment constitutes the best candidate for verifying whether a first population of very massive and extremely metal - poor stars ( the so - called population iii ) might have existed or not .",
    "such stars , at their death , should have enriched the interstellar medium ( ism ) with some metals and therefore they might have left a chemical signature in the stars which were born immediately after , as some of the ufd stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "as @xcite had envisaged , this hypothesis might be supported by the observation of carbon - enhanced metal - poor ( cemp ) stars in some ufd galaxies @xcite , which might be directly linked to the cemp - damped ly-@xmath8 systems observed in the spectra of quasars at high redshift @xcite . in this scenario , the latter might be the high - redshift unevolved counterparts of some of the ufd galaxies .",
    "aim of this work is to study how dsph and ufd galaxies have evolved , by reconstructing - going back in time - the chemical enrichment history of their ism , starting from the chemical abundances derived today in the atmospheres of their stars .",
    "we will adopt a detailed chemical evolution model which is able to follow the evolution of several chemical species ( h , he , c , n , o , @xmath8-elements , fe - peak elements , s- and r- process elements ) .",
    "this model is based on that presented by @xcite and then used also in the works of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "@xcite modeled the chemical evolution of six dsphs of the local group including sextans , sculptor , sagittarius , draco , ursa minor and carina .",
    "their main conclusions were that dsphs suffered from very low star formation efficiency , which caused the iron pollution from type ia sne to become important when the @xmath1 $ ] of galaxy ism was still very low . in this manner , and by assuming also intense galactic winds , they were able to explain the observed decrease in the trends of @xmath0 $ ] vs. @xmath1 $ ] .",
    "galactic winds prevent the galaxy to form stars soon after the onset of the outflow and this leads the stellar metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) in dsphs to be peaked towards low @xmath1 $ ] abundances , almost @xmath9 dex below the one of milky way disc in the solar neighborhood , in agreement with observations .    as interesting papers appeared recently , @xcite modeled the chemical evolution of sculptor by means of a new approach in a full cosmological framework , whereas @xcite present a first chemical evolution model of the hercules ufd , based on the same numerical code we use in this work .",
    "here we focus on the chemical evolution of sculptor and carina , for which newer data are available , but especially we model the evolution of ufds : hercules and botes i. in section [ section2 ] we describe the adopted chemical evolution model . in section [ section3 ]",
    "the data sample is presented and in section [ section4 ] the results are shown . finally , in section [ section5 ] some conclusions are drawn .",
    "we assumed dsph and ufd galaxies to form by infall of primordial gas in a pre - existing dm halo .",
    "the infall rate obeys to a decaying exponential law with very short typical time - scales and the so - called _ infall mass _ represents the reservoir of the infalling gas from which the stars form .    thanks to the detailed treatment of the main physical processes involved in the chemical enrichment of the galaxy ism , we were able to predict the trends of the chemical abundances of many elements relative to iron as a function of @xmath1$]=\\log_{10}(n_{x}/n_{y})_{\\star}-\\log_{10}(n_{x}/n_{y})_{\\odot}$ ] , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the volume density number of the atoms of the species @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively .",
    "] , the mdf and the total stellar and gas masses at the present time .",
    "other observational constraints are represented by the history of star formation ( sfh ) , which may be characterized either by a single long episode or by several bursts of star formation , according to the cmd - fitting analysis ; the total mass of the dm halo and , finally , the effective radius of the luminous baryonic component of the galaxy .",
    "we assumed , when we do not have any information , a diffuse dark matter halo for these galaxies , with @xmath14 between @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 represents the core radius of each galaxy dm halo .",
    "the main assumptions of the model , which is similar to that of @xcite , are the following :    1 .",
    "each galaxy is modelled as a one zone with instantaneous and complete mixing of gas within it ; 2 .",
    "stellar lifetimes are taken into account ( no instantaneous recycling approximation ) ; 3 .",
    "nucleosynthesis prescriptions include the yields of @xcite for type ia sne , the yields of @xcite ( with the corrections suggested by @xcite ) for massive stars , and the metallicity - dependent yields of @xcite for low and intermediate mass stars .",
    "the galaxy can lose gas through galactic winds , which develop when the thermal energy of the gas @xmath18 equals the binding energy of the gas @xmath19 .",
    "the latter quantity @xmath19 is calculated by means of assumptions concerning the presence and the distribution of the dm which , for dsphs and ufds , is usually represented as a diffuse halo ( see @xcite ) , whereas the thermal energy of gas @xmath18 is primarily determined by the energy deposited by sn explosions into the ism ( see also for more details @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "if @xmath20 is the gas mass in the form of an element @xmath21 at the time @xmath22 within the ism , its temporal evolution is described by the following basic equation : @xmath23 where the quantity @xmath24 represents the abundance by mass of the element @xmath21 , with the summation over the abundances of all the elements in the gas mixture being equal to unity , and @xmath25 is the total gas mass of the galaxy at the time @xmath22 .",
    "the functions @xmath26 and @xmath27 represent the initial mass function ( imf ) and the star formation rate ( sfr ) , respectively .    1 .   the first term in the right hand side of eq.([eq : dsph ] ) represents the rate at which chemical elements are subtracted from the ism by star formation activity .",
    "the sfr has the following simple form ( schmidt law with @xmath28 , @xcite ) : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the star formation efficiency ( @xmath31=gyr^{-1}$ ] ) , which represents the intensity of the star formation rate and we assume in this work @xmath28 .",
    "the inverse of @xmath30 corresponds to the typical time - scale for the complete gas consumption if star formation were the only physical process affecting the ism .",
    "2 .   the second term in eq.([eq : dsph ] ) , @xmath32 , represents the returned mass in the form of an element @xmath21 that stars eject into the ism per unit time through stellar winds and supernova explosions .",
    "this term contains all the prescriptions concerning stellar yields and supernova progenitor models .",
    "the third term in eq.([eq : dsph ] ) , @xmath33 , is the rate at which the element @xmath21 is accreted during the initial infall event .",
    "the rate of gas infall is defined as : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a suitable constant such that @xmath36 with @xmath37 being the infall mass and @xmath38 the so - called infall time - scale of the mass accretion .",
    "the gas out of which dsph and ufd galaxies form is assumed to be of primordial chemical composition , namely @xmath39 for heavy elements .",
    "we assumed for dsphs an infall time - scale @xmath40 gyr , while for ufds we adopted @xmath41 gyr , which is almost equivalent to assume the gas to be all present in the dm halo since the beginning .",
    "the reason for these choices will be clearer in the next sections and are dictated by fitting the observational constraints .",
    "the last term in eq.([eq : dsph ] ) represents the rate at which the element @xmath21 is lost through galactic winds . for each element @xmath21 ,",
    "the rate of gas loss at the time @xmath22 is assumed to be directly proportional to the sfr at the time @xmath22 : @xmath42 where @xmath43 are free parameters describing the efficiency of the galactic wind , i.e. the intensity of the rate of gas loss in the form of the element @xmath21 .",
    "here is all the information regarding the energy released by sne , as well the efficiency with which that energy is transformed into gas escape velocity . for dsph and ufd galaxies we supposed the galactic wind to be _ normal",
    "_ , namely with the @xmath44 parameter being equal for all the chemical elements , although we tested also models with different kind of _ differential _ winds , following @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in general , we have selected - when possible - only high - resolution data and we have scaled all of them to the same solar abundances @xcite .",
    "the reason for this was to homogeneize the data as much as possible .",

    "hercules appears clearly highly elongated , without any evidence of internal rotation ( @xmath51 km s@xmath52 , from @xcite ) .",

    "we need these quantities in order to compute the binding energy of the gas and so the time at which the galaxy developed the galactic wind .",
    "the complete set of the parameters characterizing the chemical evolution models performed for the sculptor dsph is summarized in table [ sculptorinput ] .",
    "we changed the values of @xmath30 ( efficiency of star formation ) and @xmath44 ( wind parameter ) , in order to find a model able to reproduce the observed properties of the galaxy , such as the abundance ratios , the mdf and the present time gas and stellar masses .",
    "we tried models with @xmath133 and @xmath134 ; then , for each value of @xmath44 , we varied the star formation efficiency @xmath30 , setting it at the following values : @xmath135 and @xmath136 .    in fig.([sculptorsfr ] ) we show the trend of the predicted sfr as a function of time . by looking at this figure , in the earliest stages of the galaxy evolution ,",
    "the sfr increases very steeply because of the large amount of pristine gas accreted during the infall in a very short time - scale .",
    "in fact , we have assumed the sfr , @xmath27 , to be proportional to the gas mass ( see eq.([sfr ] ) ) .",
    "after the majority of the reservoir of gas @xmath37 has been accreted , the star formation begins to decrease in time , since both sf activity and galactic wind subtract gas from the galaxy ism .    in fig.([sculptorsnr ] ) we compare the predicted type ii and type ia supernova rates .",
    "while sne ia occur on a large range of time - scales ( from @xmath137 myr up to the age of the universe ) , depending on the features of the progenitor system , the type ii sn rate traces very closely the trend of the sfr , because of the very short typical time - scales involved ( from @xmath138 up to @xmath137 myr ) .",
    "thus , after the infall is substantially reduced , the type ii sn rate decreases much more steeply than the type ia sn rate .",
    "we predict a present time snia rate of @xmath139 , where @xmath140 represents the rate with units of one sn per @xmath141 per @xmath142 stellar mass @xcite .",
    "for each of the models we have calculated , tab.([sculptortable ] ) reports its main predictions regarding the stellar and gas masses at the present time , the time of onset of the galactic wind , and the @xmath1$]-peak of the stellar mdf . in the first two columns , tab.([sculptortable ] ) shows again the input parameters ( @xmath30 and @xmath44 ) characterizing each model .        by looking at tab.([sculptortable ] ) , for a fixed value of the wind parameter @xmath44 , models with increasing star formation efficiencies predict slightly larger final total stellar masses and , at the same time , slightly lower final total gas masses .",
    "this happens both because star formation is more efficient , and because the galactic wind is predicted to start earlier and earlier , being larger the number of sn events triggering the wind .",
    "the wind parameter @xmath44 - which roughly represents the efficiency with which the chemical elements are carried out of the galaxy - characterizes the intensity of the outflow rate . by increasing the wind parameter @xmath44",
    ", our models predict the final total gas mass to be lower , since the galactic wind removes the interstellar gas from the galaxy potential well more efficiently .",
    "moreover , as one would expect , the final total stellar mass slightly decreases if the efficiency of the galactic wind is strengthened",
    ".     models .",
    "the observed dataset comes from @xcite , who combined the data samples of the dart project @xcite and of @xcite . by enhancing the star formation efficiency , the peak of the mdf shift towards higher @xmath1 $ ] abundance ratios , because of the shorter time - scales involved in the chemical enrichment of the ism . at the same time , the height of the peak diminishes , because of the stronger outflow rates ( @xmath143 ) , which clean up the galaxy of the gas ; that is more evident by passing from @xmath144 up to @xmath145 .",
    "the best agreement is obtained with the @xmath127 gyr@xmath52 and @xmath94 model .",
    ", width=340 ]    all the models at tab.([sculptortable ] ) predict final stellar masses which are of the same order of magnitude as the observed one @xmath146 , which has been derived by @xcite by integrating the sfr up to the present time ; however , this mass is still quite uncertain , since it strongly depends not only on the imf adopted , but also on the overall cmd - fitting technique .",
    "moreover , all the models predict very low final gas masses ( @xmath147 ) , which are lower than @xmath148 estimated by @xcite and very much lower than the most recent estimate of @xcite , which inferred for sculptor an upper limit in the hi mass of @xmath149 , although affected by a very large uncertainty .    finally , from tab.([sculptortable ] ) , it is possible to appreciate the net effect of changing the star formation efficiency @xmath30 and the wind parameter @xmath44 on the mdf - peak .",
    "the lowest @xmath1 $ ] at which the mdf has its peak is obtained by the models with the lowest @xmath30 and the highest @xmath44 .",
    "as already mentioned , the @xmath8-elements are mainly produced by type ii sne , on short time - scales , whereas the bulk of iron and iron - peak elements ( @xmath150 of the total ) are produced by type ia sne on a very large range of typical time - scales .",
    "the residual quantities of iron and iron - peak elements ( @xmath151 of the total ) are synthesized by type ii sne .",
    "different typical star formation time - scales can affect the @xmath0 $ ] vs. @xmath1 $ ] diagram with a typical signature @xcite .",
    "in fact , low star formation efficiencies cause the amount of iron from type ii sne to grow very slowly within the ism .",
    "as the first type ia sne start to explode , they deposit a large quantity of iron into the ism and the @xmath0 $ ] ratio is expected to steeply decrease at still very low @xmath1 $ ] .",
    "conversely , high star formation efficiencies give rise to large fractions of iron produced by type ii sne . in this case , a plateau in the @xmath0 $ ] vs. @xmath1 $ ] diagram is predicted and the decrease occurs at relatively high @xmath1 $ ] abundances ( see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the abundance ratios in dsph reflect their low sfr @xcite . in fig.([alphasculptoromega10 ] ) we show the effect of different @xmath30 values on the predicted @xmath0 $ ] vs. @xmath1 $ ] relations .",
    "to lower further the sfr and thus steepening even more the decrease in the @xmath0 $ ] vs. @xmath1 $ ] , one can adopt higher values of the wind parameter @xmath44 .",
    "in fact , the galactic wind subtracts gas to the sf and makes it to decrease . in the models of fig.([alphasculptoromega10 ] ) , we assumed the outflow to remove all the chemical elements with the same efficiency , i.e. with same @xmath44 parameter .",
    "we note that in fig.([alphasculptoromega10 ] ) the data relative to mg lie below our model predictions .",
    "the reason for this can be uncertainties in the data or more likely uncertainties in the mg yields .",
    "these anomalous low - mg stars have been often associated with inhomogeneous enrichment on small scales from , e.g. , single or at least few sne @xcite . however , in small systems we should expect that different regions of the ism mix on small typical timescales and , if the star formation timescales are large enough ( and this is the case for dsphs and ufds ) , the ism should have had enough time to mix before new star formation occurs .",
    "so we should expect that the enrichment in low - mass and small - scale systems , with very low star formation efficiencies , is more homogeneous rather than more inhomogeneous .",
    "in fact , the cooling time for these small systems could be quite low ( see @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , dsphs seem to be supported by the random motions of stars rather than by regular motions .",
    "so , we expect that the thermalisation processes have been efficient and that the one - zone assumption is reasonable .",
    "finally , small systems do not show evident abundance gradients and this is another indicator of a well mixed ism .",
    "one other important constraint to verify the goodness of a chemical evolution model is to check whether it is able to reproduce the observed stellar mdf . in fig.([mdfsculptoromega10 ] ) , we show the comparison between the observed stellar mdf and our @xmath94 models .",
    "as shown in this figure , by increasing the star formation efficiency , the predicted stellar mdf peaks towards higher @xmath1 $ ] abundances , since shorter time - scales are involved in the galactic chemical enrichment produced by successive generations of stars . at the same time , by increasing the @xmath30 parameter ( especially from @xmath144 to @xmath145 ) , the height of the mdf peak diminishes because of the stronger outflow rate ( @xmath143 ) which leaves , on average , less gas available for star formation . the model which best reproduces the mdf shape of sculptor",

    "the carina dsph has been observed , from the analysis of its cmd , to have undergone a bursty sfh .",
    "so , following @xcite and the suggestions of @xcite , we adopted for the carina dsph a sfh characterized by @xmath183 episodes , all lasting @xmath184 gyr , with the first two occurring from @xmath185 to @xmath183 gyr and the second two occurring from @xmath129 to @xmath186 gyr .",
    "the galaxy dm halo is characterized by a total mass @xmath187 , and a core radius @xmath188 @xcite .",
    "the effective radius of the _ luminous _ ( baryonic ) matter has been set at the value @xmath189 @xcite .",
    "so , the ratio between the core radius of the dm halo and the effective radius of the baryonic matter is @xmath190 .",
    "according to our model of chemical evolution , the galaxy assembled from the accretion of an _ infall mass _ @xmath191 , made up of primordial gas , with the infall time - scale being assumed to be @xmath64 gyr .    in tab.([carinainput ] ) , we have summarized all the chemical evolution models we have computed for the carina dsph .",
    "following the procedure used for the sculptor dsph , we varied again only the @xmath30 and the @xmath44 parameters , namely the star formation efficiency and the wind parameter , respectively .    in fig.([carinasfr ] ) , it is shown the sfr of carina dsph . by looking at that figure , we can see that there is almost a continuous transition between the first ( @xmath192 gyr ) and the second burst ( @xmath193 gyr ) , as well as from the third ( @xmath194 gyr ) and the fourth burst ( @xmath195 gyr ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the time interval between those episodes is so short that nor the galactic wind neither the gas restored by dying stars might have highly affected the gas mass and therefore the intensity of the sfr .",
    "in fact , the sfr has been assumed to be proportional to the gas mass in the galaxy .",
    "the discontinuity is clear only between the second ( @xmath193 gyr ) and the third ( @xmath194 gyr ) burst : during the temporary break ( @xmath196 gyr ) of star formation , the gas mass in the galaxy decreases because of the strong outflow rate .",
    "so , at the epoch of the third burst ( at @xmath129 gyr ) , the intensity of the sfr is much lower than the intensity of the sfr at the end of the second burst ( at @xmath183 gyr ) , when there was much more gas .",

    "conversely , for a fixed value of the star formation efficiency @xmath30 , models with higher values of the wind parameter @xmath44 predict the mdf to shift towards lower @xmath1 $ ] , and both the stellar and gas masses to be lower at the present time .",
    "in order to explain such trends , the same arguments expressed in section [ sculptor_results ] regarding the sculptor dsph are also valid here , and we will not repeat them again .    from tab.([carinatable ] ) , all the chemical evolution models we calculated predict both final gas and stellar masses at the present time which are in agreement with the observations ( @xmath198 from @xcite , and @xmath199 from @xcite ) .",
    "since we adopted low star formation efficiencies , the @xmath0 $ ] ratio is predicted to decrease at very low @xmath1 $ ] , and such a decrease steepens even more once the galactic wind starts ( see also section [ sculptor_abundance ] ) .",

    "originally , their data sample was constituted by low - resolution spectra of @xmath335 stars , which then was extended to @xmath336 stars by adding non - overlapping stars from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this gave rise to an inhomogeneous collection of datasets , which is also a rather poor statistical sample .",
    "as in the case of the hercules stellar mdf ( see section [ hercules : mdf ] ) , also here we are not able to reproduce the height of the observed mdf - peak .",
    "this is clearly illustrated in fig.([mdfbootesi ] ) , where we also show that the only model able to reproduce the peak and the width of the observed mdf is characterized by @xmath334 , @xmath94 and @xmath231 .",
    "( normal wind ) and @xmath231 . again , as in the case of the hercules ufd , the dataset is built up on a sample of only @xmath336 stars , highly concentrated in a very tight @xmath1 $ ] range .",
    "we are not able to reproduce the height of the observed - mdf peak .",
    "the model which best reproduces the @xmath1_{peak}$ ] abundance of the observed mdf turns out to have @xmath334 and @xmath94 .",
    ", width=340 ]      in this paper , we have assumed that dsph galaxies form by accretion of an _ infall mass _ of @xmath191 with primordial chemical composition .",
    "the infall rate obeys to a decaying exponential law with an _",
    "infall time- scale _",
    "@xmath337 gyr .",
    "the mass content and the core radius of the dm halo have been taken from the observations .",
    "in particular , here we modeled sculptor and carina and our results can be summarized as follows .    1 .   only by assuming low star formation efficiencies ( @xmath338 ) relative to the milky way ( @xmath339 in the solar vicinity , @xcite )",
    ", we have been able to explain the decline in the @xmath0 $ ] abundance ratios observed at very low @xmath1 $ ] . in fact ,",
    "the lower the @xmath30 parameter , the lower is the amount of iron produced by type ii sne ; this causes the @xmath1 $ ] of the ism , at which type ia sne become predominant in the iron pollution , to be lower .",
    "this precisely determines the decrease in the @xmath0 $ ] at very low @xmath1 $ ] .",
    "this is due to the fact that most of @xmath8-elements originates in type ii sne whereas most of fe originates in type ia sne exploding on a large range of times ( time - delay model ) .",
    "low star formation efficiencies increase the star formation time - scales , giving rise to stellar mdfs peaked towards very low @xmath1 $ ] , in very good agreement with the observations indicating that dsphs are very metal - poor stellar systems .",
    "3 .   galactic winds - driven by sn explosions - play a relevant role in the dsph chemical evolution .",
    "we adopted for dsphs a _ normal _",
    "wind , i.e. a wind with an efficiency equal for all the chemical elements .",
    "the net effect of the galactic wind is to diminish further the sfr and cause the @xmath0 $ ] to follow a steeper decline as @xmath1 $ ] increases .",
    "thanks to the strong outflow rates , our models predict very low final total gas masses , according to observations . 4 .   only by adopting star formation episodes occurring far beyond the reionization epoch ,",
    "our models were able to build up final total stellar masses of the same order of magnitude as the observed ones ( @xmath340 ) , and they could also reproduce the other observed features of dsph galaxies .",
    "our assumptions were based on the results of the cmd - fitting analysis , which have been able , in the past few years , to derive the sfh of many dwarf galaxies of the local group .",
    "we adopted the @xcite imf for all the models . in a recent paper , @xcite suggested that to explain the abundance data in sagittarius an imf with a lower fraction of massive stars than a salpeter - like imf should be preferred .",
    "however , by testing an imf with a steeper slope in the massive star range , we found a neglibible difference in our results .",
    "our best models are in good agreement with the previous works @xcite and confirm their goodness .",
    "our best model for sculptor requires @xmath152 and @xmath94 , whereas our best model for carina requires @xmath145 and @xmath94 .",
    "we modeled hercules and botes i , by adopting the same numerical code of dsphs but with different characteristic input parameters . in",
    "what follows , we summarize the main features of our ufd chemical evolution models :    1 .",
    "since ufds are known today to be the faintest and most dm dominated galaxies , we adopted _ infall masses _",
    "@xmath341 , which are lower than the ones assumed for dsphs and supported by observations .",
    "such initial reservoir of gas , with primordial chemical composition , was accreted in the galaxy dm halo on a very short typical time - scale ( @xmath266 gyr ) .",
    "2 .   our best model for hercules requires @xmath269 , @xmath94 , @xmath211 and @xmath266 gyr , whereas our best model for botes i requires @xmath334 , @xmath94 , @xmath231 and @xmath266 gyr .",
    "3 .   the @xmath0 $ ] abundance ratios are observed to steeply decrease at very low @xmath1 $ ] .",
    "this is clearly a signature of very low star formation efficiencies ( @xmath342 ) , even lower than for the dsph ones ( @xmath343 ) .",
    "in fact , type ia sne start to dominate in the iron pollution of the ism when the @xmath1 $ ] of the ism is still very low .",
    "this result is in agreement with the previous studies of ufd galaxies , such as @xcite 4 .",
    "the very low adopted star formation efficiencies cause the stellar mdfs to be peaked at very low @xmath1 $ ] , in very good agreement with observations .",
    "5 .   from the cmd - fitting analysis , as well as from the study of the pulsation and metallicity properties of their variable stars , ufds host very old stellar populations , with ages @xmath344 gyr",
    "so , we assumed them to have undergone star formation only in the first gigayears of their chemical evolution history .",
    "this fact , coupled with the very low star formation efficiencies , causes the building up of very low final total stellar masses @xmath345 , which are much lower than the observed dsph ones , and in agreement with observational values .",
    "the actual total gas masses in ufds are negligible or even undetected .",
    "this is a clear evidence of intense galactic winds , which are efficient in the gas removal from the galaxy potential well and started very soon in the galaxy evolution .",
    "we tested models with _",
    "normal wind _",
    ", @xmath8-enhanced _ differential wind _ , and iron - enhanced _",
    "differential wind_. all such models agree in predicting negligible final total gas masses but each of them has a different effect in the @xmath0 $ ] vs. @xmath1 $ ] diagram .",
    "normal _ and @xmath8-enhanced galactic winds predict a trend of the @xmath0 $ ] vs. @xmath1 $ ] diagram which well agrees with observations . on the other hand , an",
    "iron - enhanced _",
    "differential wind _ predicts the @xmath0 $ ] to increase as @xmath1 $ ] grows once the galactic wind has started , at variance with observations .",
    "we suggest the galactic wind to be normal with an efficiency @xmath94 , which is the same value adopted in this work for reproducing the main properties of dsph galaxies .",
    "our chemical evolution models have been able to reproduce , at the same time and reasonably well , all the observed features of the two ufd galaxies studied , such as the abundance ratio patterns of the @xmath8-elements , the stellar mdf , and the total stellar and gas masses at the present time . from the main characteristics of our chemical evolution models and from the observed trend of the ufd chemical abundances",
    ", we suggest that the hypothesis that ufds would have been the survived `` building blocks '' of the milky way halo is unlikely , since the two seem to have undergone very different galactic chemical enrichment histories .",
    "in particular , the galactic halo abundance pattern suggests more vigorous star formation and galactic wind , together with a longer time - scale of gas accretion ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , more data on ufds are necessary before drawing firm conclusions .",
