    "<S> we will give a brief summary of the procedure used there and present the new results in figure 1 . </S>",
    "<S> the data we use is summarized next .    </S>",
    "<S> we begin with the data from cobe . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude is most conveniently characterized in a relatively @xmath0 independent way by the expected hexadecupole moment of the temperature anisotropy @xmath27k , where the error includes effects such as radiometer noise and cosmic variance @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> this data set probes the spectrum on the largest scales ( @xmath28 @xmath29 mpc ) . </S>",
    "<S> for smaller scales , we use the data obtained from large galaxy surveys , particularly that of the infrared astronomy satellite ( iras ) catalogue of galaxies . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite this catalogue was used to obtain a direct estimate of the power spectrum in the range @xmath30/mpc . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting power spectrum is in good agreement with estimates from other surveys based on optically selected galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the iras catalogue of galaxies has also been used in a different way to determine the large scale bulk velocity field . </S>",
    "<S> we use the values given by the potential flow algorithm (  potent \" ) collaboration ( see ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> there are important constraints on the power spectrum which come from structures which have evolved so that their description is inherently non - linear . </S>",
    "<S> if we make some basic assumptions about the formation of these structures , we can use this data to constrain the amplitudes of the fluctuations in the linear theory . </S>",
    "<S> we will use two such pieces of information . </S>",
    "<S> first , in pre - cobe days the normalization of power spectra was usually done by specifying the mass fluctuation on @xmath31 mpc scales , and much effort has been made to determine this normalization from the data . in ref @xcite , an attempt was made to estimate this quantity from the abundance of clusters . </S>",
    "<S> estimates of the mass fluctuation on @xmath31 mpc from different galaxy surveys yield results that are consistent @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we adopt the synthesized value @xmath32 mpc ) @xmath33 as a constraint on the amplitude of linear perturbations .    </S>",
    "<S> second , the number of early quasars at high redshift requires a minimum amplitude of mass fluctuation . </S>",
    "<S> this issue has recently been extensively studied @xcite . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite two of the present authors estimated the error on this amplitude introduced by theoretical modeling uncertainties and found that the lower limit on the amplitude of mass fluctuations required to make the early quasar population is @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> we will use this constraint here as well @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the data are then analyzed in the following way . for a given value of @xmath0 and a hot dark matter fraction @xmath1 , </S>",
    "<S> we calculate up to a normalization factor , the hexadecupole moment of relic temperature fluctuations , the power spectrum for the iras power spectrum wavenumbers , the large scale velocities , the linear mass fluctuation on 8 @xmath29 mpc , and the amplitude of the quasar sized mass fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , while most of our list of constraints depend on the mass fluctuations , the variations in galactic number can be somewhat different than mass fluctuations . to compare our mass fluctuation power spectrum with galactic number we have to also introduce a  density bias factor \" @xmath35 to allow for the possibility the iras galaxies may not trace the mass . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the depth coordinate in the galaxy survey is doppler redshift space rather than physical length introduces some effects which must be corrected for ( see ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . for each value of @xmath1 and @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> we first do a least squares fit of the normalization and the bias factor @xmath35 .    after fitting these parameters , </S>",
    "<S> we proceed to calculate the value of the @xmath36 ( goodness of fit ) statistic from the data for each model . for the bulk velocities , </S>",
    "<S> we have combined the uncertainty due to  cosmic variance \" in quadrature with the quoted analysis errors , because the velocities correspond to a very limited sampling of a gaussian velocity field . after finding the best fitting model , we record how the @xmath36 statistic changes as we vary the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 and draw confidence level contours in the @xmath37 plane @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we repeat this entire procedure for different values of the hubble constant .    </S>",
    "<S> figure one dramatically shows how the data favor values of @xmath0 very close to unity with the actual limits depending somewhat on the mix of dark matter and the hubble constant . </S>",
    "<S> overall we can say that with 99% confidence , @xmath38^{1/2 } < 1.15 $ ] , independent of the dark matter composition . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath26 works well over the range of hubble constants @xmath4 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> it appears that @xmath0 is constrained to be quite close to unity by the data .    </S>",
    "<S> we now discuss how such density fluctuations can be realized in realistic supersymmetric guts . </S>",
    "<S> we are particularly interested in identifying models in which there are no ` fine tuning ' ( including gauge hierarchy ) problems . to set things up , consider the following globally supersymmetric renormalizable superpotential @xmath39 : @xmath40 where @xmath41 denote a conjugate pair of superfields transforming as non - trivial representations of some gauge group , while @xmath42 is a gauge singlet superfield . </S>",
    "<S> this superpotential is ` natural ' in the strong sense @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is of the most general form consistent with r - symmetry under which @xmath43 , @xmath44 , while the product @xmath45 is invariant . </S>",
    "<S> note that cubic terms in @xmath46 and @xmath47 can be forbidden by assuming , for example , the transformations @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> in realistic models such terms may be allowed without altering the main conclusions .    </S>",
    "<S> we point out that , at least in the global susy case , the r - symmetry is the unique choice for implementing the ` false ' vacuum inflationary scenario in a natural way . </S>",
    "<S> it is the only symmetry which can eliminate all of the undesirable self - couplings of the ( inflaton ) @xmath42 , while allowing the linear term in the superpotential . </S>",
    "<S> with supersymmetry unbroken , the potential takes the form ( we represent the scalar components with the same symbols as the superfields if there is no danger of confusion ! ) : @xmath49 + \\mid \\kappa \\phi \\bar{\\phi } - \\mu^2\\mid^2 + d-\\rm{terms}\\ ] ] the @xmath50-terms vanish along the ( d - flat ) direction @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the only supersymmetric minimum of the potential is at @xmath52 we will say more about the scale @xmath15 shortly .    </S>",
    "<S> consider now an early universe scenario with chaotic initial conditions . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath53 , the effective potential @xmath54 is minimized by @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> that is , for @xmath56 , the energy density is dominated by the ` false ' vacuum energy density @xmath57 , which can therefore lead to an exponentially expanding ( inflationary ) universe . </S>",
    "<S> the potential in ( 2 ) does not contain a term which can drive @xmath42 to its minimum value . </S>",
    "<S> this , however , is no longer the case when the quantum corrections are taken into consideration .    with @xmath56 , </S>",
    "<S> both @xmath46 and @xmath58 vanish and there is a nonzero @xmath59 which breaks supersymmetry , such that the one loop corrections to the effective potential are non - vanishing , and given by @xcite @xmath60 where the summation is over all helicity states , @xmath61 indicates that the bosons and fermions make opposite sign contributions , and @xmath62 denotes a renormalization mass . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum corrections will help drive @xmath42 to its minimum .    </S>",
    "<S> note that for @xmath63 there is no mass splitting inside the gauge supermultiplets or the @xmath42-superfield ( actually the masses of @xmath42-scalar and its fermionic superpartner both vanish ) . </S>",
    "<S> the non - vanishing contribution is from the mass splitting within the @xmath46 , @xmath47 superfields . </S>",
    "<S> the complex scalars in @xmath64 are split by the nonzero @xmath65-term into two pairs of real scalar and pseudoscalar components with mass squared @xmath66 , whereas the fermionic partners have mass @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> the one loop corrected effective potential ( along the inflationary trajectory @xmath68 , @xmath69 ) is given by @xmath70 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if @xmath42 is sufficiently greater than @xmath71 , @xmath72 reduces to the simpler form @xmath73\\ ] ]    for @xmath56 , the inflationary phase is dominated by the false vacuum energy @xmath57 as in the tree level case , but the additional contribution in ( 5 ) will now drive @xmath42 to its minimum . </S>",
    "<S> the gut phase transition takes place only after the @xmath42 field drops to its critical value @xmath74 . below @xmath71 , the @xmath42 field </S>",
    "<S> is driven to zero by the positive mass term @xmath75 which is increasingly more effective due to the increase of the @xmath76 vevs ( induced by the decreasing @xmath42 ) . </S>",
    "<S> all of the fields rapidly adjust to their vacuum values ( 3 ) , thereby restoring supersymmetry .    </S>",
    "<S> note that the end of inflation does not necessarily coincide with the gut phase transition which occurs when @xmath42 approaches @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> the end is signaled when the  slow roll \" condition is violated for some @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> we can characterize the  </S>",
    "<S> slow roll \" condition as ( see first paper in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) @xmath77 where @xmath78 ( the prime refers to derivatives with respect to @xmath42 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the inflationary phase may end before the gut transition if the above conditions are violated at some @xmath63 . for convenience </S>",
    "<S> , we can use the parametrization @xmath79 , where the parameter @xmath80 characterizes the rolling of @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> ( the gut phase transition occurs for @xmath81 . ) </S>",
    "<S> the quantities @xmath82 and @xmath83 are given by @xmath84 ^ 2 \\nonumber\\\\ \\eta = ( { \\kappa m_p \\over 4 \\pi m_x})^2 { 1 \\over 8 \\pi } [ ( 3x^2 - 1)ln(1- { 1 \\over x^2 } ) + ( 3x^2 + 1)ln(1 + { 1 \\over x^2})]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that @xmath83 becomes infinitely large for @xmath81 , so that inflation ends as @xmath80 approaches 1 ( from above ) .    </S>",
    "<S> so far , we have not introduced any supersymmetry violation in the system ( the global minimum in ( 3 ) is supersymmetric ) . in conventional schemes </S>",
    "<S> ( say n=1 supergravity ) , this breaking is introduced through the soft susy violating terms in the tree level potential . </S>",
    "<S> the main influence of such terms on the inflationary scenario discussed above arises from the fact that the susy breaking induces a tev scale @xmath85-term for the scalars , in particular for the @xmath42 field . </S>",
    "<S> the term @xmath86 ( @xmath87 tev ) provides an extra force driving @xmath42 to the minimum . </S>",
    "<S> however , unless the coupling constant @xmath88 is very small , the soft mass terms only provide a small correction to @xmath72 in ( 5 ) , and so can not significantly affect the above dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> this is not surprising since for @xmath56 , the non - supersymmetric @xmath89 splitting inside the @xmath90 superfields is @xmath91 which , as we shall see , is much larger then @xmath92 . in such a situation </S>",
    "<S> the inflationary scenario above is practically independent of the particular mechanism of supersymmetry breaking .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now compare the predicted quadrupole anisotropy , based on ( 5 ) , with the value ( @xmath93 ) measured by cobe . from the scalar density fluctuations </S>",
    "<S> one has ( see first paper in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) @xmath94 where the subscript @xmath95 indicates the value of @xmath42 as the scale ( which evolved to the present horizon size ) crossed outside the de sitter horizon during inflation , and @xmath96 denotes the appropriate number of e - foldings . </S>",
    "<S> the formula in ( 10 ) is remarkable in that the fluctuation amplitude is proportional to @xmath97 , just as in the cosmic string scenario ! </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude turns out to be in the right ball park , without having to ` fine tune ' additional parameters ( such as dimensionless quartic couplings and/or the mass of the inflaton ) . using ( 10 ) </S>",
    "<S> , we can estimate the fundamental parameter @xmath15 to be on the order of @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> we have ignored the contribution of the tensor fluctuations to the anisotropy , because they are suppressed by a factor of @xmath99 $ ] relative to the scalar component in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 10 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the spectral index @xmath0 of the density fluctuations is given by @xmath100 which , as we have seen earlier , is in the central range of the values preferred by observations .    </S>",
    "<S> an estimate of the coupling @xmath88 is obtained from the relation @xmath101 with @xmath102 say , ( which corresponds to @xmath103 gev , and the planck scale corrections can be safely ignored ) , the coupling @xmath88 turns out to be on the order of @xmath104 . </S>",
    "<S> note that for this value of @xmath88 , the tensor generated anisotropies are less than @xmath105 of the scalar anisotropy amplitude .    </S>",
    "<S> having outlined how supersymmetric models can lead to a successful inflationary scenario without invoking small dimensionless couplings , we now proceed to discuss how this idea can be realized in realistic susy guts . </S>",
    "<S> we would like the model to be well motivated from the particle physics viewpoint . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , a non - trivial constraint would be the absence of the gauge hierarchy and proton decay problems . </S>",
    "<S> although this constraint presumably can be met in guts such as @xmath12 or @xmath13 , the higgs sector of the theory becomes quite messy . </S>",
    "<S> an even more formidable constraint stems from the fact that the phase transition involving the gauge non - singlet fields @xmath106 occurs at the end of inflation . in @xmath12 </S>",
    "<S> this would lead to the monopole problem . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore must resort to susy guts with rank 5 or higher in order that at least the possibility exists for the monopoles to be inflated away .    </S>",
    "<S> the simplest example of susy guts we are aware of in which the gauge hierarchy problem can be resolved with a minimal higgs system is based on @xmath107 ) . under the gauge group @xmath11 , </S>",
    "<S> the left handed lepton , quark and antiquark superfields respectively transform as @xmath108 and @xmath109 . </S>",
    "<S> they are denoted as @xmath110 and @xmath111 : @xmath112 @xmath113 here @xmath114 and @xmath115 denote @xmath116 doublet superfields , @xmath117 is an @xmath116 singlet , @xmath118 and @xmath119 are standard model singlets , while @xmath120 denote additional down - type quark ( antiquark ) superfields . the @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) symmetry acts along columns ( rows ) . </S>",
    "<S> the symmetry breaking of @xmath11 to @xmath123 requires at least two sets of higgs supermultiplets , @xmath124 and @xmath125 , where @xmath126 transform as @xmath127 above . </S>",
    "<S> the conjugate fields @xmath128 are needed to ensure that the susy breaking scale is well below the gut scale and that the anomalies cancel .    </S>",
    "<S> imposition of a suitable r - symmetry , largely determined by the requirement that a pair of electroweak doublets ( in @xmath129 ) remains light , fixes the renormalizable part of the superpotential as follows ( we will not give the couplings involving the chiral fermion families ) :    @xmath130    here the bilinear and trilinear terms stand for the appropriate @xmath11 invariant combinations . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , @xmath131 , etc . , where the greek ( latin ) indices refer to @xmath132 . </S>",
    "<S> the r - charges of the superfields are as follows : @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 , where @xmath138 under r. the superlarge vevs will be oriented along the directions @xmath139 @xmath140 the absence of a @xmath141 term in ( 14 ) guarantees that the electroweak doublet pair @xmath142 in @xmath129 remains massless at tree level , despite the gut symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> the well known ` @xmath143-term ' for this pair is generated by the non - renormalizable coupling @xmath144 which is the leading contribution allowed by the r - symmetry . with @xmath145 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath143 is in the tev range as desired . </S>",
    "<S> [ note that without the @xmath146 term , the superpotential in ( 14 ) would be invariant under @xmath147 ^ 2 $ ] . ]    </S>",
    "<S> it is important to point out that in addition to resolving the gauge hierarchy problem , the r - symmetry guarantees the absence of dimension four and five baryon number violating operators . </S>",
    "<S> that is , cubic superpotential couplings such as @xmath148 are absent , where the @xmath149 s and @xmath150 s carry r - charges @xmath151 . </S>",
    "<S> the proton is essentially stable according to this model . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the desired couplings such as @xmath152 , which provide masses for the quarks , are allowed . similarly , there are no undesirable lepton number violating couplings .    </S>",
    "<S> the superpotential ( 14 ) is the generalization of ( 1 ) , on which the inflationary scenario was based , to a realisitic susy gut model . without going into the details , which will be published elsewhere , we briefly summarize how things work out . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite that the resolution of the gauge hierarchy problem within the framework of @xmath11 necessarily leads to an additional pair of electroweak doublets . </S>",
    "<S> ( actually , one effectively ends up with a @xmath162 of @xmath12 , of mass @xmath163 . </S>",
    "<S> unification of the three gauge couplings at scales @xmath164 is thereby preserved . ) </S>",
    "<S> this strongly suggests generating the baryon asymmetry at the electroweak scale . </S>",
    "<S> the reheat temperature in this scheme is high , @xmath165 gev , which means that the gravitino mass must be large in order that the primordial gravitino problem is avoided . </S>",
    "<S> precisely how this works out would depend on how local supersymmetry is broken .    </S>",
    "<S> as far as dark matter is concerned , the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is completely stable and so presents itself as an ideal ` cold ' dark matter candidate . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , one can speculate here about the nature of the lsp . </S>",
    "<S> the point is that in the absence of the two lighter families , the well known parameter @xmath166 of the mssm is equal to @xmath167 at the gut scale @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> ( this follows from the superpotential coupling @xmath168 . ) </S>",
    "<S> coupled with the radiative electroweak breaking scenario , this leads to a cold dark matter candidate essentially composed of the bino with mass in the range of 200 - 350 gev .    </S>",
    "<S> what about the neutrinos in this scheme ? </S>",
    "<S> the lepton chiral supermultiplets @xmath169 transform according to the same @xmath11 representation as the higgs supermultiplets @xmath170 . </S>",
    "<S> the r - symmetry allows the coupling @xmath171 provided that the r - charge of @xmath127 is @xmath172 . </S>",
    "<S> this is needed to provide mass say to the @xmath173 lepton . </S>",
    "<S> but it also gives a dirac mass @xmath174 to the @xmath175 and @xmath176 neutrinos in @xmath127 . </S>",
    "<S> now , the r - symmetry prevents one from giving a large majorana mass to the @xmath119 fields , which could make the neutrinos unacceptably heavy . </S>",
    "<S> we are therefore led to introduce three g - singlet superfields @xmath177 ( one per chiral family ) in order that the standard see - saw mechanism can be implemented . </S>",
    "<S> one of the neutrinos can now have a mass in the few electron volt as suggested by the data on large scale structure formation .    in conclusion , it is gratifying to learn that a satisfactory inflationary scenario , consistent with large scale structure observations , can be realized in realistic supersymmetric guts in which the sector that ` drives ' inflation is determined by particle physics considerations , and no fine tuning of the parameters is needed .    </S>",
