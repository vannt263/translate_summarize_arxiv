    "realizing topologically non - trivial states of matter in band insulators has been the subject of growing interest in recent years . in the quantum anomalous hall ( qah )",
    "insulator @xcite , the time - reversal symmetry broken ground state has a bulk insulating gap but has topologically protected chiral edge states . in the time - reversal invariant quantum spin - hall ( qsh ) insulator @xcite a pair of helical edge states , with electrons of opposite spin counterpropagating at the sample boundaries , are mandated by the non - trivial topology of the bulk electronic states .",
    "the behavior of non - interacting insulating topological phases is presently well understood @xcite .",
    "taking into account the effect of electronic correlations , many intriguing questions arise .",
    "for instance , electronic interactions may give rise to insulating topological phases without non - interacting analogs , i.e. the symmetry protected topological phase  @xcite , or fractional topological insulators  @xcite .",
    "another class of interacting topological states are phases of interacting electrons in which chiral orbital currents or spin - orbit coupling are spontaneously generated by electron correlations . in these quantum states",
    "conventional symmetry breaking order is inextricably linked to their nontrivial topological character , and they have been called topological mott insulators ( tmi )  @xcite .",
    "both the qah and the qsh insulator were originally conceived in the context of honeycomb lattice dirac fermions  @xcite , by adding spin ( in)dependent terms to the dirac hamiltonian that couple to the dirac fermions as valley - dependent dirac masses .",
    "similarly , the first proposal for realizing a tmi originated from honeycomb lattice dirac fermions , which were shown to be dynamically gapped out by finite range density - density interactions  @xcite .",
    "these proposals hold the exciting promise of observing electronically self - organized topological insulators with single - layer graphene as the prime canidate material .",
    "two main complications arise , however , in the case of honeycomb lattice dirac fermions .",
    "first , the stability of the qah state generally relies on physically unrealistic interaction energy scales .",
    "in particular , it requires the next - nearest neighbor ( nnn ) interaction to be stronger than the nearest neighbor ( nn ) interaction , an unlikely situation in for instance graphene  @xcite .",
    "second , the vanishing density of states at half filling implies , even at zero temperature , a finite critical interaction strength for the qah state to be stabilized , which also raises questions as to the validity of the hartree - fock approximation .",
    "recent exact diagonalization studies , indeed , have not been able to confirm the mean field results  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we present a simple and physically intuitive way to overcome these hurdles and realize the tmi on the honeycomb lattice . the central idea of our proposal is to alter the electronic properties of the honeycomb dirac semimetal by means of substrate - induced electrostatic potentials with an hexagonal superlattice structure of tripled unit cell .    in their simplest form , these substrate - induced potentials",
    "take the form of non - abelian @xmath1 gauge fields in the low - energy descriptions of honeycomb lattice electrons .",
    "although gauge potentials of any origin generally shift the dirac cones in momentum space @xcite , we show that for the combinations of @xmath2 gauge field components originating from an hexagonal underlay with tripled unit cell , the dirac cones morph into a quadratic band crossing point ( qbcp ) .",
    "higher order harmonic components of the superlattice potential respecting translational invariance but making the sublattices inequivalent can remove the qbcp and open up a spectral gap . in the qbcp regime",
    ", we analyze the effect of interactions in two ways .",
    "first , we use a perturbative renomalization group ( rg ) approach to establish that as a consequence of the qbcp the system has a weak - coupling instability in much the same way as was established for generic symmetry protected qbcps  @xcite . however , in contrast to these models , the possible occurrence of an interaction - induced rotational symmetry - breaking nematic phase  @xcite with the qbcp splitting into two dirac cones is prohibited by the fact that the hexagonal underlay fully breaks the three - fold rotational symmetry of the honeycomb lattice , leaving the time - reversal symmetry breaking qah gapped state as the only instability at weak coupling .",
    "we use hartree - fock theory to show that the interaction - induced qah state is indeed realized at weak coupling .     and @xmath3 with @xmath4 .",
    "( b ) on the left the brillouin zone of graphene and the folded brillouin zone corresponding unit cell tripling ( inner black haxagon ) . on the right the sets of superlattice wave vectors @xmath5 and @xmath6 with respect to the two brillouin zones .",
    "( c ) red dots indicate minima of @xmath7 superlattice potential generated by @xmath5 giving rise to the qbcp .",
    "( d ) minima of the second order superlattice components @xmath6 . ]",
    "superlattices  @xcite have attracted tremendous interest as they allow to accurately manipulate the band structure of two - dimensional materials and hence hold the promise of tailored electronic properties .",
    "superlattices of a dirac semimetal , with graphene epitaxially grown on prepatterned substrates being the canonical example  @xcite , lead to a rich plethora of phenomena such as dirac fermions cloning @xcite or strongly anisotropic massless chiral fermions  @xcite .",
    "generally , the physics of these honeycomb superstructures can be described by considering the effect of a substrate - induced external electrostatic potential acting on the pristine honeycomb lattice sites . within this approach , the generation of secondary dirac cones with halved group velocity in large graphene moir superstructures @xcite has been identified  @xcite .",
    "we therefore use the same conceptual starting point and consider electrons on a honeycomb lattice , in the presence of an external electrostatic perturbation originating from a commensurate @xmath8 hexagonal underlay , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](a ) .",
    "the @xmath8 hexagonal superlattice , having a unit cell three times larger than the elementary honeycomb unit cell , allows for potential configurations leading to a qbcp .    in the most general setting , non - interacting spinless fermions subject to electrostatic potentials with @xmath8 hexagonal periodicity are described by the tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath9 where @xmath10 indicates the nn hopping amplitude , the @xmath11 s , @xmath12 s are the on - site energies renormalized by the substrate perturbation and the fermionic operator @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) annihilates an electron at position @xmath15 in the sublattice @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) with @xmath4 . here",
    "@xmath18 denotes a sum over all nn combinations of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and @xmath21 ( same for @xmath22 ) .",
    "as the real space unit cell is tripled , the brillouin zone ( bz ) is folded , with the corners of the hexagonal lattice bz , the so - called dirac points , now occurring at the @xmath23 point .    to gain insight in the effect of the substrate - induced potentials on the electronic structure , we consider the effective low - energy theory close to the @xmath23 point of the folded brillouin zone ( bz ) [ see the supplemental material for details ] .",
    "the low - energy honeycomb lattice dirac fermions are modified in the following way @xmath24 \\nonumber \\\\ & & +    { \\cal v}_+ \\ ,    \\tau_0 \\sigma_0 +   { \\cal v}_- \\ , \\tau_0 \\sigma_3 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the fermi velocity , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and the @xmath28 and @xmath29 operators are pauli matrices acting on the sublattice and valley degrees of freedom of the honeycomb lattice , respectively .",
    "in addition , we introduced the dirac matrices @xmath30 ( @xmath31 )  @xcite , which are given by @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "these matrices commute with the @xmath35 matrices , and in addition realize an @xmath2 pseudo - spin algebra @xmath36 = 2 i \\epsilon_{ijk } { \\cal q}_k$ ] .",
    "we have defined @xmath37 as the sum and the difference of the average potentials on each sublattice , i.e. @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the sum @xmath40 couples to the identity @xmath41 whereas the difference couples to @xmath42 , which anticommutes with the @xmath35 and corresponds to an inversion symmetry breaking dirac mass @xcite [ c.f .",
    "[ fig : fig1](b ) ] .",
    "the remaining four linear combinations of potentials enter as gauge fields @xmath43 and @xmath44  @xcite and couple to the @xmath30 .",
    "the explicit expressions for these linear combinations are summarized in table  [ tab : potentials ] . for specific combinations of these pseudo - gauge fields @xmath43 and @xmath44 , the low - energy spectrum becomes quadratic as opposed to dirac - linear , and these pseudo - gauge field configurations were shown to generate an effective nonzero non - abelian field strength  @xcite .",
    "having discussed the general structure of the hamiltonian , we proceed to show that substrate induced electrostatic potentials can realize such pseudo - gauge field configurations .",
    "the renormalization of the on - site energies due to a commensurate hexagonal underlay with tripled unit cell can be obtained following the observation @xcite that the electrostatic potential felt by the spinless electrons is smoothened by the large separation between the system and the substrate , as compared to the separation of nn honeycomb lattice sites .",
    "we therefore consider a smooth superlattice perturbation with triangular periodicity , expressed as @xmath45 .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath46 only depend on the modulus of @xmath47 , and we restrict the @xmath47 s to the simplest set of wavevectors @xmath48 @xcite with equal magnitude @xmath49 , @xmath50 being the honeycomb lattice constant .",
    "we distinguish two alternatives for choosing the origin of the superlattice perturbation @xmath51 with respect to the center of a reference honeycomb lattice hexagon . in case",
    "the origin of the superlattice perturbation coincides with the center of the reference hexagon , no symmetries other than translational symmetry are broken and one finds @xmath52 , meaning no electrostatic effect on the electrons at lattice sites .",
    "if , however , the center of the superlattice electrostatic potential is aligned with a honeycomb lattice site , the on - site energies on the @xmath53 sublattice take the values @xmath54 and @xmath55 , while the @xmath22-sublattice sites remain unaffected .",
    "the latter case is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](c ) . in terms of the effective low - energy hamiltonian of eq .",
    "this yields the explicit expressions for the gauge fields @xmath56 and @xmath57 , while we find that @xmath58 and @xmath59 vanish ( see also table  [ tab : potentials ] ) .",
    "given these expressions , the low - energy dispersion is readily obtained as @xmath60 where @xmath61 .",
    "two bands touch at @xmath23 to form a qbcp as a direct consequence of the gauge fields following from the specific arrangement of the substrate .",
    ".the effect of substrate induced electrostratic potentials in the low - energy electronic structure .",
    "this first column lists the dirac matrices , the second column the combination of potentials @xmath62 ( @xmath39 ) which couple to the respective terms .",
    "note the definitions @xmath38 and @xmath63 , where in latter we used @xmath64}$ ] .",
    "the third and fourth column list the specific values of these potentials in terms of the potential amplitudes @xmath65 and @xmath66 , capturing the effect of first and second harmonics , respectively . [ cols=\"^,<,^,^,^ \" , ]     contrary to qbcps protected by lattice symmetries and carrying a @xmath67 berry flux @xcite , the qbcp emerging from the substrate - induced potentials is not protected by any symmetries that may quantize the berry flux .",
    "topologically stable qbcp can only be gapped out by @xmath68-breaking perturbations , whereas the qbcp engineered by breaking symmetries can be energetically split by @xmath68-invariant perturbations . specifically , we find that a full substrate - induced bandgap naturally arises by taking into account the next set of harmonics in the superlattice perturbation @xmath51 .",
    "the corresponding wavevectors have equal magnitude @xmath69 and are given by @xmath70 .",
    "the inclusion of this additional set of harmonics in @xmath51 does not affect gauge field terms , but rather introduces a finite @xmath71 which takes the value @xmath72 and a finite @xmath73 .",
    "apart from the identity term , the dispersion of the low - energy hamiltonian eq .   then explicitly reads @xmath74^{1/2}$ ] . with this ,",
    "massive dirac fermions and hence a full substrate - induced bandgap occur for @xmath75 .",
    "we find that the transition from the gapless qbcp regime to the gapped one is marked by the presence of a pseudo - spin-1 conical - like spectrum [ see the supplemental material ] .    ) of substrate induced potentials .",
    "representative examples are shown for which the qbcp emerges , i.e. @xmath76 ( red ) and @xmath77 ( blue ) .",

    "( c ) scaling of the slopes of the linear fits in ( b ) as funtion of @xmath83 .",
    "solid line represents a linear fit . ]",
    "the possibility to engineer a qbcp in the honeycomb lattice band structure at half filling using a hexagonal superlattice suggests a closer investigation of electron - electron interactions and their effect on the electronic ordering in the qbcp regime .",
    "the effect of interactions on a qbcp have been studied previously both with rg methods and mean field theory  @xcite , but since the qbcp under consideration here is different in nature , these results do not directly apply . in order to establish whether the electrostatic potential - induced qbcp is still marginally unstable to weak repulsive interactions ,",
    "we have employed a perturbative rg approach . to this end , we first obtained a continuum model of spinless interacting electrons on the honeycomb lattice .",
    "the non - interacting continuum theory contains the substrate potentials and we only retain the first set of harmonics setting @xmath84 . to obtain a continuum qbcp theory",
    "we take the dirac hamiltonian of eq .   and project the momentum dependent part into the two - component low - energy subspace at @xmath23 .",
    "we find that the substrate potentials enter as an effective mass , i.e. @xmath85 , and hence control the density of states ( dos ) .",
    "there are two interactions to consider , the nn interaction @xmath86 and nnn interaction @xmath79 given by the hamiltonian @xmath87 . deriving the effective continuum vertices ,",
    "i.e. projecting the interactions into the low - energy subspace , shows that @xmath86 is irrelevant in the weak coupling regime  @xcite due to the specific structure of the low - energy states .",
    "these are localized exclusively on one of the sublattices , the @xmath22 sublattice for our choice of potentials , and hence an intersublattice interaction can not contribute . in deriving the rg @xmath88-function",
    "we follow the scheme laid out in  @xcite .",
    "we find , that to one - loop order , the rg-@xmath88 function is given by @xmath89 with @xmath90 , which is equivalent in structure to the result obtained in  @xcite and we thus conclude that the coupling @xmath79 flows to strong coupling .",
    "based on the result that @xmath79 flows to strong coupling , we employ mean - field techniques to determine the type of ordering that is realized . as a first step , we have calculated the normal state susceptibilities @xmath91 to various orders in the absence of potentials , and find that fluctuations in the qah channel are strongest ( see the supplemental material ) . in the presence of substrate potentials , which engineer the weak - coupling instability , one thus expects the interaction - induced qah state .",
    "this is confirmed by extensive restricted and unrestricted mean - field calculations , performed for a range of parameters @xmath92 at zero temperature . in the mean - field calculations we have explicitly allowed for the formation of intra - sublattice charge redistribution , as these have lower energy than the qah state at large @xmath79 in case of pristine graphene  @xcite .",
    "details of the mean - field decoupling in the six - atom unit cell may be found in ref .  . for finite @xmath79",
    "we consistently find the qah state as the mean - field ground state .",
    "the rg calculation provides us with quantitative predictions regarding the scaling of the qah order parameter @xmath78 as function of coupling constant @xmath79 .",
    "we have used restricted mean field calculations , i.e. only decoupling in the qah channel , to check these predictions .",
    "specifically , one expects that @xmath93 scales as @xmath94 where @xmath95 is an energy cutoff of the order of the bandwidth , and @xmath96 .",
    "hence , we expect @xmath97 to depend linearly on @xmath82 . fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](b ) shows a linear fit of @xmath97 obtained from numerical restricted mean field calculations .",
    "we observe that the linear fit works well for values of the superlattice potentials ranging from @xmath98 to @xmath99 .",
    "[ fig : fig2](c ) shows a linear fit of the slope of the linear fits of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](b ) as function of @xmath100 .",
    "again one expects linear behaviour which the panel ( c ) clearly shows .",
    "based on both the rg and the mean field approaches we therefore conclude that the substrate induced qbcp gives rise to a weak - coupling instability towards a time - reversal breaking qah state .",
    "we have shown , in conclusion , the emergence of a qbcp in the half - filled honeycomb lattice resulting from electrostatic coupling to a substrate with hexagonal symmetry but with @xmath8 periodicity , i.e. a tripled unit cell .",
    "the superlattice potential couples to the low - energy dirac fermions as a specific linear combinations of pseudo gauge fields of @xmath1 type , corresponding to a nonzero non - abelian field strength .",
    "the qbcp we have shown to arise in the presence of hexagonal superlattices carries a trivial zero berry flux and can be removed in favor of a full spectral gap by additional modulations of electrostatic potentials . in the qbcp regime , we have shown that a topological quantum anomalous hall phase can be generated by repulsive nn and nnn interactions even when the latter is small , a regime which is naturally realized in graphene . a one - loop rg analysis supplemented by hartree - fock mean field calculations demonstrate that the quadratic low - energy dispersion is marginally unstable to the formation of the qah phase at arbitrarily weak repulsive electronic interactions .",
    "using density functional theory ( dft ) a qbcp has been recently found in a graphene - indium chalcogenide heterostructure where single layer graphene is deposited on top of hexagonal in@xmath101te@xmath101 monolayers @xcite .",
