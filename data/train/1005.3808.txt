    "starting with cobe s groundbreaking detection of microwave background fluctuations @xcite , the past two decades have seen dramatic improvements in measurements of the microwave background temperature fluctuations ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "planck s highly anticipated temperature power spectrum measurements ( see @xcite ) will further advance this program and produce significantly improved constraints on cosmological parameters .    while planck s measurement of the anisotropy power spectrum to multipoles @xmath0 will extract most of the information in primordial temperature fluctuations , ongoing and planned ground - based and balloon - based experiments are exploring two important open frontiers : ( a ) the measurement of extremely ( @xmath1 ) small - scale temperature and polarization fluctuations @xcite and ( b ) the search for primordial b - modes , the distinctive signature of gravitational waves from inflation , on large scales @xcite .",
    "for example , balloon - borne experiments such as ebex @xcite and spider @xcite will improve the measurements of cmb polarization while ground based telescopes such as the atacama cosmology telescope ( act ) @xcite and the south pole telescope @xcite will extend temperature and polarization measurements to smaller , sub - arcminute , angular scales .",
    "proposals for next generation cmb satellites such as cmbpol @xcite or b - pol @xcite are under evaluation from american and european space agencies .",
    "what will we learn from measuring cmb temperature and polarization fluctuations on small - scales ?",
    "the amplitude of temperature and polarization fluctuations is determined by several different physical effects : ( 1 ) the amplitude of primordial fluctuations , ( 2 ) the evolution of the ionization fraction of the universe at @xmath2 , which determines the sound speed for acoustic fluctuations , ( 3 ) the evolution of the ionization fraction of the universe at @xmath3 , which determines the thickness of the surface of last scatter and ( 4 ) the transition from radiation to matter domination . moreover , while small - scale cmb fluctuations are initially pure @xmath4 mode , gravitational lensing rotates @xmath4 modes into @xmath5 modes @xcite . by measuring the pattern of small scale @xmath4 and @xmath5 modes",
    ", cosmologists will be able to determine the large - scale convergence field , a direct measure of the integrated density fluctuations between redshift @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( see e.g. @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "the convergence power spectrum is particularly sensitive to density fluctuations at @xmath8 , an important complement to planned optical lensing measurements that probe the evolution of density fluctuations in the @xmath9 universe .",
    "the goal of this paper is to quantify the cosmological information that could come from these new datasets .",
    "this is important for several reasons .",
    "first , while there have been many studies of the future cosmological constraints from planck , very few papers have investigated the constraining power of combinations of future cmb datasets from different sources .",
    "second , as we will describe in the next sections , we will consider a large set of parameters focusing on those that mainly affect the `` damping tail '' of the cmb angular spectrum .",
    "we consider additional parameters such as the total neutrino mass @xmath10 ( which affects the growth of structure in the late universe ) , the number of additional relativistic neutrino species @xmath11 ( which changes the matter - radiation epoch ) , and possible changes in the recombination process due to changes in the fractional helium abundance @xmath12 , dark matter self - annihilation processes , and variations in fundamental constants such as as the fine structure constant @xmath13 and newton s gravitational constant @xmath14 .",
    "we will not only show the constraints on each single parameter but also the degeneracies among them .",
    "we will consider @xmath15 experimental configurations : the planck satellite @xcite , the combination of planck with act fitted with polarization - sensitive detectors , actpol , @xcite and , finally , the next cmbpol satellite @xcite .",
    "recent studies have already fully demonstrated the ability of next generation satellite missions to constrain inflationary parameters @xcite and the reionization history @xcite in the framework of the cmbpol concept mission study ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "for this reason we will not consider primordial gravitational waves , more general reionization scenarios or experiments that will mainly probe large angular scale polarization in this paper .",
    "this paper will show that next generation cmb experiments can significantly improve constraints on cosmology and fundamental physics and could produce a detection of neutrino mass .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "section ii describes our analysis approach .",
    "section iii presents our analysis for improved constraints from the planned actpol experiment and for the proposed cmbpol experiment . in section",
    "iv we present our conclusions .",
    "we generate synthetic datasets for the planck , actpol and cmbpol experiments following the commonly used approach described for example in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these datasets are generated starting from the assumption of a fiducial `` true '' cosmological model compatible with the wmap-5 maximum likelihood parameters @xcite , i.e. with baryon density @xmath16 , cold dark matter density @xmath17 , spectral index @xmath18 , and optical depth @xmath19 .",
    "this model also assumes a flat universe with a cosmological constant , massless neutrinos with effective number @xmath20 , standard recombination , helium fraction @xmath21 and all fundamental constants fixed to their current values ( we will vary all these parameters later ) .",
    "given the fiducial model , we use the publicly available boltzmann code camb  @xcite to calculate the corresponding theoretical angular power spectra @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 for temperature , cross temperature - polarization and polarization .. mode lensing channel , we will discuss this choice later in this section ]    the synthetic datasets are then generated by considering for each @xmath25 a noise spectrum given by :    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the fwhm of the beam assuming a gaussian profile and where @xmath28 is the experimental power noise related to the detectors sensitivity @xmath29 by @xmath30 .",
    "we assume that beam uncertainties are small and that uncertainties due to foreground removal are smaller than statistical errors .",
    "these are demanding assumptions ; however , the experimental groups are working hard to achieve these goals .    together with the primary anisotropy signal we also take into account information from cmb weak lensing , considering the power spectrum of the deflection field @xmath31 and its cross correlation with temperature maps @xmath32 .",
    "a large number of methods have been suggested for lensing extraction from cmb maps .",
    "all these methods exploit the non - gaussian signal induced by lensing . here",
    "we use the quadratic estimator method of hu & okamoto  @xcite , that provides an algorithm for estimating the corresponding noise spectrum @xmath33 from the observed cmb primary anisotropy and noise power spectra .    this method does nt include the polarization @xmath34 channel since is dominated by the lensing signal .",
    "the planck experiment is not sensitive to the @xmath34 lensing signal , while the cmbpol experiment and , possibly , actpol could detect it . while algorithms are available that can in principle include in the forecast the lensing @xmath34 signal , here we take the conservative approach to not include it .",
    "this leaves open the possibility to use this channel for further checks for foregrounds contamination and systematics .",
    "we generate mock datasets with noise properties consistent respectively with the planck mission ( see @xcite ) , the act telescope @xcite and the future cmbpol experiment @xcite . for the simulated planck dataset",
    "we consider the detectors at @xmath35 and @xmath36 while for actpol we use the single @xmath37 channel .",
    "for cmbpol we also consider the single @xmath37 channel .",
    "the experimental specifications are reported in table  [ tab : exp ] where the sensitivity @xmath29 is in units of @xmath38 .",
    "once a mock dataset is produced we compare a generic theoretical model through a likelihood @xmath39 defined as    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is defined as @xmath42    where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the fiducial and theoretical spectra plus noise respectively , and @xmath45 , @xmath46 denote the determinants of the theoretical and observed data covariance matrices respectively ,    @xmath47    and finally @xmath48 is the sky fraction sampled by the experiment after foregrounds removal .",
    "we derive constraints from simulated data using a modified version of the publicly available markov chain monte carlo package ` cosmomc ` @xcite with a convergence diagnostic based on the gelman and rubin statistic performed on @xmath49 chains .",
    "we sample the following nine - dimensional set of cosmological parameters , adopting flat priors on them : the physical baryon and cold dark matter density fractions , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , the ratio of the sound horizon to the angular diameter distance at decoupling , @xmath52 , the scalar spectral index @xmath53 , the overall normalization of the spectrum @xmath54 at @xmath55 mpc@xmath56 , the optical depth to reionization , @xmath57 , the total mass of neutrinos , @xmath10 , the primordial helium abundance , @xmath12 , and the dark energy equation of state @xmath58 .",
    "we also consider parameters that can change the process of recombination : the dark matter self - annihilation rate @xmath59 , a variation in the fine structure constant @xmath60 and in newton s constant @xmath61 , where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the currently measured values .",
    "for these latter parameters we choose to sample the hubble constant @xmath64 instead of @xmath52 since these parameters are derived assuming standard recombination .",
    "we also use a cosmic age top - hat prior with 10 gyr@xmath65 20 gyr .",
    "furthermore , we consider adiabatic initial conditions and we impose flatness . + in what follows we will consider temperature and polarization power spectrum data up to @xmath66 , due to possible unresolved foreground contamination at smaller angular scales and larger multipoles .",
    "measurements of small - scale temperature fluctuations by act@xcite and spt@xcite confirm that extragalactic foregrounds will limit precision measurements of primordial temperature fluctuations to @xmath67 .",
    "even if these foregrounds could be removed , kinetic sunyaev - zeldovich ( ksz ) fluctuations would provide a limiting source of confusion that will be difficult to model and impossible to remove as it has the same spectral shape as primordial fluctuations .",
    "small - scale polarization measurements offer our best hope to probe the early universe on angular scales of @xmath68 : dusty galaxies are thought to be only @xmath69-@xmath70 polarized @xcite .",
    "we expect that secondary fluctuations should produce minimal polarization fluctuations and therefore that polarization will provide an unbeatable test for systematics .",
    "we have checked that including only polarization data from @xmath71 up to @xmath72 does not significantly change the cosmological results , again suggesting the use of high @xmath73 polarized data for checks for systematics .    .planck",
    "@xcite , actpol@xcite and cmbpol@xcite experimental specifications .",
    "channel frequency is given in ghz , fwhm in arcminutes and noise per pixel in @xmath74 for the stokes i , q and u parameters .",
    "in the analysis , we assume that beam uncertainties and foreground uncertainties are smaller than the statistical errors in each of the experiments . [ cols=\">,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as we can see from tables [ tabalpha ] and [ tabg ] , a variation in these fundamental constants has important effects for the determination of the scalar spectral index @xmath75 and the hubble costant @xmath64 .",
    "this can also be seen in the @xmath76-d likelihood contour plots in figures [ lambdag_h0 ] , [ lambdag_ns ] , [ alpha_h0 ] , and [ alpha_ns ] .",
    "in this paper we have performed a systematic analysis of the future constraints on several parameters achievable from cmb experiments . aside from the @xmath77 parameters of the standard @xmath78-cdm model we have considered new parameters mostly related to quantities which can be probed in a complementary way in the laboratory and/or with astrophysical measurements . in particular we found that the planck experiment will provide bounds on the sum of the masses @xmath79",
    "that could potentially definitively confirm or rule out the heidelberg - moscow claim for a detection of an absolute neutrino mass scale .",
    "planck+actpol could reach sufficient sensitivity for a robust detection of neutrino mass for an inverted hierarchy , while cmbpol should also be able to detect it for a direct mass hierarchy .",
    "the comparison of planck+actpol constraints on baryon density , @xmath80 and @xmath12 with the complementary bounds from bbn will provide a fundamental test for the whole cosmological scenario .",
    "cmbpol could have a very important impact in understanding the epoch of neutrino decoupling .",
    "moreover , the primordial helium abundance can be constrained with an accuracy equal to that of current astrophysical measurements but with much better control of systematics .",
    "constraints on fundamental constants can be achieved at a level close to laboratory constraints .",
    "such overlap between cosmology and other fields of physics and astronomy is one of the most interesting aspect of future cmb research .",
    "we should note , however , that our forecasts rely on several technical assumptions .",
    "first , we assumed that the theoretical model of the recombination process is accurately known .",
    "this is not quite true as corrections to the recombination process are already needed for the planck experiment ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , this is mainly a computational problem that could be solved by the time of cmbpol launch , expected not before 2015 .",
    "in addition , we assume that the foreground and beam uncertainties are smaller than the statistical errors .",
    "nevertheless , the results clearly show the advantage of adding small scale data from the act telescope to the planck satellite data . adding the former to the latter",
    "will improve the constraints by a factor @xmath81 in most of the models considered .",
