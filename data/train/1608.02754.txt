    "strongly correlated fermi systems are represented by a large variety of hf metals , insulators of new type with quantum spin liquids , quasicrystals , two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems and liquids like @xmath0 , and systems like @xmath1 with one - dimensional ( 1d ) quantum spin liquid .",
    "one can hardly expect these very different systems could exhibit a universal behavior that would allow one to view them as a new state of matter .",
    "we name these various systems hf compounds , for , as we shall see , they exhibit the behavior conforming to a type of hf metals .",
    "it is well known that three phase of matter exist : gaseous , liquid and solid , and at high enough temperatures any of these transforms into plasma - a system of chaotically moving nuclei and electrons with a gas - type behavior .",
    "surprisingly , at the lower end of the temperature scale , close to the absolute zero such multi - particle systems as hf compounds exhibit universal behavior of their thermodynamic , transport and relaxation properties , that are governed by unique quantum phase transition called the fermion condensation quantum phase transition ( fcqpt ) that creates flat bands , and leads to the specific topological state known as the fermion condensate ( fc ) . in this review",
    "we show both analytically and using arguments based entirely on the experimental grounds that all these hf compounds exhibit the universal scaling behavior formed by quasiparticles .",
    "this universal behavior , taking place at relatively low temperatures and induced by fcqpt , allows us to interpret it as the main feature of the new state of matter .",
    "thus , whatever mechanism drives the system to fcqpt , the system demonstrates the universal behavior , despite numerous mechanisms or tuning parameters present at zero temperature , such as the pressure , number density , magnetic field , chemical doping , frustration , geometrical frustration , etc .",
    "as we shall see in section [ eqp ] , at fcqpt the effective mass @xmath2 of quasiparticles diverges ; they survive fcqpt and define the thermodynamic , transport , and relaxation properties of hf compounds .",
    "thus , quasiparticles form both the main properties and the universal scaling behavior , observed in hf compounds .",
    "contrary to the landau paradigm , where quasiparticles with approximately constant effective mass @xmath2 are continuously linked with quasiparticles of non - interacting gas ,",
    "the effective mass of the above new quasiparticles formed at fcqpt strongly depends on temperature @xmath3 , magnetic field @xmath4 , pressure @xmath5 , and other external parameters . as a result",
    ", we introduce an extended quasiparticle paradigm , and show that new quasiparticles generate the non - fermi liquid ( nfl ) behavior of the physical quantities of hf compounds , that are remarkably different from those of ordinary solids or liquids described by the landau fermi liquid ( lfl ) theory .",
    "then , we briefly consider the topological properties of fc taking place beyond fcqpt , and how fcqpt generates the universal behavior of hf metals .",
    "we also discuss the experimental and pure theoretical arguments of the fc state .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in sections [ 3he ] , [ qsl ] and [ qc ] we examine the universal scaling behavior of the thermodynamic , transport and relaxation properties of hf compounds represented by 2d @xmath6he , magnets of new types with quantum spin liquid ( qsl ) and the recently discovered quasicrystals , respectively , and show that hf compounds demonstrate the new state of matter .",

    "section [ sum ] summaries the main results , placing the stress on the observation that the quantum physics of different strongly correlated fermi systems is universal and emerges regardless of their underlying microscopic details .",

    ", thus strongly stimulating the competition between phase transitions eliminating the degeneracy .",

    ", we conclude that the main contribution to the transport and thermodynamic properties comes from quasiparticles rather than the various low energy boson excitations .",
    "we note that the existence of fc has been convincingly demonstrated by purely theoretical arguments , see e.g. @xcite , and by experimental facts , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "there are different kinds of instabilities of normal fermi liquids connected with several perturbations of initial quasiparticle spectrum @xmath59 and occupation numbers @xmath76 , associated with the emergence of a multi - connected fermi surface , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "depending on the parameters and analytical properties of the landau interaction , such instabilities lead to several possible types of restructuring of the initial fermi liquid ground state .",
    "this restructuring generates topologically distinct phases .",
    "one of them is the fc , and the other belongs to a class of topological phase transitions , where the sequence of rectangles @xmath77 and @xmath78 is realized at @xmath20 , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "in fact , at elevated temperatures the systems located at these transitions exhibit behavior typical to those located at fcqpt .",
    "therefore , we do not consider the specific properties of these topological transitions , but focus on the behavior of systems located near fcqpt .",
    "it is instructive to briefly explore the behavior of @xmath2 in order to capture its universal behavior at fcqpt .",

    "we note that the second term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "is proportional to @xmath83 , and therefore eq . reduces to @xcite @xmath84 where @xmath85 is a constant . in the same way , one can calculate the change of the effective mass due to the variation of @xmath3 @xcite . for normal metals , where the electron liquid behaves like lfl with the effective mass of several bare electron masses @xmath86 , at temperatures even near 1000 k , the second term on the right hand side of eq .",

    "e.g. as soon as @xmath32 , the effective mass @xmath42 diverges and @xmath94 . in that case , the first term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "vanishes ; the second term becomes principal , and determines @xmath2 as a function of @xmath4 . in the same way , eq . becomes homogeneous , and determines @xmath95 as a universal function of temperature , magnetic field and other tuning parameters that drive the system to fcqpt . as it is seen from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( a ) and ( b ) , our observations are in accordance with the experimental facts : under the application of low magnetic fields of @xmath96 t the hf metal @xmath97 exhibits lfl behavior at @xmath98 k , while the effective mass @xmath2 is strongly dependent on both @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",

    "strongly depends on the same variables .",
    "in contrast to the landau quasiparticle paradigm that assumes approximate constancy of the effective mass , the extended quasiparticle paradigm is to be introduced .",

    "the behavior of @xmath117 , that is used to describe quantities mentioned above , is determined by momentum transfers that are small compared to momenta of the order of the reciprocal lattice length .",

    "<S> the aim of this review paper is to expose a new state of matter exhibited by strongly correlated fermi systems represented by various heavy - fermion ( hf ) metals , two - dimensional liquids like @xmath0 , compounds with quantum spin liquids , quasicrystals , and systems with one - dimensional quantum spin liquid . </S>",
    "<S> we name these various systems hf compounds , since they exhibit the behavior typical of hf metals . in hf compounds at zero temperature </S>",
    "<S> the unique phase transition , dubbed throughout as the fermion condensation quantum phase transition ( fcqpt ) can occur ; this fcqpt creates flat bands which in turn lead to the specific state , known as the fermion condensate . </S>",
    "<S> unlimited increase of the effective mass of quasiparticles signifies fcqpt ; these quasiparticles determine the thermodynamic , transport and relaxation properties of hf compounds . </S>",
    "<S> our discussion of numerous salient experimental data within the framework of fcqpt resolves the mystery of the new state of matter . </S>",
    "<S> thus , fcqpt and the fermion condensation can be considered as the universal reason for the non - fermi liquid behavior observed in various hf compounds . </S>",
    "<S> we show analytically and using arguments based completely on the experimental grounds that these systems exhibit universal scaling behavior of their thermodynamic , transport and relaxation properties . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the quantum physics of different hf compounds is universal , and emerges regardless of the microscopic structure of the compounds . </S>",
    "<S> this uniform behavior allows us to view it as the main characteristic of a new state of matter exhibited by hf compounds . </S>"
