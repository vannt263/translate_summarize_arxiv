    "at low temperatures the conductivity of a degenerated two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) is governed by quantum corrections to the drude conductivity @xmath0 . in general , these corrections have two principal origins : the weak localization ( wl ) and the electron - electron ( ) interaction @xcite . until recently our understanding of the interaction corrections to the conductivity of a 2deg was based on the seemingly unrelated theories developed for two opposite regimes : the diffusive regime@xcite @xmath1 , and the ballistic regime@xcite @xmath2 . in the diffusive regime the quasi - particle interaction time @xmath3 is larger than the momentum relaxation time @xmath4 and two interacting electrons experience multiple impurity scattering . in the ballistic regime",
    "the e - e interaction is mediated by a single impurity .",
    "recently , zala , narozhny , and aleiner ( zna ) have developed a new theory of the interaction related corrections to the conductivity @xcite that bridges the gap between the two theories known previously @xcite .",
    "one of the important conclusions of the new theory is that the interaction corrections to the conductivity in both regimes have a common origin : the coherent scattering of electrons by friedel oscillations .",
    "this can be also reformulated in terms of returns ( diffusive and ballistic ) of an electron to a spatial region which it has already visited .",
    "conformably to the previous results @xcite , the new theory predicts a logarithmic temperature dependence of the longitudinal conductivity and the hall coefficient in the diffusive regime , whereas in the ballistic regime the temperature dependence of these parameters becomes linear and @xmath5 respectively .",
    "finally a further step in the generalization of the interaction theory was realized in ref .   and ref .   who considered application of strong perpendicular magnetic fields for arbitrary type of disorder potential and influence of electron - phonon impurity scattering , respectively",
    "despite a surge of experimental activity @xcite following the publication of the theory @xcite , to our knowledge , no experiment has been reported where the crossover between the two regimes would have been clearly observed .",
    "one of the reasons is that the temperature at which the crossover is expected to occur is given by @xmath6 ( see refs .  ) . in the relatively high - mobility 2d systems that are commonly studied the crossover temperature is by far too low to be accessed experimentally ( @xmath7mk for @xmath8s ) .",
    "thus , the zna theory has to our knowledge been verified only in the intermediate and ballistic regimes @xcite ( @xmath9 ) .    to shift the crossover to higher temperatures one should use low mobility samples ( small @xmath4 ) . at the same time",
    "high carrier densities @xmath10 are necessary in order to maintain high conductivity and avoid strong localization .",
    "note that such samples were already grown and studied @xcite in the diffusive regime , but the crossover between the ballistic and diffusive regimes was not considered . in high density 2d systems",
    "the characteristic parameter @xmath11 , the ratio between coulomb energy and fermi energy is small ( @xmath12 ) and hence the effect of e - e interaction is relatively weak . in this case",
    "the zna theory @xcite predicts insulating like behavior of conductivity @xmath13 at all temperatures , whereas the `` screening '' theory @xcite predicts metallic like behavior @xmath14 in the high - temperature ballistic regime .",
    "moreover , for such small @xmath15 the fermi liquid interaction constant @xmath16 , the only parameter in the expressions for the quantum corrections to the conductivity in the theory @xcite , can be calculated explicitly .    in this respect",
    "low - mobility high - density systems appear to offer certain advantages for testing the theory @xcite , as compared to high - mobility low - density systems .",
    "indeed not only they provide an opportunity for studying an experimentally accessible temperature crossover between the diffusive and the ballistic interaction regimes but also the comparison between the theory and experiment requires no fitting parameters .",
    "also , in such systems the disorder potential is mostly due to the short - range impurities which yields almost isotropic scattering on impurities as assumed in refs .  .",
    "as shown in ref .  , the nature of disorder becomes crucially important in the ballistic regime . finally , the interaction - induced longitudinal magnetoresistance ( mr ) @xmath17 in the ballistic regime has been already studied on systems with long - range @xcite and mixed @xcite disorder , where the theoretical results of ref .",
    "have been confirmed .",
    "however , no experimental results for @xmath17 have been reported so far for low - mobility systems in the ballistic regime .",
    "the aim of the present work is to experimentally study the interaction related corrections to the conductivity , magnetoresistivity , and the hall coefficient in a broad temperature range covering both the diffusive and ballistic interaction regimes and the crossover between them .",
    "the experimental results obtained in the weak interaction limit are expected to allow for a parameter free comparison with the zna theory for both @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "we also compare our results on the mr for short - range disorder with the predictions of ref .  .",
    "the experimental samples had a 2deg formed in a narrow ( @xmath20 nm ) algaas / gaas / algaas quantum",
    "well @xmath21-doped in the middle . such doping results in a low mobility and a high carrier density .",
    "also impurities located in the layer give rise to a large - angle scattering of electrons .",
    "a detailed description of the structure can be found in ref .  .",
    "two samples from the same wafer have been studied for which similar results were obtained . here",
    "we present the data obtained for one of the samples with the following parameters at @xmath22k depending on prior illumination : the electron density @xmath23 @xmath24 and the mobility @xmath25@xmath26/vs .",
    "the hall bar shaped samples were studied between 1.4k and 110k in magnetic fields up to 15 t using a superconducting magnet and a vti cryostat and also a flow cryostat ( @xmath27k ) placed in a 20 t resistive magnet .",
    "the data was acquired via a standard four - terminal lock - in technique with the current @xmath28na .",
    "[ figure1 ] shows the longitudinal and hall resistances of the sample as a function of magnetic field at temperatures up to 110k . as can be seen both are strongly temperature dependent . before analyzing the role of the quantum corrections in the behavior of the transport coefficients shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] , let us estimate the possible contribution from other unrelated temperature dependent factors .",
    "first , since the measurements were performed up to relatively high temperatures , the question of the role of phonon scattering becomes important . in this connection",
    "we believe that the following argument can be used .",
    "it is well known that in ultra - clean gaas samples sufficiently high values of mobility are reported even at liquid nitrogen temperatures ( see , for example ref .  , where @xmath29 @xmath26/vs at @xmath30k ) .",
    "at these temperature the phonon scattering is the dominant scattering mechanism in these samples and yet the mobilities are still a thousand times larger than in our sample . in our experiment ,",
    "the pure electron - phonon contribution to the conductivity is thus negligible compared to impurity scattering .",
    "recently a theory of the interplay between electron - phonon and impurity scattering was developed@xcite .",
    "it was argued that these interference effects might play a significant role at intermediate temperatures .",
    "however , we have evaluated the phonon contribution to be a few percent of the drude conductivity at 100k .",
    "also our estimates show that this contribution is still smaller than the e - e interaction one . for these reasons",
    "the effect of phonons can be neglected in the entire experimental temperature range in these samples .",
    "now , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] , the hall coefficient varies with @xmath31 at low temperatures but remains practically constant for @xmath32k .",
    "one might argue that the behavior at low temperatures could be due to a variation of the electron density with temperature .",
    "however , we believe that this is not the case . indeed , from the measurements carried out up to 20 t where the shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) oscillations are better resolved , we find that the density remains constant at @xmath33k . also we find that the density given by the sdh oscillations is the same as we get from the slope of the hall resistance at @xmath32k where it is @xmath31-independent .",
    "we conclude therefore that the electron density remains constant in the entire experimental temperature range and all the data presented in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] corresponds to @xmath34 @xmath24 .",
    "having excluded the phonon scattering and the density variation as possible causes of the behavior shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] we associate the observed temperature dependencies with the quantum corrections to the transport coefficients .",
    "our data will be analyzed in the framework of the recent theories @xcite valid for a degenerated 2deg ( @xmath35 ) . according to ref .",
    "only one subband is occupied in our quantum wells at @xmath34 @xmath24 .",
    "also @xmath36k and so the theory @xcite should apply under our experimental conditions .",
    "the longitudinal conductivity is a sum of three components : the drude conductivity , the wl contribution and the e - e interaction correction .",
    "for the correct evaluation of the interaction related correction at @xmath37  t , the knowledge of the first two contributions to the conductivity is essential .",
    "unfortunately , in our case there is no direct means of knowing the value of the drude conductivity @xmath38 because of a considerable ( up to @xmath39 ) variation of the zero field conductivity with temperature . on the other hand , to single out the e - e interaction correction we have to eliminate the weak localization contribution , which might be stronger than the interaction correction at @xmath37 .",
    "the wl correction to the conductivity at low temperatures and magnetic fields is described by a well - known expression  @xcite involving digamma functions . however , at high enough temperatures and/or magnetic fields ( when the contribution of non - diffusive paths becomes more and more pronounced ) the wl correction is given by a rather complicated analytical expression  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there exists a method ( see the next section ) that can be used for the evaluation of all the three contributions to the conductivity at zero magnetic field basing on the knowledge of the high - b behavior of the magnetoconductivity .",
    "this method has the advantage that one can forgo the usual procedure of fitting the low field data with the theoretical expressions for the wl magnetoresistance@xcite , thus eliminating a possible source of error at this stage .",
    "a general formula for the conductivity tensor in a magnetic field can be derived using the quantum kinetic equation of ref .  .",
    "the longitudinal and the hall conductivities can be written for @xmath35 in the following form  @xcite @xmath40 generally , the zero-@xmath41 drude conductivity @xmath42 depends on @xmath31 due to the interaction - induced renormalization of both the transport scattering time @xmath43 and the fermi velocity @xmath44 . strictly speaking",
    ", the cyclotron frequency @xmath45 also depends on @xmath31 via the renormalization of the effective mass @xmath46 ; however , it appears in ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq1-xy ] ) only in combination @xmath47 so that one can absorb its renormalization into the @xmath31-dependence of the effective scattering time . while the first terms in ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq1-xy ] ) have the structure of the classical drude conductivity in a finite @xmath41 , the terms @xmath48 and @xmath49 appear as quantum corrections to the drude terms .",
    "the expressions ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq1-xy ] ) are justified under the condition @xmath50 which allows one to neglect sdh oscillations in the present case of short - range impurity potential .",
    "the same condition governs the strength of the influence of magnetic field on the collision integral in the kinetic equation  @xcite and allows one to neglect cyclotron returns to the same impurity . under this condition ,",
    "the bending of relevant electron trajectories by the magnetic field is weak .",
    "it is taken into account by a proper definition of the the @xmath41-independent quantities @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 and @xmath54 this makes it possible  @xcite to extract the interaction - induced corrections to the conductivity at @xmath37 from the magnetoconductivity obtained in relatively strong magnetic fields , see section  [ method ] .",
    "the condition ( [ sdho ] ) is fulfilled in the whole range of relevant @xmath31 and @xmath41 we address in this work .",
    "the term @xmath55 in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) corresponds to the `` diffusive '' contribution of e - e interactions , which is due to the coherent processes involving multiple impurity scattering events . in the diffusive regime",
    ", @xmath55 diverges logarithmically  @xcite with decreasing @xmath31 , @xmath56 [ we note in passing that , in contrast to eqs .",
    "( [ zna - delta - sigma - c ] ) and ( [ zna - delta - sigma - t ] ) below , this logarithmic contribution is cut off by @xmath57 rather than by @xmath58 . at high temperatures the contribution of diffusive paths",
    "is expected to vanish , since the probability of `` diffusive '' returns involving more than one impurity - scattering is suppressed in the ballistic regime ( each additional impurity scattering yields an extra factor @xmath59 ) . in effect , the term @xmath55 in ( [ eq1 ] ) also takes into account the influence of the magnetic field on the return probability determining the correction to the @xmath31-dependent part of the effective transport time , see discussion in ref .  .",
    "this contribution to @xmath55 dominates in the ballistic regime . as for the term @xmath60 in eq .",
    "( [ eq1-xy ] ) , the contribution of diffusive paths to it is exactly zero  @xcite , so that this term is completely determined by the influence of the magnetic field on the collision integral .",
    "therefore , in the diffusive regime @xmath60 has no logarithmic divergency  @xcite , unlike @xmath55 .",
    "taking into account the e - e interaction effects related to the scattering on a single impurity results in the @xmath31-dependent renormalization @xcite of @xmath43 .",
    "the @xmath31-dependence of @xmath42 in the ballistic limit is dominated by the @xmath31-dependence of @xmath43 since the interaction - induced correction to the fermi velocity yields a weaker @xmath31-dependence .",
    "thus , in the ballistic limit the linear - in-@xmath31 interaction correction to the zero-@xmath41 conductivity  @xcite enters eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) only via the renormalized transport scattering time @xmath43 in the first term ( both in the numerator and the denominator ) .",
    "the terms @xmath61 and @xmath62 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq1-xy ] ) are the wl corrections to the longitudinal and hall conductivities , respectively .",
    "actually , the wl corrections arise solely from the renormalization of the transport scattering time  @xcite and hence they can be completely absorbed into the first `` classical '' terms in ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq1-xy ] ) via the @xmath41-dependent correction to @xmath43 .",
    "a general method for the analysis of the magnetotransport data is based on eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq1-xy ] ) . for",

    "( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq1-xy ] ) that @xmath66 this equation allows one to find the values of @xmath43 from the slope of @xmath64 vs @xmath67 dependence .",

    "a detailed analysis of the magnetoconductivity based on this procedure will be published elsewhere  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will concentrate on the zero-@xmath41 interaction - induced correction to @xmath69 for this purpose a simpler fitting procedure described in section  [ method ] is sufficient .",
    "let us describe how the experimental quantum corrections were extracted from the row data and then turn to the analysis of the obtained corrections .",
    "the main idea of our method is to use the mr and hall data obtained in a relatively _ strong magnetic field _",
    ", where the weak localization is suppressed , to find the value of interaction - induced corrections in the limit of _ zero magnetic field_.    with the magnetic field increasing , the mr in fig .",
    "[ figure1]a goes through two distinct types of behavior . an abrupt drop of resistance at low fields and then a much weaker magnetic field dependence at higher @xmath41 .",

    "we conclude therefore that the strong mr observed at low fields can be associated with the wl suppression in our samples and that the mr observed at higher fields must be attributed entirely to the e - e interaction effects @xcite .    as a first step of our procedure ,",
    "the experimental values of the longitudinal and hall conductivities are obtained by inverting the resistivity tensor using the data shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "the result for the longitudinal conductivity is shown in fig .",

    "the weak localization correction dominates at low fields but is suppressed at @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , at @xmath74 the shape of the @xmath18 vs @xmath41 dependence should be determined by the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "the term @xmath55 , which is @xmath41-independent , should only result in a vertical shift of this contribution . at low temperatures",
    "we experimentally find that with the wl suppressed at higher magnetic fields the mc corresponding to different temperatures forms parallel vertically shifted traces ( see fig .",

    "( [ eq1 ] ) . within this procedure",
    ", we attribute the @xmath31-dependence of @xmath42 solely to the @xmath31-dependence of @xmath43 , using @xmath76 this amounts to treating all the interaction - induced corrections to the collision integral related to @xmath42 as the renormalization of the effective transport scattering time .",
    "further , we assume that the @xmath31-dependence of the product @xmath77 in the classical terms in ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq1-xy ] ) is the same as the @xmath31-dependence of @xmath42 .",

    "once fitted for @xmath78 t , the term @xmath80 was then extrapolated for each of the curves down to @xmath37 ( see fig .  [ figure2 ] ) .",
    "we believe that the value @xmath81 obtained at @xmath37 is free of the @xmath31-dependent wl contribution  @xcite .    finally , the temperature independent term @xmath38 was subtracted from @xmath82 at all temperatures .",

    "the second ( constant ) term is the contribution of @xmath42 . in the ballistic regime @xmath55",

    "as suggested by zna  @xcite we used : @xmath94 in the first line of @xmath95 ( this form reflects the backscattering character of e - e interaction related to friedel oscillations ) and @xmath96 in the second line so that no additional fitting parameter has been introduced .",

    "( [ eq2]),([zna - delta - sigma - c ] ) , and ( [ zna - delta - sigma - t ] ) , as well as the experimental data points . as can be seen , there is a systematic shift of the experimental points with respect to the theoretical curve .",
    "this shift can be explained by the fact that zna theory describes only the temperature dependence of the conductivity but not the magnitude of the total interaction - induced contribution .",
    "firstly , in addition to the correction @xmath98 given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , ( [ zna - delta - sigma - c ] ) , and ( [ zna - delta - sigma - t ] ) , there is a large @xmath31-independent interaction - induced contribution to conductivity which is due to the @xmath31-independent part of the renormalization ( screening ) of impurities by friedel oscillations [ see eq .",
    "( 3.33 ) of ref .  ] . for @xmath99",
    "this contribution is of the same order in magnitude as the value of the drude conductivity of a noninteracting electron gas , while for @xmath100 it contains an additional factor @xmath101 .",
    "however , in the presence of interactions this contribution can not be experimentally separated from the noninteracting part of the drude conductivity . therefore , the value of @xmath38 used in eq .",
    "( [ difference ] ) already takes into account this screening - induced term , so that the observed shift can not be explained in this way .",
    "secondly , the logarithmic terms in ( [ zna - delta - sigma - c ] ) and ( [ zna - delta - sigma - t ] ) yield a @xmath31-independent contribution which depends on the ultraviolet cutoff .",

    "( [ zna - delta - sigma - c ] ) and ( [ zna - delta - sigma - t ] ) only due to the contribution of @xmath42 ( this fact becomes important in a finite magnetic field ) .",
    "it follows that , similarly to the linear - in-@xmath102 term discussed above , the @xmath31-independent term @xmath103 is also already absorbed in @xmath38 when the latter is found from the analysis of the mr data .",

    "[ figure3 ] which we believe to reveal important information . indeed , the total correction to the conductivity is the sum of @xmath48 and a ballistic contribution which is proportional to @xmath43 .",
    "as can be seen the logarithmic diffusive part vanishes at @xmath32k when the ballistic part starts to vary linearly with temperature .",
    "therefore we believe that fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] establishes a crossover from the diffusive to the ballistic limit in the behavior of the interaction - induced correction to the zero-@xmath41 conductivity .",
    "this change of behavior is observed at @xmath104k .",
    "this is in a qualitative agreement with the zna theory , predicting the crossover to occur at @xmath105 which corresponds in our case to @xmath106k .",
    "finally , not only fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] shows that the scattering time effectively varies linearly with temperature at high temperature @xcite but it also shows that the sign of the variation is positive ( i.e. insulating like ) .",
    "it is due to the fact that at small @xmath15 the exchange ( singlet ) contribution is more important than hartree ( triplet ) contribution @xcite .",
    "while predicted by zna theory at low interaction this behavior is not allowed by the screening theory@xcite which does not take into account the exchange part in the calculation of the corrections .",
    "we now turn to the analysis of the hall data presented in figure .  [ figure1]b . according to ref .",
    "the hall resistivity may be written as : @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the classical hall resistivity and @xmath109 are the corrections in the charge and triplet channel .",
    "these corrections are given as follows : @xmath110 @xmath111 the detailed expression for @xmath112 can be found in ref .",
    ", @xmath113 and the value of @xmath108 is obtained from the high temperature curves for which @xmath114 . therefore according to the theory of the e - e interaction @xcite one",

    "figure  [ figure5 ] shows how this prediction works in our case .    a simple calculation ( carried out without any attempt at fitting the experiment ) results in the dashed curve ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "this prediction is compared with the experimental correction ( black dots ) . at each",
    "temperatures the hall coefficient was obtained by linearly fitting the experimental curves shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1]b . the corresponding range of magnetic field satisfies @xmath118 which allowed us to neglect the finite-@xmath41 corrections to eqs .",
    "( [ eq3])-([eq4 t ] ) in our analysis . as shown in ref .",

    "obtained in the limit @xmath120 in a rather wide range of @xmath41 .    on the whole , there is a qualitative agreement between theory and experiment but the quantitative agreement is lacking .",
    "using @xmath16 as a fitting parameter does not improve the agreement .",
    "nevertheless we have found , that if the coefficient @xmath121 is replaced by @xmath122 , then the theoretical curve ( the solid line ) fits the experimental dependence quite well .",
    "this result might be related to an anisotropy of electron scattering in the sample which reduces the electron return probability and so weakens the correction at low fields ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "the reduction of the pre - factor @xmath124 could just be the way in which this anisotropy reveals itself since the correction is proportional to @xmath124 in the ballistic limit .",
    "it is worth noting , that in the ballistic regime the correction to the hall coefficient is more sensitive to the anisotropy of impurity scattering than the leading correction to the longitudinal conductivity .",
    "this is because the relevant processes giving rise to @xmath125 involve at least three impurity scattering events , while those leading to the linear - in-@xmath31 correction to @xmath18 involve a single backscattering .",
    "clearly , each large - angle scattering event yields a reduction factor even for the weak anisotropy of scattering .",
    "+ finally , in fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] we show the experimental data points for the transverse conductivity tensor as a function of magnetic field ( fig .  [ figure6]a ) and as function of temperature for two different values of magnetic field ( fig .",
    "[ figure6]b ) .",
    "the conductivity is observed to be temperature independent at low temperatures and vary linearly with temperature at high temperatures . while conform to the theoretical prediction in the diffusive regime ( @xmath126 and @xmath127 , according to ref .  ) , the behavior at high temperatures is less obvious .",
    "however , this behavior follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq1-xy ] ) which takes into account the ballistic renormalization of the scattering time .",
    "the measured values of the hall conductivity are indeed well compared to values of @xmath128 calculated using the simple drude - like formula : @xmath129 in this formula we neglected terms @xmath49 and @xmath130 from eq .",
    "( [ eq1-xy ] ) and used eq .",
    "( [ sigmad ] ) for @xmath42 . to evaluate @xmath131 we used the values of the scattering time shown in fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] .",
    "again the data are well described by the model which includes no fitting parameter .",
    "note that we also calculated the expected field dependence at @xmath132k [ see dotted curve in ( fig .",
    "[ figure6]a ) ] which also reproduced well the experimental data . a more detailed analysis of the hall conductivity within the general method outlined in sec .",
    "[ background ] [ taking into account all the terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq1-xy ] ) ] will be presented elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "let us return to the analysis of the longitudinal resistivity @xmath133 shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "this analysis is aimed to obtain a consistent description including all the transport coefficients , @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 , and @xmath136 .",
    "furthermore , the behavior of @xmath133 in the ballistic regime is determined by more subtle effects as compared to the behavior of the conductivity tensor .",
    "it turns out that in the longitudinal mr , unlike in the conductivity components , the leading @xmath41-independent e - e correction to @xmath4 cancels out .",
    "in fact , the @xmath31 dependence of @xmath133 reflects the weak influence of magnetic field on the collision integral in the quantum kinetic equation of ref .  .",
    "as discussed in sec .",
    "[ method ] , the low-@xmath41 part of the curves is dominated by the wl - induced mr , while the mr for @xmath73 is governed by the interaction effect . in the diffusive regime @xmath137 ,",
    "the interaction  induced resistivity correction , @xmath138\\right)\\nonumber \\\\ & \\times &   \\ln \\left(\\hbar\\over k_b t\\tau\\right ) \\label{mraa}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( @xmath139 is the classical drude resistivity ) , gives rise to a parabolic mr @xmath140 in arbitrary magnetic field  @xcite .    in the ballistic regime , as shown in ref .  ,",
    "the interaction  induced mr remains quadratic in magnetic field , while the @xmath31 behavior of the proportionality coefficient depends on the type of disorder .",
    "in the present case of short - ranged impurities , ref .   predicts the following ballistic ( @xmath141 ) asymptotic behavior of the mr for @xmath142 : @xmath143 where the function @xmath144 describes the contribution of the triplet channel .",
    "it is worth stressing that in high - density systems with @xmath100 ( i.e. for @xmath145 ) , the parabolic mr is dominated by the contribution of the singlet channel and hence is negative .",
    "equations ( [ mraa ] ) and ( [ rho - xx - ball ] ) can be obtained by inverting the conductivity tensor given by eqs .",
    "( [ sigma_xx_no_wl ] ) and ( [ eq5 ] ) .",
    "one can see that the classical part of the conductivity tensor [ i.e. eq .  ( [ eq5 ] ) and the first term in eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ sigma_xx_no_wl ] ) ] does not yield @xmath41 dependence of the resistivity , even when the interaction effects are taken into account through the @xmath31 dependence of @xmath43 . indeed , neglecting the term @xmath48 one gets @xmath146 which is independent of @xmath41 .",
    "thus the mr is solely generated by the term @xmath55 .",
    "we remind the reader that in the ballistic regime @xmath55 appears to be dominated by the effect of magnetic field on the collision integral , see sec .",
    "[ background ] .",
    "thus , we conclude that the main source of the mr for @xmath147k is the weak @xmath41 dependence of the transport scattering time .",
    "let us now compare our experimental data with the above theoretical predictions .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the comparison is again parameter free .",
    "figure  [ figure7 ] presents the longitudinal resistivity as a function of @xmath148 .",
    "it shows that the mr is indeed parabolic and negative .",
    "the slope of the curves @xmath149 vs @xmath148 was obtained in the relevant ranges @xmath150 for the curves corresponding to @xmath151k and for @xmath152 for @xmath32k .",
    "this has allowed us to reduce the influence of wl in the high @xmath31 data and the sdh oscillations in the low @xmath31 data .",
    "the slope of these lines is presented in figure [ figure8 ] .",
    "the error in the determination of the slope due to the choice of the evaluation range was estimated from the deviations obtained using the interval @xmath153 of @xmath148 for the linear fit . in fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] we have extrapolated the mr lines to the region of higher magnetic fields @xmath154 . from this plot we again clearly see the crossover between the diffusive and the ballistic regimes which occurs at @xmath104k . indeed the lines for @xmath151k intersect each other at a single point close to @xmath155 , as predicted by the diffusive expression ( [ mraa ] ) . as follows from eq .",
    "( [ mraa ] ) , at the intersection point the quantum correction to the longitudinal resistivity is zero , so that the value of @xmath149 at this point corresponds to the classical drude value of the resistivity : @xmath156 this value of @xmath157 was used in sec .",
    "[ method ] to find the magnitude of the interaction - induced conductivity correction at @xmath37 . for higher temperatures ( @xmath32k ) , the mr lines in fig .",
    "7 no longer intersect each other at a single point . at this point",
    "the system enters the crossover region , where the @xmath31-dependence of @xmath42 starts to become important .    the proportionality coefficient of @xmath149 vs @xmath148 dependence is compared in fig .",
    "[ figure8 ] to the theoretical asymptotics given by eqs .",
    "( [ mraa ] ) and ( [ rho - xx - ball ] ) . in ( [ mraa ] )",
    "we used the `` diffusive '' value @xmath117 given by eq .",
    "( [ f - diff ] ) . in eq .",
    "( [ rho - xx - ball ] ) we used @xmath158 with @xmath159 given by eq .",
    "( [ f - ball ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with the above observation that the `` ballistic '' mr is mostly due to the @xmath41-dependent corrections to the collision integral .",

    "the experimental data is found for both diffusive and ballistic temperature regimes .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a study aiming at observing the crossover from the diffusive to the ballistic regime in the weak interaction limit .",
    "we find strong evidences of such crossover in the obtained measurements .",
    "we realized a parameter free comparison of our experimental data for the longitudinal conductivity and hall coefficient to the recent zna theory as well as the longitudinal resistivity to the theory of ref .  .",
