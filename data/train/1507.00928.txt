    "[ figdecohnumerics ] . the dephasing algorithm described here",
    "is inspired by the concept of einselection ( `` environment - induced superselection '' ) pioneered by w. zurek @xcite , which is a mechanism proposed to understand the influence of dephasing on quantum systems and , more generally , to explain the quantum - to - classical transition . according to einselection",
    ", the interaction of an open system with its environment leads to decoherence , which causes a decay of the quantum states of the system into an incoherent mixture of so - called pointer states .",
    "this strongly suppresses quantum interference effects between different pointer states on the time scale of the dephasing time @xmath22 .",
    "the character of the set of pointer states , the pointer basis , heavily depends on the environment and the coupling to it .",
    "for example , for very weak coupling to the environment , the pointer basis coincides with the set of energy eigenstates of the system .",
    "however , in the case of an intermediate system - environment coupling based on a local interaction , e.  g. , in the case of electron - phonon or electron - electron coupling , it is expected to be a set of states that is localized in phase space , i.  e. , in position and momentum .    as in the puddle lifetime calculations",
    ", we again employ a numerical time evolution based on a single pure state , i.  e. , we do not use a representation in terms of density matrices , which would drastically increase the computational effort .",
    "still , we incorporate the dephasing - induced interference suppression by occasionally ( partially ) randomizing the phases of the components of the state vector in a representation that tries to faithfully mimic a decomposition in terms of the pointer basis .",
    "this randomization is done at fixed event times @xmath45 , which are sampled from an exponential distribution with time constant @xmath46 , i.  e. , we assume the events to be fully uncorrelated ( poisson process ) . in between these events , the propagation is done fully coherently using the propagator based on a polynomial expansion mentioned above .",
    "the decomposition and the subsequent randomization is done in the following way : at the time of an event @xmath45 , we extract a set of pseudo eigenstates , @xmath47 at the energies @xmath48 using a short - time propagation of the wave packet @xmath41 around the time @xmath45 .",
    "these states fulfill the requirement that they are both local in energy as well as in position space ( as they are extracted from a propagation over a finite time interval ) .",
    "the degree of localization in position space can by tuned by the propagation time @xmath49 , and a matching set of energies , this approach yields the expected pointer basis in the limit of very weak coupling to the environment : the exact energy eigenstates of the system . ]",
    "which we choose @xmath50 .",
    "we use these states @xmath51 to spectrally decompose the current state before the event @xmath52 , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ figdecoposition ] .",
    "for this , we first orthogonalize them with a gram - schmidt process , leading to the set @xmath53",
    ". then , we calculate the weights @xmath54 , which can be used to express the current state as the decomposition @xmath55 since the set of 11 states is not sufficient to describe the wave packet @xmath52 exactly , we also allow for account a small residual part @xmath56 . in this decomposed representation",
    ", the dephasing can be easily added by modifying the set of amplitudes to @xmath57 with the random numbers @xmath58 $ ] .",
    "subsequently , we create the new wave packet @xmath59 which is used in the following propagation . with this dephasing algorithm , we are able to calculate the time evolution in arbitrary mesoscopic systems .",
    "it roughly conserves the energy , the spatial extent , as well as the total spin of the wave packet , which is what one would expect from the interaction with a spin - unpolarized ( non - magnetic ) environment .",
    "the strength of a single dephasing event can be tuned by the degree of randomization of the phase in each event , i.  e. , by the parameter @xmath60 .",
    "this also makes the regime of weak but frequent dephasing accessible ( compared to the regime of rare and very strong dephasing which allows a simpler model treatment discussed in the first part of the manuscript ) . however , to compare with the experimentally accessible dephasing time @xmath22 , which is the time for full phase coherence loss , one has to find the relation between the time constant of the events @xmath46 and the time for full dephasing @xmath22 .",
    "this can be done in the following way : the average correlation of a state in the pointer basis @xmath61 with itself after @xmath62 events is given by , @xmath63 with the chance for @xmath62 events occurring after time @xmath64 in a poisson process , @xmath65 one can evaluate the average decay of autocorrelation after time @xmath64 , @xmath66\\nonumber \\\\ = \\ , & \\exp\\left[-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{e}}}\\left(1-\\frac{\\sin\\left(\\pi q\\right)}{\\pi q}\\right)\\right]=\\exp\\left[-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{\\phi}}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath67 yielding the desired relation between decoherence time @xmath22 and the time constant of the events @xmath46 .",
    "to model the frequent but weak dephasing regime , we use @xmath68 , thus , @xmath69 .    in fig .",
    "[ figdecohnumerics ] , we apply the dephasing scheme on three different electrostatic puddle shapes to show how the coupling between the puddle and the edge states affects the total spin randomization of the puddle in presence of dephasing . a video of a sample propagation can be also found online @xcite ."
