    "the demixing behavior of hard - core three - dimensional additive mixtures composed of particles without orientational degrees of freedom , in particular the hard - sphere and parallel hard - cube systems , has been recently studied in depth by several authors using monte carlo simulation techniques @xcite and theory @xcite .",
    "the main conclusions that can be drawn from these studies is that fluid - fluid demixing is always metastable with respect to fluid - solid demixing for asymmetric mixtures in which the solid phase is composed of big particles and the fluid phase is enriched in small particles ( demixing behavior similar to the one found in mixtures of parallel hard cubes on a cubic lattice @xcite ) .",
    "the physics behind this demixing behavior is known as the depletion effect @xcite , and can be explained as the effective attraction between two large particles due to the uncompensated osmotic pressure exerted by the small particles when the two excluded volumes between big and small particles overlap .",
    "thus in the demixed phases enriched by each of the species the accessible volumes to the particles is maximized and as a consequence the total configurational entropy is increased .",
    "three - dimensional mixtures of additive anisotropic particles possess a demixing behavior which differs from that of mixtures composed of isotropic particles because of the presence of particle orientational degrees of freedom .",
    "it has been shown that demixing strongly depends on the shape of the particles ( spherical , oblate or prolate ) @xcite and for a particular geometry , on its aspect ratio ( the ratio between the characteristic lengths of particles ) @xcite .",
    "for example , one of the demixed phases can be an oriented phase , i.e. , a nematic ( n ) phase where the particles are aligned on average along the nematic director .",
    "it is easy to predict the most common demixing scenario , it will proceed between a n phase composed of the longer particles and an isotropic ( i ) phase composed of the short - particle component . in this case",
    "the excluded volume between the large particles is minimized by their parallel alignment .",
    "i - i and n - n demixing was also found in mixtures of anisotropic particles @xcite , showing that fluid - fluid demixing is a common scenario in these mixtures , which has recently been confirmed experimentally @xcite .    the scaled particle theory ( spt ) was initially developed for hard spheres @xcite and later extended to anisotropic particles @xcite .",
    "the usual formulation of spt for mixtures of hard convex bodies restricted to the isotropic orientational phase has as a main ingredient the expression for the second virial coefficients as a function of the volumes , surface areas , and mean curvatures of hard convex bodies @xcite . this exact result obtained in the 1950 s @xcite",
    "was used to show that in two dimensions i - i demixing is not allowed @xcite , the gain in accessible volume after demixing is much lower in two dimensions , which explains the stability of mixtures with respect to i - i demixing at any composition .",
    "this result has been confirmed by other theories constructed from the expression of the direct correlation function in terms of the geometric measures of the particles @xcite , in the same spirit as the fundamental measure theory ( fmt ) for hard spheres @xcite .",
    "some authors have studied the possibility of demixing in a mixture of perfectly oriented two - dimensional additive particles @xcite , arriving at the same conclusion , the mixture is always stable .",
    "however , in contrast to these findings , we will show in section iii that the spt approximation does predict n - n demixing in the limit of parallel alignment .",
    "also , the previous negative results can not be taken as definite , since the suppression of orientational fluctuations is a crude approximation to study the possibility of n - n demixing , so that the question about the existence of demixing ( i - n or n - n ) in two dimensions is still open .",
    "note that we explicitly distinguish i - n demixing from the usual orientational i - n phase transition .",
    "the reason for this will be explained later in sec .",
    "iv c.    as opposed to additive mixtures , nonadditive mixtures of hard disks can demix , as was shown by several authors @xcite .",
    "this result is not surprising since the demixed phases , composed of practically the same kind of species , are approximately additive and , as a consequence , have less excluded volumes between any pair of particles compared to the mixed state .",
    "nonadditive mixtures made up of anisotropic particles have not been analyzed so far .",
    "the coupling between nonadditiveness in the interactions and orientational degrees of freedom is expected to give rise to interesting phenomenology , which is worth investigating .",
    "we will not pursue these aspects in the present paper .",
    "the purpose of this work is to shed light on the question about the existence of i - n or n - n demixing in two - dimensional mixtures of additive hard anisotropic particles .",
    "we have used the spt formalism specified for a mixture of hard rectangles ( hr ) and hard discorectangles ( hdr ) , and applied a bifurcation analysis from the isotropic phase to find the possibility of i - n demixing .",
    "this analysis has been shown to be useful in the study of phase transitions with symmetry breaking .",
    "in particular it was used to study the i - n transition in two dimensions in a one - component system of hard needles @xcite , and in a system composed of self - assembled rods @xcite in the same two - dimensional onsager limit . using the bifurcation analysis ,",
    "we have found that , even for a system of hdr ( where the i - n transition is continuous in the one - component limit , as indicated by simulation @xcite and density - functional theory @xcite ) the mixture can demix in two phases of different composition .",
    "in addition , we have calculated the phase diagrams of different mixtures of hdr and confirmed this demixing scenario . in some mixtures",
    "we have also found a n - n phase separation which ends in a critical point , as well as a triple coexistence between an i phase and two different nematics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present the theoretical model , and in sec .",
    "iii the bifurcation analysis .",
    "the results from this analysis are shown for hdr in sec .",
    "iv a , for hr in sec .",
    "iv b , and a check using a very simple model ( zwanzig approximation ) is presented in sec .",
    "iv c. section v shows the results from the calculations of the phase diagrams of hdr mixtures . finally some conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "the key quantity in the development of the spt for a mixture of hard convex bodies in two dimensions ( see ref.@xcite ) is the averaged ( over all possible orientations of a fluid particle of species @xmath0 ) excluded area between an inserted scaled particle @xmath1 with orientation @xmath2 ( measured from the nematic director ) and a fluid particle of species @xmath0 with orientation @xmath3 , i.e. , @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the length and width of the scaled particle , @xmath7 is the orientational distribution function of species @xmath0 and @xmath8 the relative angle between the axes of particles @xmath1 and @xmath0 . the superindex @xmath9 labels the nature of the particle , either hard rectangles ( @xmath10 ) or hard discorectangles ( @xmath11 ) . the excluded area between two rectangles ( @xmath1 and @xmath0 ) is @xmath12 for hard discorectangles @xmath13 where for hr @xmath14 is the area of species @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) while for hdr @xmath17 .",
    "the reversible work required to insert the scaled particle with fixed orientation coincides with the excess chemical potential and , in the limit of small sizes ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 for any @xmath0 ) , it has the following asymptotic form @xcite : @xmath20,\\hspace*{0.2cm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the density of species @xmath0 and the sum runs over all species . in the opposite limit of large sizes ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) this work coincides with the thermodynamic work required to open a cavity of area @xmath24 , which is equal to @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the fluid pressure .",
    "the spt interpolates between both limits using a taylor expansion of the function @xmath27 around the value @xmath28 .",
    "the second term of this expansion is fixed to @xmath29 .",
    "finally , all the particle lengths are taken to be those of any one of the species , say @xmath0 , which results in @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the total packing fraction and @xmath32 .",
    "the excess chemical potential of species @xmath0 is the angular average @xmath33=-\\ln(1-\\eta)\\nonumber \\\\&+ & \\frac{\\sum_{\\tau}\\rho_{\\tau}\\langle \\langle v^{(0)}_{\\nu\\tau } \\rangle\\rangle } { 1-\\eta}+\\beta p v_{\\nu } , \\label{pote}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 means the following double angular average : @xmath35    integrating the thermodynamic relations @xmath36 with the use of eq .",

    "the functional minimization of @xmath46 with respect to the @xmath47 allows , as usual , to find the equilibrium distribution functions and correspondingly the equilibrium free energy of the mixture .",
    "the above theoretical scheme will be used in the following section to develop a bifurcation analysis of i - n demixing for hdr and hr .",
    "also it will be used to calculate the phase diagram of mixtures . in order to do that we need to fix the fluid pressure , which means that the composition of one of the species and the total fluid density are no longer independent variables .",
    "once the independent variable is chosen , the dependent variable can be calculated through the constant pressure criterion .",
    "thus , the adequate thermodynamic potential to work with is the gibbs free energy per particle in reduced units @xmath48 .",
    "the minimization of @xmath49 with respect to the order parameters ( in the case of the nematic phase ) , the condition of constant pressure and the double tangent construction on @xmath50 with respect to the composition of one of the species , allows us to calculate the coexistence condition between different phases . changing the pressure and repeating the above steps we have found the phase diagrams of different binary mixtures .",
    "the usual bifurcation analysis for a one - component fluid with symmetry breaking includes ( i ) an order parameter expansion of the free energy around the bifurcation point ; ( ii ) the calculation of the inverse isothermal compressibility of the ordered phase at the same point .",
    "the order of the phase transition can be elucidated by the combined use of both criteria , the sign of the free - energy difference between the ordered and disordered phases , already minimized with respect to the order parameter , and the sign of the isothermal compressibility of the ordered phase , evaluated at bifurcation .",
    "if the system exhibits a tricritical point , its location can be obtained from the vanishing of either the first coefficient in the expansion of the free - energy difference or the isothermal compressibility , depending on which of them occurs first @xcite .    for binary mixtures fluid - fluid",
    "demixing without symmetry breaking is usually calculated from the vanishing of the determinant of the matrix with elements @xmath51 which means that the stability of the mixture with respect to volume and composition fluctuations is violated .",
    "this allows us to obtain the demixing spinodal .",
    "however , in a symmetry - breaking transition the above matrix should be calculated from the minimized free - energy of the ordered phase using the order - parameter expansion up to the order required .",
    "this criterion is equivalent to the loss of convexity of the gibbs free energy per particle of the ordered phase with respect to the mixture composition at the bifurcation point .",
    "since our aim is the study of i - n demixing , which involves an orientational symmetry breaking , we will implement the latter scheme .    a fourier - series decomposition of the orientational distribution functions @xmath52 should retain only even harmonics , due to the symmetry of the particles studied here [ @xmath53 . in the neighborhood of the i -",

    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "( iii ) the demixing regions for hr mixture are in general wider as compared to those of hdr .",
    "let us discuss the behavior of the pressure , using fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) and , as an example , the case @xmath124 and @xmath189 .",
    "this behavior is similar to that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for the hdr model , namely the pressure is a monotonically decreasing function of composition . also there are two points obtained from the intersection of the vertical line at @xmath190 and the boundaries of the shaded region ( the upper one on the solid line and the other on the lower branch of the dashed line ) .",
    "these in principle would correspond to tricritical points as in the case of hdr .",
    "the point corresponding to a lower pressure ( higher composition ) is a genuine tricritical point while the other one might be inside i - n@xmath147 or i - n@xmath138 demixing regions .      this simple model , as applied to hr , allows the calculation of the phase diagram without any parametrization because the orientational distribution function can be taken as @xmath191\\delta(\\phi)+ \\left[\\left(1-q_{\\mu}\\right)/2\\right]\\delta(\\phi-\\pi/2)$ ] [ @xmath192 is the dirac delta function ] , corresponding to a binary mixture of two species with perpendicular orientations .",
    "thus , the excess part of the free energy is a second degree polynomial of the order parameters @xmath193 ( with @xmath194 ) , and the minimization of the total free energy requires to solve two transcendental equations to find their equilibrium values .",
    "since no parametrization is necessary , the location of all tricritical points , as obtained from the minimization , are exactly the same as those obtained from the bifurcation analysis .",
    "this in fact is the reason why we have chosen to use this model .",
    "once we calculate the phase diagram we can compare the results to those obtained using the bifurcation analysis . to implement the latter we need the following expressions : @xmath195 which allows , using the same procedure described above , to find the packing fraction at the bifurcation point , @xmath196 and the coefficient @xmath92 , @xmath197 where the constraint of all particle areas being equal to 1 was imposed and the same change of variables [ @xmath198 was used . finally , to find the demixing behavior of this model , we need to make the expression @xmath199 , \\label{zwanzig } \\\\",
    "s_k&=&\\sqrt{\\frac{\\langle \\cosh^{2k}\\theta\\rangle}{\\langle\\cosh^k \\theta\\rangle^2}-1 } , \\quad k=1,2\\\\ s_3&=&\\sqrt{\\frac{\\langle\\sinh^4\\theta\\rangle}{\\langle\\sinh^2\\theta\\rangle^2 } -1},\\quad a=\\frac{\\langle\\cosh^2\\theta\\rangle}{\\langle\\sinh^2\\theta\\rangle}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to vanish .",
    "the solutions of this equation for different values of @xmath129 are shown in fig .",
    "as can be seen the general topology is similar to that found for hdr . comparing both figures ( [ fig1 ] and [ fig4 ] ) we can draw as a conclusion that the discretization of orientations unfavors the i - n demixing .",
    "the phase diagram of a zwanzig binary mixture of species with aspect ratios @xmath200 equal to 9 ( @xmath201 ) and 2 ( @xmath202 ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] in the pressure - composition plane .",
    "the tricritical point ( where the i - n@xmath203 demixing transition changes from first to second order as the pressure is reduced ) at @xmath204 and @xmath205 coincides exactly with the point predicted from the bifurcation analysis ( see in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the upper intersection of the curve for @xmath137 with a vertical line located at @xmath206 ) .",
    "an important feature of this phase diagram is that the binodals of the i - n@xmath203 or n@xmath203-n@xmath207 transitions tend to the one - component asymptotes @xmath208 and @xmath209 as the pressure is increased .",
    "this trend , characteristic of demixing scenarios ( such as the usual i - i fluid demixing ) , should be compared with other possible topologies of phase diagrams ( for example , those of three - dimensional mixtures of particles of similar lengths ) , where the first - order i - n transition has two binodals that meet at the one - component limits of the phase diagram _ at finite pressure_. this criterion is the one we have used to consider the transitions found here as i - n demixing transitions instead of the standard i - n orientational transition .    as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , at higher pressure from the tricritical point there is a triple intersection between two first order transition lines ( the i binodal of the i - n@xmath203 transition and the n@xmath207 binodal of the n@xmath203-n@xmath207 transition ) and the second order i - n@xmath207 transition line .",
    "this point is called in the literature a _",
    "critical endpoint_. an important remark to make is that this critical endpoint located at @xmath210 and @xmath211 does not exactly coincide with the predicted result from the bifurcation analysis . if we look at the lower intersection between the curve corresponding to @xmath137 and the vertical line located at @xmath212 in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we find the value @xmath132 which corresponds to @xmath213 , which is lower than the above mentioned critical endpoint pressure .",
    "the reason for this disagreement can be elucidated if we plot the gibbs free energy per particle of the mixture as a function of @xmath108 for three different values of the pressure , @xmath213 , which is the pressure corresponding to the upper tricritical point as obtained from the bifurcation analysis [ the open circle in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig6](a ) corresponds to the bifurcation point ] ; @xmath214 , which corresponds to the triple intersection [ fig .",
    "[ fig6](b ) ] where the bifurcation and the coexistence points coalesce ; and @xmath215 , where the two coexistence points already lie on the nematic branch .",
    "the main conclusion we can draw from this is that the bifurcation analysis predicts exactly the tricritical point ( which corresponds to the lower pressure or higher @xmath132 in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) and gives an approximate value for the critical endpoint .    in the light of these results",
    "we can interpret fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) and try to predict , as an example , the demixing behavior of a mixture of freely rotating hr with @xmath124 and @xmath216 .",
    "if we increase the pressure @xmath217 following the i - n@xmath147 spinodal curve we find that at a composition defined as the intersection with the solid line ( the tricritical point ) the mixture begins to demix into i and n@xmath147 phases .",
    "the demixing gap becomes wider with pressure , and at high pressures the lower intersection with the dashed line defines the approximate location of a critical endpoint where the first order i - n@xmath147 and n@xmath147-n@xmath138 transitions coalesce with a second order i - n@xmath138 transition .",
    "increasing further the pressure we should have a n@xmath147-n@xmath138 coexistence and , ultimately , a coexistence between two uniaxial nematic phases .",
    "this latter coexistence could be predicted if we take into account the phase diagram for the one - component system , where the n@xmath138 phase is sandwiched between the i and n@xmath147 phases @xcite .",
    "in this section we want to explicity discuss the demixing scenarios that may occur in binary mixtures of hard particles .",
    "we will focus our attention on hdr mixtures . for this purpose",
    "we have parameterized the orientational distribution functions of each species as @xmath218 where @xmath219 is the zeroth - order modified bessel function .",
    "this parametrization fulfills the normalization constraint @xmath220 . the free energy per volume ( see sec .",
    "ii for its expression ) was minimized with respect to @xmath221 ( @xmath134 ) and the double - tangent construction on the thermodynamic potential @xmath222 ( the gibbs energy per particle in reduced units as a function of the composition of the mixture for a fixed pressure ) was used to calculate the coexistence values of the composition of the mixture and the packing fraction .",
    "the results for a mixture of hard disks ( @xmath124 ) and hdr with @xmath223 are shown in figs . [ fig7](a ) and [ fig7](b ) .",
    "for low pressures there is a continuous i - n transition at a pressure which agrees with that calculated from the spinodal packing fraction curve ( [ inserting ] ) . at some composition ( @xmath224 )",
    "we find a tricritical point from which the mixture begins to demix into the i phase ( rich in discs ) and the n phase ( rich in rods ) .",
    "the location of the tricritical point should be compared with that resulting from the bifurcation analysis ( @xmath225 ) which gives the exact result .",
    "the difference is due to the parametrization used . as we have already pointed out the value of @xmath132 depends on the coefficient @xmath92 which in turn depends on the @xmath70 ( @xmath226 ) .",
    "these are the expansion coefficients of the free - energy difference around the bifurcation point up to fourth order .",
    "although the used parametrization captures the right second order terms , further terms are only approximate due to the restriction on the minimization variables to be only one per species .    an interesting result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7](b ) , a zoom of fig .",
    "[ fig7](a ) around the tricritical point . as we can see",
    "this part of the phase diagram exhibits a n@xmath203-n@xmath207 coexistence which ends in a critical point , along with the presence of a i - n@xmath203-n@xmath207 triple point .",
    "as these features are similar to those observed in the zwanzig mixture ( not shown here ) , where no parametrization was used , we are confident that this scenario is qualitatively correct .    two other phase diagrams are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig8 ] and [ fig9 ] for different mixtures .",
    "the topology of the first one is similar to that found in the zwanzig mixture , where the i - n@xmath203 demixing is followed by n@xmath203-n@xmath207 coexistence and the phase diagram includes one tricritical and one critical endpoint .",
    "the third phase diagram ( see fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ) includes an i - n transition which is always of second order and , at high pressures , a n@xmath203-n@xmath207 demixing ending in a critical point .",
    "this kind of phase diagram is typical of mixtures of particles with similar aspect ratios . since the pressures at which the demixing transition occurs are rather high",
    ", we expect this transition to be metastable with respect to phases with partial or full spatial order .",
    "comparing the phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] with the exact bifurcation analysis results ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) , we can conclude that , even though i - n demixing is already allowed from @xmath227 , the parametrization used changes the demixing behavior of the mixture .",
    "an exact free - energy minimization for the same value of @xmath129 and for @xmath228 should qualitatively give a phase diagram similar to that shown in fig .",
    "while i - i demixing is forbidden in two - dimensional hard - body additive mixtures of anisotropic particles according to spt @xcite , we have shown in the present work that the inclusion of ordered phases with orientational symmetry breaking changes completely the demixing scenario .",
    "the phase diagrams characteristic of these mixtures can exhibit i - n and n - n demixing .",
    "we have used a bifurcation analysis to demonstrate rigorously that i - n demixing occurs . on the other hand ,",
    "explicit calculations of the phase diagrams of hdr , using an accurate parametrization , have been performed in order to show the occurrence of n - n demixing .",
    "the simple structure of spt allowed us to obtain analytically the stability criterion for the mixture as a function of packing fraction , composition and shape of the constituent particles .",
    "thus , using this procedure , we can predict the i - n demixing scenarios for mixtures of hdr and hr .    to show the relative stability of these demixed phases with respect to nonuniform phases ( e.g. , solid phases )",
    ", we would need to carry out a full minimization , with respect to the density profile @xmath229 ( which also depends on spatial variables ) , of a density functional constructed in such a way that it recovers the spt in the uniform limit .",
    "this work is a task in progress .",
    "finally , we expect that all the demixing scenarios predicted here be confirmed by computer simulations of hard - body mixtures in two dimensions .",
    "these simulations are still lacking .",
