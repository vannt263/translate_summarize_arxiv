    "as discussed in this pep - n meeting , the facilities that copiously produce the lower - lying mesons such as @xmath2 and @xmath3 can provide a lot of rich physics as exciting as the new and upgraded @xmath4-meson factories promise . to fulfill such excitement ,",
    "however , intensive theoretical studies should be accompanied in the analyses of exclusive meson decays and form factors .",
    "thus , more and more scrutinized model analyses are called for .",
    "perhaps , one of the most popular formulations for the analysis of exclusive processes may be provided in the framework of light - front ( lf ) quantization  @xcite . in particular , the drell - yan - west ( @xmath5 ) frame has been extensively used in the calculation of various electroweak form factors and decay processes  @xcite . as an example , only the parton - number - conserving ( valence ) fock state contribution is needed in @xmath6 frame when the  good \" component of the current , @xmath7 or @xmath8 , is used for the spacelike electromagnetic form factor calculation of pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "the lf approach may also provide a bridge between the two fundamentally different pictures of hadronic matter , i.e. the constituent quark model ( cqm ) ( or the quark parton model ) closely related to the experimental observations and the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) based on a covariant non - abelian quantum field theory .",
    "the crux of possible connection between the two pictures is the rational energy - momentum dispersion relation that leads to a relatively simple vacuum structure .",
    "there is no spontaneous creation of massive fermions in the lf quantized vacuum .",
    "thus , one can immediately obtain a constituent - type picture , in which all partons in a hadronic state are connected directly to the hadron instead of being simply disconnected excitations ( or vacuum fluctuations ) in a complicated medium .",
    "a possible realization of chiral symmetry breaking in the lf vacuum has also been discussed in the literature  @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", the analysis of timelike exclusive processes ( or timelike @xmath9 region of bound - state form factors ) remained as a rather significant challenge in the lf approach . in principle , the @xmath10 frame can be used to compute the timelike processes but then it is inevitable to encounter the particle - number - nonconserving fock state ( or nonvalence ) contribution .",
    "the main source of difficulty in cqm phenomenology is the lack of information on the non - wave - function vertex(black blob in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) ) in the nonvalence diagram arising from the quark - antiquark pair creation / annihilation .",
    "the non - wave - function vertex(black blob ) was recently also called the embedded state  @xcite .",
    "this should contrast with the white blob representing the usual lf valence wave function .    in principle",
    ", there is a systematic program laid out by brodsky and hwang  @xcite to include the particle - number - nonconserving amplitude to take into account the nonvalence contributions .",
    "however , such program requires to find all the higher fock - state wave functions while there has been relatively little progress in computing the basic wave functions of hadrons from first principles .",
    "recently , a method of analytic continuation from the spacelike region has also been suggested to generate necessary informations in the timelike region without encountering a direct calculation of the nonvalence contribution  @xcite .",
    "even though some explicit example has been presented for manifestly covariant theoretical models , this method has not yet been implemented to more realistic phenomenological models .    in this talk , we thus present an alternative way of handling the nonvalence contribution .",
    "our aim of new treatment  @xcite is to make the program more suitable for the cqm phenomenology specific to the low momentum transfer processes .",
    "incidentally , the light - to - light ( @xmath0 ) and heavy - to - light ( @xmath11 ) decays involving rather low momentum transfers bear a substantial contribution from the nonvalence part and their experimental data are better known than other semileptonic processes with large momentum transfers . including the nonvalence contribution , our results on @xmath0 and @xmath11 not only show a definite improvement in comparison with experimental data but",
    "also exhibit a covariance ( i.e frame - independence ) of our approach .",
    "this talk is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we present the non - wave - function vertex in the nonvalence diagram in terms of light - front vertex functions , utilizing the covariant bethe - salpeter(bs ) model of ( 3@xmath121)-dimensional fermion field theory .",
    "the nonvalence part of the weak form factors for @xmath13 semileptonic decays is expressed in terms of light - front vertex functions of a hadron and a gauge boson .",
    "the link operator connecting @xmath14-body to @xmath15-body in a fock state representation is obtained by an analytic continuation of the usual bs amplitude .",
    "we also show that the complicated @xmath16-body energy denominators are exactly cancelled in summing the light - front time - ordered diagrams . in section 3",
    ", we show our numerical results for @xmath0 and @xmath11 decays .",
    "conclusions follow in section 4 .",
    "the semileptonic decay of @xmath18 bound state with four - momentum @xmath19 and mass @xmath20 into another @xmath21 bound state with @xmath22 and @xmath23 is governed by the weak current , viz .",
    ", j^(0)&=&p_2||q_2^q_1|p_1 + & = & f_+(q^2)(p_1+p_2)^ + f_-(q^2)q^ , where @xmath24 is the four - momentum transfer to the lepton pair ( @xmath25 ) and @xmath26 . the covariant three - point bethe - salpeter ( bs ) amplitude of the total current @xmath27 in eq .",

    "the quark momentum variables are given by @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 .",
    "as shown in the literature  @xcite , the lf energy integration reveals an explicit correspondence between the sum of lf time - ordered amplitudes and the original covariant amplitude .",
    "for instance , performing the @xmath34 pole integration , we obtain the lf currents , @xmath35 and @xmath36 corresponding to the usual lf valence diagram and the nonvalence diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , respectively .",
    "since @xmath37 satisfies the bs equation , we iterate @xmath37 once and perform its lf energy integration to find the corresponding lf time - ordered diagrams figs .  [ fig1](b ) and  [ fig1](c ) after the iteration .",
    "the similar idea of iteration in a schwinger - dyson ( sd ) type of approach was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite to pin down the lf bound - state equation starting from the covariant bs equation .    comparing the lf time - ordered expansions before and after the iteration",
    ", we realize that the following link between the non - wave - function vertex ( black blob ) and the ordinary lf wave function ( white blob ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] naturally arises , i.e. , [ eq : sd ] & & ( m^2-m^2_0)(x_i,*k*_i ) + & & = ( x_i,*k*_i;y_j,*l*_j ) ( y_j,*l*_j ) , where @xmath38 is the mass of outgoing meson and @xmath39 with @xmath40 due to the kinematics of the non - wave - function vertex .",
    "we note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : sd ] ) essentially takes the same form as the lf bound - state equation ( similar to the lf projection of bs equation ) except the difference in kinematics(e.g .",
    "@xmath41 for the non - wave - function vertex ) .",
    "incidentally , einhorn  @xcite also discussed the extension of the lf bs amplitude in 1 + 1 qcd to a non - wave - function vertex similar to what we obtained in this work .    in the above procedure",
    ", we also find that the four - body energy denominator @xmath42 is exactly cancelled in the sum of lf time - ordered amplitudes as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig1](b ) and  [ fig1](c ) , i.e. , @xmath43 .",
    "we thus obtain the amplitude identical to the nonvalence contribution in terms of ordinary lf wave functions of gauge boson(@xmath44 ) and hadron ( white blob ) as drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig1](d ) .",
    "this method , however , requires to have some relevant operator depicted as the black square(@xmath45 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig2](see also fig .",
    "[ fig1](d ) ) , that is in general dependent on the involved momenta connecting one - body to three - body sector .",
    "we now present some details of kinematics in the semileptonic decay processes to discuss a reasoning of how we handle the nonvalence contribution involving the momentum - dependent @xmath45 for relatively small momentum transfer processes such as @xmath46 , @xmath0 and @xmath47 .",
    "our calculation is performed in purely longitudinal momentum frame  @xcite where @xmath48 and @xmath49 so that the momentum transfer square @xmath50 is time - like .",

    "now , the range of the momentum fraction @xmath90 depends on the external momenta for the embedded states . as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : jnv ] ) , the lower bound of @xmath90 for the kernel in the nonvalence contribution is given by @xmath54 which has the value @xmath92 at the maximum @xmath51 .",
    "as the mass difference between the primary and secondary mesons gets smaller , not only the range of @xmath51 is reduced but also @xmath54 gets closer to 1 .",
    "perhaps , the best experimental process for such limit may be the pion beta decay @xmath93 , where our numerical prediction @xmath94 following the treatment presented in this work is in an excellent agreement with @xmath95 obtained by the method proposed by jaus  @xcite including the zero - modes  @xcite . in ademollo - gatto s su(3 )",
    "limit  @xcite , the @xmath51 range of the nonvalence contribution shrinks to zero and @xmath54 becomes precisely 1 .",
    "however , even if @xmath54 is not so close to 1 , the initial wavefunction @xmath96 plays the role of a weighting factor in the nonvalence contribution and enfeeble the contribution from the region of @xmath90 near 1 .",
    "thus , for the processes that we discuss in this talk , the effective @xmath90 region for the nonvalence contribution is quite narrow .",
    "similarly , the region of the transverse momentum @xmath91 is also limited only up to the scale of hadron size due to the same weighting factor @xmath96 . here , we thus approximate @xmath97 as a constant and examine the validity of this approximation by checking the frame independence of our numerical results .",
    "for the check of frame - independence , we also compute the ",
    "@xmath12 \" component of the current @xmath98 in the drell - yan - west ( @xmath6 ) frame where only valence contribution exists .",
    "since the form factor @xmath99 obtained from @xmath100 in @xmath6 frame is immune to the zero - mode contribution  @xcite , the comparison of @xmath99 in the two completely different frames ( i.e. @xmath6 and @xmath10 ) would reveal the validity of existing model with respect to a covariance .",
    "the comparison of @xmath101 , however , can not give a meaningful test of covariance because of the zero - mode complication as noted in ref .",
    "indeed , the difference between the two ( @xmath6 and @xmath10 ) results of @xmath101 amounts to the zero - mode contribution .",

    "[ kl3 ] , we show the weak form factors @xmath99 and @xmath65 for @xmath103 decays .",
    "the thick solid lines are our analytic solutions obtained from the @xmath6 frame ; note here again that the lower thick solid line ( @xmath104 ) in fig .",
    "[ kl3 ] is only the partial result without including the zero - mode contribution while the upper thick solid line ( @xmath105 immune to the zero - mode ) is the full result .",
    "the thin solid lines are the full results of our effective calculations with a constant ( @xmath106=3.95 ) fixed by the normalization of @xmath105 at @xmath107 limit . for comparison , we also show only the valence contributions(dotted lines ) in @xmath10 frame .",
    "as expected , a clearly distinguishable nonvalence contribution is found . following the popular linear parametrization  @xcite , we plot the results of our effective solutions(thin solid lines ) using @xmath108 . in comparison with the data , the same normalization as the data @xmath109  @xcite was used in fig .",
    "our effective solution(upper thin solid line ) is not only in a good agreement with the data  @xcite but also almost identical to that in @xmath6 frame(upper thick solid line ) indicating the frame - independence of our model .",
    "note also that the difference in @xmath65 between @xmath10(lower thin solid line ) and @xmath6(lower thick solid line ) frames amounts to the zero - mode contribution .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in comparison with experimental data , we summarized our results of several experimental observables in table  1 ; i.e. the actual value of @xmath110 , the slopes @xmath111 [ @xmath112 of @xmath99 [ @xmath65 ] at @xmath107 , @xmath114=@xmath115 , and the decay rates @xmath116 and @xmath117 . in the second column of table  1 ,",
    "our full results including nonvalence contributions are presented along with the valence contributions in the square brackets . in the third column of table  1 ,",
    "the results in @xmath6 frame are presented with[without ] the instantaneous part .",
    "as one can see in table 1 , adding the nonvalence contributions clearly improves the results of @xmath118 , i.e. our full result of @xmath118= 0.025 is in an excellent agreement with the data , @xmath119= 0.025@xmath1200.006 .",
    "since the lepton mass is small except in the case of the @xmath121 lepton , one may safely neglect the lepton mass in the decay rate calculation of the heavy - to - heavy and heavy - to - light transitions .",
    "however , as one can see from the improved result for @xmath122 decay rate , the reliable calculation of @xmath65 is required especially for @xmath123 since the muon(@xmath124 ) mass is not negligible , even though the contribution of @xmath65 is negligible for @xmath125 case .    in figs .",

    "all the line assignments are same as in fig .  3 . in fig .",
