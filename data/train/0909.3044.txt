    "in the standard model ( e.g. urry & padovani 1995 ) , active galactic nuclei ( agn ) consist of an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) surrounded by a torus of dust and gas . the accretion disk is a source of ultraviolet and optical continuum emission , while x - rays are believed to originate through inverse compton scattering of soft seed photons from the disk by hot electrons in a surrounding corona .",
    "dust in the torus absorbs the emission from the accretion disk and re - emits it in the mid - infrared .",
    "type 1 ( unobscured ) and type 2 ( obscured ) agn are intrinsically the same , but they display different characteristics because of their orientation . in type 2 agn the torus is viewed nearer edge - on , obscuring the central source , whereas in type 1 agn , the torus is viewed nearer face - on , providing an unobscured view of the central source @xcite .",
    "obscured agn have long been identified by their narrow high - ionization emission lines in the optical band , produced by photoionized gas far above and below the plane of the torus .",
    "obscured agn can also be recognized by the mid - infrared emission from the torus .",
    "optical and infrared surveys show that obscured agn constitute the majority of the population ( e.g. risaliti et al .",
    "1999 ; hao et al . 2005 ) .",
    "hard x - rays ( e @xmath5 2 kev ) also offer a potentially powerful way to find obscured agn .",
    "so long as the obscuring column density ( n@xmath6 ) is @xmath7 @xmath1 ( the compton - thin regime ) , hard x - rays will suffer little absorption .",
    "however , observations of a local ( @xmath80.035 ) sample of 49 type 2 agn show that in fact many of these are very weak in the 2 - 10 kev x - ray band ( guainazzi et al .",
    "2005 ) . in the chandra deep field south ,",
    "only 82 out of over 300 agn with optical spectroscopy were `` x - ray bright '' ( @xmath580 counts in the 2 - 10 kev band ) .",
    "though this sample includes agn up to much higher redshifts ( up to @xmath9 ) , the subsamples of x - ray bright and x - ray faint targets have similar redshift distributions , indicating that the x - ray faint nature of the sample is not due to selection effects but rather that the majority of targets are weak x - ray emitters ( tozzi et al .",
    "the cases where the x - ray emission is severely attenuated are interpreted as cases in which the torus is compton - thick ( n@xmath10 10@xmath11 @xmath1 ) .",
    "more recent surveys with _ integral _ and _ swift _ suggest that a at least some low redshift ( @xmath12 0.05 ) type 2 agn remain weak emitters even at substantially higher photon energies ( @xmath5 10 kev , e.g. treister et al .",
    "2009 for @xmath12 0.05 , but see melndez et al .",
    "this would require even higher obscuring column densities ( @xmath13 @xmath14 ) .",
    "how do we know that the weakness of the hard x - ray emission in these type 2 agn is due to obscuration rather than an intrinsic property ( e.g. brightman & nandra 2008 ) ?",
    "fortunately , there are signatures of obscuration in the x - ray spectra themselves .",
    "the weak x - ray emission that is seen in such cases often has a relatively flat x - ray spectrum and a strong fe k@xmath4 emission - line .",
    "these features are indicative of heavily reprocessed emission such as from reflection of hard x - rays off of the torus wall .",
    "this is as expected for a highly obscured x - ray source .",
    "the weakness of the hard x - ray emission in many type 2 agn ( regardless of its origin ) implies that hard x - ray surveys do not fully probe the agn population .",
    "this is important from several perspectives .",
    "first , phenomenological models often invoke a significant population of obscured agn in order to successfully match the spectral energy distribution of the cosmic x - ray background at energies above 10 kev @xcite .",
    "are such models consistent with the observed properties of obscured agn ?",
    "second , deep x - ray surveys can detect agn out to high redshift .",
    "they then allow us to probe the cosmic evolution of the agn population down to luminosities and smbh masses well below the levels reached in optical surveys of quasars .",
    "are the implications drawn from such surveys affected by a bias against compton - thick agn ?    to address these issues , it is important to study a complete sample of agn selected without regard to their hard x - ray properties .",
    "optical spectroscopic surveys can in principle provide such a sample .",
    "type 2 agn in these surveys are identified by the high - excitation narrow emission from photoionized gas in the narrow line region ( nlr ) , material located hundreds of parsecs out along the polar axis of the torus .",
    "this emission is therefore unaffected by the obscuration of the torus itself and to first - order is radiated isotropically .",
    "comparison of the luminosity of the gas in the nlr to that in hard x - rays can then be used to estimate the amount of x - ray obscuration .",
    "the most commonly used optical emission - line is [ oiii]@xmath25007 ( e.g. bassani et al .",
    "1999 ; heckman et al .",
    "several indicators of the intrinsic agn luminosity also exist in the mid - infrared band where the effects of obscuration will be minimal . a close analog to the [ oiii]@xmath25007 line is the luminosity of the [ oiv ] 25.89@xmath3 m line from the nlr ( e.g. melndez et al .",
    "2008 , diamond - stanic et al .",
    "2009 , rigby et al .",
    "the luminosity of the mid - infrared continuum from the torus is also a useful indicator , although the torus is not believed to emit in a fully isotropic fashion ( e.g. pier & krolik 1993 ; nenkova et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "in this paper we present x - ray analysis of a nearly complete sample of 17 type 2 seyfert galaxies ( sy2 ) selected from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) based on their high [ oiii]@xmath25007 flux .",
    "using pointed _ xmm - newton _ observations of these sources , we derive their x - ray spectral characteristics and calculate their hard x - ray luminosities .",
    "we then use the sdss data to measure the luminosities of [ oiii]@xmath25007 lines and spitzer space telescope infrared spectrograph ( irs ) data to measure the luminosities of the mid - infrared continuum and of the [ oiv ] 25.89@xmath3 line .",
    "we use these data to assess the amount of x - ray obscuration .",
    "we also use measurements of the fe k@xmath4 line as an additional tool for probing highly obscured x - ray emission .",
    "finally , we use the sdss and spitzer data to derive the basic intrinsic properties of the agns and their host galaxies .",
    "this allows us to determine whether the compton - thick and compton - thin populations differ in any systematic way .",
    "our type 2 agn are drawn from a parent sample of the spectra of roughly 480,000 galaxies in the sdss data release 4 @xmath15 dr4 @xcite .",
    "this parent sample of `` sdss main galaxies '' @xcite is complete over the sdss dr4 footprint and is selected solely on the basis of the galaxy r - band apparent magnitude ( 14.5 @xmath16 17.77 ) .",

    "( 2006 ) was used to identify type 2 agn based on the sdss spectra .",
    "our sample was then defined as the 20 such objects having an observed [ oiii]@xmath25007 flux above 4@xmath18 erg @xmath1 s@xmath19 , corresponding to a luminosity of @xmath2010@xmath21 erg / s at the median distance for our sample ( @xmath20150 mpc ) .",
    "xmm - newton data exist for 17 of the 20 objects in our sample , so the present sample is nearly complete .",
    "we note that our sample is highly complementary to the sample of `` type ii quasars '' investigated by zakamska et al .",
    "( 2003 ; 2008 ) and ptak et al .",
    "these objects were selected on the basis of a high [ oiii]@xmath25007 luminosity ( rather than on the basis of a flux limit as we have done ) .",
    "the type ii quasars were drawn from the full set of sdss spectra , rather than from the homogeneous sdss main galaxy sample .",
    "these objects define the extreme high luminosity end of the type 2 agn population , while our sample deals with typical type 2 agn .",
    "we were awarded _",
    "xmm - newton _ time to observe 15 members of the 20 from this sample for a nominal 23 ks per target before filtering .",
    "two additional targets from this sample were previously observed with _",
    "xmm - newton _ and were added : 0325 - 0608 ( mrk 609 , pi : aschenbach ) and 1218 + 4706 ( pi : page ) , bringing the sample total to 17 .",
    "table [ sample ] lists the targets along with their obsid number .",
    "the luminosity distances listed in table [ sample ] are based on the optical spectroscopic redshift , adopting a cosmology of h@xmath22 = 71 km s@xmath19 mpc@xmath19 , @xmath23 = 0.27 and @xmath24 = 0.73 .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ data were reduced using xassist @xcite , which runs the science analysis system ( sas ) tasks to filter the raw data , generate light curves , clean the data for flaring , and extract spectra and associated response files ( _ rmfs _ and _ arfs _ ) for user - defined sources .",

    "the net x - ray counts , soft counts ( 0.5 - 2 kev ) and hard counts ( 2 - 10 kev ) are listed in table  [ counts ] .    for most of the sources",
    ", there were sufficient counts to group the pn , mos1 , and mos2 data by @xmath55 counts / bin ( and in a majority of these cases , @xmath510 counts / bin ) and we used the @xmath25 statistic for the spectral analysis .",
    "the following targets were grouped by 2 - 3 counts / bin and were therefore analyzed using the c - statistic ( xspec handles spectral fitting via c - stat better when the data are slightly binned rather than unbinned , e.g. teng et al 2005 ) : 0053 - 0846 , 1123 + 4703 , and 1346 + 6423 .",
    "one target , 1218 + 4706 , fell on the chip gap in the pn detector , so we analyzed only the mos1 and mos2 data for this source .",
    "the pn , mos1 and mos2 data were fit simultaneously for each source in xspec , with all parameters tied together except for a constant multiplicative factor , which was frozen at 1 for the pn spectra and allowed to vary between 0.8 to 1.2 for mos1 and mos2 , as the responses among detectors should generally not vary by greater than @xmath2020@xmath26 ( http://xmm.vilspa.esa.es/docs/documents/cal-tn-0052.ps.gz ) ; though in some cases , these limits were extended slightly to better fit the data when necessary ( i.e. when the error on the statistical count rate is @xmath520% ) .",
    "we first fit all targets with a simple absorbed power law .",
    "the parameters derived from these fits are given in table  [ pow ] .",
    "in many cases , a second power law component at higher energies was needed to accommodate the data , evident by both the shape of the spectrum and the inability of a single absorbed powerlaw to accurately model the data as reflected by the high @xmath25 value for a single power law fit .",
    "the targets best fit by a single absorbed power law are 0325 - 0608 , 0959 + 1259 , 1018 + 3722 , 1123 + 4703 , 1346 + 6423 and 1437 + 3634 .",
    "the remaining 11 targets were fit by a double absorbed power law , where the photon indices for the 2 powerlaw components were tied together . in some cases ( 0325 - 0608 ,",
    "0800 + 2636 , 0824 + 2959 , 1111 + 0228 , 1123 + 4703 and 1218 + 4706 ) , the best - fit absorption was the same as the galactic absorption , so we froze this parameter to the galactic value for these spectral fits ; for 1346 + 6423 , the spectral fit was best constrained by freezing absorption to the galactic value and the photon index to 1.8 .",
    "the best - fit parameters from these fits are listed in table [ pow ] , along with their corresponding @xmath27 values . as shown in table [ ftest ] , the double power law fit passes the f - test at almost or better than the 3@xmath28 confidence level for all 11 targets to which it was applied , indicating that this model more accurately represents the data .",
    "though applying the f - test to certain astrophysical tests is inappropriate ( e.g. protassov et al . 2002 ) , the high probabilities derived indicate that the more complex models are likely statistically robust .",
    "this second power law component indicates that we are observing scattered and/or reflected agn emission from these sources .",
    "we note that several targets have photon indices quite a bit steeper than commonly observed in seyfert galaxies , with a typical range being e.g. 0.5 @xmath29 2.3 ( cappi et al .",
    "2006 ) : 0804 + 2345 , 1018 + 3722 , 1136 + 5657 , 1147 + 5226 , and 1157 + 5249 on these sources is greater than 2.5 ] .",
    "better modeling of the soft emission , as discussed below , can result in a less steep photon index for the nuclear component .",
    "levenson et al . ( 2004 ; 2005 ) and guainazzi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) showed that soft thermal emission from hot gas associated with a starburst is commonly found in seyfert galaxies .",
    "we will discuss the evidence for starbursts in our sample based on the sdss and spitzer irs spectra in a future paper .",
    "here we simply accommodate the possible presence of a starburst by fitting each of the targets with a thermal component ( apec in xspec ) added to the aforementioned absorbed single or double powerlaw model .",
    "the metal abundances were initially fixed to solar , allowing only the plasma temperature and normalization to be fit .",
    "we were able to fit the metal abundances for 2 of the sources : 0053 - 0846 and 1123 - 4703 .",
    "the fit parameters from the powerlaw plus thermal model are listed in table [ apec ] . for 4 of the targets ( 0325 - 0608 , 1018 + 3722",
    ", 1123 + 4703 , and 1147 + 5226 ) , addition of the thermal component significantly improved the results at greater than the @xmath30 level according to the f - test ( see table [ ftest_apec ] ) .",
    "we note that inclusion of this model component causes the power law index to decrease and to fall within the more commonly observed range for 1147 + 5226 and 1157 + 5249 ; though @xmath31 increases for 1018 + 3722 , the lower end of the 90% confidence level for this parameter now falls within the typical range observed in seyferts .",
    "however , the power law indices remained too steep for 0804 + 2345 and 1136 + 5667 ( 4.94@xmath32 and 3.11@xmath33 , respectively ) and allowing the two photon indices to be fit independently caused more unphysical results : a negative @xmath34 for 0804 + 2345 and a much steeper @xmath34 for 1136 + 5667 .",
    "hence we froze @xmath34 at 1.8 for these sources .    using the apec model , we calculated the thermal x - ray luminosity ( l@xmath35 ) for all sources .",
    "we also fit these sources with the abundance of the thermal component frozen to 0.3 since though solar abundances would be expected in spiral galaxies , lower abundances are observed in practice when x - ray binaries are not resolved out , `` diluting '' the observed abundances ( e.g. ptak et al .",
    "we find the fit parameters to be consistent with those where the abundance is frozen to solar and find the thermal luminosity to be consistent between both cases , with at most a factor of two difference . in a future paper",
    ", we will examine the relationship between thermal x - ray emission and star formation rate ( sfr ) .",

    "these simulated spectra were then fit with a power law and gaussian component to assess the probability that the fe k@xmath4 feature is detected due to random noise ( we performed rigorous error analysis on a sub - set of these simulated spectra and found no statistical significant change in the fe k@xmath4 detection when new global minimizations were found ) .",
    "the simulation results indicate that the chance of detecting the fe k@xmath4 line at or above the observed value due to random variations is less than 1% for 0800 + 2636 , 0824 + 2959 , 0959 + 1259 , 1147 + 5226 , 1157 + 5249 , 1238 + 0927 and 1323 + 4318 ; less than 6% for 0325 - 0608 , and less than 14% for 1218 + 4706 .",

    "the inclination angle was constrained for 3 targets ( 0800 + 2636 , 0824 + 2959 , and 1238 + 0927 ) , indicating that these lines are likely doppler broadened .",

    "the first is the luminosity of the [ oiv ] 25.89@xmath3 m emission - line .",

    "this is produced by the warm dust in the obscuring torus . as described in heckman et al .",
    "( 2009 ) we have defined two windows in the mid - infrared spectrum that are devoid of significant emission or absorption features : one is centered at 13.5@xmath3 m and the other at 30@xmath3 m .",
    "the mid - infrared continuum luminosity we use in this paper is the sum of the monochromatic luminosities ( @xmath49 ) at the midpoints of these two bands . in principle ,",
    "dust emission associated with a starburst can also contribute to the mid - ir continuum . to assess this ,",

    "we then found the @xmath76 that corresponds to the observed count rate by computing the model predicted count rate ( i.e. the ratio of the observed count rate to the predicted unabsorbed count rate multiplied by the count rate for the @xmath76=0 case ) and interpolating the effective @xmath76 that would produce this model count rate .",
    "the results are summarized in table [ gamma ] , for simulations where @xmath31 was held at 1.8 and the covering fraction was varied , and table [ cf ] , for simulations where the covering fraction is held at 0.99 and @xmath31 was varied .",
    "this range of covering fraction and @xmath31 was chosen to assess how the implied absorption varies with the covering fraction and power law index ( i.e. the is range is consistent with many seyfert 2 galaxies but does not span the full parameter for absorbed agn ) .",
    "also , though a partial covering model may fit the data well , such a model may be too simplistic as higher signal - to - noise spectra would require more components ; we use partial covering as a simple proxy for the complex absorption likely occuring and use this to analyze trends that result from modeling spectra more complicated than a single absorbed power - law .",
    "as table [ cf ] shows , varying @xmath31 does not significantly alter the results .",

    "( 2005 ) : the distribution is relatively narrow and there is no significant difference between the type 1 and type 2 agn .",
    "this is because such samples exclude the compton - thick type 2 agn .",
    "next , we use the [ oiv ] 25.89@xmath3 m line luminosity as a tracer of the agn luminosity . in the right panel of figure [ other_samp ]",
    "we compare the distribution of log ( l@xmath96l@xmath51}$ ] as function of log ( l@xmath51}$ ] ) for our optically - selected sample to that of the bat - selected sample of radio - quiet type 2 agn in melndez et al .",
    "the distributions are similar , with 8/15 of the bat - selected objects and 10/17 of our optically - selected objects having ratios of l@xmath96l@xmath51}$ ] more than an order - of - magnitude lower than the mean value for radio - quiet type 1 agn in melndez et al ( log ( l@xmath96l@xmath51}$ ] ) @xmath20 2.1 @xmath45 0.3 dex ) .    taken together , the results in figure [ other_samp ] imply that selection in the 14 - 195 kev band is recovering a significant fraction of the sources that are heavily obscured in the 2 - 10 kev band .",
    "this agrees at least qualitatively with the conclusions of winter et al .",
    "( 2009 ) : of 22 agn in the sample detected in the 14 - 195 kev band , 5 are compton - thick candidates and an additional 4 were hidden / buried , or very compton - thick , agn that would be missed in sample selection at lower energies . however , this contrasts with the results of treister et al .",
    "( 2009 ) who found a low number of compton - thick agn using high energy ( e @xmath5 10 kev ) surveys : 5 of the 130 agn detected with integral and 8 of the 130 agn detected with swift were compton - thick .",
    "in this paper we have undertaken a study of the hard x - ray properties ( 2 - 10 kev ) of a nearly complete sample of the 17 brightest type 2 ( obscured ) agn selected from a sample of 480,000 galaxies in the fourth data release of the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "these are representative of optically - bright type 2 agn in the low - redshift universe ( @xmath12 0.l ) .",
    "we have used the value of the luminosity of the [ oiii]@xmath25007 emission - line for the agn s narrow line region ( nlr ) -corrected for dust extinction using the observed h@xmath4/h@xmath17 - as a proxy for the intrinsic luminosity of the agn ( e.g. bassani et al .",
    "1999 ; kauffmann & heckman 2009 ) .",
    "we have also used the _ spitzer space telescope _ to measure the luminosity of the mid - infrared [ oiv ] 25.89@xmath3 m line from the nlr ( e.g. melndez et al . 2008 ) and the luminosity of the mid - infrared continuum from the obscuring torus ( e.g. nenkova et al . 2008 ) as additional indicators of the agn intrinsic luminosity .",
    "the [ oiii ] and [ oiv ] lines are useful because they originate well outside the torus and should therefore be unaffected by its obscuration .",
    "in contrast , the hard x - rays originate inside the torus and can be strongly attenuated in type 2 agn for a compton - thick torus with n@xmath97 @xmath1 .",
    "we have therefore used the ratio of the observed hard x - ray luminosity to the luminosities of the [ oiii ] and [ oiv ] emission - lines and to the mid - infrared continuum luminosity as an indicator of the amount of obscuration of the hard x - ray source .",
    "we have also used the equivalent width of the fe k@xmath4 emission line at 6.4 kev as an additional diagnostic of a heavily obscured hard x - ray source .",
    "we found that the ratio of the hard x - ray luminosity to that of the [ oiii ] and [ oiv ] lines and of the mid - infrared continuum in our sample spans an enormous range ( nearly four orders - of - magnitude ) . in a majority ( 11/17 ) of the cases ,",
    "the luminosity ratios are more than an order - of - magnitude lower than the mean value for type 1 ( unobscured ) agn , and these objects are likely to be compton - thick . while similar results have been reported before ( e.g. bassani et al . 1999 ; heckman et al .",
    "2005 ) , our results are the first that have been determined for a complete sample of type 2 agn selected in homogeneous way on the basis of their optical emission - line flux .    in principle",
    ", the relative weakness of the hard x - ray emission could be an intrinsic property of the agn , rather than a consequence of obscuration ( e.g. brightman & nandra 2008 ) .",
    "we have used the properties of the fe k@xmath4 line at 6.4 kev to distinguish between these possibilities .",
    "we found that there is a good inverse correlation in our sample between the equivalent width of the k@xmath4 line and relative luminosity of the 2 - 10 kev continuum .",
    "we have argued that this is consistent with an obscured x - ray source in which the emergent spectrum has been significantly reprocessed .",
    "in such a case the k@xmath4 photons traverse significantly lower column densities of absorbing gas than do the underlying ( @xmath20 6 to 7 kev ) continuum photons , and large k@xmath4 equivalent widths result ( e.g. krolik & kallman 1987 ; levenson et al .",
    "our results are consistent with those reported by bassani et al .",
    "( 1999 ) which were based on a heterogeneous sample of type 2 agn .",
    "we have shown that in some cases the high amount of inferred obscuration is inconsistent with the estimate of the column of absorbing gas derived from fits of simple spectral models to the data ( e.g. single or double power - law spectra transmitted through a homogeneous foreground screen ) .",
    "we have constructed more physically realistic models with partial covering of the x - ray source plus compton scattering .",
    "we run simulations of these models constrained by the ratio of the 2 - 10 kev and [ oiii]@xmath25007 fluxes and found that in some cases significantly higher absorbing column densities were implied than those derived from the simple spectral fits .",
    "we have concluded that the latter columns are not reliable for heavily obscured ( compton - thick ) agn .",
    "similar results have been obtained by melndez et al .",
    "( 2008 ) .",
    "we found that the populations of compton - thick and compton - thin type 2 agn in our sample do not differ systematically in terms of the luminosity of the agn , the mass of the black hole , or the luminosity with respect to the eddington limit .",
    "likewise , we found no differences in the star formation rate or the star formation rate per unit stellar mass ( measured in the central few - kpc - scale region covered by the sdss spectra ) .",
    "we have also compared our results for an optically - selected sample of type 2 agn to those for samples selected in the _ swift _ bat 14 - 195 kev energy band ( landi et al . 2007 ; winter et al . 2008 ; melndez et al .",
    "2008 ) . using the relative strength of the 2 - 10 kev and the [ oiii]@xmath25007 and [ oiv ] 25.89 @xmath3 m luminosities",
    ", we find that the bat - selected agn have an implied distribution of attenuation in the 2 - 10 kev band that is similar to that seen in our optically - selected sample .",
    "this suggests that samples selected in the _ swift _ bat band do recover a significant fraction of the local population of compton - thick agn .",
    "we conclude that , despite the penetrating power of hard x - rays , the majority of low - redshift type 2 agn still suffer significant obscuration in the 2 - 10 kev band .",
    "thus , existing x - ray surveys in this band will have missed a significant fraction of the population of obscured agn .",
    "fortunately , it appears that the missing population of x - ray - selected agn do not differ systematically in terms of the basic properties of the agn and of the stellar populations in their host galaxy .",
    "that is - at least in the local universe - the compton - thick and compton - thin type 2 agn do not seem to trace distinct populations .                                                                                                                                          0053 - 0846 & 81.4 & ngc 0291 & 0504100301 & 2007 - 06 - 24 & 6.4/6.2/2.2 + 0325 - 0608 & 147.4 & mrk 609 & 0103861001 & 2002 - 08 - 13 & 9.1/9.1/7.5 + 0800 + 2636 & 116.4 & ic 0486 & 0504101201 & 2007 - 10 - 28 & 21.6/21.6/20.1 + 0804 + 2345 & 125.3 & 2masx j0804 + 2345 & 0504102101 & 2007 - 11 - 09 & 22.6/22.6/20.4 + 0824 + 2959 & 107.6 & iras f08216 + 3009 & 0504102001 & 2007 - 11 - 03 & 23.4/23.4/21.8 + 0959 + 1259 & 147.4 & cgcg 064 - 017 & 0504100201 & 2007 - 11 - 25 & 21.6/21.6/20.0 + 1018 + 3722 & 214.9 & 2masx j1018 + 3722 & 0504101701 & 2007 - 05 - 18 & 23.2/23.2/18.8 + 1111 + 0228 & 151.9 & 2masx j1111 + 0228 & 0504101801 & 2007 - 06 - 10 & 24.0/24.0/22.6 + 1123 + 4703 & 107.6 & cgcg 242 - 028 & 0504101301 & 2007 - 06 - 11 & 19.5/19.8/4.0 + 1136 + 5657 & 224.0 & mcg + 10 - 17 - 021 &",

    "<S> the majority of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) suffer from significant obscuration by surrounding dust and gas . </S>",
    "<S> the penetrating power and sensitivity of hard x - ray observations allows obscured agn to be probed out to high redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> however , x - ray surveys in the 2 - 10 kev band will miss the most heavily - obscured agn in which the absorbing column density exceeds @xmath0@xmath1 ( the compton - thick agn ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore vital to know the fraction of agn that are missed in such x - rays surveys and to determine if these agn represent some distinct population in terms of the fundamental properties of agn and/or their host galaxies . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we present the analysis of _ xmm - newton _ x - ray data for a complete sample of 17 low - redshift type 2 seyfert galaxies chosen from the sloan digital sky survey based solely on the high observed flux of the [ oiii]@xmath25007 emission - line . </S>",
    "<S> this line is formed in the narrow line region hundreds of parsecs away from the central engine . </S>",
    "<S> thus , unlike the x - ray emission , it is not affected by obscuration due to the torus surrounding the black hole . </S>",
    "<S> it therefore provides a useful isotropic indicator of the agn luminosity . as additional indicators of the intrinsic agn luminosity , we use the spitzer space telescope to measure the luminosities of the mid - infrared continuum and the [ oiv]25.89@xmath3 m narrow emission - line . </S>",
    "<S> we then use the ratio of the 2 - 10 kev x - ray luminosity to the [ oiii ] , [ oiv ] , and mid - infrared luminosities to assess the amount of x - ray obscuration and to distinguish between compton - thick and compton - thin objects . </S>",
    "<S> the various diagnostics of agn luminosity with heavily obscured hard x - ray emission are in broad agreement . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the majority of the sources suffer significant amounts of obscuration : the observed 2 - 10 kev emission is depressed by more than an order - of - magnitude in 11 of the 17 cases ( as expected for compton - thick sources ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , surveys in the rest - frame 2 - 10 kev band will be significantly incomplete for obscured agn . </S>",
    "<S> we find a strong inverse correlation between the ratio of the 2 - 10 kev x - ray and [ oiii ] ( or [ oiv ] or mid - ir ) fluxes and the equivalent width of the 6.4 kev fe k@xmath4 line . </S>",
    "<S> this demonstrates that the weak hard x - ray continuum emission is due to obscuration ( rather than to intrinsically weak emission ) . in several cases </S>",
    "<S> the large amount of obscuration is not consistent with the values of absorbing column density derived from simple spectral fits to the data . </S>",
    "<S> we run simulations of a more physically realistic model with partial covering of the x - ray source plus compton scattering , and show that such models are consistent with the data . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the distribution of obscuration in the 2 - 10 kev band in our sample is similar to what is seen in samples selected in the _ swift _ bat energy - band ( 14 - 195 kev ) . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the bat surveys do recover a significant fraction of the local population of compton - thick agn . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we find no relationship between the amount of x - ray obscuration and the other properties of the agn and its host galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> hence , compton - thick and compton - thin sources do not seem to trace distinct populations . </S>"
