    "the theory of quantum plasma is currently rapidly expanding as a result of its potential applications ranging from micro - electronic @xcite to laser - plasma interaction @xcite or astrophysics @xcite .",
    "since the derivation of the quantum fluid equations @xcite , many well known classical plasmas effects including plasmas oscillations with or without magnetic field @xcite , plasma instabilities @xcite , solitons and vortices @xcite , or turbulence @xcite , have been re - examined in their quantum version .    beyond their potential applications ,",
    "many of these problems present a fundamental interest as they form the basis for the general theory of quantum plasmas . among them ,",
    "the quantum version of the two - stream instability is endorsing the rle its classical counterpart plays with classical plasma : that of a fundamental process worthy of investigation in itself , and included in every plasma physics textbook . since the first works on the quantum two - stream instability",
    ", it has been recognized that one of the most striking difference between the quantum and the classical treatment of this process is that the quantum version displays two unstable branches instead of only one for the classical case @xcite .",
    "kinetic treatment are now available showing that thermal spread can suppress both quantum branches @xcite , as they do with the single unstable branch in the classical case .",
    "while unstable quantum modes in counter - streaming beams systems have been assessed for modes with wave vector aligned ( two - stream ) or perpendicular ( filamentation @xcite ) with the streams , intermediate orientations have not been considered yet .",
    "the intent of this paper is precisely to fill this gap . as a result",
    ", an interesting conclusion is reached : the two branches of the quantum two - stream instability are indeed connected with each other . by letting the wave vector acquire a perpendicular component",
    ", we found a continuum of unstable modes bridging the two quantum branches across the @xmath1 space .",
    "we here derive the dispersion equation for arbitrarily oriented wave vector . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "we deal with the generic system formed by two cold counter - streaming electron beams of equal density @xmath2 and opposite velocities @xmath3 .",
    "ions form a fixed neutralizing background with density @xmath4 and there s no background magnetic field .",
    "the dispersion equation is derived from maxwell s equations and from the quantum fluid equations for the two electrons species , @xmath5 and , @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the electron charge and mass respectively .",
    "the subscripts `` + '' and `` - '' stand here for the electron population going to the positive and negative directions respectively .",
    "these equations are now linearized perturbing every quantity with a term proportional to @xmath9 , where @xmath10 .",
    "the linearized mass conservation equation yields straightforwardly , @xmath11 while the linearized quantum euler equation reads , @xmath12 while flow aligned unstable modes ( @xmath13 ) are exactly electrostatic with @xmath14 , such is not the case for a general orientation of the wave vector .",
    "this is why the exact calculation requires a lorentz force term .",
    "although some approximations will be used in the sequel to analyze the problem , we first outline the exact one .     in terms of @xmath15 for @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",

    "the first order magnetic field is then eliminated through the maxwell - faraday equation @xmath21 so that the first order current @xmath22 , can eventually be expressed in terms of @xmath19 only .",
    "combining now maxwell - faraday and maxwell - ampre equations gives , @xmath23 from which the formal dispersion relation is finally derived , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the dielectric tensor .",
    "the dispersion equation derived from eq .",
    "( [ eq : disperformal ] ) is very involved and will not be reproduced here .",
    "instead , we now introduce the very simple longitudinal approximation which , in the classical case , has been found worthy over the full wave - vectors spectrum except near the perpendicular direction @xcite . the dispersion equation for longitudinal waves reads @xcite , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the distribution function of each beam . with @xmath28 ,",

    "as expected , the exact calculation displays unstable filamentation modes for @xmath35 which are bypassed by the approximation .",
    "apart for the quasi normal wave vectors , the approximation is very good , and even exact for @xmath36 .",
    "the most striking features here is the connection of the two two - stream branches along the flow axis @xmath37 .",
    "when restricting the calculation to this axis , these two branches seem disconnected . after extending the analysis for arbitrarily oriented wave vectors",
    ", we now see that there is a continuum of unstable modes bridging between them .     as a function of @xmath38 for @xmath17 and @xmath39.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]",
    "an analytical analysis of the dispersion function for @xmath40 is possible and allows for an analytical characterization of the bridge between the two - stream branches . for the sake of the discussion",

    "figure [ fig:2 ] pictures the growth rate as a function of @xmath38 in this direction .",
    "figures [ fig:3 ] now display the behavior of the dispersion function for @xmath42 ( stable ) , @xmath43 ( unstable ) and @xmath44 ( stable ) .",
    "the stability of the system can be explained from the respective position of the singularities of the dispersion function . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : longi ] ) , these singularities read , @xmath45    for @xmath42 in fig .",

    "the ordering of the singularities is still the same , but @xmath48 , rendering the system unstable .",
    "finally , for @xmath44 , the ordering is @xmath49 , namely , @xmath50 and @xmath51 switched their positions .",
    "the stability in this case is necessary from the behavior of the dispersion function near its singularities .",
    "when their order is the one of fig .",
    "[ fig:3]c , i.e. `` 1,3,2,4 '' , the dispersion equation necessarily crosses the @xmath52 axis 4 times and the 4th degree dispersion equation has therefore only purely real roots . if the ordering is `` 1,2,3,4 '' , like the one found for @xmath42 or 3 , stability relies on the sign of @xmath53 . from figs .",
