    "geometrical concepts play a central role in our theoretical descriptions of the fundamental properties of elementary particles and the spacetime arena within which they interact .",
    "the advent of string theory has reinforced this reliance on geometrical methods ; it has done so , though , with a fascinating twist .",
    "string theory _ necessitates _ the introduction of particular modifications of standard geometrical constructions which can drastically modify their properties when the typical length scales involved approach planckian values .",
    "conversely , when all length scales involved are large compared to the planck scale , these modified geometrical constructs approach their classical counterparts .",
    "this phenomenon of string deformed classical geometry is usually referred to as `` quantum geometry '' ( although `` stringy geometry '' might be more accurate since our concern will be exclusively at string tree level ) .",
    "recently @xcite , a striking property of quantum geometry was uncovered in the context of string theory compactified on a   space .",
    "a classical analysis instructs us to limit our attention to riemannian metrics on such a space  that is , to positive definite bilinear forms mapping @xmath2 to @xmath3 .",
    "as  spaces are khler , this condition can be rephrased as the statement that the khler form on the  space @xmath4 lies in a subset of @xmath5 known as the khler cone",
    ". however , an analysis based on string theory reveals a different story .",
    "namely , it was shown in @xcite that the physics of string theory continues to make perfect sense even if we allow the `` khler form '' to take values outside of the khler cone .",
    "this was shown , for example , to give rise to physical processes resulting in a change in the topology of the  target space  processes which classical reasoning would forbid .    another striking aspect of quantum geometry is the apparent existence of a minimum length set by the string scale @xmath6 . the evidence for this has come from a variety of studies .",
    "first , it has long been known @xcite that string theory compactified on a circle of radius @xmath7 is physically identical to the theory compactified on a circle of radius @xmath8 .",
    "the full set of physically distinct possibilities with this topology is therefore parameterized by radii @xmath7 varying from @xmath9 to @xmath10 ; in this sense @xmath9 is a minimum length in this setting .",
    "additional evidence for a minimum length was given in @xcite in which the one dimensional space of khler forms on the quintic threefold was studied by means of mirror symmetry .",
    "those authors found that physically distinct theories are again characterized by khler forms which attain a minimal nonzero volume . from another point of view",
    ", the work of @xcite showed that there appears to be a smallest length scale that can be probed via high energy scattering with an extended object such as a string .",
    "roughly , unlike what happens in the point particle case , increasing the energy of the string probe beyond a critical value results in an increase in the size of the probe itself and hence a _ decrease _ in the length scale of sensitivity .    at first sight , the observations in the last two paragraphs might seem to be at odds .",
    "on the one hand , we have mentioned work which establishes that string theory _ relaxes _ constraints on the  metric and hence makes all of @xmath5 available for consistent physical models . on the other hand ,",
    "we have referred to work which establishes that string theory _ restricts _ the physically realizable metrics to a subset of those which are classically allowed .",
    "one of the main purposes of the present paper is to study this issue in some detail and show the harmonious coexistence of these apparently divergent statements .    as part of the analysis in the sequel",
    "is somewhat technical , it is worthwhile for us to briefly summarize our results here .",
    "to do so , let us first recall that in @xcite it was shown that string theory instructs us to pass from the moduli space of khler forms on a single  space to the _ enlarged _ khler moduli space .",
    "the latter is a space which comes equipped with a decomposition into cells , each of which corresponds to a different `` phase '' of the @xmath11 superconformal theory ( see figure [ fig : fo ] ) . from a mathematical point of view",
    ", one might say the walls between these cells correspond to khler forms which degenerate in some manner .",
    "some of these phases are interpretable in terms of strings on ( birationally equivalent but possibly topologically distinct ) smooth  manifolds , some other phases correspond to strings on singular ( orbifold )  spaces and yet other phases include landau - ginzburg theories and exotic hybrid combinations . more precisely , each cell contains a neighbourhood of a distinguished `` limit '' point ( marked with a dot in figure [ fig : fo ] ) around which some kind of perturbation theory converges and the above identifications can unambiguously be made .",
    "( for the calabi - yau phases , these are known as `` large radius limit '' points . )",
    "the region of convergence is shown by a dotted line in figure [ fig : fo ] .",
    "a generic path in this enlarged khler moduli space corresponds to a family of well defined conformal theories and hence there is no obstruction to passing from one cell into another .",
    "this gives rise to the topology changing transitions mentioned earlier . under mirror symmetry , this enlarged khler moduli space corresponds to the complex structure moduli space of the mirror .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the badly behaved conformal field theories form a subspace of _ complex _ codimension one ( as opposed to the _ real _ codimension one walls in the khler space ) in an appropriate compactification of the moduli space , which under mirror symmetry corresponds to the `` discriminant locus '' of the complex structure moduli space .",
    "as this locus has real codimension two , a generic path in that moduli space avoids it .",
    "this is , in fact , how we established that the same must be true for a generic path in the enlarged khler moduli space of the original  manifold .    taking this picture at face value",
    ", it appears that some points in figure 1 correspond to khler forms with zero or even negative volumes ( since we pass outside of a single classical khler cone ) .",
    "one superficial way of treating this is simply to assert that a geometrical interpretation can only be given to a subset of points in the moduli space  those points with a large positive volume according to some birational model of the space .",
    "although that point of view avoids the obvious difficulties about negative volumes , our goal in this paper is to probe the issue more deeply and determine to what extent we can give a consistent geometrical interpretation ( and hence assign a positive volume ) to all points in the enlarged moduli space .",
    "a crucial ingredient in such a study is the precise definition of `` volume '' or `` size '' in the conformal field theory context . as the size of a space is an inherently classical mathematical notion",
    ", there is no unique way of extending its definition to quantum geometry .",
    "there are , however , a couple of compelling extensions which are both natural from the point of view of conformal field theory and which reduce to the standard notion of size in the appropriate large radius limits .",
    "one of these extensions relies upon mirror symmetry to rewrite the moduli space of khler forms on @xmath4 as the moduli space of complex structures of another space @xmath12 .",
    "the coordinates in this moduli space ( which are coupling constants in the action of the associated conformal field theory ) are then used to represent the size of @xmath4 in the simplest possible way ( as we will discuss ) .",
    "this turns out to be equivalent to measuring `` size '' by using the classical khler form on the nonconformal linear  which was studied in @xcite .",
    "the second version of size is derived directly from properties of the conformal nonlinear .",
    "this definition can be obtained by requiring that it not only approach the notion of size based upon the classical khler form at the large radius limit , but also that it exactly match that notion in a certain neighbourhood of this limit .",
    "( this neighbourhood will be the region in which we can , at least in principle , calculate the conformal  correlation functions and thus use the  as the link between points in the moduli space and the geometry of @xmath4 . )",
    "the measurement of size is then analytically continued in a natural way beyond this neighbourhood of the large radius limit point . in practice",
    "we will analyze this second definition of size by means of the first definition in the preceding paragraph , and of a function which relates the two sizes .",
    "this function can be expressed in terms of solutions to a set of differential equations  the picard - fuchs equations .",
    "the `` sizes '' on which we focus in this paper will be described by specifying an area for every holomorphically embedded riemann surface @xmath13 in @xmath4 , or more generally , for every @xmath14-cycle @xmath13 on @xmath4 .",
    "we will refer to such a specification of areas as a _ measure _ on @xmath4 , and we will give precise definitions of the `` '' ( the first notion of size ) and the `` '' ( the second notion of size ) later in the paper .",
    "the areas that we specify only depend on the homology class of the riemann surface .",
    "if we choose @xmath14-cycles @xmath15 forming an integral basis of @xmath16 , and let @xmath17 be the dual basis of @xmath18 then associating something like a complexified khler form @xmath19 to each conformal field theory in the moduli space , we see @xmath20 one should note that although our moduli space usually contains theories corresponding to many topologically distinct birational models of @xmath4 , we can sensibly define @xmath16 across the whole moduli space .",
    "when we do this for a riemann surface @xmath15 which has positive area in the neighbourhood of the large radius limit of one model @xmath21 , the same riemann surface @xmath15 may have negative area near the large radius limit of some other model @xmath22 .",
    "this happens for the @xmath23 s which are flopped when passing between these models @xcite .",
    "thus what we consider to be positive or negative area depends on which @xmath24 we use as our starting point .",
    "one of the results strongly indicated ( but not fully proven ) by the present work is that for _ any _ point @xmath25 representing a conformal field theory , the associated areas are non - negative when we calculate them using the for a suitable choice of @xmath24 .",
    "_ in other words , every conformal field theory in the enlarged khler moduli space has non - negative areas with respect to the large radius definition of size specified by at least one of the smooth birational models of @xmath4 ( and the method of continuation given above ) .",
    "_ this is the resolution of the apparent conflict mentioned above that we put forth here ( and is pictorially illustrated later in figure  [ fig : mush ] ) .",
    "notice that this representation of the enlarged khler moduli space still has all of the phases which string theory instructs us to include ( thereby enlarging the classical khler moduli space of a single smooth  manifold ) but that on the union of these phase regions , the areas are constrained to be larger than certain minimum values ( thereby reducing the classical khler moduli space ) .",
    "we note that the first evidence for this conclusion in the  context can be extracted from @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , the analog of figure 1 for the enlarged khler moduli space on the quintic threefold is a @xmath23 divided into two cells by the equator , with north and south poles removed .",
    "this can be thought of as arising from @xmath26 in the natural exponential coordinates @xcite where , as dictated by string theory , we place no restriction on the one dimensional imaginary part of this expression .",
    "the description of @xcite then shows that the upper hemisphere ( including arbitrary positive imaginary values in @xmath27 ) corresponds to the smooth  phase while the lower hemisphere ( including arbitrary negative imaginary values in @xmath27 ) corresponds to the landau - ginzburg phase .",
    "the analysis of @xcite , however , shows that if we use the  definition of size ( based on analytically continuing the khler form from the smooth  region as indicated above ) , there is a positive lower limit on the size for all conformal theories in this enlarged moduli space . in the present work",
    "we extend this notion to more complicated moduli spaces which exhibit many qualitatively new features .",
    "some of the regions of the moduli space we will explore can also be described in terms of classical ideas of general relativity .",
    "we will compare the classical version with the stringy description obtained in this paper .    in section [ s : ls ] we will review the local structure of the moduli spaces of interest to this work .",
    "this analysis will tell us how to describe the khler moduli space in terms of the algebraic structure of the underlying conformal field theory  effectively by using mirror symmetry . in section [ s : gs ]",
    "we will look at the global structure of the resulting moduli space .",
    "the discussion here will complement that of @xcite  in which toric methods were used to describe the enlarged khler moduli space ( and by mirror symmetry complex structure moduli space as well ) . here",
    "our discussion will also use toric methods , but will naturally originate in complex structure moduli space . in particular , we will see that the discriminant locus ( which may be thought of as the subspace of `` bad '' conformal field theories ) is closely related to a fan structure which in turn provides data for a natural compactification of the moduli space .    in section [ s : coord ] we will discuss various ways of defining the `` size '' of a conformal field theory .",
    "mathematically , this amounts to putting coordinates on the enlarged khler moduli space to determine a way of measuring areas at each point of the moduli space .",
    "it will be seen that two notions of area measurement arise .",
    "the first notion comes from the natural coordinates that were put on the moduli space in its algebraic toric construction .",
    "as we shall mention , these are also the coordinates which naturally arise in the @xmath0=2 supersymmetric gauge theories employed in @xcite .",
    "the other method of area measurement comes directly from the khler form of the  as sketched above .",
    "the main quantitative portion of the present work concerns presenting methods for the calculation of this  in section [ s : meas ] for various boundary or limit points of the enlarged khler moduli space . by studying these extreme points in the moduli space",
    "we anticipate that our calculations will be sensitive to the extreme values of volumes that can physically arise . in section",
    "[ s : conc ] we discuss the consequences of these calculations and present concluding remarks .",
    "in much of what follows in both this and subsequent sections , we will use the tool of mirror symmetry and freely interchange one perspective with that of the mirror . to avoid confusion when we do so ,",
    "let us state our notation clearly at the outset .",
    "let @xmath4 and @xmath12 be a mirror pair of  manifolds .",
    "the mirror map takes ( chiral , chiral)-fields into ( antichiral , chiral)- fields and vice versa . for both @xmath4 and @xmath12",
    ", we will associate deformations of the complex structure with deformations of the ring of ( chiral , chiral)-fields , and thus associate deformations of the khler form with deformations of the ring of ( antichiral , chiral)-fields . since we ultimately wish to focus on deformations of the khler form of @xmath4 in the later sections we use @xmath28 to denote an ( antichiral , chiral)-field in the @xmath4 model and @xmath29 to denote a ( chiral , chiral)-field in the same model .",
    "these are reversed by the mirror map for the @xmath12 model .",
    "this notation is summarized in table [ tab : c ] .",
    ".notation for the fields generating the deformations of [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the mirror pair of  manifolds @xmath4 and @xmath12 .",
    "[ tab : c ]    we begin with the nonlinear  given by embeddings , @xmath30 , of a riemann surface @xmath31 into a compact khler manifold @xmath12 of complex dimension 3 : @xmath32 where @xmath33 are holomorphic coordinates on @xmath12 pulled back to @xmath31 and @xmath34 are the components of the pull - back of the khler form .",
    "the @xmath35-field is a closed real 2-form on @xmath12 .",
    "we will assume that @xmath36 so that the cohomology class of any closed 2-form @xmath35 can be represented as a @xmath37-form @xmath38 .",
    "( in ( [ eq : sm ] ) we also use @xmath39 to indicate the pull - back to @xmath31 of the components of @xmath35 . ) the extra degrees of freedom introduced by the @xmath35-field appear to be essential to fully understand the structure of the moduli space of this .",
    "this  may be made into an @xmath0=2 field theory by introducing for each @xmath40 a chiral superfield ( in both the left - moving and right - moving sense ) on @xmath31 , @xmath28 , whose lowest component is @xmath33 . introducing superspace coordinates @xmath41 for left - movers and @xmath42 for right - movers one can show that @xcite the following action @xmath43 yields ( [ eq : sm ] ) as its bosonic part if @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath45 is a real symmetric function of @xmath28 and @xmath46 , defined only locally on the target space .",
    "the field theory given by ( [ eq : sm2 ] ) is not necessarily conformally invariant .",
    "the conditions for conformal invariance can be studied @xcite by means of  perturbation theory where one assumes that @xmath47 , where @xmath7 is some characteristic radius of @xmath12 .",
    "this condition is called the `` large radius limit '' and its precise meaning should become clear later in this paper . to leading order in @xmath48",
    "one finds that conformal invariance can be achieved if @xmath35 is harmonic and @xmath34 is ricci - flat .",
    "thus @xmath12 is a  manifold .    given any large radius  manifold we can therefore associate to it a conformal field theory given by ( [ eq : sm2 ] ) .",
    "the chiral fields @xmath28 of this theory have simple multiplication properties @xcite since one is free to make nave definitions such as @xmath49 this simple structure for the algebra of the fields @xmath28 is the key to being able to use the algebraic methods later in this paper . in this paper",
    "we will often abuse notation and use @xmath28 to represent what is really its lowest component @xmath33 .",
    "this is because the algebraic structure in the conformal field theory given by ( [ eq : cr1 ] ) directly translates into a statement about complex coordinates in algebraic geometry .",
    "the moduli space of these theories can now be analyzed locally as was done in @xcite .",
    "the key point is that the moduli space naturally splits into a product of two factors .",
    "deformations of the metric , @xmath34 can be divided into two types .",
    "firstly there are deformations of the complex structure of @xmath12 .",
    "these do not preserve the ( 1,1)-type of @xmath34 and introduce @xmath50 and @xmath51 components .",
    "such deformations form a moduli space of complex dimension @xmath52 .",
    "the deformations of the metric that preserve its ( 1,1)-type can be combined with deformations of @xmath35 to form the other factor in the moduli space . this part of the moduli space can be regarded as the set of `` complexified khler forms '' @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the khler form associated to @xmath34 , and it has complex dimension @xmath55 .",
    "we will tend to drop the word `` complexified '' and refer to the combination @xmath56 itself as the `` khler form '' on @xmath12 .",
    "we will also fix our units of length so that @xmath57 . note then that changing @xmath35 by adding an element of @xmath58 to it will have no effect on the field theory given by ( [ eq : sm2 ] ) and so @xmath56 is best thought of as an element of the quotient space @xmath59 .    as an alternative to describing everything in terms of the intrinsic geometry of @xmath12 , in some cases one can embed @xmath12 as a hypersurface in an ambient space with simpler geometric properties .",
    "this will allow us to go some way to naturally splitting the deformations of complex structure and khler form in terms of the action .",
    "consider the action ( [ eq : sm2 ] ) on some space @xmath60 with the addition of other terms : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a new chiral superfield and @xmath63 is a holomorphic function .",
    "this action also has @xmath0=2 supersymmetry .",
    "since no world - sheet derivatives of the field @xmath62 appear we may integrate it out from its equations of motion . integrating out the lowest component of @xmath62 forces the condition @xmath64",
    "let us call the subspace of @xmath60 given by ( [ eq : cond ] ) the space @xmath12 .",
    "integrating out the fermionic components of @xmath62 forces the fermionic components of @xmath28 to lie in the tangent bundle of the space @xmath12 defined by ( [ eq : cond ] ) . and integrating out the highest component of @xmath62 introduces an extrinsic curvature term which along with the curvature of @xmath60 produces the curvature of @xmath12 much along the lines of @xcite .",
    "thus one sees that the field theory given by ( [ eq : smc ] ) on @xmath60 is equivalent to ( [ eq : sm2 ] ) on @xmath65 .",
    "it follows that the condition for conformal invariance of ( [ eq : smc ] ) to leading order is that the subspace @xmath12 ( rather than @xmath60 ) should be ricci - flat .",
    "indeed , one approach @xcite ( coming from the ideas of @xcite ) to obtaining a conformal field theory from this construction is to put no condition on the metric on @xmath60 and then consider the conformal field theory as the infra - red renormalized limit of ( [ eq : smc ] ) .    in many cases",
    "all of the deformations of the complex structure of @xmath12 can now be considered as deformations of the function @xmath63 rather than of the metric on the ambient space .",
    "since this is an algebraic question we have simplified the problem .",
    "in general one might have some deformations of complex structure which can not be expressed as deformations of @xmath63 @xcite and we will indeed be treating examples where this does happen .",
    "in such a case we will ignore those `` extra '' deformations and so we will only really be treating a slice of the moduli space .",
    "there are examples known @xcite where a topological class of a manifold can be treated by more than one model of the form ( [ eq : smc ] ) .",
    "it can turn out @xcite that in one model some deformations of complex structure can be thought of deformations of @xmath63 whereas in another model the same deformations can not . because of this fact one would expect that there is nothing special about the deformations we are ignoring and that we should be able to see all the salient properties of the moduli space by just looking at the slice of @xmath63-type deformations .",
    "consider the case where @xmath60 is a complex projective space with , say , the fubini - study metric .",
    "the infra - red limit of the action ( [ eq : smc ] ) describes a conformal  on the projective variety @xmath12 .",
    "note however that the @xmath28 s are affine rather than homogeneous coordinates on @xmath60 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that a change of variables can absorb @xmath62 into the superpotential @xmath63 and turn the affine coordinates into homogeneous coordinates .",
    "such a change of variables also produced a discrete group of identifications such that the action ( [ eq : smc ] ) is an orbifold of the equivalent action written in homogeneous coordinates .",
    "similar results are also obtained when @xmath60 is a weighted projective space ( or even a more general toric variety ) and the resulting @xmath28 coordinates are quasi - homogeneous coordinates . from now on , to improve notation , we will rewrite the coordinates @xmath28 as @xmath66 . since these will always be coordinates in some flat affine space (",
    "of which the weighted projective space or toric variety is a quotient @xcite ) , no confusion should arise .",
    "recently , witten @xcite  has analyzed calabi - yau s and their relationship to landau - ginzburg theories .",
    "this analysis has played a crucial role in understanding the phase structure of these theories as discussed in our introductory remarks .",
    "it also helps to clarify why algebraic methods suffice for understanding particular sectors of moduli space , as we now indicate .    in witten s approach ,",
    "one begins with the action for an @xmath0=2 supersymmetric two dimensional quantum field theory with a nontrivial gauge group , which for ease of exposition we temporarily take to be @xmath67 .",
    "the action for this theory is @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 ( the fayet - illiopoulos @xmath71-term ) are functions which we will not concern ourselves with in this paper .",
    "one can then study this theory for various values of the parameter @xmath72 .",
    "as shown in @xcite , for @xmath73 large and positive , this theory is a   on the  space given by @xmath74 in a suitable weighted projective space .",
    "for @xmath73 large ( in absolute value ) and negative , the theory is interpretable as an orbifold of a landau - ginzburg theory with superpotential @xmath75 . in the infra - red limit",
    ", these quantum field theories are expected to become conformal sigma models and conformal landau - ginzburg theories , respectively .",
    "mathematically , the physical construction just reviewed corresponds to building various target spaces via symplectic quotients @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath73 can then be interpreted as setting the size , or more precisely , the khler form on the resulting space . in more general examples",
    "@xcite , the number of @xmath76 parameters equals the dimension of @xmath77 of the associated  space.s equals the dimension of that part of @xmath78 which arises from the ambient variety @xmath60 .",
    "] one of the results of the present study is to make geometrical sense of such `` khler forms '' which a superficial analysis suggests will become negative on part of the parameter space .",
    "we will return to a discussion of the @xmath76 coordinates and these issues shortly .    as is well known @xcite , at the conformal limit ,",
    "some of the equations of motion of ( [ eq : lg ] ) yield @xmath79 the important point for our purposes is that if we assume that all the deformations of the complex structure of @xmath12 are encoded in the function @xmath80 , we can study the complex structure moduli space using algebraic methods .",
    "namely , the fields @xmath66 obey the multiplication rules of the chiral ring @xcite @xmath81}{\\left(\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x_0},\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x_1},\\ldots\\right)},\\ ] ] where @xmath82 represents the ideal generated by @xmath83 . in the case that @xmath12 is 3-dimensional",
    ", this ring encodes much of the information concerning the 3-point functions in the conformal field theory .    because the @xmath66 are ( quasi-)homogeneous coordinates , or equivalently because they are charged under the @xmath67 symmetries of the @xmath0=(2,2 ) algebra , the ring @xmath84 is graded .",
    "elements of the ring with left and right charge ( 1,1 ) may be added to @xmath80 in the action ( [ eq : lg ] ) to give another valid theory .",
    "such fields thus form truly marginal operators",
    ".    we will now attempt to describe the deformations of khler form in the same language .",
    "we will begin by describing the deformations of the complex structure of a  threefold @xmath4 by describing @xmath4 as the zero locus of a holomorphic function @xmath85 in some ambient space .",
    "( this @xmath4 will eventually turn out to be the mirror partner of the @xmath12 above , which is why we have switched to @xmath86 to denote the ( chiral , chiral ) fields . )",
    "to be concrete let us focus on the example given by @xmath87 this example will be used repeatedly throughout this paper to illustrate various points although , as will be apparent , the key results are general . by the arguments of @xcite",
    "this corresponds to the gepner model @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "there is a 76-dimensional vector space in @xmath84 of fields we can add to this action as marginal operators .",
    "the space is generated by fields such as @xmath89 , @xmath90 , etc . when moving to affine",
    "coordinates the landau - ginzburg theory is orbifolded by the @xmath91 action @xmath92\\mapsto[\\alpha^6y_0,\\alpha^6y_1 ,      \\alpha^3y_2,\\alpha^2y_3,\\alpha y_4],\\qquad      \\alpha = e^{2\\pi i/18}.\\ ] ] when we orbifold the conformal field theory by this action we expect to obtain a point somewhere in the moduli space of theories of s on the hypersurface @xmath4 given by the zero locus of ( [ eq : lge ] ) in the weighted projective space @xmath93 .",
    "this orbifold theory gives 3 twisted truly marginal operators in superfields of charge ( 1,1 ) that represent 3 deformations of complex structure of @xmath4 that can not be given in terms of @xmath85 .",
    "further analysis of the resulting orbifold also yields more truly marginal operators , this time in superfields with charge ( @xmath94,1 ) .",
    "there are 7 of these .",
    "analysis of the gepner model shows that 5 of these can be written in the following form : @xmath95 where @xmath66 is a superfield on @xmath4 , this time _",
    "antichiral _ in the left sector but chiral in the right sector , with the same @xmath67 charges as @xmath96 except that the left - moving charge s sign is reversed .",
    "thus if we use the notation @xmath97 for the landau - ginzburg action ( the action at the gepner point ) we can represent deformations of this action by @xmath98 where @xmath99 is a linear combination of the 76 marginal operators given by monomials in @xmath86 and @xmath80 is a linear combination of the fields in ( [ eq : tmo ] ) .",
    "this gives a ( 76 + 5)-dimensional slice of the ( 79 + 7)-dimensional complete moduli space .",
    "these marginal operators written as polynomials in @xmath66 represent deformations of the khler form as was shown in @xcite .",
    "thus having formed an algebraic structure to describe the moduli space of complex structures by embedding @xmath4 in some ambient space , by going to the gepner point in moduli space we see a similar structure on the moduli space of khler forms .",

    "as shown in @xcite one can take an orbifold of the gepner model to reverse the sign of right - moving @xmath67-charge ; in the present formulation , this amounts to exchanging the geometrical rles of @xmath66 and @xmath96 in ( [ eq : defs ] ) .",

    "thus we arrive at the conclusion that we can study ( part of ) the khler moduli space of the  space @xmath4 corresponding to the hypersurface given by the zero locus of ( [ eq : lge ] ) in @xmath93 by considering an orbifold of the theory given by @xmath105",
    "in this section we shall describe the global structure of the enlarged moduli space of khler forms on the  space @xmath4 .",

    "we shall study this moduli space using a complimentary approach which focuses on the complex structure moduli space of @xmath12 , to which it is isomorphic by mirror symmetry .",
    "we will freely interchange the words `` khler moduli space of @xmath4 '' with `` complex structure moduli space of @xmath12 '' , via this isomorphism .",
    "we will consider the function @xmath106 if we put @xmath107 then we recover the superpotential of ( [ eq : lgp ] ) and we may use the 5 complex numbers @xmath108 to parameterize the moduli space of khler forms on @xmath4 . in this paper",
    "however we are particularly interested in the _ global _ form of the moduli space and the act of setting @xmath107 would exclude certain limit points from our moduli space .",
    "given the fact that the scaling @xmath109 is nothing more than a reparametrization of the theory one can immediately see that we have a @xmath110 group of symmetries of this family of theories .",

    "setting @xmath117 for example would not be enough since it still leaves a residual @xmath91 group of reparametrization symmetries .",
    "this is in fact the origin of the `` extra '' discrete symmetries of moduli spaces which have often been encountered in explicit examples @xcite .",

    "we have implicitly included points at which the hypersurface defined by ( [ eq : gen ] ) acquires extra singularities , and such points do not belong in the moduli space .",
    "our strategy now is to enlarge @xmath116 to a compact space @xmath118 , and then to analyze the locus within @xmath118 which corresponds to the set of `` bad '' conformal field theories .",
    "removing that locus from @xmath118 would then produce the actual moduli space .    adding in points to compactify @xmath116 to a space @xmath118 is far from a unique process .",

    "it was shown that the set of cones one naturally uses to compactify ( [ eq : mod0 ] ) are given by some generalized notion of the khler cones of @xmath4 and its relatives . in this section",
    "we will motivate this collection of cones in a different manner  namely in terms of the natural structure of the complex structure moduli space of @xmath12 .      for fixed values of @xmath122 , ",
    ", @xmath123 , the zero locus of ( [ eq : gen ] ) defines a hypersurface @xmath12 in a toric variety .",
    "this toric variety can be represented as an orbifold of @xmath93 by the group ( [ eq : morb ] ) , or it can be represented more directly through toric constructions as discussed in @xcite .",
    "consider the case that there is a solution to the set of equations @xmath124 ( this should be contrasted to ( [ eq : eom ] ) which is a statement about the _ operators _ @xmath66 .",

    "_ @xmath66 . )",
    "if this condition holds for some point @xmath125 ( but not for all points in @xmath12 ) then @xmath12 will be singular at @xmath126 .",
    "if ( [ eq : d1 ] ) has no solution then @xmath12 is smooth ( except for quotient singularities inherited from the ambient toric variety ) .    clearly the condition that ( [ eq : d1 ] ) has a solution is an algebraic problem and should be expressible in terms of a condition on the coefficients @xmath112 .",
    "the locus of points satisfying this condition form a subspace in @xmath118 which is called the `` discriminant locus '' .    if one tries to construct a conformal field theory corresponding to a point in the discriminant locus one runs into difficulties .",
    "when @xmath12 is smooth , the chiral ring @xmath84 is well - behaved in the sense that it is generated as a vector space by a finite number of elements .",
    "these elements correspond to the chiral primary fields of the conformal field theory .",
    "when one moves onto the discriminant locus , the chiral ring `` explodes '' in the sense that it now appears to give an infinite number of chiral primary fields .",
    "when one tries to use the ring to calculate 3-point functions one also runs in to trouble . indeed if one tries to associate a conformal field theory to such a point one appears to demand that at least some 3-point functions are infinite .",
    "thus , the discriminant locus may be thought of as the subspace of `` bad '' theories .",
    "it may be that there is some way of taming such theories , indeed many of the points we will consider which are added to @xmath116 to form @xmath118 will be in the discriminant locus and we will be able to remove the infinities . for points on the discriminant locus within @xmath116",
    "however one must resolve questions such as the conformal field theory description of the conifold transitions of @xcite and such conformal field theories would appear to be necessarily badly behaved in some sense .",
    "for all but the simplest examples , the discriminant locus is very complicated . in our example",
    "we will not be able to calculate the full discriminant but we will be able to obtain much of the information we need to study the global structure of the moduli space .",
    "the method we will follow is that presented in @xcite .",
    "first let us look at the condition that ( [ eq : d1 ] ) has a solution for @xmath127 .",
    "this can be written in the form @xmath128 where @xmath129 , called the _",
    "regular discriminant _ , is some polynomial function of the @xmath112 s .",
    "the regular discriminant locus thus obtained is part of the discriminant locus we want within @xmath118 .",
    "the parts we have missed are , of course , the points for which ( [ eq : d1 ] ) is satisfied only when at least one of the @xmath66 s vanish .",
    "the work of @xcite then proceeds as follows .",
    "first we need to introduce the _ newton polytope _ for ( [ eq : gen ] ) .",
    "this was done in @xcite but we will repeat the main points here . consider representing the monomial @xmath130 by the point @xmath131 in @xmath132 .",
    "the equation ( [ eq : gen ] ) can thus be represented by a set of 10 points in @xmath132 .",
    "call this set of points @xmath133 .",
    "these points lie in a hyperplane in @xmath132 and in a 4-dimensional polytope whose corners are defined by the monomials with coefficients @xmath134 . call this polytope @xmath135 .",
    "we can define a lattice @xmath0 within this @xmath132 such that @xmath136 .    for each face , @xmath137 , of this polytope ( of any codimension , including codimension zero ) we can define another equation given by the points in that face .",
    "for example , one of the codimension 1 faces corresponds to @xmath138 this defines another newton polytope and we can define the regular discriminant related to it . for the face @xmath137 given by ( [ eq : egg ] ) , we would define this regular discriminant @xmath139 in terms of the condition that all @xmath140 for some @xmath141 all nonzero where the index @xmath142 runs over the set @xmath143 .",
    "this is similar to the part of the discriminant we missed with the regular discriminant when @xmath144 .",
    "we have to be careful about the fact that the full discriminant required the condition that @xmath145 whereas this was not required for @xmath139 .",
    "actually this does nt matter . setting @xmath144",
    ", we have @xmath146 but we also have @xmath147 thus , in the definition of @xmath139 , where the vanishing of ( [ eq : ds2 ] ) is imposed we obtain @xmath148 but this forces ( [ eq : ds1 ] ) to vanish .",
    "thus @xmath139 does represent the discriminant of @xmath75 when @xmath144 and @xmath149 .",
    "we can now define the _ principal discriminant _ as @xmath150 where @xmath137 ranges over all faces of @xmath135 from @xmath135 itself to just the vertices of @xmath135 .",
    "we wish to declare that the condition @xmath151 is precisely the condition that the associated quantum field theories are bad . from the reasoning given for the example",
    "when @xmath137 is given by ( [ eq : egg ] ) this is true for all points in @xmath116 .",
    "when we compactify @xmath116 to form @xmath118 , parts of the principal discriminant locus @xmath151 will coincide with parts of the divisor added to compactify @xmath116 .",
    "whether such conformal field theories are bad would appear to rest on precise definitions of `` badness '' .",
    "we will elucidate this point by examples below .",
    "the methods of @xcite can now be used to give information about @xmath152 .",
    "actually we will not be able to construct all of @xmath152 but we will be able to calculate the key parts . for what we mean by `` key parts '' we will now turn to a description of the asymptotic behavior of the discriminant .",
    "the principal discriminant @xmath152 is a complicated polynomial in the variables @xmath112 . as we wonder around the compactified moduli space @xmath118 we encounter regions where there is one particular monomial @xmath153 within the polynomial @xmath152 whose modulus is much bigger than the modulus of any other monomial .",
    "we can map out the general form of such regions as follows .",
    "we will begin by just considering the subspace @xmath154 .",
    "choose an explicit isomorphism @xmath155 , and let @xmath156 be the coordinate from the @xmath157th factor in @xmath110 .",
    "( the coefficients @xmath112 in ( [ eq : gen ] ) can then be expressed in terms of the @xmath158 , @xmath159 . )",
    "we make a change of moduli space parameters by @xmath160 let us also introduce a space @xmath161 with coordinates @xmath162 given by the _ imaginary _ part of @xmath163 , i.e. , @xmath164 .",
    "( later we will put @xmath165 in some sense so we expect @xmath166 to be the space of ( real ) khler forms when interpreted in the mirror setting on @xmath4 . )",
    "suppose now we consider a generic ray in @xmath166 that begins at the origin , @xmath167 , and moves out to infinity .",
    "it is simple to see that if one is sufficiently far out along such a ray then a single term in the discriminant polynomial @xmath152 will dominate it .",
    "this is because the modulus of all the @xmath112 parameters will be very large or very small , and since each monomial in @xmath152 appears with differing exponents of @xmath112 s and the ray is in a generic direction , one monomial will contain the right exponents to win out over the other monomials .",
    "thus if we consider a very large @xmath168 in @xmath166 with its center at @xmath167 , then to almost every point on this sphere we can associate a particular monomial @xmath153 in @xmath152 which will dominate .",
    "asymptotically as the radius of the sphere approaches infinity we can cover @xmath168 with regions , each of which is associated to some monomial @xmath153 .",
    "points along the boundaries of these regions , i.e. , where the regions touch will thus correspond to theories where two or more of the dominating terms in @xmath152 are ( asymptotically ) equal in modulus .",
    "the set @xmath169 of all the monomials which have some region on the limiting @xmath168 associated to them will not , in general , include all the terms in @xmath152",
    ". there will be some terms which never dominate @xmath152 by themselves anywhere on the @xmath168 .",
    "to each element @xmath153 of our set of monomials we may take the region in the @xmath168 at infinity described above and join all such points to @xmath167 by rays .",
    "this associates a cone in @xmath166 to @xmath153 .",

    "the term _ big _ cones will be used to denote the cones associated to the regions , as opposed to the lower - dimensional cones arising from the boundaries between regions . by means of the projection map",
    "@xmath170 , this fan naturally breaks the compactified moduli space @xmath118 itself up into different regions .    we want to understand the transitions between regions of @xmath118 , and how they are related to the zeros of @xmath152 ( i.e. , to the discriminant locus ) .",

    "it is only when one approaches the boundary of a region that there is a possibility of a zero in @xmath152 .",
    "actually we will argue that the image of the discriminant locus in @xmath166 provides codimension one walls which asymptotically follow the walls of the big cones as one moves out away from @xmath167 .",
    "consider a point well away from @xmath167 in a codimension - one wall in @xmath166 separating two big cones associated to @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
    "let us assume that this point is nowhere near any other big cones . in this case",
    "one might at first suspect that @xmath152 will be dominated by @xmath179 . in most cases however some other terms from @xmath172",
    "will also become important .",
    "now consider the line in @xmath166 going through this point in a direction normal to this wall .",

    "consider the complexification of this line to an algebraic curve in @xmath118 specified by these values of the real part of @xmath163 .",
    "that is , the points on this curve map to the line in @xmath166 and correspond to various values of the real part of @xmath163 in the same direction .",
    "there will be at least one solution to @xmath151 along this line . as we vary the other components of the real part of @xmath163 we can move this solution to map out a region of this line .",
    "we know however that this image of the discriminant can not fill up the whole of @xmath166 and is actually squeezed into a real codimension one space as one approaches the @xmath168 at infinity . in some cases ,",
    "as we will see later , this zero in the discriminant occurs precisely on the wall between big cones but in the general case the image of the discriminant locus asymptotically approaches a hyperplane parallel to the wall in question . in figure",
    "[ fig : as ] we show what might happen in an example where @xmath166 is 2-dimensional .",
    "note the fact that the discriminant locus carves up @xmath166 asymptotically into regions given by the cones of the secondary fan except for a shifting given by the exact form of @xmath152 near this wall . later on we will describe these one complex dimensional subspaces of @xmath118 for lines in @xmath166 infinitely far away from @xmath167 and we will calculate where the discriminant locus intersects these subspaces .",
    "we have now arrived at the `` phase '' structure of the moduli space described in @xcite .",
    "each big cone in the secondary fan corresponds to a region of moduli space under the projection @xmath170 .",
    "as we move from one region to another there is a singularity that one may encounter given by the discriminant locus .",

    "this , as we will now describe , adds in points in the moduli space associated with points at infinity in @xmath166 .",
    "first we need to give a lattice structure to @xmath166 , i.e. , to specify a module @xmath180 within the vector space @xmath132 .",
    "we use our coordinates @xmath162 specify this structure , leading to the lattice points being those with integer coefficients @xmath181 for @xmath182 .",
    "consider now each one - dimensional ray @xmath183 in our fan in @xmath166 and associate to it the lattice point it passes through which is closest to @xmath167 .",
    "call this point @xmath184 . in our example",
    "each big cone in the secondary fan is a so - called simplicial cone which simply means that it is subtended by 5 rays @xmath185 . for each big cone",
    "let us introduce a set of coordinates @xmath186 related to the coordinates @xmath187 of @xmath110 by @xmath188 if the @xmath189 s are all nonzero , they can be taken as coordinates in another @xmath110 , and ( [ eq : ccs ] ) defines a map @xmath190 which is finite - to - one .",
    "( it will be one - to - one if the determinant of the matrix @xmath191 is @xmath192 . )",
    "we add to @xmath116 the points given by the vanishing of any number of the @xmath189 s , i.e. , we extend the @xmath110 space given by the @xmath189 coordinates to @xmath193 .",
    "thus each big cone provides a partial compactification of @xmath116 . for each big cone , the points added locally form the structure of coordinate hyperplanes , i.e. , 5 hyperplanes intersecting transversely at a point .",
    "this point of intersection will be considered the `` point at infinity '' or `` limit point '' associated to the big cone .",
    "when we apply the above process for all of the cones in our fan we form a complete compactification of @xmath116 and this completely specifies our compactified moduli space @xmath118 .",
    "the points added form a divisor with normal crossings , i.e. , a codimension - one subspace in @xmath118 whose irreducible components intersect transversely .",
    "it should be noted that the compactified moduli space @xmath118 formed this way will not , in general , be smooth and is not smooth in our example . while one might wish to resolve the singularities in this space to address questions about monodromy of periods @xcite , in this paper it will be important to retain the singularities .",
    "it would appear therefore , that at least in some ways , @xmath118 , and not its resolution , forms the most natural compactification of the moduli space of khler forms on @xmath4 .",
    "there is a relationship between the codimension of parts of the compactification set and the dimension of the cones in our fan .",
    "to each cone of real dimension @xmath194 in our fan , we can associate an irreducible ( sub)space of the compactification divisor of @xmath118 of complex codimension @xmath194 .",
    "for example , each big cone describes a point  the `` point at infinity '' above which is the point @xmath195 in the coordinates @xmath189 .",
    "each one - dimensional ray in the fan corresponds to an irreducible component of the compactification divisor .",
    "of particular interest in this paper will be the codimension one walls in the fan which give one complex dimensional subspaces within the compactification divisor .",
    "the fact that these one dimensional subspaces are compact and toric means that they are _ rational curves _",
    "( isomorphic to @xmath23 ) in @xmath118 .",
    "now we will describe how to calculate @xmath196 for each big cone in @xmath166 following @xcite .",
    "firstly we need to associate a triangulation of the set of points @xmath133 to each big cone .",
    "this was described in detail in @xcite and we will again review it briefly here .",
    "the triangulation will be determined by the choice of a `` height function '' @xmath197 , which to each point @xmath198 , associates a `` height '' @xmath199 . as the name suggests one should think of this as providing the extra coordinate for an embedding @xmath200 .",
    "the space @xmath166 can then be considered to be the space of `` relative heights '' .",
    "that is , fix the position of @xmath135 within this @xmath201 space by , say , fixing the heights of the vertices of @xmath135 be have height zero and then let the other points vary to fill out a space of relative heights @xmath202 .    now consider stretching a piece of rubber over these points which are at various heights .",
    "if the heights are generic , the shape thus formed specifies a triangulation of @xmath133 .",
    "the flat faces of the shape will be simplicial specifying the simplices in the triangulation .",
    "points not touching the shape , i.e. , below the stretched film are not considered in the triangulation .",
    "thus , for example if @xmath203 is negative for all points not vertices of @xmath135 and zero for the vertices of @xmath135 , then the triangulation consists of just the simplex @xmath135 itself . by labeling the points in @xmath166 according to",
    "which triangulation they give , one obtains a fan structure with each big cone specifying a triangulation .",
    "cones of lower dimension specify non - generic heights where one is on the borderline between two or more triangulations .",
    "let us recall that we began by analyzing the principal discriminant and finding that some of the monomials contained in this naturally dominated in some region of moduli space . to each such monomial",
    "we associated a big cone in a fan in the space @xmath166 .",
    "now we have associated a triangulation of the point set @xmath133 to each such cone .",
    "now we can state the algorithm from @xcite which directly specifies the monomial from the triangulation :    each big simplex ( i.e. , simplex of maximal dimension ) , @xmath1 , in the triangulation of @xmath133 can be given a normalized volume , @xmath204 , proportional to its actual volume .",
    "( the constant of proportionality is fixed so that in a maximal , or `` complete , '' triangulation , all simplices are have @xmath205 . ) using the notation of ( [ eq : drd ] ) @xmath206 where @xmath207 is the triangulation associated the this monomial .",
    "the summation in the equation for @xmath153 is taken over the set of @xmath208 such that @xmath209 is a vertex of @xmath1 .",
    "the relative signs of @xmath210 can also be determined by a process given in @xcite .",
    "these signs will play an important rle in our analysis and we will give an equivalent method of their calculation later in this paper .",
    "in our example , the polytope @xmath135 has normalized volume 18 and there are 100 triangulations leading to convex height functions @xmath203 .",
    "( actually these give all possible triangulations of the point set @xmath133 in this case . )",
    "thus , there are 100 monomials in the sum in ( [ eq : drd ] ) and 100 big cones in our fan in @xmath166 . as a simple example , the monomial given by the triangulation consisting of one simplex ( @xmath135 itself ) we have @xmath211 at the other extreme",
    ", there are 5 possible complete triangulations of the set @xmath133 .",
    "one of them has @xmath212 intermediate triangulations give terms such as @xmath213",
    "so far we have built the complete compact space @xmath118 which compactifies the space of complexified khler forms on @xmath4 ( or equivalently , complex structure moduli of @xmath12 ) in the context of conformal field theory .",
    "what we have does not , at first sight , resemble a space of classical khler forms however . in this section",
    "we will review how the structure of @xmath118 is linked to the classical notion of khler forms in some limiting sense and then show how this linkage may be continued to all points in the moduli space . in this way we will extend the usual mathematical notion of volume or size from classical to quantum geometry , as discussed in the introduction .",
    "we will explicitly do this by defining coordinates on the khler moduli space .",
    "in essence , the particular continuation of size from geometry to conformal field theory depends upon how we coordinatize the khler moduli space . in most contexts",
    "we do not place much importance on coordinate choices as we expect all physical conclusions to be independent of the possible choices .",
    "this reasoning is , of course , true here , but there is an important distinction .",
    "the space upon which we are putting coordinates is a moduli space , i.e. a space of coupling constants for a class of conformal field theory actions .",
    "different choices of coordinates correspond to different ways of representing and parametrizing these quantum systems .",
    "our goal in this paper is to _ interpret _ the geometrical content of all of the conformal theories in the enlarged khler moduli space .",
    "this goal , in turn , will dictate particular ways of representing these theories ( via nonlinear sigma models ) and particular parametrizations ( directly in terms of their complexified khler forms and their analytic continuations )  i.e. a particular choice of coordinates on the moduli space .",
    "this , we shall argue , is the choice which makes the geometrical interpretation most clear , but it is certainly not unique .",
    "in fact , we will find it useful to introduce two particular coordinate systems on the enlarged khler moduli space of @xmath4  each of which will give rise to a definition of `` size '' at every point of the moduli space .",
    "for both of these , we will give an implicit definition of length ( inferred from an explicit definition of area ) such that both of the following hold :    1 .",
    "the definition of length in each conformal field theory is given in terms of the fundamental data determining the latter , i.e. its two and three point functions . 2 .",
    "if the underlying conformal theory is smoothly deformed to a large radius  sigma model , then the conformal field theory definition of length asymptotically approaches the standard geometrical definition of length on the  space .",
    "it might be worth pointing out here that such definitions of length should not be expected to be modular invariant .",
    "for instance , specifying that a circle has radius @xmath7 in string theory is not a modular invariant notion because the specified radius obviously differs ( almost everywhere ) from the equivalent radius @xmath8 .",
    "even so , we are certainly justified in saying that string theory on a circle imposes a lower bound of @xmath9 on the radius  the point being that this is true in a fundamental domain ( in the teichmller space ) for the modular group .",
    "thus , in this case , in order to associate a notion of size to conformal field theories , we are obligated to make a choice of fundamental domain and work within it .",
    "as we shall see , toric geometry provides us directly with the moduli space itself rather than the teichmller space .",
    "we will construct a fundamental domain so that the large radius limit will be an element of it of @xmath214 , where @xmath215 is the fundamental domain and @xmath137 is the ``  part '' of the modular group , obtained from integral shifts of the @xmath35 field and the holomorphic automorphisms of @xmath4 @xcite . ] and so we are forming the analog of the @xmath216 region in the above context .    in practice , each of the definitions of length we introduce will rely on mirror symmetry .",
    "namely , we have complete analytic understanding of the complex structure moduli space of , say , @xmath12 .",
    "mirror symmetry provides us with an abstract map from this moduli space to that of the enlarged khler moduli space of @xmath4 .",
    "different explicit realizations of this map will associate different coordinates and hence definitions of length to the underlying conformal theories in the khler moduli space of @xmath4 .",
    "the first explicit realization is mathematically the simplest and amounts to extending the `` monomial - divisor mirror map '' of @xcitethroughout the moduli space .",
    "the same coordinates also naturally arise from the physical approach of @xcite from somewhat the opposite point of view .",
    "the second explicit realization makes use of the results of @xcite which , via the sigma model , provides a direct link between physical observables and classical geometry .      in section [ s : gs ] we obtained the result that the space @xmath118 contained 100 special points which were obtained from the 100 big cones in our fan in @xmath166 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that each of these points could be related to some space that modeled @xmath4 in the following way .",
    "first one takes the cone in @xmath166 associated to the point in @xmath118 .",
    "then one takes the triangulation @xmath207 of @xmath133 associated to this cone .",

    "@xmath4 is then the  manifold defined by @xmath221 at infinite radius limit .",
    "[ i:1 ] 2 .",
    "when @xmath207 is comprised of only the simplex @xmath135 then @xmath218 is a point .",
    "the target space is this point but the quantum field theory includes some massless modes around this point .",
    "this is a landau - ginzburg orbifold theory .",
    "3 .   when @xmath207 omits some points of @xmath133 but @xmath219",

    "4 .   when @xmath207 has more than one simplex , @xmath1 , but @xmath219 is not a vertex of each @xmath1 then one has some kind of hybrid model where at least part of @xmath4 is given by a landau - ginzburg orbifold theory `` fibered '' over a manifold of complex dimension one or two",

    "the divisors representing @xmath223 may also be determined by the monomial - divisor map @xcite .",

    "this is our first definition of coordinates .",
    "we have constructed the complete moduli space @xmath118 of khler forms on @xmath4 and put coordinates on this space that allows us to explicitly assign an area to @xmath14-cycles at every point in @xmath118 .",
    "we may consider that the measurement of areas on @xmath4 is _ defined _ by the choice of cohomology class ( [ eq : mdmm ] ) , and that this definition agrees with classical geometry at large radii .",
    "this definition , as discussed above , can be phrased in terms of the correlation function data of the underlying conformal theory .",
    "therefore , this definition satisfies the two properties emphasized in the beginning of section 4 . _",
    "the measurement of areas defined in this way will be called `` the ' ' . _",
    "this object ( or rather , it s imaginary part ) may be used in the same way as the classical khler class @xmath54 to measure the areas on riemann surfaces in @xmath4 .",
    "( in this case , one can also measure the volume of @xmath4 itself using @xmath233 , and the volumes of divisors on @xmath4 using @xmath234 , but we will concentrate on the area measurements , for reasons we will see shortly . )    the classical geometric significance of these coordinates is most directly gleaned from the work of @xcite .",
    "as we have discussed earlier and will explain more fully in @xcite , witten s approach is the physical manifestation of the toric methods under discussion via the relationship between holomorphic and symplectic quotients .",
    "the real part of the coordinates @xmath76 ( more generally , @xmath235 ) which appear in the action ( [ eq : lg ] ) are , in fact , precisely the algebraic coordinates just defined . that is ,",
    "if one wants to connect the  to some classical notion of distance then the  may be thought of as arising from the classical khler form on the target space of the non - conformal field theory given by ( [ eq : lg ] ) .    with this definition of the complexified khler class @xmath56 ,",
    "the image of the  phase under the projection @xmath170 is precisely the khler cone of @xmath4 .",
    "if one follows a path in @xmath118 which moves from the large radius  on @xmath4 to a point @xmath236 where @xmath237 lies outside that cone , then @xmath238 becomes negative for some @xmath157 just as one passes through the wall of the cone .",
    "that is , the area of some riemann surface on @xmath4 becomes negative at this point .",
    "thus , the 99 other cones in @xmath166 can be interpreted as a  on @xmath4 where some area is negative . as mentioned in the introduction , in the first case studied in @xcite of the mirror of the quintic threefold , @xmath166 was a line and consisted of just two cones , i.e. , two rays in either direction from @xmath167 .",
    "when one ray is interpreted as the khler cone of the  manifold one sees that the other region must be interpreted as a manifold whose overall volume is negative and that the landau - ginzburg orbifold theory can be thought of as a  manifold with overall volume equal to @xmath239 .",
    "our situation is similar but now we have 99 limit points where the area of some subspace of @xmath4 ( and perhaps the volume of @xmath4 itself ) is @xmath239 .",
    "four of these other regions actually have all of the associated areas being positive if we interpret the situation not in terms of @xmath4 but rather in terms of a topologically different manifold  a _ flop _ of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that we have not modified the physics in any way ; we have only reinterpreted the conformal field theory in terms of its most natural geometrical model .",
    "some of the other 95 limit points correspond to orbifolds . in this context , the orbifold points in the moduli space of  manifolds would normally be thought of as limit points where some divisor , the _ exceptional divisor _ , has shrunk down to zero volume ( the reverse of blowing up ) .",
    "when we use the  however we arrive at the different conclusion that the volume of the exceptional divisor is @xmath239 at the orbifold point .",
    "( in terms of areas : every riemann surface within that exceptional divisor has area @xmath239 . ) actually this shift from 0 to @xmath239 is a recurring feature of many of the other regions . in each case",
    "one would naturally have wanted to interpret the conformal field theory as having some target space in which some part of @xmath4 has shrunk to zero area , but in each case the area defined by the  is @xmath239 .",
    "the landau - ginzburg orbifold model is the extreme case  here the target space is a point , i.e. , the whole of @xmath4 has shrunk to zero , whereas its algebraic areas are all @xmath239 .",
    "thus we have seen that the  has its advantages and disadvantages .",
    "it is easily defined in terms of the natural coordinate charts on @xmath118 and it reproduces the khler cone of @xmath4 . what one might be uncomfortable with however is the fact that most of the moduli space @xmath118 is comprised of @xmath4 s with negative area subspaces and that this definition has a complicated ( and largely only implicit ) conformal field theory representation .",
    "we will now make another attempt at defining `` size , '' this time trying to model more closely the properties of the classical khler form .",
    "this is done at the expense of the simplicity of the definition in terms of the natural coordinates on @xmath118 .",
    "one can use the action ( [ eq : sm2 ] ) to calculate the 3-point function between ( chiral , antichiral)-fields in the resulting quantum field theory .",
    "this is best achieved by twisting this @xmath0=(2,2 ) superconformal  into the so - called _ a - model _ topological field theory @xcite .",
    "each field can be associated to an element of @xmath240 and the 3-point functions can in principle be calculated from intersection theory .",
    "if to each field @xmath241 we associate a divisor @xmath242 , then to leading order in the large radius limit we have @xmath243 ( we omit the `` # '' symbol denoting `` degree of intersection '' from now on . )",
    "these intersection numbers agree with those predicted by the monomial - divisor mirror map @xcite as explained above . beyond this asymptotic form of the 3-point functions at large radius limit",
    "we may ask what happens if @xmath4 is near , rather than at , the large radius limit . in this case",
    "one may expand the 3-point function out in terms of an instanton series @xcite .",
    "the instantons in question are given by holomorphically embedded @xmath23 s in @xmath4 and for the exact form of this instanton series one should consult @xcite ( and the references therein ) but it can be stated roughly as @xmath244 where @xmath137 is a holomorphically embedded @xmath23 in @xmath4 and @xmath245 is a monomial in the @xmath246 s .",
    "we define the parameters @xmath246 by @xmath247 with @xmath35 and @xmath54 coming from ( [ eq : sm2 ] ) so that the resulting 3-point functions appear as power series in the @xmath246 s .",
    "this leads us to another way of defining areas for a point in @xmath118 .",
    "that is , we determine the values of @xmath248 required to give the correct 3-point functions when these 3-point functions are expressed as an instanton sum , i.e. , as a power series in @xmath246 .",

    "_ we will refer to this definition of area - measurement as `` the ' ' .",
    "_ note that to perform the analytical continuation of the over @xmath118 we need to make some branch cuts in @xmath118 .",
    "we claim that there is a natural choice and we specify this choice later .",
    "the reason that we distinguish these two definitions of area - measurement in this paper is because they are , in fact , different .",
    "that is , in general , @xmath249 so we will need to specify which coordinates we are using , in order to specify the measures . from now on we will use the symbol @xmath56 to refer to the _ _ only .",
    "returning to witten s approach to the  outlined in the previous section we see that when one takes the renormalization group flow limit of the field theory given by ( [ eq : lg ] ) to the conformal field theory the  must `` flow '' to the .",
    "after all , ( [ eq : lg ] ) is describing a sigma - model .",
    "these definitions of the  and the  are , as constructed , in complete agreement at the large radius limit .",
    "thus , with our conventions about @xmath56 being the , we can modify ( [ eq : mdmm ] ) to read @xmath250 i.e. , we expand @xmath251 as a power series for small @xmath189 .",
    "actually we have not justified the omission of a constant term in the right - hand - side of ( [ eq : mm ] ) and we will return to this point briefly later .    in @xcite a good geometrical way of picturing these natural  coordinates in terms of the mirror theory @xmath12 was introduced .",
    "if we view @xmath118 as the moduli space of complex structures of @xmath12 then a natural set of coordinates can be introduced via the _ gau - manin connection_. that is , in the case of 3-folds we introduce the holomorphic 3-form @xmath252 and a set of 3-cycles @xmath253 .",
    "one can then define @xmath254 these coordinates are independent of the normalization of @xmath252 and will satisfy ( [ eq : mm ] ) if @xmath255 are suitably chosen .",
    "see @xcite for more information . in @xcite",
    "the definition of the  via ( [ eq : period ] ) was used directly to obtain the correction terms in ( [ eq : mm ] ) .",
    "that is , certain 3-cycles were found and @xmath252 was integrated over them . in practice this method will be unsuited to approach the problems addressed in this paper .",
    "instead it was noticed in @xcite that these periods satisfied a differential equation and in @xcite that one could use these differential equations to find the form of ( [ eq : mm ] ) without explicitly constructing the 3-cycles @xmath255 .",
    "there is an important qualitative feature of the local solutions to these differential equations .",
    "the cycle @xmath256 has the property that @xmath257 is regular as a function of the @xmath189 .",
    "thus , comparing ( [ eq : mm ] ) with ( [ eq : period ] ) , we find @xmath258 which tells us that in addition to the regular solution , there is a solution with a @xmath259 type growth for each @xmath159 .",
    "moreover , all the other solutions will involve products or powers of these log terms .",
    "all of this is discussed in more detail in @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile noting that whereas we had no problem in in using the  to measure areas and volumes of @xmath4 and its subspaces in the classical way , the same is not true for the .",
    "for example defining @xmath260 one would find the value of the volume behaved in an unsatisfactory way as one moved around the moduli space .",
    "a better definition would be some object of the form of a correlation function @xmath261 . some of the properties of the  are actually quite insidious . in the classical picture",
    "the khler form lives in the linear vector space @xmath18 .",
    "although we tried to mimic this in the quantum picture by exercising great care in choosing the coordinates , the quantum corrected moduli space is not flat and this is reflected in some non - linearity in the structure of the .",
    "this underlies the reason why the ring structure given by the wedge product in @xmath262 is not a natural object in @xmath118 .",
    "we will refer to this issue of non - linearity briefly again later in the paper and we hope to address further questions about this structure in future work . in this paper",
    "we will only attempt to use the  to directly measure the area of riemann surfaces in @xmath4 .",
    "we will also use the classical notion that if a manifold has zero volume then any subspace within it is also of zero volume .",
    "this is the only sense in which we will measure volumes , as opposed to areas of riemann surfaces .",
    "in this section we will discuss the system of partial differential equations which allow one to find the natural  coordinates ( [ eq : period ] ) required for the . with the notation of section [ s : gs ] , let @xmath198 have coordinates @xmath263 in @xmath132 . for given values of @xmath264",

    "we first need to make a special choice of coordinates on the @xmath132 space in which the points @xmath133 live .",

    "we may remove the @xmath279 condition by multiplying @xmath282 by the necessary powers of @xmath283 required to achieve @xmath110 invariance , thus we have @xmath284 ( fractional powers appear here because the landau - ginzburg orbifold point is at a quotient singularity in @xmath118 . )",
    "actually there is a technical point that should be addressed here .",
    "the above form for the landau - ginzburg orbifold coordinates reflects the fact that there is a @xmath91-quotient singularity at this point in the moduli space .",
    "quotient singularities in one complex dimension are trivial is the sense that they can be removed by a change of coordinates .",
    "our description of @xmath118 in terms of toric geometry automatically removes such singularities .",
    "the @xmath91-quotient singularity in the moduli space is actually only a @xmath285-quotient singularity once this process is performed .",
    "thus in the toric description given one should actually use a 3-fold cover of the above coordinates .",
    "an alternative is to modify the definition of the coordinates @xmath184 in terms of the rays of the secondary fan .",

    "in fact , each such rational curve contains precisely two of our 100 limit points  the two points given by the big cones which this wall separates . in our example , each big cone in @xmath166 has 5 codimension one faces , that is , given one of the 100 limit points , there are 5 rational curves in @xmath118 passing through this point each of which passes through another limit point . in this way , there are 250 rational curves which form a `` web '' in @xmath118 connecting all of the 100 limit points .",

    "the hypergeometric ordinary differential equations in question on @xmath23 has solutions with possible singularities or branch points at three points which we will call @xmath324 .",
    "the points 0 and @xmath10 are the two limit points which the rational curve connects in @xmath118 .",
    "@xmath325 is the only other singular point and is thus where the discriminant locus of section [ ss : cp ] cuts this curve . to be more precise",
    "it is usually the case that the whole rational curve is contained in the discriminant locus . in this case",

    "( any other choice would be artificially unsymmetric . )",
    "we extend these cuts from the rational curves on the boundary into the interior of the moduli space , to form a fundamental domain .",
    "this choice of fundamental domain is implicit in all that follows in this paper .    in order to put the singularities at @xmath325",
    "we will need to rescale the @xmath189 s introduced earlier .",
    "the sign of this rescaling is the source of the @xmath328 factors in the monomial - divisor mirror map .",
    "we may think of this sign as arising from attempting to fix the mirror map so that the number of lines on a  manifold is positive .",
    "as mentioned earlier , a three - point function in our conformal field theory may be expanded as an instanton sum in @xmath246 where the coefficients in this series give information regarding the numbers of holomorphically embedded @xmath23 s on @xmath4 .",
    "in particular the sub - leading term is expected to be the number of lines ( that is , the number of holomorphically embedded @xmath23 s in @xmath4 the homology class of whose image is some fixed integral generator of @xmath329 ) . to be more precise , in some cases",
    "one may have families of lines depending on parameters , and then the `` number of lines '' must be interpreted by means of the top chern class of the parameter space of the family @xcite .",
    "it is generally believed @xcite that in such a case a deformation of complex structure to a generic almost complex structure will yield a discrete set of lines .",
    "however , some of these lines may count negatively and thus we can not use this strategy to fix the sign of @xmath309 in the monomial - divisor mirror map in all cases . instead , we first note that if there were a three - point function whose expansion in @xmath246 had all coefficients positive , then any pole at the edge of convergence of such a series would occur when @xmath246 is real and positive .",
    "since @xmath330 to leading order , we find the sign required in such a case once we know how to rescale @xmath189 to give a pole at @xmath325 .",
    "this is the sign choice @xmath328 that we specified earlier . by looking at perestroka such that one limit point corresponds to a large radius limit smooth manifold",
    ", one can show that this sign choice is consistent with the signs in the principal discriminant given by @xcite .",
    "unfortunately for a general three - point function , not all of the coefficients in the @xmath246-expansion need be positive . to maintain consistency with @xcite we thus _ conjecture _ that the sign given by @xmath328 is always the correct choice even when negative coefficients in the expansion occur .",
    "that is , we assume that the pole in the @xmath246-expansion of any 3-point function occurs for a real and positive @xmath246 ( i.e. , @xmath331 ) . if our conjecture is wrong and we were to pick the wrong sign for @xmath189 then we would be counting the number of lines on @xmath4 with the wrong sign .    in summary",
    "we thus do the following . given the definition of @xmath189 in ( [ eq : z2a ] ) we find the constant by which we need to rescale @xmath332 to put a pole at @xmath325 .",
    "the sign of this factor is @xmath328 .",
    "this sign is absorbed in the monomial - divisor mirror map so that we only take the absolute value of this scale factor in our definition of @xmath309 .",
    "now we will apply this construction to several examples .",
    "it is important to note that although we are describing the following examples from the perspective of our five - parameter example , in each case we only actually study the part of the toric fan specific to the transformation we look at . thus the following results are clearly valid for any  moduli space that is studied this way . in fact , in string theory , we expect results concerning flops , blowing - up orbifolds etc . , to be dependent only on the local geometry of @xmath4 .",
    "this means that the following examples should _ not _ be considered dependent on the global structure of @xmath4 .",
    "recall that a flop is the transformation of a manifold into a ( possibly ) topologically different manifold which replaces a @xmath23 with another @xmath23 .",
    "this occurs by blowing down a @xmath23 in the original manifold to form a singular space with a _",
    "double point_. this double point can then be resolved by blowing up to give a @xmath23 in two different ways .",
    "one way returns the original manifold and the other way yields another manifold . in general a flop",
    "need not take a khler manifold to another khler manifold . in this paper",
    "however we are moving from one manifold to another directly by a change of khler form and so in this context we are guaranteed a khler flop .",
    "any manifold which was a non - khler flop of @xmath4 would not have a big cone in the secondary fan .",
    "the following perestroka is a _",
    "flop_. @xmath333 this was precisely the perestroka considered in section [ ss : rc ] .",
    "that is , we may specify it by the linear relation ( using the numbering conventions of our example ) @xmath334 the ode associated the the flop , as we saw ( in this case no rescaling of the @xmath309 parameter is required ) , is @xmath335 this has a general global solution @xmath336 which is also a general local solution for each @xmath337 .",
    "we can now follow @xcite in finding the  in terms of @xmath309 .",
    "the component of the  we find is , of course , the part that varies as we move along the rational curve in @xmath118 . to find this khler form ,",
    "we take the solution for @xmath338 that behaves to leading order like @xmath339 at @xmath326 and divide it by the solution which is @xmath340 to leading order at @xmath326 .",
    "that is , we find @xmath56 as the ratio of two solutions such that equation ( [ eq : mm ] ) is obeyed . in this case",
    "this is a trivial task since we have solutions which are exactly a constant and exactly @xmath339 .",
    "therefore @xmath341 that is , the  is the * same * as the . to be more precise",
    "_ when one performs a flop of one  manifold into another and holds all the other components of the khler form at large radius limit then the  coincides with the _ .",
    "in particular , this implies that the area of the flopped @xmath23 does attain the value zero in the  definition , just as it does in the algebraic definition . in this setting , therefore , string theory does not supply us with a nonzero lower bound .",
    "of course , the size of the whole manifold is being kept infinite ( i.e. , any riemann surface in a class other than the one being flopped has infinite area ) and it is only a part of the space which shrinks to zero .",
    "the flop is a bit too trivial to show the full singularity structure in the differential equation .",
    "one will find however that many three - point functions will have a pole at @xmath342 .",
    "the fact that the  and the  coincide in the region of @xmath118 considered in this section has some interesting consequences for the 3-point functions of the superconformal field theory ( which we developed in discussions with witten @xcite ) .",
    "it is known @xcite that in classical geometry , the khler cones of two manifolds related by a flop fit together in @xmath343 by touching each other along the wall of each khler cone ( where the area of the flopped @xmath23 becomes zero ) .",
    "this is equivalent to saying that , so far as khler form data is concerned , the class represented by the flopped @xmath23 has negative area in the flopped manifold . since the  generates the same cone structure as the classical khler form , the same considerations must also work for the  and thus also for the .",
    "it is important to bear in mind that the homology class of the @xmath23 present after the flop is the _ negative _ of the homology class present before the flop .",
    "thus , although the class of the original @xmath23 acquires a negative area as the wall between cones is traversed , the post - flop @xmath23 will have a positive area in the new region ( since it belongs to the opposite class ) .    in the portion of @xmath118 we consider ,",
    "all riemann surfaces in @xmath4 , except for the ones being flopped , are of infinite area .",
    "call the finite set of @xmath23 s being flopped @xmath344 .",
    "( these are all in the same homology class . )",
    "a 3-point function is then given by @xmath345 where @xmath346 and @xmath347 is a divisor representing the field @xmath348 in the usual way .",
    "let us consider the  manifold @xmath21 at large radius limit . in this limit @xmath349 and so the sum in ( [ eq : iflp ] ) vanishes .",

    "this time however the solution that behaves like @xmath339 can not be determined in terms of elementary functions .    to find the required solution of ( [ eq : z3h ] ) we need to turn to the theory of hypergeometric functions . indeed , with the exception of the flop and the @xmath375-orbifold , all the ode s we obtain for a perestroka will require hypergeometric function theory to find the .",
    "recall @xcite that the hypergeometric function @xmath416 is defined by the infinite series @xmath417 where @xmath418 are complex numbers ( not to be confused with any previous use of these symbols ) .",

    "hence we recover the solution we already knew .    to find the other solution we require , we substitute @xmath423 into ( [ eq : z3h ] ) .",
    "this leads to a lower - order hypergeometric differential equation with solution @xmath424 . expanding this solution we obtain @xmath425 for some constant , @xmath13 .",
    "this clearly provides the other solution we require so that @xmath426    now let us determine , as we did for the @xmath375 quotient singularity , the areas of the riemann surfaces within the exceptional divisor when @xmath384 . in the case of the @xmath375 orbifold",
    "we have an exact form for the and so this determination was straight - forward . in the @xmath410 case",
    "however we only have a series solution and this clearly diverges as @xmath384 .",
    "what we require therefore is the analytic continuation of the series in ( [ eq : z3s ] ) .",
    "this may be done by solving the hypergeometric differential equation , this time as a series expanded around @xmath327 and then match these solutions to the solutions around @xmath326 .",
    "this is known as the _ connection problem _ ( see for example @xcite ) . in @xcite",

    "we need to multiply ( [ eq : f12c ] ) by @xmath439 and integrate . doing this",

    "the subtlety arises because of the double pole we now have at @xmath430 .",
    "remember that if @xmath441 is nonzero and finite at @xmath430 then the residue of @xmath442 at @xmath430 is @xmath443 .",

    "putting @xmath389 to obtain the orbifold point we see that @xmath451 .",
    "thus the size of the exceptional divisor is again zero and again the @xmath35-field has value @xmath452 . notice the cancellation that was required between the digamma functions appearing from the double pole in the barnes - type integral and the @xmath453-type factors that were required to achieve this seemingly trivial final result .",
    "note from ( [ eq : hpsi ] ) that , for @xmath454 we have @xmath455 .",
    "this shows that @xmath393 , i.e. , we have only non - negative areas in this region .",
    "in fact , negative areas are completely excluded from the conformal field theories parameterized by this rational curve in @xmath118 .",

    "one finds @xmath456 and @xmath457 ( @xmath458 putting back units of length ) .",
    "thus , in contrast to the @xmath375-singularity case , the discriminant now vanishes when we acquire a specific non - zero size for the exceptional divisor .",
    "naturally everything we said about the description of a theory in terms of twisted marginal operators in the last section also applies to this case .",
    "in our example the twisted marginal operator resolving the @xmath410-quotient singularity would be @xmath459 .",
    "again this is only locally of the form of a quotient singularity and this operator is not twisted under any global symmetry of a covering theory .",
    "the moduli space of khler forms on the so - called @xmath460-manifold was studied in @xcite .",
    "this manifold is the resolution of an orbifold with @xmath410-quotient singularities of the form studied in this section .",
    "indeed similar hypergeometric functions appear in @xcite where the entire region of moduli space in the orbifold `` phase '' is studied .",
    "in this paper we will concentrate mainly on perestroka which take one from a large radius limit smooth  manifold to a neighbouring cone .",
    "this is because we know how to define the khler form for the smooth  manifold by using the monomial - divisor mirror map .",
    "if we look at any other perestroka it would be necessary to first determine @xmath56 at one of the limit points by following a path from a smooth manifold limit point .",
    "as we discuss briefly later , such a path will usually raise considerations about basis changes as one moves from one perestroka to the next . in this section",
    "we look at a simple example where we may ignore such problems .",
    "that is , we will blow down two irreducible divisors which will not `` interfere '' with each other and thus no basis change is required .    any quotient singularity in  spaces of complex dimension 3 other than the two we have just studied will require an exceptional divisor with more than one irreducible component .",
    "this means that a complete resolution of the singularity requires more than one perestroka .",

    "the top - left diagram is the complete blow - up of this singularity to give a smooth space .",
    "there are two irreducible components to the exceptional divisor and thus two perestroka are involved .",
    "the two components of the exceptional divisor may be produced in either order in the blow - up procedure so that there are two possible paths the perform the blow - up as shown above .",
    "such a choice of paths is a common feature in @xmath118 .",
    "it is clear from figure [ fig : web ] that the journey between any two limit points may be taken along many paths . in order for us to be able to give a value of the  to each limit point we require that the choice of paths does not affect this value .",
    "one of the paths in this @xmath463 example ( taken along line 2 and 1 in ( [ eq : z4 t ] ) ) consists of two perestroka of the type considered in section [ ss : z2 ] .",
    "we know therefore that this path leads to zero volumes for both components of the exceptional divisor in the orbifold limit . in the alternative path ,",
    "line 4 is also of this type so that one component of the exceptional divisor is again zero at the orbifold point . in order for ( [ eq : z4 t ] ) to be commutative",
    "we thus require that the perestroka given by line 3 gives zero volume at this point as we will now check .    in our example",
    "this configuration is given by @xmath465 leading to @xmath466 we can now follow the procedure in section [ ss : z3 ] where now we are dealing with the solutions of the equation related to the hypergeometric function @xmath467 . again the regular solution is a constant and again we obtain the other solution by the trick in equation ( [ eq : bl1 ] ) .",
    "this time we obtain @xmath468 where @xmath469 and @xmath470 .",
    "thus at the orbifold point , as @xmath471 we have zero volume again as we expected .",
    "thus far we have always obtained the the result that @xmath451 at the limit point where we remove a point from @xmath133 from the triangulation .",
    "this is _ not _ a general feature .",
    "it is not difficult to convince oneself however that it will be when can use the constructions above .",
    "that is , the digamma functions introduced by the double pole at @xmath326 will cancel the factor introduced in the definition of @xmath309 .",
    "this construction of the  relied on the fact that one of the solutions of the hypergeometric differential equation was a constant .",
    "remember from ( [ eq : phf ] ) that @xmath122 plays a distinguished rle in our hypergeometric system .",
    "so far , non of the perestroka considered have involved the point @xmath219 .",
    "so long as this is true , we will obtain a hypergeometric equation with a constant solution .",
    "in fact , it is not hard to prove that the condition for _ not _ having a constant solution is as follows .",
    "when the linear relation ( [ eq : linrel ] ) is formed , @xmath472 must be non - zero and have opposite sign to the other non - zero @xmath319 s .",
    "this statement is equivalent to the statement that the associated perestroka consists of removing ( or adding ) @xmath219 to the triangulation .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the point @xmath219 plays a distinguished rle for another reason .",
    "if @xmath219 is a vertex of every simplex in the triangulation of @xmath133 then @xmath4 may be interpreted as an irreducible space of complex dimension 3 .",
    "if @xmath219 is a vertex of only some of the simplices then @xmath4 is reducible with only part of @xmath4 having a 3-dimensional representation .",
    "if @xmath219 does not appear in the triangulation then the dimension of @xmath4 is @xmath473 .",
    "thus , the perestroka we have not yet considered are the ones which lower the dimension of @xmath4 down from 3 .",
    "an extreme example of this is effectively the one studied in @xcite where the other limit point is a landau - ginzburg orbifold theory , i.e. , @xmath4 has dimension 0 .",
    "we shall first study one of the neighbours of `` resolution 5 '' of @xcite where the dimension is shrunk down to 2 ( see @xcite for a full explanation of this ) .",
    "the perestroka is identical to that considered in section [ ss : z3 ] except now the relation is @xmath474 and thus @xmath475 now the differential equation is @xmath476 thus , the solution which is regular at @xmath326 is given by @xmath477 . in ( [ eq : f12c ] )",
    "we gave the analytic continuation of this for @xmath434 .",
    "we now need to find the solution of ( [ eq : z3h0 ] ) that behaves as @xmath339 at @xmath326 and continue this to @xmath434 .",
    "from our earlier analysis of barnes - type integrals we saw that a double pole gave a residue with a @xmath339 term . with this success in mind",
    "consider the following @xmath478 completing the path to the right and taking residues we obtain @xmath479_{t = n}z^n.\\cr}\\ ] ] completing the path to the left and taking residues we obtain @xmath480 where , as in section [ ss : z3 ] , @xmath437 and @xmath481 .",
    "the above expresses @xmath482 as a linear combination of the same functions that appeared in ( [ eq : f12c ] ) and so @xmath483 is a solution of ( [ eq : z3h0 ] ) .",
    "thus we have found the solution that behaves like @xmath339 at @xmath326 and its analytic continuation for @xmath434 . this is a general method for finding the extra solutions of a hypergeometric equation",
    "whose regular solution is @xmath484  simply take some of the @xmath485 factors in the denominator of the barnes - type integral and move them into the numerator as @xmath486 terms ( with a change in sign of @xmath309 for each term ) .",
    "this produces a high - order pole at @xmath326 which gives some power of @xmath339 when the residue is taken .",
    "the monomial - divisor mirror map tells us @xmath487 to find the value of @xmath56 at the limit point corresponding to the 2-dimensional target space , we take @xmath454 whence from ( [ eq : f12c ] ) and ( [ eq : f12nc ] ) we obtain @xmath488 thus for @xmath389 we have @xmath489 and @xmath490 .",
    "that is , the area of the generator of @xmath329 ( and thus we infer the volume of @xmath4 ) at this limit point is _ not _ zero .",
    "we also see from the above expression that for small @xmath197 we have @xmath491 showing how the size always increases as we move away from @xmath389 .",
    "the method of calculation we have just done may also be applied to the mirror of the quintic threefold as studied in @xcite . in this case",
    "we obtain the result that at the landau - ginzburg orbifold point we obtain @xmath492 ( which is equal to @xmath493 as stated in @xcite ) .",
    "we thus see that it is impossible to shrink the whole  manifold down to a point as measured by the .",
    "if we think of a path on figure [ fig : web ] that begins at a smooth  point and ends on the landau - ginzburg orbifold point then one of the lines we traverse must correspond to a perestroka that removes @xmath219 and hence yields @xmath494 . notice that to calculate the value of @xmath56 at , say , the landau - ginzburg orbifold point is quite complicated .",
    "as we follow a path along the web of figure [ fig : web ] , at each vertex we have to change the basis of @xmath56 to prepare for the next perestroka .",
    "because , as mentioned , earlier we do not have a nice linear structure on the moduli space expressed in terms of the coordinates , the basis change will generally involve transcendental functions .    consider the perestroka that adds the point @xmath219 to the minimal triangulation comprising of just the simplex @xmath135 .",
    "this is the transition between the landau - ginzburg orbifold and the  space which is a hypersurface in the unresolved @xmath93 ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "if we measure the volume of the landau - ginzburg orbifold according to this transition by the above calculation we obtain @xmath495 .",
    "this shows that the above value of @xmath490 must change as we blow - down the remaining parts of @xmath4 to obtain the landau - ginzburg orbifold .",
    "this change occurs because of the basis changes in this process .",
    "we began this paper by noting two properties of string theory which are relevant for understanding the space of allowed target space metrics .",
    "first , recent work @xcite  has shown that string theory makes sense even if the target space metric does not satisfy the usual positivity conditions that one classically expects . in this",
    "regard we are led to augment the space of allowed khler forms beyond the usual khler cone .",
    "second , a number of works have demonstrated that string theory appears to impose  minimal lengths \" and hence restricts the physically relevant space of khler forms to lie within the usual khler cone .",
    "part of the purpose of the present work has been to study these divergent tendencies and show that , in fact , they are completely consistent .    in particular , since the concept of  size \" is an intrinsically classical mathematical notion , we have carefully studied ways of extending its meaning to the more abstract realm of conformal field theory . in essence , we have sought to find natural continuations of the definition of size from classical to quantum geometry .",
    "there is no unique way of doing this .",
    "we have found , though , that when our conformal field theory has a sigma model interpretation we can extract a definition of size , by using mirror symmetry , from the geometric structure of the latter .",
    "we can then extend this definition by analytic continuation to all theories in the enlarged khler moduli space .",
    "we have seen , in particular , that this gives rise to a precise meaning , rooted in the structure of conformal sigma models , to the _ area of two - cycles _ throughout the moduli space .    with sufficient calculational power",
    ", we would explicitly carry out this program and thereby study the full realm of possible areas for these cycles .",
    "the work of @xcite , for example , would appear to indicate that zero and negative areas would necessarily arise .",
    "the present paper , though , has shown that the definition of area that one would directly extract from these works ( the ) does not agree with the natural sigma model khler form discussed above .",
    "we have therefore sought to determine if the latter definition restores something akin to the usual positivity conditions . for calculational",
    "ease , we have limited our attention to particular complex dimension one subspaces in the enlarged khler moduli space for the illustrative example studied in @xcite .    in terms of",
    "the  the enlarged moduli space of khler forms naturally leads to many `` khler cones '' , each associated to its own geometric model of @xmath4 , glued together spanning the whole @xmath343 . in our example",
    "there are 100 such cones of which 5 correspond to smooth  manifolds .",
    "we have considered complex dimension one spaces in this moduli space which join the `` large radius limit points '' in each region . in order to determine the value of the  at each of these limit points",
    ", we have considered the network of rational curves in the compactification divisor of the moduli space which connects them .",
    "each such rational curve leads to an ordinary hypergeometric equation allowing for an analysis along the lines of @xcite .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that the extreme values of the  will occur at the these limit points . in this paper",
    "we have demonstrated this only in a limited sense by looking at the neighbourhoods within rational curves of some of the limit points , where we discover that _ not _ all values in @xmath343 are attained by the . to be more precise , all necessarily negative of @xmath4 .",
    "] areas are eliminated as well as small positive sizes where all components of the  are small .",
    "notice however that some riemann surfaces _ can _ be shrunk down to zero area while other parts of @xmath4 are held at large - radius limit .",
    "more precisely , if we plot the `` @xmath54 '' part of the  ( i.e. , the imaginary part of @xmath56 ) in @xmath343 we do not find a cone structure for each of the 100 phase regions . the 5 cones of the smooth  models are retained as cones asymptotically away from the origin since the  and the  coincide there .",
    "all of the other 95 limit points are mapped somewhere within these 5 cones  i.e. , they all have non - negative areas with respect to at least one of these 5 models . thus , assuming these limit points represent extreme values of @xmath54 , the whole moduli space of s maps into this union of 5 cones .",
    "we can represent this idea in figure  [ fig : mush ] .",
    "we show roughly how the space of algebraic @xmath54 s as shown in figure  [ fig : as ] is expected to be modified in going to the same diagram of the  @xmath54 in a hypothetical example where two of the cones give smooth  manifolds .",
    "the two smooth regions are labeled @xmath21 and @xmath22 and the other regions are labeled a , b and c.    [ fig : mush ]    it would appear therefore that no negative areas appear in the space of conformal field theories describing non - linear s or at least if negative areas do occur then they can be redefined away by using a topologically different model for @xmath4 . thus , string theory does require us to enlarge the space of allowed khler forms beyond the usual classical khler cone , but it does so in a manner consistent with non - negative areas .",
    "in this way , we resolve the puzzle discussed at the beginning of this section and in the introduction .",
    "it is interesting to compare the results of this paper with the results of classical general relativity  i.e. , the moduli space of ricci - flat metrics on @xmath4 .",
    "it turns out that that both the flop and the quotient singularity ( and its blow - up ) appear as limiting classical solutions to the einstein equations .",
    "first we describe the flop .",
    "this case was studied in @xcite and we shall repeat here only an outline of the argument . with a @xmath496 matrix representation of the coordinates , @xmath75 , one can define a distance @xmath497 from the double point when the @xmath23 is blown down .",
    "the metric can then be written @xmath498 where @xmath499 is some function of @xmath73 and @xmath62 is the coordinate on the @xmath23 .",
    "the real parameter @xmath500 in the above corresponds to the area of the flopped @xmath23 and thus may be taken as the component of the ( real ) khler form which gives this area . if @xmath501 then the above metric is degenerate ( in the sense that some distinguished points are now separated by zero distance ) . if @xmath502 one may change coordinates to give a smooth metric with a @xmath23 with area @xmath503 @xcite .",
    "thus we see that the only difference between this picture and the stringy picture we presented in terms of @xmath118 is that we have an extra degree of freedom in the @xmath35-field which may be used to smooth out the singularity at @xmath501 as far the conformal field theory is concerned @xcite .",
    "when we turn to the quotient singularity there is a bigger difference .",
    "for example , let us consider the blow - up of the singularity of the type considered in section [ ss : z3 ] . near the @xmath410 singularity , or its blow - up , we have @xcite : @xmath504 where @xmath505 .",
    "this contains a real parameter @xmath506 for a smooth metric ( with suitable change of coordinates ) .",
    "this is roughly the form of the metric irrespective of the global geometry so long as @xmath507 , where @xmath7 is some characteristic length of the global geometry of @xmath4 . as shown in @xcite this geometry",
    "contains a @xmath508 submanifold with the standard fubini - study metric .",
    "the line element , @xmath509 , on this @xmath508 is proportional to the parameter @xmath500 .",
    "this @xmath508 is clearly the exceptional divisor with @xmath501 giving the quotient singularity .",
    "varying this parameter thus corresponds to varying the component of the real khler form that gives the volume of the exceptional divisor . for a smooth metric",
    "we require @xmath506 .",
    "this gives the classical moduli space a boundary .",
    "if we continue into the @xmath502 region then the @xmath508 acquires negative size and part of @xmath4 becomes `` pinched off '' .",
    "this metric is still ricci - flat and so depending on one s qualms about negative areas one might wish to consider this a solution of classical general relativity .",
    "when we look at the orbifold point in @xmath118 we see a different picture . now",
    "the point in @xmath118 which corresponds to a zero volume exceptional divisor is not on a boundary  @xmath118 has no boundary .",
    "as we move in any direction away from this point the volume of the exceptional divisor becomes positive ( or remains zero ) and so we never need to address the question of negative volumes .",
    "we are unable to pinch off regions of space in this manner .",
    "in general the singularities in the conformal field theories appear in a different location in the moduli space compared to the classical picture . in the case of a @xmath375-quotient singularity",
    "the singular theory appears at zero - volume exceptional divisor , i.e. , just where the singular metric occurs but for the @xmath410-quotient singularity we need a small but non - zero exceptional divisor to have a singular theory .",
    "that is , the string theory is singular when the classical theory is smooth !",
    "we should be clear about our language of which regions are and are not included in our moduli space .",
    "the situation is analogous to the string on a circle of radius @xmath7 and the @xmath510 duality .",
    "one point of view is to say that distances @xmath511 exist but may be reinterpreted as distances @xmath512 .",
    "the other point of view is to say that string theory cuts off distances @xmath511 .",
    "we are implicitly assuming this second point of view in the above . this is",
    "because we have _ defined _ the  in terms of the large radius limit(s ) of the  and thus have fixed ourselves in the @xmath513 region .",
    "any ruler which can measure distances on our large radius circle manifold and give the correct answer will be unable to measure distances @xmath511 .",
    "to regain the @xmath510 picture of any distance existing but some being equivalent , one would take the moduli space @xmath118 and form the simply - connected , smooth covering space .",
    "the group by which one mods this covering space out by to form @xmath118 is the _ modular group _ of the target space @xmath4 . while there is nothing wrong with such a process from the mathematical point of view one should ask what the physical meaning of such a construction is . in terms of the  we have introduced negative areas but declared at the same time that they are entirely equivalent to positive areas .",
    "do such areas really exist ?",
    "the only way that they can be measured is to define the method of reading a ruler such that we get answers which would not agree with the large radius limit manifold but this is precisely where we try to make contact with our classical ideas of distance !    in conclusion",
    "we have shown that when building the moduli space of allowed , all distances , at least for the limit points , are non - negative . in this statement",
    "we mean non - negative when measured according to at least one of the smooth models of @xmath4 .",
    "some of the limit points , such as large - radius limit orbifolds , do admit zero distances however showing that string theory does not cut off distances shorter than the planck scale .",
    "we thank e. witten for helpful discussions .",
