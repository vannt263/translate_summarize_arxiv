    "ferromagnetic nanowires possess interesting properties that might be exploited in spintronic devices such as race - track type magnetic non - volatile memory called mram ( based on transverse domain - wall dynamics  @xcite ) and magnetic logic devices  @xcite .",
    "they might also be used in magnonic devices based on spin - wave excitation and propagation  @xcite .",
    "ferromagnetic nanowires have applications in microwave devices such as circulators  @xcite , superconducting single - photon ghz detectors and counters  @xcite , information storage ( as recording media and read - write devices ) , quantum transport ( such as gmr  @xcite circuits ) as well as in quantum computing and telecommunication .",
    "they are simpler than nanotubes since their physical properties do not depend on chirality and they can be grown with a variety of methods  @xcite : molecular beam epitaxy , electrochemical methods ( template synthesis , anodic alumina filters ) , chemical solution techniques ( self - assembly , sol - gel , emulsions ... ) and can be grown with a tunable number of monolayers and length  @xcite .    ordered arrays of nanowires",
    "may be of paramount importance in areas such as high - density patterned media information recording an example of which is the quantum magnetic disk  @xcite",
    ". they might be also of interest in novel high - frequency communication or signal - processing devices based on the exploitation of spin - waves ( in magnonic crystals made of magnetic superlattices or multilayers )  @xcite to transfer and process information or spin - currents with no dissipative joule effect .    in this work",
    ", we explore the possibility for nickel ferromagnetic nanowire arrays ( fna ) to be of interest in angle sensitive devices . for this goal",
    "we perform field angle dependent hysteresis loops and fmr lineshape measurements in the x - band ( 9.4 ghz ) .",
    "preisach analysis is applied to extract from the measured effective anisotropy field @xmath0 several angle dependent physical parameters ( such as interaction and coercivity ) while changing nanowire diameter from 15 nm to 100 nm .",
    "these findings might be exploited in angle dependent sensing devices that might compete with present amr or gmr angle sensors .",
    "this work is organized as follows : in section 2 , measured hysteresis loops versus field angle are presented and analyzed with preisach modeling , whereas in section 3 the same analysis is performed on the fmr lineshape measurements .",
    "we conclude the work in section 4 .",
    "appendix i details the fmr angular fitting procedure whereas appendix ii is a general overview of preisach modeling .",
    "our nickel fna are fabricated with an electrochemical deposition method similar to the one used by kartopu _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and the common length is 6 @xmath1 m for all diameters while the average interwire distance is about 350 nm .",
    "we have performed angle ( 0@xmath2 , 30@xmath2 , 45@xmath2 , 60@xmath2and 90@xmath2 ) dependent vsm ( vibrating sample magnetometry ) and fmr on these variable diameter ( 15 nm , 50 nm , 80 nm and 100 nm ) arrays from liquid helium ( 4.2 k ) to room temperature  @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the easy axis orientation for the 15 nm diameter sample is perpendicular to the wire axis in sharp contrast with the 50 nm , 80 nm and 100 nm samples .",
    "this is a surprising result since we expect ( from bulk ni ) that the easy axis along the wire axis by comparing the value of shape energy with respect to anisotropy energy .    ,",
    "applied field @xmath3 and corresponding angles @xmath4 they make with the nanowire axis that can be considered as an ellipsoid - shaped single domain with characteristic lengths @xmath5 and @xmath6 with @xmath7 the diameter .",
    "when the aspect ratio @xmath8 is large enough the ellipsoid becomes an infinite cylinder.,width=240 ]    results obtained from the angular behavior of the resonance field @xmath9 versus @xmath10 shows that @xmath9 is minimum at 90@xmath2for the 15 nm sample whereas it is minimum at 0@xmath2for the larger diameter samples agree with hysteresis loops obtained from vsm measurements and confirm presence of the transition of easy axis direction from perpendicular at 15 nm to parallel to nanowire axis at 50 nm diameter .    in this work",
    "we concentrate on room - temperature angle dependence experimental results and modeling .",
    "preisach modeling is used to understand the angular behavior of the hysteresis loops and the fmr lineshapes .",
    "after explaining the shortcomings of the classical preisach model ( cpm ) we use the preisach model for patterned media ( pm2 ) to interpret the static ( hysteresis loops ) and the dynamic ( fmr ) measurements for all angles and diameters .",
    "the preisach modeling we use is based essentially on probability densities for interaction @xmath11 and coercive @xmath12 fields .",
    "if we rotate the field distribution @xmath13 by 45@xmath2with respect to the reference system @xmath14 ( or switching field system ; see appendix i ) , we get the relations :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the distribution maximum",
    ".    the cpm density is given by a product of two gaussian densities pertaining to the interaction and coercive fields degrees of freedom :    @xmath17    where the standard deviation of the interaction and coercive fields are given by @xmath18 and @xmath19 respectively .",
    "the pm2 model is based on the following description :    @xmath20    where the normalized magnetization @xmath21 has been introduced as well as an average interaction field @xmath22 .",
    "the magnetization @xmath23 is determined by double integration over the field distribution ( see appendix i ) .",
    "moreover , coercivity is represented by a single gaussian density whereas interactions are represented by a superposition of two gaussian densities shifted to left and right with respect with respect to the average field @xmath22 .",
    "c +   +   +   +    loop inclination increases with @xmath18 whereas loop width increases with @xmath19 .",
    "hence interactions between `` hysterons '' ( or nanowires in our case ) are responsible for the inclination observed in the vsm hysteresis loops .",
    "the fit parameters are given in table  [ vsm_pm2 ] .",
    ".fitting parameters of the pm2 model of the hysteresis loops of ni 15 , 50 , 80 and 100 nm diameter samples when external field @xmath24 is along nanowire axis i.e. @xmath25 ( see fig .  [ coord ] ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ width ]    lorentz derivative widths generally decrease as we increase nanowire diameter for all angles . for a fixed diameter",
    ", they increase with angle in the 50 , 80 and 100 nm whereas in the 15 nm case they decrease .",
    "this originates from the fact , the 15 nm case possesses a large surface anisotropy as analysed previously in ref .",
    "@xcite , besides the lineshape behavior in this case is more complicated than the larger diameter cases .",
    "we have performed angular preisach analysis for the static ( vsm hysteresis loops ) and dynamic measurements ( fmr lineshape widths ) and shown that many results can be deeply understood and might be further developed in order to be embedded in applications such as angle detection sensors .",
    "the transition at 50 nm in vsm and fmr measurements is extremely promising because of several potential applications in race - track mram devices .",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite predicted that in permalloy nanowires of 50 nm and less , moving zero - mass domain walls may attain a velocity of several 100 m / s beating walker limit obeyed in permalloy strips with same lateral size .",
    "hence , nanowire cylindrical geometry in contrast to prismatic geometry of stripes bears important consequences on current injection in nanowires that applies slonczewski type torques  @xcite on magnetization affecting domain wall motion with reduced ohmic losses  @xcite .",
    "ordered arrays of nanowires are good candidates for patterned media and may also be used in plasmonic applications such as nano - antenna arrays or nanophotonic waveguides in integrated optics  @xcite .",
    "recently  @xcite , heat assisted magnetic perpendicular recording using plasmonic aperture nano - antenna has been tested on patterned media in order to process large storage densities starting at 1 tbits / in@xmath26 and scalable up to 100 tbits / in@xmath26 .",
    "while the preisach pm2 model can explain separately the static or dynamic results , one might extend it through the use of other distributions of interaction and coercivity in order to explain the vsm and fmr measurements simultaneously for all angles .",
    "nonetheless , the angular behavior of the linewidth is interesting enough to consider its use in angle sensors that might compete with present technology based on amr or gmr effects .",
    "some of the fmr measurements were kindly made by dr .",
    "r. zuberek at the institute of physics of the polish academy of science , warsaw ( poland ) .",
    "we have developed a procedure based on a least squares minimization procedure of the curve @xmath27 versus @xmath24 to the set of @xmath28 experimental measurements @xmath29}_{i=1,n}$ ] where @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath32 represents a set of fitting parameters .",
    "one of the parameters is the width @xmath33 obtained from a fitting procedure to the derivative of a lorentzian whose expression is given by : @xmath34_{\\mathscr{l}}=\\frac{a ( h - h_0)}{({\\delta h}^2 + ( h - h_0)^2)^2}\\ ] ]    @xmath16 is not a fitting parameter since it can be determined by the intersection of the lineshape with the @xmath24 axis .",
    "the parameters @xmath35 are determined with a fitting procedure .",

    "broyden method is selected because it can handle over or under - determined numerical problems and that it works from a singular value decomposition point of view @xcite .",
    "this means it is able to circumvent singularities and deliver a practical solution to the problem at hand as an optimal set@xcite within a minimal distance from the real one .",
    "preisach model  @xcite is based on a statistical approach towards magnetization processes @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the nanowire array is viewed as made of single domain interacting entities each nanowire being represented by a switching field and a local interaction field . the local interaction field in each nanowire",
    "is assumed to be constant .",
    "a system of interacting nanowires is represented by a probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath37 depending on interaction and coercive fields @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively .",
    "it represents the magnetic material into a collection of microscopic bistable units `` hysterons '' having statistically distributed coercive and interaction fields .",
    "each unit is characterized by a rectangular hysteresis loop ( see fig .",
    "[ pplane ] ) and its status is determined by the actual field and history of the applied external fields .",
    "the classical version ( cpm ) of the model is based on the use of a joint distribution of normalized interaction fields @xmath41 and coercive fields @xmath42 .",
    "the interaction fields @xmath41 induce a shift in the elementary hysteresis loop ( see fig .  [ pplane ] ) whereas the coercive fields increase its width . integrating the density over a given path in the preisach plane",
    "yields a magnetization process .",
    "mayergoyz  @xcite has demonstrated that the necessary and sufficient conditions for a system to be rigorously described by a cpm are the wiping - out and congruency properties  @xcite .",
    "a hysteretic system will present the wiping - out property when it returns to the same state after performing a minor loop .",
    "the second property refers to the shape of the minor loops measured in the same field range ; if all these minor loops are congruent within a given field range and this property does not depend on the actual field range used in the experiment , the system obeys the congruency property .",
    "the major hysteresis loop is obtained when a path linear in the applied field is used @xcite , @xcite .",
    "thus , in order to estimate the the hysteresis loop , we determine the magnetization @xmath23 with a double integration over the pdf as given below :        the @xmath46 pdf can be either analytically built from standard pdf ( gaussian , lorentzian , uniform etc ... ) or experimentally determined from forc ( first order reversal curves ) measurements .",
    "this originates from the fact magnetic interactions between nanowires are a major determinant of noise levels in magnetic media whether it is used for storage or processing such as in spintronics .",
    "while conventional methods of characterizing magnetic interactions utilize isothermal remanent magnetization ( irm ) and remanence dc demagnetization ( dcd ) curves  @xcite , preisach modeling is based on some distribution which is supposed to adequately describe the magnetic system at hand .",
    "forc is a popular measurement leading to an appropriate preisach model .",
    "it begins with sample saturation with a large positive field .",
    "the field is ramped down to a reversal field @xmath47 .",
    "forc consists of a measurement of the magnetization as the field is then increased from @xmath47 back up to saturation .",
    "the magnetization at applied field @xmath48 on the forc with reversal point @xmath47 is denoted by @xmath49 , where @xmath50 .",
    "let us assume we adopt a double lorentzian pdf given by : @xmath52 } \\times \\nonumber \\\\ \\frac{1 } { [ 1+(\\frac{h_i+h_c - h_0}{\\sigma_i h_0})^2 ] [ 1+(\\frac{h_i - h_c - h_0}{\\sigma_i h_0})^2 ] } \\label{lorentz}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath53 a set of normalized fields , @xmath54 the standard deviation of the individual lorentzian / gaussian distributions considered as independent ) we find hysteresis loops that are upstraight whereas the vsm measured loops exhibit some inclination .",
    "nevertheless both approaches do not agree with the hysteresis loops that we find experimentally as described by dumitru _",
    "et al . _",
    "this is why we use the pm2 model as explained in section [ preisach ] .",
