    "spin transport in semiconductor nanostructures has attracted significant research interest due to its promising role in implementing novel devices which operate at decreased power level and enhanced data processing speed .",
    "additionally , spin is considered to be the ideal candidate for encoding qubits in quantum logic gates @xcite because spin coherence time in semiconductors @xcite is much longer than charge coherence time @xcite .    in this paper , we study spin transport of electrons in a quasi one - dimensional structure . in the past , we established @xcite that in a spinfet configuration where the ferromagnetic source and drain contacts are magnetized _ along _ the axis of the quasi one - dimensional channel , the spin dephasing time ( @xmath6 ) is about @xmath7 ns for an electric field of @xmath5kv / cm and @xmath8 ns for an electric field of @xmath9v / cm , at a ( lattice ) temperature of @xmath2k .",
    "spin dephasing time was much less when the contacts were magnetized along any other direction . in the present work , we highlight the spatial variation of spin polarization along the channel for this `` large @xmath6 '' configuration using a multi - subband monte carlo simulator .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in the next section , we describe the theory followed by a brief description of the monte carlo simulator in section iii and results in section iv .",
    "finally we conclude in section v.",
    "fig.[structure ] shows the schematic of the quasi one - dimensional semiconductor structure .",
    "an electric field @xmath10 is applied along the axis of the quantum wire to induce current flow .",
    "in addition , there could be another transverse field @xmath11 to cause rashba spin - orbit interaction .",
    "such a field is indeed present in some spintronic devices e.g. a spin interferometer proposed in @xcite .",
    "spin polarized electrons are injected at one end of the wire from a half - metallic contact with the spin vector oriented along the wire axis .",
    "our goal is to investigate how the injected spin polarization decays along the channel as the electrons traverse the quantum wire under the influence of electric fields @xmath10 and @xmath11 while being subjected to various elastic and inelastic scattering events .        in reality , the spin and spatial wavefunctions of the electrons are coupled together via _ spin - orbit coupling _ hamiltonian and hence spin dephasing ( or depolarization ) rates are functionals of the electron distribution function in momentum space .",
    "the distribution function in momentum space continuously evolves with time when an electric field is applied to drive transport .",
    "thus , the dephasing rate is a dynamic variable that needs to be treated self - consistently in step with the dynamic evolution of the electrons momenta .",
    "such situations are best treated by monte carlo simulation .",
    "following saikin @xcite , we describe electron s spin by standard spin density matrix formalism @xcite : @xmath12   \\label{spin_density}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is related to the spin polarization component as @xmath13 where @xmath14 = @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 denotes pauli spin matrices .",
    "assume _ that in a small time interval @xmath19 t no scattering takes place and the electron accelerates very slowly due to the driving electric field ( in other words , @xmath20 t is sufficiently small ) . during this interval @xmath19 t",
    "we describe electron s transport by a constant `` average wavevector '' : @xmath21 during this interval , the spin density matrix undergoes a unitary evolution according to @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the momentum dependent hamiltonian that has two main contributions due to the bulk inversion asymmetry ( dresselhaus interaction ) @xcite @xmath24 and the structural inversion asymmetry ( rashba interaction ) @xcite @xmath25 the constants @xmath26 and @xmath27 depend on the material and , in case of @xmath27 , also on the external electric field @xmath11 that breaks inversion symmetry .",
    "equation ( [ evolution ] ) describes a rotation of the average spin vector about an effective magnetic field given by the magnitude of the average wavevector ( @xmath28 ) during the time interval @xmath29 .",
    "the assumption of constant @xmath28 implies that spin dynamics is coherent during @xmath29 and there is no dephasing ( reduction of magnitude ) since the evolution is _",
    "unitary_. however , the electric field @xmath10 changes the value of the average wavevector @xmath28 from one interval to the other . also , the stochastic scattering event that takes place between two successive intervals changes the value of @xmath28 .",
    "these two factors produce a distribution of spin states that results in effective dephasing .",
    "thus the evolution of the spin polarization vector @xmath30 ( with components @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) can be viewed as coherent motion ( rotation ) coupled with dephasing / depolarization ( reduction in magnitude ) .",
    "this type of dephasing is the dyakonov - perel relaxation which is a dominant mechanism for spin dephasing in one - dimensional structures .",
    "another spin dephasing mechanism is the elliott - yafet relaxation @xcite which causes instantaneous spin flip during a momentum relaxing scattering .",
    "however , in quasi one - dimensional structures momentum relaxing events are strongly suppressed because of the one - dimensional constriction of phase space for scattering .",
    "so we can neglect this effect as a first approximation .",
    "the third important spin dephasing mechanism , known as bir - aronov - pikus mechanism accrues from exchange coupling between electrons and holes .",
    "this effect is absent in unipolar transport .",
    "apart from these three , spin relaxation may take place due to magnetic field caused by local magnetic impurities , nuclei spin and other spin orbit coupling effects .",
    "however , in this work we consider only the dyakonov - perel mechanism which is the most important spin dephasing mechanism in quantum wires of technologically important semiconductors like @xmath0",
    ".    we can recast ( [ evolution ] ) in the following form for the temporal evolution of the spin vector : @xmath34 where the so - called `` precession vector '' @xmath35 has two components @xmath36 and @xmath37 due to the bulk inversion asymmetry ( dresselhaus interaction ) and the structural inversion asymmetry ( rashba interaction ) respectively : @xmath38 @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are material constants and @xmath42 is the dimension of the wire along @xmath17 direction . in our work we take @xmath40 = 2@xmath43@xmath44 ev - m@xmath45 , @xmath41 = @xmath46@xmath43@xmath47 c - m@xmath48 and @xmath11 = 100kv / cm which are reasonable for @xmath49 heterostructures",
    ". solution of ( [ s ] ) is straightforward and analytical expressions for @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 can be obtained quite easily ( see @xcite ) . we note that spin is conserved for every individual electron during @xmath29 , i.e. @xmath53",
    "the average value of the wavevector in a time interval @xmath29 depends on the initial value of the wavevector @xmath54 at the beginning of the interval .",
    "intervals are chosen such that a scattering event can occur only at the beginning or end of an interval .",
    "the choice of scattering events and the wavevector state after the event ( i.e. the time evolution of the wavevector ) are found from a monte carlo solution of the boltzmann transport equation in a quantum wire @xcite .",
    "the following scattering mechanisms are included : surface optical phonons , polar and non - polar acoustic phonons and confined polar optical phonons .",
    "a multi - subband simulation is employed ; upto six subbands can be occupied in the @xmath16 direction and only one transverse subband is occupied along the @xmath17 direction even for the highest energy an electron can reach .",
    "this is because the width of the wire ( @xmath16-dimension ) in our simulation is @xmath2 nm and the thickness ( @xmath17 dimension ) is only @xmath46 nm . hard wall boundary conditions are applied .",
    "the details of the simulator can be found in @xcite .",
    "we solve ( [ s ] ) directly in the monte carlo simulator .",
    "the simulation has been carried out in the absence of any external magnetic field , although the monte carlo simulation allows inclusion of such a field .",
    "we consider the case when the electrons are injected at the left end ( @xmath15 = @xmath55 ) of the quantum wire with their spins initially polarized along the axis of the wire ( i.e along @xmath15 axis ) . in order to maintain current continuity ,",
    "as soon as an electron exits from the right end of the wire , it is re - injected at the left end .",
    "the spin polarization of this electron is re - oriented along @xmath15 direction .      in fig.[compare_e ] , we show how the magnitude of the `` average spin vector''@xmath56 ( defined later ) decays along the channel for four different values of the driving electric field @xmath10 . for this study , we have set lattice temperature = @xmath2k and length of the channel = @xmath57 m .    the quantity @xmath56 is calculated as follows : at each point @xmath15 along the channel we compute `` ensemble average '' of the spin components during the entire evolution time @xmath58 .",
    "mathematically , this can be expressed as @xmath59 here @xmath60 denotes the components @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , @xmath61 denotes number of electrons in a bin of size @xmath62 centered around @xmath15 at time @xmath63 , @xmath64 denotes the @xmath60 th component of spin corresponding to the n th electron and is derived from equation ( [ s ] ) .",
    "the `` average spin vector '' is defined as : @xmath65^\\frac{1}{2}\\ ] ]    fig.[compare_e ] is the snapshot of this `` time - averaged ensemble spin polarization '' ( @xmath56 ) along the channel for @xmath58 = @xmath66 ns . it has been found ( though not shown ) that @xmath56 is almost independent of the evolution time @xmath58 for @xmath67ns .",
    "so we can deem fig.[compare_e ] as `` steady state '' spin polarization along the channel .",
    "we note that the decay characteristic resembles an exponential trend .",
    "therefore we define the spin dephasing length ( @xmath68 ) as the distance ( measured from left end ) where @xmath56 decays to @xmath69 times its initial value of @xmath70 . for @xmath10 = @xmath5 kv / cm ( or voltage across the channel = @xmath71 = @xmath72 volts ) , @xmath73 @xmath74@xmath75 m .",
    "earlier , spin transport of electrons in iii - v semiconductor quantum well and heterostructures was carried out by bournel et al .",
    "@xcite and privman et al .",
    "typical spin dephasing length was found to be @xmath76 @xmath77 m . in our present study",
    "we observe _ an order of magnitude increase _ in spin dephasing length .",
    "this is due to suppression of momentum relaxing events in one dimension ( i.e. electron - phonon scattering ) that also suppresses dyakonov - perel spin relaxation .",
    "we also note from fig.[compare_e ] that spin polarization along the channel is weakly dependent on driving electric field @xmath10 . at higher applied voltage ( e.g. @xmath10 = @xmath46kv / cm ) ,",
    "drift velocity is larger compared to the case when @xmath10 = @xmath5 kv / cm .",
    "this effect leads to slight increase in the spin dephasing length . also at high electric field , scattering probability increases which tends to decrease the spin dephasing length .",
    "we observe that for @xmath10 = @xmath78kv / cm or @xmath72kv / cm the later effect dominates over the first , leading to smaller @xmath68 .     quantum wire at @xmath2k for various driving electric fields .",
    "spins are injected with their polarization initially aligned along the wire axis .",
    "position x is measured in meters.,width=652 ]      , @xmath16 and @xmath17 components of spin in the @xmath0 quantum wire structure at @xmath2k .",
    "the driving electric field ( @xmath10 ) is @xmath5kv / cm and the spins are injected with their polarization initially aligned along the wire axis .",
    "position x is measured in meters.,width=576 ]    fig.[components ] shows how the average spin components ( defined as @xmath79 in ( [ average_i ] ) ) decay along the channel .",
    "the driving electric field @xmath10 = @xmath5kv / cm and the lattice temperature is @xmath2k . since , initially the spin is polarized along the @xmath15 direction , the ensemble averaged @xmath16 and @xmath17 components remain near zero and the ensemble averaged @xmath15 component decays along the channel .",
    "the decay of the ensemble averaged @xmath15 component is indistinguishable from the decay of @xmath56 ( defined in ( [ average ] ) ) shown in fig.[components ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that the spatial decay of the @xmath15 component along the channel is monotonic with no hint of any oscillatory component which generally manifests for @xmath16 and @xmath17 polarized injections ( not shown in this paper but see @xcite ) .",
    "the oscillatory component is a manifestation of the coherent dynamics ( spin rotation ) while the monotonic decay is a result of incoherent dynamics ( spin dephasing or depolarization ) .",
    "there is a competition between these two dynamics determined by the relative magnitudes of the rotation rate ( @xmath80 ) and the dephasing rate . for the @xmath15 component ,",
    "the rotation rate is weak because it is solely due to rashba interaction which is weak .",
    "hence the dephasing dynamics wins handsomely resulting in no oscillatory component .",
    "in this paper , we have shown how spin dephases in a quasi one dimensional structure .",
    "it has been found that the spin dephasing length is @xmath76 @xmath3 m in a @xmath0 @xmath70-d channel at liquid nitrogen temperature which is an _ order of magnitude _ improvement over two dimensional channels .",
    "this effect can be exploited in the design of a gate controlled spin interferometer where the suppression of spin dephasing is a critical issue .",
