    "thermal and charge transport properties are so much related to each other",
    ". charge conductivity of the normal - superconductor ( n / s ) junctions at first was discussed by blonder , tinkham , and klapwijk ( btk ) @xcite theoretically and their results could show good consistence with experiments .",

    "as shown in fig.[fig : kapavsl ] , the normalized thermal conductance shows intensive oscillatory behavior versus width of superconductor region . this manner is a consequence of the coherent interference of the dirac fermions in facing with two interfaces .",
    "also , by increasing the width of superconducting region , the normalized thermal conductance loses the amplitude of its oscillation and shows exponentially decrement towards single junction . when the dirac fermions lose their coherency , they show the mentioned manner and this illustrates the fact that when the width of the superconducting region becomes larger , the probability of tunneling of the dirac fermions across the superconducting region is reduced .",

    "we found that for single junction ( f / s ) the normalized thermal conductance indicates the previous exponential form vs. temperature . increasing exchange field",
    "@xmath2 lowers the propagating modes of the dirac fermions down to a minimum value . due to the tunneling phenomena of the dirac fermions through the superconducting layer , the heat transport properties of the double f / s / f junctions are different from single f / s junction .",
