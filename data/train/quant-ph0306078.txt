    "entanglement and secret correlation share an `` exclusiveness ''  in the one case towards the total outside world , in the other towards an entity `` eve ''  that has led quantum information scientists to speculate on a systematic relation between their theories : the works in this direction range from building analogies  @xcite to using entanglement to prove information theoretic security of quantum key distribution  @xcite , to attempts to prove the equivalence of the distillability of secret key and of entanglement  @xcite .",
    "of course there are also conceptual differences : while the task of distilling secret perfect correlation derives from potential cryptographic applications ( and requires a third , malicious , party to formulate the operational problem ) , entanglement is useful for simple transmission tasks between two perfectly cooperating parties , as exemplified by dense coding  @xcite and teleportation  @xcite .",
    "the present paper falls into the third of the above categories , for we address the two questions , of distilling secret key from many copies of a quantum state ( itself a generalisation of classical information theoretic work begun by maurer  @xcite and ahlswede and csiszr  @xcite ) by public discussion and of distilling epr pairs by local operations and classical communication ( locc ) , in a unified way . to be more precise , after describing a protocol for secret key distillation from a state by one  way public discussion ,",
    "we show how secrecy codes of a particular structure can be converted into one  way locc entanglement distillation protocols achieving the _ coherent information _ , as was conjectured for some time under the name of the `` hashing inequality '' ( after the hashing protocol in  @xcite which attains the bound for bell  diagonal two  qubit states ) .",
    "it is well  known from  @xcite that this inequality yields information theoretic characterisations of distillable entanglement under general locc , as well as the quantum transmission capacity , without , with forward and with bidirectional classical side channel ( the first of these capacity theorems proved recently by shor  @xcite , following a heuristic argument of lloyd  @xcite , and subseqently in  @xcite ) .",
    "our approach is very close to that of  @xcite , and  as far as secret key distillation is concerned  the work  @xcite : while here our resource is a three  party quantum state ( `` static '' model ) , these papers deal with the `` dynamic '' analogue , where the resource is a quantum / wiretap channel .    as for the structure of the paper : the main result of the cryptographic part is theorem  [ thm : cqq:1way : coding ] in section  [ sec : oneway - secret : cqq ] ; the form of the optimal rates is then not hard to obtain , as we shall show in the detailed discussion .",
    "it is theorem  [ thm : cqq:1way : coding ] which we return to in the entanglement distillation part : a very general modification of the coding procedure will give us theorem  [ thm : hashing ] , the hashing inequality ; and as before , the form of the optimal rates is not hard to get from there .",
    "a reader only interested in entanglement distillation can thus skip the second part of section  [ sec : oneway - secret : cqq ] : there the general form of optimal one  way distillable secret key is derived . in section  [ sec : oneway - ent ] we turn to one  way entanglement distillation , proving the hashing inequality and exhibiting the general form of optimal one  way distillation ; then in section  [ sec : cap - and - ent ] the consequences of the hashing inequality are detailed .",

    "however , the proof as indicated above does not work in this case : indeed we may use the back  communication to help distillation , but teleportation needs a _ forward _ communication , so we end up with a quantum channel code utilising two  way classical side communication , which is not known to be reducible to just back  communication : in fact , the results of bowen  @xcite might be taken as indication that for the erasure channel the capacities with feedback and with two  way side communication are different .",
    "we have already given a formula for the distillable entanglement using one  way locc in theorem  [ thm:1way - ent ] :    [ thm : ent : capacities ] for any state @xmath43 , @xmath305 with any two  way locc operation @xmath300 and the coherent information refers to the state @xmath306 .",
    "for the direct part ( `` @xmath162 '' ) it is obviously sufficient to consider any two  way locc operation @xmath300 on the bipartite system , which applied to @xmath8 gives a state @xmath307 .",

    "thus , @xmath313 and we are done .",

    "only recently hamada  @xcite succeeded in giving a lower bound on quantum channel capacity in terms of coherent information  still with a crucial restriction to stabiliser codes .",
    "it took until  @xcite for a full proof to be found  but then quite quickly one of us  @xcite discovered a proof based on private information transmission , an idea inspired by the work of schumacher and westmoreland  @xcite .    regarding entanglement distillation",

    "it was codified as an important conjecture in  @xcite .    while completing the writing of the present paper we learned of the work  @xcite , in which it is shown that the proof by random coding of the channel capacity theorem can be used to obtin the hashing inequality .",
    "it may be interesting to compare the proofs  @xcite for the achievability of the coherent information to ours and  @xcite .",
    "while we , on the face of it , take a detour via secret key distillation , the final procedure can be argued more direct : in particular , we do nt require the `` double blocking '' which in the other approaches seem necessary to reduce to a situation in which alice s end is in a maximally mixed state .",
    "thus , presumably , our codes achieve rates approaching the coherent information more quickly , i.e.  for smaller block length .",
    "our findings not only transport an existing classical theory of distilling secret key from prior correlation ( maurer  @xcite , ahlswede and csiszr  @xcite , and follow  up work ) to the quantum case , but also link this subject to entanglement distillation in an operational way : a coherent implementation of the basic secret key distillation protocol yielded an entanglement distillation protocol achieving the coherent information  this then implies information theoretic formulas for distillable entanglement and quantum capacities .",
    "we want to draw the reader s attention to several open question that we have to leave : first of all , are there states for which @xmath316 ? are there maybe even bound entangled states with positive key rate ?",

    "note that the potential gap between @xmath318 and @xmath319 comes from the possibility to have more general measurements at alice s side than the complete von neumann measurement in the schmidt basis that was our starting point in the proof of theorem  [ thm : hashing ] ( actually any complete von neumann measurement would do ) : namely , in key distillation , a viable option for alice is to discard part of her state ( corresponding to using higher rank povm elements ) , but keep that part secret from eve all the same ; while in entanglement distillation , ` eve' is everything except alice and bob , so it is as if she would get the parts alice decided to toss away .    a second group of open questions : in general , the optimisations in theorems  [ thm : cqq:1way - key ] , [ thm : qqq:1way - key ] and  [ thm:1way - ent ] are quite nasty , most so because they involve a limit of many copies of the state . in the classical theory of secret key distillation , a single ",

  "abstract_text": [
    "<S> we study and solve the problem of distilling secret key from quantum states representing correlation between two parties ( alice and bob ) and an eavesdropper ( eve ) via one  way public discussion : we prove a coding theorem to achieve the `` wire  tapper '' bound , the difference of the mutual information alice  bob and that of alice  eve , for so  called cqq  correlations , via one  way public communication . </S>",
    "<S> this result yields information  theoretic formulas for the distillable secret key , giving `` ultimate '' key rate bounds if eve is assumed to possess a purification of alice and bob s joint state .    </S>",
    "<S> specialising our protocol somewhat and making it coherent leads us to a protocol of entanglement distillation via one  way locc ( local operations and classical communication ) which is asymptotically optimal : in fact we prove the so  called `` hashing inequality '' which says that the coherent information ( i.e. , the negative conditional von neumann entropy ) is an achievable epr rate . </S>",
    "<S> this result is well  known to imply a whole set of distillation and capacity formulas which we briefly review . </S>"
