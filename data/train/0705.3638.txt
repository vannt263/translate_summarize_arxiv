    "a growing body of theoretical models backed by emerging observational evidence paints a picture of joint formation and evolution of galaxies and quasars ; for reviews see , e.g. , the proceedings edited by @xcite , @xcite , and references therein . in this picture , merger - driven build - up of massive halos trigger both vigorous star formation and fuel the central black hole igniting a quasar @xcite .",
    "agn feedback is now believed to be an essential factor in the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "understanding the agn - starburst connection is especially interesting at high redshifts , as we probe the epoch of the initial assembly of massive galaxies .",
    "observationally , this is challenging in the case of host galaxies of luminous type  i quasars , as the agn activity far outshines any star formation related processes .",
    "however , by observing lower luminosity type  i quasars or type  ii ( e.g. , obscured ) quasars , the blinding intensity of the central engine is reduced , allowing properties of the host galaxy to be studied .    in this letter , we report the discovery of two low - luminosity type  i quasars where we may be seeing evidence for a simultaneous starburst with a top - heavy imf , and agn activity .",
    "both quasars show a prominent , moderately - broad ] @xmath3  emission line , which is rarely seen in quasar spectra at any redshift .",
    "the two objects are low - luminosity quasars at @xmath0 , found in a sample of 23 objects used to measure the low - luminosity end of the quasar luminosity function ( qlf ) at @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the parent sample ranges in redshift from @xmath4 to @xmath5 .",
    "the candidates for this sample were selected from the noao deep wide field survey ( ndwfs ) botes field @xcite and the deep lens survey ( dls ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "quasar candidates were selected based on the colors of simulated quasars in the @xmath6 redshift range , incorporating a range of spectral slopes , ly@xmath7 equivalent widths , and intervening neutral hydrogen absorbers , down to the limiting magnitude of @xmath8 .",
    "finding charts for the two ] quasars are presented in figure [ fig : finding_charts ] .",
    "details of the survey and candidate selection will be presented by bogosavljevi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .",
    "we obtained spectroscopic followup for our candidates on ut 2006 may 20 through 22 with the low - resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the keck i telescope .",
    "only the red camera was used , with the 400 lines mm@xmath9 grating blazed at 8500 .",
    "the spectra were reduced using bogus , an iraf package developed by stern , bunker , & stanford for reducing slitmask data , modified slightly for our single - slit data .",
    "dls1053@xmath100528 was discovered in a 1800 second exposure of a candidate in the dls f4 field and ndwfs1433@xmath113408 was identified from a 900 second exposure of a candidate in the botes field .",
    "the final spectra are presented in figure [ fig : spectra ] and the source parameters are listed in table [ table : data ] .",
    "several things are worth noting .",
    "first is the detection of the ] @xmath3  emission lines , which is particularly strong in dls1053@xmath100528 ( e.g. , in comparison with the @xmath12  line ) . at the same time",
    ", the commonly observed @xmath13  emission line is entirely absent , and may even be seen in absorption in dls1053@xmath100528 ( see figure [ fig : niv_fits ] ) .",
    "this latter observation is somewhat unusual since the @xmath14  line in this source does not show broad absorption . while broad absorption lines are seen in approximately 10% of quasars , such quasars will show broad absorption in all permitted species .",
    "the permitted emission lines for the two ] quasars are narrow compared with typical quasar line - widths . a single component voigt fit to ly@xmath7 measures a full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath15 km s@xmath9 . since the blue side of the ly@xmath7 profile is absorbed , we forced symmetry in the line by mirroring the red side of the line profile over the peak wavelength . to search for a broad - line component",
    "we fit a two - component gaussian to the ly@xmath7 profile . for dls1053@xmath100528",
    ", we measure a narrow - line fwhm of 434 km s@xmath9 and a broad - line fwhm of 1727 km s@xmath9 . in ndwfs1433@xmath113408",
    "we measure a narrow - line fwhm of 713 km s@xmath9 and a broad - line fwhm of 3015 km s@xmath9 . therefore , while these objects have significant contribution from their narrow - line components ( @xmath16 of the line flux in dls1053@xmath100528 and @xmath17 in ndwfs1433@xmath113408 ) , their broad - line velocities of @xmath18 km s@xmath9 place them in the quasar regime . using the velocity widths from the broad - line component of ly@xmath7 as a proxy for or h@xmath19 , and the black hole mass estimators from @xcite and @xcite , we obtain @xmath20 for dls1053@xmath100528 and @xmath21 for ndwfs1433@xmath113408 .",
    "consistent with the somewhat narrow line widths ( for a broad - lined quasar ) and the low - luminosity , these inferred black hole masses are much lower than the masses inferred for luminous quasars .    on ut 2007 january 23 we imaged dls1053@xmath100528 with the slit - viewing camera ( scam ) of the nirspec instrument on keck - ii .",
    "we used the @xmath22-band filter and imaged the source with a 9-point dither pattern of 120 second exposures , for a total of 1080 seconds at the position of the quasar .",
    "the seeing was 07 .",
    "the data were reduced using the xdimsum package in iraf .",
    "we calibrate our image to the 2mass @xmath22-band using a 15.26 magnitude point source that is detected in the field .",
    "the quasar is not detected , with a 3@xmath23 magnitude threshold of 24.9 ( vega ) magnitudes .",
    "ndwfs1433@xmath113408 was observed as part of flamex , a near - infrared survey overlapping 4.1 deg@xmath24 of the botes area @xcite .",
    "the quasar is detected at @xmath25 in both the @xmath22 and @xmath26 images .",
    "in addition , this quasar was observed in the irac shallow survey , an 8.5 deg@xmath24 _",
    "imaging survey of the botes field @xcite .",
    "the source is faintly ( @xmath27 ) detected at 3.6  and 4.5  at 19.0 and 19.1 ( vega ) magnitudes , respectively .",
    "we list the 4  aperture magnitude from the flamex catalog as well as the irac detections in table [ table : data ] .",
    "the quasar is not detected in the 5.8  or 8.0  images , whose @xmath28 detection thresholds are @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( vega ; 3aperture ) magnitudes , respectively .",
    "note that the [ 3.6]@xmath10[4.5 ] colors for this object are quite blue compared to typical mid - infrared colors of agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the result is not unexpected : at @xmath31 , h@xmath7 emission is shifted into the shortest wavelength irac band , causing agn at this redshift to have blue [ 3.6]@xmath10[4.5 ] colors .",
    "figure [ fig : sed ] plots the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of both objects , using all available photometry .",
    "we compare this sed with the sdss composite spectrum @xcite as well as the starburst template from @xcite with @xmath32 , both shifted to @xmath33 .",
    "significant deviations are seen , especially at long wavelengths where both objects appear much bluer than the average quasar and starbusrt spectra .",
    "the sed of ndwfs1433@xmath113408 seems more consistent with the starburst spectrum , at least in the rest - frame ultraviolet , but dls1053@xmath100528 deviates strongly from both .",
    "the most striking feature in the spectra of these two faint quasars is the presence of the extremely unusual ] @xmath3  emission line .",
    "the quasar population generally shows remarkable spectroscopic similarity out to the highest observed redshifts , with no obvious signs of evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "_ none _ of the published average quasar spectral templates show any trace of the ] @xmath34  line ( figure [ fig : composites ] ) . the top spectrum ( solid line )",
    "is the sdss quasar composite from @xcite .",
    "the quasars that contribute to this part of the spectrum are at redshifts comparable to the quasars in our sample , but they sample the bright end of the quasar luminosity function .",
    "the bottom spectrum ( dotted line ) is the _ hst _ uv composite spectrum from @xcite . the objects contributing to this part of the spectrum are low - redshift quasars ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the only strong detection of this line in a quasar that we are aware of is in the nitrogen quasar q0353@xmath10383 @xcite .",
    "this object has been analyzed by @xcite who derive an overabundance of nitrogen by a factor as high as @xmath36 times solar in this object .",
    "a sample of apparently nitrogen - rich quasars was compiled by @xcite from the 6650 quasars in the sdss dr1 database with @xmath37 ( allowing for the detection of ] @xmath3and ] @xmath38 ) .",
    "@xcite estimate that `` nitrogen - enriched '' quasars make up at most @xmath39 of quasars .",
    "their sample has luminosities in the range @xmath40 to @xmath41 .",
    "we found two such objects in a sample of 23 quasars ( @xmath42 ) that are concentrated at @xmath43 and are 0.7 magnitudes deeper than the sdss sample .",
    "they found 20 quasars with equivalent widths @xmath44 2.0  in both nitrogen lines and 33 quasars with ews @xmath44 2.0in only one of the nitrogen lines . in these quasars",
    "the ] @xmath3  line is accompanied by similarly strong @xmath13  and ] @xmath38 , the latter of which is outside our wavelengths range .",
    "we fit voigt profiles to the nitrogen lines in our spectra ( as well as to ly@xmath7 and @xmath12 ) to determine line fluxes , equivalent widths and dispersion velocities ( table [ table : lines ] , figure [ fig : niv_fits ] ) .",
    "the mean ] @xmath3  equivalent widths for the @xcite sample is 3.7  ( @xmath45 1.5 ) , while the equivalent widths of ] @xmath3  for our quasars are 280.2  for the dls source and @xmath46  for the botes source .",
    "this , combined with the non - detection ( and possible absorption ) of @xmath13in the dls source suggests that these quasars may be of a different ilk than the `` nitrogen - enriched '' population .    in galaxies with no agn signature , we are aware of only two other instances of this line being seen in the high - redshift universe .",
    "one especially telling detection is in the spectrum of the lynx arc , a gravitationally lensed hii galaxy at z=3.357 @xcite .",
    "the line intensities in this object s spectrum , strong ] @xmath47 , ] @xmath48 , and ] @xmath49 , as well as the absence of @xmath13 , favor a hot ( 80,000 k ) blackbody over an agn as the ionizing source .",
    "the @xcite modeling of the spectrum suggests a top heavy imf , which is especially interesting since such an imf is now believed to be characteristic of early , metal poor star formation , e.g. population  iii stars .",
    "alternatively , @xcite suggest an obscured agn as the photoionizing source of the lynx arc .",
    "their model invokes dense absorbing gas near a central agn that filters the powerlaw and mimicks the hot blackbody suggested by @xcite this model does require at least a weak @xmath13line detection .",
    "the second known ] @xmath3  emitter is a @xmath50 galaxy in the goods survey @xcite .",
    "similar to the lynx arc , this object shows an extremely strong ly@xmath7 line as well as ] @xmath3 , while @xmath13is absent .",
    "no detailed analysis has been published on this source as yet .",
    "an alternative possibility is that we are witnessing an evolutionary effect in the quasar broad - emission - line region .",
    "this is suggested by the traditional broad - line shape of @xmath3in dls1053@xmath100528 as well the peculiar absence ( or even absorption ) of @xmath13   in its spectrum .",
    "detailed modeling of such effects is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the detection of such a rare emission line in two out of 23 @xmath43 quasars in our sample ( i.e. , @xmath51% of the sample ) suggests that it occurs more commonly in low luminosity quasars at high redshifts , a regime which we are now exploring systematically for the first time . at these luminosities we are probing deep into the qlf where",
    "the effects of a luminous starbursts can be detected more easily ; if there is an evolutionary trend , such phenomena may be present at high redshifts , and not in the better studied quasar samples at @xmath52 .",
    "as the sample sizes of comparably faint agn at these redshifts increase , we will be able to determine whether this is indeed a systematic evolutionary effect related to the early stages of co - formation and co - evolution of galaxies and agn .",
