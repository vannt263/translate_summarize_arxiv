    "in other words , the frequency shift , and hence the qualitative dynamics of the system , is determined by the ratio between the josephson energy and the thermal energy .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : gfun ] , the frequency shift @xmath104 is shown for four different values of this ratio . for low resonator amplitudes ( small @xmath91 ) , the resonant frequency shifts downwards upon increasing the noise . as amplitude increases , either softening or hardening is observed depending on the noise power .",

    "the squid phase thus behaves as a classical two - level - system ( tls ) whose state depends on amplitude of the resonator . in this limit ,",
    "the frequency shift @xmath104 approaches @xmath127j_1(|u|)/|u|.$ ] hence , the zeros of @xmath128 separates regions where the oscillator response is shifted away from or coincides with the unperturbed lorentzian line shape : i.e. , between regions where it has ordinary linear behavior and where it behaves as a driven holweck - lejay - like resonator .    as noise increases , one sees from fig .",
    "[ fig : gfun ] that the sharp features of the frequency shift @xmath104 are smoothed out , and only at discrete amplitudes @xmath91 corresponding to zeros of @xmath129 , will the frequency shift vanish .",
    "hence , in the presence of noise the piecewise linear behavior in @xmath91 obtained for @xmath130 is destroyed , and for strong noise @xmath131 .",
    "we conclude that by varying the noise intensity , the frequency response can be tuned .",
    "the shape of the response curve is also influenced by the drive strength . as expected , and also shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : gfun ] , the resonance peak is lorentzian for small @xmath62 , but quickly takes on a flame - like character as the driving force increases .",
    "however , as the drive amplitude increases further , the response once more resembles a lorentzian .",
    "this can again be traced back to the structure of the frequency detuning function @xmath104 , which decays algebraically with @xmath91 .",
    "consequently , the frequency shift near the top of the resonance peak quickly decays with increasing @xmath62 . at the base of the resonance , on the other hand ,",
    "the width of the peak is of order @xmath132 , whereas the frequency detuning scales with @xmath29 .",
    "hence , we expect no visible nonlinear response when @xmath133 .      the stochastic equations of motion  -",
    "were numerically integrated using a second - order algorithm  @xcite , with the parameter values listed in table  [ tab : params ] .",
    "these correspond to @xmath110 .    to begin with , the resonant response of the lc - circuit",

    "[ sec : analytics ] is excellent .    , and @xmath110 .",

    "in order to further check the validity of the discussion in sec .  [ sec : analytics ] , we extracted the distribution of @xmath136 for states stabilized at a certain envelope amplitude @xmath91 . the result is shown in fig .  [ fig : switch ] .",
    "( a ) , where switching between integer and half - integer @xmath85 is clearly evident .",
    "the sections where no values are plotted are those @xmath91 where no stable state could be found , due to that @xmath137 . for comparison , fig .",
    "[ fig : switch ]  ( b ) includes the theoretical response curve together with the lorentzian @xmath138 . in agreement with the discussion above",
    ", there is a clear correspondence between integer @xmath85 and regions where the resonance curve is very close to the unperturbed response , whereas half - integer @xmath85 coincide with highly nonlinear resonant response .",

    "[ fig : resonance ] expected hysteresis loops are smeared and there is very little difference between frequency sweeps up and down . instead , the existence of multistability is proven by making a large number of measurements at the same detuning . to that end",
    ", several hundred trajectories were calculated , and the final resonator amplitude was recorded in each case .",
    "the initial state @xmath140 of the system was given by four random numbers , each uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath141 .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : multistab ] ; the existence of multistability is clearly evident . here",
    ", the detuning @xmath118 was chosen to be one where the theoretical resonance curve indicates that several stable states might occur , see the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : multistab ] .    .",
    "the inset shows a close - up of the relevant region of the analytical resonance curve , where the dashed lines indicate the values of @xmath118 that were examined . for a given detuning and drive power ,",
    "three different amplitudes can be observed . ]      finally , we consider the limit of millikelvin temperatures , such that @xmath142 . with all other parameters as in table  [ tab : params ] , then @xmath143 .",
    "consequently , the frequency shift @xmath104 exhibits incredibly sharp features for @xmath91 such that @xmath144 .",
    "the theoretical resonance curve inherits these sharp features , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : t0 ] .",
    "still , for a large part of the response curve , the calculated response fits the theoretical curve surprisingly well .",
    "the exception is an anomalous region of positive @xmath118 , indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : t0 ] by a dashed box . a typical time evolution of the oscillator coordinate @xmath75 and the flux particle position @xmath16 for detuning @xmath145 are shown in figure  [ fig : trajs ]  ( a ) . as can be seen ,",
    "here in the anomalous part of the response , the system makes quasiperiodic transitions between integer and half - integer values of @xmath16 , leading to beats in the resonator amplitude .",
    "the beats stem from the appearance of transient frequency components at @xmath146 .",
    "these transients appear whenever a transition from integer to half - integer @xmath16 occurs , which causes the resonance to abruptly shift downwards .",
    "while the system remains at half - integer @xmath16 it is strongly nonlinear and can mix frequency components . mixing with the drive at @xmath147 then causes a resultant which is on resonance , that consequently drives the oscillator at a shifted frequency , leading to the amplitude beats .    note",
    "that the corresponding phenomena can not occur for negative detuning @xmath148 . although the opposite process ( half - integer to integer @xmath16 ) will lead to transients with positive frequency components , integer @xmath16 puts the resonator in the completely linear regime .",
    "frequency mixing is then absent , and no component resurrecting the off - resonant motion can appear . instead , only transient switching behavior is seen before the system reaches a stationary oscillatory state @xmath149 .    this anomalous region of deviation between analytical and numerical results is seen also in fig .",
    "[ fig : resonance ] , but only as less well - fitting data points near @xmath145 . in this case , the smoothing of @xmath104 that is caused by the higher temperature makes the dynamics far less dramatic . while driving near @xmath145 will still cause @xmath150 to contain frequency components with negative detuning , thermal noise will smear the resulting amplitude beats , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : trajs ]  ( b ) , thus greatly decreasing the time the system spends in the nonlinear regime and limiting the frequency mixing . the higher noise level thus acts to _ stabilize _ the resonator dynamics .",
    "this hints at the presence of stochastic resonance , in the broad sense of `` randomness that makes a nonlinearity less detrimental to a signal ''  @xcite .",
    "k. the transitions between linear and nonlinear regimes are much sharper than in the case of finite temperatures .",
    "the dashed box indicates the anomalous region of detuning @xmath118 , where analytical and numerical results do not coincide . ]     and the squid flux @xmath16 ( mapped to the interval @xmath139 $ ] ) , at @xmath145 and ( a ) @xmath151  k ( b ) @xmath55  k. the response in the anomalous region is non - stationary , with resonator amplitude beats caused by @xmath16 switching between integer and half - integer values . ]",
    "with superconducting circuit quantum electrodynamics being routinely done in the lab , the proposed system should be readily realized .",
    "although the multistable response will only be visible for a particular range of drive powers , and the nonlinear parts of the resonance peak are very narrow , the current state of the art has matured to the point where detecting both these features is well within reach .",
    "a successful verification of the results in this article would be the first experimental observation of induced nonlinearity in a diffusion - resonator system .",
    "such an observation could stimulate further research into the influence of classical and quantum fluctuations in the interplay between harmonic oscillators and other dynamical systems .",

    "<S> we investigate such an interacting system : a superconducting lc - circuit dispersively coupled to a superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the squid phase behaves as a classical two - level system , whose two states correspond to one linear and one nonlinear regime for the lc - resonator . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the circuit s response to forcing can become multistable . </S>",
    "<S> the strength of the nonlinearity is tuned by the level of noise in the system , and increases with decreasing noise . </S>",
    "<S> this tunable nonlinearity could potentially find application in the field of sensitive detection , whereas increased understanding of the classical harmonic oscillator is relevant for studies of the quantum - to - classical crossover of jaynes - cummings systems .    </S>",
    "<S> the harmonic oscillator is one of the most well - understood dynamical systems in physics , and is used as a model in nearly every field . </S>",
    "<S> the classical harmonic oscillator was studied already by galileo galilei , while its quantum counterpart was described in 1925 by paul dirac . </S>",
    "<S> it remains one of few models that can be exactly solved , and as such , it features prominently in courses on classical and quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> it is perhaps surprising , then , that the harmonic oscillator still remains at the forefront of contemporary physics research .    today </S>",
    "<S> , considerable attention is devoted to harmonic oscillators that interact with an auxiliary dynamical system . </S>",
    "<S> this situation appears , for instance , in circuit quantum electrodynamics  @xcite and quantum information processing  @xcite , where the harmonic oscillator models a superconducting microwave circuit and the auxiliary system is a qubit . </S>",
    "<S> then , manipulation of the circuit allows for control and read - out of the state of the qubit . in a similar manner , </S>",
    "<S> when the auxiliary system is a second harmonic oscillator , as in optomechanics  @xcite , one of the oscillators can be damped or driven by manipulating the other .    </S>",
    "<S> an additional interesting case is when another very common model system takes the role of auxiliary system : the diffusing brownian particle . </S>",
    "<S> one proposed realization of such a coupled system is a diffusing particle loosely adsorbed on the surface of a nanomechanical resonator  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> then , the particle position directly influences the oscillator s natural frequency , and the oscillator in turn provides an amplitude - dependent inertial back - action force on the particle . despite its apparent simplicity , </S>",
    "<S> this diffusion - resonator system exhibits surprising effects such as induced nonlinearity  @xcite and bistability  @xcite , inhomogeneous dephasing  @xcite , as well as mode coupling and non - linear dissipation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as shown recently  @xcite , these features are rather generic for a harmonic oscillator mode coupled dispersively to an auxiliary dynamical system , under certain circumstances . however , with the current state of the art , it is very difficult to fabricate this nanomechanical system in a parameter regime where an interesting physical response will be observable .    here </S>",
    "<S> we propose an alternative realization of a resonator - diffusion system , making use of superconducting circuit elements . </S>",
    "<S> these allow for a high degree of control over the relevant parameters , some of which can be tuned in situ . </S>",
    "<S> our proposed realization , depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : system ] , makes use of a resistively shunted superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) , whose phase variable will act as a diffusing particle , due to the presence of noise in the shunting resistor . </S>",
    "<S> the harmonic oscillator is represented by a lumped superconducting lc - resonator , and is inductively coupled to the squid . </S>",
    "<S> we find that when the resonator is driven , the squid phase locks in to one of two values ; it behaves as a classical two - level system . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the lc - circuit exhibits dramatically different dynamics for the two values of the phase . in one case </S>",
    "<S> the circuit becomes a linear oscillator , while in the other it is highly nonlinear and can be multistable . </S>",
    "<S> as the resonator amplitude increases , the system switches between linear and non - linear regimes in a quasi - periodic manner , determined by the noise level and the drive amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> we derive an analytical model that is very successful at predicting the two regimes , and discuss where this model breaks down .    while it is clear that the tunable nonlinearity found in the studied circuit could find application in the field of sensitive detection ( c.f . </S>",
    "<S> josephson bifurcation amplifiers  @xcite ) , our results also have more fundamental implications . in the quantum regime , a two - level system coupled to a harmonic oscillator is described by the well - studied jaynes - cummings hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> however , an understanding of the transition between this quantum regime and its classical counterpart remains elusive . </S>",
    "<S> as we here investigate the _ classical _ dynamics of a harmonic oscillator coupled to a two - level system , new light is shed on the less - known half of this quantum - to - classical crossover .    . </S>",
    "<S> for read - out and actuation , the lc - resonator can be coupled inductively or capacitively to an external transmission line . </S>",
