    "formulation and solution of inverse problems is an increasingly important field of scientific research .",
    "however , compared with a well - posed ( in hadamard s sense ) direct or forward problem , the corresponding inverse problem is much more difficult and , as a rule , ill - posed .",
    "inverse scattering problem can be considered an exception to this rule .",
    "namely , in the simplest one - dimensional case , the inverse scattering theory provides strict mathematical criteria for the existence , uniqueness and stability of the solution .",
    "it means that in this particular case the inverse problem is well - posed as well .",
    "the related forward problem is the solution of the simplest time - independent schrdinger equation@xmath0for a given potential @xmath1 , and subjected to appropriate physical boundary conditions .",
    "( [ v1 ] ) can be easily solved numerically and thus , in principle , all spectral characteristics of the potential @xmath1 can be accurately ascertained .    the inverse problem is to determine the * unknown * potential starting from the known spectral characteristics .",
    "this is a serious task even in this simple case for the following reasons :    * it is not obvious what kind of input information is actually needed to solve the problem uniquely .",
    "* there must be a theoretical basis ( a fundamental equation ) which enables to solve the problem .",
    "* apart from the theoretical difficulties , another important question arises : how to obtain the necessary input data ? * even if the mentioned principal barriers could be overcome , the computational - technical solution of the problem is not at all trivial .",
    "issues 1 and 2 have been successfully resolved in early 1950s for the class of potentials on the half line : @xmath2 .",
    "the necessary and sufficient conditions for the unique solution of the inverse problem have been formulated in a series of outstanding theoretical works by marchenko @xcite , gelfand , levitan @xcite , krein @xcite and others ( see , e.g. , @xcite , section iii.7 for a brief overview ) .",
    "in addition , three different methods to solve the problem have been worked out , based on the integral equations by gelfand - levitan @xcite , marchenko @xcite and krein @xcite .",
    "solution of the inverse scattering problem on the full line ( @xmath3 ) is a more challenging problem , which was first addressed by kay @xcite , moses @xcite , and few years later in a series of papers by faddeev @xcite .",
    "these fundamental studies provide full description of the solution procedure , while the correct necessary and sufficient criteria for the uniqueness of the solution were given by marchenko ( see @xcite , section iii.5 ) .",
    "these criteria apply to the following pair of integral equations @xcite:@xmath4@xmath5which are formally very similar to the marchenko equation on the half line ( see @xcite , p. 218 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "their operator - theoretical content is closer to the gelfand - levitan approach .",
    "therefore , as a kind of compromise , eqs .",
    "( [ v2])-([v3 ] ) are often called gelfand - levitan - marchenko ( glm )  equations .",
    "the kernel @xmath6 in eq .",
    "( v2 ) ( where @xmath7 )  is completely specified by the so - called right scattering data , while the kernel @xmath8 in eq .",
    "( [ v3 ] ) ( @xmath9 ) is determined by the left scattering data .",
    "these two sets of input data are equivalent : the left data are uniquely determined by the right ones and _ vice versa_. in the following analysis we will rely on eq . ( [ v2 ] ) . if one is able to solve this integral equation then the potential is given by@xmath10    now , let us briefly discuss point 3 in the above list .",
    "unfortunately , the criteria for the uniqueness of the solution are so strict that it is nearly impossible to get all the necessary input data experimentally . however ,",
    "if one sets an additional constraint that the resulting potential must be reflectionless then the inverse scattering problem can be solved much more easily . moreover , a * symmetric * reflectionless potential is uniquely determined if its full spectrum of bound states is known . in the following analysis",
    "it is assumed that the potential @xmath1 that corresponds to eq .",
    "( [ v4 ] ) is reflectionless by definition .",
    "as the general principles of building confining reflectionless potentials are long known @xcite , a natural question arises : is there any need to revisit the topic ?",
    "a motivation comes from point 4 stated above : if the total number of bound states is large then the technical side of the procedure becomes important .",
    "this in turn motivates development of more efficient algorithms . in this paper , a new analytic algorithm",
    "is derived , which enables to easily calculate a reflectionless potential with an arbitrary number ( @xmath11 ) of bound states .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the general principles are briefly described , which form the overall basis for the approach .  secs .",
