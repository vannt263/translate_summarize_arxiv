    "over the past decade , coherence - domain imaging ( cdi ) , particularly optical coherence tomography ( oct ) , has come into its own .",
    "oct relies on the interference of partially coherent light to achieve axial sectioning @xcite .",
    "the technique has been highly successful , particularly in biology and medicine @xcite . indeed , in recent years",
    ", oct has joined the armamentarium of diagnostic imaging techniques , and has found use in clinical ophthalmology @xcite , dermatology @xcite , cardiology @xcite , and gastroenterology @xcite . in biological tissue , oct typically achieves an axial resolution of a few @xmath0 m and achieves imaging to depths of 23  mm @xcite .",
    "the central wavelength at which a biological cdi system operates is an important parameter ; optical scattering in biological tissue makes it difficult to image deeply in the visible region so that most cdi systems make use of light sources with wavelengths longer than 700 nm .",
    "the limitation on the long - wavelength side is governed by the absorption of water , which becomes substantial at about 1500 nm . moreover , since the axial resolution of a cdi system improves as the spectral bandwidth of the light source increases , use of the entire wavelength range from 700 to 1500 nm provides a suitable combination of deep penetration and ultra - high resolution for biological tissue @xcite .    in this paper , we demonstrate that coherence - domain imaging may be achieved at a low photon - flux level by making use of light generated by spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) in a chirped periodically poled stoichiometric lithium tantalate ( chirped - ppslt ) structure , via phase matching to the fundamental .",
    "this structure is pumped with 532-nm cw light from a high - power laser to generate broadband light centered at 1064 nm .",
    "broadband spdc has been generated previously in chirped periodically poled structures , but only in the 800-nm region and only via phase matching to the third harmonic , which is less efficient @xcite .",
    "we have built on our previous efforts @xcite in carrying out photon - counting optical coherence - domain reflectometry with superconducting single - photon detectors ( sspds ) , which are sensitive over the entire spectral range of interest for biological imaging , namely 7001500 nm .    section  ii summarizes the theory of the spdc optical source , along with optical spectra calculated for parameter ranges of interest .",

    "in particular , we display cdi interferograms for a hierarchy of samples of increasing complexity : a mirror , a pellicle , and a biological sample comprising onion - skin tissue . in the discussion provided in sec .",

    "the generic interferometric arrangement for the experiments we report in this section is schematized in fig .",
    "the experiments were carried out using either single - mode - fiber - coupled downconversion or single - mode - fiber - coupled light from a superluminescent diode ( sld ) .",
    "the broadband light emanating from the source was coupled into a single - mode ( sm ) fiber and collimated by lens l3 before being fed into the michelson interferometer .",
    "the light in the interferometer was focused onto the reference mirror and the sample using lenses l4 and l5 , respectively . lens l4 and the reference mirror were placed on a single nanopositioning stage while the sample was placed on another one .",
    "their positions were changed in accordance with the arrows shown in the figure .",
    "the light exiting the interferometer was fed into either a single - photon avalanche detector ( spad ) or a sspd via fiber - coupling and a lens ( not shown ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the optical components should be transmissive over a broad band of wavelengths when working with broadband optical imaging systems .",
    "the downconversion source , shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) , consisted of light from a cw frequency - doubled nd@xmath43:yvo@xmath44 laser ( coherent verdi ) , operating at a wavelength of 532 nm and at a power of 2 w , that pumped a chirped - ppslt device with three separate structures fabricated on the same substrate , as described previously .",
    "the structure was aligned to obtain collinear spdc .",
    "the downconverted light was collimated using a lens ( l1 ) and coupled into a sm fiber via another lens ( l2 ) .",
    "the filter , comprising a dichroic mirror and a longpass filter , served to remove the pump and to allow only the downconverted light to be coupled into the fiber .",
    "the light from the sld ( superlum sld-47-mp ) was centered at a wavelength of 930 nm and had a full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) spectral width of 70 nm .",
    "optical imaging systems often make use of commercially available si or ingaas semiconductor detectors , depending on the wavelength at which the system operates . roughly speaking , si photodiodes",
    "are used for wavelengths shorter than 1100 nm and operate best in the vicinity of 800 nm , whereas ingaas photodiodes , which are designed for operation in the vicinity of 1300 nm , are used for wavelengths longer than 1100 nm .",
    "the si spads used in our experiments are incorporated in commercially available single - photon counting modules ( perkin - elmer , model spcm - aqr-15-fc ) .",
    "inasmuch as neither si nor ingaas are sensitive over the entire spectral range of 7001500 nm , however , we have followed our previous work and assayed the use of sspds in photon - counting optical coherence - domain imaging @xcite .",
    "such detectors offer some benefits for single - photon - counting applications , especially in the infrared , since they exhibit low dark - count rates and operate in a spectral region that stretches from 0.4 to 6 @xmath0 m @xcite , which includes the region of biological interest .",
    "the sspds used were fabricated from 4-nm - thick superconducting niobium nitride ( nbn ) films @xcite ; their operation has been described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the quantum efficiency monotonically decreases with increasing wavelength of the incident light .",
    "measurements using sspds were carried out in the same way as those described previously @xcite .      in this set of experiments , we measured the spectra associated with the downconverted light emitted by the three different chirped - ppslt structures , as a function of temperature .",
    "the parameters for these structures were provided in sec .  [",
    "sec : simspect ] , where the calculated spectra were reported ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the experiments were carried out using the setup displayed in fig .  2 , which makes use of sm - fiber - coupled downconversion as the source , a sspd as the detector , and a mirror as the sample .",
    "the counts from the sspd were measured in a fixed time window , as a function of the reference - arm displacement ( position of the reference mirror ) .",
    "the resultant interferograms were fourier - transformed to obtain an estimate of the power spectral density of the downconverted light from the structures at different temperatures .",
    "the experimental results are displayed as brightness images for the unchirped , medium - chirped , and maximum - chirped structures in figs .",
    "3(a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) , respectively .",
    "the observed normalized spectrum is displayed in fig .",
    "3(d ) for the maximum - chirped structure at a temperature of 80@xmath42 c.    the spectral content of downconversion from the three chirped - ppslt structures , which are stable and predictable , roughly follow the calculated patterns ( see fig",
    ".  1 ) . for the unchirped structure ,",
    "the phase matching is satisfied for two narrow bands of wavelengths .",
    "the widths of these bands increase for the medium - chirped structure , and a broad wavelength band emerges for the maximum - chirped structure .",
    "the spectra obtained for the unchirped and medium - chirped structures are slightly broader than those predicted by the calculations .",
    "we attribute this to the presence of the collimating lens ( l1 ) , which collects the downconverted beams over a finite angular range , rather than collinearly . also , the measured optical power at longer wavelengths is smaller than that expected on the basis of the calculations .",
    "we believe that this arises because of a reduction in the quantum efficiency of the sspd , as well as changes in the transmittance of the optical components , as the wavelength increases .",
    "these results illustrate that we have a sound understanding of the features of spdc light generation via chirped - ppslt structures , thereby allowing us to engineer broadband spectra as desired .",
    "we next carried out a set of experiments to determine the relative merits of using different sources of light and different detectors for coherence - domain imaging .",
    "after examining the axial resolution achievable by using broadband spdc ( from the structure with the greatest chirp at a temperature of 80@xmath42 c ; see sec .  [ ssec : obsspect ] ) in conjunction with a sspd , we demonstrate that the resolution is diminished when the sspd is replaced by a spad .",
    "we then proceed to show that the resolution is further diminished when the downconversion source is replaced by a sld .",
    "the axial resolution is determined by examining the widths of the interferogram envelopes using a mirror as the sample , as well as by making use of a pellicle as the sample .    in the first set of experiments to measure the axial resolution",
    ", we used a mirror as the sample in the experimental arrangement depicted in fig .",
    "we constructed interferograms by measuring the counts from the detector in a fixed time window , as a function of the position of the reference mirror ( see sec .",
    "[ ssec : obsspect ] ) , using the three source / detector combinations indicated above .",
    "the results are illustrated in fig .",
    "they reveal that the fwhm of the interferogram envelopes increase from 1.6 to 2.8 to 6.3 @xmath0 m for the spdc / sspd , spdc / spad , and sld / sspd combinations , respectively .",
    "since the narrower the width of the envelope , the better the resolution , this demonstrates that the downconverted light with a superconducting detector yielded the highest resolution of the three source / detector combinations considered .    another way of measuring the resolving power of an optical system is to test its ability to distinguish reflections from two nearby surfaces .",
    "the second set of experiments was similar to the first set , as described above , except that we replaced the mirror by a pellicle in the experimental arrangement depicted in fig .",
    "the pellicle was a nitrocellulose membrane ( thorlabs ) of refractive index @xmath45 and thickness @xmath46 m .",
    "again we constructed interferograms using the three source / detector combinations indicated above .",
    "the results are illustrated in fig .",
    "it is evident that only the combination of a broadband downconversion source and a superconducting detector ( fig .",
    "5(a ) ) was capable of clearly resolving the two surfaces of the membrane , indicating that this combination offered the highest resolution .",
    "the measured optical path length between the reflections is seen to be 3 @xmath0 m in fig .",
    "5(a ) ; this corresponds to a physical distance of @xmath47 m , which nicely matches the thickness of the pellicle .    in terms of resolution , then , these experiments lead us to conclude that , in the vicinity of 1064 nm and of the source / detector combinations we examined , the optimal combination for coherence - domain imaging comprises broadband downconverted light with a superconducting detector .",
    "finally , we demonstrated the photon - counting coherence - domain imaging of a biological sample , comparing the performance of two source / detector combinations .",
    "the sample was an onion - skin tissue from a white onion that was adhered to a cover slip using a small drop of water .",
    "the sample was placed in the generic experimental setup depicted in fig .  2 and a collection of a - scans were obtained at different transverse ( @xmath48 ) positions along the sample . at a given transverse position ,",
    "the lens  mirror combination ( l4 and reference mirror ) was scanned in the @xmath7 direction over a range of 70 @xmath49 , using a step size of 100 nm , and counts were recorded at each step for a 500-ms accumulation time .",
    "the duration of an a - scan was thus 350 sec .",
    "the sample was then moved to the next transverse position , with a step size of 5 @xmath49 in the @xmath48 direction , and the next a - scan was recorded .",
    "the step size was chosen to be 5 @xmath49 since the transverse resolution of the imaging system was estimated to be @xmath50 , based on a collimated beam width of @xmath51 , a focal length of @xmath52 for lens l5 , and the central wavelength of @xmath53 .",
    "the sample was scanned in the @xmath48 direction over a range of 800 @xmath49 , so that 160 scans were collected in the axial direction .",
    "the limited photon flux available from the downconversion source and the limited quantum efficiency ( 512% ) of the particular sspds that we used in these experiments @xcite result in long acquisition times . these can be decreased , however , by making use of a more powerful laser pump , a chirped spdc structure with higher conversion efficiency , optics that is optimized over a broad wavelength band , and a detector with higher quantum efficiency .",
    "the collected a - scans were used to construct an @xmath54 b - scan of the onion - skin sample using broadband spdc ( from the structure with the greatest chirp at a temperature of 80@xmath42 c ; see sec .",
    "[ ssec : obsspect ] ) in conjunction with a sspd .",
    "the results are illustrated in fig .",
    "the two surfaces of several onion - skin cells are apparent ( the size of an individual cell falls in the range of onion - skin cells observed using other imaging modalities ; see , for example , figs .",
    "2(c ) , 4 , and 6 of ref .",
    "we also constructed a b - scan of the same sample with the spdc source replaced by a standard sld ( see sec .",
    "[ ssec : obsspect ] ) , again using the sspd .",
    "the results are displayed in fig .",
    "it is apparent that the resolution is diminished when the spdc source is replaced by a sld , by virtue of the narrower bandwidth of the latter .",
    "these results confirm once again that , in the vicinity of 1064 nm , and of the source / detector combinations examined , the best resolution was obtained by using broadband downconverted light and a superconducting detector .",
    "coherence - domain imaging systems can be operated in a single - photon counting mode , offering low detector noise ; this in turn leads to increased sensitivity for weak light sources and weakly reflecting samples @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we have demonstrated that excellent axial resolution can be obtained in a photon - counting coherence - domain imaging system that uses light generated via spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) in a chirped periodically poled stoichiometric lithium tantalate ( chirped - ppslt ) structure , in conjunction with a niobium nitride superconducting single - photon detector ( sspd ) .",
    "the bandwidth of the light generated via spdc , as well as the bandwidth over which the sspd is sensitive , can extend over a wavelength region that stretches from 700 to 1500 nm .",
    "this ultra - broad wavelength band offers a near - ideal combination of deep penetration and ultra - high axial resolution for the imaging of biological tissue .",
    "the generation of spdc light of adjustable bandwidth in the vicinity of 1064 nm , via the use of chirped - ppslt structures , has not been achieved previously . unlike many other broadband sources , the spectra are stable and predictable .",
    "we also showed that the observed spectral characteristics of this source accord well with those calculated based on a second - order nonlinear - optics model , indicating that we have the capability of engineering broadband near - infrared sources as desired .",
    "there are a number of limitations associated with this system , however : ( 1 ) the spdc source is more complex and expensive than commonly used slds ; ( 2 ) spdc generates substantially lower optical photon flux than other commonly used broadband sources , such as slds , fsec lasers , fiber lasers @xcite , and supercontinuum sources generated by photonic - crystal fibers @xcite , resulting in long data - acquisition times ; and ( 3 ) the use of sspds is complicated by their small active areas and low quantum efficiencies , as well as by the need for cryogenic operation .",
    "nevertheless , in the vicinity of 1064 nm , we have explicitly demonstrated that the axial resolution offered by the spdc / sspd source / detector combination exceeds that achievable with either a superluminescent diode ( sld ) as the source , or a single - photon avalanche detector ( spad ) as the detector .",
    "these findings were confirmed by the coherence - domain imaging of a hierarchy of samples of increasing complexity : a mirror , a nitrocellulose membrane , and a biological sample comprising onion - skin cells .",
