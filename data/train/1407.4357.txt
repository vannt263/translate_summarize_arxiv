    "the experiments with solar , atmospheric , reactor and accelerator neutrinos in recent decades  @xcite have provided compelling evidences for the neutrino oscillation . in the three - generation neutrino framework , the neutrino oscillation is caused by the nonzero neutrino masses due to the mixing among the mass eigenstates in the flavour eigenstates .",
    "there have been a number of new measurements on the neutrino mass splitting recently  @xcite .",
    "however , the absolute mass scale of neutrinos is still unclear yet .",
    "it is also not clarified whether neutrinos are dirac or majorana fermions .",
    "fortunately , the neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath0 ) process provides us some extra information on neutrino properties .",
    "the double beta decay of eleven nuclei , whose q - values are larger than 2  mev such as @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath1 , have been studied up to date  @xcite . for almost all the eleven isotopes , the two - neutrino double beta decay ( @xmath6 ) processes @xmath7 are observed . the @xmath0 process @xmath8",
    "if occurs , can serve as signals of new physics such as the total lepton number violation and the majorana nature of neutrinos .",
    "the only observation of decay events was reported in the year of 2001 by the heidelberg - moscow experiment  @xcite , which claimed the half - life time @xmath9 on @xmath2 at @xmath10 .",
    "but the data from the germanium detector array ( gerda ) experiment  @xcite in 2013 indicate that the half - life time of @xmath2 should be no lower than @xmath11 yr ( 90% cl ) , with the heidelberg - moscow result unconfirmed .",
    "recently , the enriched xenon observatory ( exo-200 ) collaboration  @xcite and the kamioka liquid scintillator anti - neutrino detector - zero neutrino double beta ( kamland - zen ) collabaration  @xcite released their new results from which we can obtain the strongest constraint on neutrino majorana mass .",
    "the lower limits on @xmath0 half time of several isotopes reported by recent experiments are listed in table  [ tab:1 ] .",
    "we can only obtain the effective majorana neutrino mass from the half - life time of @xmath0 process . in order to get constraints of each mass eigenstates and flavour eigenstates",
    ", it is necessary to combine the data of double beta decay experiments and oscillation experiments , since the oscillation provides us two mass square differences , as well as the mixing angles @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and the cp phase @xmath15 in the pontecorvo - maki - nakawaga - sakata  ( pmns ) mixing matrix  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we provide new constraints on absolute neutrino majorana mass from analysis of the latest data of @xmath0 processes , combined with also new results of neutrino mixing parameters . in sec .",
    "ii , we obtain the upper limits of the effective majorana neutrino mass . then we calculate the mass constraints of different eigenstates by using the cp phase as a variable in sec .",
    "iii and sec .",
    "iv . in sec .",
    "v , we present the conclusion and some discussions on some possible relations among neutrino masses .",
    "the half - life time of @xmath16 process is determined by three kinds of contributions , i.e. , the particle mass factor , the phase space integral factor @xmath17 and the nuclear matrix element  ( nme ) @xmath18 .",
    "both the latter two vary with different isotopes .",
    "if only considering the contribution of the light majorana neutrino , the half - life time of a given isotope @xmath19 is written as  @xcite @xmath20^{-1}=\\left(\\frac{m^{0\\nu}_{\\beta\\beta}}{m_e}\\right)^2g_{01}(q_{\\beta\\beta } , z)|\\mathcal{m}_{0\\nu}(a)|^2 , \\label{half - life}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the rest mass of electron . here",
    "we introduce the effective majorana neutrino mass @xmath22 to represent the contribution of the majorana neutrino during the decay process . @xmath23",

    "however , the nmes are more complicated and we can only obtain them by approximation methods .",
    "there are several common approaches , e.g. , the interacting shell model  ( ism )  @xcite , energy density functional  ( edf ) method  @xcite , interacting boson model ( ibm )  @xcite , quasiparticle random phase approximation  ( qrpa )  @xcite , self - consistent renormalized quasiparticle random phase approximation  ( srqrpa )  @xcite and the skyrme hartree - fock - bogoliubov quasiparticle random phase approximation  ( skm - hfb - qrpa )  @xcite .",
    "the nmes from some of these methods together with the phase space factors are listed in table  [ tab:2 ] .    according to eq .",
    "( [ half - life ] ) , we can obtain the expression of the effective majorana neutrino mass with the half - life time as known quantity , @xmath39 the results of the constrains on @xmath40 from different experiments are showed in table  [ tab:3 ] . comparing with the half - life time data in table  [ tab:1 ] , we find that the exo-200 and kamland - zen experiments provide the strongest constraint on the effective majorana neutrino mass @xmath41 based on the @xmath42 data and edf approximation approach .",
    "it is necessary to notice that though the gerda group reports a strong lower limit of the @xmath0 decay half - life time , it does not provide the strongest constraint on majorana neutrino mass  @xcite , since the phase space integral factor of @xmath42 is much larger than that of @xmath2 .",

    "here we use the global fitting results  @xcite of mixing parameters listed in table  [ tab:4 ] as the inputs .",
    "the latest t2k result  @xcite suggests the negative maximal violation of cp phase @xmath46 or @xmath47 , which agrees with the prediction of the maximal cp violation ( @xmath48 ) from the @xmath49-@xmath50 interchange symmetry  @xcite . in our calculation",
    ", we take the cp phase @xmath15 as a parameter too . since there is little information about the majorana cp phases",
    ", we hypothesize that @xmath51 .",
    "thus , we have only three mass eigenvalues as unknown quantities in the three independent equations below , @xmath52 then we draw the curves that show how the upper limits of neutrino mass eigenvalues @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath53 change with the cp phase @xmath15 , as seen from fig .  [ fig:1 ] .    in the figure we can find that these three functions @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) are all trigonometric functions with the same phase .",
    "the period of the @xmath54 is not @xmath56 but @xmath57 .",
    "the @xmath57 period is resulted from the fact that the @xmath15 appears as @xmath58 form in eq .",
    "( [ effective mass lim . ] ) .",
    "if @xmath15 satisfies the maximal cp violation assumption , namely @xmath59 , the sign of @xmath15 has no influence for constraining the neutrino majorana mass in this way , for the range of @xmath60 is just the right period of one @xmath57 .",
    "the first two mass eigenvalues @xmath44 and @xmath45 are very close to each other .",
    "the third one has a larger difference with respect to them , but the distinction is still within 10  mev .",
    "the error bars in the figure reflect the @xmath43 range influences of the mixing parameters .",
    "this error range almost covers the difference between @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "this indicates that the three mass eigenstates @xmath61 ( @xmath55 ) are degenerate : @xmath62 and @xmath63 are strongly degenerate , and @xmath64 is a little bit weaker .",
    "that helps us to understand why the mixing angle between @xmath62 and @xmath63 is large . on the other hand ,",
    "since the level of error is related to @xmath40 , it is necessary to improve the observation on @xmath0 process , for getting stronger mass upper limits or even exactly events to enrich the knowledge of the neutrino mass eigenvalues .    *",
    "_ flavour eigenstates _ *  in the three - generation neutrino framework , there are three mass eigenstates that evolute with the time and three flavour eigenstates that take part in the weak interaction . equipped with the upper limits of each mass eigenvalue from the effective majorana neutrino mass , many calculations become feasible .",
    "it is the flavour eigenstate mass constraints that interest us most since they have the direct correlation to the dynamic processes .",
    "we introduce the mass operator @xmath65 that satisfies the relation @xmath66 where @xmath37 for the mass eigenstates . from eq .",
    "( [ mixing ] ) , the masses of flavour eigenstates , i.e. , @xmath67 ( @xmath68 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) , are written as @xmath69     as an independent variable , with @xmath70 ( @xmath24 ) denoting the mass upper limits .",
    "the upper figure ( a ) corresponds to the normal hierarchy , and the figure ( b ) for inverted hierarchy . ]     as an independent variable , with @xmath70 ( @xmath24 ) denoting the mass upper limits .",
    "the upper figure ( a ) corresponds to the normal hierarchy , and the figure ( b ) for inverted hierarchy . ]",

    "the @xmath70-@xmath15 relations are also trigonometric - like functions .",
    "its frequency is the same as the mass eigenstate .",
    "it is easy to understand since @xmath72 ( @xmath55 ) are trigonometric functions of @xmath15 , and the coefficients of @xmath73 terms in eqs .",
    "( [ flavour eigenstates2 ] ) and ( [ flavour eigenstates3 ] ) cancel each other due to the facts that @xmath74 and that @xmath75 .",
    "2 .   in the nh condition",
    ", the mass upper limits of flavour eigenstate masses have the hierarchy @xmath76 but in the ih condition , the hierarchy changes into @xmath77 since @xmath53 is the largest ( or smallest ) one in the nh ( or ih ) case , eqs .",
    "( [ hierarchy1 ] ) and ( [ hierarchy2 ] ) indicate that the dependence on @xmath53 becomes lager when the generation number increases .",
    "we define the differences between mass upper limits of flavour eigenstates as @xmath78 the absolute values of these two differences are the same in the normal hierarchy case and inverted hierarchy case , i.e. , @xmath79 and @xmath21 is almost the same in the two cases .    from @xmath0 processes",
    "we obtain the upper limit for the summed neutrino mass @xmath80 which is comparable with the bound 0.23  ev obtained from cosmological observations  @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , by analysing the latest results of @xmath0 processes from various isotopes , we give a new constraint of the effective majorana neutrino mass in @xmath81 with the exo-200 and kamland - zen data  @xcite .",
    "the strongest mass upper limit of @xmath40 ranges from 0.115 to 0.339  ev depending on the different approximation methods when calculating nuclear matrix elements .",
    "further more , combining with the global fitting results of neutrino mixing parameters , we calculate the upper mass limits of three mass eigenstates @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and three flavour eigenstates @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the mass eigenvalue upper limits are very close to each other , and are periodic with period @xmath57 .",
    "there are some hierarchal and invariant relations which might indicate inner relations among the flavour eigenstates .",
    "the studies on the nature of neutrinos are beneficial to explore new physics .",
    "the @xmath0 decay process is important to explore whether the neutrinos are majorana fermions or dirac fermions , and it is also very useful to provide the limits of their absolute mass scales , as reflected from our analysis .",
    "such kind of experiments can provide more strong constraints on the effective majorana neutrino mass in the future , and they can also clarify possible relations among mass eigenstates and flavour eigenstates of neutrinos .",
