    "a reaction that can be used to study the influence of qcd dynamics at nucleonic length scales is semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering off the deuteron ( @xmath5 ) , where a spectator proton is detected in the final state . at very low",
    "spectator momenta the neutron is nearly on - shell and the reaction can be used to extract information about the `` _ _ free _ _ '' neutron structure function in a way that minimizes the nuclear binding effects inherent in scattering off a deuteron target . at higher spectator",

    "two recent jefferson lab hall b experiments have studied the reaction : one at high @xcite , and the other at low spectator momenta @xcite .    in order to provide meaningful interpretations of the measured data , theoretical models that quantify the importance of the fsi in the reaction",
    "are needed .",
    "the major difficulty in doing this is that one lacks detailed information about the composition and space - time evolution of the hadronic system produced in the deep inelastic scattering and how this changes as a function of bjorken @xmath4 and @xmath1 .",
    "several theoretical approaches that provide models for the @xmath5 reaction can be found in the literature @xcite . in the following , we will present work in a model based on the general properties of soft rescattering @xcite .",
    "results are compared to data taken in the jlab deeps experiment and we use these results and data to describe a method to extract the neutron structure at high @xmath4 .",
    "the interaction of the virtual photon with the bound nucleon is treated with the _ virtual nucleon approximation _ ( vna ) @xcite . in the vna",
    ", the spectator nucleon is taken on the mass shell , while the virtual photon interacts with an off - shell nucleon .",
    "the vna is based on the following main assumptions : ( i ) only the @xmath6 component of the deuteron wave function is considered in the reaction , ( ii ) the negative energy projection of the virtual nucleon propagator gives negligible contribution to the scattering amplitude , and ( iii ) interactions of the virtual photon with exchanged mesons is neglected .",
    "assumptions ( i ) and ( ii ) can be satisfied when the momentum of the spectator proton is limited to @xmath7 mev / c @xcite , while ( iii ) is satisfied at large @xmath1 ( @xmath8 gev@xmath9 ) @xcite .",
    "the nuclear wave function in the vna is normalized to account for the baryon number conservation @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the light cone momentum fraction of the deuteron carried by the bound nucleon normalized in such a way that the half of the deuteron momentum fraction corresponds to @xmath12 . because of the virtuality of interacting nucleon it is impossible to satisfy the momentum sum rule at the same time , which can be qualitatively interpreted as part of the deuteron momentum fraction being distributed to non - nucleonic degrees of freedom .    in the model ,",
    "two feynman diagrams are taken into account : the plane - wave diagram where the on - shell proton is a pure spectator and the fsi diagram where a soft rescattering occurs between the produced @xmath2 and the spectator . to describe the fsi of the produced @xmath2 with the spectator nucleon , the",
    "_ generalized eikonal approximation _ is applied . at the energies under consideration in the jlab experiments",

    "the following eikonal form is adopted for the @xmath13 rescattering amplitude : @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the effective total cross section , real part and the slope factor of the diffractive @xmath18 scattering amplitude . in the derivation of the fsi amplitude ,",
    "a factorized approach is used , whereby the interaction of the virtual photon with the off - shell nucleon is taken out of the integration over the intermediate spectator momentum .",
    "such an approximation is also applied in quasi - elastic scattering @xcite , being valid up to spectator momenta around 400 mev / c .",

    "here , we imposed an extra constraint on the quadratic fit , that the @xmath71 value of its minimum has to coincide with the minimum of the fsi curve along the trajectory .",
    "the position of this minimum is related to the size of the fsi term in the distorted spectral function which the model does a good of describing for the kinematics along this trajectory .",
