    "the underlying theory of quantum state transformation has been developed recently @xcite .",
    "it is based on a quantization procedure for the electromagnetic field in dispersing and absorbing inhomogeneous dielectrics @xcite , which is consistent with both the dissipation - fluctuation theorem and the qed canonical ( equal - time ) commutation relations .",
    "one interesting aspect of the theory is that given the complex refractive - index profiles @xcite of the devices , which can be determined experimentally , the parameters relevant to the quantum - state transformation can be calculated without further assumptions .    in section [ se2 ]",
    "the basic relations for describing the pulse propagation and the associated quantum - state transformation are given for the case when the pulses are initially prepared in a two - mode squeezed vacuum state .",

    "since in this case the photon number must be large , the state should tend to a macroscopic ( at least mesoscopic ) state , and hence its nonclassical features can become extremely unstable . clearly , in the case of discrete - variable systems the entanglement must not necessarily increase with the mean photon number .",

    "correlation measures can be defined employing the von neumann entropy .",
    "a very general correlation measure is the index of correlation @xcite @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the entropy of the two - pulse system , and @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) are the entropies of the single - pulse systems , @xmath85 note that @xmath86 is bounded from below by @xmath87 and from above by .",
    "further , @xmath86 is an upper bound of the entanglement , @xmath88 , because @xmath89 is an element of the set of separable states @xmath45 of the two - pulse system .",
    "correlation measures that can be used to formulate criteria of nonclassical correlation are @xcite @xmath90 ( @xmath84 ) . since the entropy of a classical system must not be less than the entropy of one of its subsystems , positive values of @xmath91 indicate nonclassical correlation .",
    "thus , positive values of @xmath92 and/or @xmath93 may be regarded as indicating entanglement .    as can be seen from equation ( [ 2.19 ] ) , the characteristic function of @xmath94 is of gaussian type .",
    "the same is true for the characteristic function of @xmath95 and @xmath96 , which follows from equation ( [ 2.19 ] ) for @xmath97 and @xmath98 respectively .",
    "hence , the entropies @xmath99 , equation ( [ 3.07 ] ) , and [ after diagonalizing the quadratic form in the exponent in equation ( [ 2.19 ] ) ] the entropy @xmath100 , equation ( [ 3.08 ] ) , can be obtained analytically in the form of the entropy of thermal states : @xmath101 @xmath102 @xmath103 equations ( [ 3.14 ] )  ( [ 3.16 ] ) again reveal the typical dependence on the spectral overlaps of the transmitted and the incoming pulses , the overlaps being substantially determined by the frequency response of the devices .",

    "whereas @xmath92 referring to the noise channel becomes negative and thus attains classically allowed values , @xmath108 referring to the unperturbed channel remains always positive but becomes small .",
    "the results are in agreement with the peres - horodecki separability criterion for bipartite gaussian quantum states @xcite .",

    "the values of @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and @xmath106 , @xmath109 depend on the chosen pulse forms and on the dependence on frequency of the transmission coefficients of the devices @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "when the bandwidths of the pulses are sufficiently small , so that the variation of @xmath64 and @xmath65 within the pulse bandwidths can be disregarded , then @xmath64 and @xmath65 can be taken at the mid - frequencies @xmath113 and @xmath114 of the pulse , i.e. , @xmath115 and @xmath116 . in this case , the results become independent of the pulse shape and solely reflect the effect of the devices .",

    "we have studied the problem of quantum correlations in a system of two entangled optical pulses of arbitrary shape , propagating through dispersing and obsorbing four - port devices , which may serve as models of beam splitters , fibres , interferometers etc . given the complex refractive - index profiles of the devices , which can be determined experimentally , the relevant parameters for the pulse propagation and the associated quantum - state transformation can be calculated without further assumptions .",
    "the devices can be viewed as realizations of noisy channels for quantum information transmission .    in the calculations we have assumed that the pulses are initially prepared in a two - mode squeezed vacuum , which is typically considered in quantum teleportation of continuous - variable systems .",
    "we have calculated various correlation measures and studied their dependence on the pulse shape and mid - frequency , the frequency response of the devices , and the initial mean photon number .",
    "in particular , the results suggest that nonclassical correlations rapidly decrease with increasing mean photon number , which may drastically limit the effectively realizable non - classical correlation in continuous - variable systems . as a realization of a four - port device",
    ", we have considered a dielectric plate of a lorentz - type complex permittivity in more detail .",
    "finally , it should be remembered that the fidelity and the correlation indices are not strict entanglement measures .",
    "nevertheless , they may be helpful to find characteristic dependences and to estimate limits of entanglement transmission .",
    "whereas for low - dimensional discrete - variable systems such as qubits numerical methods can be used to calculate the entanglement degradation exactly , the exploding effort prevents one from applying them to continuous - variable systems such as strongly squeezed two - mode vacuum states .",
