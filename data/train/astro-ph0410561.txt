    "type i x - ray bursts were discovered independently by @xcite and @xcite and occur in matter - transfering binary systems in which a neutron star accretes hydrogen and helium from an unevolved companion star @xcite .",
    "the transferred matter is heated to @xmath2 k while it slowly descends into the neutron star atmosphere as freshly infalling material continuously piles on top of it . at these temperatures hydrogen burns stably into helium at a constant and temperature - independent rate given by the half lives of two nuclei participating in the @xmath3-limited hcno cycle @xcite .",
    "@xmath4 where the decay constants @xmath5 are given by the half lives of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the total mass fraction of these two nuclei .",
    "the triple-@xmath9 reaction concurrently increases the mass fraction of hcno material while depleting helium @xcite .",
    "the mass fraction of hcno material is important because it regulates the rate at which hydrogen burns to helium , determining the initial composition and the characteristics of the burst @xcite .",
    "the mass fraction of hcno material can decrease through processing into heavier isotopes via the @xmath10@xmath1 and @xmath11ne(@xmath12na breakout reactions @xcite .",
    "this can happen either during the burst , when peak temperatures exceed @xmath13 k , or during the quiescent , non - bursting phase . at temperatures characteristic of the quiescent phase ( @xmath14 k ) only the @xmath10@xmath1 reaction allows significant leakage out of the hcno cycle @xcite .",
    "in this case the leak of hcno material into heavier isotopes depends on the ratio between the @xmath9 capture rate of @xmath7 and its decay rate @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the thermally averaged @xmath17o(@xmath18 reaction rate per particle pair , @xmath19 is the avogadro constant , @xmath20 is the stellar mass density , @xmath21 is the @xmath22 mass fraction and @xmath23 its atomic mass .",
    "what happens therefore depends on the relatively unknown @xmath0 reaction rate : if the rate is comparable to the @xcite rate , then the leak will be important in reducing the hcno mass fraction of eq .",
    "[ [ eq : hcno ] ] and therefore in decreasing the rate at which hydrogen burns into helium as matter sinks . with long burst recurrence times of thousands of seconds or even days",
    "@xcite , even small reaction rates can be significant , allowing hydrogen to survive to great depths .",
    "in addition , a rate of this magnitude would deplete @xmath7 above the ignition point during the burst runaway , ensuring that little or no @xmath7 survives for the next burst and requiring the accretion of a fresh layer of material .",
    "however , the @xmath9 width of the dominant 4.033 mev state in @xmath1 is not well known , so the rate could be lower . if the rate is lower , there will not be any significant leak out of the hcno cycle , whence hydrogen would burn to helium at a faster rate , depleting hydrogen from the ignition zone .",
    "in addition , a lower rate would prevent or weaken the breakout via @xmath10@xmath1 ensuring less energy generation during the initial stages of the burst @xcite .",
    "the survival of a significant fraction of @xmath7 in the upper layers would increase the hydrogen burning prior to subsequent bursts , thus altering the composition at the time of the runaway .    in this paper",
    "we show that a sufficiently small @xmath17o(@xmath18 rate can even prevent subsequent runaways , causing hydrogen and helium to burn stably .",
    "stable burning creates copious amounts of @xmath24 and other @xmath25 nuclei which have implications for superbursts .",
    "astronomical observations may lead to better constraints on this rate and motivate future measurements of the @xmath0 reaction rate .",
    "such measurements would help refine current x - ray burst and superburst models .",
    "for temperatures below @xmath26 k , the @xmath27 reaction rate is dominated by the resonant contribution of the 3/2@xmath28 state at 4.033 mev in @xmath29ne , which is @xmath9-unbound by 504 kev .",
    "appreciable resonant contributions also come from the states at 4.379 , 4.600 , and 4.712 mev . at higher temperatures contributions from higher - lying states",
    "must be included .",
    "non - resonant capture also plays a role , but is only really important below 10@xmath30 k.    the rate was first calculated by @xcite and later revised by @xcite and @xcite . in this paper",
    "we provide a new estimate of the rate based on recent experiments and calculations .",
    "we calculate three rates , a best rate and upper and lower limits .",
    "the s factor for non - resonant capture was calculated by @xcite within the framework of the direct capture model of @xcite , adopting the known reduced @xmath9 widths of the bound mirror states in @xmath29f",
    ". a constant s factor of 23 mev b was adopted by @xcite for the reaction rate calculation .",
    "the reactions @xmath17n+@xmath9 and @xmath17o+@xmath9 are isospin mirrors leading to analog states in @xmath29f and @xmath29ne . therefore it is justified to assume that the reduced @xmath9 widths in @xmath29f and @xmath29ne are similar , which is supported by a comparison by @xcite .",
    "the non - resonant contribution was also calculated by @xcite using the generator coordinate method . despite the fact that the authors of this work state that the @xmath31 transition probabilities are overestimated and that the resulting s factor should be considered an upper limit on the non - resonant contribution",
    ", they find an s factor only 85% as large as the @xcite result .",
    "for the non - resonant contribution , we adopt the @xcite calculation for our best rate , 1/3 of it for our lower limit , and use the @xcite calculation for our upper limit .",
    "the contributions of resonances are proportional to @xmath32 with @xmath33 the @xmath34 partial width and @xmath35 the total width of the state ; for the states under consideration here , no other channels are open , so @xmath36 . in addition , for the two lowest - lying states , @xmath37 , and their strengths are directly proportional to their @xmath9 widths @xmath38 .",
    "these widths are not known for the resonances of interest and can not be measured directly without an intense , radioactive @xmath17o beam at low energy .",
    "several indirect measurements of @xmath38 for these resonances have been published .",
    "@xcite analyzed the @xmath9 reduced width of the analog state of the 4.033 level in @xmath29f and studied carefully the dependence of the result on the model parameters . these calculations led to an @xmath9 width of 11.5 @xmath39ev .",
    "an alternative approach is the measurement of the @xmath9-decay branching ratio @xmath38/@xmath35 .",
    "two recent experiments , @xcite and @xcite , found 90% confidence level upper limits of 4.3@xmath4010@xmath41 and 6@xmath4010@xmath41 , respectively . to deduce the @xmath9 width from this ratio , the total width must also be known . a lifetime measurement by @xcite and a coulomb excitation experiment by @xcite set 2@xmath42 limits on the total width , 6.6 mev @xmath43 445 mev .",
    "the lifetime of the mirror state in @xmath29f corresponds to a total width of 73 mev .",
    "we adopt the alpha width of @xcite for our recommended rate .",
    "the upper limit of 130 @xmath39ev for the @xmath9 width is set by the measured 90% confidence level upper limits on limits on @xmath35 and the @xmath9-decay branching ratio .",
    "considering the uncertainties in the determination of reduced @xmath9 widths from states in the analog nucleus far below the coulomb barrier , we consider an @xmath9 width of 3% of our recommended value , 345 nev , as a conservative lower limit .    for the @xmath29ne state at 4.379 mev , @xcite assumed a reduced @xmath9 width of 0.02 , leading to an @xmath9 width of 700 @xmath39ev .",
    "three experiments report",
    "@xmath9-decay branching ratios for this state , 0.044 @xmath44 0.032 @xcite , 0.016 @xmath44 0.05 @xcite , and a 90% confidence level upper limit of 3.9@xmath45 @xcite .",
    "the first of these was based on poor statistics and represents an upper limit within @xmath46 , while the energy resolution of the second measurement was not sufficient to resolve the 4.379 mev level from nearby states , limiting the reliability of the extracted @xmath9-decay branching ratio .",
    "therefore we adopt the upper limit of @xcite .",
    "the lifetime experiment of @xcite set a 1@xmath42 lower limit on the total width of 5.5 mev .",
    "a shell model calculation using the usd interaction cited in @xcite found a radiative width of 458 mev . @xcite",
    "have measured the @xmath9 width of the @xmath29f analog state , from which @xcite have deduced a reduced @xmath9 width of 0.0078@xmath47 .",
    "adopting the shell model calculation for the radiative width and the reduced @xmath9 width from the analog state leads to our recommended @xmath9 width of 190 @xmath39ev . to calculate a lower limit on the @xmath9 width we use the 1@xmath42 lower limits on the total width and the reduced @xmath9 width and find 1 @xmath39ev .",
    "our upper limit on the @xmath9 width is based on the shell model calculation for the radiative width and the experimental upper limit on the @xmath9-decay branching ratio ; using these values we calculate an upper limit of 2.3 mev .    above 1 gk , the states at 4.600 , 4.712 , and",
    "5.092 mev make appreciable contributions to the reaction rate .",
    "the parameters of these resonances were taken from @xcite . using these results we calculated three different rates of the @xmath17o(@xmath48)@xmath29ne reaction : a recommended rate , an upper limit and a lower limit .",
    "the rates are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : o15ne19_rate ] .",
    "model 1 represents the upper limit for the reaction rate , model 2 represents the recommended reaction rate , and model 3 represents a conservative lower limit .",
    "we calculate three x - ray burst models ( fig .  [ [ fig : lt ] ] ) that differ only in their different @xmath10@xmath1 reaction rates .",
    "these models are calculated using a new general relativistic type i x - ray burst simulation code that couples the general relativistic hydrodynamics code , ` agile ` @xcite , with the generic nuclear reaction network of @xcite using the operator - split method of @xcite .",
    "specifically , the calculation of a single time - step splits into four steps : 1 ) the nuclear reaction network is evolved in all zones assuming fixed density and temperature .",
    "2 ) the change in nuclear binding energy enters ` agile ` as a source term and the hydrodynamics is evolved .",
    "this step includes the self - consistent accretion of the rest mass .",
    "this step also calculates the turbulent velocity that determines the convective mixing of the composition 3 ) the convective mixing of the composition is evolved by solving a simple diffusion equation based on the turbulent velocity and a mixing lenght is unimportant .",
    "we note that setting it equal to the pressure scale height , which is typically done in stellar evolution calculations is unphysical , since the pressure scale height of the neutron star atmosphere is much larger than the convective zone itself . ] , @xmath49 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "4 ) finally , the composition is updated using the advection that was calculated in step 1 using the second - order scheme described below .",
    "the code uses an arbitrarily relativistic and arbitrarily degenerate equation of state and includes radiative , conductive , and convective heat transport as described in @xcite .",
    "we calculate the radiative opacities due to thomson scattering and free - free absorption using the analytic formulations of @xcite .",
    "we use the same conductivity formulations for electron scattering on electrons , ions , phonons , and impurities as @xcite .    `",
    "agile ` solves the general relativistic equations in a spherically symmetric geometry on a comoving grid .",
    "[ [ fig : pyzones ] ] shows how the computational domain is discretized into 103 log - ratioed grid zones with a column density where @xmath50 , so @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the neutron star radius , @xmath53 is the neutron star mass , @xmath20 is the density , @xmath54 is the pressure , and @xmath55 is the surface acceleration of gravity . ]",
    "ranging from @xmath56 g @xmath57 to @xmath58 g @xmath57 . in this paper , ` agile ` does not employ its adaptive grid capability .",
    "the composition is advected using a second - order total variation diminishing upwind scheme with a van leer limiter .",
    "the computational domain is bounded by a realistic core boundary interface @xcite and a relativistically corrected grey atmosphere ( see @xcite and @xcite ) . due to numerical constraints , previous work ( e.g. @xcite ) has set the outer boundary at @xmath59 while assuming no nuclear burning and an opacity dominated by thomson scattering at lower pressures . while the assumption of neglible nuclear burning is correct , the assumption of a constant opacity is off by up to 15% .",
    "the reason is that free - free absorption still contributes to the opacity at this pressure .",
    "since the grey atmosphere model relates the opacity and the luminosity to the temperature and the temperature gradient , an inaccurate opacity at the boundary affects the temperature profile through the entire model .",
    "this approximation is perhaps acceptable at low accretion rates or very high accretion rates since it does not change the overall bursting behavior of the system , but it is very critical at the transition rate between stable burning and unstable burning as stability is determined by a very fine balance between the cooling rate of the radiation transport and the heating rate of the nuclear reactions .",
    "the solution is to use a 4th order runge - kutta method and numerically integrate the hydrostatic heat and pressure equations ( see @xcite and @xcite ) from the model boundary out to @xmath60 where the opacity finally becomes constant .",
    "although heavier ashes with @xmath61 predominate , _ iff _ the burst peak temperature and the hydrogen concentration at ignition are high @xcite , @xcite showed that a self - consistent x - ray burst simulation have comparably smaller peak temperatures and a smaller hydrogen concentration at the ignition point .",
    "therefore most of the ashes concentrate around @xmath62 with only a very small fraction of the nuclei reacting beyond this mass range .",
    "this means that we can use a smaller reaction network without changing the underlying burst physics of the opacity , the equation of state , or the nuclear energy release rate .",
    "the nuclear reaction network used in this work includes 298 isotopes ( see table  [ [ fig : sunet ] ] ) .",
    "all the connecting particle reactions are taken from reaclib ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this includes all isotopes between the valley of stability and the proton dripline up to @xmath63 . here",
    "isotopes with @xmath64-half lives @xmath65 day are considered `` stable '' on the timescale of the burst intervals , so their daughters are not included . above the @xmath63 waiting point , only isotopes between the proton drip line and half lives less than 1 minute are included .",
    "this is because protons only capture on these high - z isotopes during the burst s peak temperature which is only sustained for a few seconds .",
    "weak rates up to @xmath66 are taken from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "since only a small fraction of material is processed above @xmath66 , it is a reasonable approximation to ignore neutrino losses from heavier isotopes @xcite .",
    "these considerations significantly reduce the size of the network which decreases the simulation run - time .",
    "since this paper investigates the transition between stable and unstable burning , we can not assume an artifical iron - atmosphere for the initial setup .",
    "the reason is that an iron - atmosphere progenitor allows more h / he to accumulate which results in a very energetic burst that could heat the atmosphere to such a degree that the thermal inertia ( see @xcite ) of the initial burst would ensure that h / he would keep burning at the same rate it was accreted and thus resulting in stable burning . as iron - atmospheres never occur on accreting neutron stars in reality , the initial model was made by accreting and computing several bursts until a limit cycle equilibrium was reached . at this point ,",
    "the composition of the burst ashes was copied to the bottom of the model - envelope after which the limit cycle equilibrium was reachieved as the model adjusted boundary conditions to the new temperature profile resulting from the changed thermal conductivity in the copied shells .",
    "this creates a model that is physically independent of artificial starting conditions and which is approximately self - consistent with the chosen reaction library . at the same time this avoids the need to compute the evolution long enough to replace the entire model envelope which is shown in fig .  [ fig : pyzones ] .",
    ".the table shows the list of isotopes which describes the @xmath67-process .",
    "see the main text for details . this reaction network has been used in the following works @xcite . [ cols=\">,<,>,<,>,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we selected a global ( relativistically local ) accretion rate of @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) , similar to the accretion rates used by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the accreted composition is assumed to be solar @xcite .",
    "the underlying fiducial ns core has a gravitional mass of @xmath70 and an areal radius of @xmath71 .    fig .",
    "[ [ fig : lt ] ] shows an initial burst for all models which can be ascribed to the fact that a limit cycle equilibrium ( see @xcite ) has not been reached .",
    "the first burst of any model is usually `` special '' , yet whereas models 1 and 2 both repeat this bursting behavior , model 3 turns stable after the second burst fizzles . as model 3 turns out to describe an oscillating form of stable helium burning in a thin shell ( see @xcite ) with a period of around 4 hours , we performed a convergence study of this model to determine the required number of zones to resolve this burning shell .",
    "[ [ fig : lt ] ] shows that the oscillation is resolved in models having more than 100 zones in the covered range of column depths whereas 75 zones or less is insufficient . in the next section ,",
    "we divide the models into two categories , bursting and non - bursting .",
    "models 1 and 2 include comparably high rates and exhibit unstable burning / bursting behavior . during the quiescent phase the @xmath10@xmath1 reaction establishes an outflow from the hcno cycle , thereby reducing @xmath8 and ensuring that hydrogen burns slowly and thus survives to a great depth .    for model 2 the thermonuclear instability criterion for a degenerate atmosphere ( see e.g.  @xcite ) is violated at y = 7.9 @xmath72 g @xmath57 .",
    "one hundred seconds before the burst peak temperature is reached , the ratio @xmath52 of eq .  [ [ eq : leak ] ] is @xmath73 ; @xmath52 exceeds @xmath74 about ten seconds prior to the burst which is just before the @xmath75@xmath76-reaction becomes competitive and establishes the @xmath77-process @xcite . after escaping the hcno cycle the reaction flow proceeds through the heavier isotopes as described in @xcite",
    ". during the runaway , the @xmath10@xmath1 reaction will eliminate most of the @xmath7 , since @xmath7 is only formed via the slow @xmath78 @xmath79 @xmath7 , thus reducing @xmath8 .",
    "this means that the conversion of hydrogen to helium for the subsequent burst will be delayed , as explained in section [ sec : introduction ] .",
    "the final cno abundance would also be influenced by the amount of accreted cno material ; small values , which might arise from spallation in the atmosphere @xcite , have been shown to create chaotic bursting behavior @xcite .      the low rate of model 3 ( c.f .",
    "[ fig : o15ne19_rate ] ) stops the bursts and causes a slowly oscillating luminosity as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : lt ] .",
    "this oscillating behavior will be explained now .",
    "a lower @xmath10@xmath1 reaction rate restricts the outflow from the hcno cycle , thereby causing a significant build up of the hcno mass fraction at an earlier point ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lower ] ) .",
    "the large @xmath8 mass fraction in turn converts hydrogen into helium at an increasing rate , fully depleting hydrogen at @xmath80 g @xmath57 .",
    "the associated energy generation raises the temperature of the envelope to @xmath81 k and increases the rate of the 3-@xmath9 reaction , transforming the helium into @xmath24 .",
    "this is immediately transformed into @xmath6 and @xmath7 as long as hydrogen is present .",
    "the higher temperature moves the helium burning front further out at lower densities , destroying hydrogen through the hcno cycle up to column densities of @xmath82 g @xmath57 .",
    "after the hydrogen has been destroyed , energy generation decreases and the layer cools as it is advected down .",
    "since there is no hydrogen , the 3-@xmath9 reaction creates @xmath24 , which may capture another @xmath9 particle to become @xmath83 .",
    "as the temperature of the envelope is now lower , the 3-@xmath9 reaction increases @xmath8 at a slower rate , whence hydrogen is burned slower .",
    "this allows hydrogen to survive to a depth of about @xmath84 g @xmath57 until the increasing temperatures finally speed up the 3-@xmath9 reaction to make sufficient hcno material to burn hydrogen off again . as a result",
    "the burning front of the hydrogen slowly moves back and forth between @xmath82 g @xmath57 and @xmath84 g @xmath57 .",
    "even while burning in this stable mode ( as defined by a one - dimensional model with a lower estimate of the @xmath10@xmath1 reaction rate ) the neutron star may burst due to other reasons which are not considered in this model , e.g. , localized burning or changes in the local accretion rate due to accretion instabilities . in this case",
    "a low @xmath10@xmath1 reaction rate will cause a restricted outflow of @xmath7 during the burst , thus preserving hcno material for the next burst .",
    "this causes the hcno cycle to run comparably faster until the subsequent burst , which means that more hydrogen is depleted by stable burning , thereby increasing the observable @xmath9-parameter of the x - ray burst source .",
    "superbursts have been observed from a number of sources @xcite and have been theorized to be caused by carbon burning in the neutron star ocean @xcite .",
    "the narrow parameter space in which superbursts are possible is given in @xcite , but current calculations @xcite have not been able to generate the required amounts of @xmath24 ; in addition , these calculations leave residual @xmath85 which will stably burn the @xmath24 into @xmath83 as matter sinks deeper into the ocean .    however , fig .",
    "[ fig : lower ] shows that the ashes of stable burning almost solely comprise @xmath24 along with other isotopes , mainly @xmath83 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "this means that stable burning of this kind need not be maintained at all times , but can work for short periods of a few months , which are sufficient to generate the required carbon for the next superburst .",
    "@xcite estimate a duration of weeks for the cooling time of a superburst , during which the ocean is still hot enough to prevent x - ray bursts from occuring .",
    "this means that continuously accreting matter burns stably during this time , whence a significant fraction of the nuclei shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lower ] could be generated .",
    "one might also speculate that the local accretion rate is not the same over the entire star , and that high local accretion rates might cause material to burn stably .",
    "it is therefore important to establish the value of the critical accretion rate where unstable burning turns stable ( see @xcite and @xcite ) as well as obtain a good model of how the accretion flow distributes itself on the star .",
    "we have demonstrated the significance of the @xmath0 reaction to x - ray burst behavior and suggested a lower limit on the rate which could and should be pursued experimentally .",
    "long intermittent periods of stable burning , which may last for months , have been observed from burst sources ; a lower value of the @xmath0 reaction rate will help stabilize stable burning .",
    "the reaction rate determines the value of the critical accretion rate .",
    "in addition we have shown a way to generate the necessary carbon for the superburst theory to be valid .",
    "we have also shown that several different kinds of @xmath25 nuclei are generated ; applying this to superburst calculations requires proper knowledge of the fusion rates between these nuclei .",
