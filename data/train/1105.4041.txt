    "quantum correlations play an important role in quantum information and computation and have become a hot topic of intense research in recent years .",
    "entanglement is a special kind of quantum correlation and has been recognized as an essential resource for many operations in quantum information processing @xcite . however , the entanglement is not the only type of quantum correlation and there exist quantum tasks that display the quantum advantage without entanglement @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite that other nonclassical correlation , namely , quantum discord @xcite can be responsible for the computational speedup for certain quantum tasks .",
    "quantum discord , introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , is defined as the difference between the quantum mutual information and the classical correlation and is nonzero even for separate mixed states .",
    "therefore , the quantum discord may be regarded as a more general and fundamental resource for quantum information processing .",
    "on the other hand , a real quantum systems will unavoidably be influenced by surrounding environments .",
    "the interaction between the quantum system and its environment leads to a rapid destruction of quantum coherence , which is the main problem for the realization of quantum information processing .",
    "therefore , it is very important to understand the dynamics of quantum correlations of open systems and find potential applications in quantum information theory .",
    "many efforts have been devoted to the study of the dynamics of quantum correlation under various decoherence channels @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the discord is more robust than entanglement under the markovian environments @xcite and vanishes only at some time points under non - markovian environment @xcite .",
    "recently , the dynamics of quantum and classical correlations have been studied in the presence of nondissipative decoherence and the phenomenon of the sudden transition from classical to quantum decoherence in a finite time interval has been reported @xcite .",
    "some of these phenomena have been observed in the recent experiment @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the phenomenon of sudden transition between classical and quantum decoherence in the study of quantum discord for the dissipative cavity qed system , which consists of two noninteracting two - level atoms , each trapped in a dissipative cavity .",
    "firstly , we assume that the two atoms are prepared initially in the x - type quantum states and show that the quantum discord of two atoms is not destroyed by the dissipation of the cavities for a finite time interval and revivals to a stable value after damping oscillation , which means that there is a stationary quantum discord between the two atoms as the time approach to infinite .",
    "this implies that the initial quantum discord of two atoms can be partially preserved even when they are put into the two spatially separated dissipative cavities , respectively .",
    "furthermore , we can see clearly that the transition time depends on the parameter of the initial states of the two atoms and the mean photon number of the coherent field . particularly , it is interesting to point out that the quantum discord of two atoms is completely unaffected by the dissipation of the cavities if we choose the suitable ratio , which depends on the decay rate of two cavities and the atoms - field coupling constant . then , we find that the sudden transition phenomenon does not appear in this system if the two atoms are initially in the werner state .",
    "instead , the stationary quantum discord of the two atoms still exists in the long - time regime .",
    "it is worth noting that the amount of the stationary quantum discord between two atoms can be enhanced by increasing the value of the ratio .",
    "we consider the system consisting of two noninteracting two - level atoms , each trapped inside a dissipative cavity ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the interaction between atoms and cavities can be written as ( @xmath0 ) @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the atom - field coupling constant , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the creation and annihilation operator of the single - mode cavity field , and @xmath5 is the atomic inversion operator , @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) is the atomic spin flip operators .",
    "the symbols @xmath8 and @xmath9 refer to the excited and ground states of the two - level atom . @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the atomic transition frequency and cavity frequency , respectively .",
