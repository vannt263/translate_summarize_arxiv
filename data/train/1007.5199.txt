    "let us begin with heuristically explaining the usual power - counting argument in field theory .",
    "as the simplest example , let us consider a scalar field with the canonical kinetic term : @xmath4 where an overdot represents a time derivative .",
    "the scaling dimension of the scalar field @xmath5 is determined by demanding that the kinetic term be invariant under the scaling @xmath6 where @xmath7 is an arbitrary number and @xmath8 is the scaling dimension to be determined .",
    "the invariance of the kinetic term under the scaling leads to the condition @xmath9 where @xmath10 comes from @xmath11 , @xmath12 from @xmath13 , @xmath14 from two time derivatives and @xmath15 from two @xmath5 s .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath16 . in other words , the scalar field scales like energy . with this scaling in mind ,",

    "now , it is expected that we have a good theoretical control of ultraviolet ( uv ) , i.e. high @xmath19 , behaviors if the exponent is non - positive . since @xmath16",
    ", this condition leads to @xmath24 .",
    "this is the power - counting renormalizability condition .",
    "we are interested in gravity .",
    "unfortunately , einstein gravity is not power - counting renormalizable .",
    "this is because the curvature is a highly nonlinear functional of the metric and there are graviton interaction terms with @xmath17 higher than @xmath25 .",
    "the non - renormalizability is one of difficulties in attempts to quantize general relativity .",
    "as already stated , hoava - lifshitz gravity is power - counting renormalizable .",
    "how does it evade the above argument ?",
    "the basic idea is very simple but potentially dangerous : abandoning lorentz symmetry and invoking a different kind of scaling in the uv .",
    "the scaling invoked here , often called _",
    "anisotropic scaling _ or _",
    "lifshitz scaling _",
    ", is @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a number called _ dynamical critical exponent_.    let us now see how the power - counting argument changes if the scaling is anisotropic as in ( [ eqn : anisotropic - scaling ] ) .",
    "invariance of the canonical kinetic term ( [ eqn : scalar - kineticterm ] ) under this scaling leads to @xmath28 where @xmath27 comes from @xmath11 , @xmath12 from @xmath13 , @xmath29 from two time derivatives and @xmath15 from two @xmath5 s",
    ". then we obtain @xmath30 this of course recovers the previous result @xmath16 for @xmath31 .",

    "the theory is power - counting super - renormalizable .    from the above consideration",
    ", it is expected that gravity may become renormalizable if the anisotropic scaling with @xmath38 is realized in the uv .",
    "we would like to realize the anisotropic scaling with @xmath38 in the uv to construct renormalizable nonlinear theories .",
    "on the other hand , in order to recover the lorentz invariance in the infrared ( ir ) , we would like to realize the usual scaling with @xmath31 at low energy .",
    "a simple example is a scalar field with the following free - part action : @xmath39 where @xmath40 @xmath41 is the energy scale corresponding to the transition from the @xmath31 scaling to the @xmath0 scaling , @xmath42 is a constant , @xmath43 is the sound speed , i.e. the limit of speed in the ir , @xmath44 is the mass of the field , and @xmath45 is the laplacian in the @xmath12-dimensional space  , @xmath46 and @xmath47 then experiments such as fermi gbm / lat  @xcite and magic  @xcite set a lower bound on @xmath41 as @xmath48 . ] .    in the uv",
    ", the sixth - order spatial derivative term dominates over lower - order terms and balances with the time kinetic term which includes two time derivatives .",
    "this naturally leads to the @xmath0 scaling . on the other hand , in the ir , the second - order spatial derivative term and the mass term are dominant and , thus , the @xmath31 scaling is realized . in this way",
    ", it is possible to realize the @xmath0 scaling in the uv and the @xmath31 scaling in the ir .",
    "however , one must be aware that all `` constants '' in the action are subject to running under the renormalization group ( rg ) flow .",
    "of course , the sound speed is not an exception . if we consider many fields then the sound speed for each field should run under the rg flow  @xcite .",
    "we need a mechanism or symmetry to make sound speeds of different species to be essentially the same at low energies .",
    "more generally speaking , we need a mechanism or symmetry to suppress lorentz violating operators at low energies .",
    "perhaps , embedding the theory into a larger theory is necessary .",
    "one such possibility is related to supersymmetry  @xcite .      as explained in the previous subsection , the way the power - counting renormalizability is achieved is to violate the lorentz invariance and to invoke the anisotropic scaling with the dynamical critical exponent @xmath38 .",
    "since the lorentz invariance is not respected , we treat the time coordinate @xmath49 and the spatial coordinates @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) separately .",
    "the fundamental symmetry of the theory is the invariance under space - independent time reparametrization and time - dependent spatial diffeomorphism : @xmath52 the time - dependent spatial diffeomorphism allows an arbitrary change of spatial coordinates on each constant time surface .",
    "however , the time reparametrization here is not allowed to depend on spatial coordinates . as a result , unlike general relativity , in hoava - lifshitz gravity the foliation of spacetime by constant time hypersurfaces is not just a choice of coordinates but is a physical entity .",
    "indeed , the foliation is preserved by the symmetry transformation ( [ eqn : foliation - preserving - diffeo ] ) .",
    "for this reason , the map ( [ eqn : foliation - preserving - diffeo ] ) is called _ foliation preserving diffeomorphism_.    in addition to the foliation preserving diffeomorphism invariance , we assume that the theory is invariant under the _ spatial parity _",
    "@xmath53  @xcite and the _ time reflection _ @xmath54 .    finally , in order to render the theory power - counting renormalizable",
    ", we would like to realize the anisotropic scaling with @xmath38 at high energy . in the present article , for concreteness",
    ", we mainly focus on the case with @xmath0 .",
    "basic quantities of hoava - lifshitz gravity are @xmath55 from which we can construct a four - dimensional spacetime metric of the adm form as @xmath56 while the shift @xmath57 and the @xmath12d metric @xmath58 depend on both the time coordinate @xmath49 and the spatial coordinates @xmath59 , the lapse @xmath60 is assumed to be a function of the time only .",
    "this condition on the lapse is called the _",
    "projectability condition_.    the projectability condition stems from the foliation preserving diffeomorphism .",
    "the lapse represents a gauge freedom associated with the space - independent time reparametrization @xmath61 and , thus , it is fairly natural to restrict it to be space - independent  . of course",
    ", the projectability condition is compatible with the foliation preserving diffeomorphism .",
    "the transformation of the basic quantities ( [ eqn : basicquantities ] ) under the infinitesimal foliation preserving diffeomorphism , @xmath62 is defined as follows .",
    "@xmath63 where @xmath64 .",
    "note that @xmath65 is independent of spatial coordinates since @xmath66 and @xmath60 are functions of time only .",
    "thus the projectability condition is compatible with the foliation preserving diffeomorphism : the foliation preserving diffeomorphism maps a space - independent @xmath60 to a space - independent @xmath60 .",
    "the equation of motion for the lapse corresponds to the generator of the time reparametrization and is called the _",
    "hamiltonian constraint_. since the lapse is independent of spatial coordinates , its variations are also space - independent .",
    "this means that the hamiltonian constraint in hoava - lifshitz gravity is not a local equation but an equation integrated over a whole space . in subsection",
    "[ subsec : darkmatter ] we shall discuss cosmological implication of the global nature of the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "the theory should respect the foliation preserving diffeomorphism .",
    "we can then use the following ingredients in the action : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the determinant of @xmath58 , @xmath69 is the @xmath12-dimensional covariant derivative compatible with @xmath58 and @xmath70 is the ricci tensor of @xmath58 . note that the ricci tensor includes all information about the riemann tensor since weyl tensor identically vanishes in @xmath12-dimensions .",
    "we should include time - derivative of the @xmath12-dimensional metric in the action in order to make the metric dynamical .",
    "however , @xmath71 is not covariant under the spatial diffeomorphism and , therefore , @xmath71 should appear in the action as a part of the covariant quantity called extrinsic curvature , @xmath72 the extrinsic curvature transforms as a second - rank symmetric tensor under the spatial diffeomorphism and as a scalar under the time reparametrization .",
    "the time kinetic term for the metric is obtained by squaring the extrinsic curvature and properly contracting indices .",
    "there are two ways to contract indices : @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath2 are constants , and @xmath75 .",
    "in general relativity , @xmath2 is fixed to @xmath10 because of higher symmetry . on the other hand , in hoava - lifshitz gravity ,",
    "any value of @xmath2 is compatible with the foliation preserving diffeomorphism invariance and thus @xmath2 is not fixed .",
    "we shall not include terms including derivatives of the extrinsic curvature in the action .",
    "this is consistent if the theory without those higher derivative terms is renormalizable : those terms would be non - renormalizable and thus would not be generated by quantum correction .",
    "for the same reason , we shall not include terms cubic or higher order in the extrinsic curvature .",
    "invariant terms made of time derivatives of the shift would inevitably include second or higher time derivatives of the spatial metric .",
    "for the reason explained above , we shall not include those higher derivative terms in the action .",
    "time derivative of the lapse corresponds to the connection in @xmath10-dimension spanned by the time but the curvature in @xmath10-dimension is always zero .",
    "thus , there is no invariant term made of time derivatives of the lapse .",
    "of course , the spatial derivative of the lapse vanishes because of the projectability condition .",
    "since terms in the kinetic action ( [ eqn : kinetic - action ] ) include two time derivatives , we should include terms with six spatial derivatives in order to realize the @xmath0 scaling in the uv .",
    "( for a general choice of @xmath27 ( @xmath76 ) in the uv , we should include terms with @xmath77 spatial derivatives . )",
    "the foliation preserving diffeomorphism invariance allows five such terms in the action , @xmath78,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) are constants .",
    "note that the other possible term @xmath81 is a linear combination of the above terms up to total derivative and , thus , does not have to be included explicitly .",
    "we do not include terms with more than six spatial derivatives since they would be non - renormalizable and thus would not be generated by quantum corrections if the theory without them is renormalizable .      in the ir , terms with less number of spatial derivatives in the action",
    "become important .",
    "there are two independent terms with four spatial derivatives @xmath82,\\ ] ] one term with two spatial derivatives @xmath83 and a constant @xmath84 where @xmath79 ( @xmath85 ) are constants .",
    "we have written down all possible terms consistent with the symmetry of the theory except for terms involving more than two time derivatives and terms with more than six spatial derivatives .",
    "as already stated , those higher - derivative terms excluded in the above construction would be non - renormalizable and , thus , would not be generated by quantum corrections if the theory without them is renormalizable .",
    "the theory defined in this way is power - counting renormalizable and , thus , expected to be renormalizable although renormalizability beyond the power - counting argument has not been proved .",
    "also , the theory is expected to be unitary since the action does not include more than two time derivatives .",
    "note that the constants @xmath74 , @xmath2 and @xmath79 ( @xmath86 ) are subject to running under the rg flow .      in the uv",
    "the theory naturally exhibits the @xmath0 scaling as the second time derivative terms @xmath87 and the sixth spatial derivative terms @xmath88 balance with each other .    on the other hand , in the ir",
    "the forth and sixth spatial derivative terms , @xmath89 and @xmath88 , are unimportant .",
    "we therefore have the following action describing the ir behavior of the theory : @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 , and we have set @xmath93 to unity by rescaling of the time coordinate .",
    "this ir action naturally exhibits the @xmath31 scaling .",
    "moreover , the action looks identical to the einstein - hilbert action in the adm formalism if @xmath94 .",
    "there are however two important differences : ( i ) @xmath2 does not have to be @xmath10 and is subject to running under the rg flow ; ( ii ) the projectability condition restricts the lapse @xmath60 to be a function of the time only . regarding ( i ) , the rg flow of the theory has not been investigated and , thus , we do not know whether @xmath3 is an ir fixed point of the rg flow or not . on the other hand",
    ", we shall discuss cosmological implication of the point ( ii ) in subsection [ subsec : darkmatter ] .",
    "adding the matter action @xmath95 , the total action is @xmath96 here , we have rescaled the time coordinate to set @xmath97 to unity .",

    "generation of cosmological perturbations from quantum fluctuations is nothing but the oscillation followed by the freeze - out .",
    "therefore , the condition for generation of cosmological perturbations is @xmath305 with the @xmath31 dispersion relation ( [ eqn : dispersionz=1 ] ) , this condition is equivalent to @xmath306 for expanding universe ( @xmath307 ) .",
    "therefore , if @xmath31 then generation of cosmological perturbations from quantum fluctuations requires accelerated expansion of the universe , i.e. inflation . for example , for power law expansion @xmath308 , @xmath309 is required .",
    "observational data of the cosmic microwave background strongly indicates that the primordial cosmological perturbations have an almost scale - invariant spectrum .",
    "it is easy to see that the scale - invariance also requires inflation .",

    "in cosmology the energy scale is set by the hubble expansion rate @xmath167 .",
    "thus , we expect that @xmath310 since cosmological perturbations with different scales are generated at different times , the scale - invariance is nothing but the constancy of the right hand side of ( [ eqn : deltaphiz=1 ] ) . noting that @xmath302 , this implies the exponential expansion of the universe @xmath311 , namely inflation .",
    "we have seen that , for @xmath31 , both the generation of cosmological perturbations and the scale - invariance of generated perturbations require the existence of an inflationary epoch in the early universe .      the condition ( [ eqn : osc - freeze ] ) for generation of cosmological perturbations is valid irrespective of the dispersion relation . in hoava - lifshitz gravity , to realize the anisotropic scaling ( [ eqn : anisotropic - scaling ] ) , the dispersion relation for a physical degree of freedom in the uv should be @xmath312 where @xmath41 is some energy scale . by substituting this to the condition ( [ eqn : osc - freeze ] )",

    "one such possibility is related to supersymmetry  @xcite .",
    "* is there an analogue of vainshtein effect  @xcite ? in subsection [ subsec : continuity ] , non - perturbative continuity of the @xmath1 limit was shown only for spherically - symmetric , static , vacuum configurations .",
    "we need to consider more general situations in order to see how general the non - perturbative continuity is . * in @xcite , based on exact results in some simple cases ,",
    "it was conjectured that there is no caustic for constant time hypersurfaces .",
    "we need to provide evidences for this conjecture in more general situations if a proof is difficult",
    ". perhaps , numerical simulations similar to those in @xcite are necessary . * in @xcite",
    "it was proved that a spherically - symmetric solution should include a time - dependent region near the center . on the other hand , as shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : scalargraviton ] of the present article , the vacuum region far from the center recovers the standard schwarzschild geometry .",
    "since the size of the dynamical region is expected to be of the fundamental scale , the dynamical nature of the central region is not really relevant for macroscopic objects such as astrophysical stars .",
    "microscopically , however , this could be rather significant .",
    "we would like to know , e.g. the typical size of the dynamical region and the motion of its boundary .",
    "* as already stressed in @xcite , we need to know if microscopic lumps of `` dark matter as an integration constant '' can play the role of particles in usual dark matter models from macroscopic viewpoint . interactions among them such as collisions and bounces need to be understood . at astrophysical scales , we need to see if collective behavior of a group of large number of microscopic lumps can more or less mimic behavior of a cluster of particles with velocity dispersion and vorticity .",
    "clearly , detailed investigation is necessary to understand rich dynamics of `` dark matter '' from microscopic to macroscopic scales . * as shown in ( [ eqn : defc(t ) ] ) , `` dark matter as an integration constant '' is generated in the early universe even if it vanishes initially .",
    "this formula can be applied to superhorizon perturbations . given a concrete model of the matter sector , therefore",
    ", it is straightforward to estimate the typical amplitude and spectrum of the `` dark matter '' . if a single physical degree of freedom is responsible for both the source term @xmath246 in ( [ eqn : defc(t ) ] ) and generation of curvature perturbations then it should be possible to realize adiabatic initial conditions for the late time evolution of perturbations .",
    "( see @xcite for classical late time evolution . )",
    "it is worthwhile investigating this possibility in details . *",
    "the mechanism reviewed in subsection [ subsec : scale - invariant ] generates scale - invariant cosmological perturbations without a need for inflation",
    ". it would be interesting to see whether renormalization effects such as anomalous dimension can break the exact scale - invariance and explain the observed spectral tilt .",
    "* in the early universe , it is expected that @xmath2 should deviate from @xmath10 under the rg flow and that the scalar graviton can be treated perturbatively .",
    "since the scalar graviton has the @xmath0 anisotropic scaling in the uv , it should also obtain the scale - invariant cosmological perturbations  @xcite .",
    "provided that @xmath3 is a stable ir fixed point of the rg flow , as the universe expands and the hubble expansion rate decreases , @xmath2 approaches @xmath10 and the perturbative treatment of the scalar graviton becomes invalid   limit .",
    "again , this does not necessarily imply loss of predictability but requires nonlinear analysis . ] .",
    "however , the result in subsection [ subsec : continuity ] suggests that the @xmath1 limit may be non - perturbatively continuous .",
    "a natural question is then `` how to convert the scale - invariant cosmological perturbations of the scalar graviton to observables such as cosmic microwave background anisotropies and matter power spectrum ? ''",
    "since hoava s original proposal in january 2009 , several extensions appeared in the literature .",
    "blas , et.al .",
    "@xcite proposed an extension without the projectability condition by including spatial derivatives of the lapse in the action .",
    "more recent proposal by hoava and melby - thompson  @xcite respects the projectability condition but the fundamental symmetry of the theory is larger than the original one .    throughout this article",
    ", we have considered the minimal theory , i.e. the original theory with the projectability condition but without extension of the symmetry . whether this minimal theory is viable is still an open question and crucially depends on non - perturbative nature of the scalar graviton ( see subsection [ subsec : continuity ] ) and properties of the rg flow ( see the condition ( [ eqn : csbound ] ) ) .",
