    "although the one - band hubbard model  @xcite in two dimensions has long been touted as a leading candidate for explaining the basic phenomenon of high temperature superconductivity in copper oxide planes  @xcite , whether the unmodified model provides sufficient features to do this is still controversial  @xcite . in order to clear up this issue , enormous effort is being made to obtain its phase diagram numerically  @xcite .",
    "as the model is doped away from half filling , rich behavior emerges  @xcite , with phases that include antiferromagnetic ordering near half filling , a metallic phase for weak on - site interaction , and a superconducting phase for moderate interaction .",
    "many details of the phase diagram , such as the presence of charge and spin density stripes  @xcite , which have been shown experimentally to play a role in high - temperature superconducting materials  @xcite , are yet to be unequivocally determined .",
    "one of the most important numerical methods used to address these questions is the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg )  @xcite . in particular",
    ", the dmrg can provide unbiased results that are a very useful benchmark and complement for other methods .",
    "while the dmrg has been very successful in treating one - dimensional systems and ladders , its application to two - dimensional systems , such as wider cylinders , is much more challenging  @xcite because the growth of the entanglement between the dmrg blocks , which is generally proportional to the system width for a short - range hamiltonian , leads to exponential growth of the computational cost .",
    "furthermore , the dmrg treats two - dimensional systems by mapping the lattice to an intrinsically one - dimensional matrix product state ( mps )  @xcite , resulting in longer - range effective interaction even for short - range models .",
    "more recently developed tensor network methods such as multi - scale entanglement renormalization ( mera )  @xcite and projected entangled pair states ( peps )  @xcite avoid this restriction in principle by adapting the topology of the tensor network to the entanglement structure of the system .",
    "however , these methods suffer from the fact that the scaling of their computational costs with the dimension of the hilbert space treated is much higher than that of the standard dmrg or other mps - based algorithms .",
    "another ansatz to broaden the applicability of the dmrg for two - dimensional systems is , instead of changing the topology of the underlying network , to change the local basis of the physical model  @xcite .",
    "a change of basis can influence three characteristics that drastically influence the performance of the dmrg : the entanglement between subsystems , the range and structure of the interactions , and the number of quantities that are conserved within the specific representation .",
    "for instance , for translational invariant models , the momentum - space drmg takes advantage of the conserved momentum quantum number and achieves a significant speedup for a fixed size of the truncated hilbert space  @xcite .",
    "however , the scaling of the size of the hilbert space needed to maintain a given fixed accuracy is problematic . in particular",
    ", the block entropy is zero in the noninteracting limit in the momentum - space representation , as the noninteracting fermi sea is a product state .",
    "unfortunately , short - range interactions in real space become long - range in momentum space so that all parts of the system become strongly entangled and the block entropy increases rapidly as the interaction is turned on ; as a result , the entropy scales with the volume of the system for all nonzero interaction strengths .",
    "thus , the computational cost scales exponentially in the _ volume _ of the system , making treating systems of any significant size prohibitively expensive  @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been shown that , by choosing a mixed basis , one can partially take advantage of the performance benefits of the momentum - space dmrg but also retain the beneficial entanglement scaling of the real - space representation  @xcite . our goal",
    "hence it to further explore this approach .",
    "in particular , we apply the hybrid  real - momentum - space dmrg to the two - dimensional hubbard model on a lattice with cylindrical topology .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : model_and_method ] , we express the hubbard model in the hybrid - space representation , discuss the structure of the matrix product operator ( mpo ) , and outline how real - space two - point correlation functions can be calculated in hybrid space . in sec .",
    "[ sec : performance ] , we discuss the computational cost of the hybrid - space dmrg as applied to the two - dimensional hubbard model . in particular , we analyze the scaling of the cpu - time and memory costs as a function of the cylinder width , and verify the results using realistic numerical calculations .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] then describes our study of the ground state of the doped hubbard model at filling @xmath0 and interaction strengths @xmath1 and @xmath2 on cylindrical lattices of width @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "in particular , we address the questions of whether the ground state exhibits stripe structures and whether the pairing correlations are enhanced .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] contains the conclusion .",
    "we investigate the two - dimensional hubbard model with nearest - neighbor hopping and on - site coulomb repulsion defined by the hamiltonian @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes nearest neighbors on a square lattice with lattice sites @xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath9 @xmath10 are creation ( annihilation ) operators for electrons with spin @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the particle - number operator .",
    "we take the lattice geometry to be cylindrical , with cylinder length  @xmath13 , width ( i.e. , circumference )  @xmath14 , a lattice spacing of unity , and periodic or antiperiodic boundary conditions in the transverse direction .",
    "such a geometry is favorable for hybrid  real - momentum - space representation .",
    "we fourier transform in the transverse ( @xmath15- ) direction , i.e. , write @xmath16 and correspondingly for @xmath17 . for periodic boundary conditions ,",
    "the transverse momentum points are given by @xmath18 with integer @xmath19 , whereas , for antiperiodic boundary conditions , @xmath20 .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian in hybrid space ,    @xmath21    consists of three terms , a longitudinal hopping term  ( [ eqn : hybbardtx ] ) , a transverse hopping term  ( [ eqn : hybbardty ] ) with dispersion relation @xmath22 , and a long - range interaction term  ( [ eqn : hybbardu ] ) .",
    "note that the on - site hubbard interaction becomes long - range in the momentum direction , but remains short - range in the real - space direction .    as will be described in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we find states with striped charge and spin density patterns for systems that are moderately doped away from half filling . in order to stabilize and target states with a particular wavelength of the charge - density stripes , @xmath23 , we sometimes apply an additional pinning field @xmath24 to the doped system .",
    "the field couples directly to the local charge density in hybrid space and can be tailored using its amplitude @xmath25 , wavenumber @xmath26 , and phase @xmath27 .",
    "depending on the stability of the target state , we either turn of the pinning field after the initial sweeps of the dmrg , or we keep the field amplitude finite but small throughout the calculation and subtract the contribution of the field to the ground - state energy once the calculation is completed .      in its modern formulation ,",
    "the dmrg algorithm is best described within the framework of mpss and mpos  @xcite . the mps and mpo store the coefficients of the state @xmath28 and hamiltonian @xmath29 as products of matrices associated with each site of the dmrg chain .",
    "the mps and mpo bonds are the contractions of the row and column indices , respectively , of neighboring matrices .",
    "the dimensions of the mps bonds , @xmath30 , are directly related to the number of states kept in the traditional dmrg , and the dimensions of the mpo bonds refer to the operators stored in the left and right block of the dmrg .",
    "the mpo also encodes the rules of how @xmath31 must be calculated within the dmrg - specific block - site - site - block decomposition of the system and how the dmrg blocks are updated during the sweeping process .",
    "therefore , it is crucial to find the optimal mpo representation for a given model and lattice , i.e. , to find the mpo with minimal bond dimension .    roughly speaking , the dimension of each bond of the mpo depends on the number of terms of the hamiltonian acting simultaneously on both sites of the bond . if the hamiltonian is factorizable in an appropriate way , the bond dimension can be minimized by accumulating all interactions between opposing sides of a `` composed '' operator , so that the same interaction can be expressed using fewer terms  @xcite . in this section , we describe how this is done in principle ; the details of the construction of the mpo matrices for the hybrid - space hubbard hamiltonian are given in appendix  [ app : mpo ] .",
    "for the two - dimensional hubbard model in real space , the bond dimension of the optimal mpo is proportional to the system width @xmath32 .",
    "this can be understood as follows :     square lattice .",
    "the bold gray lines depict nearest neighbors on the square lattice , and the blue ( gray ) and red ( gray ) dashed lines depict two possible cuts through the dmrg chain and the corresponding bipartitions of the system .",
    ", width=226 ]    figure  [ fig : mapping ] shows the most common mapping of a two - dimensional square lattice onto the one - dimensional mps / mpo chain ; the one - dimensional path is simply folded over the width of the lattice into two dimensions . therefore , it is clear that , whenever the chain is cut , the number of nearest - neighbor bonds , and thus the number of hopping term in the two - dimensional hubbard model in real space , is proportional to the width of the system . since ( almost )",
    "all of these terms act on different sites of the lattice , the mpo must include an individual channel for each term ; thus its bond dimension is proportional to the system width .    in hybrid space , the situation is more complicated .",
    "in particular , the bond dimension of the mpo depends on where we cut the system : if the cut is between two neighboring rings of the cylinder ( dashed line a in fig .",
    "[ fig : mapping ] ) , only real - space - like hopping terms  ( [ eqn : hybbardtx ] ) are cut , and the bond dimension is again proportional to the system width .",
    "if the cut separates sites of the same ring of the cylinder ( dashed line b in fig .",
    "[ fig : mapping ] ) , the corresponding mpo bond has to carry all the long - range interactions in the term  ( [ eqn : hybbardu ] ) ; for each ring this sum runs over three independent momenta .",
    "if we were to construct the mpo with individual channels for each term , the resulting bond dimension would be proportional to @xmath33 .",
    "fortunately , for a given bipartition , the sum  ( [ eqn : hybbardu ] ) can be factorized to reduce the effective number of terms as follows : for fixed @xmath34 , the part of  ( [ eqn : hybbardu ] ) for which the annihilation and creation operators are in separated parts of the system can be rewritten as @xmath35 with composed operators @xmath36 analogous steps can be carried out for all possible distributions of creation and annihilation operators of both spin species onto the two subsystems , resulting in a formulation in which the total number of terms connecting the two parts of the system is @xmath37 .",
    "thus , without approximation , we obtain an mpo in which the dimension of each bond is proportional to the system width , just as in real space .",
    "this approach was introduced for the momentum - space dmrg in ref .",
    "the technique can be applied to other models as long as the hamiltonian is factorizable .",
    "the hybrid - space hamiltonian and the optimized mpo for the fermionic hofstadter model are described in detail in ref .",
    "similar optimizations of mpos have also been carried out for other systems with long - range interactions , such as the quantum chemical hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "the exact bond dimension for the hubbard model in hybrid space varies with the position of the cut in the cylinder , whereas in real space it is constant within the bulk of the system .",

    "the equal - time spin , charge , and pair - field correlation functions are defined as @xmath50 with @xmath51 where @xmath52 measures the local spin , @xmath53 is the local charge density , and @xmath54 is the creation operator for a pair of spin up and down particles on sites @xmath55 and @xmath56 .    measuring two - point real - space correlation functions in hybrid space",
    "raises the same issues as implementing the mpo of the hamiltonian : applying the fourier transformation  ( [ eqn : fourier ] ) to the correlation functions  ( [ eqn : correlationfunctions ] ) introduces sums over multiple momenta similar to term  ( [ eqn : hybbardu ] ) .",
    "these sums can again be factorized analogously to eq .",
    "( [ eqn : hubbardhybrid ] ) : the pair - field correlation functions in hybrid space can be written as @xmath57 with composed operators @xmath58 and corresponding annihilation operators @xmath59 .",
    "the spin and charge correlation functions can be treated analogously .",
    "thus , the correlation functions  ( [ eqn : correlationfunctions ] ) can be measured without changing the scaling of the total computational cost of the algorithm .",
    "here we start by emphasizing that the dimension of the mps bonds required to obtain a given accuracy scales exponentially with the block entropy ; thus , the scaling of the block entropy with system parameters and lattice size has a decisive influence on the performance for fixed accuracy . for two - dimensional systems to which the entropy area law  @xcite applies ,",
    "the entropy is proportional to system width @xmath14 .",
    "the resulting exponential scaling of the computational cost with system width is a fundamental limitation of the hybrid - space dmrg as well as of the real - space dmrg and all known mps - based algorithms .    in this section ,",
    "we at first neglect the variation in the required bond dimension @xmath30 on model parameters and lattice size and analyze the scaling of the computational cost of the real - space and hybrid - space dmrg for fixed @xmath30 .",
    "we thus estimate the performance gain of the hybrid - space relative to the real - space representation . we then compare our estimate to measurements of the actual runtime and memory usage for typical calculations and finally come back to the issue of the dependence of the relative accuracy of the hybrid - space and real - space representations on bond dimension @xmath30 .",
    "the majority of the computational cost in the dmrg algorithm comes from applying the hamiltonian to a state , @xmath60 ; this is the fundamental step in iterative eigensolvers such as the lanczos or davidson algorithms  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we examine the scaling of the operations required for this operation with the dimension of the physical lattice sites , @xmath61 , cylinder width @xmath14 , cylinder length @xmath13 , and mps bond dimension @xmath30 based on the structures of the mps and mpo used . the computational costs of other operations , e.g. , changing the active sites of the dmrg in the sweeping process , benefit from the hybrid - space representation in the same way .",
    "we assume that the bond dimension of the mpo is proportional to @xmath14 in both real - space and hybrid - space representations , as is the case for the hubbard model ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : hybrid - space_mpo ] ) . in our estimate",
    ", we neglect the possibility of exploiting the conservation of spin and charge quantum numbers , as it would have the exact same effect on the computational costs in both representations .    in the real - space representation",
    ", one lanczos step then requires @xmath62 multiplications of @xmath63 matrices , resulting in @xmath64 operations per lanczos step and @xmath65 operations per dmrg sweep , with a fixed number of lanczos steps per dmrg step , @xmath66 .",
    "the corresponding memory costs are @xmath67 for the @xmath66-dimensional krylov space and @xmath68 for the left and right dmrg block in the current block - site - site - block configuration .",
    "next , we analyze the scaling of the costs in the hybrid - space representation under the assumption that the hybrid - space mps has the same total bond dimension @xmath30 . since the hamiltonian ( [ eqn : hubbardhybrid ] ) conserves the transverse momentum quantum number , every matrix of the mps can be written in a block - diagonal form with @xmath14 blocks of size @xmath69 with @xmath70 , where every block corresponds to one momentum sector .",
    "therefore , the computational costs reduce to @xmath71 per lanczos step and @xmath72 per dmrg sweep , and the memory costs become @xmath73 for the krylov space and @xmath74 for the dmrg blocks .",
    "a side - by - side comparison of all costs is given in table  [ tab : computational_costs ] .",

    "the local operators must be arranged according to their momentum and the momenta of the column and row channels , i.e. , the combined momentum of the row channel and the operator must match the momentum of the column channel ( modulo system width ) . precisely , if we label the new channels with increasing momenta , an operator with momentum @xmath182 is placed on the @xmath182-th upper and @xmath183-th lower diagonal . for example , a creation operator on a site with momentum @xmath184 within a width-6 cylinder becomes a @xmath185 sub - matrix @xmath186 \\ , .\\ ] ] the resulting mpo is indeed momentum - conserving , and its structure encodes the factorization described in sec .",

    "this completes the steps that are necessary to assemble a complete mpo for the hybrid - space hamiltonian .",
    "the mpos for the different parts of the hamiltonian can be combined by simply using distinct sets of channels for each part , except for the initial and final channels . in total , one initial channel , one final channel , @xmath187 channels for the longitudinal hopping  ( [ eqn : hybbardtx ] ) , and @xmath188 channels for the nonlocal hubbard interaction  ( [ eqn : hybbardu ] ) are required , resulting in a total virtual bond dimension of @xmath189 .",
