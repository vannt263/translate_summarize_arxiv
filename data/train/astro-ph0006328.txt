    "a significant fraction of early type galaxies ( ellipticals and s0s ) contain some cool interstellar medium ( ism ) including neutral gas and dust ( jura et al .",
    "1987 , knapp et al .",

    "many ellipticals have been detected by the x - ray emission of hot gas ( roberts et al .",
    "1991 ) , and many in the  and co lines indicating cold - neutral medium ( lees et al .",
    "1991 , wiklind , combes & henkle 1995 ) , and through dust obscuration ( sadler & gerhard 1985 , goudfrooij et al . 1994a",
    "the environment in the ellipticals may lead to different equilibrium physical conditions in the various phases of the ism because of the presence of hot x - ray gas and a higher ratio of stellar radiation compared to the cool gas and dust .",
    "but the iras colors in 60 and 100 micron emission indicate cold dust with temperatures comparable to found in spirals .",
    "we observed four elliptical / s0 galaxies with the infrared space observatory ( kessler et al .",
    "1996 ) to study the physical conditions in the gas and dust in these galaxies .",
    "these galaxies are part of a large sample of normal star - forming galaxies spanning a range of morphologies , infrared luminosities , fir colors ( @xmath4 ) and fir - to - blue ratio .",
    "iso - cam ( cesarsky et al . 1996 ) images at 7 and 15 microns are used to determine the distribution of mid - ir emission ( section 3 ) and hence its origin .",

    "cam was set to @xmath13/pixel , and the raster was made up of @xmath14 pointings separated by @xmath15 , or 13.5 pixels in each direction , allowing for better spatial sampling . at each pointing in the raster scan we integrated for 50 seconds in each band : @xmath16 second exposures at 15 @xmath0 , and @xmath17 seconds at 7 @xmath0 .",

    "this may not be the case for ellipticals given that the ism - to - stellar ratio is low .",
    "a significant part of the emission at 12 microns could be from photospheres and circumstellar dust ( knapp , gunn and wynn - williams 1992 ) , although sauvage and thuan ( 1994 ) have argued that the iras color - color relation ( helou 1986 ) holds for early type as well as for late type galaxies indicating a similar origin from ism .",
    "hot dust near an active nucleus ( e.g. agn ) can also be a major contributer in some cases .",

    "the decrease in @xmath19/@xmath18 in the outer parts of the galaxy is due to different proportions of photospheric and ism contributions , with the photospheres having a lower @xmath19/@xmath18 ratio ( i.e. , bluer emission ) .",

    "the far - infrared continuum reflects the cooling , and thus the total heating of the dust grains . for galaxies with the most active star - formation and warm dust and hence most intense radiation fields , the dust grains become positively charged making the photoelectric heating less efficient .",

    "in spirals , [ cii ] and [ oi ] are the major coolant of warm , neutral gas and most of the heating is by photoelectrons from dust grains ( watson 1972 ) .",
    "the potential barrier to photoejection from neutral grains is approximately 6 ev ( bakes & tielens 1994 ) , or higher if the grains are positively charged .",
    "this means that only photons shortward of @xmath120 contribute to heating of the gas .",
    "old stellar populations ( pne , hb , pagb stars ) in es / s0s produce enough ionizing flux shortward of @xmath121 to explain the h@xmath1 emission seen ( rose & tinsley 1974 , binette et al . 1994 ) .",

    "but what is the magnitude of that contribution ?    to answer that question we estimate photoelectric gas heating by uv photons from old stellar populations .",
    "we use gissel ( bruzual and charlot 1993 ) stellar population models of instantaneous burst of ages 10 and 13 gyr to calculate the uv spectra of early type galaxies .",
    "the mass of each galaxy is normalized to match the b - band flux within the lws beam of @xmath89 .",
    "an upper limit to the gas heating rate is calculated by assuming that the work function of the grains is 6 ev and the yield of photoelectrons heating process is @xmath122 ( tielens & hollenbach 1985 ) .",
    "this is an upper limit on the heating and a lower limit on the uv required because it neglects the positive charging of the grains by photoelectric process , which raises the potential barrier for ejecting electrons off grains , therefore requiring even more energetic photons .",
    "we neglect here the contribution of negatively charged grains , which have an ionization potential as low as 2 ev , because they are estimated to contribute less than 10% of the heating ( spaans et al .",
    "the total power that goes into heating the gas is given by :    @xmath123    in the above equation @xmath124 are the number of photons at frequency @xmath125 and @xmath126 is the fraction of photons absorbed by the dust .",
    "@xmath126 should be less than unity given the low ratio of ism to stars .",
    "@xmath126 is estimated from the observed values of @xmath127 and using a standard extinction curve with the spectral energy distribution from stellar population models .",
