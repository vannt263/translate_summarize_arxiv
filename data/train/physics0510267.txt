    "however , when many electrons with higher orbital angular momentum are involved in one subshell , the calculation process using this theoretical method still is a challenging work .",
    "the current feasible methods usually take several steps of simplification , such as firstly using branching rules for reduction  @xcite , and then using ll - coupling scheme .",
    "nevertheless , we still have to work hard to calculate a big table of the ls terms corresponding to young patterns of one column ( the situation is similar to use gelfand basis set  @xcite ) , and many ll - couplings .",
