    "photometric variability was one of the original , defining characteristics of the class of objects that were later determined to be stars in the process of formation , or young stellar objects ( ysos ) @xcite . while optical and near - ir variability studies have demonstrated the relation between accretion shocks and hotspots on the surface of rotating ysos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , observations at longer wavelengths offer another perspective to study cooler circumstellar disks and envelopes surrounding nascent stars .",
    "in particular , recent mid - ir photometric and spectroscopic time series of ysos with the _ spitzer _ space telescope @xcite have begun to shed light on inner disk structures , identifying both inner disk warps and ` clouds ' in the disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "elaborate models offer satisfying explanations to the observed time series @xcite .",
    "similar photometric variability studies are a lot sparser in the literature at longer wavelengths ( @xmath3 m ) , mostly due to the difficult access to this wavelength domain .",
    "@xcite report on a 200% flux variation of ssv@xmath213 in ngc@xmath21333 over a two - year period using the kuiper airborne observatory .",
    "@xcite and @xcite analyze the 1 - 300@xmath0 m variability of the star sv@xmath2cep over two years , and they invoke a growing warp at the inner edge of the disk , which leads to the shadowing of the outer disk , to reproduce the observations across the entire wavelength range .",
    "based on reprocessed isophot observations @xcite , @xcite present the far - ir fading of the pre - main sequence star oo@xmath2serpentis after it went into outburst , and they show that the @xmath4 m flux changed by a factor of 8 over a period of 11  years .",
    "most sources targeted by these monitoring programs are disk - bearing ysos .    in this article , we present the first sensitive wide - field far - ir photometric monitoring of protostars which significantly extends the statistics on yso variability monitoring in this wavelength regime and evolutionary stage .",
    "we recently completed the first set of time series observations of the orion nebula cluster ( onc ) with the pacs instrument @xcite onboard the _ herschel _ space observatory @xcite . during the first two - month visibility window",
    ", we obtained six observations of a single field centered on the integral - shaped filament located north of the onc , which contains hundreds of ysos .",
    "in addition , this field has been monitored in the optical @xcite , and in the mid - ir with _",
    "spitzer _ as part of the ysovar program @xcite , thus making it the largest yso variability database to date .",
    "we first describe the observations and data reduction in section  [ sec : method ] , then we give a detailed account of the photometric measurements and present the light - curves extracted from the time series observations .",
    "finally we discuss the possible origin of the observed variability in section  [ sec : result ] .",
    "we use the _ _ herschel/__pacs photometer simultaneously in the blue and red channels , operating at 70 and 160@xmath0 m respectively , to measure photometric time series of ysos in the onc .",
    "herschel _",
    "ot1 observing program is designed to make the best use of the observatory while accommodating the constraints dictated by the need for precise photometric monitoring .",
    "the building block of our program is a 30-minute single - direction scan map observation covering a 35@xmath135  field .",
    "this scheme of scanning a relatively large area that contains several ysos was preferred over repeated observations of individual sources because of the prohibitive telescope overheads that this would entail .",
    "the targeted field was chosen to contain as many ysovar - monitored protostars as possible , with over 100  known in total @xcite .",
    "this building block is then repeatedly scheduled with absolute timing constraints to cover several 2-months visibility windows spread over a period of nearly 2  years . moreover , within each pacs - photometer observing campaign , which lasts 2.5-days , our observations are scheduled at least 12  hours after the end of the cryo - cooler recycling and switch - on of the detectors .",
    "this is to ensure the highest thermal and electrical stability possible required for photometric variability monitoring .",
    "in addition , considering that map - making algorithms rely on scan - direction redundancy to filter out instrumental drifts from the extended emission present in the field ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we require that the scan direction of consecutive observations are rotated by 90  with respect to the previous one",
    ". the scan - direction redundancy is further increased by the secular rotation of the spacecraft roll angle along its orbit ( @xmath510  between consecutive observations ) .",
    "this observing strategy thus allows a very good rejection of instrumental drifts when combining single - epoch observations , and consequently the reconstruction of artifact - free extended emission structures ] ( see figure  [ fig : maps ] ) .",
    "we retrieve the raw data from the _ herschel _ science archive and process individual observations to obtain calibrated data cubes ( _ level@xmath21 _ frames ) using the pacs standard pipeline with the _ herschel _ interactive processing environment ( hipe version  7.0  1931 , * ? ? ?",
    "we correct the bolometer signals for non - linearities based on pre - launch calibration measurements @xcite .",
    "we also modify the frame s astrometry to correct for telescope pointing errors ( up to 3  in the sixth visit ) .",
    "we create maps from individual single - direction scan observations using the standard approach of highpass filtering the bolometer timelines and projecting the data cube on regular grids with pixel sizes of 1  and 2  in the blue and red pacs channels , respectively .",
    "we use a filter width twice as long as a scan leg ( 2000 readouts ) , and we mask bright regions prior to applying the filter to minimize shadowing artifacts along the scan direction .",
    "this filtering process alters to some extent the largest spatial scales in the map but preserves the signal at the scale of point sources .",
    "the source photometry is measured from these single - epoch maps ( see section  [ sec : photometry ] ) .    in parallel",
    ", we export individual level@xmath21 frames out of hipe to be combined by the idl - based map - making algorithm scanamorphos @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : maps ] presents the maps resulting from the combination of the six epochs observed during the first visibility window between february 26 , 2011 and april 10 , 2011 .",
    "most of the ysos in this field are situated along the orion@xmath2a molecular clouds omc-1 , -2 and -3 , north of the onc .",
    "a small area of 10  radius is saturated in both maps at the location of the trapezium cluster where the signal reaches @xmath6mjy@xmath7sr@xmath8 and @xmath9mjy.sr@xmath8 in the blue and red channels , respectively .",
    "the orion bar is visible to the south east of the trapezium cluster .",
    "a detailed discussion of the extended emission structure in this field is beyond the scope of this letter and will be treated in a subsequent article .",
    "it is a difficult task to disentangle intrinsic source variability and photometric errors based solely on 6  data points , especially for faint sources .",
    "nevertheless , considering the criterions we used in selecting reliable light curves ( cf section  [ sec : photometry ] ) , we expect that flux variations greater than @xmath510% can be confidently attributed to the intrinsic variability of the observed sources .",
    "we find that 8  sources out of 17  show peak - to - peak flux variations higher than @xmath510% .",
    "the left column of figure  [ fig : lightcurves ] presents a sample of such light curves . the case of hoy@xmath2j053522.27 - 050116.8",
    "( top left plot ) is of particular interest with its sine - like light curve that shows an amplitude of nearly 20% .",
    "the smooth shape of the light curve suggests that the photometric uncertainties are very small for this source .",
    "in addition both 70@xmath0 m and 160@xmath0 m light curves show the same trend , which strengthens further our confidence that this source is indeed variable in the far - ir .",
    "the object hoy@xmath2j053524.23 - 050831.9 also shows strong variations in excess of 20% in just over 2  weeks . for comparison ,",
    "we present in figure  [ fig : ysovarlightcurves ] spitzer light curves obtained in 2009 as part of the ysovar program @xcite , and it appears that objects variable in the far - ir tend to be also variable in the mid - ir ( left column of figures  [ fig : lightcurves ] and  [ fig : ysovarlightcurves ] ) .",
    "however the shape of herschel and spitzer light curves are not directly comparable since they are not contemporaneous and they have significantly different observing cadences .",
    "the remaining 9  sources that have reliable light curves show flux variations in the 5  10% range .",
    "although those sources exhibit variations below the 10% threshold , we can not exclude that they might as well be intrinsically variable in the far - ir .",
    "in fact , based on the herschel dataset currently available , we are only sensitive to variations with timescales in the range 10  50  days , and we miss all variations on shorter and longer timescales .",
    "for instance , the light curve of hoy  j053524.71 - 051030.6 does not satisfy our variability criterion according to its 70@xmath0 m flux only , however its spitzer light curve shows clear variability in the mid - ir with a period of @xmath54  days ( bottom right plot of figure  [ fig : ysovarlightcurves ] ) .",
    "if the mid- and far - ir variability had the same origin , and thus showed similar timescales at both wavelengths , then the sampling frequency of 10  days would not be appropriate to detect such rapid variations in herschel bands .",
    "+ although ysos have been monitored on daily to yearly timescales from the optical to the mid - ir and in all evolutionary stages ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the variability parameter - space is still sparsely sampled in the far - ir .",
    "this is particularly true for high cadence monitoring and embedded protostars , as most far - ir monitoring programs have targeted outbursting ysos with fading timescales of several years ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the present herschel time - series observations thus fill in this parameter - space gap , and they show that the far - ir emission , which is a good tracer of the internal luminosity of protostars @xcite , can vary noticeably on timescales as short as a couple of weeks .",
    "this is orders of magnitude shorter than the dynamical timescales of the far - ir emitting material that orbits at hundreds to thousands of aus from the central protostar .",
    "such short timescales indicate that the mechanism(s ) responsible for the observed variability occurs on smaller spatial scales , either at the surface or within the disk , or close to the central protostar ( r @xmath10au ) where timescales are consistent with weekly to monthly timescales .",
    "non - steady accretion likely plays a role in the observed variability .",
    "* and references therein ) argue that the typical accretion luminosity observed in protostars implies an accretion rate considerably lower than the predicted time - average infall rate in ysos .",
    "this ` luminosity problem ' can be explained if infalling material accretes sporadically causing major accretion events that are sufficiently short - lived so that protostars are usually observed in quiescence .",
    "numerical models of @xcite manage to reproduce these accretion events for classi and classii ysos when disk fragments fall onto the central protostar .",
    "such energetic outbursts have been observed in fu - orionis - type objects with typical timescales of 1  10  years @xcite .",
    "similar events might occur on shorter temporal and less energetic scales .",
    "for instance , @xcite measured accretion rates from pa@xmath11 and br@xmath12 observations , and they find that the accretion rate of the class@xmath2ii object  lrll  31 varies by a factor of five , with the largest changes occurring on a weekly timescale .",
    "these episodic accretion events could be pictured as knotty filaments of gas funneling from the inner region of the circumstellar disk to the central star , likely through magnetic field lines @xcite , and releasing packets of energy as the clumps hit the surface of the protostar . for embedded protostars",
    ", the energetic photons generated in the accretion shock are reprocessed by the dense and dusty surrounding envelop , and they eventually escape the protostar in the far - ir regime .",
    "the accretion luminosity variations that originate from episodic accretion events in the central region of a protostar propagate outwards and temporarily warm up the envelop , which in turn leads to detectable far - ir flux variations .",
    "the typical timescale for photons to reach the far - ir emitting material in the envelop ( located at @xmath13au from the central star ) is roughly the light travel time , which is a few days , similar to the typical timescales observed in the light curves of figure  [ fig : lightcurves ] .",
    "the alternative scenario proposed by @xcite might also cause a measurable far - ir variability in ysos .",
    "it consists in a variable scale height of the disk inner edge that casts a shadow on the outer disk , thus cooling down the mid- and far - ir - emitting disk .",
    "this non - axisymetric disk model was used to reproduce the mid - ir variability observed in the yso lrll  31 , and it can potentially give constraints on the inner disk structure .",
    "in a subsequent work , @xcite have tested various models that may lead to variable scale heights of the inner edge of the disk , with origins ranging from variable accretion , perturbations by a companion , winds , and the influence of magnetic fields .",
    "although lrll  31 is more evolved than most objects observed in the present study , a similar mechanism could well explain the variations of the classii source hoyj053530.33045938.6 ( bottom left plot in figure  [ fig : lightcurves ] ) .",
    "however , contemporaneous near - ir observations would be necessary to confirm the expected anti - correlated flux variations with respect to the far - ir light curves .",
    "+ the first 6  epochs of our monitoring program have demonstrated that protostellar emission can vary on relatively short timescales in the far - ir .",
    "furthermore we find that the fraction of variable protostars in our sample is relatively high ( @xmath1440% ) , though difficult to ascertain based on sparse 70@xmath0 m light curves only .",
    "for a better sampling of the light curves , we have requested a higher observing cadence for the second orion visibility window , and we have extended the initial span of the monitoring program with the last observations scheduled for autumn  2012 , thus covering a period of nearly 2  years .",
    "these additional observations , with refined photometric measurements and a detailed sed modeling , should increase the number of variability detections and help us understand the nature of these objects and the mechanism responsible for the observed variability . a spectroscopic follow - up with herschel / pacs",
    "is also scheduled for 2012 to monitor accretion activity in a couple of variable sources with atomic and molecular lines , particularly [ oi ] , [ cii ] , co and h@xmath15o , already observed as part of the hops program @xcite . +",
    "this work is based on observations made with herschel , a european space agency cornerstone mission with significant participation by nasa .",
    "support for this work was provided by nasa through an award issued by jpl / caltech .",
    "this research has made use of nasa s astrophysics data system .",
