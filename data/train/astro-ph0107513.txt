    "stellar evolution and dynamical hardening of compact binaries within globulars lead to mass transfer and accretion onto the compact object , which is visible especially in the x - ray regime",
    ". thus x - ray studies of globular clusters are particularly effective at studying both compact objects and compact binaries .",
    "successful searches for lmxb optical counterparts have been undertaken for several clusters ( deutsch et al .",
    "1998b and references therein , homer et al .",
    "however , of the 12 globular cluster lmxbs in the galaxy ( cf .",
    "grindlay 1993 ) , at least 6 remain optically unidentified  those in terzan 1 , 2 , 5 , and 6 , liller 1 , and ngc 6652 . of the separate population of low - luminosity x - ray sources (",
    "hertz & grindlay 1983 ) , many sources have now been positively identified with cvs , as in ngc 6397 ( edmonds et al .",
    "1999 and references therein ) and with cvs , millisecond pulsars , and by draconis binaries in 47 tucanae ( grindlay et al .",
    "2001 , and references therein ) .",
    "the globular cluster ngc 6652 includes one previously known lmxb , x1832 - 330 .",
    "this cluster is at galactocentric radius 2 kpc and 9.0@xmath70.4 kpc from the sun , and is 11.7@xmath71.6 gyr old , using @xmath8=15.15 , @xmath9=0.12 ( chaboyer 2000 ) .",
    "the lmxb was probably detected by _",
    "heao 1 _ at a low level ( hertz & wood 1985 ) .",
    "it was securely detected by rosat during the all - sky survey ( predehl et al .",
    "1991 ) , again during pointed rosat observations ( johnston et al .",
    "1996 ) , and in type 1 x - ray bursts by both asca and bepposax ( int zand et al .",
    "1998 , mukai & smale 2000 ) .",
    "a search for the optical counterpart of the lmxb was undertaken by deutsch , margon , and anderson ( 1998 ; hereafter dma98 ) , unfortunately not including the entire rosat error circle for the lmxb .",
    "they were able to identify a plausible candidate ( star 49 ) ; however , it is located 2.3 @xmath10 from the rosat position , and is identified here with a lower - luminosity source .",
    "this paper presents observations with _",
    "chandra _ as part of a campaign to measure precise positions for the remaining unidentified lmxbs .",
    "we also use _ hubble space telescope _ archival images to identify optical counterparts .",
    "we observed ngc 6652 on may 23 , 2000 with the high resolution camera  imager ( hrc - i ) camera ( murray et al . 2000 ) on the chandra x - ray observatory ( cxo ) .",
    "the chandra mirrors give well - defined point - spread functions of half - power diameter 0.76(jerius et al .",

    "the cxc source detection routine wavdetect ( dobrzycki et al .",
    "1999 ) was used to detect sources in the exposure - corrected central field ( 4radius circle ) .",
    "the pros variability test vartst was applied to each source .",
    "most of the hst data analyzed here ( except for brief references to @xmath13 , and @xmath14 data ) are archival data from the september 1997 wfpc2 observations of chaboyer ( go-6517 ) . under this program , an orbit of short ( 23s ) f555w and ( 20s )",
    "f814w images were obtained at two different pointings , followed by an orbit of 12 long ( 160s ) f555w images and an orbit of 12 long ( 160s ) f814w images .",
    "the second and third orbits were obtained at a fixed pointing with the center of ngc 6652 placed in the center of the pc .",
    "the 12 deep f555w and f814w images were cleaned of cosmic rays and combined into single images .",
    "aperture photometry and psf - fitting were used to derive instrumental m@xmath15 and m@xmath16 magnitudes , which were then converted into @xmath17 and @xmath18 using the prescription given in holtzman et al .",
    "the precision of the psf - fitting photometry along the main sequence was inferior to that obtained for aperture photometry , but was much less affected by crowding , especially near cluster center .",

    "we were unable to find counterparts for these sources , and ignore them in this paper .",
    "we detect 4 sources within 30of the cluster center , including the bright lmxb x1832 - 330 , hereafter source a ( figure 1 ) ; the others we label b , c , and d. all four sources are well - detected : a has 9140 counts , b has 75 counts , c and d have 15 and 16 respectively , with formal significances greater than 6 @xmath10 in each case .",
    "we consider all four of these sources to be associated with the cluster , since the probability that any of 6 sources within a 4circle would fall within 30of the cluster center is 9% .",

    "is detected in the hrc - i data at a position 0.8from the position of star 49 ( in the hst guide star catalog frame ) .",
    "star 49 was suggested by dma98 as the counterpart for the lmxb , which we detect 17away .",
    "star 49 has measured @xmath19 ( dma98 ) , and shows variability of 1 magnitude , possibly with a 43.6 minute periodic modulation ( deutsch et al 2000 ) .",

    "hrc 0.6 absolute positional errors in quadrature gives a 1.71@xmath10 error circle .",
    "the 1.7error circle is not crowded ( being @xmath22 core radii from the center ) , so we confidently identify star 49 with source b.    by matching the go-6517 and hrc coordinates for star 49 and source b , we performed a shift of the hrc coordinate frame by -0.04263 sec in ra , -0.609 in dec .",
    "the hst images then allowed the identification of @xmath23 excess optical counterparts for sources a and c within 0.01and 0.3of the corrected hrc positions .",
    "the derived x - ray and optical parameters of sources a through d are given in table 1 .",
    "figure 2 shows the @xmath17 vs @xmath23 cmds resulting from psf - fitting to both hst pc and wf data .",
    "the likely optical counterparts for sources a , b and c are shown , as are some other stars ( shown by circles , all are distant from x - ray positions ) confirmed to be blue objects by visual examination of the @xmath17 and @xmath18 images .",
    "figure 3 shows the combined @xmath17 and @xmath18 time series for sources a and c ( the time series for source b is reported in dma98 ) .",
    "a zeropoint correction was applied to the i data so that @xmath24=0 , and the errors were calculated from the median time series rms for stars within 0.25 mag ( typically 150400 stars ) of either source a or c. best - fitting sinusoids have been overplotted showing possible periodicities for a and c.",
    "the blue counterpart for the lmxb has @xmath25 , @xmath26 ; this is 0.4 mag above the turnoff and 0.4 mag blueward of the main sequence in @xmath23 , similar to other known lmxbs .",
    "our suggested counterpart of source a is partly cut off in archival hst u images , possibly explaining why it was not identified in dma98 .",
    "however , the peak pixel value at the edge of the chip clearly shows that this star is uv - bright .    a time series analysis of the @xmath17 and @xmath18 exposures shows a clear 0.08-magnitude variability , with rms variation 4.4 @xmath10 and 6.2 @xmath10 in @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively , where @xmath10 is defined as the median rms variation of stars within 0.25 mag of the star .",
    "possible periods of 0.92 , or 2.22 hours ( or 4.44 hours for ellipsoidal variations ) , as well as some nonperiodic flickering , are observed ( see figure 3 ) . the false alarm probability ( fap ; cf .",
    "scargle 1982 ) is @xmath27 for each period individually , although the short temporal coverage does not allow us to distinguish between these periods .",
    "we suggest one of these is the orbital period of the system , leading to an orbital separation of ( for m@xmath28=1.6@xmath29 ) either @xmath30 cm , @xmath31 cm , or @xmath32 cm , respectively ( frank et al .  1992 ) . either a low - mass m dwarf or a white dwarf would be a plausible secondary , depending on which period is the real one .",
    "the absolute magnitude @xmath33 of the optical counterpart is comparable to those of ultracompact ( @xmath34 hr ) lmxbs in globular clusters : 3.7 for x1820 - 303 in ngc 6624 , and 5.6 for x1850 - 087 in ngc 6712 ( van paradijs & mcclintock 1994 ) .",

    "2 ) , @xmath35log@xmath36 , where @xmath36 is @xmath37 . for @xmath38=3.7 , we find log@xmath39 to @xmath40 for periods from 0.92 to 4.4 hours .",
    "all three proposed periods place this lmxb within the scatter of known lmxbs .",
    "the hrc - i has no spectral resolution , yet our flux determination depends upon the assumed spectrum . by using a partial covering absorber ( @xmath41 covered by @xmath42 @xmath43 ) , and a power - law with photon index 1.86 , mukai and smale ( 2000 ) fit both their asca gis spectrum and the second rosat pspc spectrum .",
    "from their recorded flux we derive @xmath44(2 - 8 kev)= @xmath45 in the asca range , or @xmath44(0.5 - 2.5 kev)= @xmath46 ergs s@xmath4 extrapolated to the rosat range .",
    "the fitted partial covering absorber suggests variability in the @xmath47 column , which would also explain the differences in spectral fitting by rosat data ( johnston et al .",
    "1996 , verbunt et al .",
    "bepposax observations ( int zand et al",
    ". , 1998 ) revealed type i bursts ( observed also by mukai & smale ) , and persistent emission at @xmath44(2 - 8 kev)= @xmath48 ergs s@xmath4 ( adjusted for the change in distance to 9.0 kpc , without absorption ) .",
    "the low - level emission they observed agrees with both rosat observations of low - level luminosity extended to the harder band , for a photon index of 1.86 .",
    "we use a power - law spectrum with photon index 1.86 , and a range of @xmath47 between @xmath49 and @xmath50 , the first being the average cluster value and the second the maximum value for a from asca observations .",
    "these give intrinsic luminosity ranges of @xmath44(0.5 - 2.5 kev ) @xmath51 to 1.1@xmath52 ergs s@xmath4 , similar to the rosat observations in 1990 and 1992 ( verbunt et al . 1995 , johnston et al .  1996 ) , and @xmath44(2 - 8 kev ) @xmath53 to @xmath54 ergs s@xmath4 , comparable to the asca and bepposax observations in 1996 - 7 ( mukai & smale 2000 , int zand et al .",
    "we see no significant variability during the 1.6 ksec observation .",
    "mukai and smale note that no eclipses have been seen , and that we directly observe the neutron star during the type i bursts , ruling out a high - inclination geometry .",
    "this suggests that the optical variability may be due to orbital variations of the heated face of the secondary .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of source b , @xmath44(0.5 - 2.5 kev ) @xmath55 for a 1 kev bremsstrahlung spectrum , suggests a quiescent lmxb since cvs generally do not reach this luminosity ( verbunt et al .",
    "source b is the only source to show clear x - ray variability , at the 95% level in the cramer - von mises test ( daniel 1990 ) .",
    "it is possible that this source is responsible for the type i bursts seen with asca and bepposax ( int zand et al .",
    "1998 , mukai & smale 2000 ) , since neither telescope could resolve source b from the bright lmxb , source a , only 17distant .",
    "dma98 identified star 49 as the bright lmxb counterpart based on u - b excess ( @xmath56 , 1.2 mags blueward of the main sequence [ ms ] ) , and later ( in deutsch et al .",
    "2000 ) added weight to the identification by discovering @xmath57 magnitude flickering and a possible period of 43.6 minutes .",
    "we confirm the variability , at 24 @xmath58 and 21 @xmath59 , and identify the same possible optical period , but with an fap of 0.027 , the least significant fap of the power spectrum peaks for the three optical counterparts .",
    "if the 43.6-minute period is the real binary period , a main sequence companion is ruled out since the implied orbital separation for a 2 @xmath29 system is @xmath60 cm , less than the radius of even an m2 star , implying a double - degenerate system .",
    "however , this identification suffers a problem in that star 49 falls onto the ms in @xmath23 ( see figure 2 , table 1 ) .",
    "the system also lies on the ms in an instrumental @xmath17 vs. @xmath61 cmd from further archival analysis .",
    "the ms colors suggest that light from a main - sequence secondary is dominant in @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and that the weak accretion disk provides the @xmath14 excess ( see dma98 ) .",
    "however , this interpretation can not explain why both @xmath17 and @xmath18 vary in tandem by one magnitude ( deutsch et al .",
    "2000 , figure 1 ) without invoking eclipses , nor does it explain the large flickering ( which generally implies a bright , blue disk ) .",
    "we considered the possibility that the identification suffers source confusion ( background or foreground stars contributing @xmath17 , @xmath18 light ) , but there is no evidence for blending in the hst image .",
    "we consider it most likely that the 43.6 minute period is spurious , but the 1-mag variability remains a mystery .",
    "the suggested counterpart of source c lies only 3 \" from the cluster center , @xmath62=18:35:45.66 , @xmath63=-32:59:26.5 ( j2000 ) , from grindlay et al .",
    "2001 ( in preparation ) .",
    "this is within one core radius ( 4.2 , harris 1996 ) .",
    "its @xmath23 color , @xmath38 , and @xmath64 ( see table 1 , figure 2 ) suggest a cv , since light from field cvs is usually dominated by the hot accretion disk throughout the optical range .",
    "although both the x - ray luminosity and @xmath38 are bright for a cv , bright magnetic cvs ( ips ; see barrett et al .  1999 ) , or cvs in outburst ,",
    "reach this range .",
    "archival go-6095 hst wfpc2 data shows c at similar brightness and color , and it is unlikely that we have caught c in outburst twice .",
    "a quiescent lmxb is the other plausible interpretation .",
    "however , the accretion disk in a low - system is expected to be truncated due to a mass transfer instability leading to an adaf flow , and the light from the secondary should be dominant for @xmath23 .",
    "the optical time series for source c show clear variability ( see figure 3 ) , at the 5.0 @xmath65 and 7.6 @xmath66 levels . we find a possible periodicity of 44.4 minutes ( close to the 48-minute hst half - period ) , semi - amplitude 0.16 magnitudes , and false alarm probability of @xmath67 ( @xmath57% ) .",
    "three other stars within a 3@xmath10 error circle ( indicated by crosses in figure 2 ) show no variability at the @xmath68 level .",
    "the time series for c shows significant flickering , which might combine with the periodic hst window to generate the possible 44.4 minute periodicity .",
    "this period is disturbingly close to the suggested 43.6 minute period for source b , indicating that both periods may be spurious .",
    "the final source , d , lies less than 0.4from the cluster core ( as given above ) .",
    "the x - ray flux shows no significant variability . a bright blue star ( @xmath17=17.4 , @xmath23=0.2 ) is located 0.7away from the corrected x - ray position ( see figure 1 ) , but shows no variability ( significance@xmath69 ) . based on its nonvariability and magnitude ( see figure 2 ) , we judge it to be a blue straggler , and unlikely to be the counterpart .",
    "accurate photometry of source d s error circle down to the expected magnitude of cvs or qlmxbs ( @xmath70 ) may be impossible due to the overlapping psfs from nearby blue stragglers and red giants .",
    "it is quite possible that source d is really multiple sources overlapping within the central core , where the concentration of close binaries and thus x - ray sources is expected to be high .",
    "possibilities for source d include a qlmxb , a bright millisecond pulsar , and/or one or more cvs .",
    "our detection limit in this observation was @xmath71(0.5 - 2.5 kev)@xmath72 ergs s@xmath4 , for a 90% confidence detection threshold 4-count source , background being 0.04 counts arcsec@xmath73 at the core .",
    "most detected field cvs are at @xmath74 ergs s@xmath4 in this band , and would thus be missed by this short exposure .",
    "the total detected emission from within one core radius , assuming a 1 kev thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum , was @xmath75 ergs s@xmath4 , and can be accounted for by the two detected sources",
    ". a deeper acis exposure could measure spectra , confirm the possible 43.6 minute period for source b , and identify low - luminosity sources such as cvs .",
    "several potential cvs or hot white dwarfs on the wf2 and wf4 chips are indicated in figure 2 .",
    "additional blue non - variable stars are noted on the pc chip ; their lack of variability and blue colors resemble the non - flickerers noted in ngc 6397 and proposed to be he white dwarfs ( edmonds et al .",
    "1999 ) . however , these could be field stars . using the figures from ratnatunga and bahcall ( 1985 ) for galactic star counts in the direction of ngc 6652",
    ", we estimate that we should see @xmath761.2 stars with @xmath77 between @xmath78 in the pc field , and @xmath7611 stars with @xmath77 between @xmath79 in the combined wf2 and wf4 fields .",
    "thus the wf2 and wf4 blue stars could be explained by field contamination , but it is unlikely that all the blue stars in the pc are field stars .",
    "the locations of the sources in this cluster are intriguing .",
    "sources c and d are within one core radius of the center , but a and b ( each expected to be @xmath761.6 - 2@xmath80  ) are at least 6 and 4 core radii respectively from the center of the cluster .",
    "they are not in dynamical equilibrium in the cluster , since binaries tend to sink toward the cluster core within the local relaxation time ( hut et al .",
    "the half - mass relaxation time for ngc 6652 is @xmath81 years , and both sources are well within the half - mass radius of 39(harris 1996 ) .",
    "we consider the possibility that they have been ejected from the cluster core in a separate paper which considers the radial distribution of all 12 bright lmxbs using both our new chandra positions and updated cluster parameters ( centers and core radii ; grindlay et al .  2001 , in preparation ) .",
