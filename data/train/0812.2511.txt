    ", a fundamental understanding of soft processes may help reveal the underlying mechanism of confinement and explain the intricacies of hadron structure .",
    "experimentally , diffractive processes may be used as tools for new discoveries , as they provide low background environments for certain production channels , among which most notable is the exclusive production of higgs bosons ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : dijets ] ) .",
    "the cdf collaboration has reported several results on soft and hard diffraction processes from @xmath6 collisions at the fermilab tevatron using rapidity gaps and  /  or a leading antiproton as a signature for diffraction ( fig .  [",
    "fig : diffraction ] ) .",
    "these results have revealed regularities in the data that point to a qcd picture of diffraction as an exchange of a spin zero color - singlet combination of gluons and  /  or quarks carrying the quantum numbers of the vacuum ( see review in @xcite ) .",
    "one result that has attracted widespread attention is the observation of a breakdown of qcd factorization in hard diffractive processes , which is expressed as a suppression by a factor of @xmath7(10 ) of the production cross section relative to theoretical expectations .",
    "however , of equal importance is the finding of a breakdown of regge factorization in soft diffraction by a factor of the same magnitude  @xcite",
    ". combined , these two results strongly support the hypothesis that the breakdown of factorization is due to a saturation of the probability of forming a rapidity gap by an exchange of a color - neutral construct of the underlying parton distribution function ( pdf ) of the proton , which is historically referred to as `` pomeron '' .",
    "renormalizing the `` gap probability '' to unity over all @xmath8 phase space corrects for the unphysical effect of overlapping diffractive rapidity gaps and leads to an agreement between theory and experiment ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the gap probability renormalization model is further supported by the following soft - diffraction results obtained by cdf  @xcite :    * double - diffraction ( central gap ) : same suppression factor as in single - diffraction ; * multi - gap diffraction : double - gap to single - gap ratio non - suppressed ; * energy independence : @xmath9  constant as @xmath10 ; * pomeron intercept and slope : they are related",
