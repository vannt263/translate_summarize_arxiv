    "sensitivity to initial conditions in chaotic systems has an exponential asymptotic regime in fully - chaotic regions and a power - law regime in transition regions .",
    "a description in terms of generalized exponentials leading to the definition of generalized lyapunov exponents gives an unified framework for both regimes  @xcite .",
    "for instance , if tsallis generalization is used : the sensitivity @xmath3 grows asymptotically as the generalized exponential @xmath4 , where @xmath5^{1/(1-q)}$ ] ; the exponential behavior for the chaotic regime is recovered for @xmath6 : @xmath7 .",
    "a large class of generalized exponentials shows similar behavior  @xcite .    the statistical definition of entropy production rate , where an ensemble of initial conditions confined to a small region is let evolve and the entropy is a functional of the occupation numbers of an appropriate partition , shows close analogy to the production rate of thermal entropy and appears to coincide with the kolmogorov - sinai entropy in chaotic regimes  @xcite .",
    "this rate of loss of information can be also suitably generalized to include both full - chaotic and edge - of - chaos cases . at the edge of chaos the statistical description",
    "is recovered with the generalized entropic form proposed by tsallis  @xcite @xmath8 , which grows linearly for a specific value of the entropic parameter @xmath9 characteristic of the system : @xmath10 , where @xmath11 reduces to @xmath12 in the limit @xmath13 , @xmath14 being the fraction of the ensemble found in the @xmath15-th cell of linear size @xmath16 . as a matter of fact a large class of entropies , which includes tsallisone , reproduces this asymptotic linear behavior  @xcite . the asymptotic power law behavior ( exponent ) that characterizes the entropy growth is the same that describes the asymptotic power - law sensitivity to initial conditions @xcite .",
    "finally , it has been also conjectured that the relationship between the asymptotic entropy - production rate @xmath0 and the lyapunov exponent @xmath1 for chaotic systems ( the pesin - like identity   is in principle different . ] : @xmath2 ) can be extended to systems at the edge of chaos @xmath17",

    "the requirements  @xcite that the logarithm be an increasing function , therefore invertible , with negative concavity ( the related entropy is stable ) , and that the exponential be normalizable for negative arguments select @xmath25 and @xmath26  @xcite ; solutions with negative @xmath21 and @xmath22 are duplicate , since the family ( [ eq : loggen ] ) possesses the symmetry @xmath27 .",
    "renormalization - group methods have been used  @xcite to demonstrate that the asymptotic behavior of the sensitivity to initial conditions in the logistic and generalized logistic maps is bounded by a specific power - law whose exponent could be determined analytically for initial conditions on the attractor . for evolution on the attractor",

    "sensitivity and entropy production have been studied in one - dimensional dissipative maps using ensemble - averaged initial conditions chosen uniformly over the interval embedding the attractor  @xcite : the statistical picture , i.e. , the relation between sensitivity and entropy exponents and the generalized pesin - like identity , has been confirmed .",
    "indeed the ensemble - averaged initial conditions appear more relevant for the connection between ergodicity and chaos and for practical experimental settings .",
    "the main objective of the present work is to review the general validity of the above - described picture , including the generalized pesin - like identity , and the physical criterion of finite - entropy production per unit time ( linear growth ) , which strongly selects appropriate entropies and fixes their parameters .",

    "since we follow the system for a finite amount of time and the sensitivity and entropy at each time step has a finite error , we expect that the statistical description of the system using a generalized formulation is practically useful not only at the precise onset of chaos , but also for values of @xmath81 slightly larger ( fully chaotic region ) or smaller ( periodic region ) . to estimate the width of the interval of @xmath81 , we have repeated the two previous experiments ( sensitivity and entropy ) with nine values of @xmath81 : four above and four below the onset of chaos .    in fig .",

    "in summary , numerical evidence corroborates and extends tsallis conjecture that also weak chaotic systems can be described by an appropriate statistical formalism .",
    "such extended formalisms should verify precise requirements ( concavity , lesche stability  @xcite , and finite - entropy production per unit time ) to both correctly describe chaotic systems and provide a coherent statistical framework : the last criterion restricts the entropic forms to the ones with the correct asymptotic behavior . using a specific two - parameter class that meets all these requirements , the logistic map shows :    \\(i ) a power - low sensitivity to initial condition with a specific exponent @xmath93 , where @xmath94 ; this sensitivity can be described by deformed exponentials with the same asymptotic behavior @xmath95 ( see fig .  [ fig : sensitivity ] for examples ) ;    \\(ii ) a constant asymptotic entropy production rate ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : entropy ] ) for trace - form entropies with a specific power - behavior @xmath96 in the limit of small probabilities only when the exponent @xmath21 is the same appearing in the sensitivity ;    \\(iii ) a generalized pesin - like identity holds @xmath97 for each choice of entropy and corresponding exponential in the class ; the value of @xmath98 depends on the specific entropy and it is not characteristic of the map .",
    "we remark that the physical criterion of requiring that the entropy production rate reach a finite and non - zero asymptotic value has to consequences : ( 1 ) it selects a specific value of the parameter @xmath21 ( @xmath21 is characteristic of the system ) ; ( 2 ) strongly restricts the kind of acceptable entropies to the ones that have asymptotic power - law behavior ( for instance it excludes renyi entropy  @xcite ) .",
    "the reason we ask for a finite non - zero slope is that otherwise we would miss an important characteristic of the system : its asymptotic exponent .",
    "finally we have estimated the range of @xmath81 for which the sensitivity to initial conditions and the entropy are well described by a power law behavior .",
    "the answer is clearly dependent on the maximum time considered and on our experimental resolution . for time smaller than 30 ( 80 ) the range appears of the order of 0.07 % ( 0.03% )      83 c.  tsallis , a.  r.  plastino , and w .- m .",
