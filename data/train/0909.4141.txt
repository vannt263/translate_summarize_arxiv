    "quark model has achieved a great success to describe hadronic states , but the qcd also predicts the existence of mesons without any valence quark , which is called glueball .",
    "the confirmation of a glueball is one of the most important topics in hadron physics and this subject has received extensive interests @xcite .",
    "lattice qcd , which is almost the only method to do calculations from the fundamental qcd , predicted that the mass of the lowest - lying scalar glueball ( @xmath2 ) is around 1.5 - 1.8 gev  @xcite .",
    "several different candidates have been observed in this mass region , but there is not any solid evidence on the existence of a pure glueball . for decades , people have tried to find a way to verify the existence of a glueball through its decay property .",
    "the glueball is quark flavor singlet , which should decay to @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 equally .",
    "however , the claimed `` unique '' feature of quark flavor singlet , is not unique , since the quark - antiquark state can also be flavor su(3 ) singlet .",
    "thus , it is not a firm evidence for a glueball .",
    "furthermore , it is very likely that the glueball mix with the quark - antiquark scalar state and they together form several physical mesons . on the theoretical side , there are large ambiguities on the mixing mechanism  @xcite .",
    "this makes the study even more complicated .",
    "recently , another important direction to uncover the mysterious structure of scalar mesons , is discussed , which investigates the scalar meson production property through @xmath0 meson decays . in @xmath0",
    "meson decays , the @xmath6 operator has a large wilson coefficient , which could produce a number of gluons .",
    "these gluons in the final state may have the tendency to form a glueball state , thus the glueball production in inclusive @xmath0 decays has attracted some theoretical interest  @xcite . in a recent study @xcite , we calculate the transition form factors of @xmath0 meson decays into a scalar glueball in the light - cone formalism .",
    "compared with form factors of @xmath0 to ordinary scalar mesons , the @xmath0-to - glueball form factors have the same power in the expansion of @xmath7 .",
    "taking into account the leading twist light - cone distribution amplitude , we find that they are numerically only a little smaller than those form factors of @xmath0 to ordinary scalar mesons .",
    "it means that the production rate of glueball in b decays is quite copious .",
    "the scalar meson can be produced in @xmath0 decays by two gluon ( glueball ) and also an isosinglet @xmath8 pair ( ordinary meson ) . in this paper , we will propose a method for experiments to measure the nonzero two gluon contribution , so that to prove the existence of a scalar glueball cleanly . this will require the detection of scalar meson production from @xmath1 decays .",
    "up to the leading fock state , a glueball is made up of two constituent gluons . in exclusive @xmath0 decays",
    ", these two gluons can be emitted from either the heavy @xmath9 quark or the light quark . in the expansion of @xmath10 , the lowest order feynman diagrams for form factors of @xmath0",
    "decays into a scalar glueball are depicted in fig .",
    "[ diagram : feynbtof0 ] ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) . in fig .",
    "[ diagram : feynbtof0 ] ( d ) and ( e ) , the light antiquark in @xmath0 meson and the energetic quark from the electro - weak vertex also form an isospin or su(3 ) singlet scalar meson .",
    "usually , people believe that the form factor of @xmath0 decays to an ordinary scalar meson is larger than that of @xmath0 decays into a scalar glueball .",
    "our recent study shows @xcite that the form factors of @xmath0 decays into a scalar glueball is big enough for the experiments to observe it . compared with our previous studies",
    "@xcite on the transition form factors of @xmath0 mesons decays into ordinary scalar mesons ( denoted as @xmath11 with the mass around 1.5 gev ) , the @xmath12 form factors are at the same order of magnitude .",
    "the @xmath0-to - glueball form factors are only a factor of two smaller than the @xmath13 form factors .",
    "these form factor results are collected in table  [ form ] for comparison   are identified as @xmath14 excited states , referred as scenario i , the decay constants of @xmath11 are negative and so are @xmath15 form factors . in scenario",
    "ii , where scalar mesons @xmath11 are identified as @xmath16 ground state , the form factors are positive . ] .",
    "in fact , the main decay channel of a scalar glueball is @xmath17 or @xmath18 .",
    "thus a scalar glueball is much easier to detect than the iso - singlet pseudoscalar meson such as @xmath19 .",
    "compared with the recently measured semileptonic @xmath20 decay  @xcite @xmath21 the branching ratio of @xmath22  @xcite is comparable with that of @xmath23 decay and may be observed on the ongoing @xmath0 factories .",
    "it is very likely for the forthcoming super b factory to observe a pure glueball , if it exists",
    ".     decays into a scalar glueball @xmath24 and an ordinary scalar meson .",
    "the @xmath25 denotes the possible lorentz structure arising from the electroweak interactions . ]",
    ".@xmath0 to glueball @xmath26 , @xmath0 to ordinary scalar meson ( @xmath11 ) and @xmath0 to pseudoscalar meson ( @xmath27 ) transition form factors in the pqcd approach [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ form ]    however , there is not any solid experimental evidence for a pure glueball state up to now .",
    "the reason may be that the glueball state can mix with the ordinary meson through the strong interactions .",
    "for example , the lattice qcd collaboration predicted the mass of a scalar glueball ground state around @xmath28 - 1.8 gev .",
    "it is very likely that the glueball state mix with the ordinary quark - antiquark state and they form several physical mesons . in this mass region , there are three scalar mesons : @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , which might be the potential candidates .",
    "the mixing matrix can be set as @xmath32 for each physical scalar meson for example @xmath29 , which is a mixture of glueball and ordinary states , the coefficients @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 satisfy the normalization condition @xmath36 a non - zero @xmath33 would be a clear evidence for the existence of a glueball .",
    "let us aim this to see if there is a way to settle it in @xmath0 decays .",
    "the semileptonic @xmath37 decays receive contributions from the @xmath38 component but without @xmath39 component ( at least negligible ) , while the semileptonic @xmath40 channel only receive contributions from the @xmath39 but without @xmath38 component .",
    "both of the decay channels can receive gluon component contributions .",
    "thus from eq.([ren ] ) , we notice that the two independent mixing parameters can be fitted from the above two experimental measurements , in principle . for the three kinds of @xmath11 s , we have altogether 6 experiments , but only three real parameters in eq.([1 ] ) to be fixed .",
    "since the branching fraction of @xmath41 is expected to have the order of @xmath42 or even smaller , one needs to accumulate a large number of @xmath0 decay events .",
    "this could be achieved on the future experiments such as the super b factory .",
    "semileptonic @xmath0 decays are clean but in @xmath37 , the neutrino is identified as missing energy and the efficiency is limited ; while the @xmath41 has a small branching ratio . in these decays , the lepton pair does not carry any su(3 ) flavor and the decay amplitudes receive less pollution from the strong interactions .",
    "the lepton pair can also be replaced by a charmonium state such as @xmath43 since @xmath43 does not carry any light flavor either .",
    "@xmath44 decays may provide another ideal probe to detect the internal structure of the scalar mesons . in @xmath44 decay",
    ", the @xmath39 component will not contribute at the leading order in @xmath10 .",
    "for example , the @xmath45 decay has been set a very stringent upper limit  @xcite : @xmath46 .",
    "thus @xmath44 decay can filter out the glueball component and the @xmath38 component of a scalar meson .",
    "meanwhile in @xmath47 decay , only the @xmath39 and the gluon component contributes",
    ". moreover , the final mesons in these channels are easy to reconstruct and these channels could have sizable branching fractions .",
    "if we use the factorization method , decay amplitudes are given as @xmath48 the wilson coefficient @xmath49 can be extracted from the @xmath50 decays  @xcite @xmath51 the branching ratios are roughly predicted as @xmath52 where we have assumed the same @xmath53 dependence for all form factors and @xmath54 .",
    "the uncertainties are from the experimental data for @xmath55 and the @xmath56 form factors at the @xmath57 point . for",
    "the @xmath58 decays , the branching ratios are comparable with that of @xmath59 : @xmath60 such large branching fractions offer a great opportunity to probe structures of scalar mesons . with the available data in the future , the mixing problem between the scalar mesons will be solvable and the glueball component can be projected out in principle .     decays . ]",
    "if the power - suppressed annihilation diagrams are neglected , the charmful decays of @xmath0 meson , @xmath61 , can also be used to constrain the mixing between scalar mesons .",
    "for instance in @xmath62 , the @xmath38 and gluon component contribute but the @xmath39 component does not , while in @xmath63 , the @xmath38 component will not contribute , as shown in fig .",
    "[ diagram : feynbtof0d ] . thus the mixing coefficients can also be determined if these two channels are experimentally measured .",
    "it is necessary to point out that this method may suffer from sizable uncertainties of annihilation diagrams @xcite .    to be more specific ,",
    "we will discuss two mixing mechanisms in detail .",
    "because the decay width of @xmath30 is not compatible with the ordinary @xmath14 state , amsler and close claimed that @xmath30 is primarily a scalar glueball  @xcite . in the subsequent studies , they extracted the mixing matrix through fitting the data of two - body decays of scalar mesons  @xcite : @xmath64 based on the su(3 ) assumption for scalar mesons and the quenched lqcd results , cheng et al .",
    "@xcite reanalyze all existing experimental data and fit the mixing coefficient as @xmath65 it is found that the @xmath31 tends to be a primary glueball .",
    "this is very different from the first matrix of mixing coefficients in ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "the scalar meson production rates in @xmath0 meson decays can be used to distinguish these assignments , starting with the @xmath56 form factors collected in tab .",
    "for example in scenario i , if we use the mixing coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) , the production rates of @xmath31 and @xmath30 in @xmath0 decays are much smaller than that of @xmath29 but they have large and comparable production rates in @xmath58 decays ; if we use the mixing coefficients in eq .  ( [ 3 ] ) , @xmath31 has small production rates in both @xmath0 and @xmath58 decays but the other two mesons have large and comparable production rates in @xmath0 and @xmath58 decays . based on our predictions on form factors  @xcite ,",
    "these differences in @xmath0 and @xmath58 decays are helpful to distinguish the two mixing matrix .",
    "the ordinary light scalar meson is isospin singlet and/or flavor su(3 ) singlet , while the glueball is flavor su(6 ) singlet .",
    "therefore it is difficult to distinguish them by the light @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 quark coupling .",
    "however , the light ordinary scalar meson has negligible @xmath69 component , while the glueball have the same coupling to @xmath69 as that to the @xmath70 , @xmath71 or @xmath72 . a clean way to identify a glueball is then through the @xmath69 coupling to the glueball",
    ".    in @xmath0 decays , the initial heavy meson contains a light quark , thus contributions of the gluon component always accompany with the quark content @xmath38 or @xmath39 .",
    "it is not easy to isolate the gluon content .",
    "the situation in the doubly - heavy @xmath1 meson is different : it contains a heavy charm antiquark .",
    "the semileptonic @xmath73 decays would happen only through fig .",
    "[ diagram : feynbtof0](a)(b ) and ( c ) but not through fig .",
    "[ diagram : feynbtof0](d ) and ( e ) .",
    "the observation of this decay channel in the experiments will surely establish the existence of a scalar glueball .",
    "moreover the ckm matrix element in this channel is @xmath74 , thus the @xmath75 will have a sizable branching ratio .",
    "this channel will depend on the @xmath76 transition form factor which requires the less - constrained @xmath1 meson s light - cone distribution amplitude .",
    "but even if we assume the form factor of @xmath76 is smaller than the @xmath77 form factor by one order , branching ratios of @xmath78 are suppressed by two orders @xmath79 where the branching ratio of @xmath80 has been taken as @xmath81 .",
    "this branching ratio is large enough for the experiments .",
    "one only needs to reconstruct the @xmath11 scalar meson in the final state and also the @xmath1 meson mass in the intermediate state , so that to make sure that the scalar meson is produced from two gluons .",
    "that experiment is achievable even if the @xmath11 meson is not a pure glueball , but at least has a large portion of it .",
    "@xmath82 is another potential mode to figure out the gluon content .",
    "but in this mode , the @xmath38 component also contributes through the annihilation diagrams .",
    "the @xmath9 and @xmath83 quark annihilates and the @xmath67 and @xmath84 quark are created . the ckm matrix element @xmath74 and",
    "the wilson coefficient @xmath85 are the same with the emission diagram for the @xmath1-to - glueball transition .",
    "the offshellnes of the two internal particles in annihilation diagrams are of the order @xmath86 .",
    "the electroweak vertex is the @xmath87 type and the decay amplitude is proportional to the light quark mass .",
    "thus the decay amplitudes via annihilation diagram for the @xmath38 component are expected to be suppressed . as a result , the @xmath82 also filters out the gluon component of the scalar meson as an approximation .",
    "although the @xmath0-to - glueball form factors are small , they can not be neglected and more interestingly these form factors may have different interferences with those for the quark content , according to different descriptions of scalar mesons . if a scalar meson is a mixture of a glueball and an ordinary meson , we investigate the possibility to extract the mixing mechanism from semileptonic @xmath0 decays .",
    "semileptonic @xmath88 and @xmath41 decays can be used to determine the internal structures .",
    "the nonleptonic @xmath44 and @xmath47 decays are also analyzed . to avoid the interference between the quark and the gluon component , we find that the @xmath89 and @xmath90 will project out the gluon component of a scalar meson cleanly .",
    "our results can be generalized to the other glueballs .",
