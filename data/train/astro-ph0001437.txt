    "during a long term 2 - 28 kev monitoring campaign of the galactic bulge region with the wide field cameras ( wfc ) on board the _ bepposax _ satellite , the new x - ray transient sax  j1810.8 - 2609 was discovered on 1998 , march 10 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the source showed a weak emission ( @xmath615  mcrab ) corresponding to an x - ray flux of @xmath7  erg  @xmath8  s@xmath5 in the 2 - 10 kev range and was positioned in quasi real - time with the quick - look analysis ( qla ) tools at @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( equinox 2000.0 ) with an error radius of @xmath11 . during the on - going monitoring , on march 11",
    "a strong type - i x - ray burst was observed with a peak intensity of @xmath12  crab , from a sky position consistent with that of the persistent emission ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "two days after the source was discovered a follow - up observation was performed with the _ bepposax _ narrow field instruments ( nfi ) showing that the 2 - 10  kev intensity had declined to @xmath13  mcrab ( @xcite ) . on 1998 , march 24 the _ rosat _  high resolution imager ( hri ) observed the error box of sax  j1810.8 - 2609 for 1153  s ( @xcite ) .",
    "a low energy source , named rx  j1810.7 - 2609 , was detected at a position consistent with the wfc error box but not with the one obtained by the qla of the nfi observation .",
    "( @xcite , see however further details in sect.2.1 ) .",
    "the 0.1 - 2.4 kev flux of rx  j1810.7 - 2609 was @xmath14  mcrab and _ rosat _ did not detect the source in previous observations of the same sky region on 1993 september 10 ( 0.1 - 2.4 kev ) , with a 3@xmath15 upper limit of @xmath16 mcrab and in 1990 during the all - sky survey , thus confirming the transient nature of the source .",
    "very recently , greiner et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have reported details of the _ rosat _  hri target of opportunity ( too ) , and of optical to infrared follow - up observations of the 20@xmath17 error box of the _ rosat _  hri source .",
    "they tentatively suggested as counterpart of rx  j1810.7 - 2609 a variable object showing @xmath18 on march 13 and r  @xmath19  21.5 on august 27 .",
    "the _ rosat _",
    "hri observation showed an unabsorbed flux of @xmath1  @xmath20  erg  @xmath8  s@xmath5 . if one assumes a crab - like spectrum , this extrapolates to @xmath1  @xmath21  erg  @xmath8  s@xmath5 in the 2 - 10 kev range , which is a factor of 4 lower than the _ bepposax _  nfi detection ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the variability during the _ rosat _  hri observation was less than a factor of 3 in the 0.1 - 2.4 kev and no evidence of coherent or quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpo ) in the range from 2 to 200  s was found , with a 3  @xmath15 upper limit on the pulsed fraction of @xmath22  40  % ( greiner et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "we here report on a detailed analysis of the wfc and nfi observations of sax  j1810.8 - 2609 , and discuss the nature of the compact source in this x - ray transient .",
    "the wfc ( @xcite ) on board _ bepposax _ are designed for performing spatially resolved simultaneous measurements of x - ray sources in crowded fields enabling studies of spectral variability at high time resolution . the mcrab sensitivity in 2 - 28  kev over a @xmath23  square degrees field of view ( fov ) and",
    "the near - to - continuous operation over a period of years offer the unique opportunity to measure continuum emission as well as bursting behaviour from many new x - ray transients and already known ( weak ) transient and persistent sources . for this reason",
    "the galactic bulge is being monitored over 1 to 2 months during each of the visibility periods since the beginning of the _ bepposax _ operational life in july 1996 . during those observations , that combine to a total of @xmath24  ms net exposure time up to november 1999 ,",
    "more than 900 x - ray bursts and at least 45 sources have been detected ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the data of the two cameras are systematically searched for bursts or flares by analysing the time profiles in the 2 - 10  kev energy range with a 1  s time resolution .",
    "follow - up observations with the more sensitive , broad band narrow field instruments are often performed each time a new transient source is detected in the wfc field of view .",
    "the _ bepposax _",
    "nfi comprise an assembly of four imaging instruments : one low energy and three medium energy concentrator spectrometers , named lecs and mecs , with a 37 and 56 arcmin circular fov and energy ranges 0.1 - 10 kev and 1.8 - 10 kev , respectively ( parmar et al . , 1997 and boella et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the other two non - imaging co - aligned detectors are the high pressure gas scintillation proportional counter ( hpgspc ) , operative in the range 4 - 120 kev ( manzo et al . , 1997 ) and the phoswich detector system ( pds ) , operative in the range 15 - 200 kev ( frontera et al . , 1997 ) . on 1998 ,",
    "march 12.19 ut a _",
    "bepposax _",
    "follow - up observation was performed with the nfi on the wfc error box of the newly discovered source ( ubertini et al . , 1998b ) .",
    "the total observation lasted 85.1 ks corresponding to a net exposure time of 14.4  ks for lecs , 26.8  ks for mecs , 20.0  ks for hpgspc and 30.4  ks for pds .",
    "sax  j1810.8 - 2609 was strongly detected in all instruments , including a high energy tail extending up to @xmath1  200  kev and was the only source present in the lecs and mecs images , at an updated position consistent with the wfc error box ( see sect .",
    "extraction radii of @xmath25 an @xmath26 have been used for source photons for the lecs and mecs images respectively , encircling @xmath27  % of the power of the concentrators point spread function .",
    "these data have been used for spectral analysis and light curves production .",
    "all spectra have been rebinned , oversampling the detector spectral resolution , to have at least 20 counts per channel .",
    "the bandpasses for spectral analysis were limited to 0.3 - 3.0  kev for the lecs , 1.6 - 10.5  kev for the mecs , 4 - 25  kev for hpgspc and 15 - 200  kev for the pds to take advantage of accurate detectors calibration .",
    "the standard procedure to leave free the relative normalization parameters of the different instruments within a narrow band , was applied , to accommodate cross - calibration uncertainties .      on march 11.06633",
    "ut a strong burst was observed from sax  j1810.8 - 2609 ; this is the only x - ray burst ever observed from the source in all the wfc data since 1996 , which amounts to a total net exposure time of @xmath24  ms .",
    "we have improved the source position in the wfc with respect to the one previously reported ( @xcite ) to @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( 1.1  @xmath30 error radius ) , by using the burst data which has a much higher statistical quality than that of the non - burst data ( see table 1 ) .",
    "this confirms the association with the _ rosat _  hri source rx  j1810.7 - 2609 .",
    "we note that the original inconsistency between the _ bepposax _  nfi and _ rosat _  hri ( @xcite , @xcite ) was due to an error in the aspect solution of _ bepposax _ which resulted from an unusual attitude configuration .",
    "we have therefore refined the position of the source taking into account a new calibration ( l.  piro , l.a .",
    "antonelli , private communication ) .",
    "this results in @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( equinox 2000.0 ) with a conservative error radius of @xmath33 , and is now consistent with that determined by the _ rosat _",
    "the various error circles are shown in figure 1 .      a single",
    ", strong burst was detected from sax  j1810.8 - 2609 on 1998 march 11.06634 .",
    "the event lasted 47  s with an e - folding time of @xmath34  s and showed a peak intensity of @xmath35  crab in the 2 - 28  kev band ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the time profiles in two energy bands are shown in figure 2 : a clear double - peaked structure is present at high energy ( 10 - 28 kev ) suggesting photospheric radius expansion ( @xcite ) .",
    "the spectrum of the burst obtained integrating data over the whole burst duration is well represented by a blackbody emission with temperature kt  @xmath36  2 kev . in order to study",
    "the time resolved spectra we have integrated the burst data in time intervals as shown in the lower panel of fig.2 , more or less corresponding to the peak structures observed in the high energy profile . under given assumptions ( @xcite ) the effective temperature @xmath37 and the bolometric flux of a burst can determine the ratio between the blackbody radius @xmath38 ( that is , the radius of the emitting sphere ) and the distance d of the neutron star . assuming @xmath39  kpc and the observed colour temperatures as @xmath37 , and not correcting for gravitational redshift the data are consistent with a radius expansion of a factor of @xmath40 during the first @xmath41  s of the event . the average blackbody radius , excluding the radius expansion part is @xmath42  km ( see table 2 ) at 10 kpc . also evident is the typical spectral softening due to the cooling of the photosphere after the contraction of the emitting region .",
    "these results clearly indicate that the burst is of type - i , i.e. it is identified as a thermonuclear flash on a neutron star ( ns ) .",
    "the total bolometric fluence of the burst , estimated by spectral analysis is @xmath43  erg  @xmath8 .",
    "the observation of the near - eddington profile is a clue to estimate the source distance .",
    "in fact , for a 1.4  @xmath44  ns and a corresponding eddington bolometric luminosity of @xmath45  erg / s we obtain d=(@xmath46 )  kpc , assuming standard burst parameters ( here the error is purely statistical ) . for this distance",
    "the total burst emitted energy is @xmath47  erg and the observed blackbody radius scales to a value of @xmath48  km .",
    "this value of radius could be underestimated , due to the uncertainties in the relationship between colour and effective temperature .",
    "if , as suggested by @xcite the colour temperature exceeds @xmath37 by a factor @xmath61.5 , then the neutron star radius should be at least two times the measured blackbody radius .",
    "these values therefore support a neutron star nature of the compact object .      the light curve of saxj1810.8 - 2609 measured with the _ bepposax _  nfi is shown in figure 3 , in different energy ranges .",
    "there is a slight decrease of the flux in the lower energy range ( e@xmath2210 kev ) in the first @xmath49  ks of the observations , while there is no clear evidence for a decline in the final part of the observation .",
    "this picture is consistent with the overall flux trend of this source , and with the derived e - folding time of @xmath50 days that is estimated from the wfc , _ rosat _  hri and nfi observations .",
    "the count rate spectrum shows substantial emission at high energy .",
    "in fact , the unfolded spectrum in the energy range 15 - 200  kev can be fitted by a single power law of spectral index @xmath51 ( @xmath52=0.76 over 15 d.o.f ) , and a flux in this range of @xmath53  erg  @xmath8  s@xmath5 .",
    "the broad band spectral data , fitted by a single absorbed power law results in a photon spectral index of @xmath54 , with a reduced chi - square @xmath52=1.35 over 165 degrees of freedom and an average flux of @xmath55  erg  @xmath8  s@xmath5 in the 0.1 - 200  kev band .",
    "it is clear that the absorbed power law model is not satisfactory when applied to the broad band emission .",
    "the fit is significantly improved by using a thermal comptonization spectrum ( _ comptt _ in xspec v.10 ) instead of the simple power law , resulting in @xmath52=1.12 for 163 d.o.f .",
    "( see table 3 ) which corresponds to a null hypothesis probability of 0.147 . in this model , the hard x - ray tail is produced by the upscattering of soft seed photons by a hot , optically thin electron plasma ( @xcite ) .",
    "the seed photons temperature for this fit is ( @xmath56 )  kev .",
    "the hard x - ray data , however , can not constrain the parameters of the compton emission region ( temperature and optical depth ) due to the very high energy cutoff which is above @xmath57  kev .",
    "the addition of a soft thermal component improves both the power law and comptonization fits .",
    "the soft component can be modelled satisfactorily with blackbody or multicolor disk ( mcd ) blackbody emission ( @xcite ) .",
    "using single temperature blackbody , the fits for power law and comptonization are both compatible with a temperature value kt@xmath6  0.5  kev ( see table 3 for details ) , giving a @xmath52 of 0.97 and 0.99 respectively .",
    "the power law photon spectral index is @xmath2=@xmath58 and the temperature of the soft comptonized emission is ( @xmath59 )  kev .",
    "the estimated blackbody flux is between @xmath60 and @xmath1  4  @xmath6110@xmath62  erg  @xmath8  s@xmath5 . at the quoted source distance of 4.9  kpc",
    "this indicates an emission radius between @xmath41 and @xmath63  km . using a mcd model to describe the additional soft component ,",
    "the thermal emission is characterized by @xmath64=@xmath65  kev ( temperature at the inner disk radius @xmath66 ) . for this model ,",
    "the best fit gives @xmath52=0.99 for 161 d.o.f .",
    "the values for @xmath66  @xmath67 may range from @xmath14 to @xmath41  km ( here @xmath68 is the disk viewing angle ) .",
    "hence , if this soft component originates from an optically thick region of the accretion disk , this should be expected to be not too far from the ns , unless the disk is seen at very large inclination .    the broadband source spectrum unfolded by the four instruments response",
    "is shown in fig.4 along with the model spectrum obtained for the blackbody component plus thermal comptonization best fit .",
    "we note that the value of @xmath69  @xmath36 3.5@xmath6110@xmath70  @xmath8 obtained for the fits which include comptonization match very well the current estimate of the galactic column density of @xmath71  @xmath8 for this region ( @xcite ) .",
    "the deep and timely investigations carried out by means of repeated _ bepposax _ observations of sax  j1810.8 - 2609 are consistent with a transient type - i x - ray bursting source , most likely a low mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) containing a weakly magnetized ns .",
    "this source is a weak transient , as supported by the fact that it was never detected in more than three years of _ bepposax _ monitoring of the galactic bulge region ( apart from these discovery and follow - up observations ) and also never seen by the _",
    "rxte _  all sky monitor ( asm ) , even during the march 1998 outburst .",
    "the asm non - detection implies an upper limit on the 2 - 10  kev flux of @xmath72  erg  @xmath8  s@xmath5 .",
    "it is noteworthy , that a similar weak transient behaviour has also been observed in a number of recently discovered bursters , detected during dim x - ray outburst episodes with maximum intensities well below 100 mcrab and lasting @xmath73 to a few weeks ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    the estimated value of distance of @xmath74  kpc , that we obtained from the observation of radius expansion during the burst ( @xcite ; @xcite ) places sax  j1810.8 - 2609 at our side of the galactic bulge ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this is consistent with the tentative detection of the optical counterpart ( @xcite ) .",
    "we note that the presence of the neutron star in the system is also supported by the relatively small blackbody radius of @xmath48  km , calculated for the derived distance .",
    "the detection of a single x - ray burst during our monitoring observations is consistent with the observed combination of burst fluence and average persistent bolometric emission , which is @xmath75  erg  @xmath8  s@xmath5 , i.e. @xmath76  @xmath77 at 5  kpc .",
    "in fact , taking into account the total energy release of the burst and assuming that steady nuclear burning is negligible , we can estimate a typical value of @xmath74  days for the mean burst interval , which corresponds to the expected @xmath78 parameter for helium burning ( i.e. , @xmath78  @xmath79 , see @xcite ) and is comparable with the e - folding decay time of 7.5 days estimated for the persistent emission .",
    "conversely , if a significant part of the nuclear fuel is burnt steadily the quoted value should be considered as a lower limit .",
    "the broad band spectrum of sax  j1810.8 - 2609 shows a high energy power law tail , which is remarkably hard ( @xmath80 in the 15 - 200  kev band ) and with no cutoff .",
    "there is also an indication for a soft blackbody component with temperature @xmath81  kev and total flux @xmath82  @xmath1  3  @xmath6110@xmath62  erg  @xmath8  s@xmath5 .",
    "the ratio of the soft component luminosity to the total x - ray ( 0.1 - 10 kev ) luminosity is estimated to be in the range @xmath1  10 - 15% . this is consistent with upper limits obtained for x - ray bursters observed by asca in the low state ( see e.g. , @xcite ) and also with the detection of similar soft components in the spectra of 4u  0614 + 091 ( @xcite ) , 1e  1724 - 3045 and slx  1735 - 269 ( @xcite ) , which were all observed in a hard state . a recent analysis of _ rosat _ spectra of lmxb ( schulz 1999 ) also shows that a soft component is present in several low luminosity ( mainly , atoll type ) x - ray bursters .",
    "the luminosities in the soft and hard x - ray bands match quite well the observed correlation pattern found for neutron star binaries in the low state ( @xcite ) , with values of @xmath1  @xmath83 erg  s@xmath5 in the 1 - 20  kev band , and @xmath1  @xmath84 erg  s@xmath5 in the 20 - 200  kev band .",
    "nevertheless , the absence of cutoff below @xmath1200  kev is particularly outstanding , as in most cases x - ray bursters with hard tail spectra do have this feature which is suggestive of comptonization with plasma temperatures below @xmath1  50  kev ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of such a cutoff was suggested as a possible criterion to distinguish ns from black hole ( bh ) spectra , the latter being characterized by much higher electron temperatures ( @xcite ) .",
    "the case of sax  j1810.8 - 2609 is not compatible with this kind of interpretation .",
    "very recently , an analysis of _ bepposax _ observations of the atoll x - ray burster 4u  0614 + 091 has revealed a similar behaviour , i.e. a high energy power law tail with no visible cutoff ( @xcite ) . whether the spectrum of sax  j1810.8 - 2609 could have a cut - off just above 200 kev ( that is our observational upper energy limit ) is difficult to say .",
    "our broad band spectral analysis shows that only a comptonization fit is compatible with a low energy absorption matching the value of galactic column density .",
    "we conclude that , even if the data are not able to constrain the parameters of the scattering region we still have good indication that comptonization is the mechanism that produces the hard x - ray tail .",
    "we thank team members of the bepposax science operation centre and science data centre for continuos support and timely actions for quasi real - time detection of new transient and bursting sources and the follow - up too observations .",
