    "ic  443 ( g189.1 + 3.0 ) , a galactic supernova remnant ( snr ) at a distance of 1.5  kpc ( welsh & sallmen 2003 ) , is located near the gem ob1 association and a dense giant molecular cloud ( cornett et al .  1977 ) with oh maser emission ( claussen et al .  1997 ) .",
    "these facts strongly suggest that the remnant originated from a collapse of a massive progenitor .",
    "braun & strom ( 1986 ) proposed that the shock wave has expanded into the pre - existing wind - blown bubble shell .",
    "this was confirmed by a kinematical study of the optical filaments ( meaburn et al .",
    "a comprehensive x - ray study of ic  443 was first made with the _ einstein _ and _ heao - a2 _ satellites ( petre et al .",
    "they estimated the snr age to be @xmath43000  yr .",
    "recently , troja et al .  ( 2008 ) derived the age of @xmath44000  yr from the morphologies of the shocked ejecta and interstellar medium ( ism ) revealed by _ xmm - newton_. thus , ic  443 is a middle - aged snr .    using _ asca _ , kawasaki et al .  ( 2002 ) found that the ionization degrees of si and s were significantly higher than those expected from the electron temperature of the bremsstrahlung continuum .",
    "therefore , it was argued that the plasma is in overionization ( @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 , where @xmath5 and @xmath7 are ionization and electron temperatures , respectively ) . on the other hand , troja et al .",
    "( 2008 ) found that the plasma is in collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) , or the overionization is only marginal based on _ xmm - newton _ data .",
    "these two controversial results hinge upon small differences , if any , between the estimated electron and ionization temperatures .    in this letter",
    ", we investigate whether the overionized plasma is really present or not , by utilizing the superior spectral capabilities for diffuse sources of x - ray imaging spectrometers ( xis : koyama et al .",
    "2007 ) aboard the _ suzaku _ satellite ( mitsuda et al .  2007 ) .",
    "if present , we will study the plasma condition quantitatively to discuss the possible origin of the overionization .",
    "the northern part of ic  443 was observed with _ suzaku _ on 2007 march 6 ( observation i d = 501006010 ) .",
    "three xiss located at the foci of the independent x - ray telescopes ( xrt : serlemitsos et al .",
    "2007 ) were operating .",
    "two of the xiss are front - illuminated ( fi ) ccds and the other is a back - illuminated ( bi ) ccd .",
    "the xis was operated in the normal full - frame clocking mode with a spaced - row charge injection technique ( uchiyama et al .",
    "2009 ) during the observation . for the data reduction and spectral analysis",
    ", we used the headas software package of version 6.5 and xspec version 11.3.2 , respectively .",
    "the xis data of revision 2.0 were employed , but reprocessed using the ` xispi ` software and the latest calibration database released on 2009 february 3 .",
    "after the screening with the standard criteria , an effective exposure of @xmath442  ksec was obtained .",
    "the yellow square and the white rectangle indicate the xis field of view and the region used in our spectral analysis , respectively .",
    "the optical digitized sky survey image is overplotted in contour .",
    "[ fig : image ] ]     emission lines from specific elements are labeled in the panel .",
    "[ fig : full ] ]    figure  [ fig : image ] shows the vignetting - corrected xis image in 1.753.0  kev , the energy band including the major lines of k - shell emissions from si and s. we extracted the spectrum from the brightest region , the rectangular with an angular size of @xmath8 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : image ] ) .",
    "this approximately corresponds to the `` center '' region of kawasaki et al .",
    "the xis spectra of the two fis in the entire energy range were made by subtracting the non x - ray background ( nxb ) constructed with the ` xisnxbgen ` software .",
    "the spectra were merged to improve the statistics , because the response functions are almost identical each other .",
    "figure  [ fig : full ] shows the resultant spectrum .",
    "we can see several prominent lines of k@xmath1 emission from he- and h - like ions ( hereafter , he@xmath1 and ly@xmath1 ) . the centroids of the ly@xmath1 lines were measured with a gaussian line model , and compared with the canonical values of the astrophysical plasma emission database ( aped : smith et al .",
    "the averaged center energy difference was + 4  ev .",
    "therefore , we added a 4  ev offset in the fi spectrum .",
    "the bi spectrum was made with the same procedure as the fis , but an offset of @xmath9  ev was added to correct the energy scale . in order to examine the ionization states of si and s , we hereafter focus on the spectrum in the energy range above 1.75  kev ( fig .  [",

    "the residuals seen in ( a ) are disappeared .",
    "[ fig : fit],title=\"fig : \" ]    we first fitted the spectrum with a model of a thin - thermal plasma in cie state ( a vapec model ) .",
    "the abundances ( anders & grevesse 1989 ) of si , s , and ar were free parameters , while the ca abundance was tied to ar .",
    "interstellar extinction was fixed to a hydrogen column density of @xmath11 = @xmath12  @xmath13 with the solar elemental abundances , following kawasaki et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and troja et al .",
    "the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) spectrum was approximated by a power - law model with photon index of @xmath14 = 1.412 and the surface brightness in the 210  kev band of @xmath15  erg  @xmath13  s@xmath16  sr@xmath16 ( kushino et al .",
    "2002 ) . since ic  443 is located in the anti - galactic center direction , contribution of the galactic ridge x - ray emission was ignored . in the initial fit",
    ", we found a significant inconsistency between the fi and bi data around the energy of neutral si k - edge ( 1.84  kev ) .",
    "this is due to the well - known calibration issue of the xis . since the calibration for the fi ccds is currently far better than the bi , we decided to ignore the energy band below 1.9  kev in the bi spectrum",
    "this fit leaved further large residuals , in both spectra , at the energies of s and ar ly@xmath1 lines , and hence was rejected with the @xmath17/dof of 935/270 .",
    "we , therefore , applied a model of one - temperature vapec ( cie plasma ) plus narrow gaussian lines at 2006 , 2623 , and 3323  ev , the ly@xmath1 energies of the si , s , and ar , hydrogenic ions , respectively .",
    "this process is essentially the same as kawasaki et al .",
    "ly@xmath10 lines of the same elements were also added , but they were not significant except for si ( 2377  ev ) .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ fig : fit]a , with the best - fit cie plasma temperature of @xmath7 @xmath4 0.94  kev .",
    "although the @xmath18/dof value was significantly reduced to 657/266 , the model was still unacceptable .",
    "in fact , apparent hump - like residuals are found around @xmath42.7  kev and @xmath43.5  kev , in addition to the systematic model excess in the continuum at the energies above @xmath44.5  kev .    we checked systematic error due to the cxb fluctuation by allowing the cxb intensity as a free parameter .",
    "the fit , however , did not improve at all .",
    "we also tried two - component vapec models with independent temperatures and abundances , but these were rejected with @xmath18/dof = 737/265 .",
    "the results were essentially the same as figure  [ fig : fit]a ; the hump - like residuals remained at @xmath42.7  kev and @xmath43.5  kev .",
    "no additional cie component nor non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) plasma model removed the hump - like residuals with significant improvement of the @xmath17 value .",
    "llcc component & & value + cie ( vapec ) & & 0.61 ( 0.590.64 ) +   & & 0.82 ( 0.780.85 ) +   & & 1.7 ( 1.61.8 ) +   & & 2.5 ( 2.22.8 ) +   & & 6.4 ( 6.36.6 ) +   +   &   & @xmath19 ( kev ) & flux + line & si ly@xmath1 & 2.006 & 2.8 ( 2.72.9 ) +   & si ly@xmath10 & 2.377 & 0.21 ( 0.140.29 ) +   & s ly@xmath1 & 2.623 & 0.84 ( 0.790.90 ) +   & ar ly@xmath1 & 3.323 & 0.11 ( 0.0850.14 ) + rrc & h - like mg & 1.958 & 1.2 ( 1.01.5 ) +   & h - like si & 2.666 & 2.2 ( 2.02.3 ) +   & h - like s & 3.482 & 0.46 ( 0.410.51 ) +    at the energies of the humps , no emission line candidate from an abundant element is found",
    ". however , the energies are consistent with the k - shell binding potentials ( @xmath20 ) of the h - like si ( 2666  ev ) and s ( 3482  ev ) .",
    "therefore , the humps are likely due to the free - bound transitions to the k - shell of the h - like si and s. a formula for the spectrum of radiative recombination continuum ( rrc ) is found in equation  ( 21 ) of smith & brickhouse  ( 2002 ) . when the electron temperature is much lower than the k - edge energy ( @xmath7 @xmath21 @xmath20 ) , this formula is approximated as ; @xmath22 thus , the width of the rrc structure depends on the electron temperature .",
    "we added the rrc of equation  [ eq : rrc ] for h - like si and s. the @xmath7 values of the rrc were linked to that of the vapec component .",
    "then , the fit was dramatically improved to an acceptable @xmath18/dof of 290/264 .",
    "although the hump - like residuals were completely removed by this fit , we further added the rrc model of h - like mg .",
    "this step is reasonable because mg is more abundant than si and s in the solar abundance ratio of anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) and the k - edge energy of h - like mg ( @xmath20 = 1958  ev ) falls into the analyzed band .",
    "the @xmath18/dof value was significantly reduced to 267/263 , which gives an @xmath23-test probability of @xmath24 .",
    "the best - fit parameters and model are given in table  [ tab : fit ] and figure  [ fig : fit]b , respectively .",
    "the spectrum was also fitted with the independent electron temperatures for the vapec and rrc components , but the values are consistent with each other within their statistical uncertainties .",
    "lines as a function of ionization temperature ( @xmath5 ) , predicted by the plasma radiation code of masai ( 1994 ) for recombining plasma with electron temperature ( @xmath7 ) of 0.6  kev .",
    "black and red solid lines represent si and s , respectively . for comparison ,",
    "the same ratios for cie ( @xmath5 = @xmath7 ) plasma ( the apec model : smith 2001 ) are indicated by dashed lines .",
    "the horizontal dotted lines represent the 90% upper and lower limits of the observed values .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] ]    we have found that the 1.756.0  kev spectrum can not be represented with cie nor nei plasma alone , but need the additional fluxes of the lyman lines and the h - like rrc of si and s ( and possibly mg ) .",
    "this is the first detection of clear rrc emissions in an snr . in the following ,",
    "we quantitatively discuss the implications of our spectral results .    from the best - fit model in table  [ tab : fit ] , the flux ratios of h - like rrc to he - like k@xmath1 ( he@xmath1 ) line ( @xmath25 ) are given to be 0.28 ( 0.240.30 ) and 0.18 ( 0.150.20 ) for si and s , respectively .",
    "these are compared , in figure  [ fig : ratio ] , with the modeled emissivity ratios by the plasma radiation code of masai ( 1994 ) for the electron temperature of 0.6  kev .",
    "we find that the large observed ratios of @xmath25 are significantly above those in the cie case ( @xmath5 = @xmath7 ) , but can be reproduced in the overionization case ( @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 ) .",
    "the ionization temperatures of si and s are determined to be @xmath2  kev and @xmath3  kev , respectively .",
    "this is , therefore , the firm evidence of the overionized ( recombining ) plasma .    the overionization claim for ic  443 was first argued by kawasaki et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . using",
    "data , they derived @xmath5 to be @xmath26  kev from the s ly@xmath1/he@xmath1 flux ratio compared with the predicted emissivity ratio in the cie plasma code .",
    "troja et al .",
    "( 2008 ) adopted the same analysis procedure to the _ xmm - newton _ spectrum , and claimed that @xmath5 obtained from the line flux ratio was nearly same as the bremsstrahlung temperature ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "however , since the rrc process is accompanied with electron captures to the excited levels , as given in equation  [ eq : rate ] below , the resulting cascade decay to the ground state contributes the line emission . in a cie plasma , on the other hand , origins of the line emissions",
    "are more dominated by the collisional excitation .",
    "therefore , a @xmath5 determination done by comparing with a cie plasma code is not a proper method .",
    "also , the previous works assumed that the continuum spectrum purely consists of bremsstrahlung emission , and determined @xmath7 to be @xmath2  kev .",
    "this value has been reduced owing to the discovery of the strong rrc emissions .",
    "it should be noted that the elemental abundances in table  [ tab : fit ] are determined as the parameters of the 0.6  kev vapec ( cie ) component , and hence should be modified in the real case of the overionized plasma .",
    "the intensity of the si - he@xmath1 line is given as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are , respectively , emissivity coefficient for electron temperature @xmath30 and fraction of he - like ion for ionization temperature @xmath31 .",
    "the abundance , therefore , can be modified by the fraction ratio of he - like ions , @xmath32 . according to the ionization population calculations by mazzotta et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , the ion fractions of he - like , h - like , and fully - ionized si ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) are estimated to be ( 0.83 , 0.15 , 0.01 ) for @xmath5 = 0.6  kev and ( 0.37 , 0.43 , 0.19 ) for @xmath5 = 1.0  kev , respectively .",
    "then , the modified @xmath36 is @xmath37  solar . for s , ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 )",
    "are ( 0.91 , 0.02 , 0 ) for @xmath5 = 0.6  kev and ( 0.59 , 0.32 , 0.06 ) for @xmath5 = 1.2  kev .",
    "thus , we similarly modified @xmath38 to be @xmath39  solar .    using the measured rrc flux",
    ", we can independently determine the volume emission measure , vem = @xmath40 , from a following equation : @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are k - shell rrc rate coefficient for electron temperature @xmath30 and number density of element @xmath44 , respectively . according to badnell  ( 2006 ) ,",
    "we find total radiative recombination rate for fully - ionized si , at @xmath7 = 0.6  kev , is @xmath45 @xmath4 @xmath46  @xmath47  s@xmath16 . since the rate of the recombination into a level of principal quantum number @xmath48 is described as ; @xmath49 ( e.g. , nakayama & masai 2001 ) , we obtain @xmath50 = 0.65 , for @xmath7 = 0.6  kev and @xmath20 = 2.666  kev .",
    "thus , the vem is calculated to be @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53  @xmath54 .",
    "similarly , @xmath45 at 0.6  kev for fully - ionized s is derived to be @xmath55  @xmath47  s@xmath16 .",
    "therefore , the rrc flux of s corresponds to the vem of @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58  @xmath54 .",
    "these values are almost consistent with that of the vapec component ( table  [ tab : fit ] ) .",
    "the rectangular region in figure  [ fig : image ] corresponds to @xmath59  pc@xmath60 at @xmath61 = 1.5  kpc . assuming the plasma depth of 3  pc , the emitting volume is estimated to be @xmath62  @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , the vem of @xmath63  @xmath54 is converted to the uniform electron density of @xmath64  @xmath65 .    as the mechanism to form the overionized plasma , kawasaki et al .",
    "( 2002 ) proposed that the snr consists of a central hot ( @xmath7 @xmath4 1.0  kev ) region surrounded by a cool ( @xmath7 @xmath4 0.2  kev ) outer shell , and interpreted that the hot interior cooled down via thermal conduction to the cool exterior . under the several reasonable boundary conditions",
    ", they estimated the cooling time from @xmath7 = 1.5  kev to 1.0  kev is about ( 310 ) @xmath66 @xmath67  yr , roughly the same as the snr age ( @xmath44000  yr : troja et al .",
    "2008 ) . however , this scenario can not work on our new results .",
    "according to equation  ( 5 ) of kawasaki et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , the conduction timescale is estimated to be @xmath68 if the similar boundary condition is assumed .",
    "thus , cooling via conduction requires far longer time than the snr age .",
    "photo - ionization is also unlikely because no strong ionizing source is found .",
    "furthermore , the temperature of @xmath40.6  kev is significantly higher than that of a typical photo - ionization plasma ( @xmath690.1  kev : e.g. , kawashima & kitamoto 1996 ) .    since the progenitor of ic  443 has been suggested to be a massive star with strong stellar wind activity ( braun & strom 1986 ; meaburn et al .",
    "1990 ) , we propose another possibility that the rapid and drastic cooling is due to a rarefaction process , as discussed by itoh & masai ( 1989 ) .",
    "if a supernova explodes in a dense circumstellar medium made in the progenitor s super giant phase , the gas is shock - heated to high temperature and significantly ionized at the initial phase of the snr evolution .",
    "subsequent outbreak of the blast wave to a low - density ism caused drastic adiabatic expansion of the shocked gas and resultant rapid cooling of the electrons .",
    "the lifetimes of the fully - stripped ions are roughly estimated to be @xmath70 = @xmath71 @xmath72  yr for si and @xmath73  yr for s , respectively .",
    "note that these values are underestimated compared to the actual timescale for the plasma to reach cie , because the contribution of collisional ionization processes is ignored .",
    "nevertheless , the estimated lifetimes are longer than the age of ic  443 .",
    "the overionized plasma can , therefore , still survive at present .    future observations with very high energy resolution like the _",
    "astro - h _ mission will give firm evidence for the rrc structure not only on si and s but also on the other major elements .",
    "this will provide more quantitative study on the peculiar snr ic  443 .",
    "the authors deeply appreciate the referee , randall smith , for his constructive suggestions on revising manuscript .",
    "we also acknowledge helpful discussions with kazuo makishima and aya bamba .",
