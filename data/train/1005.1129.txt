    "the changepoint @xmath7 is unknown , and the sequence @xmath15 is being monitored for detecting a change .",
    "a sequential detection policy is defined by a stopping time @xmath16 ( with respect to the @xmath17 s ) , so that after observing @xmath18 it is declared that apparently a change is in effect .    by @xmath19",

    "common operating characteristics of a detection policy @xmath16 are @xmath26 , the average run length ( expected time ) to false alarm ( assuming there is no change ) , and @xmath27 , the maximal expected delay to detection .",
    "subject to a lower bound @xmath28 on @xmath26 , the goal is to minimize the maximum expected delay .",
    "note that a uniformly optimal procedure that minimizes the expected detection delay @xmath29 for all @xmath8 over stopping times with @xmath30 does not exist , and we have to resort to the minimax setting .    in 1961 , for the problem of detecting a change in the drift of a brownian motion , shiryaev introduced a detection procedure that is a limit of the bayes procedure when the parameter of the exponential prior distribution tends to zero ; see shiryaev  @xcite .",
    "in particular , certain optimality properties of this procedure were established by shiryaev  @xcite . in discrete time , a similar procedure was first considered by roberts  @xcite as a particular case of the girschick - rubin  @xcite bayesian procedure by setting the parameter of the geometric prior distribution to zero .",
    "therefore , this procedure is usually referred to as the shiryaev ",

    "we conclude with a numerical example that illustrates these phenomena .",
    "recall that @xmath7 denotes the unknown changepoint which is identified with the last time instant under the nominal regime .",
