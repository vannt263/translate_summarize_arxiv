    "solitons play an important rle in many areas of physics . as classical solutions of non - linear field theories",
    ", they are localized structures with finite energy , which are globally regular . in general",
    ", one can distinguish between topological and non - topological solitons .",
    "while topological solitons @xcite possess a conserved quantity , the topological charge , that stems ( in most cases ) from the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the theory , non - topological solitons @xcite have a conserved noether charge that results from a symmetry of the lagrangian .",
    "the standard example of non - topological solitons are @xmath1-balls @xcite , which are solutions of theories with self - interacting complex scalar fields .",
    "these objects are stationary with an explicitly time - dependent phase . the conserved noether charge @xmath1 is then related to the global phase invariance of the theory and is directly proportional to the frequency .",
    "@xmath1 can e.g. be interpreted as particle number @xcite .",
    "while in standard scalar field theories , it was shown that a non - renormalizable @xmath2-potential is necessary @xcite , supersymmetric extensions of the standard model ( sm ) also possess @xmath1-ball solutions @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "several scalar fields interact via complicated potentials .",
    "it was shown that cubic interaction terms that result from yukawa couplings in the superpotential and supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking terms lead to the existence of @xmath1-balls with non - vanishing baryon or lepton number or electric charge .",
    "these supersymmetric @xmath1-balls have been considered as possible candidates for baryonic dark matter @xcite and their astrophysical implications have been discussed @xcite . in @xcite , these objects have been constructed numerically using the exact form of a scalar potential that results from gauge - mediated susy breaking . however , this potential is non - differentiable at the susy breaking scale . in @xcite a differentiable approximation of this potential",
    "was suggested and the properties of the corresponding @xmath1-balls have been investigated in @xmath3 dimensions .",
    "this was extended to @xmath4 dimensions in @xcite .",
    "@xmath1-ball solutions with a @xmath2-potential in @xmath3 dimensions have been studied in detail in @xcite .",
    "it was realized that next to non - spinning @xmath1-balls , which are spherically symmetric , spinning solutions exist .",
    "these are axially symmetric with energy density of toroidal shape and angular momentum @xmath5 , where @xmath1 is the noether charge of the solution and @xmath6 corresponds to the winding around the @xmath7-axis . approximated solutions of the non - linear partial differential equations were constructed in @xcite by means of a truncated series in the spherical harmonics to describe the angular part of the solutions .",
    "the full partial differential equation was solved numerically in @xcite .",
    "it was also realized in @xcite that in each @xmath8-sector , parity - even ( @xmath9 ) and parity - odd ( @xmath10 ) solutions exist .",
    "parity - even and parity - odd refers to the fact that the solution is symmetric and anti - symmetric , respectively with respect to a reflection through the @xmath11-@xmath12-plane , i.e. under @xmath13 .",
    "complex scalar field models coupled to gravity possess so - called `` boson star '' solutions @xcite . in @xcite boson stars have been considered that have flat space - time limits in the form of @xmath1-balls .",
    "these boson stars are hence self - gravitating @xmath1-balls . in @xcite",
    "the gravitating generalizations of the supersymmetric @xmath1-balls studied in @xcite have been discussed in @xmath4 dimensions .",
    "it was found that the behaviour of the mass and charge at the critical value of the frequency depends crucially on the number of dimensions @xmath14 . while in most models considered , the scalar field function is exponentially decaying and hence different notions of a boson star radius exist ,",
    "this is different in models with a v - shaped potential @xcite . in this case ,",
    "compact boson stars with a well - defined outer radius ( very similar to those of `` standard stars '' ) can be given @xcite .",
    "in this paper we are interested in the possibility to detect boson stars through the motion of massive and massless test particles in their space - time .",
    "in particular , we will be interested in the difference between test particle motion in a boson star space - time and a schwarzschild space - time .",
    "since boson stars are very compact , they have been considered as alternatives to supermassive black holes @xcite residing e.g. in the center of galaxies and geodesic motion of massive test particles describing extreme - mass - ratio inspirals ( emris ) has been discussed in some particular cases in @xcite .",
    "while objects with a well - defined surface as alternatives to the supermassive black hole at the center of our own galaxy , the milky way have been ruled out @xcite , the boson stars studied in this paper have a scalar field falling of exponentially at infinity and hence strictly speaking do not have a well - defined outer surface outside which the energy density and pressure , respectively , vanishes .",
    "we hence study _ non - compact _ boson stars in this paper and we will make a detailed analysis of the motion of massive and massless test particles in the space - time of such a boson star .    our paper is organised as follows : in section ii , we give the field theoretical model , the ansatz and the equations of motion to describe the space - time of a non - spinning , non - compact boson star . in section iii",
    "we discuss the geodesic equation and give our numerical results in section iv .",
    "we conclude in section v.",

    "@xmath95 and @xmath96 of the schwarzschild solution tend to zero at the event horizon @xmath101 , while for boson stars @xmath95 and @xmath96 stay perfectly regular for all @xmath102 .",
    "this fact will play an important rle in the behaviour of test particles at small @xmath57 , while our results already indicate here that the behaviour at large @xmath57 will be similar when comparing boson star space - times with the schwarzschild space - time .",

    "we concentrate on the boson stars at some particular values of the frequency @xmath48 .",

    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table [ light_deflection ] we give the light deflection in the boson star space - times indicated in table [ omega_values ] for massless test particles with @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "we observe that the light deflection increases when moving along the branch for @xmath103 up to roughly the minimal possible value of @xmath107 . on the second branch ,",
    "the light deflection decreases again .",
    "similar to what was stated above for massive test particles , there seems to be no direct correlation between the mass of the boson star and the value of light deflection and hence the presence of the scalar field seems to have a non - trivial effect . for @xmath98",
    "we find that the light deflection decreases when moving along the branches .",
    "this again indicates that a semi - analytical treatment of the space - time of boson stars does not lead to the proper results and that numerical techniques are vital to make predictions about observables in such kind of space - times .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the geodesic motion of test particles in boson star space - times and have discussed possibilities to differ them from the geodesics around a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "our work has many interesting applications . as a first example",
    "let us mention the accretion of matter onto massive compact objects such as neutron stars .",
    "neutron stars are very dense objects that are typically modeled using an appropriate equation of state .",
    "boson stars could act as a toy model for these objects . in the following",
    ", one could use our techniques to model accretion flow onto a boson star in a simple ballistic approach .",
    "this was done before in black hole space - times where analytic solutions to the geodesic equation exist @xcite .",
    "this technique could be applied as well using the numerical data of a boson star space - time .",
    "the accretion flow would also be interesting from the point of view of interpreting the boson star as an alternative to a supermassive black hole residing in the center of our milky way .",
    "the accretion of matter leads to the emission of radio waves and these can be used to make predictions about the properties of the supermassive object at the center of our galaxy .",
    "gravitational wave signals would be another possibility .",
    "these have already been discussed in @xcite",
    ".    it would also be interesting to see how test particles move in radially excited boson star space - times as well as in the space - time of a rotating boson star .",
    "for once this is interesting since it is believed that the flat space - time counterparts of boson stars , so - called @xmath1-balls could originally form in an excited state @xcite .",
    "furthermore , due to the interaction with surrounding matter , e.g. accretion , boson stars might be excited .",
    "if boson stars should act as toy model for neutron stars it would be surely also of interest to study the rotating counterparts since basically all observed neutron stars seem to rotate , in fact quite quickly as the example of a radio pulsar ( assumed to be a neutron star ) spinning at 716 hz shows @xcite .",
    "it would then be interesting to study the motion of test particles in these space - times .    finally , in order to model accretion flow onto dense astrophysical objects more realistically one should consider charged test particles ( that would make up the plasma ) .",
    "hence the equation of motion for the particle should be modified to include the charge of the particle .",
    "studies of charged test particles in some black hole space - times have been done previously @xcite . in order to have interactions of the test particles with the boson star the latter",
    "should be charged as well .",
    "this can be done by promoting the global u(1 ) symmetry of our model to a local u(1 ) and has been considered for a number of boson stars @xcite .",
    "the corresponding equation of motion for the test particle would then have to be solved numerically .",
