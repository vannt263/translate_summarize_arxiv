    "x - ray crystallography is one of the key contributions of the physical sciences to the life sciences .",

    "_ , 2001 ; gnatt _ et al .",
    "_ , 2001 ) highlighting the importance of structure to function .",
    "however , roughly 40@xmath6 of biological molecules do not crystallize , and many can not easily be purified .",
    "these factors severely limit the applicability of x - ray crystallography ; although more than 750,000 proteins have been sequenced , the structures of less than 10@xmath6 have been determined to high resolution ( protein data bank , _",
    "http://www.pdb.org_ ) .",
    "the ability to determine the structure of individual biological molecules - without the need for purification and crystallization - would constitute a fundamental breakthrough .    the confluence of five factors has generated intense interest in single - molecule crystallography by short - pulse x - ray scattering : a ) the advent of algorithms for determining phases from measured diffraction intensities by successive and repeated application of constraints in real and reciprocal spaces ( see e.g. fienup , 1978 ; elser , 2003 ; millane , 2003 ) , with demonstrations in astronomy ( fienup , 1982 ) ; diffractive imaging of nanoparticles ( williams _ et al .",

    "_ , 2005 ) ; b ) development of sophisticated techniques for determining the relative orientation of electron microscope images of biological entities , such as cells and large macromolecules ( see e.g. frank , 2006 ) ; c ) development of techniques for producing beams of hydrated proteins by electrospraying or raleigh - droplet formation ( fenn , 2002 ; spence _ et al . _ , 2005 ) ; d ) the promise of very bright , ultra - short pulses of hard x - rays from x - ray free electron lasers ( xfels ) under construction in the us , japan , and europe ( normille , 2006 ) ; e ) the prospect of overcoming the limits to achievable resolution due to radiation damage by using short pulses of radiation ( solem and baldwin , 1982 ; neutze _ et al .",
    ".    it has been suggested ( neutze _ et al .",
    "_ , 2000 ; hajdu _ et al .",
    "_ , 2000 ; abela _ et al .",
    "_ , 2007 ) that an experiment to determine the structure of a biological molecule might , in principle , proceed as follows : i ) a train of individual hydrated proteins is exposed to a synchronized train of intense x - ray pulses .",
    "as a single pulse is sufficient to destroy the molecule , the pulses ( and data collection ) must be short compared with the roughly 50 fs needed for the molecular constituents to fly apart ( neutze _ et al .",
    "_ , 2000 ; jurek _ et al .",
    "_ , 2004 ) .",
    "ii ) the two - dimensional ( 2d ) diffraction patterns obtained with single pulses are read out , each pattern corresponding to an unknown , random orientation of the molecule .",
    "iii ) the relative orientations of the molecule corresponding to 2d diffraction patterns ( and hence the relative orientations of each diffraction pattern in 3d reciprocal space ) are determined .",
    "iv ) a noise - averaged 3d diffracted intensity distribution is constructed .",
    "v ) the structure of the molecule is determined from the diffracted intensity distribution by an iterative `` phasing algorithm '' ( miao _ et al .",
    "_ , 2001 ) .    as pointed out by huldt",
    "et al . _ , ( 2003 ) , for this approach to succeed in principle , it is necessary to develop a noise - robust algorithm to determine the relative orientations of diffraction patterns obtained from randomly - oriented individual molecules , to reconstruct the 3d diffracted intensity distribution of sufficient quality , and to determine the secondary structure of individual biological molecules .    in brief , starting with a collection of noisy 2d diffraction patterns of unknown orientation , such a method recovers the 3d electron density of a molecule , providing a quantitative measure of the reliability of the reconstruction .",
    "it has been suggested that an algorithm developed for the analogous problem of the reconstructing a 3d image of a large molecule or nanoparticle from different projected electron microscope images , the method of common lines , may be employed for this task .",
    "we investigate the capabilities and limitations of such an approach for structure recovery from simulated short - wavelength diffraction patterns of a small ( 10-residue ) synthetic protein , chignolin ( protein data bank entry 1uao ) .    starting with 630 simulated , noise - free 2d diffraction patterns of 0.1   wavelength x - rays from random orientations of the molecule ,",
    "we show that such an algorithm is able to recover the electron density distribution of the ( small ) test protein molecule , chignolin , up to about 1   resolution with a fidelity measured by a correlation coefficient of 0.7 between the model and recovered electron density distributions .",
    "this constitutes the first demonstration of an integrated algorithm able to perform all the tasks necessary to extract a molecular electron density from a set of 2d diffraction patterns of random unknown orientations .",
    "we have also investigated the limits of the algorithm with respect to shot noise ( modeled by poisson statistics ) in the detected signal .",
    "our results show that the common - line method requires at least 10 photons / pixel .",
    "this is at least two orders of magnitude higher than the anticipated signal levels from the lcls xfel currently under construction .",
    "the algorithm consists of three primary modules : a ) determination of the relative orientations of the measured diffraction patterns in 3d reciprocal space ; b ) from the resulting irregular distribution of diffracted intensities , application of a gridding algorithm to generate data on a uniform rectilinear grid in reciprocal space ; c ) application to this gridded data of a 3d iterative algorithm to find the phases associated with the grid intensities , and recover the 3d electron density of the molecule . for an experiment which provided independent information about the orientations of the sample",
    ", steps b ) and c ) were previously implemented by chapman _ et al . _",
    "in the following , we assume that the x - ray energy is high enough , and the solid angle subtended by the diffraction pattern at the sample small enough that it is a reasonable approximation to consider each diffraction pattern as a planar central section through the 3d reciprocal space of the molecule . in practice , this is valid for x - ray wavelengths of about 0.1 ",
    ". then , the problem reduces to determining the relative orientations of these planar sections from the data in the diffraction patterns alone without any knowledge of the structure of the molecule . for longer wavelengths , as pointed out previously ( e.g. huldt _ et al . _ , 2003 , chapman , 2007 ) , it will be necessary to take account of the curvature of the ewald sphere , when the common lines become arcs of a circle rather than straight lines .",
    "the extra complexity of identifying such arcs may be offset by two factors : ( 1 ) the avoidance of ambiguities stemming from the duplication of intensities in the same 2d diffraction pattern , due to friedel s law ( see below ) ; and ( 2 ) the possibility of determining all three euler angles relating the orientations of any two diffraction patterns from just their mutual common line ( huldt , _ et al .",
    "_ , 2003 ) , if the extra parameter of the radius of curvature of the common arcs may be determined with sufficient accuracy .",
    "our approach is inspired by the analogous problem of reconstructing the 3d structure of a macromolecule or nanoparticle from electron microscope images representing projections of copies of the object along random directions ( frank , 2006 ) .",
    "this problem has been solved by exploiting the central section theorem ( farrow and ottensmeyer , 1992 ) , and has been developed most notably by these authors and also previously by van heel ( 1987 ) ; and goncharov et al . , ( 1987 ) .",
    "from the _ projection - slice theorem _ , the fourier transform of a 2d ( i.e. projected ) image is a central slice through the complex 3d reciprocal space of the 3d object .",
    "any two central sections intersect along a line .",
    "this allows partial alignment of the two central sections with respect to each other .",
    "specifically , determination of the gradients of this common line relative to , say , 2d cartesian coordinate systems in the planes of each of the central sections allows two of the three euler angles specifying the relative orientations of these central sections to be deduced . using this procedure , it is generally possible to determine six of the nine interplanar euler angles between _ three _ independent diffraction patterns .",
    "knowledge of these six euler angles allows the remaining three to be deduced by geometrical construction .",
    "we point to one important difference between an application of the common - line approach to images ( as in 3d electron microscopy ) and diffraction patterns .",
    "the images constitute projections of the object in real space .",
    "some applications of the central section theorem have been performed in reciprocal space , exploiting the fact that 2d fourier transforms of these images yield moduli and phases of _ complex _ amplitudes on central sections through reciprocal space .",
    "sinograms of the data of any two diffraction patterns allow the unique identification of a pair of euler angles relating the two central sections in 3d reciprocal space ( frank , 2006 ) .",
    "in contrast , in our problem , the raw experimental data are diffracted intensities , and direct information is available only about the _ moduli _ of the complex amplitudes in reciprocal space .",
    "friedel s law of crystallography suggests that the intensity distribution along a radial line through the center of each diffraction pattern is the same as one rotated relative to it by 180@xmath7 .",
    "this means that , for a flat ewald sphere , the determination of the pair of euler angles from common lines is uncertain by @xmath8 180@xmath7 .",
    "any significant curvature of the ewald sphere removes this ambiguity , but even for a flat ewald sphere , this uncertainty may be resolved through consistency conditions amongst the euler angles , as shown below .",

    "it is important to note that , even for a focussed beam diameter of 0.1 @xmath0 m , the expected photon count per pixel for large - q data ( needed for high - resolution structure determination ) is approximately 3 orders of lower than the level at which the common - line method is able to reliably find the relative orientations of the diffraction patterns .",
    "the estimates of table [ table6 ] suggest that the photon counts in the low - q region of a single diffraction pattern of a large protein may be high enough to render the effects of shot noise negligible .",
    "however , it is unlikely that structural information directly available from low - q data will yield anything more than the overall shape of the scattering object , as in the technique of small angle x - ray scattering ( saxs ) .",
    "it is an open question whether a coarse orientating of patterns , which may be performed with the low - q data , will help to orientate entire diffraction patterns sufficiently accurately to exploit the high - q data for high - resolution structure determination .",
    "the ability to record and sort 2d diffraction patterns from individual molecules is important for a number of reasons .",
    "first and most obvious is the elimination of the need for crystals .",
    "second , and in our view equally important , is the potential to sort and separate diffraction patterns from different molecules or different molecular conformations in the beam prior to structure recovery .",
    "the fact , for example , that 2d diffraction patterns from different molecules do not have common lines might allow the diffraction patterns to be separated into sets before further analysis , with each set designating a different type of molecule or molecular conformation .",
    "this paper has been concerned with developing an algorithm to determine the structure of a single scattering entity ( such as a protein , or nanoparticle ) from multiple diffraction patterns due to scattering from unknown random orientations of identical copies of the object .",
    "we have shown that an adaptation of a `` common - line '' algorithm from 3d electron microscopy / tomography is able to accomplish this task for noise - free diffraction patterns in the flat ewald sphere limit .",
    "there is little doubt that an extension of such a method to curved common - lines will similarly enable structure determination from low - noise diffraction patterns at @xmath3 1   wavelengths characteristic of currently planned xfels ( hajdu _ et al .",
    "_ , 2000 ; abela _ et al .",
    "_ , 2007 ) .    of much greater concern",
    "is that fact that , even with the most powerful xfels currently envisaged , the expected number of scattered photons per high - q pixel of a molecular diffraction pattern from a single radiation pulse is far too low for the alignment approaches proposed so far .",
    "the common - line method relies on identifying similar intensity distributions along _ single lines _ in two low - intensity ( and thus high - noise ) diffraction patterns . as such",
    ", it is hardly surprising that it is very sensitive to noise .",
    "our conclusion is that such a method requires a mean photon count of at least 10 per pixel in the high - q region of a diffraction pattern , about 3 orders of magnitude greater than expected from a proposed experiment with an xfel ( table [ table6 ] ) .",
    "we note that in the proposed experiments , the minimum photon count per diffraction pattern orientation is not determined by the minimum required to reconstruct a satisfactory 3d image of the object from projections of known orientations , as in conventional tomography , but rather by the need for correct classification and assembly of a 3d diffraction volume from data in diffraction patterns alone .",
    "the minimum photon count in the former case may be quite low , since the dose fractionation theorem for 3d electron microscopy / tomography ( hegerl & hoppe , 1976 ; mcewen , downing , & glaeser , 1985 ) states that `` a three - dimensional reconstruction requires the same integral dose as a conventional two - dimensional micrograph provided that the level of significance and resolution are identical '' .",
    "this suggests that if there are m projections ( or in our case , diffraction patterns ) the photon count per pixel required for an equally successful 3d reconstruction will be just 1/m of that for a single projected image ( in our case a single diffraction pattern ) . in the absence of orientational information ,",
    "this theorem does not help , because a much higher photon count ( about 10 photons / pixel per orientational class ) is needed for the successful assembly of a 3d diffraction volume suitable for structure solution . in short ,",
    "the minimum photon count for correct classification and orientation is much higher than that needed for structure recovery of a single biomolecule .",
    "we now consider the possibility of classifying measured diffraction patterns into sets of similar orientations , and averaging their intensities to improve their signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "bortel and faigel ( 2007 ) find that successful classification of measured diffraction patterns of a protein modeled by 35,000 c atoms requires an incident photon fluence of 10@xmath128 m@xmath108/pulse = 10@xmath129 mm@xmath108/pulse .",
    "comparison with our table [ table6 ] shows that this is 100@xmath18 the fluence expected from an xfel beam focused down to a 0.1 @xmath0 m diameter spot .",
    "even if a more efficient method of classification were found , table [ table6 ] indicates that the number of photons expected per high - resolution pixel of the diffraction pattern is @xmath3 10@xmath108 , approximately 3 orders of magnitude smaller than that needed for the common - line method .",
    "this suggests the need for the summation of the data from about 1000 diffraction patterns per orientational class .",
    "since bortel and faigel also find that at about 10@xmath130 classes are required for faithful recovery of the structure of such a molecule ( assumed to be 100   in diameter ) to 3   resolution , it will be necessary to measure @xmath3 10@xmath131 diffraction patterns .",
    "assuming photon pulse and read - out rates of 100 hz , this would require @xmath3 10@xmath5 seconds , or several months of continuous beam time for a single experiment .",
    "we note that the classification problem is not eased for an even larger scattering object , such as a virus or nanoparticle .",
    "( [ en ] ) suggests that the number of photons per detector pixel varies as @xmath132 .",
    "thus , a scattering entity modeled by @xmath109=10@xmath130 c atoms , would scatter 3 times as many photons into each pixel .",
    "however , bortel and faigel ( 2007 ) estimate the number of required orientational classes for the structure solution of such an entity ( assumed to be of 300   diameter ) to 3   resolution is 2@xmath1810@xmath5 , an extra factor of about 30 or so over the 500 kda protein .",
    "thus the total number of diffraction patterns required , and hence time for data collection , would be expected to increase to 10@xmath133 seconds , i.e. several years for a single experiment .",
    "assembling a 3d intensity distribution from the low - intensity diffraction patterns from single molecules obtainable from single pulses of an xfel may not be practical with the common - line method , the only approach mentioned in the literature so far ( see e.g. the technical design report of the european xfel , abela _ et al .",
    "_ , 2007 ) .",
    "this calls for the development of entirely new algorithms that perform structure solution by simultaneously acting on all the data of all measured diffraction patterns .",
    "two such approaches have been suggested by the present authors ( ourmazd _ et al .",
    "_ , 2007 ; saldin _ et al .",
    "_ , 2007 ) and will be the subject of forthcoming publications .",
    "we have presented the first demonstration of an integrated algorithm to determine the electron density of a particle or large biomolecule , such as a protein , from a collection of 2d diffraction patterns , each from a molecule in an unknown random orientation , as expected from the proposed x - ray scattering experiments with xfel sources .",
    "the method involves first determining the relative orientations of the different 2d diffraction patterns , interpolating the data onto a regular 3d cartesian grid in reciprocal space at a sampling rate higher than the nyquist frequency for the size of the molecule , determining the phases associated with the measured amplitudes , and hence deducing the 3d electron density of the molecule or nanoparticle .",
    "there are significant differences with similar algorithms developed previously for 3d electron microscopy , due to the absence of direct phase information , and the ambiguities due to friedel s law .",
    "we have shown how these difficulties may be overcome , even in the limit of a flat ewald sphere , by the imposition of appropriate consistency conditions .",
    "these enable the determination of the relative orientations of the diffraction patterns , and hence the molecular structure , to within the usual enantiomeric uncertainty .",
    "we have tested the algorithm with a computer simulation for a model protein , at an x - ray wavelength short enough to justify the flat ewald sphere approximation , with and without poisson noise for the detected photons .",
    "adaptation of this algorithm to take account of curved common lines can readily extend the applicability of this approach to longer x - ray wavelengths .",
    "our simulations have highlighted an important limitation of a common - line method for finding the relative orientations of diffraction patterns from random orientations of a sample .",
    "such methods depend on comparing the intensity distributions along particular lines in two diffraction patterns , thus using only a very small fraction of the available data for each orientation determination .",
    "they are consequently very sensitive to noise .",
    "we find that the common - line method ceases to work reliably for mean photon counts per pixel below about 10 in the high - q part of a diffraction pattern .",
    "these regions contain the high - resolution information needed to resolve the secondary structure of a protein .",
    "since the scattering by a typical ( 500 kda ) protein of a pulse from a planned xfel beam focused to a spot of 0.1 @xmath0 m diameter is expected to produce some 1000@xmath18 fewer photons per detector pixel , the use of a common - line method would seem to necessitate the classification and averaging of at least 1000 low - intensity diffraction patterns per orientational class to correctly assemble the scattered intensity distribution in 3d reciprocal space .",
    "the method of classifying diffraction patterns into orientational classes examined by bortel and faigel ( 2007 ) requires at least 100@xmath18 the anticipated xfel fluence .",
    "even if superior classification methods were devised , the determination of the structure of a 100  - wide molecule to 3   resolution would require about 10@xmath130 orientational classes ( bortel and faigel , 2007 ) .",
