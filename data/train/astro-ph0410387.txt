    "while accreting gas at relatively low rates , black hole candidates in x - ray binary ( bhxb ) systems are able to power steady , collimated outflows of energy and material , oriented roughly perpendicular to the orbital plane .",
    "the jet interpretation of the radio emission from hard state bhxbs came before the collimated structures were actually resolved with very long based interferometry ( vlbi ) techniques . in a seminal work ,",
    "blandford & knigl ( 1979 ) proposed a model to interpret the flat radio spectrum of extragalactic compact radio sources in terms of isothermal , conical outflows , or jets . a jet model for x - ray binaries",
    "was later developed by hjellming & johnston ( 1988 ) , in order to explain both the steady radio emission with flat / inverted spectra observed in the hard state of bhxbs , and transient outbursts with optically thin synchrotron spectra .",
    "we refer the reader to mcclintock & remillard ( 2004 ) and fender ( 2004 ) for comprehensive reviews on x - ray states and radio properties ( respectively ) of bhxbs .",
    "high resolution maps of cyg x-1 in the hard x - ray state have confirmed the jet interpretation of the flat radio - mm spectrum ( fender 2001 ) , imaging an extended , collimated structure on milliarcsec scale ( stirling 2001 ) .",
    "further indications for the existence of collimated outflows in the hard state of bhxbs come from the stability in the orientation of the electric vector in the radio polarization maps of gx  339@xmath04 over a two year period ( corbel 2000 ) .",
    "this constant position angle , being the same as the sky position angle of the large - scale , optically thin radio jet powered by gx 339@xmath04 after its 2002 outburst ( gallo 2004 ) , clearly indicates a favoured ejection axis in the system .",
    "finally , the optically thick milliarcsec scale jet of the ( somewhat peculiar ) bh candidate grs 1915 + 105 ( dhawan , mirabel & rodrguez 2000 ) in the plateau state ( klein - wolt 2002 ) supports the association of hard x - ray states of bhxbs with steady , partially self - absorbed jets .    having established this association , a natural question arises : what are the required conditions for a steady jet to exist ? we wonder especially whether the jet survives in the very low luminosity , _ quiescent _ x - ray state . while radio emission from bhxbs in the thermal dominant ( or high / soft ) state is suppressed up to a factor @xmath650 with respect to the hard state ( fender 1999 ; corbel 2001 , and references therein ) , most likely corresponding to the physical disappearance of the jet , little is known about the radio behaviour of quiescent stellar mass bhs , mainly due to sensitivity limitations . among the very few systems detected in radio",
    "is v404 cygni , which we shall briefly introduce in the next section .",
    "the x - ray binary system is thought to host a strong bh candidate , with a most probable mass of @xmath6 12  ( shahbaz 1994 ) , and a low mass k0iv companion star , with orbital period is of 6.5 days , and orbital inclination to the line of sight is of about 56  ( casares & charles 1994 ; shahbaz 1994 ) .",
    "following the decay of the 1989 outburst that led to its discovery ( makino 1989 ) , the system entered a quiescent x - ray state , in which it has remained ever since .",
    "the relatively high quiescent x - ray luminosity of v404 cyg ( with an _ average _ value of about @xmath7 erg sec@xmath5 in the range @xmath8 kev ; garcia 2001 ; kong 2002 ; hynes 2004 ) is possibly related to the long orbital period and surely indicates that the some accretion continues to take place at @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the eddington x - ray luminosity ( for a 12  bh ) .    as reported by hjellming ( 2000 ) , since ( at least ) early 1999",
    "the system has been associated with a variable radio source with flux density ranging from 0.1 to 0.8 mjy on time scales of days and it is known to vary at optical ( wagner 1992 ; casares 1993 ; pavlenko 1996 ; hynes 2002 ; shahbaz 2003 ; zurita 2003 ) and x - ray wavelengths ( wagner 1994 ; kong 2002 ; hynes 2004 , for a coordinated variability study ) as well .",
    "yet no _ broadband _ radio spectrum of v404  cyg in quiescence , nor of any other stellar mass bh below @xmath11 , is available in the literature to date ( see corbel 2000 for a 2-frequency radio spectrum of gx  339 - 4 at @xmath6@xmath12 ) . given the quite large degree of uncertainty about the overall structure of the accretion flow in quiescence ( e.g. narayan , mahadevan & quataert 1999 for a review ) , it has even been speculated that the total power output of a quiescent bh could be dominated by a radiatively inefficient outflow ( fender , gallo & jonker 2003 ) rather than by the local dissipation of gravitational energy in the accretion flow .",
    "it is therefore of primary importance to establish the nature of radio emission from quiescent bhxbs .",
    "in this brief paper we show that the radio properties of closely resemble those of a canonical hard state bh , suggesting that there is no fundamental difference in terms of radio behaviour between the quiescent and the canonical hard x - ray state .",
    "a comprehensive study of the spectral energy distribution of in quiescence , from radio to x - rays , will be presented elsewhere ( hynes et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) is an aperture synthesis interferometer that consists of a linear array of 14 dish - shaped antennae arranged on a 2.7 km east - west line .",
    "was observed by the wsrt at two epochs :  * i ) * on 2001 december 28 , start time 05:28 ut ( mjd 52271.3 ) , at 4.9 ghz ( 6  cm ) and 8.4 ghz ( 3  cm ) , for 8 hours at each frequency ; observations were performed with the ( old ) dcb backend , using 8 channels and 4 polarizations ;  * ii ) * on 2002 december 29 , start time 06:29 ut ( mjd 52637.3 ) , at 1.4 ghz ( 21  cm ) , 2.3 ghz ( 13  cm ) , 4.9 ghz ( 6  cm ) and 8.4 ghz ( 3  cm ) for a total of 24 hours .",
    "frequency switching between 8.4@xmath02.3 ghz and 4.9@xmath01.3 ghz was operated every 30 minutes over the two 12 hour runs , resulting in @xmath6 5.5 hour on the target and @xmath6 0.5 hour on the calibration sources ( 3c  286 and 3c  48 ) at each frequency . during this set of observations ,",
    "the wsrt was equipped with the dzb backend using eight ivc sub - bands of 20 mhz bandwidth , 64 channels and 4 polarizations .",
    "seven out of the eight sub - bands were employed to reconstruct the images , as the sub - band ivc - if6 failed to detect any signal other than noise over the whole 24 hour period .",
    "the telescope operated in its _ max - short _ configuration , particularly well suited for observations shorter than a full 12 hour synthesis , and with a minimum baseline of 36  m ( see http://www.astron.nl/wsrt/wsrtguide/ for further details ) .",
    "the data reduction , consisting of editing , calibrating and fourier transforming the @xmath13-data on the image plane , has been performed with the miriad ( multichannel image reconstruction image analysis and display ) software ( sault & killeen 1998 ) .",
    "the 1.4 and 2.3 ghz data , containing several sources with flux density well above 100 mjy , were self - calibrated in phase .",
    ".[table1 ] wsrt observations of . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     an unresolved ( beam size of @xmath14  arcsec@xmath15 at 8.4 ghz ) @xmath60.50 mjy radio source is detected at both 4.9 and 8.4 ghz , at the position consistent with that of ( @xmath16(j2000 ) = 20:24:03.78 ; @xmath17(j2000 ) = + 33:52:03.2 ; e.g. downes 2001 ) .",
    "table 1 lists the measured flux densities with errors at each frequency ; the corresponding spectral index ( hereafter defined as @xmath18 , such that @xmath19 ) is of 0.040.68 ; such a large error bar is mainly due to the high noise in the 8.4 ghz map ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the signal / noise ratios are too low to measure linearly polarized flux from the source at the expected level of a few per cent , assuming a synchrotron origin for the radio emission ( see section 3 ) .      is detected at four frequencies with a mean flux density of 0.35 mjy ; flux densities at each frequency are listed in table 1 .",
    "the fitted four - frequency spectral index is @xmath20 .",
    "radio contours as measured at 4.9  ghz are plotted in figure 1 , while figure [ spectrum ] shows the radio spectra of at two epochs .    since returning to quiescence ,",
    "is known to vary on time scales of days , or even shorter , both in radio and in x - rays ; such variability is actually detected in our 2002 wsrt observations .",
    "the low flux of makes it practically impossible to subtract from the @xmath13-data all the other radio sources in the field and generate a reliable light curve of the target .",
    "we thus divided each of the two @xmath6 11-hour data sets on - source in time intervals of @xmath6 5.5 hours ( of which only @xmath6 2.75 hours on source per frequency , due to the frequency switching ) and made maps of each time interval .",
    "significant variability ( checked against other bright sources in the field ) is detected at 4.9 ghz : the flux density varied from 0.270.07 mjy in the first half of the observation , to 0.470.07 in the second half .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , synchrotron radiation from a relativistic outflow accounts for the observed flat radio spectra of _ hard _ state bhxbs ; we refer the interested reader to more thorough discussions in e.g. hjellming & han ( 1995 ) , mirabel & rodrguez ( 1999 ) and fender ( 2001 ; 2004 ) . here",
    "we shall note that the _ collimated _ nature of these outflows is more debated , as it requires direct imaging to be proven .",
    "even though confirmations come from very long based array ( vlba ) observations of cyg x-1 ( stirling 2001 ) and grs 1915 + 105 ( dhawan 2000 ; fuchs 2003 ) in hard states , failure to image a collimated structure in the hard state of xte j1118 + 480 down to a synthesized beam of 0.6@xmath211.0 mas@xmath15 at 8.4 ghz ( mirabel 2001 ) may challenge the jet interpretation ( fender 2001 ) . however , apart from grs 1915 + 105 , which is persistently close to the eddington rate ( see fender & belloni 2004 for a review ) , cyg x-1 in the hard state displays a 0.1 - 200 kev luminosity of 2 per cent @xmath10 ( di salvo 2001 ) , while xte j1118 + 408 was observed at roughly one order of magnitude lower level ( esin 2001 ) .",
    "if the jet size scaled as the radiated power , we would expect the jet of xte j1118 + 408 to be roughly ten times smaller than that of cyg x-1 ( which is 2@xmath216 mas@xmath15 at 9 ghz , at about the same distance ) , and thus still point - like in the vlba maps presented by mirabel ( 2001 ) .",
    "garcia ( 2003 ) have pointed out that long period ( @xmath22 day ) bhxbs undergoing outbursts tend to be associated with spatially resolved optically thin radio ejections , while short period systems would be associated with unresolved , and hence physically smaller , radio ejections .",
    "if a common production mechanism is at work in optically thick and optically thin bhxb jets ( fender , belloni & gallo 2004 ) , the above arguments should apply to steady optically thick jets as well , providing an alternative explanation to the unresolved radio emission of xte j1118 + 480 , with its 4 hour orbital period , the shortest known for a bhxb .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , by analogy , a long period system , like , might be expected to have a relatively larger optically thick jet .        the wsrt observations of performed on 2002 december 29 provide us with the first broadband ( 1.4@xmath08.4 ghz ) radio spectrum of a stellar mass bh candidate below @xmath23 . as we do not have direct evidence ( no linear polarization measurement , no especially high brightness temperature , see below ) for the synchrotron origin of the radio emission from in quiescence , we must first briefly explore different mechanisms , such as free - free emission from an ionised plasma .",
    "the donor in is a k0iv star with most probable mass of 0.7  and temperature around 4300 k ( casares & charles 1994 ; shahbaz 1994 ) , simply too cool to produce any observable free - free radio emission ( see wright & barlow 1975 ) .",
    "alternatively , the accretion flow onto the compact object may provide the needed mass loss rates and temperatures in order to produce a flat / inverted free - free radio spectrum . in ( line- and radiation - driven ) disc wind models , global properties such as the total mass loss rate and wind terminal velocity depend mainly on the system luminosity ( see proga & kallman 2002 ; proga , stone & drew 1998 and references therein ) ; very high accretion rates are required in order to sustain significant mass loss rates and hence observable wind emission , ruling out a disc wind origin for the observed radio flux from v404  cyg . however , that mass loss via winds in sub - eddington , radiatively inefficient accretion flows ( adafs ) may be both dynamically crucial and quite substantial , has been pointed out by blandford & begelman ( 1999 ) .",
    "quataert & narayan ( 1999 ) calculated the spectra of such advection dominated inflows taking into account wind losses , and found that the observations of three quiescent black holes , including v404 cyg , are actually consistent with at least 90 per cent of the mass originating at large radii to be lost to a wind . under the rough assumption that models developed for ionised stellar winds ( wright & barlow 1975 , reynolds 1986 ; see dhawan 2000 for an application to the steady jet of grs 1915 + 105 ) might provide an order of magnitude estimate of the mass loss rate even for such ` advection - driven ' winds , still the required mass loss rate in order to sustain the observed radio emission for a _ fully ionised _",
    "hydrogen plasma is close the eddington accretion rate for a 12  bh ( assuming a 10 per cent efficiency in converting mass into light ) .",
    "lower ionisation parameters would further increase the needed mass loss , bringing it to super - eddington rates . even taking into account geometrical effects , such as wind collimation and/or clumpiness",
    ", the required mass loss rates can not be more than three orders of magnitude below the spherical homogeneous wind , still far too high for a @xmath24 eddington bh to produce any observable radio emission . as free - free emission",
    "does not appear to be a viable alternative , we are led to the conclusion that the radio spectrum of in quiescence is likely to be synchrotron in origin .",
    "this conclusion is supported by polarization measurements during the second phase ( following a bright optically thin event ) of the 1989 radio outburst of , when a slow - decay , optically thick component had developed ( han & hjellming 1992 ) . at this time , after 1989 june 1 - 3 , displayed the same flat / inverted spectrum of the present 2002 wsrt observations , but was at a few mjy level , still high enough to allow the detection of linearly polarized flux , which confirmed the synchrotron nature of the emission .",
    "in addition , the roughly constant and similar polarization angles measured at that time , indicated that the averaged magnetic field orientation changed very little , if at all .",
    "as entered a quiescent regime following the decay of that outburst ( it reached the typical quiescent flux densities about 1 year after the outburst peak ) , it seems reasonable to assume that the present @xmath6 0.5 mjy radio emission with flat / inverted spectrum is of the same nature as the few mjy flat / inverted spectrum component detected in 1989 , and therefore synchrotron in origin .    a further argument for the _ jet _ interpretation of this synchrotron emission is the fact that the radio and x - ray fluxes of over the decline of its 1989 outburst _ and _ at its current quiescent x - ray and radio luminosities , display the same non - linear correlation found to hold in the whole hard state of bhxbs ( corbel 2003 ; gallo , fender & pooley 2003 ) and later extended to super - massive nuclei in active nuclei as well ( merloni , heinz & di matteo 2003 ; falcke , krding & markoff 2004 ) , where there is little doubt about the jet origin of the radio emission .",

    "the doppler boosting factor is likely to vary in the range @xmath4011.1 , calculated for bulk lorentz factors between 11.7 . assuming a distance to v404 cyg of 4 kpc ( jonker & nelemans 2004 and references therein )",
    ", we can thus derive a minimum linear size for the ( 1.4 ghz ) emitting region of @xmath41 cm , or @xmath42 .",
    "this corresponds to about one fifth of the system orbital separation ( shahbaz 1994 ) . for comparison , the highest _ measured _",
    "brightness temperature in a galactic binary system is of a few @xmath43 k at 5 ghz , during a flaring event in cyg x-3 ( ogley 2001 ) .    because of limits on the signal propagation speed , the 5.5-hour time scale variability detected at 4.9 ghz gives an upper limit to the linear size @xmath44 of the variable region : @xmath45 cm , or about 8530 @xmath46 . at a distance of 4 kpc",
    ", this translates into an angular extent @xmath47 mas at 4.9 ghz ( see table 2 ) . in the framework of standard conical jet models",
    "( blandford & knigl 1979 ; hjellming & johnston 1988 ; falcke & biermann 1996 ) , flux variability could be induced by e.g. the propagation of shocks within the compact outflow .",
    "these shocks will not be visible until they reach the point along the outflow where it becomes optically thin at the observing frequency .",
    "the actual morphology of the radio source will depend on the ratio between the thickness @xmath48 of the region where the variability occurs ( the lower the observing frequency , the higher the thickness ) and its distance @xmath49 from the core .",
    "if @xmath50 , we would expect a double radio source with flux ratios depending on doppler boosting , while if @xmath51 , then we would expect to observe a continuous elongated structure .",
    "the ratio @xmath52 is unknown in the case of and could only be determined by measuring _ delays _ between different frequencies . for comparison , the average flux rise time in the oscillations of the flat spectrum radio component in grs 1915 + 105 is of about a few minutes , while the infrared - radio delays are typically of 15 min , indicating that the variable radio source should not be too distant from the core ( mirabel 1998 ; fender 2002 , and references therein ) .",
    "combined with the extended core morphology of both cyg x-1 ( stirling 2001 ) and the core of grs 1915 + 105 ( dhawan 2000 ; fuchs 2003 ) , this suggests that @xmath51 in these two sources , but it is not clear how the outflow properties might scale with the luminosity .",
    "han & hjellming ( 1992 ) , based on the same arguments , were able to constrain the linear size of the optically _ thin _ ejection associated with the fast - decay phase in the radio light curve of the 1989 outburst : from the 5  min time scale variability measured on 1989 june 1st , and from brightness temperature limits , they derived @xmath53 mas .",
    "fluctuations on time scales of tens of minutes were later measured during the slow - decay phase , when an optically thick component had developed , and interpreted as possible hot shocks propagating downstream an underlying compact jet . by analogy",
    ", this would appear a reasonable explanation for the 5-hour time scale variability detected in our wsrt observations as well .",
    "wsrt observations of performed on 2002 december 29 ( mjd 52637.3 ) at four frequencies over the interval 1.4@xmath08.4 ghz have provided us with the first broadband radio spectrum of a quiescent ( with average @xmath54 of a few @xmath55 ) stellar mass bhxb .",
    "we measured a mean flux density of 0.35 mjy , and a flat / inverted spectral index @xmath56 .",
    "wsrt observations performed one year earlier , at 4.9 and 8.4 ghz , resulted in a mean flux density of 0.5 mjy , confirming the relatively stable level of radio emission from on a year time - scale ; even though the spectral index was not well constrained at that time , the measured value was consistent with the later one .",
    "synchrotron emission from an inhomogeneous , optically thick relativistic outflow of plasma seems to be the most likely explanation for the flat radio spectrum , in analogy with hard state bhxbs ( fender 2001 ) .",
    "optically thin free - free emission as an alternative explanation is ruled out on the basis that mass loss rates far too high would be required , either from the companion star or from the inflow of plasma to the accretor .",
    "the collimated nature of this outflow remains to be proven ; based on brightness temperature arguments and the 5.5-hour time - scale variability detected at 4.9 ghz , we conclude that the angular extent of the radio source is constrained between 0.01 at 1.4 ghz and 10 mas at 4.9 ghz ( at a distance of 4 kpc ; jonker & nelemans 2004 ) . in the context of standard self - absorbed jet models",
    ", the flux variability may be due to shocks or clouds propagating in an inhomogeneous jet .",
    "if our interpretation is correct , a compact steady jet is being produced by bhxbs between a few @xmath3 and @xmath6@xmath57 times the eddington luminosity , supporting the notion of quiescence as a low luminosity level of the standard hard state . however , as is the most luminous quiescent bhxb known to date , the existence of a steady jet in this system does not automatically extend to the whole quiescent state of stellar mass bhs .",
    "sensitive radio observations of the nearby , truly quiescent system a0620@xmath000 ( three orders of magnitude less luminous than in x - rays ; e.g. kong 2002 ) , will hopefully provide an answer about the ubiquity of compact jets from stellar mass black holes with a hard spectrum .",
