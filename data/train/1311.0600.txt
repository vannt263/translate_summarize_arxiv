    "the properties of the supernova remnant ( snr ) rcw 103 ( g332.4 - 0.4 ) has been studied at multiple energies , and the snr is well known as it contains an enigmatic central compact object ( cco ; 1e 161348@xmath55055 , hereafter 1e  1613 ) . having a size of @xmath610  in diameter @xcite , it was determined from optical imaging to have a shell expansion rate of 1100 km  s@xmath4 @xcite for a source distance of 3.3 kpc @xcite .",
    "this expansion rate implies an age of approximately 2000 yrs .",
    "the mid- and near - infrared property characteristic of molecular shock , the nearby h@xmath7 emission , and the hco@xmath8 morphological feature suggests that it is interacting with a molecular cloud ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "although it appears similar to typical ccos by being radio - quiet and not having non - thermal point - source and extended emission ( for detailed properties of ccos , see @xcite ; @xcite ; and more recently @xcite ) , the x - ray point source located in the center of rcw  103 @xcite shows strong x - ray variability @xcite and has an x - ray periodicity of 6.67 hr @xcite , making itself unique among known young neutron stars . the properties of this young neutron star is poorly understood , and different possibilities have been proposed @xcite .",
    "snrs are known to have high - energy non - thermal emission , arising from the shocks of sn explosions . with the great capabilities of the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _",
    ", many snrs have been detected at its gev @xmath0-ray energies .",
    "several of them are known to contain ccos , and they are cassiopeia a ( cas a ; @xcite ) , vela jr .",

    "similar to other snrs at the gev energy range , these young snrs that harbor a cco generally have extended power - law emission with photon indices of @xmath9 . with the current _ fermi _  measurements , both a leptonic or a hadronic scenario can describe the observed broad - band spectra , while for individual sources one of the scenarios may be slightly more favored ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "no indication of gev emission from the ccos has been found ; note that for the ccos in pup  a and pks  1209@xmath551/52 , their spin periods are known from x - ray timing ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in this paper we present our analyses of the _ fermi _  data of the rcw  103 region , and report the likely detection of its gev emission . in section 2 the _ fermi _",

    "the large area telescope ( lat ) is a @xmath0-ray imaging instrument on board the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ , which continuously scans the whole sky every three hours in energy range from 20 mev to 300 gev @xcite . in our analyses we selected lat events inside a 20@xmath10 region centered at the position of the snr rcw 103 from",
    "the _ fermi _ pass 7 database .",
    "the time period of the data is from 2008 - 08 - 04 15:43:36 ( utc ) to 2013 - 09 - 09 00:40:00 ( utc ) .",
    "we rejected events below 200 mev because of the relative large uncertainties of the instrument response function of the lat in the low energy range .",
    "in addition we only included events with event zenith angles less than 100 degrees to prevent the earth s limb contamination , and during good time intervals when the quality of the data was not affected by the spacecraft events .",
    "these selections are recommended by the lat team .",
    "we first included all sources within 15 degrees centered at the position of rcw 103 ( cco s position : r.a.=16@xmath1117@xmath12 , decl.=@xmath55102245 , equinox j2000.0 ; @xcite ) in the _ fermi _ 2-year catalog @xcite to make the source model .",
    "the spectral function forms of these sources are provided in the catalog .",
    "we let the spectral normalization parameters of the sources within 4 degrees from rcw 103 free , and fixed all the other parameters of the sources to their catalog values .",
    "we also included the spectrum model gal_2yearp7v6_v0.fits and the spectrum file iso_p7v6source.txt in the source model to consider the galactic and the extragalactic diffuse emission , respectively .",
    "the parameters ` value ' of the galactic diffuse emission model and ` normalization ' of the extragalactic diffuse emission model were let free .",
    "we performed standard binned likelihood analysis to the lat data with the lat science tools software package v9r31p1 , and extracted the test statistic ( ts ) map of a @xmath13 region centered at the position of rcw 103 .",
    "a source map considering sources in the source model outside of the region was made , which is shown in the upper panel of figure  [ fig : lmap ] .",
    "it can be seen from the ts map that rcw  103 is located in a very complex region .    after considering and removing all the sources in the source model in this region",
    ", we then made a residual map , which is shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : lmap ] .",
    "as can be seen , excess @xmath0-ray emission remained near the center , and ts@xmath1460 , indicating @xmath68@xmath1 detection significance",
    "gtfindsrc _ in the lat software package to find the best - fit position of the excess @xmath0-ray emission and obtained a position of r.a.=244319 , decl.=@xmath5510261 , ( equinox j2000.0 ) , with 1@xmath1 nominal uncertainty of 003 .",
    "in addition , detailed analysis indicated that the excess emission only appeared above 1  gev , as the ts value at the region was nearly zero when only the energy range of 0.21  gev was used .",
    "a ts map was thus made with @xmath151  gev photons from the rcw  103 region and a region of @xmath16 centered at rcw  103 is shown figure  [ fig : smap ] .",
    "the detection significance now is improved to @xmath1410@xmath1 ( ts@xmath17100 ) .",
    "the cco 1e  1613 centered at rcw 103 is located slightly outside of the 1@xmath1 error circle with an angular separation of 005 , but within the 2@xmath1 error circle .",
    "there are two nearby sources that could be associated with the excess emission , which are psr j1617@xmath55055 and hess j1616@xmath5508 @xcite .",
    "@xcite analyzed archival x - ray data and suggested that the hess source is the pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) powered by j1617@xmath55055 . in figure",
    "[ fig : smap ] , the pulsar s location and the source size ( 16  diameter ) of hess j616@xmath5508 are marked .",
    "the pulsar is @xmath183.7@xmath1 away from our _ fermi _  source , and in ",
    "[ sec : dis ] we argue that the _ fermi _  source is not likely the associated pwn on the basis of spectral property comparison and source positions .",
    "both pwne and snrs are the main sources detected by the hess survey of the galactic plane ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) at its tev energy range . @xcite searched through sources in the _ fermi _  2-year catalog and found that 2fgl j1615.0@xmath55051 ( see the top panel of figure  [ fig : lmap ] ) is extended and spatially coincident with hess j1616@xmath5508 , suggesting that they are very likely associated ( see also @xcite ) . in our analysis above , 2fgl j1615.0@xmath55051 was treated as a point source , which might not be appropriate if it is truely extended ( note that because of source crowdedness , contamination between the sources can not be avoided ) .",
    "we tested to include 2fgl j1615.0@xmath55051 as an extended source ( 0.32 deg size ; @xcite ) in the source model , and found that excess emission was still detected at the same position but with ts@xmath1440 .",
    "we further checked the fit improvement by calculating the significance values ( estimated from @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the likelihood value ; e.g. , @xcite ) for different setups of 2fgl j1615.0@xmath55051 and the new _ fermi _  source . in the calculation ,",
    "the model for @xmath21 only had the extended source given by @xcite , and the models for @xmath22 had 2fgl j1615.0@xmath55051 plus the new _ fermi _  source , both being either a point source or an extended source ( for the latter case for the new _ fermi _  source , a uniform disk with a radius of 03 was used ; see below ",
    "[ subsec : sda ] ) .",
    "we found that the lowest significance value was 5.5 when 2fgl j1615.0@xmath55051 and the new _ fermi _  source were the extended source and a point source , respectively , and the highest value was 10.2 when the first and the latter were a point source and an extended source , respectively .",
    "the analyses indicate that not only the new _ fermi _  source was clearly detected but also a point source 2fgl j1615.0@xmath55051 is more favored .",
    "we analyzed the spatial distribution of the new _ fermi _",
    "@xmath0-ray source at rcw  103 to determine whether the excess emission is point - like or extended .",
    "we used both a point source with a power - law spectrum at the best - fit position and uniform disk models with power - law spectra to analyze the emission in the 30@xmath5300 gev range .",
    "the searched radius range for the uniform disks was 0105 ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) , and the high energy range was used for the optimal spatial resolution .",
    "additionally in the analysis , only front converting events for the instrument response function p7source_v6::front were included , which allows to reduce the point - spread function ( psf ) of the lat to @xmath23015 ( 68% containment ) .",
    "we fixed the power - law indices at 2 for the models ( obtained from likelihood analysis in @xmath171  gev energy range ; see below ",
    "[ subsec : sa ] ) to reduce the uncertainties . for the point source ,",

    "for the disk models , we fixed all spectral parameters of the sources in the source model at the values obtained above , but let the spectral normalization parameters of the disk models free .",
    "we obtained a ts of 24 for the point source model and a maximum ts value of 37.5 at the radius of 03 for the disk models , although we note that the ts values for the radius range of 01603 do not indicate any significant differences ( table  [ tab1 ] ) . comparing the ts values",
    ", our analysis implies @xmath173@xmath1 detection of the source extension ( the significance was calculated from @xmath24 ; see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the obtained photon fluxes for these models are given in table  [ tab1 ] .      from our likelihood analysis ,",
    "the excess @xmath0-ray emission was found to be detected only above @xmath61 gev .",
    "different source models with a power - law spectrum of @xmath25 , which included a point source or extended sources at the best - fit position , were added to the source model , and the emission was found to have @xmath26 of 1.92.0 with an uncertainty of 0.1 . given the above results from   [ subsec : si ] and   [ subsec : sda ] , we report our @xmath0-ray spectrum result by considering the excess @xmath0-ray emission as an extended source with a size radius of 03 at the best - fit position .",
    "the @xmath0-ray spectrum was obtained by performing maximum likelihood analysis to the lat data in 5 evenly divided energy bands in logarithm from 1300 gev .",
    "similar to those of the other snrs , the obtained spectrum has a relative flat energy distribution with a photon index of @xmath27 . the energy and flux values at the 5 bands",
    "are given in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "the total 1300 gev luminosity was 8.3@xmath28 erg  s@xmath4 , where source distance @xmath293.3 kpc was used for rcw  103 @xcite .",
    "we performed timing analysis to the _",
    "fermi_/lat data of the rcw  103 cco region to search for any modulations .",
    "the lat data within 02 from the position of the cco 1e  1613 were folded at its 6.67 hr periodicity @xcite , and two energy ranges , 0.2300 gev and 1300 gev , were respectively used .",
    "no modulations at the period were detected .",
    "the values from the @xmath30 test @xcite obtained from the folded light curves were 0.2 and 0.1 in the ranges of 0.2300 gev and 1300 gev , respectively , which are significantly small .",
    "the value of @xmath31 is used by the lat team to confirm @xmath0-ray pulsations @xcite .",
    "in addition we also constructed 1000  s binned light curves in the above two energy ranges , which were obtained using _",
    "fermi_/lat aperture photometry analysis .",
    "an aperture radius of 02 was used .",
    "the power spectra in the two energy ranges were extracted .",
    "the exposures used to determine the flux in each time bins were calculated assuming a power - law spectrum with @xmath32 .",
    "no modulations in the two energy ranges were detected .",
    "we tested to increase the radius used for epoch folding and aperture photometry analysis to 04 , but no modulation at the known period or other periods were detected . the obtained @xmath30 values for the folded light curves were similarly small ( 0.5 and 1.9 ) as those given in the above in the two energy ranges .",
    "analyzing the _ fermi_/lat data of the rcw  103 region , we found an extended @xmath0-ray source with @xmath610@xmath1 significance at a position consistent with that of the young snr .",
    "it should be cautiously noted that as shown in both figures  [ fig : lmap ] and [ fig : smap ] , the source is located in a complex region . a few known _",
    "@xmath0-ray sources , the young pulsar j1617@xmath55055 , and hess j1616@xmath5508 are nearby .",
    "the intensity - peak position of this _ fermi _  source also appears to have a @xmath6005 offset from the center of rcw  103 ( however the intensity peak position roughly coincides with the north - west edge of the x - ray shell which overlaps one bright h@xmath7 region ; see @xcite ) .",
    "we determined that the _ fermi _  source probably had a radius of as small as @xmath6016 , which is approximately double the size of the snr seen at x - ray and radio energies . however the property similarity of the source and the other snrs strongly supports the detection of _ fermi _",
    "@xmath0-ray emission from rcw  103 .",
    "for example for those young snrs harboring a cco , they all have prominent emission at energies above 1  gev , and the spectra are a power law with photon indices in a range of 1.852.1 , which makes their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) flat in the energy range . at similar distances",
    ", they have luminosities of 10@xmath3310@xmath34 erg s@xmath4 .",
    "the detection of h@xmath7 lines in the region right outside of the remnant shell of rcw  103 suggests that the remnant is interacting , probably fractionally , with a molecular cloud ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "the ` normal ' @xmath0-ray luminosity value we derived for rcw  103 is consistent with the picture , as the snrs that are known to be interacting with molecular clouds have luminosities at least one order of magnitude higher because of the high target masses of molecular clouds ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the pulsar j1617@xmath55055 ( having a spin - down age of 8.1 kyr ; @xcite ) is located 3.7@xmath1 away from the position of the detected _ fermi _  source . since",
    "electrons responsible for @xmath0-ray emission of pwne via inverse compton ( ic ) scattering are thought to be ` old ' ( i.e. , they are less energetic and have longer lifetimes than those x - ray emitting electrons detected around pulsars due to synchrotron radiation ; e.g. , @xcite ) , a significant offset between a fast - moving pulsar and its gev / tev pwn might appear ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the currently confirmed _ fermi _",
    "pwne all have harder power - law spectra with photon indices in a range of 1.41.6 ( e.g. , the crab pulsar , @xcite ; psr b1509@xmath558 , @xcite ; psr j1838@xmath50655 , @xcite ; psr j1856 + 0245 , @xcite ; psr b1823@xmath513 , @xcite ) , making their seds clearly rising in the _ fermi _  energy range . the difference in the spectral properties of these pwne and",
    "the snrs is distinguishable .",
    "moreover , even if the @xmath0-ray source is a pwn powered by j1617@xmath55055 , it would imply that the pulsar not only moved away from a sky region coinciding with rcw 103 , raising the issue again about whether or not they are associated @xcite , but also has to have an extremely large transverse velocity ( @xmath35 km s@xmath4 ; see @xcite for detailed discussion ) .",
    "the current studies of rcw  103 and the pulsar do not support either of them .",
    "we searched in the simbad astronomical database within the 2@xmath1 error circle of the best - fit position of the @xmath0-ray source , but only a few normal stars besides rcw  103 and its cco are known in the region . given all these , we conclude that _ fermi _  @xmath0-ray emission from the snr rcw  103",
    "was likely detected , although contamination from nearby @xmath0-ray sources due to the low spatial resolution of the lat is possible ( figure  [ fig : lmap ] ; a ts of @xmath62000 at the position of rcw  103 when the nearby sources are kept versus a ts of @xmath660 in the residual map ) . with the conclusion , we studied the sed of rcw  103 by considering both the hadronic and leptonic scenarios . in the scenarios , a power - law spectrum with a cut - off energy @xmath36 for particles of electrons and protons",
    "is assumed : @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the particle kinetic energy , @xmath40 is the spectral index , and @xmath41 is the normalization factor .",
    "a ratio of @xmath42 compares the number of the electrons to that of the protons at a given energy .",
    "we included the radio flux measurements of the snr @xcite as additional constraints , which can be described by a power law with a spectral index of @xmath43 ( figure  [ fig : sed ] ; @xcite ) . in the hadronic scenario ,",
    "@xmath0-rays are emitted due to the decay of @xmath44 mesons produced in collisions of the protons with ambient gas , and in the leptonic scenario , ic scattering or bremsstrahlung emission by / from high - energy electrons contributes dominantly to the observed @xmath0-rays .",
    "we refer to @xcite and references therein for calculation details .",
    "we found that both scenarios can describe the sed .",
    "our model spectra that are dominated by ic scattering , bremsstrahlung , or @xmath44 decay components are shown in the upper , middle , and bottom panel of figure  [ fig : sed ] , respectively . in the calculations ,",
    "an energy density of 0.5 ev @xmath45 for the interstellar radiation field at the location @xcite was used , @xmath46 was needed to fit the radio data points , and @xmath47=2.0 , @xmath48 tev , and @xmath49 tev were found to be able to provide a good fit to the @xmath0-ray part .",
    "our model fluxes at the x - ray energy range of 0.210 kev is generally below 10@xmath50  erg @xmath51 s@xmath4 , which may explain the non - detection of a power - law component in the x - ray spectrum of the snr @xcite .",
    "the x - ray emission from the snr is well described by a non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) plasma model at temperature 0.3  kev with a large ( unabsorbed ) flux of @xmath610@xmath52 erg @xmath51 s@xmath4 ( estimated from the _ einstein observatory _ detection ; @xcite ) .",
    "the values required for other parameters in our calculations , including @xmath53 , the magnetic field strength @xmath54 , the average density of the target baryons ( with which the energetic particles interact ) @xmath55 , the total energy of protons @xmath56 , and the total energy of electrons @xmath57 , are summarized in table  [ tab3 ] . in the @xmath44 decay model , @xmath58 was needed .",
    "if we constrain @xmath56 to be smaller than @xmath59 of @xmath60 , where @xmath60 is the total blast energy , we have @xmath61 . from the x - ray spectral analysis of the snr with the nei plasma model , the density of the x - ray emitting gas @xmath62",
    "was estimated to be @xmath63 ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "in the hadronic scenario in which the relativistic protons impact the adjacent molecular clouds , such a low @xmath62 value does not contradict the above large @xmath55 estimate .",
    "this is because the @xmath55 value includes the contribution of the baryons in the dense molecular clumps , while @xmath62 reflects the low density of the interclump hot gas .",
    "therefore , the hadronic model seems to be consistent with the context of shock  molecular - cloud interaction .",
    "based on the current _ fermi _  measurements , the cut - off energies for electrons and protons in our models are at @xmath61 tev . thus far",
    "no very high energy ( vhe ) tev detection of a source at the position of rcw  103 has been reported ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if hess j1616@xmath5508 is the associated tev nebula , in addition to the apparent positional offset , its flux at @xmath6200 gev @xcite would also be slightly larger ( by a factor of @xmath62 ) than the _ fermi _  value we obtained . comparing to other cco snrs with ages of several thousands years , while the sed of vela jr .",

    "fermi _ ; @xcite ) .",
    "the fact that both rcw  103 and pup  a are in the vicinity of molecular clouds ( e.g. , @xcite ) could be the reason for the similar low cut - off energies , as particles from sn explosion shocks is possibly limited to have relatively low energies due to the interaction with high - density ambient gas ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the detectability of pup  a by the current generation cherenkov telescopes has been pointed out by @xcite , particularly since it is not located in a complex region and has a relatively high galactic latitude of @xmath534 .",
