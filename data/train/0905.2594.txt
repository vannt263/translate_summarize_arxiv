    "the int photometric h@xmath5 survey ( iphas , drew et al . , 2005 ) is a deep ( @xmath621 ) , ccd based survey in three filters ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , h@xmath7 ) covering 1800 sq .",
    "deg . of the northern galactic plane ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "iphas forms part of the european galactic plane surveys ( egaps ) , which also includes the ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ) galactic plane survey ( lawrence et al .",
    ", 2007 , lucas et al . 2008 ) covering 1800 sq . deg . of the plane in @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11",
    "to a depth of @xmath11=19 and the uv excess survey ( uvex , groot et al . in prep . ) .",
    "uvex is planned to complement iphas by covering the same area but in @xmath12 , @xmath13 and hei 5875with an additional @xmath1 band epoch .",
    "these surveys also have upcoming southern counterparts . with the number density of stars highly concentrated on the plane , iphas and egaps",
    "provide ideal tools to study a whole range of stellar and galactic research topics .",
    "they have already yielded significant discoveries in fields such as cataclysmic variables ( witham et al . , 2007 ) , planetary nebulae ( mampaso et al . , 2006 ,",
    "wesson et al . , 2008 ) , young low mass objects ( valdivielso et al . , 2009 ) , star forming regions ( vink et al . ,",
    "2008 ) and extinction in the galactic plane ( sale et al . , 2009 ) .",
    "large scale ccd - based astronomical surveys such as iphas provide accurate photometric and astrometric data on large numbers of astronomical objects .",
    "in addition to their main science goals , surveys such as egaps make their data public ( see gonzalez - solares et al .",
    ", 2008 for details on public iphas data ) and they can be used by anyone in the astronomical community to pursue their own research aims .",
    "combining iphas data with those from other surveys with different wavebands or epochs can lead to discoveries of variable objects and can also allow the parameter space of each object to be expanded to include not only magnitudes and positions but proper motions as well . here",
    "we undertake the first comprehensive , optical , wide field survey to identify proper motions below 0.1 arcseconds per year in the galactic plane by cross - referencing the iphas database with supercosmos ( hambly et al . , 2001 ) scans of the poss - i plates taken in the 1950s .",
    "this gives us a proper motion baseline of approximately fifty years .",
    "early proper motion surveys utilised blink comparators and exceptional patience to indentify moving stars manually . the early manual work of luyten is brought together in two samples , the luyten half - arcsecond survey ( lhs , luyten , 1979a ) which catalogued 3561 objects with proper motions greater than half an arcsecond per year and the new luyten two tenths catalogue ( nltt , luyten , 1979b ) which contained 58845 objects with @xmath140.2 arcseconds per year(/yr ) .",
    "both these surveys ran into difficulties in the galactic plane with the nltt survey less than 50% complete for @xmath15 at magnitudes fainter than @xmath16=16 ( lepine & shara , 2005 ) .",
    "the main modern computational study is that of lepine ( 2008 ) .",
    "they used a sophisticated algorithm to degrade poss - ii images to the same quality as the older poss - i images .",
    "the two could then be subtracted and high proper motion stars identified .",
    "this survey is complete to v=20 and @xmath17=0.15/yr .",
    "however the survey suffers from crowding in the galactic plane leading to a reduction in completeness .",
    "lepine & shara estimate they are only 80 - 90% complete down to v=19 within 15 degrees of the galactic plane .",
    "fedorov et al .",
    "( 2009 ) predict their upcoming catalogue will cover low proper motions in the galactic plane but will not provide a consistent proper motion range due to a varying maximum proper motion .",
    "gould & kollmeier ( 2004 ) used data from the sloan digital sky survey photographic plate data to produce a proper motion survey below 100 milliarcseconds per year .",
    "however this avoided the galactic plane .",
    "the study of folkes et al .",
    "( 2007 ) attempts to fill in the galactic plane gap left by southern surveys such as deacon & hambly ( 2007 ) , pokorny et al . ( 2004 ) and finch et al .",
    "( 2007 ) ( all of which avoid the plane ) by combining ukst and 2mass data in a similar manner to deacon & hambly ( 2007 ) to identify candidate low mass stars and brown dwarfs from their proper motion .",
    "in order to plan our proper motion survey we had to first consider the datasets available .",
    "two datasets are available for use as a first epoch , both having been scanned using the supercosmos plate scanning machine ( hambly et al .",
    "2001 ) . as well as the poss - i plates , the newer , higher quality poss - ii plates with better emulsion sensitivity and improved resolution are also available .",
    "these provide better astrometric accuracy but a much shorter time baseline with respect to iphas ( 10 - 15 years compared to the iphas data versus the roughly 50 year epoch difference betweeen iphas and poss - i ) .",
    "however a shorter baseline means less contamination due to spurious pairings ; @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the number of spurious pairings , @xmath20 is the maximum proper motion and @xmath21 is the epoch difference .",
    "@xmath19 is also proportional to the density of objects around the target .",
    "this is one of the reasons most proper motion surveys have avoided higher density areas of the sky such as the galactic plane .",
    "( 75,120 )    along with these data we also have the upcoming uv excess ( uvex ) survey ( groot et al .",
    ", in prep . ) which will be a blue companion to iphas and a second @xmath1 epoch . this will provide us with ccd quality second epoch astrometry , observed by the same telescope and camera , reduced by the same pipeline but with only a 3 - 5 year baseline .",
    "examining the positional errors between iphas and uvex we found that they were typically 40 milliarcseconds ( see figure  [ uvexerrplot ] ) , rising to 50 mas at @xmath1=19 ( where poss - i plate astrometry becomes difficult , see figure  [ errplot ] ) and to roughly 100 mas , as the survey limit ( r@xmath2221 ) is approached .",
    "hence we can assume that with a three year baseline , the minimum 5@xmath23 proper motion detectable between iphas and uvex at the survey limit ( r@xmath2221 ) is roughly 166 mas / yr .",
    "at the limit at which astrometry on the poss - i plates becomes difficult ( @xmath24=19 ) the minimum proper motion becomes 100 mas / yr . hence below this latter limit ( also below the @xmath17=0.15/yr lower proper motion limit of lepine & shara , 2008 ) there is the potential for a lower proper motion survey to probe to previously unexplored proper motions in the galactic plane . to coincide with the lower limit of a potential iphas - uvex proper motion survey ( less then 100 mas / yr for objects brighter the @xmath1=19 ) and leaving some overlap we decided on a maximum proper motion of 0.15/yr",
    "this means that even with the exceptionally long baseline between iphas and the poss - i plates the maximum pairing radius is only @xmath2210  , making spurious pairings unlikely .",
    "this is due not only to the low chance probability of another object lying in this region near to the target but also because many chance objects which lie so close to the target may also be deblended by the supercosmos software hambly et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . for reasons of poor astrometry",
    ", we have excluded all deblended objects .",
    "the advantage of the poss - ii plates over the poss - i plates is their better astrometry and photometry . however with the long iphas - poss - i time baseline",
    ", even this better quality poss - ii astrometry can not produce a lower minimum proper motion than using poss - i plates and we have ccd quality photometry available from the iphas survey .",
    "the supercosmos scans of poss - i plates only extend to @xmath25 , south of this we use supercomsos uk schmidt telescope @xmath26 plates .    before beginning the proper motion survey it is important to have both surveys on the same astrometric framework as our initial calculations will be based on the global astrometric frameworks of both surveys .",
    "iphas is tied to the 2mass astrometric framework so we converted the poss - i astrometry to the 2mass astrometric reference frame .",
    "this was done in an identical way to the transformation of ukst @xmath27 plates to the 2mass system described in section 2.1 of deacon & hambly ( 2007 ) .    in order to estimate the minimum significant positional shift that can be detected we robustly calculated the positional errors between the poss - i plates and the iphas survey ( the error estimates calculated between the iphas and uvex surveys found in figure  [ uvexerrplot ]",
    "were calculated in the same way ) .",
    "this was done by identifying the same objects in each epoch and calculating the positional differences .",
    "these were then binned by magnitude and the error calculated ( figure [ errplot ] ) . after examining this plot , we determined the 5@xmath23 positional shift to be at one arcsecond , this was then used as our minimum positional shift .",
    "this means our minimum proper motion will be roughly 20 mas / yr . as we will calculate relative astrometric solutions for each object in our final catalogue",
    "this number may vary slightly .",
    "( 75,120 )    our search methodology was as follows .",
    "objects which were flagged as stellar sources or probable stellar sources ( classification flags -1 and -2 , drew et al . , 2005 ) in iphas were selected .",
    "this excludes saturated sources and hence introduces a bright limit to our survey at approximately @xmath1=13.5 .",
    "one initial problem encountered was the difference in the sizes of the point spread functions of the two surveys . often two stars with a small separation which are resolved in iphas",
    "will be blended together on the lower resolution poss plates leading to the erroneous conclusion that one or both of them have moved . to remove this potential source of contamination any iphas object of brightness @xmath28 ( where @xmath29 is in magnitudes ) which had another iphas object brighter than @xmath30 within 6 arcseconds",
    "was excluded .",
    "this magnitude difference was selected as typically objects which are two or more magnitudes fainter than an object will not significantly affect its astrometry .",
    "this pairing radius increased at brighter magnitudes , in line with the rough size of the poss - i psf ( up to 20  for stars brighter than @xmath1=9 ) .",
    "subsequently , iphas objects which were not affected by such crowding had their positions compared with the poss - i data to see if they had a companion within an arcsecond .",
    "if they did they were judged not to have a significant proper motion and hence were excluded .",
    "any potential poss - i pair for these unpaired objects was then searched for .",
    "first the region within 6  was searched and if no pair was found the region within @xmath31 was searched .",
    "any potential pair had to have a poss - i @xmath24 magnitude within 3@xmath23 ( where @xmath23 is approximated from the values for measurement errors quoted in hambly et al .",
    "2001 , roughly 0.2 magnitudes at best ) of the iphas @xmath1 magnitude and had to be stellar sources which had not been deblended and were not in close proximity to bright stars ( note this 3@xmath23 cut could exclude high proper motion variables ) . to ensure that the paired poss - i object does not have an iphas counterpart , the poss - i positions were crosschecked with iphas positions and any object with an iphas pair within one arcsecond was excluded .      in order to gain an insight into the local astrometric accuracy of each proper motion measurement , a local relative astrometry mapping",
    "was carried out for each candidate .",
    "to do this all objects in the same iphas field as the target with brightnesses within one magnitude of the star in question were selected .",
    "these were then used to produce a 6 parameter plate - plate fit using slalib routines ( wallace , 1998 ) to determine the astrometric differences between the two reference frames and to estimate the random errors remaining once these differences have been corrected for .",
    "this fit was then applied and used to calculate a proper motion relative to this reference frame .",
    "this also yielded measures of the positional errors for each field .",
    "however in cases with few reference stars ( i.e. @xmath3220 ) the error will be underestimated . to correct for this",
    "we carried out a series of simulations .",
    "sets of reference stars on two different reference frames were created .",
    "these were given small random bulk offsets between the reference frames as well as individual random gaussian errors .",
    "a fit between the reference frames was carried out and the calculated positional error compared to the indiviual positional errors used .",
    "it was found that for few reference stars the error was underestimated .",
    "we find that the correction factor is well fitted by the equation , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the actual error , @xmath35 the measured error and @xmath36 the number of reference stars .",
    "we find this relation holds fairly well down to as few as six reference stars .",
    "this correction factor was used to ensure all our quoted errors are accurate . where there were not enough reference stars for any fit",
    "an error calculated from the global positional error estimates shown in figure  [ errplot ] was used .",
    "the final catalogue consists of 103058 objects spread across 14126 iphas fields ( including overlap fields ) where the area of each field is roughly 0.3 sq.deg .",
    "these objects all have proper motions more significant than 5@xmath23 where the proper motion errors were typically below 10 milliarcseconds per year ( i.e. @xmath37 40mas ) .",
    "a full list of all these objects will be provided in the electronic edition . to check the sample a reduced proper motion diagram ( luyten , 1918 , credited to hertzprung )",
    "was produced .",
    "reduced proper motion takes observables ( proper motion and apparent magnitude ) and combines them in such a way that the result only depends on characteristics of the star ( tangential velocity and absolute magnitude ) .",
    "the definition we use is given below .",
    "( 75,120 )    ( 75,65 )    ( 75,65 )    ( 75,70 )    ( 75,120 )    ( 75,65 )    @xmath38    where @xmath17 is the proper motion in arcseconds per year , @xmath39 is the distance in parsecs and @xmath40 is the tangental velocity in km / s .",
    "the above definition of reduced proper motion is not the most commonly used but is useful as it removes the constants needed to convert between units .",
    "our reduced proper motion diagram is shown in figure  [ rpmplot ] .",
    "the form is roughly what we would expect from a standard galactic stellar population with clearly identifiable dwarf , subdwarf and white dwarf loci .",
    "however after we studied the spatial distribution of objects it was found that there were several fields with many ( more than 250 ) objects . after some investigation it became clear that these fields had poor astrometric solutions in the iphas data ( mostly due to poor observing conditions ) .",
    "when we examined a histogram of number of detected objects per field it was found that these fields lay beyond the point where the main distribution had died away .",
    "additionally when the reduced proper motion diagrams for objects in these fields was examined it was found that it did not contain the expected population distributions , indicating that the proper motion determinations were not correct .",
    "hence any object lying in these fields was excluded from the final catalogue .",
    "a plot of the spatial distribution of the remaining objects can be found in figure  [ areaplot ] .",
    "it shows that for the majority of the northern plane , the coverage is good with a few patches of incompleteness . however moving along the plane towards the galactic centre",
    "the number of objects drops off dramatically .",
    "this is due to our selection criteria excluding crowded regions as well as large numbers of objects in these regions being blended with other images ( again a result of high stellar density ) .",
    "this can be seen in figure  [ denseplot ] which shows the density of stellar sources in each iphas field : there are clearly fewer high proper motion objects detected in areas of higher stellar density  .",
    "this is also shown by the inverse correleation between the density of stellar sources in a field and the typical number of detected proper motion sources in that field ( see figure  [ densecomp ] ) .",
    "figure  [ ccplot ] shows an iphas colour - colour plot for our objects .",
    "the main locus is a clear , unreddened main sequence ( see drew et al .",
    ", 2005 ) , widened by the fact that the iphas photometry is not yet globally calibrated .",
    "approximately 96% of objects in the catalogue lie on or close to this main sequence .",
    "there is also a white dwarf locus present lying below and to the left of the main sequence .",
    "many objects lie above and to the left of the main sequence .",
    "while this may suggest h@xmath5 emission , it may also be due to poor photometry in a particular field .",
    "hence rather than select all these as potential h@xmath5 emitters , in the next section we will use the study of witham et al .",
    "( 2008 ) to identify objects which appear to have significant h@xmath5 emission relative to the main sequence on the particular field .",
    "finally we checked our sample for common proper motion binaries . to investigate",
    "if we had a distinct population of common proper motion binaries , we plotted a histogram of the separations of all the objects with proper motions within 2@xmath23 of each other .",
    "the trend for coincidence objects should be n@xmath41 and any excess above this at small separations would indicate a separate population of physically bound common proper motion objects .",
    "figure  [ sepplot ] shows our histogram , clearly there is no distinct population of common proper motion binaries present .",
    "as stated earlier , the iphas survey is currently being exploited for many different scientific goals .",
    "one study utilising iphas photometry is that of witham et al .",
    "here iphas photometry is used to identify objects which lie significantly above the main stellar locus on a colour - colour diagram similar to figure  [ ccplot ] . as there will be offsets in the photometry from field to field , witham et al .",
    "( 2008 ) identifies potential h@xmath5 emitters relative to the colour - colour diagram for the field the object lies in . hence objects which appear to be h@xmath5 emitters due to the poor photometry of an individual field are not included in witham et al s sample .",
    "this allows us to treat this dataset as a clean sample of potential h@xmath5 emitters .",
    "cross - referencing this with our own proper motion sample will remove highly reddened ( and distant ) be stars from the witham sample and should leave only potential cataclysmic variables candidates , dme stars and non - da white dwarfs ( ie .",
    "nearby stellar sources showing either @xmath42 emission or less than expected @xmath42 absorption ) . in this",
    "cross - referencing , we also included objects found in our study with proper motions between 0.2 and 0.15 arcseconds per year and objects with @xmath1 magnitudes between 19 and 20 .",
    "these were not included in the final catalogue as these objects were found to suffer from a high level of contamination .",
    "the thirty six crossmatches are shown in table  [ halpha ] .",
    "note eight crossmatches were excluded from this list and from figures  [ rpmplot ] and  [ ccplot ] after inspection of the images by eye found that they may be blended objects .",

    "of these objects one ( iphasj053015 + 251137 ) appears to share a common proper motion with the nearby ( separation 42  ) star tyc 1852 - 777 - 1 ( hog et al . , 1998 ) .",

    "of these one ( iphasj033805 + 563518 ) was found to be an m dwarf with h@xmath5 emission .",
    "the question remains as to why these objects appeared in witham et al.s catalogue .",
    "witham et al .",
    "fitted a curve to the unreddened main sequence in each field and identified emitters as objects which lay significantly above this curve .",
    "the two non - emitting m dwarfs lie in the brightest selection bin of witham et al.s selection process ( @xmath5416 ) . here",
    "the number of objects defining the unreddened main sequence will be smallest . it could be that these are marginal selections where the unreddened main sequence is affected by poor statistics .",
    "it is also possible that these are objects with variable weak h@xmath5 emission .",
    "one moderately red object ( iphasj191733 + 031937 ) appears to lie on the subdwarf sequence .",
    "fifteen of the cross matches objects which appear to lie on the white dwarf sequence in the reduced proper motion diagram ( figure  [ rpmplot ] ) . of these iphasj225040",
    "+ 632838 is the low state cv system gd 552 ( greenstein & giclas 1978 ) .",
    "another two , iphasj043839 + 410931 ( gd 61 , giclas , burham & thomas , 1965 ) and iphasj210951 + 425705 ( eggr 334 , greenstein , 1974 ) are known db white dwarfs . additionally three objects had spectra taken in the iphas spectroscopic follow - up programme with the fast spectrograph on the 1.5 m tillinghast telescope on mount hopkins .",
    "of the remaining nine objects , three had spectra taken using the isis spectrograph on the william herschel telescope ( wht ) on la palma .",
    "these spectra were used to provide rough spectral classifications which can be found in table  [ halpha ] .",
    "seven of the eight spectrally classified objects which lie bluewards of @xmath55=0.4 in the colour - colour diagram ( excluding the known cv gd 552 ) are non - da white dwarfs .",
    "hence we believe the remaining objects are good non - da white dwarf candidates .",
    "valdivielso et al .",
    "( 2008 ) have produced a sample of young , low mass objects using iphas data .",
    "clearly identifying the proper motions of such objects could establish a connection with a known star forming association or moving group .",
    "unfortunately none of these objects appear in our catalogue .",
    "in order to provide a rough estimate of our completeness , we plotted a cumulative proper motion histogram .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ pmhist ] . assuming uniform spatial and velocity distributions and a fully complete survey , the distribution should scale as n@xmath56 .",
    "this is represented by the solid line in the plot .",
    "it is clear that we begin to become incomplete below 60 milliarcseconds per year .",
    "this is due to a combination of our limiting magnitude and some objects falling in fields with poor astrometry ( hence having proper motions which are not significant enough ) .",
    "below about 25 mas / yr it is clear the distribution flattens off and we can say we have no significant population below this mark . we have also compared our results with those in gould & kollmeier ( 2004 ) .",
    "figure  [ pmhist ] shows that in the proper motion range where both surveys have similar proper motion completeness , we have half the number of objects that gould & kollmeier have .",
    "this is despite the two surveys having similar areas ( both around 1400 sq . deg . ) .",
    "however our survey covers a much more crowded area than theirs .",
    "deacon , hambly & cooke ( 2005 ) calculated the area lost to bright and blended stars across the southern sky .",
    "examining their figure 10 , it is clear that in the southern regions of the sky at similar galactic latitude to ours , the completeness is often 50% or worse .",
    "hence we believe this difference in numbers is due the more crowded nature of our survey area .",
    "( 75,105 )    the iphas survey consists of 15270 pointings , which between them cover the 1800 square - degree survey area twice or more .",
    "hence simply taking the size of the detector and multiplying it by the number of fields our survey covers ( 12362 ) will not yield an accurate estimate of our current survey area .",
    "a rough estimate can be provided by multiplying the fraction of the fields we cover ( approximately 81% ) by the total final survey area of 1800 sq .",
    "deg . this yields and approximate area for our proper motion survey of 1457 sq .",
    "however as stated above , due to crowding we are only likely to identify proper motion objects in roughly half this total area .",
    "once data from the few unobserved iphas fields have been relaesed we will apply the same method to the remaining fields , completing our proper motion survey .    in calculating our astrometric solutions we use sets of reference stars .",
    "these may have small bulk motions .",
    "additionally for the objects where we have too few reference stars the raw iphas positions are used .",
    "these are tied to the 2mass ( skrutskie et al .",
    "2006 ) system using reference stars .",
    "hence we will measure proper motions relative to these reference stars rather than absolute proper motions .",
    "lepine ( 2008 ) also encountered this problem .",
    "they concluded that the difference between absolute and relative proper motions was typically less than their measurement errors .",
    "as our measurement errors are similar to theirs ( typicall below their quoted global errors of 8mas / yr in each axis ) , we deduce that any offset between the relative and absolute proper motions of our sample will also be below our calculated errors .",
    "we have completed the first comprehensive wide field proper motion survey of the northern galactic plane ( @xmath0 ) covering proper motions between 150 and approximately 30 arcseconds per year .",
    "this sample covers a large section ( 1457 sq .",
    "deg . ) of the northern plane and contains 57249 objects with significant proper motions .",
    "we also identify seventeen objects in common between our catalogue and the h@xmath5 emission catalogue of witham et al .",
    "these objects fell in to two distinct groups , a blue group dominated by non - da white dwarfs and a red group dominated by maginally selected ordinary main sequence objects .",
    "this sample will clearly be useful in the study of populations such as white dwarfs and subdwarfs in the galactic plane .",
    "we will seek to complete the catalogue for the full survey area and will use the upcoming uvex data to extend it to higher proper motions above the current imposed limit of 0.15 arcseconds per year .",
    "this paper uses data from the supercosmos sky survey and from the int photometric h@xmath5 survey of the northern galactic plane ( iphas ) carried out at the isaac newton telescope ( int ) .",
    "the int is operated on the island of la palma by the isaac newton group in the spanish observatorio del roque de los muchachos of the instituto de astrofisica de canarias .",
