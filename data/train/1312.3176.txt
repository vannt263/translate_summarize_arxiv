    "the topic we are about to discuss was initiated by a concrete and practical question in physics that has eventually revealed its unexpectedly interesting geometrical flavor .",
    "let us begin with a statement of this theoretical problem and postpone applied motivation to the end of this section .",
    "suppose that a planar triangle @xmath0 is a continuous source of charge , which is homogeneously distributed over its surface , i.e. the charge density is constant over the triangle . at which point in the same plane the electrostatic potential of @xmath0 attains its maximum value ?",
    "the above terminology should not be a source of discomfort for a reader with preference for pure mathematical material .",
    "all physical notions will be accompanied with their precise definitions and the discussion will soon turn into elementary geometrical considerations .",
    "let us only recall that the potential of a point source with charge @xmath1 evaluated at a point that is @xmath2 units apart is given by @xmath3 .",
    "this is merely a restatement of _ coulomb s law _ and the constant @xmath4 is not important for us . by `` superposition principle '' for multiple charges",
    "it is therefore reasonable to define the potential generated by the whole triangle @xmath0 as @xmath5 for any point @xmath6 in the plane . here",
    "@xmath7 denotes the two - dimensional lebesgue measure ( i.e. the area measure ) , @xmath8 is an integration variable , and @xmath9 denotes the distance between points @xmath6 and @xmath8",
    ". we are careless about the multiplicative constant or the charge density and we even omit them from writing . in cartesian coordinates the above formula becomes simply @xmath10    it will be shown in proposition [ prop1 ] below that @xmath11 is indeed a well - defined function on the whole plane .",
    "one can draw contour graphs of for various choices of triangles using the mathematica command contourplot @xcite and the level sets will look as those in figure [ figurepotential ] .",
    ".,width=240 ]    such drawings can make us suspect that @xmath11 has the shape of a single `` mountain peak , '' but this certainly could not pass as a rigorous argument . it is not immediately clear from the formula that there even exist a point @xmath12 inside @xmath0 where @xmath11 attains its maximum and it is certainly not obvious that such point should be unique for every triangle .    what would be the physical meaning of the maximum potential point ?",
    "it is the point where the electrostatic field @xmath13 generated by @xmath0 stabilizes .",
    "let us perform a simple thought experiment .",
    "assume that @xmath0 is charged positively and place a negative point charge somewhere in the plane .",
    "it will necessarily be driven by electrostatic forces unless it is placed at a point where it `` feels perfectly stable . ''",
    "figure [ figurefield ] illustrates several integral curves of the vector field @xmath13 , which are also known in physics as _ lines of force _ or _",
    "field lines_.     that lie inside @xmath0.,width=240 ]    observe that they all meet at the same point inside @xmath0 .",
    "this experiment is once again very far from a rigorous proof .",
    "existence of the maximum potential point will be shown in the next section , while its uniqueness will come as a byproduct of several attempts to specify its location throughout the rest of the paper .",
    "we have just mentioned the notion of electrostatic field , so what would that field be in the case of our charged triangle @xmath0 ? it can be defined simply as @xmath14 at any point where the potential @xmath11 is differentiable . in physics ,",
    "the electric field is sometimes ( but not always ) given before the potential .",
    "we have intentionally ordered things this way , simply because the potential of @xmath0 was easier to define mathematically .",
    "going back to a point source , an easily derived and well - known formula is @xmath15 . here",
    "@xmath16 denotes a directed line segment from the source to a point where the field is computed . using the superposition principle",
    "once again we suspect that the correct corresponding expression is @xmath17 or coordinate - wise with @xmath18 and @xmath19 being the standard unit vectors , @xmath20 however , the double integral in the above formula will not be absolutely convergent unless @xmath21 lies outside @xmath0 . to explain the difficulty , assume that @xmath6 is contained in the triangle interior , together with a `` small '' disk @xmath22 of radius @xmath23 around it .",
    "we insert absolute values inside the double integral and only integrate over this disk . changing to a polar coordinate system centered at @xmath6",
    "we obtain @xmath24 because @xmath25 diverges .",
    "so is there a valid formula for @xmath13 that would hold for points @xmath6 in the interior of @xmath0 ?",
    "one simply has to observe that the contributions @xmath26 of points @xmath27 cancel out each other completely , as the opposite vectors add up to @xmath28 , see figure [ figurecancel ] .",
    "therefore , @xmath29 should hold for @xmath6 inside the triangle .",
    "indeed , one can even let @xmath30 , obtaining the expression called the _ principal value _ of the integral : @xmath31 things remain problematic for points",
    "@xmath6 at the boundary , because the same argument shows that the expression for @xmath32 does not converge in any usual sense",
    ". indeed , the potential is continuous but not differentiable at those points .",
    "the main source of motivation for the problem comes from implementation of a certain type of _ boundary element method ( bem ) _ for electrostatic problems @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "boundary element methods are usually formulated by surface elements of a three - dimensional object and these elements are in turn most often represented by triangles . in the case of an electrostatic problem",
    ", a single triangle potential could be evaluated either at vertices , or at a certain interior point , depending on the formulation of the method . in the later case ,",
    "it is common to take the center of mass ( i.e. the centroid ) , but there is no reason or evidence why this would be the best choice .",
    "indeed , one can argue that using the maximum potential point provides better results , but such discourse is out of the scope of this paper .",
    "calculating its coordinates and discovering its properties proved to be challenges on their own .    hoping",
    "the reader got interested in the topic , we turn to purely mathematical discussion . our potential is a particular instance of the so - called _ fractional integral _ ,",
    "@xmath33 which is also known as the _ riesz potential _",
    "@xcite when @xmath34 and when it is properly normalized . in order to obtain ,",
    "one only has to take @xmath35 and choose @xmath36 to be the indicator function of @xmath0 .",
    "extreme points of `` regularized '' versions of @xmath37 when @xmath38 is a real number and @xmath36 is the characteristic function of a general convex set @xmath39 ( in several dimensions ) have already been studied in the literature .",
    "they were named `` radial centers '' by m. moszyska @xcite , who seems to be the first to establish their existence and uniqueness for a certain range of exponents @xmath38 , while the remaining cases were studied by i. herburt @xcite .",
    "the later paper contains a mistake that was fixed by j. ohara @xcite and s. sakata @xcite , who called these points @xmath40 centers .",
    "we remark that our corollaries [ cor1 ] and [ cor2 ] below follow from general results of moszyska @xcite and herburt @xcite .",
    "however , we are interested in a very special case when @xmath35 and when the set @xmath39 is a triangle , so fortunately we are able to keep the exposition simple and self - contained .",
    "finally , herburt , moszyska , and peradzyski @xcite give physical interpretations of radial centers , mentioning gravitational and electrostatic potentials , but do not specialize the discussion to triangles . on the other hand ,",
    "we need to mention an unpublished text by k. shibata @xcite on a similarly defined but different point in a triangle , called the _ illuminating center _ , which we discuss briefly in the last section .",
    "we write @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 for interior , exterior , and boundary of @xmath0 respectively .",
    "whenever @xmath0 is mentioned , we understand that it contains its boundary , but we will always be precise , just for any case .",
    "let us also write `` @xmath44 '' for the euclidean distance function , i.e. @xmath45 .",
