    "the notion of duality of projective varieties , which appears in various branches of mathematics , has been a subject of study since the beginnings of algebraic geometry @xcite . given an embedded projective variety @xmath6 , its dual variety @xmath7 is the closure in the dual projective space @xmath8 of the hyperplanes intersecting the regular points of @xmath9 non transversally .    a projective variety @xmath9 is _ self - dual _ if it is isomorphic to its dual @xmath7 as embedded projective varieties .",
    "the expected codimension of the dual variety is one .",
    "if this is not the case , @xmath9 is said to be defective .",
    "self - dual varieties other than hypersurfaces are defective varieties with `` maximal '' defect .",

    "let @xmath0 be an algebraic torus over @xmath10 and @xmath5 a finite dimensional @xmath0-module . in this paper",
    "we characterize self - dual projective toric varieties @xmath11 equivariantly embedded , in terms of the combinatorics of the associated configuration of weights @xmath12 ( cf .",
    "theorems  [ teo : bside ] and [ teo : aside ] ) and in terms of the interaction of the space of relations of these weights with the torus orbits ( cf",
    ". theorems  [ teoeqauto ] and [ teo : constaut+gde ] ) .",
    "in particular , we show that @xmath9 is self - dual if and only if @xmath13 and the smallest linear subspaces containing @xmath14 and @xmath7 have the same dimension , see theorems  [ thm : autdim ] and [ thm : autdimgral ] .    given a basis of eigenvectors of @xmath5 and the configuration of weights of the torus action on @xmath5 , it is not difficult to check the equality of the dimensions of @xmath9 and its dual ( for instance , by means of the combinatorial characterization of the tropicalization given in @xcite ) .",
    "but the complete classification of defective projective toric varieties in an equivariant embedding is open in full generality and involves a complicated combinatorial problem . for smooth toric varieties",

    "a big class of self - dual toric varieties are the toric varieties associated to lawrence configurations ( see definition  [ df : law ] ) , which contain the configurations associated to the segre embeddings .",
    "lawrence constructions are well known in the domain of geometric combinatorics , where they are one of the prominent tools to visualize the geometry of higher dimensional polytopes ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 6 ) ) ; the commutative algebraic properties of the associated toric ideals are studied in @xcite .",
    "we show in section  [ sec : examples ] other non lawrence concrete examples for any dimension bigger than @xmath19 and any codimension bigger than @xmath20 .",
    "we also introduce the notion of strongly self - dual varieties ( see definition  [ def : strong ] ) , which in the toric case is not only related to the geometry of the configuration of weights but also to number theoretic aspects .",
    "this concept is useful for the study of the existence of rational multivariate hypergeometric functions @xcite .    in section  [ sec : prelim ]",
    "we gather some preliminary results about embedded projective toric varieties and duality of projective varieties . in section  [ sec : orbits ] we characterize self - dual projective toric varieties in terms of the geometry of the action of the torus and we give precise assumptions under which self - dual projective varieties are precisely those with maximal defect . in section  [ sec : comb ] we give two ( equivalent ) combinatorial characterizations of self - duality . in section  [ sec : examples ] we collect several new examples of self - dual ( non smooth ) projective toric varieties . finally , in section  [ sec : strong ] we study strongly self - dual toric varieties .",
