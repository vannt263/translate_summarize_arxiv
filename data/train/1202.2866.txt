    "recently , the lhcb collaboration presented the first evidence for cp violation ( cpv ) in charm quark decays  @xcite .",
    "in particular , a difference between the time - integrated cp asymmetries in @xmath5 and @xmath2 @xmath6 has been reported , which is non - zero at @xmath7 .",
    "this measurement is consistent at about the @xmath8 level with the previous measurement from cdf  @xcite , and the previous world average from the heavy flavor averaging group  @xcite .",
    "the new world average , combining the lhcb result with previous measurements of @xmath9 and @xmath10 at babar  @xcite , belle  @xcite and cdf  @xcite , is  @xcite @xmath11 the interpretation of this measurement as a sign of new physics ( np ) requires a well - understood standard model ( sm ) calculation of this observable .",
    "simple arguments dictate that the sm contribution to direct cpv in @xmath12 decays must be both ckm suppressed and loop suppressed .",
    "concretely , the tree level decays @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( we implicitly include both @xmath12 and @xmath15 when discussing neutral @xmath3 decay modes ) only involve the first two quark generations , which can not access the cp violating kobayashi - maskawa ( km ) phase .",
    "the km phase does enter into the loop - induced gluon penguin diagram for singly - cabibbo suppressed @xmath12 decays that thus can provide both the required weak and strong phase difference relative to the leading sm tree amplitude .",
    "this implies that the sm prediction is loop suppressed as well as ckm suppressed , and the nave expectation for direct cpv in singly - cabibbo suppressed @xmath12 decays is parametrically given as @xmath16 .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that the lhcb evidence of cpv at about the percent level is a sign of new physics .    a precise sm calculation , however , is difficult to accomplish .",
    "although tree level and loop level sm contributions to the quark level processes @xmath17 and @xmath18 are readily calculated , the evaluation of the hadronic matrix elements @xmath19 , for example , is not easily performed . in the simplest approach , nave factorization ,",
    "the hadronic matrix elements are `` factorized '' into @xmath20 which is formally the leading term in the heavy charm quark limit .",
    "as the charm mass is close to @xmath21 , however , this approach suffers from large @xmath22 power corrections .",
    "in particular , so - called annihilation diagrams are ignored , where quarks are pair - produced from the vacuum to complete the @xmath23 or @xmath24 mesons , as are long - range qcd effects such as final state rescattering , where constituent @xmath25 quarks of a @xmath13 decay rescatter into @xmath26 quarks of a @xmath27 final state .",
    "alternative techniques such as the topological diagram approach organize decay and annihilation amplitudes according to weak current insertions and @xmath28 light quark flavor symmetry , and then try to extract amplitudes and phases directly from @xmath12 branching ratio data .    several recent papers have dicussed improved estimates for @xmath29 in the sm . in  @xcite , a nlo qcd factorization calculation is amended by an estimate of the effect of certain @xmath30 suppressed penguin amplitudes using @xmath12 branching ratio data . assuming an @xmath31 strong phase , the authors find the sm can potentially give @xmath32 . as their result admittedly neglects several effects which could alternatively reduce or enhance this estimate , they conclude that the measured value of @xmath0 could be reproduced in the sm .",
    "studies that inform magnitudes and phases of @xmath12 meson decay amplitudes directly from data were performed in  @xcite following a topological diagram approach .",
    "the authors of  @xcite arrive at a slightly smaller @xmath33 estimate , which remains , they highlight , more than 2@xmath34 away from the world average . in  @xcite ,",
    "the correlation between direct cpv in @xmath13 and @xmath35 and other @xmath3 meson decays is emphasized as an important cross - check of the lhcb result .    even though there is large uncertainty in the sm value of @xmath29 , it is nevertheless important and exciting to consider the possibility that we are seeing evidence of np . literature prior to the lhcb result emphasized the continued fact that cpv in the charm sector is considered an excellent probe of np beyond the sm  @xcite . among the most promising probes of cpv in the charm sector",
    "are observables in @xmath36 mixing  @xcite and singly cabibbo suppressed @xmath3 decays  @xcite .",
    "in fact , since flavor physics observables can probe energy scales much higher than those directly measured , we could potentially expect that np at the lhc would first be seen from its flavor effects at low energies and only later accessed directly .",
    "our goal is to investigate the possibility that np is indeed responsible for the large @xmath0 measurement and to outline the corresponding np parameter space consistent with all experimental constraints for a variety of np models .",
    "some recent work has discussed the np possibility both model independently  @xcite and in the context of various concrete np scenarios , including up - type flavor changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) , fourth - generation fermions , @xmath37-parity violating supersymmetry , and the mssm with nonstandard sources of flavor violation  @xcite .    our work differs from these previous analyses since we consider a much broader range of new np possibilities and apply a full gamut of experimental constraints , both from low energy experiments and collider searches . in particular , we systematically discuss models with a minimal set of new degrees of freedom with renormalizable couplings to the sm particles and are heavy enough such that their effects on the @xmath3 meson decays can be described by local operators .",
    "specifically , we consider models with new massive neutral gauge bosons that have flavor changing tree level couplings to quarks , models with extended scalar sectors , and models where the @xmath38 and @xmath39 decays are modified at the loop level by gluon penguins . as discussed in  @xcite , the loop induced @xmath40 chromomagnetic dipole operator ( here and throughout , @xmath41 refers to charm number except where noted ) is , on general grounds , expected to be the least constrained approach for generating large nonstandard effects in @xmath12 meson decays . on the other hand , the effects of four fermion operators that are , for example , induced by tree level exchange of flavor changing np degrees of freedom , are highly constrained by @xmath36 mixing data .",
    "as is well known , the @xmath36 constraints become more effective with heavier np degrees of freedom  @xcite , leading to the expectation that almost no np parameter space remains in models where four fermion operators are responsible for nonstandard direct cpv in @xmath5 and @xmath39 .",
    "our work shows to what extent this nave expectation holds true and identifies a few exceptions .",
    "we emphasize that each of the viable np possibilities that can accomodate a large @xmath0 motivates a further phenomenological study focusing on the allowed parameter space identified in this work , which we leave for a future study .    in  sec .",

    "given the existing bounds on the indirect cp asymmetries  @xcite , the lhcb measurement of @xmath0 is an excellent approximation of the difference in the direct cp asymmetries .    as already mentioned in the introduction , charm cpv in the sm is strongly cabibbo suppressed .",
    "furthermore , in the sm , direct cp violation in @xmath79 and @xmath2 decays comes from the interference of the tree level contribution with a loop suppressed penguin amplitude and correspondingly , @xmath80 . even though the weak phase of the sm penguin is large ( @xmath81 ) and assuming a maximal strong phase ,",

    "<S> in view of the recent lhcb measurement of @xmath0 , the difference between the time - integrated cp asymmetries in @xmath1 and @xmath2 decays , we perform a comparative study of the possible impact of new physics degrees of freedom on the direct cp asymmetries in singly cabibbo suppressed @xmath3 meson decays . </S>",
    "<S> we systematically discuss scenarios with a minimal set of new degrees of freedom that have renormalizable couplings to the sm particles and that are heavy enough such that their effects on the @xmath3 meson decays can be described by local operators . </S>",
    "<S> we take into account both constraints from low energy flavor observables , in particular @xmath4 mixing , and from direct searches . while models that explain the large measured value for @xmath0 with chirally enhanced chromomagnetic penguins are least constrained , we identify a few viable models that contribute to the @xmath3 meson decays at tree level or through loop induced qcd penguins . </S>",
