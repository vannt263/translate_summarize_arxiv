    "the importance of dust extinction in the galaxy has been recognized since early in this century when star - counting surveys revealed absorption of optical light by ` dark clouds ' ( barnard 1919 ) .",
    "it is fortunate that extinction correlates relatively well with reddening in the galaxy , because it is difficult enough to accurately measure either the distance to a typical astronomical source or its intrinsic luminosity  let alone both . but",
    "knowing the intrinsic color @xmath14 ( using an unobscured line of sight ) along with the observed @xmath15 color and a reddening - extinction law @xmath16 \\equiv r_ve(b - v)$ ] , one can correctly determine the distance of an object from its distance modulus , or vice versa .",
    "the value of @xmath17 varies markedly within the milky way ( @xmath18 ; mathis 1990 ) and among different galaxies ( @xmath19 ; falco et al .",
    "1999 ) , but a value of @xmath20 is useful for many estimates of galactic extinction .",
    "radiation from extragalactic objects is subject to extinction by dust both inside and outside of the galaxy .",
    "however , while extragalactic dust has received attention , our knowledge of its amount and properties is rather limited , because methods useful for estimating dust density in galaxies have proved less effective when extended to intergalactic space . for example , a number of groups have attempted to measure extinction by dust in clusters using background - object counting , and several claims of intracluster dust ( bogart & wagoner 1973 ; boyle , fong & shanks 1988 ; romani & maoz 1992 ) and extragalactic dust cloud detections ( wsozlek et al .",
    "1988 and references therein ) have been made , but even now these claims remain controversial ( see maoz 1995 ) .",
    "the strongest proposed limits on a diffuse distribution of intergalactic dust with a galactic reddening law have come from studies of the redshift evolution of the mean quasar spectral index ( e.g. wright 1981 ; wright & malkan 1988 ; cheng , gaskell & koratkar 1991 ) .",
    "these studies limit uniform dust of constant comoving density to have @xmath21 mag ( from wright & malkan 1988 ) , and are most sensitive to dust at @xmath13    while our knowledge of it is poor , intergalactic dust could have great cosmological importance , as it could affect results concerning the cosmic microwave ( cmb ) and cosmic infrared ( cib ) backgrounds , galaxy and quasar numbers at high @xmath22 , galaxy evolution , large - scale structure , etc .",
    "this paper discusses intergalactic dust chiefly in the context of its importance in measurements of the cosmological deceleration parameter ",
    "a subject discussed numerous times , first by eigenson ( 1949 ) and most recently in aguirre 1999  ( a99 ) .",
    "conditions in the diffuse intergalactic medium ( igm ) strongly disfavor dust formation , so whatever intergalactic dust exists is probably either the remnant of an early population iii epoch , or is formed in galaxies and removed by some mechanism .",
    "( the remaining possibility , that a substantial dust - forming population of extragalactic stars exists , is not considered here . )",
    "previous investigations of intergalactic dust have almost invariably assumed that it has properties similar to that of galactic dust ; but this assumption is not well justified . even among galaxies ,",
    "@xmath17 varies by a factor of four , and intergalactic dust may have creation , destruction , and selection mechanisms quite different from dust in galaxies . as argued in a99 , radiation pressure ejects grains with high opacity and a broad opacity curve more efficiently than other grain types . in  [ sec - dustdest ]",
    "i discuss results suggesting that small grains are preferentially destroyed by sputtering , both in the halos of galaxies ( during the ejection process ) and perhaps in the igm .    the large grains ,",
    "while having significant mass , give very small @xmath23 reddening , and actually have higher visual opacity ( per unit mass ) than dust which includes small grains .",
    "intergalactic dust of this type would not have been detected by quasar reddening surveys .",
    "current data , described in  [ sec - metals ] , suggests that the universe has been enriched to @xmath24 solar metallicity before @xmath25 .",
    "section  [ sec - snae ] shows that if a significant fraction of this metal is locked in dust that is distributed fairly uniformly , the dust extinction to @xmath25 can explain the observed progressive dimming of type ia supernovae ( riess et al .",
    "1998 ; perlmutter et al .",
    "1999 [ p99 ] ) without cosmic acceleration .",
    "the last section outlines ways in which the influence of the type of intergalactic dust described here can be tested , probably most cleanly by future supernova observations .",
    "although still very incomplete , our understanding of the evolution of cosmic metallicity has improved dramatically during the last few years .",
    "recent surveys ( see e.g. madau 1999 for a review ) of galaxies in the hubble deep field show that the comoving star formation rate ( sfr ) rises with redshift by a factor of ten to @xmath26 , past which it either declines or levels off . using the observed star formation rate and an assumed ratio of metal formation to star formation of 1/42 ( madau et al .",
    "1996 ) , the total cosmic metallicity ( neglecting any population iii contribution ) may be estimated by integrating over time the metal formation rate .",
    "figure  [ fig - sfr ] shows the result of this integration starting at @xmath27 , using curves from madau ( 1999 ) and steidel et al .",
    "these demonstrate that whether or not the sfr declines for @xmath28 , the current metal density is @xmath29 the estimates shown for @xmath30 agree with other results in the literature using similar methods : pettini ( 1999 ) estimates @xmath31 ; cen & ostriker ( 1999b ) calculate @xmath32 and @xmath33 .    very interestingly ,",
    "these estimates coincide with the ` fossil evidence ' presented by renzini ( 1997 ; 1998 ) .",
    "he argues that clusters are essentially closed systems which contain all of the metal produced by their stellar populations .",
    "stars of approximately solar metallicity comprise only a fraction @xmath34 of the total cluster gas mass , yet the remaining intracluster gas has @xmath35 solar metallicity .",
    "the associated metal production per unit of stellar mass can be written @xmath36z_\\odot$ ] ( renzini 1997 ) .",
    "unless stars in clusters produce metals much more efficiently than those in field galaxies , this figure should apply to the @xmath3 ( fukugita , hogan & peebles 1996 ) of stars in the universe , giving @xmath37 . moreover , if the cosmic gas density is @xmath38 , then the star formation efficiency of clusters well represents that of the universe , @xmath39 , further indicating that clusters are a fair sample .",
    "two obvious ratios link these numbers to estimates of intergalactic dust density : the fraction @xmath40 of all metal residing in the igm , and the fraction @xmath41 of the intergalactic metal locked in dust . at high @xmath22 ,",
    "the primary data bearing upon these ratios are observations of metal lines in quasar absorption spectra .",
    "pettini et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have measured the depletions of cr and zn in damped lyman-@xmath42 systems which pei , fall & hauser ( 1998 ) interpret as giving a dust / metal ratio of @xmath43 for all @xmath44 , similar to that of known galaxies .",
    "this suggests that even at high @xmath22 , source regions for the cosmic metallicity have @xmath45 . whether this applies to metal as it reaches the igm depends on the degree to which the ejection process destroys dust , or selectively ejects either gaseous metal or dust ( to be discussed in   [ sec - dustrem ] ) .",
    "observations of lower column density ly-@xmath42 absorbers give information about the gaseous metals in relatively cool regions of the igm . under some ( important ) assumptions about ionization corrections ,",
    "these line strengths indicates that areas with column density @xmath46 have @xmath47 solar metallicity , giving @xmath48 in gaseous metal if this enrichment is uniform . direct integration",
    "( effectively treating @xmath49 regions as pristine ) gives @xmath50 ( songaila 1997 ) . in light of the higher numbers derived from the sfr",
    ", the assumption that most of the cosmic metallicity resides in the ly-@xmath42 forest therefore leads to a ` missing metals ' problem , as noted by pettini ( 1999 ) and renzini ( 1999 ) , who argue that this discrepancy may indicate that most metals are located in hot halos around galaxies , in proto - clusters , or in a phase of the igm hotter than that which the ly-@xmath42 forest studies probe .",
    "cen & ostriker ( 1999a ) reach the same conclusion on separate grounds , arguing on the basis of both simple physical arguments and their numerical simulations that the bulk of universal baryons at low @xmath22 should be hot .",
    "the idea that the igm is fairly metal - rich gains more support from arguments that hold at low redshift .",
    "if enriched to solar metallicity , the current mass of stars and gas in known galaxies is sufficient to contain the metals expected at @xmath51 ( if most galaxies had already formed by then ) , but this does not hold for later epochs : as also argued by renzini ( 1998 ) , the cosmic metallicity at @xmath52 derived from cluster enrichment or by integration of the sfr can not be stored in currently observed galaxies , which can hold at most @xmath53 the remaining @xmath54 must exist in the intergalactic gas , in extended halos , or hidden in undetected galaxies ( which seems unlikely ) .",
    "this is exactly what one would expect on the basis of the metal distribution in clusters : renzini ( 1997 ) argues that while intracluster gas contains about three times as much metal as the cluster galaxies , there seems to be no compelling reason to expect that metal ejection is much more efficient in clusters than in the field , so most metals created from field galaxies should also lie outside them .    to avoid the conclusion that the universe has substantial intergalactic metallicity , it therefore seems that one would have to argue both that cluster galaxies eject metals more efficiently than field galaxies and have a different imf , and also accept that estimates of the sfr and/or the density of metal in galaxies are incorrect by at least a factor of two .    in summary",
    ", the density of intergalactic dust can be estimated at @xmath25 as @xmath55 with likely values of @xmath56 and @xmath57 . the argument that stars and gas in known galaxies can not contain these metals",
    "gives @xmath58 ; the larger number also corresponds to the value derived by assuming that field galaxies eject metal as cluster galaxies do .",

    "several ways in which galaxies can eject dust and metallic gas have been studied in the context of clusters ( for exactly the same reason ) , but it rather unclear which mechanism is dominant .",
    "the density of intracluster gas is high enough that ram - pressure stripping of galactic gas may be efficient ( e.g. fukumoto & ikeuchi 1996 ; gunn & gott 1972 ) in clusters , but it would be much less effective for a galaxy in the general igm",
    ". the removal of gas by supernova - driven winds has been widely discussed , and detailed simulations have been performed investigating this effect in large starburst galaxies ( suchkov et al .",
    "1994 ) and in dwarves ( mac low & ferrara 1998 ) . it is widely thought that galactic winds also remove gas from ellipticals ( e.g. david , forman & jones 1990 ) . gnedin ( 1998 ) has claimed that mergers provide the dominant metal removal mechanism , at least for @xmath59 finally , dust removal ( without metallic gas ) by radiation pressure can be fairly efficient even for present - day spirals ; starburst galaxies with higher luminosities would be correspondingly more effective . in this section",
    "i will concentrate on radiation pressure as the dominant dust expulsion mechanism because the effects on the dust have been investigated most carefully in that scenario ; but i will discuss the other mechanisms briefly .",
    "the dynamical evolution of a dust grain in a spiral galaxy is governed primarily by the radiation pressure , gravity , the viscous gas drag and the magnetic lorentz force .",

    "shustov & vibe stress that only dust starting somewhat above the disk can escape , but this does not imply that dust ejection is inefficient : in their model , the dust expulsion rate is up to @xmath70 , which in a hubble time exceeds the entire metal content of the galaxy and gives @xmath71 of order @xmath72 , even assuming a constant sfr .",
    "most recently , davies et al .",

    "notably , davies et al . still estimate that up to @xmath73 of the dust formed in spirals may be ejected , and even calculate an estimate of @xmath74 mag of intergalactic extinction across a hubble distance .",
    "all studies of radiation pressure driven dust removal have noted the importance of magnetic fields on grain dynamics but have ( effectively ) neglected them in their calculations , with the following justifications given :    * magnetic field lines are only sometimes parallel to the disk , and only on large scales ( all studies ) .",
    "* grains are charged only part of the time ( ferrara et al .",

    "( chiao & wickramasinghe 1972 ; ferrara et al .",

    "; ferrara et al . 1999 and references therein ) .",
    "however the dust escapes the disk , its presence proves that while magnetic fields are potentially important and currently impossible to model in detail , they can not be perfectly effective at dust confinement . on the other hand , this does not prove that dust can fully decouple from the gas .",
    "while dust expelled by radiation pressure could not carry a significant gas mass with it , other metal expulsion mechanisms probably remove dust along with gas .",
    "al . ( 1999 ) have presented observations of dust outflows in three nearby starburst galaxies , concluding that the ` superwinds ' driving these outflows can impart near - escape velocity on the dust , and that up to @xmath75 of the dust mass of these galaxies could be lost in the observed outflows alone .",

    "this figure assumes a constant sfr and the authors estimate that the enrichment is likely to be ten times higher with a more realistic sfr .",
    "supernova - driven winds might also eject dust from ellipticals .",
    "vereshchagin , smirnov & tutukov ( 1989 ) estimate that the ratio of galactic wind force to gravitational force on a grain of radius @xmath77 is @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the wind velocity and @xmath42 is the specific mass ejection rate for the wind in the galaxy . for @xmath80 ( applicable for the present epoch ; vereshchagin et al .",

    "essentially the same argument would apply to grains subject to winds in spirals , so whether dust lies in relatively cool outflows or is exposed to the wind itself , it is difficult to see how it could avoid being driven out with the metallic gas .",

    "this brief survey of metal ejection mechanisms suggests that it is difficult to efficiently remove metallic gas from galaxies without also removing dust ( although the converse of this would not be true if radiation pressure is the dominant ejection mechanism ) .",
    "rough estimates of the ejection efficiencies show that metal ejection rates sufficient to account for the enrichment of the igm estimated in  [ sec - metals ] are reasonable . while dust probably accompanies gas as it leaves",

    "a key result of the investigations by both ferrara et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and shustov & vibe ( 1995 ) is that grain destruction due to sputtering by hot halo gas is relatively insignificant for grains of @xmath86 but very effective for grains with @xmath87 while @xmath67 grains lose only @xmath88 in radius , the small grains are completely destroyed on a timescale of @xmath89 myr .",
    "the sharp difference arises because for sputtering at fixed gas temperature and grain velocity the destruction timescale @xmath90 ( draine & salpeter 1979a ) , and because small grains are more affected by gas drag yet less propelled by radiation pressure , hence move more slowly through the halo .",
    "more effective in @xmath91 grains than for @xmath92 shustov & vibe conclude from their calculations that the grains escaping intact from galaxies will have sizes @xmath93 for graphite particles and @xmath94 for silicate particles .",
    "these conclusions depend on assumptions about the density , temperature , and extent of the galactic halos , but the fact that both groups obtain similar results suggests that the minimal grain size surviving expulsion is probably of order @xmath95    the efficiency of dust destruction in other metal removal processes has not been calculated in detail and is difficult to estimate . dust driven out by winds would be vulnerable to sputtering by the halo gas as well as by the faster moving wind , though it will be somewhat shielded if embedded in cool clumps of gas . to estimate the effect of the wind ,",
    "let us assume a mass loss rate @xmath96 ( in solar masses / yr ) due to a wind leaving the galaxy radially with velocity @xmath79 .",
    "the effect of this wind would be similar to the effect of a hot gas of temperature @xmath97 and ( proton ) number density @xmath98 . for @xmath99 and @xmath100 kpc ,",
    "this gives @xmath101 k and @xmath102 using draine & salpeter s ( 1979a ) sputtering rate for graphite in this temperature range , this corresponds to a lifetime of @xmath103 this is comparable to the ejection timescale , so this sputtering could be important but is unlikely to completely destroy the dust .",
    "grain - grain collisions provide another important dust destruction mechanism in galaxies and might be important in the early stages of the ejection process .",
    "for example , grain - grain collisions in supernova shocks can efficiently shatter large grains into smaller ones ( e.g. jones , tielens & hollenbach 1996 ) , so if supernova blowout removes dust , there is a danger that shocks from the same supernovae might shatter the large grains before the dust is expelled .",
    "shocks may also play an important role in mergers . on the other hand ,",
    "it is unclear whether the dust observed in the ism is representative of dust which has just formed , or already been shock - processed , or some steady - state between the two .",
    "specifically , there is evidence for the formation of large grains in novae ( shore et al .",
    "1994 ) , and possibly in supernovae ( see wooden 1997 and pun et al . 1995 ) , and grains are presumably larger in molecular clouds where high values of @xmath17 are measured .",
    "it may be , then , that pre - shock grains tend to be somewhat larger , and the mrn distribution is more characteristic of grains after significant shattering has occurred .",
    "the assumption of this paper is that dust leaving its progenitor galaxy will have an grain size distribution characteristic of dust in the ism . in the absence of significant shattering , this is probably conservative , since a significant fraction of dust is contained in dense clouds with high @xmath17 ( e.g. kim , martin & hendry 1994 ) .",
    "[ sec - dustdest ]      rather little is known about the destruction of dust in the igm .",
    "schmidt ( 1974 ) estimates that soft cosmic rays would provide the most efficient destruction , but can not determine whether or not the destruction time would exceed the hubble time ; moreover , draine & salpeter ( 1979b ) find that cosmic rays are unimportant dust destroyers in the galaxy ( where they should be at least as effective as in the igm ) .",
    "the hot gas component of the igm , however , could sputter grains effectively , even at low density . using again draine & salpeter s ( 1979a ) estimate , while their rates are somewhat higher for silicates and somewhat lower in both materials for @xmath104k . ]",

    "the hubble time ( for @xmath108 ) is @xmath109 , suggesting the efficient destruction of grains for which @xmath110 the clumping factor ( i.e. the overdensity felt by a ` typical ' grain ) is quite uncertain , but the simulations of cen & ostriker ( 1999b ) , which numerically track the distribution of metallicity , indicate that at @xmath25 , the mean universal metallicity approaches the metallicity of @xmath111 regions",
    ". regions of much higher overdensity do not have much higher metallicity and hence can not contain most of the metals  for example , @xmath112 regions have only about twice the metallicity , so dense ` subregions ' can contain only about 20% of the metals in @xmath111 regions . if a ` typical ' grain experiences @xmath111 , then @xmath113 for @xmath114 grains and @xmath115 for @xmath116 grains .",
    "this is suggestive ( but only suggestive ) that sputtering by hot intergalactic gas might provide yet another mechanism by which grains of @xmath117 might be selectively destroyed .",
    "finally , note that the low mean dust density in the igm and in extended galaxy halos would strongly suppress the grain - grain collisions thought to shatter large grains into small ones in the galaxy gives the dust optical depth through the halo of a galaxy .",

    "such a distribution would be insignificantly affected by removal of the small or large - size portions , so intergalactic dust would have properties exemplified by the large core / mantle grains ( these grains will redden less than the full three - component model , but only slightly ) . on the other hand , it seems that there are good reasons to expect a power - law grain size distribution ( biermann & harwit 1979 ; mathis & whiffen 1989 )",

    "the duley , jones & williams ( 1989 ) model assumes a bimodal grain - size distribution : small silicate core / graphite coated grains provide uv extinction and the @xmath132 bump , whereas an mrn distribution of cylindrical silicate grains provides extinction in the ir , with grey extinction in uv and optical . in this model , intergalactic dust ( composed of the large silicate grains ) would be significantly more grey than galactic dust , assuming that it can escape .",

    "elongated grains are somewhat more grey than spherical grains of the same mass , giving some additional support to the general assumption that there is a significant grey sub - component to interstellar dust .    while a different grain model might predict a different effect of destroying small grains , it is also true that any viable grain model must be capable of accommodating values of @xmath150 , since such values are in fact observed .",
    "large grains seem to be a necessary component of grain models which match the observed extinction laws ( kim et al .",

    "thus the stated ( more stringent ) limits on systematic reddening do not apply , as long as the dispersion in brightness and/or color is dominated by factors other than extinction .",

    "the model of a99 predicted that cluster dust should be more grey than galactic dust ; the arguments of this paper reinforce this prediction .",
    "the intracluster gas destroys dust efficiently ; since sputtering destroys small grains more efficiently than large grains , it is likely that whatever grains survive in clusters are large , and thus supply grey opacity ( this may help explain the controversy surrounding the existence on intracluster dust ) .",
    "determination of the extinction curve of dust in clusters ( if dust indeed exists ) would be an important test of the key idea of the intergalactic dust model , although grey dust in clusters would not necessarily imply that dust in the diffuse igm is also grey .",
    "dust confined to galactic halos might also be detectable by its ir emission or by studies of objects seen through the halo .",
    "zaritsky ( 1994 ) has presented preliminary evidence for halo dust in ngc 2835 and ngc 3521 at @xmath237kpc using @xmath224 reddening ; if confirmed this would be an important dust component , as the inferred mass is large .",
    "as discussed in  [ sec - metals ] , fairly strong arguments suggest that the universe currently has @xmath238 in metals .",
    "this metal can not all be contained in the stars and gas in known galaxies , so unless metals are well hidden in unobserved galaxies , a metal density @xmath239 should exist in the more uniform igm or in extended halos . moreover , most of this metal was probably in place by @xmath155 .",
    "some fraction @xmath41 of this metal must be in dust .",
    "there are several good reasons to expect that the grain size distribution of this dust should be different than for dust in galaxies : ( 1 ) ejection by radiation pressure favors higher opacity , less reddening grains ( a99 ) . within the dl model ,",
    "this means large grains are preferentially ejected .",
    "( 2 ) as dust leaves galaxies ( where it is almost certainly created ) , small grains are preferentially destroyed by sputtering .",
    "this preferential destruction occurs also in the igm , but the efficiency is rather uncertain .",
    "( 3 ) small grains are generally assumed to form from the shattering of larger grains .",
    "this shattering will not occur in the igm due to the low densities , nor can small grains grow from the vapor .",
    "the principal assumption of this paper ( supported by what detailed calculations are available ) is that very small dust grains leaving the galaxy  comprising a fraction @xmath240 of the total dust density  are removed from the grain - size distribution , while large grains are not .",

    "uniformly distributed dust of constant comoving density in an @xmath157 open universe provides an extinction to @xmath11 of @xmath244 hence it can account for the dimming of type ia supernovae at @xmath25 in a way fully consistent with observations .",
    "the fact that the expected dust density of @xmath245 is so close to the density required is very interesting . according to these estimates",
    "( see also   [ sec - metals ] and  [ sec - dustdens ] ) it is possible , but rather unlikely , that there is sufficient dust ( @xmath246 ) to allow compatibility with a closed , matter - dominated universe .",
    "the arguments of this paper show that there may be an intergalactic dust component which is important yet has evaded earlier attempts at its discovery ; from this point of view the supernova observations are telling us not about cosmic acceleration , but about cosmic opacity .",
    "if the arguments of this paper are substantially correct , an intergalactic dust distribution of some magnitude is inevitable , so it is worth pointing out the chief caveats ( which maintain rough consistency with other observations ) under which the obscuration would not be sufficient to to account for the supernova dimming :    * both the sfr argument and the cluster enrichment argument may predict cosmic metallicity several times the true value . in this case",
    "most metal could be locked in galaxies .",
    "taking this view , however , probably also requires one to assume that cluster galaxies both have a different imf and eject metals more efficiently than field galaxies do .",
    "* a large population of unobserved but compact objects such a low surface brightness galaxies could contain a large fraction of the cosmic metallicity .",
    "this would , however , also fail to explain the cluster observations . *",
    "the draine & lee model may not accurately characterize dust , so the effect of small grain destruction on the opacity curve may be significantly different than assumed here .",

    "* dust of all sizes may be efficiently destroyed in the diffuse igm or as it leaves galaxies . while total grain destruction does not seem to be quantitatively supported in the dl model , it is certainly plausible , and would probably be the case if grains are very fluffy , high filling - factor composites .",
    "it is unlikely that the issue can be cleanly decided on the basis of the above points or by the current supernova data ( i.e. limits on dispersion or reddening ) ; on the other hand , future supernova results can rule decisively . statistically robust deviation of the magnitude - redshift curve of @xmath229 supernovae from the dust prediction would argue strongly for the interpretation of the dimming as cosmic acceleration and for the relative unimportance of grey intergalactic dust .",
    "clear evidence of , for example , systematic ( rest frame ) @xmath247 reddening would argue strongly for dust .",
    "if future observations show that intergalactic dust is indeed important , observations of type ia supernovae will be seen to have not only determined the deceleration parameter ( once dust is accounted for ) , but to have discovered a component of the universe that will have important implications for many future observations at high redshift .",
