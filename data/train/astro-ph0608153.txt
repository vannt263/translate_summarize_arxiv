    "supernovae have emerged as the most promising standard candles . due to their significant intrinsic brightness and relative ubiquity",
    "they can be observed in the local and distant universe .",
    "observational efforts to detect high - redshift supernovae have proved their value as cosmological probes .",
    "the systematic study and observation of these faint supernovae ( mainly type ia ) has been utilized to constrain the cosmic expansion history @xcite .",
    "light emitted from any celestial object is subject to lensing by intervening objects while traversing the large distances involved @xcite and the farther the light source , the higher its chance of being significantly lensed .",
    "apart from the fact that gravitational lensing can limit the accuracy of luminosity distance measurements @xcite , it can change the observed rate of supernovae as well .",
    "studying supernovae and their rates at high redshifts provide us with much needed information for constraining the measurements of the ellusive dark energy , as well as understanding the cosmic star formation rate and metal enrichment at high redshifts . in order to observe and , hence , study the faint high - redshift supernovae , one can raise the chance of observation by looking through clusters of galaxies or even massive galaxies ( see @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "these ` gravitational telescopes ' amplify the high - redshift supernovae and thereby increase the chance of their detection .",
    "however , this boost in observation is offset by the competing effect of depletion ( fig .",
    "1 ) , due to the field being spread by the deflector ( amplification bias ) . for an assumed lens model and a given field of view",
    "it is not obvious which effect dominates the observation of supernovae through the halo .",
    "the net result depends on the deflector and source parametrs as well as the observational setup @xcite .",
    "some research has been conducted on the feasibility of observing supernovae through cluster of galaxies ( see , for instance , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these studies have not taken into account how the morphology ( mainly the ellipticity ) of these clusters as gravitational telescopes could change the expected supernova rate . in this paper , we investigate whether introducing ellipticity into the mass distribution of the deflecting halos can affect the observation of supernovae . for this purpose , we use a pseudo elliptical navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) halo model with different values of ellipticity . throughout the paper",
    "we assume the so - called concordance cosmology where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 , with @xmath9 km s@xmath10mpc@xmath10 . in @xmath11 2",
    "we briefly go over the nfw model and show how an analytical formalism for a pseudo elliptical nfw mass profile can be introduced .",
    "strong lensing by thin deflectors as well as the way ellipticity can afffect the amplification is explained in @xmath11 3 .",
    "we present and discuss the results of our calculations in @xmath11 4 .",
    "high resolution n - body numerical simulations @xcite have indicated the existence of a universal density profile for dark matter halos resulting from the generic dissipationless collapse of density fluctuations .",
    "this density profile does not ( strongly ) depend on the mass of halo , on the power spectrum of initial fluctuations , or on the cosmological parameters .",
    "these halo models which are formed through hierarchical clustering diverge with @xmath12 near the halo center and behave as @xmath13 in its outer regions . inside the virial radius , this so - called nfw halo profile appears to be a very good description of the mass distribution of objects spanning 9 orders of magnitude in mass : ranging from globular clusters to massive galaxy clusters ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the nfw halo model is similar to hernquist profile @xcite that gives a good description of elliptical galaxy photometry .",
    "however , the two models differ significantly at large radii , possibly due to the fact that elliptical galaxies , countrary to the dark halos , are relatively isolated systems .",
    "the spherically symmetric nfw density profile takes the form of @xmath14 where @xmath15/(8\\pi g)$ ] is the critical density for closure of the universe at the redshift @xmath16 of the halo , @xmath17 is the hubble parameter at the same redshift , and @xmath18 is the universal gravity constant .",
    "the scale radius @xmath19 is the charactristic radius of the halo where @xmath20 is a dimensionless number refered to as the concentration parameter , and @xmath21 is a charactristic overdensity for the halo .",
    "the virial radius @xmath22 is defined as the radius inside which the mass density of the halo is equal to @xmath23 .",
    "it is then easy to see that @xmath24 therefore , nfw halos are defined by two parameters ; c , and either @xmath22 or @xmath25 . for any spherical nfw profile with a given mass , the concentration parameter c can be calculated using the fortran 77 code @xmath26 publicly available on the webpage of julio navarro ] .",
    "nfw halos can be shown to always produce odd number of images , as opposed to the commonly - used singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) model which produces either one or two images @xcite .",
    "although baryons are expected to isothermalize the matter distribution for halos of galaxy mass and below @xcite , taking all of the matter in the universe in isothermal spheres is a great oversimplification @xcite .",
    "it is , hence , reasonable to model halos ( at least massive halos ) with nfw mass profile instead of sis model .      here",
    "we present the introduced ellipticity @xmath27 in the circular lensing potential @xmath28 , assuming that angular position @xmath29 can be scaled by some scale radius / angle @xmath30 .",

    ", we follow @xcite who , in order to be able to analytically derive the convergence and shear , chose the following elliptical parameters : @xmath41 which for small values of ellipticity @xmath27 results in the same ellipticity along the @xmath42 as the standard elliptical model of @xmath43 with @xmath44 , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the semi - major and semi - minor axis of the projected elliptic potential , respectively .",
    "in the thin - lens approximation , we define @xmath47 as the optical axis and @xmath48 as the 3-dimensional newtonian potential , with @xmath49 .",
    "the so - called reduced 2-dimensional potential which is defined in the deflector plane is given by @xmath50 @xcite where @xmath51 is the speed of light , and @xmath52 is the angular position in the image plane .",

    "the number rate peaks at around @xmath119 as expected ( see fig .",
    "3 ) and dies off rapidly beyond that .",

    "the dominance of amplification bias as a result of the narrowing of the field in a region immediately behind the deflectors at the assumed redshifts is clear , as the gains fall below 1 .",
    "beyond that region amplification takes over and more ( lensed ) supernovae are observed .    in the absence of an intercepting halo",
    ", the number rate of the survey drops to zero at the redshift limit of the survey . with the deflecting halo present , the observed rate goes to zero at a higher redshift .",

    "how ellipticity changes the expected rate of observed supernovae we put the result of our calculations for different ellipticities for a given range of magnitude limits on the same plot .",

    "both halo masses , @xmath114 and @xmath115 are at redshift @xmath2 .",
    "figures 10 and 11 show the results of the same calculations with halos at redshifts @xmath127 and @xmath128 , respectively .",
    "the number rates in each figure increase smoothly up to the magnitude limit at which the survey is deep enough to detect the supernovae as far as the halo itself , e.g , @xmath129 for a concordance cosmology of ( @xmath130 ) = ( 0.3 , 0.7 , 0.67 ) .",
    "from that point on the rates increase very rapidly as the magnitude limit goes up . that is caused by the halo lensing and hence amplifying the supernovae which would otherwise be too dim to be observed .",
    "the relative differences depicted in these figures show that even at a magnitude limit of 25 , effect of ellipticity can not be ignored as it significantly changes the number / percentage of the observed supernovae ; for instance , the relative difference for @xmath5 with deflecting halo @xmath115 at redshift @xmath128 ( fig .",

    "it was shown that the farther the supernova survey probes , the more significant the effects of introduced ellipticity become .",
    "it should be noted that this work does not involve a broad range of mass profiles for the halos ( although we specify that the survey is limited to the virial area of the halo ) , nor does it address the much needed k - correction .",
    "our calculations are actually an oversimplification due to the fact that a large , massive halo like a galaxy cluster has substructure which consists of the member galaxies , as well as large clouds of gas . a more sophisticated lens model with ellipticity",
