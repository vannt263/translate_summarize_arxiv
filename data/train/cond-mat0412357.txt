    "to determine the pairing symmetry in unconventional superconductors is an interesting problem to understand the pairing mechanism of superconductivity .",
    "nowadays , it is widely accepted that the superconducting pair potential of high-@xmath4 cuprates has a @xmath5-wave symmetry in the bulk state .",
    "@xcite in order to determine the pairing symmetry , several phase - sensitive probes have been used @xcite . among them tunneling spectroscopy via andreev bound states ( abs s ) , @xcite help us to detect the internal phase in the pair potential .",
    "the formation of abs s at the fermi energy ( zero - energy ) , which is originated from the interference effect in the effective pair potential of @xmath5-wave symmetry through the reflection at the surface / interface , plays an important role when the angle @xmath6 between the lobe direction of the @xmath5-wave pair potential and the normal to the surface / interface is nonzero .",
    "@xcite in fact , the existence of abs s , which manifests itself as a distinct conductance peak at zero - bias in the tunneling spectrum ( zbcp ) , has been actually observed . up to now , the consistency between theories @xcite and experiments @xcite has been checked in detail .",
    "on the other hand , at the surface / interface of @xmath5-wave superconductor , it is known that the time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) may be broken .",
    "@xcite the reduction of the amplitude of @xmath5-wave pair potential near the surface / interface at low temperatures allows to induce the subdominant @xmath1-wave [ @xmath7-wave ] component in the imaginary part of the pair potential , i.e. , @xmath8+i@xmath1-wave @xcite [ @xmath8+i@xmath9-wave @xcite ] state .",
    "the amplitude of the induced @xmath1-wave component has a maximum at @xmath10 , which blocks the motion of quasiparticles .",
    "then , the energy levels of abs s shift from zero and the resulting tunneling spectra has a zbcp splitting even in zero magnetic field .",
    "the observation of the zbcp splitting without magnetic fields was believed to be one of the evidence for the broken time reversal symmetry states ( btrss ) .",
    "however , actual tunneling experiments still remain to be controversial .",
    "in fact , some groups @xcite have reported the zbcp splitting and they ascribed the origin of the zbcp splitting to the above btrss . at the same time , there are other experiments which do not show the zbcp splitting , and in these experiments , the zbcp survives even at low temperature .",
    "@xcite moreover , a critical current measurement of grain boundary junctions in high-@xmath4 cuprates concluded the absence of btrss at the interface .",
    "@xcite it has been studied in detail that the zbcp splitting in the tunneling spectra is sensitive to several factors : ( i ) transmission probability of the junctions , @xcite ( ii ) roughness at the interface , @xcite and ( iii ) effect of impurity scattering in normal metals or superconductors .",
    "@xcite recent studies by asano _",
    ", @xcite revealed that the existence of the impurity scattering can induce the zbcp splitting even without btrss .",
    "taking account of these situations , one can not conclude that the observation of the zbcp splitting by tunneling experiments directly indicate the presence of the btrss near the surface / interface .",
    "more recently , it is proposed that the induced @xmath1-wave component of the pair potential by proximity effect in normal metals ( n ) may enhance the magnitude of the subdominant @xmath1-wave component in @xmath0-wave superconductors ( d ) , which forms the btrss based on the analysis of the tunneling experiments .",
    "@xcite it is of great interest to study whether the induced @xmath1-wave component in the n side by the proximity effect has the influence on the subdominant component in the d side which forms the btrss . the proximity effect in the n / d junction without the btrss",
    "was theoretically studied by ohashi .",
    "@xcite it is shown that the amplitude of the subdominant i@xmath1-wave is the largest at @xmath3 . for @xmath11 with fully transparent junctions , local density of states ( ldos ) at the interface has a zero energy peak ( zep ) , the origin of which is not abs but the sign change of the pair potentials between n and d sides felt by andreev reflection of quasiparticles .",
    "it is necessary to study the interplay between the proximity effect and the btrss by changing the orientational angle @xmath6 . at the same time",
    ", it is also interesting to clarify the relationship between the different origin of two kinds of zep s .",
    "one is the zep which originates from the formation of abs for @xmath12 .",
    "the other is due to the proximity effect expected for fully transparent junctions for @xmath11 .",
    "@xcite    in the present paper , we study the proximity effect in n / d junctions on the basis of quasiclassical green s function methods .",
    "we assume attractive interelectron potentials which induce subdominant @xmath1-wave components in the n side as well as the d. the spatial dependencies of the pair potentials both in the n and d sides are determined self - consistently .",
    "the ldos at the interface of the n / d junctions are studied in detail by changing @xmath6 and the transparency of the junction . for @xmath3 ,",
    "the magnitude of the @xmath1-wave component is induced even in the n side , while the subdominant @xmath1-wave component which breaks trs exists near the interface on the d side .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , for @xmath2 , @xmath1-wave component is induced in the n side by the proximity effect with the increase of the transparency of the junction . the induced @xmath1-wave component in the n side and that in the d side do not break the trs .",
    "it is revealed that the proximity induced @xmath1-wave component in the n side does not enhance the btrss in the d side .",

    "in this paper , we have studied quasiparticle properties in the n / d junctions , in the presence of the proximity effect as well as the btrss in the d side .",

    "the subdominant @xmath1-wave component which breaks trs appears near the ( 110 ) interface in low transparent cases . in the n side ,",
    "subdominant imaginary @xmath1-wave component is induced near the interface @xcite .",
    "the resulting ldos at the interface in the n side has the zep or its splitting depending on the transparency of the junction .",
    "these results are consistent with previous theoretical works .",
    "@xcite    \\ii ) for ( 100 ) oriented junction , the subdominant @xmath1-wave component becomes real number and does not break trs @xcite . with the increase of the transparency of the junction ,",
    "the magnitude of the @xmath1-wave component in the n side is enhanced by the proximity effect .",
    "for fully transparent case , the ldos has very sharp zep due to the formation of zero energy states .",
    "this zep originates from the fact that quasiparticles feel different sign of the pair potentials between the n and d sides through andreev reflection .",
    "\\iii ) for @xmath121 , the spatial dependencies of the pair potentials become very complicated .",
    "the resulting ldos has a wide variety . for high barrier limit",
    ", the ldos has the zep splitting .    in the light of our results , although the penetration of the pair potential into the n side by the proximity effect is expected for ( 100 ) oriented junctions , the subdominant @xmath1-wave components both in the n and d sides are real numbers .",
    "thus , the btrss is not formed in the ( 100 ) junctions .",
    "the present results are inconsistent with previous prediction based on tunneling experiment on high-@xmath136 cuprates by kohen _",
    "_ @xcite in order to understand their experimental results , we must seek for other possibilities .    in the present paper , we study proximity effect in n / d junctions in the ballistic limit . in the actual junctions , we can not neglect impurity scattering effect . to reply this issue , two of the present author present theoretical works of charge transport in n / d junctions in the presence of the abs where the n region is a diffusive metal .",
    "@xcite it is an interesting problem to extend the present theory in the diffusive regime based on the keldysh green s function formalism .",
    "@xcite although there are many works about abs s in unconventional superconductor junctions up to now , @xcite proximity effects both in the presence of induced pair potential in the n region and the abs s are not fully studied .",
    "recent study by lfwander is remarkable where the proximity effect is studied in the presence of both impurity scattering and induced subdominant component of the pair potentials .",
    "@xcite based on his detailed calculation , for ( 100 ) junction , a real combination of the proximity effect is always found . for ( 110 ) orientation , the @xmath1-wave component induced by the proximity effect in the n side breaks trs .",
    "@xcite these results are consistent with the present results .    as a future problem , to clarify the charge transport property in josephson junctions both in the presence of abs @xcite and proximity effect is interesting .",

    "<S> superconducting proximity effect in normal metal ( n ) / @xmath0-wave superconductor ( d ) junctions in the presence of attractive interelectron potentials which can induce subdominant @xmath1-wave pair potentials both in n and d sides , is studied based on the quasiclassical green s function theory , where spatial dependencies of the pair potentials are determined self - consistently . in the n / d junctions with orientational angle with @xmath2 , the @xmath1-wave component is induced in the n side by the proximity effect only for high transparent case , where the induced @xmath1-wave components in both the n and d sides do not break the time reversal symmetry ( trs ) . for fully transparent case </S>",
    "<S> , the resulting local density of states has a very sharp zero - energy peak ( zep ) , the origin of which is the sign change of the pair potentials felt by the quasiparticles between the @xmath1-wave component in the n side and @xmath0-wave dominant component in the d side through andreev reflections . on the other hands , for @xmath3 , the subdominant @xmath1-wave component which breaks the trs appears near the interface . besides </S>",
    "<S> , for lower transparent cases , the subdominant imaginary @xmath1-wave component is also induced near the interface in the n side . </S>",
    "<S> the proximity induced @xmath1-wave component in the n side does not enhance the magnitude of the @xmath1-wave component of the pair potential which break the trs in the d side . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting ldos at the interface has the zep or its splitting depending on the transparency of the junction . </S>"
