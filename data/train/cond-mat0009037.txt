    "in the recent few years a generalized hubbard model with correlated hopping has been used widely to describe strongly correlated electron systems ( see papers  @xcite and references therein ) ; the electron - hole asymmetry is a property of such a generalized hubbard model as a result of the dependence of hopping integral on occupation of the sites involved in the hopping process .",
    "recently , this model has been extended to the case of a doubly orbitally degenerate band  @xcite .",
    "the generalized hubbard model has much richer properties than the well - known hubbard model  @xcite , and an usage of the electron - hole asymmetry conception allows to interpret the peculiarities of physical properties of narrow - band materials which are not explained by the hubbard model .",
    "in particular , the experimentally observed electron - hole asymmetries of metal oxides conductivity , of cohesive energy of transition @xmath0-metals and of superconducting properties of high - temperature superconductors have been explained within the generalized hubbard model with correlated hopping in papers  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite respectively .    despite the fact that phase diagram of generalized hubbard model has been studied in works  @xcite ,",
    "researchers pay no attention to a determination of the model phase diagram in a paramagnetic state under the action of external influences , in particular pressure - temperature phase diagram .",
    "this task is related directly to the problem of metal - insulator transition description under the action of external pressure and temperature , namely the constructed pressure - temperature phase diagram of the model would allow to describe the observed metal - insulator transitions in narrow - band materials with changing of pressure and temperature .",
    "an interest to such transitions is caused by the theoretical point of view as well as the rich possibilities of its application ( see , for example , monograph  @xcite and review  @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , the goal of the present paper , being a continuation of previous work  @xcite where the temperature - induced metal - insulator transition was studied , is to determine the pressure - temperature phase diagram of generalized hubbard model with correlated hopping in a paramagnetic state at half - filling . on basis of this phase diagram",
    "we describe metal - insulator transition under the action of external pressure and temperature .",
    "taking into account an external hydrostatic pressure @xmath1 we write the model hamiltonian in the following form  @xcite ( in this connection see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath2 where @xmath3 are the nearest - neighbours sites , @xmath4 is the chemical potential , @xmath5 is the creation ( destruction ) operator of an electron of spin @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) on @xmath8-site ( @xmath9 denotes spin projection which is opposite to @xmath6 ) , @xmath10 is the number operator of electrons of spin @xmath6 on @xmath8-site , @xmath11 is the intra - atomic coulomb repulsion , @xmath12 , with @xmath13 being the matrix element of electron - ion interaction , @xmath14 are the correlated hopping integrals ( matrix elements of electron - electron interaction ) , the primes at the sums in hamiltonian  ( 2.1 ) signify that @xmath15 .",
    "the latest term of the hamiltonian has meaning of the elastic energy of a uniformly deformed crystal , where @xmath16 is the `` initial '' ( purely lattice ) bulk elasticity , @xmath17 is the number of lattice sites , @xmath18 is the relative change of the volume in unifrom strain ( @xmath19 is the initial unit - cell volume ) . formulating the hamiltonian we have used the result of paper  @xcite :",
    "the dependence of a bandwidth @xmath20 on relative change of the volume @xmath21 in unifrom strain can be written in the form @xmath22 , where @xmath23 ( @xmath24 is the number of nearest neighbours to a site ) , @xmath25 .",
    "we assume also that under the action of external pressure bandwidth changes only , and the matrix elements of electron - electron interaction ( the correlated hopping integrals and intra - atomic coulomb repulsion ) do not depend on relative change of the volume .    as in papers  @xcite , using generalized mean - field approximation  @xcite ( an analog of the projection operation ) in the green function method we obtain for a paramagnetic state at half - filling the energy gap width as @xmath26+{1\\over 2}(q_1+q_2 ) , \\\\ & & q_1=\\sqrt{\\left [ b(w-\\tilde{w})(1+\\alpha u)-u\\right]^2+[4dzt'(1+\\alpha u)]^2},\\\\   & & q_2=\\sqrt{\\left [ b(w-\\tilde{w})(1+\\alpha u)+u\\right]^2+[4dzt'(1+\\alpha u)]^2 } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the concentration of polar states ( holes or doublons ) which has been calculated in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xmath28 , @xmath29 ; @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the terms describing hopping of quasiparticles within the lower and upper hubbard bands ( hopping of holes and doublons ) respectively , @xmath32 describes a quasiparticle hopping between hole and doublon bands ( the processes of paired creation and destruction of holes and doublons ) .    according to the method proposed for the s(d)-f model in paper  @xcite ,",
    "the equilibrium value of relative change of the volume @xmath21 is determined from the condition of minimum of the thermodynamic gibbs potential @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the free energy . using the known identity @xmath35 , eq .",
    "( [ u1 ] ) for the parameter @xmath21 can be represented as @xmath36 with @xmath37 being hamiltonian  ( [ h_u ] ) . in the mean - field approximation passing to the space of quasi - momenta we get the following equation for relative change of the volume @xmath21 : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the parameter which determines the quantity @xmath40  ev@xmath41  @xcite .",
    "taking into consideration the fact that within the generalized mean - field approximation the first term of right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ u2 ] ) is equal to zero  @xcite at the point of metal - insulator transition , we obtain the relation between relative change of the volume @xmath21 and an external hydrostatic pressure @xmath1 as @xmath42 note that within the generalized hartree - fock approximation this equation is valid at the point of metal - insulator transition as well as in an insulating phase .    to determine pressure - temperature phase diagram of the model we use formula  ( [ en_gap_1 ] ) for the energy gap width and the expression for concentration of polar states calculated in ref  @xcite .",
    "let us consider , for instance , the mott - hubbard compound nis@xmath43 .",
    "this has two electrons half filling an @xmath44 band , the half - width of initial ( uncorrelated ) band of this crystal is @xmath45ev",
    "@xcite , and the initial unit - cell volume is @xmath46m@xmath47  @xcite .",
    "it shows the transition from the state of a paramagnetic insulator to the paramagnetic metal state at a hydrostatic external pressure of 46 kbar and room temperatures .",
    "thus the transition occurs for a decrease in volume of about 0.4% with no change in crystal structure  @xcite .",
    "it also becomes metallic on alloying with ni@xmath43se , and the behaviour of this system is discussed later in this section .    to calculate the model parameter @xmath11 we fix one of the points ( @xmath48kbar , @xmath49  k ) of the experimental curve in the phase diagram ( the dashed - line curve of figure  [ p_d ] ) and",
    "find the value of intra - atomic coulomb repulsion @xmath11 at which the theoretical calculations within the present model reproduce this point .",
    "thus , we obtain : @xmath50 for the correlated hopping parameters @xmath51 ( these values of @xmath52 correspond to the hubbard model ) , @xmath53 for @xmath54 , and @xmath55 at @xmath56 . using these values of the model parameters we find the values of external hydrostatic pressure and temperature at which energy gap width is equal to zero ( i.e. metal - insulator transition occurs ) .",
    "the pressure - temperature phase diagram of metal - insulator transition determined within generalized hubbard model with correlated hopping for nis@xmath43 in comparison with the experiment ( the dashed curve ) : @xmath57 ( the upper curve ) ; @xmath56 ( the middle curve ) ; @xmath54 ( the lower curve ) .",
    "pi ( pm ) denotes paramagnetic insulating ( metallic ) phase .",
    "[ p_d ]    the determined in this way pressure - temperature phase diagram of the model ( figure  [ p_d ] ) describes metal - insulator transitions in a paramagnetic state under the action of external pressure and temperature in nis@xmath43 , namely the constructed phase diagram describes metal - to - insulator transition with increasing temperature , and insulator - to - metal transition under the action of external pressure .",
    "comparison of this theoretically determined phase diagram with the phase diagram of the compound nis@xmath43 shows a good agreement between the theory and experiment . besides",
    ", the theoretical calculations within the model reproduce the experimental data of paper  @xcite which point out a presence of the energy gap width @xmath58 in the ground state of nis@xmath43 and in absence of an external pressure .",
    "the phase diagram shows that taking into account correlated hopping allows much better description of these experimental data than the hubbard model ; this testifies also much better physics of the present model and the important role of correlated hopping .",
    "analogous phase diagrams can be constructed for the other compounds : ( v@xmath59cr@xmath60)@xmath43o@xmath61  @xcite , nis@xmath62se@xmath60  @xcite and y@xmath59ca@xmath60tio@xmath61  @xcite exhibiting such metal - insulator transitions .",
    "for example , the materials ( v@xmath63cr@xmath64)@xmath43o@xmath61 shows a metal - insulator transition at a hydrostatic external pressure of 13 kbar and room temperatures ; the transition occurs for a small decrease in volume of about 1% with no change in crystal structure  @xcite . in ( v@xmath59m@xmath65)@xmath43o@xmath61 ( with @xmath66 ) the addition of ti@xmath67 ions to v@xmath43o@xmath61 leads to insulator - to - metal transition , whereas the addition of cr@xmath67 ions results in metal - to - insulator transition .",
    "the simplest explanation is that the substitution of v@xmath67 ion for cr@xmath67 ion leads to a band narrowing ; the cr@xmath67 ion is a localized impurity and it deletes a state from the @xmath0-bands , deleting a state is equivalent to a band narrowing or an external pressure decreasing  @xcite which drives the system towards the insulating phase . likewise the addition of ti@xmath67 impurities is equivalent to an external pressure increasing .    in the mott - hubbard compound",
    "nis@xmath62se@xmath60 electron hoppings between the sites of ni occur by the chalcogenide sites ( this is caused by peculiarities of the pyrite crystal structure  @xcite ) , the substitution of s@xmath68 ion for se@xmath68 ion in nis@xmath43 leads to an increase of wave functions overlapping , consequently the probability of an electron hopping increases which is equivalent to a band broadening or an external pressure increasing .",
    "therefore , the pressure - temperature phase diagram constructed for nis@xmath43 can describe the experimental composition - temperature phase diagram  @xcite of the compound nis@xmath62se@xmath60 .",
    "note also that to construct phase diagram of the system y@xmath69ca@xmath70tio@xmath61 we have to generalize the previous results obtained at half - filling to the case of a non half - filled band because this compound is characterized by such a band  @xcite .    in conclusion , in the present paper pressure - temperature phase diagram of the generalized hubbard model with correlated hopping in a paramagnetic state at half - filling has been determined .",
    "the constructed phase diagram describes metal - to - insulator transition with increasing temperature , and insulator - to - metal transition under the action of external pressure .",
    "comparison of this theoretically determined phase diagram with experimental data , in particular with the phase diagram of the compound nis@xmath43 shows a good agreement between the theory and experiment .",
    "we have found that taking into account correlated hopping allows much better description of these experimental data than the hubbard model ; this testifies also much better physics of the present model and the important role of correlated hopping .",
    "the determined pressure - temperarure phase diagram of the model can explain paramagnetic region of the phase diagrams of the transition metal compounds : the systems nis@xmath62se@xmath60 and ( v@xmath59cr@xmath60)@xmath43o@xmath61 , calcium doped ytio@xmath61 .",
