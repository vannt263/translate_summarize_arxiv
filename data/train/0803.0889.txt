    "cosmology is now becoming a precision science , and cosmological observations can give us a lot of information for our understanding of the universe .",
    "moreover , the interplay between cosmology and particle physics in various contexts has also been discussed vigorously .",
    "one of such examples is the effective number of neutrino species @xmath0 . although collider experiments such as lep have measured the number of light active neutrino types to be @xmath8 @xcite , it is important to cross - check this value because cosmological measurements may lead to different value",
    ". this could be due to an extra radiation component which is predicted by some models of particle physics such as sterile neutrinos ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , or due to incomplete thermalization of neutrinos in the low - scale reheating universe in which the reheating temperature @xmath9 can be as low as @xmath10mev and @xmath0 is predicted to be less than three @xcite .",
    "if such a non - standard ingredient exists , it can affect big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , large scale structure ( lss ) and so on ; thus precise cosmological observations can probe these scenarios through the effective number of neutrino species .",
    "constraints on @xmath0 have been investigated in the literature using the information of cmb and lss , sometimes with priors on the hubble constant , cosmic age and helium abundance @xcite .",
    "although cmb in general can constrain various quantities severely , since the effects of @xmath0 on cmb are degenerate with some cosmological parameters , the studies so far have combined cmb data with some other observations such as lss to obtain a sensible constraint on @xmath0 . however ,",
    "when one uses the data from lss , constraints can become different depending on how one treats non - linear correction / bias on small scales for the matter power spectrum @xcite .",
    "furthermore , different lss data seem to give different constraints on @xmath0 @xcite . regarding the prior on the hubble constant @xmath11 , as is summarized in ref .",
    "@xcite , it can yield some constraints on @xmath0 when combined with cmb data ( without lss data ) @xcite , but they depend on the @xmath11 prior adopted .",
    "one may consider that we can use the usually assumed prior on the hubble constant based on the result by freedman et al .",
    "@xmath12 @xcite , but another group reported a somewhat lower value as @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "if the lower value for @xmath11 is adopted as the prior , a resulting constraint on @xmath0 would be different .",
    "having these considerations in mind , it is desirable to investigate a constraint on @xmath0 without these kind of uncertainties .    in this paper",
    ", we study a constraint on @xmath0 from cmb experiments alone . by making the analysis of cmb data alone",
    ", we can avoid such subtleties as the galaxy - bias / non - linear corrections and the value for the prior on the hubble constant .",
    "however , as is mentioned above , the effects of @xmath0 are strongly degenerate in cmb with other cosmological parameters such as energy density of matter , the hubble constant , and the scalar spectral index , and , in fact , we could not obtain a meaningful bound only with wmap3 @xcite .",
    "recent wmap5 alone analysis gives a better constraint but it still can not give an upper bound @xcite . as we will discuss later , the degeneracy is significant up to about the 2nd/3rd peak of the cmb power spectrum where the observation of wmap has precisely measured . to break this degeneracy to some extent , it would be helpful to have the information at higher multipoles where signals unique to relativistic neutrinos are expected to appear @xcite .",
    "recently , the data from acbar which probes cmb at higher multipoles than those of wmap has been updated @xcite . by using this data in addition to other small scale observations such as boomerang and cbi ,",
    "we can obtain a relatively severe constraint on @xmath0 which is comparable to that have been obtained previously with lss data .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we start with the discussion how @xmath0 affects the cmb power spectrum , which helps to understand our results for the constraint on @xmath0 . in section [ sec : current ] , we study the current constraint on @xmath0 using observations of cmb alone .",
    "we use the data from wmap5 , the recent acbar , boomerang and cbi .",
    "furthermore , we forecast the constraint from the future planck experiment . in the final section ,",
    "we summarize our results and discuss its implications for some models of particle physics / the early universe .",
    "the effective number of neutrino species @xmath0 represents the energy density stored in relativistic components as @xmath14 \\rho_\\gamma\\ ] ] where @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are energy densities of photons , three species of massless active neutrinos and some possible extra radiation components , respectively . in this paper",
    ", we assume that neutrinos are massless and have no chemical potential .",
    "for the case with the standard three neutrino flavors without an extra relativistic component , the effective number of neutrino is @xmath18 where some corrections from the incomplete decoupling due to a slight interaction of neutrinos with electrons / positrons and finite temperature qed effect to the electromagnetic plasma are taken into account @xcite .",
    "any deviation of @xmath0 from this value implies that there exists an extra relativistic component and/or some non - standard thermal history takes place such as the low reheating temperature scenario .    to illustrate the effects of @xmath0 on cmb , we plot cmb power spectra for several values of @xmath0 in fig .",
    "[ fig : cl ] . other cosmological parameters",
    "are assumed as the mean values of wmap5 alone analysis for a power - law flat @xmath2cdm model . as seen from the figure , as we increase the value of @xmath0 ,",
    "the height of the 1st peak is strongly enhanced and the positions of acoustic peaks are shifted to higher multipoles . also , the amplitude on small scales ( higher multipoles ) is suppressed .",
    "below , we discuss where these changes are coming from .",
    "one of the main effects of @xmath0 comes from the change of the epoch of the radiation - matter equality . by increasing ( decreasing ) the value of @xmath0",
    ", the radiation - matter equality occurs later ( earlier ) .",
    "thus the increase ( decrease ) of @xmath0 gives an almost the same effect of the decrease ( increase ) of energy density of matter .",
    "one of noticeable features is that the height of the first acoustic peak is enhanced by increasing the value of @xmath0 .",
    "this is due to the early integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect in which fluctuations of the corresponding scale , having crossed the sound horizon in the radiation - dominated epoch are boosted by the decay of the gravitational potential .",
    "thus a larger amount of relativistic species drives the first peak higher .",
    "another effect is the shift of the position of acoustic peaks due to the change of the radiation - matter equality through the change of @xmath0 .",
    "the position of acoustic peaks is well captured by the so - called acoustic scale @xmath19 which is inversely proportional to the peak position and written as @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the comoving angular diameter distance to the last scattering surface and the sound horizon at the recombination epoch @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "although @xmath21 almost remains the same for different values of @xmath0 , @xmath22 becomes smaller when @xmath0 is increased .",
    "thus the positions of acoustic peaks are shifted to higher multipoles ( smaller scales ) by increasing the value of @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , since the position of the @xmath24-th peak can be roughly written as @xmath25 , separations of the peaks become also greater for larger @xmath0 .",
    "another important effect is free - streaming of ultrarelativistic neutrinos @xcite .",
    "the perturbation of ultrarelativistic neutrino propagates with the speed of light , which is faster than the sound speed of acoustic oscillations of photon - baryon fluid .",
    "the coupled photon - baryon component behaves to oscillate like a compressional fluid ; on the other hand , ultrarelativistic neutrinos free - stream to erase their fluctuations .",
    "these two components are coupled via gravity ; thus the fluctuations of photons can also be affected by the free - streaming of neutrinos , which results in the damping of the amplitude and the shift of the acoustic oscillations .",
    "the effects are significant on small scales where fluctuations of a given scale enter the horizon while the energy density of ultrarelativistic neutrinos takes a significant portion of that of the universe .",
    "although the effects of the standard cosmological parameters on the heights and positions of acoustic peaks are well known , here we discuss them in some phenomenological way including the effects of @xmath0 .",
    "for this purpose , we calculated the response of the heights and positions of the acoustic peaks to the change of the cosmological parameters up to the 5th peak around the fiducial values .",
    "as a fiducial parameter set , we take those of the mean value from wmap5-alone analysis for a power - law flat @xmath2cdm model .",
    "the shifts of the positions of acoustic peaks are @xmath26 where @xmath27 means the position of the @xmath28-th peak .",
    "@xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are energy densities of baryon and matter , the scalar spectral index , the primordial helium abundance and the normalized hubble constant .",
    "@xmath31 is defined at the wave number @xmath34mpc@xmath35 .",
    "the positive derivatives of the peak positions with respect to @xmath0 demonstrate the decrease in @xmath36 due to the increase in @xmath0 .",
    "the responses of the heights of acoustic peaks to the change of various cosmological parameters are @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "since @xmath33 gives only a negligible change to the height of the peaks , we omit it . by increasing the value of @xmath0",
    ", the height of the 1st peak is enhanced due to the early isw effect , as previously mentioned . for the third and the higher peaks ,",
    "the heights are damped more by increasing @xmath0 , which is inferred from the negative coefficients .",
    "this is due to the effect of free streaming of neutrinos @xcite .",
    "in addition , for later convenience , we also show the derivatives of the peak heights relative to the first peak height following refs .",
    "@xcite . here ,",
    "@xmath39 for @xmath405 .",
    "they are useful quantities when we interpret degeneracies since the dependence on the overall amplitude is cancelled out .",
    "in this section , we present our result for the constraint on @xmath42 from cmb alone .",
    "first , we give some details of our analysis .",
    "we use the cmb data of wmap5 @xcite , boomerang @xcite , cbi @xcite and acbar @xcite .",
    "we performed a markov chain monte calro ( mcmc ) analysis to obtain constraints on cosmological parameters using cosmomc code @xcite with some modifications which are described in the following .",
    "we explore a 9 dimensional parameter space which consists of @xmath29 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath31 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath32 and @xmath0 . here",
    ", @xmath43 is the energy density of dark matter , @xmath44 is the optical depth of reionization , @xmath45 is the acoustic peak scale @xcite , @xmath46 is the amplitude of primordial fluctuations and @xmath47 is the amplitude of thermal sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect which is normalized to the @xmath48 template from ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    ".the mean values , 68% and 95% limits of @xmath0 for several current cmb data sets and assumptions of @xmath32 .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > , > , > \" , ]     we would like in the end to comment on how our discussion so far can be affected by theoretical uncertainties in the recombination process @xcite . since the change of @xmath32 can influence the recombination process",
    ", its uncertainties might affect the cosmological parameter determination in some way .",
    "thus it may be worth mentioning here on the effects .",
    "for this purpose , we proceed with the same analysis as have been done in ref .",
    "@xcite but varying @xmath0 here .",
    "two parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 , which represent the uncertainties in the recombination modeling , are included among other free parameters .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein for more details ) .",
    "we impose top - hat priors , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , which are very conservative ones , to take into account the uncertainties in the recombination theory .",
    "we made the analyses for the two cases where @xmath32 is given from the bbn relation and @xmath32 is treated as a free parameter . in both cases , we found that the constraints on other cosmological parameters including @xmath0 are scarcely affected even by very conservative prior on @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the mean values are unchanged and errors increase only very slightly ( no more than 10% for any parameters other than @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) .",
    "therefore we can say that the uncertainties parametrized with @xmath49 and @xmath50 do not change much our results of the planck forecast discussed above .",
    "however , we would need more understanding of uncertainties in the recombination theory for the precise determination of cosmological parameters in future cmb surveys .",
    "we discussed the issue of probing the effective number of neutrino species @xmath0 from cmb data alone .",
    "although a constraint on @xmath0 has been investigated by many authors , in most analyses , some combinations of data set such as cmb+lss , cmb+@xmath11 , cmb+lss+@xmath11 have been used to constrain @xmath0 .",
    "this is partly because @xmath0 has severe degeneracies in wmap with some other cosmological parameters such as @xmath30 and @xmath33 ; thus @xmath0 can be more constrained by combining some data sets . however , when we combine data from lss , some subtleties can arise : a constraint from lss data depends on how we treat non - linear corrections / bias .",
    "furthermore , different galaxy data lead to slightly different constraints on @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , as for the hubble prior , the prior usually adopted is @xmath12 which is from the result of freedman et al @xcite .",
    "however , another group has reported somewhat different value as @xmath53 @xcite . since different priors on the hubble",
    "constant can give different results , in this respect , the constraint obtained by assuming some prior on @xmath11 should be regarded taking into account the above uncertainty .",
    "taking these issues into consideration , it may be interesting to study a constraint on @xmath0 removing such subtleties , which can be done by using cmb data alone .    in this paper , first we discussed the effects of @xmath0 on cmb and the issues of degeneracies with some other cosmological parameters .",
    "phenomenological descriptions of its effects on the heights and the positions of acoustic peaks were also given .",
    "then , in section [ sec : current ] , a constraint on @xmath0 was studied by using cmb data alone .",
    "we made use of the data from wmap5 , acbar , boomerang and cbi .",
    "as discussed there , although wmap measurement is very accurate , its precision is limited up to the 2nd peak/3rd peak .",
    "we have explicitly shown that the information up to the 2nd/3rd peak is not enough to constrain @xmath0 severely .",
    "this was demonstrated by making the analysis with wmap data alone , in which a sensible constraint can not be obtained .",
    "however , if we include the data on small scales , the degeneracies of @xmath0 with some other cosmological parameters can be removed to some extent ; then a stronger constraint can be obtained .",
    "in fact , on small scales , the amplitude is suppressed due to the free streaming effect by increasing @xmath0 , which is similar to the effects of @xmath32 through the diffusion damping .",
    "thus we have studied the constraint on @xmath0 assuming different priors on @xmath32 : adopting the bbn relation to derive @xmath32 for given @xmath0 and @xmath29 , assuming @xmath32 as a free parameter and usual fixing of @xmath54 . depending on the prior , the constraint slightly changes .",
    "we obtained the 95 % limits as @xmath55 for the case with @xmath32 being free , @xmath56 for @xmath32 being fixed as @xmath54 and @xmath57 when the bbn relation being adopted .",
    "it should be noted that these constraints are comparable to that obtained using cmb+lss in previous works .",
    "one of the main purposes of constraining the effective number of neutrino species using cosmological data is to check the standard value of @xmath0 independently from particle physics experiments .",
    "thus we primarily focus on the analysis with no prior on @xmath0 .",
    "however , from the viewpoint of constraining extra radiation which may be motivated from some particle physics models , a constraint obtained by assuming the prior @xmath58 may be interesting since an extra radiation always increases the value of @xmath0 . in this respect",
    ", we also made an analysis adopting this prior and obtained the constraint on the effective number of neutrino as @xmath59 and @xmath60 for the cases where the bbn relation is adopted and @xmath32 is treated as a free parameter .",
    "on the other hand , in a scenario with low - reheating temperature , the effective number of neutrino species can be reduced . in this case , another prior may be motivated to be assumed for a simple scenario of low - reheating temperature with three relativistic neutrino species . in this regard , we have also studied the case with the prior @xmath61 and obtained the constraints as @xmath62 for the cases with @xmath32 being assumed as a free parameter .",
    "this can be translated into the lower bound on the reheating temperature as @xmath63 mev .",
    "we have also discussed a future constraint on @xmath0 using the expected data from planck experiment .",
    "it was shown that the attainable constraint on @xmath0 from planck is @xmath64 at 95% c.l . when the bbn relation is adopted for @xmath32 , which is most stringent compared to the other cases . since planck experiment can probe cmb down to smaller scales than wmap",
    ", planck alone can give a stringent constraint on @xmath0 .",
    "the interplay between particle physics and cosmology is now becoming more important in the era of precision cosmology .",
    "one of such examples is the number of neutrino species , which was investigated in this paper . in light of upcoming more precise observations of cosmology , research of this kind",
    "will bring us fruitful insight for particle physics and cosmology .    *",
