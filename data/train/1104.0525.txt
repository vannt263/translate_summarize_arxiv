    "in 1963 , @xcite suggested the existence of an ionized layer about the galactic plane , to explain the radio frequency spectrum observed in directions towards the galactic pole . assuming an electron temperature of @xmath3  k , they estimated the electron density to be @xmath4 0.1  @xmath5  and the total mass of ionized gas to be @xmath6  m@xmath7 . the discovery of pulsars @xcite and the use of their dispersion measure to estimate the mean electron density along the path indicated the existence of extended zones of ionized gas in the galaxy .",
    "the detection of faint optical line emission outside the classical galactic h  ii  regions @xcite clearly established the existence of a widespread diffuse ionized medium in the galaxy .",
    "however , it was only after the discovery of pulsars in globular clusters located far from the galactic plane that the scale height of this warm ionized medium ( wim ) started being really appreciated : @xcite showed that the ionized gas extends as far as 4  kpc from the galactic plane and estimated a free - electron scale height of about 1.5  kpc .",
    "the detection of extra - planar ionized gas in edge - on spiral galaxies using deep h@xmath1  imaging enabled a better description of the vertical distribution of this extraplanar diffuse ionized gas ( edig ) which permeates the thick disks and haloes of the galaxies .",
    "the dig turns out to be a major component of the interstellar medium in galaxies @xcite and investigating its topology , composition , ionization conditions and relation to the other phases of the interstellar medium  cold neutral medium ( cnm ) , warm neutral medium ( wnm ) and hot ionized medium ( him )  is needed for a complete understanding of the evolution of the interstellar medium in galaxies and its impact in the intergalactic medium .",
    "most specialists agree that massive ob stars in galaxies likely represent the main source of ionizing photons for the edig ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein )",
    ". however , the fact that the edig is detected well above the thin disks of galaxies implies some porosity of the interstellar medium , so that part of the ionizing photons emitted by the ob stars , whose scale height is @xmath4 100 pc or less , arrive unabsorbed at heights of the order of a kiloparsec or more @xcite .",
    "alternatively , an additional source of ionization could contribute at such latitudes .",
    "the existence of an additional ionizing source is suggested by the reported increase of such emission line ratios as [ n  ii]/h@xmath1 , [ s  ii]/h@xmath1 , and [ o  iii]/h@xmath0with galactic height , which can not be reproduced with models of photoionization by hot , massive stars , even taking into account the hardening of the ionizing radiation due to intervening absorption ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the sources of additional ionization / heating that are most commonly invoked are shocks @xcite , turbulent mixing layers @xcite , magnetic reconnection , cosmic rays , or photoelectric emission from small grains @xcite .",
    "note that the need of additional heating sources has also be discussed in another context , that of ionized gas in the disks of spiral galaxies beyond the h  idisk @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , the role of hot low - mass evolved stars ( from now on referred to as holmes ) , which are plentiful in the thick disks and lower haloes of galaxies , and have been recognized long ago to be a significant source of uv photons in galaxies were reconsidered for the edig only by @xcite but seem to have been disregarded since then .",
    "however , it has been convincingly shown that the populations of the holmes expected to be found in galaxies can explain the observed line intensities in early - type galaxies .",
    "these stars produce a much harder radiation field than massive ob stars , and are therefore able to heat the edig to higher electron temperatures .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show that the expected populations of holmes , when combined to the population of massive ob stars , are perfectly able to reproduce the distribution of emission line ratios in the edig .",
    "we chose to focus on one object : the edge - on spiral galaxy ngc 891 , a galaxy located at a distance of 10 mpc , with overall properties similar to those of the milky way , that has been extensively observed , especially in optical emission lines , providing the most demanding diagnostics for our scenario .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : obs ] presents the observational data to be explained .",
    "section  [ sec : scen ] describes the scenario we explore .",
    "section [ sec : mod ] explains how we computed the flux and spectral energy distribution of the radiation from the massive ob stars and from the holmes and describes our grid of photoionization models using combinations of those as an input .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] presents the confrontation of our models with the observational data .",
    "finally section  [ sec : conclusions ] summarizes our results and presents prospects for future work .",
    "the appendix discusses several effects not taken into account in our principal grid of models , showing that they do not alter our main conclusion , i.e. that the expected population of holmes can explain the emission lines observed in the edig .",
    "quite a number of spectroscopic observations of the extraplanar gas in ngc 891 have been accumulated over the years as compiled by @xcite for the digeda data base .",
    "the most interesting data set from our point of view is the one by @xcite , in which the intensities of h@xmath1 , h@xmath0 , [ n  ii ] , [ o  ii ] , [ o  iii ] , and [ s  ii ] , [ o  i ] , [ o  ii ] , [ o  iii ] , and [ s  ii ]  stand for [ n  ii ] @xmath86584 , [ o  i ] @xmath86300 , [ o  ii ] @xmath83726 + @xmath83729 , [ o  iii ] @xmath85007 , and [ s  ii ] @xmath86716 , respectively . ] were measured along a slit placed perpendicularly to the plane of the galaxy .",
    "the availability of the h@xmath0  line allowed the authors to correct the observed line ratios for reddening , assuming an intrinsic value of h@xmath1/h@xmath0 of 2.9 .",
    "care was taken by the authors to account for stellar absorption in the h@xmath0  line as well as possible .",
    "the most important advantage of the data set by @xcite with respect to previous data sets is that it contains the [ o  ii ]  line , which provides an important diagnostic of the ionization conditions in the edig , when complemented with the [ o  iii ]  and hydrogen lines . in absence of [ o  ii ]",
    "one is forced to rely on either [ n  ii ]  or [ s  ii ]  to estimate the excitation level of the gas .",
    "however the use of [ n  ii ]  implies making an assumption on n / o , while nothing is a priori known on this abundance ratio within the edig .",
    "regarding [ s  ii ] , while the s / o ratio can be expected to be identical to the one in the sun or in classical h  ii  regions , the use of this low excitation line in conjunction with [ o  iii ]  may lead to spurious interpretations : this line is emitted in a zone of very low excitation and it is known that , even in classical h  ii  regions , photoionization models in which the gas distribution is homogeneous fail to simultaneously reproduce the intensities of [ o  iii ] , [ o  ii ] , [ n  ii ] , [ s  ii ]  with respect to the hydrogen lines ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the figures of @xcite were digitized and the line ratios converted to the ones we show in figure [ fig : obser ] , which will be directly compared to our models .",

    "note that these error bars reflect only the errors of the flux measurements . in the original figure of @xcite",
    ", there are several spikes in [ o  ii ]  in the region of the plane of the galaxy .",
    "the authors warn that it is not clear how physical those peaks are .",
    "we have therefore removed the corresponding points in our figure . as has been noted by several authors , the [ o  iii]/h@xmath0ratio increases steadily with @xmath12 .",
    "the [ o  ii]/h@xmath0ratio also shows this tendency , although less strongly .",
    "the [ n  ii]/[o  ii ]  shows a shape in `` m '' , strongly suggesting that the n / o ratio is not constant .",
    "ignoring this fact when interpreting the data in terms of the ionization state of the dig would then lead to spurious results .",
    "note that part of the light from h  iiregions in the disk could be dust - scattered outside the disk and contribute to the extra planar emission .",
    "since the albedo is almost independent of wavelength in the optical the line ratios of the scattered component should be similar to the ones near the galactic plane .",
    "the fact that the extra planar emission has different line ratios implies that the scattered component is not dominant .",
    "@xcite also observed the faint [ o  i ] line ( with a slit not exactly at the same position as that of @xcite ) and plotted it as a function of @xmath2 . since the [ o  i ]  line has a similar problem as [ s  ii ] when attempting to interpret observations with the help of homogeneous photoionization models , we will not use this observation to constrain our models .",
    "however , once our fitting procedure is achieved , we will compare our predictions with those observations ( see sect [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "the same will be done with the he  i @xmath85876 line , extracted from fig .",
    "3 of @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite reported mid infra - red spectroscopy of the diffuse ionized halo in ngc 891 , which showed that the [ ne  iii ] @xmath815.6@xmath13m/[ne  ii ] @xmath812.8@xmath13 m is enhanced in the extraplanar pointings relative to the disk pointing .",
    "we will also confront our models to these observations ( see sect [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "finally , observations of the vertical distribution of the h@xmath1  surface brightness given by @xcite and @xcite provide important information on the number of ionizing photons absorbed as a function of height above the galactic plane .",
    "we first present a qualitative view of the scenario that we propose to explain the emission line features of the dig .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scenario ] , where the galactic plane is located at the bottom of the figure .",
    "the extraplanar gas is distributed in clouds , between which ionizing photons emitted by the massive stars located in the disk of the galaxy can travel up to high latitudes . for simplicity , we represent the gas clouds by rectangles .",
    "ionized gas is represented in blue while neutral gas is represented in red",
    ". for both components , a darker shade indicates higher density gas .",
    "all that is white represents very diffuse , coronal gas which is neither emitting in the optical nor absorbing .",
    "the big blue stars in the plot represent massive ob stars .",
    "they are located close to the galactic plane , and surrounded by h  ii  regions , some of which are density - bounded and allow leakage of ionizing photons .",
    "the small purple stars represent the holmes , which can be either central stars of present - day planetary nebulae , or hot pre - white dwarfs whose evolution time - scale is larger than that of the nebular envelope they ejected in a previous stage .",
    "these stars are much hotter than massive ob stars .",
    "they are also much more numerous and their height - scale is that of the old stellar population in the galaxy .",
    "most planetary nebulae , although surrounded by a gaseous envelope of density @xmath14  @xmath5  are density - bounded and allow leakage of hard ionizing photons in the diffuse medium ; some of them , however , are ionization - bounded . in both cases , the ionizing photons produced by the central stars are ultimately absorbed by gas  be it the proper planetary nebula or the diffuse interstellar gas  and , at the spatial resolution of the observations , they can be counted as photons available to ionize the edig .",
    "more importantly , most of the holmes are not surrounded by a planetary nebula , and the total number of ionizing photons they produce is thus far greater than what can be estimated from planetary nebulae alone .",
    "the part of the radiation from the massive stars embedded in the classical h  iiregions escapes and , in a first approximation , ionizes the `` bottom '' parts of the gas clouds . as @xmath2 increases",
    ", the surface fraction of the gas clouds that are not shielded by intervening neutral zones becomes smaller . at the same time , the radiation originating from the massive stars becomes harder , since it is the photons with energies closest to the ionization threshold of hydrogen which are absorbed first .",
    "the holmes , which are distributed in the galaxy thick disk and halo , also contribute to the ionization of the clouds .",
    "their influence with respect to that of ob stars increases away from the galactic plane , and the `` bottom '' of the clouds is ionized by a radiation field that becomes harder and harder . at any latitude",
    ", holmes will also produce an ionized skin on all the sides of the gaseous clouds that are not facing the ob stars .",
    "the clouds have to be optically thick , i.e. to possess a neutral core , since the [ o  i ]  line is detected at all heights above the galactic plane .    in the photoionization models presented below we consider , for simplicity ,",
    "that each cloud is ionized only from the `` bottom '' , by the summed radiation field from the ob stars and from the holmes , where we show that the main conclusions are indeed not affected . ] .",
    "the models are computed in the plane parallel approximation , assuming that each cloud is of constant density .",
    "the computations are stopped when the ionization fraction of hydrogen drops below 0.1% .",
    "[ fig : geometry ] shows the details of the ionization structure of a given cloud .    note",
    "that the covering factor of the whole population of clouds is not necessarily unity , and some ionizing radiation may escape from the galaxy .",
    "in this section , we first explain how we compute the ionizing radiation field that reaches the clouds , then we describe the grid of photoionization models constructed to interpret the observations .      the ionizing flux issuing from ob stars is obtained from the evolutionary stellar population synthesis code starburst99 @xcite .",

    "the metallicity of the stellar population is taken to be solar .",
    "we considered a continuous star formation and took the radiation field at an age when it is stabilized ( in practice @xmath15yr ) .",
    "we do not consider dilution of the ob radiation field , since the latitudes we consider ( up to 4kpc ) are much smaller that the radius of the stellar disk in ngc 891 , which is of @xmath421kpc .",
    "we estimate the total number of hydrogen ionizing photons , @xmath16@xmath17 , in the following way .",
    "the total infrared luminosity of ngc 891 is @xmath18  l@xmath7@xcite . using their eq .",
    "9 we obtain a total present - day star formation rate of 5.2  m@xmath7  yr@xmath19 in ngc 891 ( this assumes that the observed fir emission originates primarily from dust heated by o , b , and a stars ) .",
    "the total number of hydrogen ionizing photons for a constant stellar mass formation rate of 1  m@xmath7  yr@xmath19 given by starburst99 with the parameters listed above is @xmath20 ph s@xmath19 . thus the total number of hydrogen ionizing photons in ngc 891 is @xmath16@xmath17 @xmath21 ph  s@xmath19 .",
    "the vast majority of these ionizing photons is expected to be produced by ob stars located in the disk .",

    "further reduce the number of photons from ob stars reaching the cloud under consideration .",
    "the range of values of @xmath22  explored in the models below takes into account the , a priori ill - defined , covering factor .",
    "an additional factor to take into account is the _ partial _ absorption ( and hardening ) of the ob photons travelling in the edig before reaching the cloud .",
    "this is treated in appendix [ sec : effect - tau ] .      while starburst99 is optimized to provide a good description of the ionizing radiation field from massive stars , in particular through its use of modern model atmospheres for ob stars",
    ", it does not compute the radiation field from post - asymptotic giant branch stars .",
    "we therefore resort to use the evolutionary spectral synthesis code pegase with which we are able to compute the ionizing spectral energy distribution of holmes . taking again a kroupa stellar initial mass function and a solar metallicity",
    ", we consider the spectral energy distribution of a coeval population of stars at an age of 10 gyr , i.e. approximately the age of old stellar populations .",
    "the real star formation history of the old stellar populations in the halo and thick disk of ngc 891 is probably more complicated than that of the assumed instantaneous starburst .",
    "however the _ integrated _ radiation field from all the holmes in an old stellar population does not depend strongly on the details of the star formation history , as soon as ages larger than @xmath27yr are concerned .",
    "roughly , the stellar energy distribution is equivalent to that of a @xmath28  k blackbody ( thus much harder than the radiation field from massive stars ) , while the luminosity remains almost constant , as can be seen in fig . 2 of @xcite .",
    "for the scenario we adopted , the total number of ionizing photons of the holmes ( obtained by integrating the spectral energy distribution from pegase ) is @xmath29ph  s@xmath19  m@xmath7@xmath19 . if we consider that the mass of the old thick disk in ngc 891 is @xmath30  m@xmath7 as inferred from @xcite , the total ionizing photon number of the holmes present in the old thick disk is @xmath16@xmath31 = @xmath32ph  s@xmath19 .",

    "the real number of holmes is probably significantly larger , since many of them are expected to be less luminous than a `` typical '' planetary nebulae nucleus . ]",
    "considering the stars located in only half of the halo , the predicted mean surface flux of the ionizing photons from the holmes is @xmath34= @xmath35 ph  s@xmath19  @xmath25 , since the scale length of the thick disk is very close too that of the thin disk @xcite . for simplicity , we disregard the holmes that are present in the extended halo , so that , from this point of view , the value of @xmath34that we consider is a lower limit . as for ob stars , we do not consider dilution of the radiation field .",
    "in addition , we assume that the radiation field from holmes is the same whatever the distance from the galactic plane , in particular we do not consider any metallicity dependence . as a matter of fact , a metallicity of one tenth of solar , rather than solar , could perhaps be more representative of the metallicity of the thick disk and halo stellar populations in ngc 891 @xcite , but the ionizing radiation field from the holmes is virtually independent of metallicity , as shown in fig . 2 of @xcite .",
    "we also assume that the holmes radiation field is not modified by intervening absorption .",
    "this is a simplifying hypothesis which is justified by the fact that holmes are present everywhere in the edig .",
    "we are aware that there is much uncertainty involved in the predictions of stellar population synthesis models after the asymptotic giant phase ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , we believe that our procedure should roughly give the correct energy distribution and ionizing luminosity from the integrated population of holmes",

    "the he  i @xmath85876/h@xmath0ratio is reasonably well reproduced , given the uncertainty in the intensity of the weak he  i @xmath85876line .",
    "the [ s  ii]/h@xmath1and [ o  i]/h@xmath1ratios in the models does not reproduce the observed trends very well especially in the regions of small @xmath12 .",
    "however , as mentioned above , we can not expect our constant - density models to reproduce the entire range of excitations .",
    "in addition , the [ o  i]line can be produced in photodissociation regions in the presence of a large proportion of very small grains which , as shown by , can boost the gas temperature due to photoelectric heating and therefore allow the excitation of the [ o  i ]  line even in a neutral medium .",
    "such a scenario was not included in the present photoionization models . regarding [ ne  iii ]",
    "@xmath815.6@xmath13m/[ne  ii ] @xmath812.8@xmath13 m , our models overpredict this ratio .",
    "it must be recalled that to produce ne@xmath46  requires photons with energies of at least 3ryd , i.e. much higher than needed to produce o@xmath46 .",
    "photoionization model predictions of the ionization structure of neon strongly rely on the number of stellar photons just above 3ryd . for massive ob stars , state of the art stellar atmosphere models differ significantly in this energy range . for holmes , in addition ,",
    "the predicted spectral energy distributions in this energy range strongly depend on the adopted abundances for the heavy elements , particularly of carbon .",
    "therefore , we do not consider that the discrepancy between our models and observations as regards [ ne  iii ] @xmath815.6@xmath13m/[ne  ii ] @xmath812.8@xmath13 m disproves our models for interpreting the ionization of the edig .",
    "there has been no agreement so far on the nature of the ionization sources that could explain the behaviour of the emission lines observed in the diffuse ionized gas ( dig ) in late - type galaxies .",
    "several scenarios have been proposed in the past , none of them being fully satisfactory . in this paper",
    "we have analyzed the galaxy ngc 891 , the prototype and most studied of edge - on spiral galaxies , and we proposed a model that reproduces all the considered constraints satisfactorily .",
    "the most important challenge for the models considered so far was the observed increase of [ o  iii]/h@xmath0 , [ o  ii]/h@xmath0 , and [ n  ii]/h@xmath1  with increasing distance from the galactic plane .",
    "our model considers both the population of massive ob stars and that of hot low - mass evolved stars ( holmes ) expected to be present in the galaxy .",
    "the ionizing photons from the massive stars located in the galactic plane partly escape into the thick disk and halo , where they are gradually absorbed by the clouds that constitute the diffuse medium .",
    "the surface fraction of the gas clouds that are not shielded by intervening clouds becomes smaller with increasing distance to the galactic plane . at large distances from the galactic plane , holmes",
    "become dominant in terms of ionizing photons flux .",
    "since their integrated radiation field is much harder than that of ob stars , the heating of the edig becomes more efficient .",
    "we have constructed a finely meshed grid of photoionization models in the framework of this scenario and , for each value of the distance @xmath2 to the galactic plane , we have selected the ones that fit the observed values of the [ o  iii]/h@xmath0 , [ o  ii]/h@xmath0 , and [ n  ii]/h@xmath1  ratios",
    ". since we have no a priori knowledge of the chemical composition of the edig , we had to leave o / h and n / o as free parameters .",
    "we found that solutions exist for each value of @xmath2 .",
    "as a matter of fact , the problem is not fully determined , since solutions can be obtained for almost any value of o / h .",
    "the models clearly indicate a systematic decrease of the electron density with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "if we restrict to solar metallicity , we find that the models which fit the observations become dominated by the holmes as @xmath2 increases . turning the argument around",
    ", this might be an indication that the metallicity of the edig is roughly solar .",
    "our models also indicate that n / o increases with increasing distance to the galactic plane , at least until @xmath12@xmath4 1.5 kpc .",
    "this result is in agreement with what common sense would predict about the enrichment of the edig by holmes progenitors .    in summary",
    ", we have provided a quantitative model to explain the behaviour of the emission lines in the edig of ngc 891 using what is known of the populations of massive stars and holmes in this galaxy .",
    "this galaxy was chosen because it is the one with the largest set of observational data , allowing us to constrain the model relatively well . however , the model being at the same time quite natural and robust , it is likely that it can be applied to the edig of other galaxies as well .",
    "obvious next steps of this investigation would be to obtain deep 3d - spectroscopy of extraplanar gas with integral field units , in order to constitute a complete and reliable data set over the entire region of interest .",
    "this will allow us to map the characteristics of the stellar population using a stellar population synthesis code such as starlight ( see * ? ? ? * ) , and estimate directly the ionizing radiation fields from the holmes population , in a way similar to what was done in @xcite .",
    "this radiation field will then be fed into a 3d photoionization code , such as mocassin @xcite which can account for the spatial distribution of the ionizing sources . by confronting the computed emission line ratios with those observed across the field of ngc 891 ,",
    "this should allow us to test in much more detail the scenario proposed here .",
