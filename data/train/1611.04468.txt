    "since the identification of supermassive black holes ( bhs ) at the center of galaxies , their typical mass ( @xmath4 ) values have been measured in the @xmath9 range ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the more recent discovery of @xmath1010@xmath11 bhs @xcite in quiescent galaxies further extended the massive limit , pushing the previous @xmath1010@xmath12 boundary to heavier regimes .",
    "these extremely massive black holes ( @xmath1310@xmath14 , hereafter embhs ) give constraints to how massive a bh can grow through accretion within the inner galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . also , the embhs are thought to reside in @xmath1010@xmath15 giant elliptical host galaxies lying on the present day @xmath4@xmath16 relation ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , though we note there are exceptions to the expectation that bh growth closely follows that of the host ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    direct evidence for the existence of 10@xmath11 bhs was initially reported in a handful of nearby quiescent galaxies ( e.g. , ngc 3842 and ngc 4889 , @xcite ; ngc 1277 , @xcite ) , albeit with the validity of some of the measurements being questioned @xcite .",
    "even if we consider that the measured values are acceptable , the embhs tend to lie above the @xmath4@xmath16 , or more frequently , the @xmath4@xmath17 relations extrapolated from lower mass bhs ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , by up to an order of magnitude ( see also , @xcite on measurement issues for @xmath17 ) .",
    "to explain the high mass of embhs with respect to their host galaxies , @xcite suggest that embhs are formed through frequent dry mergers .",
    "however , this does not solve the problem entirely because such mergers might not necessarily induce strong active galactic nucleus ( agn ) activity in embhs found up to at least @xmath18 ( e.g. , @xcite , hereafter j15 ; @xcite ) .",
    "these observational and theoretical considerations lead to the natural question if the estimates of @xmath19 in agns are reliable .",
    "the @xmath4 estimators applied to high redshift quasar spectra have mainly relied on uv - based spectral features that are secondarily calibrated to hydrogen balmer line based estimators .",
    "one possibility is that the uv - based @xmath4 values are overestimated somehow .",
    "independent @xmath4 estimates from balmer - line based estimators would enhance the reliability of 10@xmath11 bhs in distant quasars .",
    "unfortunately , direct comparison between the uv - based versus balmer - based @xmath4 estimates has been scarce for embhs .",
    "previous studies have been largely limited to @xmath2010@xmath14 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and such studies are controversial regarding the scatter between and balmer - based estimators while consistent on the agreement betwen and balmer - based @xmath4 values . the most extensive study in this respect",
    "was done by shen et al .",
    "( 2012 , hereafter s12 ) where the sample includes dozens of embhs , though with few bhs above 10@xmath11 .    in order to understand the mass growth of embhs , accurate @xmath4 measurements over a range of redshifts is vital . in the distant universe , however , direct dynamical measurement of @xmath4 becomes difficult for quiescent galaxies , as it is hard to resolve the gravitational sphere of influence from the bh .",
    "instead , broad line gas kinematics are used to estimate the @xmath4 of agns , where this method gives more uncertain results .",
    "@xmath4 measurements for agns are based on the reverberation mapping technique ( @xcite ; @xcite ) which measures the time delay of the broad line emission to the incident continuum and thus estimates the size of the broad line region ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the @xmath21 values for h@xmath22 are further calibrated by the radius ",
    "luminosity relationship ( @xmath23@xmath24 relation , @xcite ; @xcite ) , which allows the estimation of @xmath4 from a single - epoch measurement of optical continuum / line luminosity and broad line width .",
    "high redshift agns have their rest - frame optical ( rest - optical ) emission redshifted to the infrared , and their rest - frame ultraviolet ( rest - uv ) emission redshifted into the optical .",
    "the single - epoch mass estimators are thus secondarily calibrated in the uv assuming that the uv continuum luminosity and broad emission line ( or ) widths follow the optical @xmath23@xmath24 relation and optical line widths respectively , as a linear or power - law relation .",
    "ongoing studies tentatively find that the slope of the @xmath23@xmath24 relation follows that of the optical relation , and extends up to the most luminous quasars ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . however , the uv continuum luminosities and line widths are not tightly correlated with the optical quantities , introducing an intrinsic scatter of @xmath100.4dex when comparing and balmer @xmath4 measurements ( e.g. , j15 ) .",
    "in addition to the issues regarding the reliability of the rest - uv @xmath4 measurements , the rest - optical @xmath4 measurement from single - epoch spectroscopy itself has limitations on its accuracy due to the systematic uncertainties in deriving the mass equation .",
    "bearing in mind that the single - epoch @xmath4 values have sizable errors from the poorly constrained constant ( virial factor , hereafter @xmath25factor ) in the mass equation ( 0.30.4dex systematic uncertainty , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) and the @xmath23@xmath24 relation ( 0.10.2dex intrinsic scatter , @xcite ) , it is possible that the @xmath4 values of the most extreme agns could have been biased to high values if they were selected to have outlying @xmath25-factors or @xmath21 values with respect to the calibrations . indeed ,",
    "theoretical and technical issues that could positively bias the @xmath4 measurements have been reported , from accretion disk modeling ( @xcite ; @xcite ) or profile fit methodology ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , potential limitations of automated spectral fitting of a large sample of spectra failing to model unusual spectral features ( e.g. , @xcite ) or using single - epoch spectroscopy to derive representative agn properties should be carefully checked , especially at extreme mass values .    in this paper , we present rest - optical spectra of 26 quasars at 0.7@xmath26@xmath27@xmath262.5 with uv - based @xmath1010@xmath11 @xmath4 measurements , obtained with the nasa infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) .",
    "we aim to double check the consistency of the massive end uv - optical @xmath4 estimates , and examine if the measurements could be systematically biased to unusually high masses from spectral features and during application of the mass estimator .",
    "we describe the sample selection and data acquisition of extremely massive agns ( section 2 ) , the spectral analysis in determining @xmath4 ( section 3 ) , the results ( section 4 ) and implications on the measured @xmath4 values ( section 5 ) . throughout",
    ", we adopt a flat @xmath28cdm cosmology with @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we selected the extremely massive agn sample from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) type-1 quasar catalog ( dr7 , @xcite ) . the spectral fitting results and the @xmath4 estimates in @xcite",
    "were adopted for target selection , using the h@xmath22 line at @xmath32 , at @xmath33 , and at @xmath34 .",
    "we identified the sample by applying the following selection criteria : +    * mass selection of @xmath35 * redshift cut of @xmath0 to place the broad h@xmath3 and h@xmath22 lines within the near - infrared ( nir ) spectroscopic windows , excluding redshifts where both h@xmath3 and h@xmath22 are close to nir telluric absorption ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) * continuum signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) cut of 20 or higher from the sdss spectra for good line width and flux measurements , @xmath38-band magnitude @xmath2617.8 ab mag , bright enough for irtf observations * removal of objects flagged or visually inspected to show double - peaked h@xmath22 lines , severely absorbed or , and obvious mismatch between the model and the spectrum    yielding 1254 quasars sufficing the @xmath4 and redshift cut , and 261 objects with further sensitivity limits and flags , among which we arbitrarily selected 26 objects spanning the optical continuum luminosities . ] of @xmath39 , for irtf observations .",

    "those within our redshift and sensitivity cuts , flagged or visually inspected for spurious line profiles or fitting , are displayed ( black circles ) , among which we picked 26 for irtf follow - up spectroscopy ( red stars ) . ]",
    "we used the spex instrument @xcite on irtf to obtain the nir spectra of the targets .",
    "the 0.82.4@xmath40 m cross - dispersed mode ( sxd ) was chosen , with the slit width of 0.8@xmath41 or 1.6@xmath41 depending on the seeing conditions .",
    "this yields a spectral resolution of @xmath42 or 375 throughout the observed wavelengths , which is tuned for sensitivity over resolution for the broad agn emission lines and continuum features .",
    "the exposure times for the targets were aimed to give a continuum s / n per resolution element of at least 10 around h@xmath22 , and 5 around h@xmath3 .",
    "we carefully checked each field to avoid neighbor source contamination when nodding the spectrum along the 15@xmath41 slit length .",
    "the observations were performed during three full and three half nights in 2011 december , 2012 february / december along with another program , summing to a total on - source integration of 9.7 hours for all the targets ( 0.10.6 hours per target ) .",
    "the weather conditions were overall photometric but atmospheric seeing varied from 0.62@xmath41 .",
    "we nodded the spectra in ab mode with a 90180s frame time for good dark and sky subtraction , and observed a0 v type standard stars nearby the target for telluric absorption correction @xcite and flux calibration .",
    "also , a set of flat - field and argon arc wavelength calibration data were taken .",
    "we summarize the irtf observations in table 1 .",
    "in addition to the nir spectroscopy , we compiled the optical spectra of quasars from the sdss database ( dr12 including both the sdss - i / sdss - ii and the sdss - iii boss data , @xcite ) in order to calculate the @xmath4 values from and lines and to compare them with masses from hydrogen balmer lines or previous rest - uv measurements . also , broad - band photometric data from galex gr7 , sdss dr12 , 2mass psc , and ukidss dr10 releases ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) were collected to supplement the spectra with monochromatic continuum luminosities .",
    "the latest spectra ( sdss - iii boss over sdss - i / sdss - ii ) and photometry ( ukidss over 2mass ) were used when the target had overlapping data , while multiple spectra from the same instrument were averaged .",

    "the h@xmath22 emission was fit by a single narrow ( full width at half maximum , or fwhm@xmath261000  hereafter and 800  for @xmath54 . ] ) gaussian and double broad ( fwhm=200015,000  hereafter ) gaussian components , double narrow gaussians for each [ ] @xmath554957 , 5007 doublet , and h@xmath56 by a single narrow and single broad gaussian . when some of the [ ] profiles were broader than their limit , the fwhm limit was relaxed to fwhm@xmath262000 . to obtain a better quality fit , we fixed the center of the narrow h@xmath22 as the same redshift as one of the double narrow [ ] @xmath554957 and one of the double narrow [ ] @xmath555007 , one of the double broad h@xmath22 , and also the broad and narrow h@xmath56 .",
    "in addition , the centers of each gaussian component were constrained to lie within 1000  of the h@xmath3 redshift .",

    "next , we fit the rest - frame 60007100  region including the h@xmath3 emission .",
    "we fixed the height and width of the complex from the h@xmath22 region ( or the region when s / n@xmath265 ) since they are weaker and harder to constrain around the h@xmath3 emission . a power - law continuum , single narrow gaussian and double broad gaussians for the h@xmath3 , single narrow gaussian for each [ ] @xmath556300 , 6364 , [ ] @xmath556548 , 6583 , and [ ] @xmath556716 , 6731 doublet , were simultaneously fitted to the subtracted spectrum .",

    "we notice that some objects show asymmetric double - peaked features on top of the smooth , broad h@xmath3 , exhibiting relatively wide line widths ( fwhm@xmath598000 ) when fitted altogether .",
    "they resemble the disk emitters explained by a rotating accretion disk source pronounced in a small fraction of h@xmath3 spectra , where the broad line luminosity or width using the full profile can overestimate the contribution from the blr ( e.g. , figure 1 in @xcite ; figure 4 in @xcite ) . in order to quantify which sources are likely disk emitters",

    "we define an emission line to be double - peaked when non - zero blue- and redshifted broad gaussian components make up more than half of the total broad h@xmath3 luminosity , the triple component model is favored over the single or double component fit with a statistically smaller reduced chi - square ( a f - distribution probability of over 0.99 ) , and the disk emitter components are clearly detached in order to distinguish from a simply wide and non - gaussian blr model .",
    "the criteria give seven classified double - peaked emitters    third , we fit the rest - frame 22003100  region surrounding the emission .",

    "therefore , we keep the j15 estimator as a relatively more reliable @xmath4 indicator for the rest of the paper .                we find seven out of 26 broad h@xmath3 profiles classified as double - peaked emitters in section 3 ( j02 , j05 , j06 , j08 , j14 , j18 ) , best fit as triple gaussians with clear blue- and redshifted components comparable in strength or dominating over the central broad component . in figure 6 , we plot the h@xmath3 fit and the noise spectrum of the double - peaked emitters , and find that the asymmetric , double - peaked features are stronger than the noise levels . from figure 4 , we find the double - peaked emitters are slightly above the j15 @xmath57@xmath82 relation by 0.068dex on average , though within @xmath83dex from the j15 relation . also , the double - peaked emitters lie below the @xmath84@xmath85 relation by @xmath86dex on average , slightly larger than @xmath87dex from the j15 relation .",

    "these [ ] line widths are too broad to be explained by even the most massive galaxy s gravitational potential ( @xmath123 ) , and are broad relative to quasars at comparable luminosity or redshift ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "previous work on broad [ ] emission in quasars shows that the width correlates with its blueshift , indicative of strong outflows ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore investigate the effect of fixing the width of narrow lines around the h@xmath3 for the objects with [ ] profiles broader than @xmath124 , bearing in mind they were fixed to 1000  in section 3 .",
    "we fit the h@xmath3 region by first fixing the narrow line fwhm to that of the [ ] assuming all the narrow lines are fully broadened as the [ ] , and to 400  ( the mean @xmath92 of local quasars used in section 3 ) assuming they are completely absent of outflows , respectively , where the @xmath84 of quasars with broad [ ] for example , seem to lie in between @xcite .",

    "we checked if our sample exhibits this constant relation between the h@xmath3 fwhm and @xmath5 values determined from section 3 .",
    "we find that the mean and rms scatter of the fwhm to @xmath5 ratios of the 21 objects without double - peaked emitters are mildly smaller than 2 ( @xmath151 ) and thus the embh masses are less likely to be spuriously overestimated by using fwhm instead of @xmath5 .",
    "in fact , when assuming that the @xmath152 scales proportional to @xmath153 and @xmath154 , the @xmath155 based @xmath88 values from equations 12 would change from the fwhm based by @xmath156@xmath157 ( 0.30 on average ) dex , nearly doubling the non - double - peaked , @xmath158 objects from 7 to 13 .",
    "interestingly , the fwhm to @xmath5 ratios for the double - peaked emitters are somewhat larger than the rest of the sample ( average and rms scatter of @xmath159 ) so that they will be better noticed by extremely wide fwhms rather than @xmath5 values .",

    "we begin by comparing the double - peaked emitter fraction to those from the literature with larger samples at @xmath160 .",
    "our double - peaked emitter fraction , 7/26 ( 27% ) , is comparable to or higher than 20% among 106 radio - loud agns @xcite , and much higher than 3% out of 3216 optically selected quasars @xcite .",
    "the double - peaked emitters show broader @xmath92 than typical agns , distributed mostly above 5000  and comparable in number to the non - double - peaked at above 8000  ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "we find that there is a mild increase of the double - peaked emitter fraction at higher @xmath57 with a fixed fwhm , but the fraction increases more significantly with fwhm at a fixed @xmath57 .",
    "this suggests that extremely wide fwhms are likely to be associated with double - peaked emitters , regardless of the @xmath4 .",
    "we note that some double - peaked emitters could be missed for a variety of reasons .",
    "for instance , the line - emitting accretion disk model ( e.g. , @xcite ) predicts that the double - peaks may not be detached at small inclination angles ( @xmath163 ) and look alike ordinary broad emission .",
    "this adds ambiguity of whether the observed broad lines in type-1 agns are coming from random motions of broad line clouds or keplerian rotation of a disk , and it may be separated by velocity resolved reverberation measurements of the line emitting region size ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "to summarize , we caution against blindly adopting @xmath4 estimates based on any line with @xmath1668000 . for example , searching for quasars in @xcite with s / n@xmath1310 and flagged not to be double - peaked emitters , there are 14 h@xmath3-based and 213 h@xmath22-based masses with @xmath167 at @xmath162 and @xmath168 , respectively . however",

    "we checked that the plotted objects are luminous enough to have an estimated host galaxy contamination of less than 20% at 5100  @xcite , or have hubble space telescope imaging so that the spatially resolved host galaxy contamination is below 20% at optical wavelengths .",
    "we do not find any correlation between the quantities , implying the line width does not suffer any more systematic biases than the balmer lines .",
    "instead , having checked that the irtf sources with blueshifted emission show broader than the balmer line widths ( section 4.2 ) , we plot in figure 11(b ) the to balmer broad line fwhm ratio against the balmer to broad line shift from compiled references and from this work . we find that the quantities are positively correlated , in accord with the trends between the and ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the linear fit to the data based on the fitexy and bces methods ( @xcite ; @xcite ) respectively yield @xmath169 this implies that to balmer fwhm ratios systematically increase with blueshift , for instance , by 0.310.35dex between 0 and 2000   blueshift .",
    "the blueshift of the line has been considered as one of the causes for the scatter in the broad line width ratios against or balmer lines . however , when we fit the data in figure 11(b ) and correct the @xmath85 values along the blueshift , it hardly reduces the @xmath70 value between the and balmer fwhms .",
    "even if we fix the slope of @xmath170 in equation ( 3 ) to obtain the minimum @xmath70 value between the fwhms , @xmath70 decreases from 0.153dex without a blueshift correction to 0.126dex , implying that the broad line outflows are only mildly responsible for the scatter between the and balmer @xmath4 values ( @xmath100.05dex considering the fwhm dependence on the @xmath4 estimation ) . among other mutually correlated observables ( eigenvector 1 , @xcite ) that scale with the broad line width ratios or the residuals of the ratios are the luminosity , equivalent width of the line , and shape parameters ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , reducing the intrinsic scatter between the and balmer based @xmath4 values from 0.430.51dex by merely 0.100.13dex .",
    "many eigenvector 1 properties are correlated with the eddington ratio , perhaps hinting that the line width bias could be driven by a physical mechanism such as strong outflowing winds at high eddington ratios , although the high eddington ratio is a necessary rather than sufficient condition for outflows @xcite .",
    "we further note that studies reporting the reduction of the @xmath70 value between the and balmer line based @xmath4 values by adding an obscuration correction term or adopting a shallower scaling of the @xmath85 term ( e.g. , @xcite ; s12 ) are not as effective when the dynamic range and sampling of the parameter space are improved ( e.g. , figure 11(a ) in this work , j15 ) .",
    "overall , the intrinsic scatter between to balmer line based @xmath4 values ( @xmath171dex , j15 ) is not yet fully explained by either empirical and physical approaches , leaving the possibility that the mass estimator is less reliable than balmer- or -based estimators due to more fundamental reasons , e.g. , non - virialized or non - reverberating velocity structure within the line region @xcite .",
    "we probe how the observed embh masses in agns constrain models for galaxy evolution in figure 12 , showing balmer @xmath4 values at the massive end as a function of redshift from compiled references and from this work .",
    "the most massive bhs seen in local inactive galaxies appear similarly massive to agns at @xmath172 and beyond . assuming that the embh hosting agns at @xmath173 will become inactive bulge galaxies falling on the local @xmath4@xmath174 relation , we draw in figure 12 the expected evolutionary tracks of the @xmath174 adopting the consensus of observed and simulated evolution of @xmath16 and effective radius ( @xmath175 ) for massive galaxies , i.e. , 2040% decrease in @xmath16 and 35 times increase in @xmath175 from @xmath176 to 0 , and the proportionality @xmath177 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the estimated @xmath174 values at @xmath178 are factors of few smaller than the most massive local galaxies , leaving the possibility for @xmath174 to grow after the black hole has reached embh mass .",
    "therefore , the observed embh masses in @xmath179 agns require them to be overmassive to their host bulges .    on the other side , we consider the effect of relaxing the assumption that the most massive bhs are hosted in the most massive early - type galaxies shaping the present day bh  galaxy scaling relations .",
    "first , the host galaxies of @xmath179 embhs may not end up being the most massive galaxies due to galaxy environment .",
    "if the embh hosts are not the central galaxies in moderately dense environments ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , they will not encounter minor mergers as frequently , which would imply more limited size growth . indeed , local examples of overmassive bhs are often in compact galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "second , it could be that the host galaxy evolves to be massive in stellar content , but not bulge - dominated in morphology .",
    "gas - rich major mergers that could trigger the observed agn luminosity traced by our sample ( e.g. , @xcite ) and form a bulge may still leave a disk , and transformation into the bulge through secular processes or repeated minor mergers could have somehow been prevented ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this scenario is consistent with most of the overmassive bhs on the @xmath4@xmath180 relation ( e.g. , @xcite ) being lenticular galaxies , with bulge to total mass ( or luminosity ) ratios typically ranging below unity ( 0.10.6 , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we have discussed that the relative growth modes for extremely massive bhs and their host galaxies can not only depend on the galaxy mass , but also environment or morphology .",
    "galaxy environment studies of embh hosts will help probe the contribution of mergers shaping the bh ",
    "galaxy scaling relations ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and spatially resolved imaging of the host will tell if a two parameter relation ( e.g. , @xmath4@xmath16 ) is sufficient to explain black hole - galaxy coevolution .",
    "luminous agn activity is rare in the present day universe and embhs have mostly been found in quiescent early - type galaxies .",
    "further discoveries of embhs ( e.g. , @xcite ) in lower bulge masses will constrain how tight the bh ",
    "galaxy scaling relations are at their massive end , and how often embhs in distant agns remain in the most massive galaxies at present .",
    "we performed followup rest - optical spectrocopy of a sample of 26 extremely massive quasars at @xmath0 in order to cross check their rest - uv @xmath4 values , and to examine possible biases affecting the measured @xmath4 values .",
    "we summarize the results as follows .",
    "the rest - uv @xmath4 estimates of @xmath18110@xmath128 in luminous agns , are generally consistent with the balmer based estimates . however , double - peaked emitters strongest in the h@xmath3 , extremely broad around , and highly blueshifted ( @xmath132000 ) profiles are frequently associated with @xmath18210@xmath128 estimates , easily boosting reported masses by a factor of a few .",
    "we find these cases mostly at broad line fwhm@xmath138000 , and make cautionary remarks for estimating @xmath4 values based on any line width over this limit .",
    "the presence of broadened ( fwhm@xmath131000 ) narrow emission ( e.g. , [ ] ) , however , does not appear to significantly bias embh mass measurements .",
    "we checked for systematic biases in single - epoch @xmath4 estimators for agns with embh masses and general agns .",
    "anisotropic radiation and the use of broad line fwhm in place of @xmath5 are not the major cause of producing false embh @xmath4 estimates for our sample .",
    "furthermore , variability , overestimated line equivalent width from cold accretion disks , and obscuration do not bias the @xmath4 estimates for general type-1 quasars by more than @xmath100.1dex .",
    "instead , correcting the @xmath4 estimator based on its blueshift relative to the balmer line redshift , the @xmath4 values decrease by 0.630.70dex from a zero to 2000  blueshift , with sizable scatter .",
    "+ 3 . removing the systematically uncertain @xmath4 values arising from the spectra or mass estimators",
    ", there is still a chance that embh masses are boosted by anisotropic motion of the broad line region from @xmath8 bhs , but this is contradictory to the current @xmath70 values of the local @xmath4@xmath16 relation for agns .",
    "the observed and simulated growth of @xmath180 in massive galaxies support that embh hosting agns at @xmath179 are growing dominantly by minor dry mergers , with their bhs overmassive to the host s bulge mass . depending on the galaxy environment in galactic and intergalactic scales",
    ", we expect that either the embh host will catch up the bh growth or the bh will stay overmassive to the bulge .",

    "<S> we obtained near - infrared spectra of 26 sdss quasars at @xmath0 with reported rest - frame ultraviolet @xmath1 to critically examine the systematic effects involved with their mass estimations . </S>",
    "<S> we find that agns heavier than @xmath2 often display double - peaked h@xmath3 emission , extremely broad complex emission around , and highly blueshifted and broadened emission . </S>",
    "<S> the weight of this evidence , combined with previous studies , cautions against the use of @xmath4 values based on any emission line with a width over 8000 . </S>",
    "<S> also , the @xmath4 estimations are not positively biased along the presence of ionized outflows , anisotropic radiation , or the use of line fwhm instead of @xmath5 for our sample , and unbiased with variability , scatter in broad line equivalent width , or obscuration for general type-1 quasars . removing the systematically uncertain @xmath4 values , @xmath6 bhs in @xmath7 agns can still be explained by anisotropic motion of the broad line region from @xmath8 bhs , although current observations support they are intrinsically most massive , and overmassive to the host s bulge mass . </S>"
