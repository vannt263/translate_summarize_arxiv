    "over the last decade  and  have significantly improved our knowledge of the  properties of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , especially at low redshifts , thanks to their broad - band coverage and relatively large effective areas above 2  kev . moreover ,",
    "the unique  coverage above @xmath1  10  kev ( up to ) provided by the phoswich detector system ( pds ) onboard  has allowed proper definition of intrinsic  continuum shapes of local seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; see also @xcite , this volume ) and quasars ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in section  2 we will briefly recall the most important  results obtained for a peculiar agn : the luminous , nearby radio - quiet quasar ( rqq ) pds  456 . although a few  spectral studies of quasars at @xmath2  23 have been carried out with  ( e.g. , @xcite ) and  ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the properties of luminous rqqs at higher redshifts ( @xmath0 ) were poorly known before the launches of the current generation of  telescopes ,  and . in section  3",
    "we will discuss the large improvements that have occurred in this field in the last few years .",
    "unfortunately , high - luminosity quasars are usually found at relatively high redshifts , thus appearing rather weak and difficult to study in x - rays before the launches of  and .",
    "-0.6 cm    in this context , pds  456 , at @xmath3 and with , can be considered an exceptional case , thus allowing an accurate modeling of the  continuum and reprocessing features with both  and  ( @xcite ) and , recently , with  ( @xcite ) .",
    "the  spectrum of pds  456 is characterized by a prominent ionized fe  k  edge [ clearly visible in the data - to - model residuals shown in fig .  1",
    ", panel ( a ) , when a single power - law fit is adopted ] ; the edge corresponds to fe  xxiv - xxvi at @xmath1  8.8  kev [ see fig .  1 ,",
    "panel ( b ) ] .",
    "the lack of iron emission lines suggests that the ionized edge is due to matter along the line - of - sight rather than reflection from a highly ionized accretion disk .",
    "indeed , the hard  continuum is due to transmission through a very ionized medium , best fitted by a column density , coupled with absorption by cold matter having ( @xcite ; see fig .  2 for the best - fit spectrum ) .",
    "the  properties of pds  456 appear quite different from those of the majority of the local palomar - green quasars ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; its photon index is rather flat ( @xmath4 ; see @xcite ) and the absorber ionization parameter @xmath5 , defined as the ratio of the ionizing photon density at the surface of the cloud to the electron density of the gas , is extremely high ( @xmath1  7900 ; see @xcite ) .",
    "this overall  picture for pds  456 has been confirmed recently by , whose spectral resolution has allowed three high - ionization iron  k edges ( @xcite ) to be distinguished instead of the one observed by   ( likely due to the different spectral resolution and effective area ) .",
    "has also discovered an extreme gas outflow velocity of @xmath1  50,000  km  s@xmath6 ( @xcite ) , thus supporting the idea that the ionized matter is close to the active nucleus of pds  456 .",
    "furthermore , the source showed repeated  flaring episodes , with an  flux doubling time of @xmath1  30  ks and a total energy output of the flaring events as high as 10@xmath7  erg @xcite .",
    "this extreme  variability and the presumably high accretion rate make this source more similar to the narrow - line seyfert  1 galaxies .",
    "high - resolution  spectroscopy of such objects can provide further details on the accretion mechanisms responsible for the  emission in high - luminosity objects ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the last few years evidenced an increasing interest in the study of @xmath8 agns ( mainly quasars ) , including in the  band . prior to 2000",
    "there were only six quasars at @xmath0 with  detections .",
    "the number of  detected quasars at @xmath0 doubled when the first systematic  study of these objects was carried out using archival  data ( @xcite ) .",
    "since then , the progress made in this field has been substantial .",
    "this has been possible due to the availability of increasing numbers of @xmath0 quasars from ground - based optical surveys ( e.g. , the sloan digital sky survey  sdss , @xcite , the digital palomar sky survey  pss , @xcite , and the automatic plate measuring facility survey  apm , @xcite),george / z4.qsos for a listing of high - redshift quasars . ] and the excellent capabilities of  and  for detecting faint sources .    to define the basic individual  properties ( i.e. ,  fluxes , luminosities , and optical - to-  spectral indices ) of @xmath0 quasars , we started a program to observe with  and  both the optically brightest pss / apm quasars and the higher redshift , optically fainter sdss quasars ( @xcite ; see also the recent review by @xcite ) . since the pioneering work with  ( @xcite ) , the number of agns with  detections has therefore increased significantly to more than 80 ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , . ] in the redshift range @xmath2  46.3 ( also see ) .        due to the extremely low background in typical  snapshot",
    "( @xmath1  410  ks ) observations , it has also been possible to derive average spectral constraints for subsamples of high - redshift quasars using joint spectral fitting with  counts ( @xcite ) . at @xmath0 , optically selected rqqs have a photon index of , similar to the results found at low and intermediate redshifts ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , no spectral evolution of the  continuum shape over cosmic time has been found ( see @xcite and fig .  4 ) . at high redshift , this result has been supported recently by direct  spectroscopy of qso  0000@xmath9263 at @xmath10 with  ( @xcite ) .",
