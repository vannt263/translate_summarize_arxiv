    "topological properties of condensed matter systems have been attracting attention already for several decades . beginning with the fractional fermions in the jackiw - rebbi and the su - schrieffer - heeger ( ssh ) models,@xcite shifting later to the quantum hall effect@xcite and topological insulators , @xcite and finally getting enriched by the bound states with non - abelian braiding statistics , majorana fermions@xcite and parafermions,@xcite the field continues its rapid development . not only pure scientific curiosity but also the promise of practical applications , such as conventional and topological quantum computing , provides strong motivation to explore this topic .",
    "the theoretical description of many spectacular experiments , such as , for example , the precise quantization of the hall conductance,@xcite relies on effective models .",
    "this is especially true in the case of two - dimensional systems with strong electron - electron interactions , such as fractional quantum hall effect and fractional topological insulators . at the same time , the quantum hall effect has been observed not only in the usual two - dimensional electron gases created in semiconductor heterostructures@xcite but also in quasi - two - dimensional materials such as graphene@xcite and organic compounds , for example , bechgaard salts .",
    "@xcite the main difference of the latter materials , which could be turned to a conceptual advantage , is their conduction anisotropy , such that the effective mass ( effective hopping matrix element ) in the @xmath0 direction is much larger ( smaller ) than in the perpendicular @xmath1 direction .",
    "hence , these materials can be treated as a strip of coupled stripes that allows one to treat tunneling between stripes as a small perturbation.@xcite this representation of two - dimensional electron gas as a system of coupled one - dimensional channels or wires turned out to be very fruitful for including electron - electron interactions and , in particular , for constructing a description of the fractional quantum hall effect in anisotropic systems.@xcite moreover , this method is not specific for quantum hall systems and can be generalized to other topological phases of two - dimensional systems .",
    "@xcite in particular , we implement these ideas to describe time - reversal invariant systems such as fractional topological insulators .    in the present work ,",
    "we propose two systems which exhibit both integer and fractional quantum spin hall effect , and , hopefully , can be realized in experiments using available ingredients . as a prototype of an effective one - dimensional channel ,",
    "we consider nanowires , quantum wires created by gating , atomistic chains , and cold atom systems . in our work , we refer to these channels as stripes .",
    "this choice is determined by the fact that our prime focus is on one - dimensional channels created by gating inside two - dimensional systems or occurring spontaneously as density modulations due to surface reconstruction again caused by electron - electron interactions .",
    "the first model consists of a strip of stripes with rashba spin orbit interaction ( soi ) , whose strength grows linearly from stripe to stripe .",
    "the direction of the corresponding soi vectors that determines the spin polarization axis is the same for all stripes .",
    "such gradient of soi can be created by a gradient in the electric field applied perpendicular to the strip .",
    "the main advantage of this simple model lies in the fact that its topological properties can be easily seen by making a straightforward connection to the quantum hall effect ( qhe ) . in this sense",
    ", it serves here as a warm - up before we introduce the second , much more complex and interesting model .",
    "indeed , such non - uniform soi is gauge - equivalent to the orbital effect produced by an effective magnetic field whose sign depends on the spin projection .",
    "the field is in the positive ( negative ) direction for spin up ( down ) states , so that we deal with two copies of quantum hall effect .",
    "this brings us back in the analogy with the quantum spin hall effect ( qshe ) in graphene described by kane and mele@xcite as two copies of the haldane model.@xcite also , an effective magnetic field allows us to introduce a concept of a filling factor @xmath2 for the qshe by analogy with the qhe .",
    "for example , at @xmath3 there is one pair of helical modes , modes which carry opposite spins in opposite directions . at the fractional filling factors such as @xmath4 , elementary excitations in these modes",
    "possess fractional charges and non - trivial commutation relations .",
    "we note that , similarly to the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) , the fractional quantum spin hall effect ( fqshe ) is present only if electron - electron interactions are strong enough to generate dominant back - scattering terms.@xcite    the second system , which is the main result of this work , is a bilayer composed of two strips that are coupled by tunneling .",
    "the soi inside a stripe is assumed to be uniform .",
    "this uniformity is an important key property that favours the bilayer model over the non - uniform one as it opens up a new class of effective models that captures the essential features of two - dimensional topological insulators currently observed in experiments .",
    "moreover , in contrast to the previous model , there is also soi associated with propagation in the direction perpendicular to the stripes , such that interstrip tunneling is not spin - conserving .",
    "we show that an interplay between inter- and intrastrip tunneling results in the qshe phase , if the intrastrip tunneling is dominant .",
    "again , in the regime of strong electron - electron interactions , the system could exhibit fqshe .",
    "we consider a strip of stripes that is aligned in the @xmath1 direction and consists of a number of stripes ( effective one - dimensional channels : also could be thought of as wires ) that are aligned in the @xmath0 direction,@xcite see fig .",
    "[ model ] .",
    "( we imagine a generic system where the stripes might be embedded in some host material that allows tunneling between the stripes and thus prefer the term stripe over the term wire ) .",
    "we also allow for tunneling between two neighboring stripes . however , to simplify our calculations , we assume that the hopping matrix element @xmath5 between two neighboring stripes is small in comparison to the fermi energy inside a stripe . as a consequence ,",
    "we first treat each stripe as completely isolated and only afterwards add the tunneling terms as a small perturbation .",
    "direction whereas the stripes stretch in the @xmath0 direction .",
    "tunneling of the strength @xmath5 couples neighbouring stripes .",
    "the stripes , which can be considered as density modulations , could be formed inside two - dimensional structures . ]",
    "the kinetic part of the hamiltonian corresponding to the @xmath6th stripe is written as @xmath7 where the annihilation operator @xmath8 removes an electron ( of charge @xmath9 and effective mass @xmath10 ) with spin @xmath11 at the point @xmath0 of the @xmath6th stripe . here , we choose the spin quantization axis along the @xmath12 direction defined by the spin orbit interaction that is also present inside the stripes ( see below ) .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath13 is uniform over the entire strip .",
    "the rashba spin orbit interaction ( soi ) term acts inside each of the stripes and is written as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the soi parameter that characterizes the soi strength inside the @xmath6th stripe .",
    "the pauli matrix @xmath16 acts on spin space . in what follows we consider a strip with a gradient of spin - orbit interaction in the @xmath1 direction @xmath17 such a gradient can be generated by a gradient in the electric field that induces the rashba soi .    the aforementioned tunneling between two neighboring stripes is described by @xmath18 where @xmath5 is a spin - conserving tunneling matrix element .",
    "it is important to note that the soi can be gauged away in strictly one - dimensional systems.@xcite for example , by applying a spin - dependent gauge transformation defined for each wire separately as @xmath19 to the stripe hamiltonian @xmath20 , we absorb the soi into the kinetic term , @xmath21 where , assuming charge neutrality , we ignore the constant shift in energy . here , @xmath22 is the soi wavevector of the stripe with index @xmath23 .",
    "however , the tunneling term , which connects two neighboring stripes and makes the system effectively two - dimensional , keeps the information about the initial soi .",
    "after the transformation , we arrive at @xmath24 where the tunneling matrix element @xmath5 acquires a phase and becomes spin- and position - dependent , i.e. @xmath25 .    above we started with a model containing the gradient of soi strength in the @xmath1 direction . however , as we have just seen , this model is equivalent to a model with a special form of the soi associated with the motion along the @xmath1 axis that results in a spin and position dependent phase @xmath26 in the tunneling matrix element .",
    "we also note that the latter model can be understood in terms of orbital effects caused by two opposite magnetic fields @xmath27 that act on states with spin @xmath11 . indeed , if the corresponding vector potential @xmath28 , @xmath29 , is chosen to be in the @xmath1 direction , @xmath30 , the phase acquired during the hopping from the @xmath6th stripe to the @xmath31th stripe is equal to @xmath32 . here , we have chosen the strength of the magnetic field to be @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the distance between stripes .",
    "all these agrees with the soi being treated as effective opposite orbital magnetic fields seen by electrons with opposite spins .",
    "consequently , we arrive at two uncoupled coexisiting 2degs of spin - up and spin - down electrons in the quantum hall regime similarly as it was done in the pioneering work of kane and mele @xcite based on the haldane model .",
    "@xcite thus , it is natural to expect that our simple model should also exhibit the quantum spin hall effect .",
    "we confirm this in the next two subsection and use this model as a conceptual warm - up before addressing more involved model introduced in the next section .",
    "we also note that such an analogy of soi with effective magnetic fields , allows us to introduce a concept of the filling factor @xmath2 , as a ratio of the total spin up ( spin down ) electron number to the degeneracy of the landau level in an effective magnetic field @xmath35 .",
    "we begin by assuming that the chemical potential is tuned to the crossing point between the spin - up and spin - down branches of the stripe with index @xmath23 , such that @xmath36 is equal to the soi energy , see fig .",

    "as we have already noted above , the bulk spectrum is fully gapped , @xmath69 where each energy level is twofold degenerate in spin .",
    "this degeneracy is nothing else but the kramers degeneracy of energy levels in a time - reversal invariant system .",
    "in addition , the hamiltonian @xmath70 is block - diagonal in spin space , so spin @xmath71 is a good quantum number , and eigenstates could be presented as spin - polarized .",

    "next , we impose vanishing boundary conditions on the wavefunctions at the left and right ends of each stripe .",
    "for example , wavefunctions should go to zero at the left end of each stripe @xmath74 : @xmath75 . using a standard scattering problem procedure of matching decaying eigenstate wavefunctions",
