    "systematic errors associated with chiral extrapolations present a serious obstacle to precise qcd calculations  @xcite .",
    "a rapid increase of the computational cost toward light quarks limits quark masses to the values larger than their physical ones , especially for dynamical wilson - type quarks .",
    "this limitation causes sizable ambiguities in the extrapolation to the physical point .    in this report",
    ", we analyze issues related to small quark masses and finite lattice spacings in the chiral extrapolation using several chiral extrapolation functions . our study is based on hadron mass data for small sea quark masses in the range @xmath4  @xcite , combined with our previous data at heavier quark masses at @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "these hadron mass data are generated with an rg - improved gauge action and a meanfield - improved clover quark action at @xmath1 ( @xmath6  fm ) .",
    "we use @xmath7 and @xmath8 lattices with the spatial size of 2.4 and 3.2  fm .",

    "the conventional polynomial extrapolation has a problem that polynomials are not consistent with the logarithmic singularity expected in the chiral limit .",
    "it is imperative to estimate the systematic errors due to higher order contributions when the data are extrapolated using a low - order polynomial .",
    "figure  [ figure : kappa_inv - m_ps2 ] shows that our new data at small sea quark masses deviate systematically from the quadratic fit of old data .",
    "the deviation is significant ; applying higher order polynomial extrapolations to the whole data , @xmath9 differs by @xmath10 , and the lattice spacing by @xmath11 .",
    "a choice for controlled chiral extrapolations is to incorporate chiral perturbation theory ( chpt).however , the present lattice data are not quite consistent with chpt in the continuum  @xcite , which predict the following quark mass dependence to one - loop order : @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are parameters to be obtained by fits . fitting the data over the whole range @xmath160.35 yields a large @xmath17 .",
    "we have to restrict the fitting interval to @xmath180.35 to obtain a reasonable fit with @xmath19 , as represented in fig .",

    "this may be an indication that the chiral logarithm is visible only at @xmath20 .",
    "another possibility that we do not clearly observe chiral logarithm in our data is the suppression by explicit chiral symmetry breaking of the wilson quark action ; modifications of chpt due to finite lattice spacings may be needed for analyses of data obtained on coarse lattices .",
    "recently studies were made to adapt chpt to the wilson - type fermion at finite lattice spacings ( wchpt )  @xcite .",
    "care has to be exercised in the order counting since formulae for observables are different .",
    "we employ the wchpt formulae which treat the @xmath3 effects at the leading order  @xcite , because the existence of parity - broken phase and vanishing of pion mass depend on them in a critical way .",
    "there are two features in these formulae worth emphasizing : ( i ) the coefficients of chiral logarithm terms receive @xmath21 contributions , modifying the chiral behavior at finite lattice spacings , ( ii ) terms of the form @xmath22 appear , which are more singular than the @xmath23 terms toward the chiral limit at a finite lattice spacing .",
    "the @xmath22 terms must be resummed . the resummed wchpt formulae ( rwchpt ) proposed by aoki  @xcite read , @xmath24 where the fit parameters are @xmath9 in @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath15 and @xmath31 . as we show in fig .",
    "[ figure : chiral_log_m_ps2_m_quark_awi_renormalized_f_ps_wchpt ] , the one - loop rwchpt formulae is capable of fitting our data over the whole range @xmath160.35 .",
    "the fit result shows that the leading and the one - loop contributions in rwchpt converges well and the parameter values are comparable with phenomenological estimates . it is also found that if we make a rwchpt extrapolation using our previous data at @xmath160.55 , the new data at @xmath180.35 lie well on the extrapolation curve .    encouraged by the features above of the wchpt fit , we reanalyzed the previous data at @xmath160.55 on finer lattices with @xmath32 and 0.11  fm ( @xmath33 ) using wchpt and performed the continuum extrapolation . for the quark mass in the continuum limit",
    ", we find @xmath34  [ mev ] , which is smaller than the previous result  @xcite based on the quadratic chiral extrapolation by approximately 10% .",
    "we have extended the study of the light hadron spectrum and the quark mass in two - flavor qcd@xcite to smaller sea quark masses corresponding to @xmath180.35 .",
    "the new data clearly show systematic deviations from the previous quadratic chiral extrapolation using the data in the range @xmath350.55 .",
    "whereas fits with either polynomial or continuum chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) fails , the wilson chpt ( wchpt ) that includes @xmath36 effects associated with explicit chiral symmetry breaking successfully fits the whole data .",
    "in particular , wchpt correctly predicts the light quark mass behavior from data at medium heavy quark masses such as @xmath37 .",
