    "assuming the maximum observed line of sight measurement and the 3@xmath15 lower limit on the x - ray measured n@xmath4 implies that the obscuration of the system is a minimum of 1.8 times that of the line of sight .",
    "this implies some level of absorption is intrinsic to the system .",
    "modelling the ir sed with an absorbed blackbody implies a range of extinctions of 9  @xmath26a@xmath32  @xmath2617.5 . from this equates to an n@xmath4 of ( 1.63.1 )  @xmath6  10@xmath7@xmath8 ; this is comparable to what is expected for the line of sight .",
    "however , due to the degeneracy between the model parameters of sed model , the lower values of n@xmath4 correspond are for cooler stars , which if they are on the main sequence , will be very close to us and consequently will effectively have no line of sight contribution ; the higher n@xmath4 values are slightly larger than the line of sight but would correspond to early type stars which would have a heavy stellar wind component which would increase their line of sight extinction .",
    "the ir sed can not explain the larger x - ray measured abosorbing column which would imply that any intrinsic obscuring material is concentrated around the compact object .",

    "while igr j16493@xmath04348 does not have an intrinsic absorption quite this high it does lie at the high end of the range of measured n@xmath4 for traditional hmxb systems .",
    "hmxb systems accreting via the stellar wind of a companion typically have luminosities of 10@xmath3410@xmath35 erg s@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "if the source is a hmxb then a likely location for the source would be within the norma arm tangent , as this arm is tangential to the line of sight and which would give a source luminosity of @xmath310@xmath35 erg  s@xmath10 .",
    "however , even if placed at 23 kpc away , on the far side of the galaxy , the source luminosity would not exceed @xmath36erg  s@xmath10 in the 1100 kev band .",
    "furthermore studies of the luminosities of x - ray binaries broken down by compact object type have indicated that neutron star systems predominantly have luminosities of @xmath3@xmath37erg  s@xmath10 whilst black hole systems predominantly have luminosities of @xmath3@xmath36erg  s@xmath10 .",
    "the range of reasonable luminosities for igr j16439@xmath04348 would therefore suggest it is more likely a neutron star system .",
    "timing analysis of the integral / ibis data also shows no indication of a coherent timing signal on timescales of the order of 101000 s or of days to months .",
    "the lack of any detected x - ray pulsations or any indication of orbital signature makes it difficult to say with any certainty that this is a high mass x - ray binary system .",
    "however , there is evidence in the light curves that the source varies both in the x - ray and @xmath1-ray bands .",
    "this is further suggested by the low cross - calibration constant required in fitting the swift - integral spectra .    despite the close proximity of the source to the plane of the galaxy ,",
    "the source lies only @xmath320@xmath11 away from the galactic centre and could conceivably be a low mass x - ray binary which is located towards the edge of the galactic bulge .",
    "typical absorbing columns for lmxb sources are n@xmath4  @xmath26  @xmath31@xmath8 .",
    "hence the identification of a column density higher than that associated with the galactic line of sight would make this a very unusual lmxb system .",
    "additionally , there is no indication in the 2.8 ms of ibis data of the source ever having undergone a type i x - ray burst which is characteristic of lmxb systems , however this is by no means conclusive .",
    "we conclude that igr j16493@xmath04348 is not associated with the free radio pulsar , psr j1649@xmath04349 due to the position offset of the high energy emission and that the source is vastly overluminous in the 1100 kev band to be powered purely by the spin - down of the pulsar .",
    "the spectrum of igr j16493@xmath04348 is best fit by an absorbed power law with a high energy cut - off .",
    "the spectral characteristics of the source are typical of an accreting neutron star .",
    "the bright ir magnitudes of the ir counterpart together with the absence of an optical counterpart is indicative of an obscured source and are modeled well by an absorbed blackbody .",
    "the location of the source in the region of the norma arm spiral tangent is a tentative indicator that this source is likely to be a neutron star hmxb .",
    "the proximity of the source , however , to the galactic bulge means that a low mass x - ray binary nature of this source can not be ruled out .    the true nature of this source will only be definitively confirmed through further observations and study .",
    "specifically , ir spectroscopic follow - up may identify the nature of the donor star and any detection of x - ray pulsations would confirm the nature of the compact object .",
