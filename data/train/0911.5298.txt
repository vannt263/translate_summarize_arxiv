    "the aim of this work is to describe low energy quadrupole collective excitations of the even - even isotopes within the frame of a microscopic theory based on the skyrme effective interaction .",
    "we present results of calculations for @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 excited levels and b(e2 ) probability for the @xmath9 transition in the whole chain of isotopes .",
    "moreover , we include more detailed data on levels and e2 transitions for the nucleus . to study the collective phenomena the standard mean field theory",
    "must be extended with the adiabatic time dependent hfb method , which is used in this paper , or the generator coordinate method .",
    "the important feature of the approach presented below is that the collective space contains all quadrupole degrees of freedom , i.e. both @xmath10 and @xmath11 deformations and the euler angles .",
    "this allows us to study in a consistent way an evolution of collective properties along the considered chain from spherical nuclei around the semi - magic to well deformed but soft against @xmath11 deformation heavier isotopes .",
    "this approach was applied previously with a reasonable success for several other regions of nuclei in.@xcite    we should add that various properties of the discussed mo isotopes ( of all or some of them ) were studied in numerous papers using various theoretical methods , let us mention only some of the most recent ones.@xcite",
    "the main tool of the collective part of the presented approach is the general bohr hamiltonian , which is determined by 7 functions depending on the deformation variables @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "the functions are : the potential energy and 6 inertial functions , including 3 moments of inertia ( the inertial functions are frequently called mass parameters ) .",
    "the microscopic part of our approach is based on the adiabatic time dependent hfb method which allows us to calculate the seven mentioned functions starting from the effective nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "the deformation variables @xmath10 , @xmath11 are defined through mean values ( in a hfb state ) of the components of the quadrupole tensor of mass distribution by @xmath12 , @xmath13 with @xmath14 .",
    "below we discuss the results obtained using two well known variants of the skyrme interaction : siii@xcite and sly4.@xcite for the p - p ( pairing ) channel we chose the constant @xmath15 ( also called state independent or of the seniority type ) interaction .",
    "the strength of the pairing interaction was determined by comparing ` experimental ' pairing gaps with calculated minimal quasi - particle energies for isotopes . by ` experimental ' gap",
    "we mean a gap obtained from experimental mass differences with the use of the 5 point formula.@xcite technical details of the applied methods can be found in.@xcite important aspect of our approach is that no free parameters are fitted to obtain collective energies and b(e2 ) transition probabilities .",
    "another important point is that the so - called thouless - valatin corrections and possible effects of the pairing vibrations are simulated in a very rough way by multiplying the mass parameters by the constant factor 1.3 , for a deeper discussion of this point see.@xcite",
    "figs .  [ fig : pot086]-[fig : pot108 ] show potential energy surfaces of selected mo isotopes calculated for both discussed variants of the skyrme interaction in the sextant @xmath16 , @xmath17 of the deformation plane .",
    "the plotted energy is relative to that of a spherical shape of a given nucleus .",
    "additional plot in each figure gives direct comparison of energies of axial shapes for both versions of interaction .",
    "it turns out that in the vicinity of the semi - magic both siii and sly4 give almost identical potential energies , see e.g. fig  [ fig : pot094 ] . for lighter , , and especially for heavier , , isotopes the energy from the siii variant is softer against deformation than the sly4 energy .",
    "one can be tempted to relate this different behaviour with increasing neutron number to different global ( i.e. concerning nuclear matter ) properties of these two interactions , especially the surface properties , see e.g.@xcite .",
    "however , it is not clear if such behaviour can be attributed to only one global property of a given interaction . in the heavier region minima of the potential energy lie close ( or on ) the prolate axis for the siii and close to ( or on ) the oblate axis for the sly4 version ,",
    "see e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig : pot108 ]",
    ". it should be stressed , however , that in the approach applied in this paper the most important is an overall shape of the potential energy and not a precise location of its minimum .",
    "# 1      the six inertial functions ( mass parameters and moments of inertia ) which enter the bohr hamiltonian strongly depend on deformation but are not plotted here for the sake of a limited space .",
    "preliminary analysis shows that differences in the collective spectra ( see section 3.2 ) come from different potential energies rather than from different inertial functions .",
    "theoretical collective energy levels are obtained by solving an eigenproblem of the bohr hamiltonian . for comparison with experimental data@xcite we chose @xmath0 and @xmath1 states ( from the ground state band ) as well as @xmath2 and @xmath3 states that can be considered as bandheads for the quasi-@xmath11 and quasi-@xmath10 bands .",
    "the results are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : lev21]-[fig : lev02 ] .",
    "# 1      generally , both siii and sly4 give similar , quite satisfactory , results , however , it can be clearly seen that differences in potential energies ( see section  [ sec : poten ] ) lead to differences in collective energy levels .",
    "band states and @xmath2 levels are reproduced rather well , with the exception of the case of the semi - magic nucleus .",
    "problems with proper description of collective excitations in magic and , to less extent , in semimagic nuclei are rather typical for approaches similar to one employed in this paper ( note that also in the case of the nucleus the mass parameters are multiplied by the factor 1.3 ) . in the case of @xmath3 states there are notable discrepancies between theory and experiment for the nuclei , however , more detailed studies are needed because it is not clear if the first excited @xmath18 states , which lie very low in this nuclei ( for even lower than @xmath5 level ) can be interpreted as collective quadrupole excitations.@xcite    having determined theoretical collective wave functions one can calculate e2 electromagnetic transition probabilities , which can give deeper insight into the nature of quadrupole collective states . in our approach the collective e2 transition operator is given simply by a quadrupole charge tensor , without any effective charges .",
    "[ fig : ee21 ] shows b(e2 ) reduced probabilities for the @xmath19 transitions within the ground state band .",
    "general conclusion from the results of the present subsection is that the siii version of the skyrme interaction better reproduces experimental data , for both energy levels and b(e2 ) s , than the sly4 version .",
    "however , to judge the goodness of a particular variant of the interaction one should consider also other observables not discussed here , such as absolute binding energies , radii etc .",
    "below we present more detailed results for the nucleus .",
    "[ fig : levmo100 ] shows the lowest energy levels of positive parity , grouped tentatively into bands for the siii variant ( results for the sly4 variant do not differ significantly ) .",
    "qualitatively , the overall theoretical and experimental patterns of energy levels are similar",
    ". however , position of the @xmath10-band and details of the @xmath11 band are not reproduced very well .",
    "table  [ mo100e2 ] contains experimental  @xcite and theoretical values of the reduced probabilities for several e2 transitions in the considered nucleus .",
    "# 1@xmath20 # 1#2    as one can see from table  [ mo100e2 ] , the applied theoretical approach gives good agreement with experiment for the nucleus , especially keeping in mind that there are no effective charges here .",
    "again , the siii results are slightly closer to experiment than those of sly4 .",
    "the main conclusion is that the general bohr hamiltonian based on the atdhfb method with the skyrme interaction describes general trends in collective properties of the mo isotopes reasonably well .",
    "moreover , as it can be seen at least in the presented case of , this approach leads to quite good qualitative agreement with extensive experimental data for both energies and e2 transition probabilities . to be more precise",
    ", we showed this for two ( siii and sly4 ) among plenty of versions of the skyrme interactions . in our opinion a study of collective properties can give an additional criterion when choosing the optimal variant of interaction , or , more generally , the optimal shape of a density energy functional . such searches currently attract much attention .",
    "however there are several questions which need more detailed studies .",
    "let us mention some of them .",
    "firstly , what are the effects of the quadrupole motion on the binding energy of nuclei . to estimate such effects",
    "one should take into account the so called zero point energy corrections given by the gcm method , see e.g.@xcite secondly , the influence of the thouless - valatin terms and of the effects of the pairing vibrations on the collective kinetic energy is simulated in a very rough way.@xcite more precise , quantitative estimation of such effects is still needed .",
