    "the lscher approach  @xcite has become a standard tool to study hadron - hadron scattering processes on the lattice .",
    "the use of this approach in case of elastic scattering is conceptually straightforward : besides technical complications , caused by partial - wave mixing , each measured energy level at a given volume uniquely determines the value of the elastic phase shift at the same energy .    in the presence of multiple channels ,",
    "the extraction of the scattering phase becomes more involved . in case",
    "when only two - particle coupled channels appear , one can make use of the coupled - channel lscher equation  @xcite and fit a simple pole parameterization for the multi - channel @xmath4-matrix elements to the measured energy spectrum in the finite volume  @xcite .",
    "a more sophisticated parameterization of the @xmath4-matrix elements , which is applicable in a wider range of the energies , can be obtained using unitarized chiral perturbation theory ( chpt )  @xcite .",
    "this approach has been successfully applied , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite to analyze coupled - channel @xmath5 @xmath6-wave scattering and to study the properties of the @xmath7-meson .",
    "note the difference to the one - channel case : here , one has to determine several @xmath4-matrix elements ( unknowns ) from a single measurement of a finite - volume energy level .",
    "hence , using some kind of ( phenomenology - inspired ) parameterizations of the multi - channel @xmath4-matrix elements becomes inevitable in practical applications .    in case",
    "when some of the inelastic channels contain three or more particles , the situation is far more complicated . despite the recent progress in the formulation of the theoretical framework  @xcite ,",
    "it is still too cumbersome to be directly used in the analysis of the data .",
    "moreover , the problem of the choice of the parameterization for three - particle scattering might become more difficult ( and lead to even larger theoretical uncertainties ) than in two - particle scattering .    from the above discussion",
    "it is clear that a straightforward extension of the lscher approach through the inclusion of more channels has its limits that are reached rather quickly . on the other hand , many interesting systems , which are already studied on the lattice , may decay into multiple channels . in our opinion ,",
    "the present situation warrants a rethinking of the paradigm .",
    "one may for example explore the possibility to analyze the lattice data without explicitly resolving the scattering into each coupled channel separately .",
    "such a detailed information is usually not needed in practice . instead , in the continuum scattering problem",
    ", the effect of inelastic channels could be included in the so - called optical potential  @xcite , whose imaginary part is non - zero due to the presence of the open inelastic channels . in many cases , it would be sufficient to learn how one extracts the real and imaginary parts of the optical potential from the lattice data , without resorting to the multi - channel lscher approach .",
    "in the present paper , we propose such a method , which heavily relies on the use of twisted boundary conditions  @xcite . due to this",
    ", the method has its own limitations , but there exist certain systems , where it could in principle be applied .",
    "in particular , we have the following systems in mind :    * the scattering in the coupled - channel @xmath8 system in the vicinity of the @xmath9 threshold and the @xmath10 resonance . * the spectrum and decays of the @xmath11 states ; namely , @xmath12 that couples to the channels @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( this system was recently studied in ref .",
    "@xcite ) or the @xmath16 that couples to the @xmath17 and @xmath18 channels ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "there certainly exist other systems where this method can be used .",
    "it should also be stressed that the systems , where the partial twisting ( i.e. , twisting only the valence quarks ) can be carried out , are interesting in the first place  for an obvious reason .",
    "all examples listed above belong to this class . in general , the partial twisting can always be carried out when the annihilation diagrams are absent . in the presence of annihilation diagrams ,",
    "each particular case should be analyzed separately , invoking the methods of effective field theories in a finite volume  @xcite .",
    "the present paper contains an example of such an analysis .",
    "further , note that there exists an alternative method for the extraction of hadron - hadron interaction potentials from the measured bethe - salpeter wave functions on the euclidean lattice .",
    "this method goes under the name of the hal qcd approach and its essentials are explained in refs .",
    "most interesting in the present context is the claim that the hal qcd approach can be extended to the multi - channel systems , including the channels that contain three and more - particles  @xcite .",
    "it should also be pointed out that this approach has already been used to study various systems on the lattice , including the analysis of coupled - channel baryon - baryon scattering ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "it would be interesting to compare our method with the hal qcd approach .",
    "the layout of the present paper is as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : complex_plane ] we discuss the theoretical framework for the extraction of the real and imaginary parts of the optical potential and provide an illustration of the method with synthetic data , generated by using unitarized chpt .",
    "further , in sect .  [ sec : realisticpseudophase ] , we discuss the role of twisted boundary conditions for measuring the optical potential .",
    "namely , the possibility of imposing partially twisted boundary conditions is explored in sect .",
    "[ sec : partialtwisting ] . here",
    ", we also discuss the possibility of imposing the different boundary conditions on the quark and antiquark fields .",
    "the analysis of synthetic data , including an error analysis , is presented in sect .",
    "[ sec : simulation ] . finally , sect .",
    "[ sec : concl ] contains our conclusions .",
    "in the continuum scattering theory , the inelastic channels can be effectively included in the so - called optical potential by using the feshbach projection operator technique  @xcite .",
    "namely , let us start from the multi - channel @xmath19-matrix which obeys the lippmann - schwinger equation @xmath20 here , @xmath21 is the potential and @xmath22 denotes the free green s function with @xmath23 the total energy in the center - of - mass system .",
    "the quantities @xmath24 are all @xmath25 matrices in channel space .    in case when only two - particle intermediate states are present , using dimensional regularization together with the threshold expansion",
    ", it can be shown that the lippmann - schwinger equation   after partial - wave expansion reduces to an algebraic matrix equation ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . with the proper choice of normalization , the matrix @xmath26 in this case takes the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the magnitude of the center - of - mass three - momentum , i.e. , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the masses of particles in the @xmath31 scattering channel .",
    "hence , if dimensional regularization is used in case of two - particle channels , the potential @xmath21 coincides with the multi - channel @xmath4 matrix .",
    "the latter quantity can always be defined , irrespectively of the used regularization .",
    "our final results are of course independent of the use of a particular regularization .",
    "suppose further that we focus on the scattering in a given two - particle channel .",
    "let us introduce the projection operators @xmath6 and @xmath32 , which project on this channel and on the rest , respectively .",
    "in the following , we refer to them as the primary ( index @xmath6 ) and the secondary ( index @xmath33 ) channels .",
    "the secondary channels may contain an arbitrary number of particles .",
    "it is then straightforward to show that the quantity @xmath34 obeys the following single - channel lippmann - schwinger equation @xmath35 where @xmath36    it is easily seen that , while @xmath21 is hermitean , @xmath37 above the secondary threshold(s ) is not .",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath37 is expressed through the transition amplitudes into the secondary channels @xmath38 where @xmath39    for illustration , let us consider scattering in the @xmath40 coupled channels .",
    "let @xmath9 and @xmath41 be the primary and secondary channels , respectively .",
    "then , the formulae for the s - wave scattering take the following form ( we suppress the partial - wave indices for brevity ) : @xmath42 here , @xmath43 @xmath44 , @xmath45 denote the magnitude of the relative three - momenta in the center - of - mass frame in the respective channel , as given in eq .  .",
    "it is often useful to introduce the so - called @xmath46-matrix @xmath47 . in terms of this quantity",
    ", the above formula can be rewritten in the following form : w^-1(e)=m_k|kk|k - .",
    "[ winv ] using the latter form can be justified , when a resonance near the elastic threshold exists that shows up as a pole on the real axis in @xmath21 .",
    "in contrast , the quantity @xmath46 is smooth in this case and can be taylor - expanded near threshold .    in a finite volume",
    ", one may define a counterpart of the scattering amplitude @xmath48 .",
    "imposing , e.g. , periodic boundary conditions leads to the modification of the loop functions ( for simplicity , we restrict ourselves to the s - waves from here on and neglect partial wave mixing ) ip_kz_00(1;q_k^2 ) q_k= , whereas the potential @xmath21 remains unchanged up to exponentially suppressed corrections . in the above expressions , @xmath49 is the size of the cubic box and @xmath50 denotes the lscher zeta - function .",
    "the energy levels of a system in a finite volume coincide with the poles of the modified scattering amplitude .",
    "the position of these poles is determined from the secular equation [ eq : secular ] ( m_k|kk|k- z_00(1;q_k|k^2 ) ) ( m_-z_00(1;q_^2 ) ) -m_k|k^2=0 .",

    "]     for @xmath52 and uniformly distributed values of energy @xmath23 . ]     for @xmath53 ( solid black lines ) and @xmath54 ( dashed blue lines ) versus the real and imaginary parts of the infinite - volume counterpart @xmath55 ( dotted red lines ) .",
    "all quantities are given in units of gev . ]    the main question , which we are trying to answer , can now be formulated as follows : is it possible to extract the real and imaginary parts of @xmath37 from the measurements performed on the lattice ?",
    "we expect that the answer exists and is positive , for the following reason .",
    "let us imagine that all scattering experiments in nature are performed in a very large hall with certain boundary conditions imposed on its walls .",
    "it is _ a priori _ clear that nothing could change in the interpretation of the results of this experiment , if the walls are moved to infinity .",
    "consequently , there _ should _ exist a consistent definition of the infinite - volume limit in a finite - volume theory that yields all quantities defined within the scattering theory in the continuum .",
    "since the optical potential is one of these , there should exist a quantity defined in a finite volume , which coincides with the optical potential in the infinite - volume limit .    in order to find out",
    ", which quantity corresponds to the optical potential in a finite volume and how the infinite - volume limit should be performed , let us follow the same pattern as in the infinite volume .",
    "namely , we apply the one - channel lscher equation for the analysis of data , instead of the two - channel one . as a result",
    ", we get : [ eq : wl ] w_l^-1(e):= z_00(1;q_k|k^2)= m_k|kk|k - .",
    "the left - hand side of this equation is measured on the lattice at fixed values of @xmath44 , corresponding to the discrete energy levels in a finite volume .",
    "methods to measure @xmath56 are discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : realisticpseudophase ] .",
    "the quantity on the right - hand side is proportional to the cotangent of the so - called _ pseudophase _ , defined as the phase extracted with the one - channel lscher equation  @xcite .",
    "it coincides with the usual scattering phase in the absence of secondary channels .",
    "[ fig : pseudophase - exact ] shows the real and imaginary parts of the quantity @xmath55 that is constructed by using a simple parameterization of the two - channel @xmath19-matrix , based on unitarized chpt ( see ref .",

    "the finite - volume counterpart @xmath51 , which is defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : wl ] ) , is also shown .",
    "if the secondary channels were absent , @xmath55 would be real and equal to @xmath51 , up to exponentially suppressed contributions .",
    "[ fig : pseudophase - exact ] clearly demonstrates the effect of neglecting the secondary channels . while the `` true '' function @xmath55 is a smooth ( and complex ) function of energy , the ( real ) function @xmath51 has a tower of poles and zeros .",
    "the ( simple ) zeros of @xmath51 ( poles of @xmath57 ) emerge , when @xmath23 coincides with one of the energy levels in the interacting @xmath41 system .",
    "the background , obtained by subtracting all simple poles , is a smooth function of @xmath23 .",
    "it should be stressed that this statement stays valid even in the presence of multiple secondary channels , some of which containing three or more particles .",
    "the only singularities that emerge in general are the simple poles that can be traced back to the eigenvalues of the total hamiltonian restricted to the subspace of the secondary states . however , assuming the absence of accidental multiple zeros in @xmath57 , one may extend this argument to @xmath51 . ] .",
    "it is important to note that , if @xmath49 tends to infinity , the optical potential does not have a well - defined limit at a given energy . as the energy levels in the secondary channel(s )",
    "condense towards the threshold , the quantity @xmath51 at a fixed @xmath23 oscillates from @xmath58 to @xmath59 .",
    "thus , the question arises , how the quantity @xmath55 can be obtained in the infinite - volume limit .",
    "it should be pointed out that this question has been already addressed in the literature in the past . in this respect , we find ref .  @xcite most useful . in this paper",
    "it is pointed out that , in order to give a correct causal description of the scattering process , one should consider adiabatic switching of the interaction .",
    "this is equivalent to attaching an infinitesimal imaginary part @xmath60 to the energy .",
    "further , as argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , the limits @xmath61 and @xmath62 are not interchangeable .",
    "a correct infinite - volume limit is obtained , when @xmath61 is performed first ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a more detailed discussion of this issue ) .",
    "physically , this statement is clear .",
    "the quantity @xmath63 defines the available energy resolution , and the distance between the neighboring energy levels tends to zero for @xmath61 .",
    "if this distance becomes smaller than the energy resolution , the discrete levels merge into a cut and the infinite - volume limit is achieved .",
    "it is also clear , why the infinite - volume limit does not exist on the real axis : @xmath64 corresponds to an infinitely sharp resolution and the cut is never observed .",
    "the above qualitative discussion can be related to lscher s regular summation theorem  @xcite .",
    "on the real axis above threshold , the zeta - function @xmath65 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : wl ] ) does not have a well - defined limit .",
    "assume , however , that the energy @xmath23 gets a small positive imaginary part , @xmath60 .",
    "the variable @xmath66 also becomes imaginary : q_^2q_^2+()^2 ( 1-)= q_^2+i .",
    "it is immediately seen that above threshold , @xmath67 , the quantity @xmath68 is strictly positive .",
    "now , for real energies @xmath23 , the nearest singularity is located at the distance @xmath63 from the real axis , so the regular summation theorem can be applied .",
    "it can be straightforwardly verified that the remainder term in this theorem vanishes as @xmath69 ( modulo powers of @xmath49 ) , when @xmath61 .",
    "the above argumentation can be readily extended to the cases when intermediate states contain any number of particles .",

    ", we utilize an approach , commonly used in image processing applications .",
    "this approach goes under the name of gaussian smearing .",
    "the basic idea of the gaussian smearing is quite simple : for a given set of uniformly distributed data , any data point is replaced by a linear combination of its neighboring data points ( within a given radius @xmath132 ) , with individual weights , @xmath133 given by @xmath134 here , @xmath135 and @xmath136 denote the distance of the individual points from the central one and the standard deviation .",
    "typically , the latter value is chosen to match the radius of the smearing by @xmath137 .",
    "therefore , the only undetermined quantity is given by the smearing radius @xmath132 .    the general prescription to determine the smearing radius should rely on the properties of the original data only .",
    "recall that the latter is determined by the function @xmath98 in eq .",
    ", which splits up into a real and an imaginary set , when evaluated at the energy @xmath138 for a fixed @xmath139 and uniformly distributed values of @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , after the fits to the ( synthetic ) lattice data are performed , the scale of the structures to be smeared is determined by the distance between two poles , see fig .",
    "[ fig : twisted - fits ] . of course , since the poles are not distributed uniformly over the whole energy range , one could argue in favor of using different values of @xmath132 for different energies .",
    "it is also clear that constraint on the standard deviation @xmath137 affects the result of the smoothing .",
    "however , in order not to over - complicate the procedure , in the following we choose the smearing radius to be twice as large as the typical ( average ) distance between two poles . if the radius is much larger than this , physical information ( i.e. the functional form of the optical potential ) will be smeared out .",
    "if , however , the radius is much smaller than this value , then the ( unphysical ) oscillations will remain , preventing the reconstruction of the underlying optical potential .",
    "the situation is in fact very similar to the under- and over - constrained results , discussed in the previous section for the too small and too large values of @xmath111 .",
    "after the parameters of the smearing kernel are fixed , the method is applied to the sets of real and imaginary parts of @xmath98 at a fixed @xmath139 .",
    "then the procedure is repeated , each time assuming slightly smaller value of @xmath63 than before . in the final step , a simple ( polynomial )",

    "two distinct methods are presented to smear the oscillations which emerge from the analytic continuation , and to recover the optical potential for real energies .",

    "it is provided by the use of twisted boundary conditions and can be realized , e.g. , in the coupled - channel @xmath8 scattering .",
    "namely , as was discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , in this system it is possible to apply ( partially ) twisted boundary conditions so that , when the twisting angle is changed continuously , the @xmath9 threshold moves , whereas the @xmath41 threshold stays intact .",
    "this can be achieved , for example , by twisting the light @xmath143 quarks by the same angle and leaving the @xmath144-quark with periodic boundary conditions .",

    "the method can be used to study the isospin @xmath148 scattering in the @xmath8 system . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , despite the presence of the annihilation diagrams , the partial twisting in this case is equivalent to the full twisting , if the light quarks are twisted , whereas twisting of the @xmath144-quark does not lead to an observable effect . as a rule of thumb , one expects that the partial twisting of a given quark will be equivalent to full twisting , only if this quark line goes through the diagram without being annihilated ( of course , a rigorous proof of this statement should follow by using effective field theory methods  @xcite ) . in our case , we could choose to work with the state with maximal projection of the isospin , say @xmath149 .",
    "this state contains one @xmath150-quark and one @xmath151-quark , which can not be annihilated . choosing the same twisting angle for both quarks",
    ", the system stays in the center - of - mass frame and the pseudophase becomes independent from the twisting angle , as required . from the above discussion",
    "it is also clear that using our method for the extraction of the optical potential in the channel with isospin @xmath152 implies the use of full twisting instead of partial twisting .",
    "the same trick can be used to study the @xmath153 and @xmath16 states , which both have isospin @xmath148 .",
    "twisting @xmath150- and @xmath154-quarks by the same angle , the @xmath155- and @xmath156-mesons will get additional momenta proportional to the twisting angle , whereas the @xmath157 , @xmath158 and @xmath159-mesons will not .",
    "consequently , one may choose the channels containing the @xmath155 and @xmath156 mesons as the primary ones ( in our nomenclature ) and regard every other channel as secondary .",
    "for this choice , the pseudophase will not depend on the twisting angle .",
    "last but not least , an unconventional twisting procedure was used in the study of the @xmath160 scattering from @xmath161 decays  @xcite .",
    "namely , in that work the @xmath162- and @xmath144-quarks were twisted by the angles @xmath163 and @xmath164 , respectively , whereas their hermitean conjugates @xmath165 , @xmath166 were subject to periodic boundary conditions .",
    "albeit in the particular case of @xmath160 scattering the twisting can not be used for the extraction of the optical potential , one could not exclude a possibility that this kind of twisting could be applied in other systems for this purpose .",
    "for this reason , we consider in detail this case of ( unconventional ) twisting in app .",

    "this means that , on the one hand , this approach does not allow one to extract the optical potential below the primary ( @xmath9 ) threshold . on the other hand ,",
    "it is crucial to recall that , due to smearing applied in the complex energy plane , this failure will yield the wrong real and especially imaginary parts of the reconstructed @xmath177 .",
