    "the exact solution of einstein s equations known as the einstein static ( es ) universe is a static closed friedmann - robertson - walker model sourced by a perfect fluid and a cosmological constant ( see @xcite ) .",
    "its stability properties have been widely investigated .",
    "the es universe is unstable to homogeneous perturbations @xcite , moreover it is always neutrally stable against small inhomogeneous vector and tensor perturbations and neutrally stable against adiabatic scalar inhomogeneities with high enough sound speed @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the es universe was recently shown to be unstable to bianchi type - ix spatially homogeneous perturbations in the presence of nontilted and tilted perfect fluids with @xmath0 @xcite and for several kinds of matter fields sources ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the renewed interest in the es universe , besides its historical importance , comes from the emergent universe scenario @xcite , an inflationary cosmological model in which it plays a crucial role as initial state .",
    "this model , in turn , suffers from a fine - tuning problem which is ameliorated when modifications to the cosmological equations of gr are present . for this reason ,",
    "analogous solutions have been considered in several different modified gravity models @xcite and quantum gravity models @xcite . indeed , when dealing with modified cosmological equations , many new static solutions are present , whose stability properties , depending on the details of the single theory or family of theories taken into account , are substantially different from those of the classical es solution of gr .",
    "in particular , neutrally stable solutions are present thus the fine - tuning problem is ameliorated but then a mechanism is needed to get out of the phase of infinite expansions and recollapses and to trigger the expanding phase of the universe@xcite .    here",
    "we study static cosmological solutions in the framework of a covariant massive gravity ( mg ) model recently proposed in @xcite . in order to construct a consistent theory ,",
    "nonlinear terms should be tuned to remove order by order the negative energy state in the spectrum @xcite .",
    "the model under investigation follows from a procedure originally outlined in @xcite and has been found not to show ghosts at the complete nonlinear level with an arbitrary reference metric @xcite .",
    "the considered theory exploits several remarkable features .",
    "indeed the graviton mass typically manifests itself on cosmological scales at late times thus providing a natural explanation of the presently observed accelerating phase @xcite .",
    "moreover , the theory allows for exotic solutions in which the contribution of the graviton mass affects the dynamics at early times . indeed ,",
    "in contrast with gr where , in order to have static solutions , a cosmological constant term and a positive curvature term are needed in addition to a suitable perfect fluid source term , we find that in the considered mg theory it is possible to have static cosmological solutions only sourced by a perfect fluid .",
    "these solutions can be either unstable or neutrally stable and they exist even for spatially flat ( i.e. @xmath1 ) cosmological models .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ massive ] , the nonlinear mg framework considered in this work is shortly described and the modified friedmann equations under investigation are introduced . in sec .",

    "the phase diagrams of the system are drawn both in the @xmath2plane and @xmath3plane . in sec .",
    "[ concl ] , some conclusions are eventually drawn .",
    "we consider the theory introduced in @xcite . in the formalism",
    "afterwards used in @xcite , the theory we refer to is defined on a four - dimensional pseudo - riemannian manifold @xmath4 and the dynamics is determined by the action @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the newton gravitational constant and @xmath7 is the ricci scalar while @xmath8 describes ordinary matter .",
    "the potential term , coupled through a mass term @xmath9 , is defined by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the levi - civita tensor density , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are arbitrary dimensionless real constants and @xmath14 @xmath15 being defined by the relation @xmath16 with @xmath17 a symmetric tensor field .",

    "matter couples minimally to gravity thus its equation of motion is @xmath23 with @xmath24 . from now on we assume a constant equation of state parameter @xmath25 thus @xmath26 .",
    "+ moreover , in the subsequent analysis the parameter space is reduced to the subset @xmath27 since , as found in @xcite , this is the simplest choice that presents a successful veinshtein effect in the weak field limit .    for later purposes it is useful to rewrite eq.([mgfriedmann ] ) as follows : @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 the second friedmann equation reads @xmath32 making use of the friedmann constraint eq.([friedmann ] ) one can recast eq.([ray ] ) as a second order nonlinear differential equation in @xmath33 and its first and second derivatives",

    "the hamilton s equations read @xmath44",
    "by imposing the condition @xmath45 , eq.([fluid ] ) is identically satisfied and the system of eqs.([fluid])-([ray ] ) reduces to an algebraic system in the unknowns @xmath33 and @xmath46 . from this",

    "the stability analysis of the formerly presented solutions can be easily performed using standard dynamical system techniques .",
    "it is easy to check that the solutions in eqs.([static ] ) and ( [ rho ] ) are stationary points of the dynamical system in eqs.([newsys1 ] ) and ( [ newsys2 ] ) .",
    "their stability is readily determined by looking at the eigenvalues of the jacobian matrix evaluated at the stationary points .    since the solutions we are interested in are static ,",
    "once the eigenvalues of the linearized system are determined in general , we can impose @xmath43 ; they then reduce to a particularly simple form @xmath51 with @xmath52.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] according to the sign of @xmath53 evaluated at the stationary points , one can have either a pair of real eigenvalues with opposite signs or a pair of purely imaginary eigenvalues with opposite signs .",
    "thus , the fixed points are either neutrally stable ( i.e. center ) when @xmath54 or unstable ( i.e. a saddle ) when @xmath55 .    for the sake of simplicity we will first consider in details the simplest but interesting case @xmath1 which shares all the relevant features of the other more involved ones .",
    "in the case of spatially flat models the solutions in eq.([static ] ) reduce to the simple expression @xmath56 in which the explicit dependence on @xmath13 has been restored . the corresponding expression for the energy density in terms of the model parameters",
    "can be obtained replacing these solutions in eq.([rho ] ) .",
    "the conditions on the parameters for these solutions to exist can be found by simultaneously imposing @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the results are reported in table [ tab1 ]    .existence conditions for the static solutions of the spatially flat model . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the stability of the solutions is determined by evaluating the eigenvalues in eq.([eigenv ] ) at these fixed points . as already observed ,",
    "the problem simply consists in evaluating the sign of the function @xmath53 in eq.([arg ] ) .",
    "we find that the first solution is always unstable of the saddle type while the second is always ( neutrally ) stable , i.e. , it is a center . in the latter case",
    "the linearized analysis is not sufficient to ensure that the solution is actually stable , indeed the hypotheses of the hartman - grobman theorem are not fulfilled being the point nonhyperbolic .    to further analyze the second solution we use the lyapunov s second method .",
    "let us consider the function @xmath59 as in eq.([hamilton ] ) with @xmath1 and define @xmath60 @xmath61 is positive - definite in a neighborhood @xmath62 around the second solution , i.e. @xmath63 thus it is a good lyapunov function candidate .",
    "its time derivative is zero in a neighborhood of the fixed point i.e. @xmath64 thus the second solution is proven to be stable .",
    "the result is also confirmed by numerically integrating the fully nonlinear system ( see sec.[num ] ) .    figs .",
    "[ flat1 ] and [ flat2 ] show regions in the @xmath65plane in which sol.1 and sol.2 are admitted , respectively ; the former being unstable while the latter being stable .",

    "it is interesting to note that the phase space of the system exploits relevant changes in its qualitative structure according to the parameters values .",
    "in particular , the system undergoes bifurcations that can be singled out , for instance , by looking at the eigenvalues characterizing the stability of the fixed points .    in fig .",

    "further details about this feature are discussed in the following sections ( see sec.[num ] ) .",

    "the existence region of the first solution consists of three parts while the existence region of the second solution is compact ( see fig .  [ closed ] ) .",
    "these regions have two intersections , which means that for values of the parameter within such regions , both solutions are admitted simultaneously , otherwise either only one of the two solutions is admitted or no solutions are admitted .",
    "this also indicates that in the spatially closed models the phase space has a richer structure and several bifurcations can occur .",

    "such a mechanism has no dynamical explanation thus it looks quite unsatisfactory as well .",
