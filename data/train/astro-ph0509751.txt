    "hd  37776 = hip  26742 = v901  ori , b1iv , is a member of the well studied orion  ob  1 association .",
    "the star was recognized as a helium - strong cp star by nissen ( 1976 ) .",
    "pedersen & thomsen ( 1977 ) and pedersen ( 1979 ) published 54 excellent _ uvby _ and 53 photometric measurements of the hei@xmath1 line of the star revealing it as both a low amplitude spectrum and light variable with a rotational period of @xmath2 days .",
    "walborn ( 1982 ) and shore & brown ( 1990 ) reported on the periodic variability of its h , he , c , si and perhaps mg spectral lines .",
    "thompson & landstreet ( 1985 ) found an extraordinary double - wave magnetic curve with a period of 1.53869 days and argued that this star has a dominantly quadrupolar field geometry .",
    "adelman & pyper ( 1985 ) and adelman ( 1997 ) obtained spectrophotometry and two sets of _ uvby _ photometry ( 18 and 42 observations respectively ) .",
    "adelman defined the period more precisely and gave the ephemeris : @xmath3 @xmath4 is an integer .",
    "the zero phase corresponds to the first magnetic maximum after thompson & landstreet @xcite .",
    "the star was photometrically observed in a near infrared region ( catalano & leone 1998 , 40 observations in _ jhk _ colours ) and by hipparcos ( 103 @xmath5 measurements , esa 1997 ) .",
    "one of unsolved problems of the physics of the he  strong / he  weak mcp stars is the nature of photometric spots on their surfaces which are the cause of the observed photometric variations of these stars .",
    "we have chosen hd  37776 as a prototype of the he - strong mcp group of stars as it seems to us to be a relatively simple and at the same time very well monitored object .",
    "a partial step of our research was to improve the rotational ephemeris of the star , so that it was applicable to the whole interval of 35 years covered by measurements of all kind .    for this purpose we used all the satisfactorily accurate photometric data available , namely the 3 sets of _ uvby _ observations ( pedersen & thomsen 1977 , adelman & pyper 1985 and adelman 1997 ) and @xmath6 measurements ( esa 1997 ) .",
    "this material comprises 559 individual measurements in 5 photometric colours and spans over 20 years .",
    "the data were processed by our own code based on the principal component analysis using the robust regression approaches ( mikulek et al .",
    "2005 and 2003 ) .",
    "the departures we found in the ( o - c ) _ vs. _ linear light elements dependence lead us to introducing a quadratic term in to the ephemeris .",
    "then the moments of the maxima of the light curves , @xmath7 , are given by the relation : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the moment of the basic maximum for the @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 is the epoch , overlines denote the mean weighted values of a quantity , @xmath12 is the mean period corresponding to linear approximation , @xmath13 is the derivative of the instantaneous period , @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "it is very likely the period is truly increasing as the value of @xmath13 is 7-times larger than its uncertainty .",
    "the mean period @xmath12 is exactly equal to the adelman s value but with the error significantly reduced .",
    "reiners et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , as well as oksala & townsend ( 2006 ) noticed increase of a period of another magnetic he - strong star : @xmath16 ori e. using the period given in the latter paper and the value given in hesser et al .",
    "( 1977 ) we inferred the rate of spindown of the star : @xmath17 , in a good agreement with the one given by reiners et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , i. e. @xmath18 .",
    "the helium - strong stars represent a relatively small group of early b stars ( b1v to b3v ) that show unusually strong he lines for their effective temperature .",
    "they are believed to represent a high - temperature extension of the classical magnetic ap / bp stars .",
    "the observed chemical peculiarity is probably a consequence of elemental separation under influence of stellar wind .",
    "provided that the period change ( 3 ) is due to a momentum loss through a magnetically confined stellar wind , then the period change is ( assuming a rigid - body rotation ) : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the radius of the effective corotation , @xmath21 is a geometric factor , @xmath22 is the stellar moment of inertia given by a dimensionless constant @xmath23 and the stellar mass @xmath24 and radius @xmath25 . let us assume that @xmath26 is given by the alfvn radius ( weber & davis @xcite ) and that the mass - loss rate corresponds to the value required by the diffusion theory @xmath27 m@xmath28/year ( michaud et al .",
    "@xcite ) . for hd37776 with @xmath29",
    "we obtain @xmath30 and the spin - down rate @xmath31 consistent with our finding . for the mass - loss rates anticipated by the decoupling theory ( hunger & groote @xcite ) , @xmath32 m@xmath33 we obtain the same spin - down rate since @xmath20 is now lower .",
    "the nonzero @xmath13 ( if real ) however , could also be explained by e.g. the light time effect due to an unresolved secondary .",
    "new photometric and spectroscopic observations of the star that are expected to help resolving the problem are in progress .",
