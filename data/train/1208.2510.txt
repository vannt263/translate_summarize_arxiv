    "db white dwarf atmospheres belong to the class of astrophysical objects which have been investigated for a long time and from various aspects @xcite . in the previous period ,",
    "the contribution of the authors of this paper was related to the research of optical properties of db white dwarf atmospheres within the range of average effective temperatures @xmath3 .",
    "so , the papers of @xcite and of @xcite were dedicated to the research of continual absorption in the optical part of em spectra , the paper of @xcite - to the research of chemi - ionization / recombination processes and of @xcite - to the investigation of continual absorption in the vuv region of em spectra .",
    "recently , the transport properties of helium plasmas , characteristic of some db white dwarf atmospheres , attracted the authors attention , first of all the electrical conductivity .",
    "namely , the data on electrical conductivity of plasma of stars with a magnetic field or moving in the magnetic field of the other component in a binary system ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) could be of significant interest , since they are useful for the study of thermal evolution of such objects ( cooling , nuclear burning of accreted matter ) and the investigation of their magnetic fields .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite studied electrical conductivity for stars of various spectral types , in order to investigate the magnetohydrodynamic differences in their atmospheres .",
    "recently , @xcite investigated he conductivity in cool white dwarf atmospheres , since the possibility of using these stars for dating stellar populations has generated a renewed interest in modelling their cooling rate @xcite . also , the transport processes occurring in the cores of white dwarfs ( see e.g. @xcite and numerous references therein ) have been considered . moreover ,",
    "electrical conductivity was particularly investigated for solar plasma , since it is of interest for consideration of various processes in the observed atmospheric layers , like the relation between magnetic field and convection , the question of magnetic field dissipation and the energy released by such processes ( see e. g. @xcite and references therein ) . for example @xcite investigated the role of electrical conductivity in the construction of a theoretical model of the upper solar atmosphere , and @xcite considered the electrical conductivity of solar plasma for magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the solar chromospheric dynamo .",
    "given that electrical conductivity plays an analogous role in other stars as well , it is of interest to investigate its significance , to adapt the methods for research into stellar plasma conditions and to provide the needed data .",
    "an additional interest for data on electrical conductivity in white dwarf atmospheres may be stimulated by the search for extra - solar planets .",
    "namely @xcite have shown that a planetary core in orbit around a white dwarf may reveal its presence through its interaction with the magnetosphere of the white dwarf .",
    "such an interaction will generate electrical currents that will directly heat the atmosphere near its magnetic poles .",
    "@xcite emphasize that this heating may be detected within the optical wavelength range as h@xmath4 emission .",
    "for investigation and modelling of mentioned electrical currents , the data on electrical conductivity in white dwarf atmospheres will be useful .",
    "one of the most frequently used approximations for consideration of transport properties of different plasmas is the approximation of `` fully ionized plasma '' @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the electrical conductivity of fully ionized plasmas can be successfully calculated using the modified random - phase approximation ( rpa ) @xcite in the region of strong and moderate non - ideality , while the weakly non - ideal plasmas were successfully treated within the semiclassical approximation ( sc ) @xcite . in practice ,",
    "even the plasmas with a significant neutral component are treated as fully ionized in order to simplify the considered problems , @xcite .",
    "however , our preliminary estimates have shown that such an approach is not applicable for the helium plasmas of db white dwarf atmospheres described in @xcite , where the influence of neutral component can not be neglected",
    ".    therefore , an adequate method for calculations of electrical conductivity of dense , partially ionized helium plasmas is developed in this paper .",
    "this method represents a generalization of methods developed in @xcite and @xcite , namely modified rpa and sc methods , and gives a possibility to estimate the real contribution of the neutral component to the static electrical conductivity of the considered helium plasmas within a wide range of mass densities ( @xmath5 ) and temperatures ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the calculations were performed for helium plasma in the state of local thermodynamical equilibrium with given @xmath5 and @xmath6 for @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the obtained results are compared with the corresponding experimental data ( @xcite ) . for the calculations of plasma characteristics of db white dwarf atmospheres the data from @xcite",
    "were used .",
    "on the basis of the previous paper of @xcite , a modified rpa method for calculation of static conductivity of fully ionized plasma was developed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the principal role in this method belongs to the formula for energy - dependent electron - electron ( ee ) and electron - ion ( ei ) relaxation times @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the energy of single electron state , determined as a sum over the matsubara frequencies by using the methods of green function theory .",
    "this method is especially suitable for calculation of electrical conductivity of dense non - ideal plasmas with electron density ( @xmath11 ) larger than @xmath12 @xmath13 . in the region",
    "@xmath14 @xmath13 the static conductivity of fully ionized plasmas can be determined well using the sc method developed in @xcite , which is also based on electron relaxation time @xmath15 .",
    "it is important that sc method gives practically the same results as rpa method in a wider region of the electron densities around the value of @xmath16 @xmath13 .",
    "sc method was tested from this aspect in @xcite , where it was experimentally verified through comparison with the results from @xcite and @xcite , just for the helium plasmas .    however , as it was already mentioned , the helium plasma of the considered db white dwarf atmospheres contains significant neutral atom component , as follows from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "because of that , we will start here from the fact that in both rpa and sc methods effective electron relaxation times @xmath17 can be expressed as @xmath18 where @xmath10 is the electron energy , and @xmath19 - the corresponding total electron - electron and electron - ion collision frequency .",
    "this gives a possibility to generalize the modified rpa and sc methods for the case of partially ionized plasmas , replacing @xmath20 by @xmath21 @xmath22 where @xmath23 is an effective electron - atom collision frequency .",
    "consequently , the basic rpa and sc expressions for the static electrical conductivity @xmath24 transform to the corresponding frost - like expressions @xmath25}\\cdot\\frac{df_{fd}(e)}{de}de,\\ ] ] where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the mass and the modulus of charge of the electron , @xmath28 is the density of the single electron states in the energy space , @xmath29 is the fermi - dirac distribution function for given @xmath11 and temperature @xmath6 , and @xmath9 or @xmath30 .",
    "on the basis of composition and temperature data of the considered db white dwarf atmospheres @xcite , one can note that only four components of these atmospheres are important for determination of @xmath24 : free electrons , @xmath31 and @xmath32 ions , and helium atoms . in accordance with this",
    ", the expression for @xmath33 from @xcite can be presented in the form @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the planck and boltzmann constants respectively , @xmath37 and @xmath38 - the charges of electron and @xmath39 and @xmath32 ions ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 ) , @xmath43 and @xmath44 - the corresponding helium ion densities , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 - the electron and ion polarization operators , @xmath48 - the dielectric function , @xmath49 , and summation is extended over all the matsubara frequencies @xmath50 . the detailed expressions for polarization operators and dielectric functions are given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the sc expression for @xmath24 is applied to the outer layers of the considered db white dwarf atmospheres where @xmath51 @xmath13 and the presence of @xmath32 ions can be neglected .",
    "because of that the expression for @xmath52 , in accordance with @xcite , can be taken in the form @xmath53^{-1 } , \\qquad \\lambda_{i}=\\frac{2e}{z_{i1}e^{2}}\\cdot r_{ci},\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is boltzmann constant and @xmath55 .",
    "the correction factor @xmath56 is determined within sc method , while @xmath57 is the corresponding screening length which is an external parameter of the theory .",
    "the values of @xmath58 for @xmath55 and @xmath59 are taken from @xcite . here",
    ", value @xmath60 is taken as the screening length , where the ion neutrality radius @xmath61 is given by the expressions obtained in @xcite .",
    "such a choice of the screening length provides overlapping sc and rpa values of @xmath24 in a wider region of the electron densities around the value of @xmath16 @xmath13 .",
    "finally , the electron - atom collision frequency @xmath23 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma0 ] ) is given here by the known expression @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the @xmath64 atom density , @xmath65- relative electron - atom velocity , and @xmath66- the transport cross - section for the elastic @xmath67 scattering @xcite .",
    "the exact quantum - mechanical calculation of the transport cross - section for elastic electron - atom collisions is a very hard problem in itself .",
    "however , in the case of @xmath67 scattering the problem becomes easier within the considered temperature range where all non - elastic collision processes can be neglected .",
    "namely , in this case it can be treated as scattering of electrons in an adequately chosen model potential @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the distance between the electron and the nucleus of @xmath64 atom .",
    "thus , the electron movement is described by a wave function @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is a spherical harmonic function of degree @xmath72 and order @xmath26 , while the function @xmath73 satisfies the radial schrodinger equation @xmath74\\chi ( r ) = e \\chi ( r),\\ ] ] given in atomic units . following the previous paper of @xcite , we take the model potential @xmath68 in the form @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the charge of the nucleus of a helium atom , @xmath77 and @xmath78 describe the redistribution of electrons in the @xmath79 shell of the helium atom ( @xmath80 ) , @xmath81 is the polarizability of @xmath64 atom , and @xmath82 has the meaning of the average radius of atom .",
    "parameters @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 are determined from the conditions of continuity and smoothness of the potential @xmath68 at the points @xmath87 and @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the values of the mentioned quantities are given in table  ( [ tab : koef_u ] ) .",
    "the equation ( [ eq : rse ] ) is solved by the partial wave method described in @xcite .",
    "one obtains as the result the phase shifts @xmath91 for @xmath92 , where each @xmath91 corresponds to the partial wave with a given orbital number @xmath72 .",
    "this way of solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : rse ] ) has advantages since , apart from the transport cross - section @xmath93 it allows determination of the elastic cross - section , as well as cross - sections of higher order ( viscosity cross - section , etc . ) .",
    "as one can see in figure  [ fig : qtr ] , there is an excellent agreement between the values of @xmath94 calculated using the potential ( [ eq : u(r ) ] ) and various experimental and theoretical data of other authors .",
    ".the parameter values of the model potential @xmath68 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : u(r ) ] ) in atomic units [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : ec ]    in order to provide possibility for direct applications of our results to different theoretical investigations the values of static electrical conductivity @xmath24 of helium plasma in a wide range of @xmath5 and @xmath6 are given in table  [ tab : ec ] .",
    "this table covers plasma conditions for all models of db white dwarf atmospheres presented in @xcite and the corresponding values of @xmath24 were determined for the helium plasmas in the state of local thermodynamical equilibrium with given @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the method developed in this paper represents also a powerful tool for research into white dwarfs with different atmospheric compositions ( da , dc etc . ) , and for investigation of some other stars ( m - type red dwarfs , sun etc . ) .",
    "finally , the presented method provides a basis for the development of methods to describe other transport characteristics which are important for the study of all mentioned astrophysical objects , such as the electronic thermo - conductivity in the star atmosphere layers with large electron density , electrical conductivity in the presence of strong magnetic fields and dynamic ( high frequency ) electrical conductivity .",
