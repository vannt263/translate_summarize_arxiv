    "the discovery of a class of pulsating hot subdwarfs ( sdbs ; @xcite ) has created an interest in asteroseismology of evolved stars . subdwarfs are believed to lie on the extreme horizontal branch @xcite , although their formation and evolution is still uncertain .",
    "pulsations in sdbs were predicted theoretically by @xcite just prior to their discovery , and about 20 pulsators have been discovered to date using time - series photometry ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the stars ( also known as ec14026 stars , after the prototype ) are believed to pulsate in @xmath2 modes and typically have periods 100200s and semi - amplitudes @xmath310mmag .",
    "models indicate an opacity bump associated with iron ionisation may be the driving mechanism of the pulsations @xcite , although recent studies by @xcite find no well - defined instability strip in the log@xmath4 plane .",
    "combining time - series photometry with time - series spectroscopy should help to give a better understanding of the pulsations in these stars .",
    "we have shown the feasibility of time - series spectroscopy with observations of pg1605 + 072 on a 1.5 m telescope over 2 hrs @xcite .",
    "@xcite made similar observations of kpd2109 + 4401 ( 5hrs ) and pb8783 ( 6hrs ) using the 4.2 m william herschel telescope .",
    "in all three cases , velocity variations were detected at the published photometric frequencies .",
    "however , sdb stars are multimode pulsators and longer time series are needed to resolve the individual modes and measure their amplitudes .",
    "we present here the first extended time - series spectroscopy of a pulsating sdb star .",
    "our target was pg1605 + 072 which has the most extreme properties of all the pulsating sdbs detected so far , with high amplitudes ( up to @xmath525mmag ) and long periods ( @xmath5500s ) .",
    "because of its low gravity ( log@xmath6@xmath55.25 ) , this star is believed to have evolved off the horizontal branch and may oscillate in @xmath6 , as well as @xmath2 modes @xcite .",
    "the power spectrum is complex , with up to 55 indentifiable frequencies .",
    "pg1605 + 072 displays considerable rotation ( @xmath7sin@xmath8kms@xmath0 ) , possibly leading to unequally spaced multiplet components @xcite . unlike several of the pulsating sdbs , multicolour photometry gives no indication of a cool companion @xcite .",
    "we obtained medium - resolution spectra of pg1605 + 072 using the dfosc spectrograph on the danish 1.54 m telescope at la silla , chile and the coud spectrograph ( a grating ) on the 74-inch ( 1.88 m ) telescope at mt stromlo , australia .",
    "the observations were made on 7 nights over an 11-day period in july and august , 1999 ( see table [ spec ] ) . to supplement the spectroscopy , we obtained time - series photometry at the sutherland site of the south african astronomical observatory ( see table [ phot ] ) .    the la silla data consisted of single - order spectra projected onto a 2k loral ccd - pixel - binning ( to reduce r.o.n . ) and windowing ( to reduce readout time ) gave 66 x 500 pixel spectra with a total wavelength range of 37005000  and a dispersion of 1.65pixel@xmath0 .",
    "the resolution was 2.8 , set by a slit width of 1.5 arcsec .",
    "the exposure time was 46s , with a dead time of about 15s .",
    "the average number of photons per   in each spectrum was about 2200 .    the mt stromlo data consisted of single - order spectra projected onto a site 2kx4k ccd , with a wavelength range of 38005000 .",
    "the slit width was @xmath54 arcsec and the dispersion was 0.60pixels@xmath0 , leading to a resolution similar to that of the la silla data .",
    "the exposure time was 50s with a dead time of around 25s .",
    "the photometry from sutherland was taken using the modular photometer with a johnson @xmath9 filter and exposure times of 20s .",
    "the gaas photomultiplier tube in this photometer has a good red sensitivity , and using the blue filter causes the passband to resemble that of a blue - sensitive photomultiplier tube @xcite .",
    "standard methods for bias subtraction , flat - fielding and background scattered - light subtraction were used .",
    "non - linearities on the ccd image were only important in the stromlo data , and were corrected immediately after bias subtraction ( * ? ? ? * see ) .",
    "one - dimensional spectra were extracted using the optimal extraction method @xcite , a variance weighting system for ccd columns .",
    "a 3rd order polynomial was fitted to the continuum level in both data sets , and the spectra were normalised to a continuum value of unity .",
    "the spectrum of pg1605 + 072 is dominated by balmer lines - see e.g. figure 9 of @xcite .",
    "a cross - correlation technique was used to determine the doppler shift for five balmer lines ( h@xmath1 , h@xmath10 , h@xmath11 , h@xmath12 and h8 ) , relative to a template spectrum ( the average of 20 high - quality spectra ) .",
    "the spectra and template were prepared in the manner described by @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the time - series for h@xmath10 does not contain any mt stromlo data , because that line was contaminated by a bad ccd column .",
    "several jumps were found in each time - series , particularly in the la silla data , occurring every 30 - 40 observations , corresponding to breaks where the he+ne calibration spectra were taken .",
    "we decided to process each of these groups separately with a template spectrum created for each group . in removing the jumps",
    ", we have effectively high - pass filtered the dataset , also removing any instrumental drifts present .",
    "the photometric data were reduced by subtracting the sky background , correcting for atmospheric extinction and normalising to the mean intensity of the run , following a method similar to @xcite .",
    "slow drifts were not corrected for in the photometry .    the h@xmath1 velocity curves and b magnitude light curves for each night of observations are shown in figure [ rawvel ] .",
    "oscillations are not as evident in our velocity curve as they are in the light curve , since the signal - to - noise per measurement is lower .",
    "as is common with time - series measurements , the quality of the data varies considerably through the data set .",
    "we therefore performed frequency analysis using a weighted fourier transform , where weights were assigned according to the local rms scatter @xcite .",
    "the amplitude spectra of h@xmath1 and h@xmath10 are shown in the top two panels on the left of figure [ comp ] .",
    "the white noise level is 1.07kms@xmath0 for h@xmath1 and 0.93kms@xmath0 for h@xmath10 .",
    "oscillations are clearly visible at 2102@xmath13hz and 2743@xmath13hz ( 2742.72@xmath13hz in @xcite ) in both lines but at 1891@xmath13hz ( 1891.42@xmath13hz ) only in h@xmath10 .",
    "it is unclear whether this last effect is due to the low amplitude of the mode in h@xmath1 due to beating between closely spaced modes .",
    "the bottom two panels show our @xmath9 magnitude and white light amplitude spectra ( from a 15-day multisite campaign by @xcite in may , 1997 ; white light observations were obtained using a cuso@xmath14 filter ) respectively , and are included for comparison .",
    "the three modes previously mentioned are all present in the @xmath9 magnitude spectrum . we believe that the highest amplitude peak ( 14kms@xmath0 for h@xmath1 ) at 2102@xmath13hz may be a combination of the 2101.65@xmath13hz and 2103.28@xmath13hz frequencies found by @xcite  a longer time - series is needed to clarify this .    the panels on the right of figure [ comp ] show the 2050@xmath152150@xmath13hz region in greater detail .",
    "the highest amplitude mode found by @xcite at 2075.76@xmath13hz is not present in any of our observations .",
    "it is not clear whether this is due to variation in amplitudes over the 2.2 years between observations , or to beating between very closely spaced modes .",
    "the @xmath9 magnitude and white light amplitudes differ by around 40% , which is to be expected in such hot , blue stars , considering that the effective wavelength of white light is redder than the @xmath9 band .",
    "if oscillation phase is wavelength dependent , then this would also reduce the amplitude in white light ( which is a much broader `` band '' than @xmath9 ) .      in this letter",
    "we present a qualitative comparison of luminosity and velocity amplitudes .",
    "all amplitudes were measured by the height of their peak .",
    "a more detailed quantative study will be the subject of a subsequent paper .",
    "@xcite derived a relationship between luminosity amplitude at a given wavelength and velocity amplitude for classical and solar - like oscillations .",
    "using their scaling law , which assumes a black body spectrum and adiabatic oscillations , we find that the velocity amplitudes in pg1605 + 072 are 23 times lower than expected .",
    "however a black body and adiabatic assumption is far from valid in such a hot star when one is considering amplitudes in visual . in a pure adiabatic assumption",
    "there is a 180  phase difference between temperature and stellar radius ( with maximum brightness coinciding with minimum radius ) . for the mode at 2.742mhz ( which do not appear to be contaminated by closely spaced modes )",
    ", we find a phase difference of ( -75@xmath1610 )  implying that maximum brightness is slightly after maximum radius .",
    "more data are needed to clarify this result .",
    "there is evidence to suggest that the velocity amplitude is wavelength dependent .",
    "figure [ wave ] shows that the amplitude of oscillations at two frequencies decreases blueward of h@xmath1 .",
    "the amplitude of h8 is almost 25% smaller than that of h@xmath1 .",
    "if confirmed , this would be puzzling , given that all the balmer lines are formed in the same part of the atmosphere .",
    "the results presented here show that times - series spectroscopy of sdbs can be done using a medium - size ( 1.5 m ) telescope .",
    "we have detected oscillations in velocity at previously published photometric frequencies .",
    "a longer times - series would allow most of the closely spaced modes in pg1605 + 072 to be resolved and thus help to confirm the variation of velocity amplitude with wavelength .",
    "further studies may also determine whether the amplitudes of modes in this star are variable over time , or whether the apparent shift in primary pulsation mode is due to beating .",
    "we will also examine the behaviour of equivalent width and other line profile variations .",
