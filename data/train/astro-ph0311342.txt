    "one of the most striking visual features in the distribution of galaxies in the las campanas redshift survey ( lcrs , shectman et al .",
    "1996 ) is that they appear to be distributed along filaments .",
    "these filaments are interconnected and form a network , with voids largely devoid of galaxies comprising the region in between the filaments .",
    "this network of interconnected filaments encircling voids extends across the entire survey and may be referred to as the `` cosmic web '' .",
    "similar networks of filaments and voids are also visible in other galaxy surveys , e.g. , cfa ( geller & huchra 1989 ) , 2dfgrs ( colless et al .",
    "2001 , colless et al . 2003 ) and sdss ( edr ) ( stoughton et al .",
    "2002 , abazajian et al .",
    "these , if they are a genuine feature of the galaxy distribution , represent the largest structural elements in the hierarchy of structures observed in the universe , namely galaxies , clusters , superclusters , filaments and the cosmic web .",
    "the analysis of filamentary patterns in the galaxy distribution has a long history dating back to papers by zeldovich , einasto and shandarin ( 1982 ) , shandarin and zeldovich ( 1983 ) and einasto et al .",
    "( 1984 ) . in the last paper",
    "the authors analyze the distribution of galaxies in the local supercluster .",
    "they use the friend - of - friend algorithm with varying neighborhood radius to identify connected systems of galaxies referred to as `` clusters '' .",
    "as they increase the neighborhood radius , they find that the clusters which are initially spherical become multi - branched with multiple filaments of lengths up to several tens of @xmath6mpc extending out in different directions . finally ,",
    "as the radius is increased further , they find that the filaments get interconnected and join neighboring superclusters into an infinite network of superclusters and voids . a later study ( shandarin & yess 2000 ) used percolation analysis to arrive at a similar conclusion for the distribution of the lcrs galaxies .",
    "the large - scale and super large - scale structures in the distribution of the lcrs galaxies have also been studied by doroshkevich et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and doroshkevich et al .",
    "( 1996 ) who find evidence for a network of sheet like structures which surround underdense regions ( voids ) and are criss - crossed by filaments . the distribution of voids in the lcrs has been studied by m \" uller , arbabi - bidgoli , einasto & tucker ( 2000 ) and the topology of the lcrs by trac , mitsouras , hickson & brandenberger ( 2002 ) and colley ( 1997 ) . a recent analysis ( einasto et al .",
    "2003a ) indicates a supercluster - void network in the sloan digital sky survey also .",
    "traditionally , correlation functions ( peebles 1993 ) have been used to quantify the statistical properties of the galaxy distribution . for the lcrs ,",
    "the two - point correlation function is a power law , ( r ) = ( rr_o)^-1.52 with the correlation length @xmath7 @xmath6mpc on scales @xmath8mpc to @xmath9mpc . on scales larger than @xmath10mpc , @xmath11(r ) fluctuates closely around zero indicating a statistically homogeneous galaxy distribution at and beyond these scales ( tucker et al .",
    "this raises the question whether the filamentary features which appear to span scales larger than @xmath12mpc are statistically significant features of the galaxy distribution or if they are mere artifacts arising from chance alignment of the galaxies .",
    "a quantitative estimator of filamentary structure , shapefinder , was defined ( bharadwaj et al . 2000 ) to provide a measure of the average filamentarity for a point distribution in 2d .",
    "( see sahni , sathyaprakash & shandarin 1998 for general introduction to shapefinders and sheth et al .",
    "2003 for the application of shapefinders to 3d simulations of structure formation . )",
    "the shapefinder statistic was used to demonstrate that the galaxy distribution in the lcrs exhibits a high degree of filamentarity compared to a random poisson distribution having the same geometry and selection effects as the survey .",
    "this analysis provides objective confirmation of the visual impression that the galaxies _ are _ distributed along filaments .",
    "this , however , does not establish the statistical significance of the filaments .",
    "the features identified as filaments are essentially chains of galaxies , a crucial requirement being that the spacing between any two successive galaxies along a chain is significantly smaller than the mean inter - galaxy separation .",
    "a chain runs as long as it is possible to find another nearby galaxy which is not yet a member of the chain , and breaks when no such galaxy is to be found .",
    "the fact that the lcrs galaxies are highly clustered on small scales increases the probability of finding pairs of galaxies at small separations .",
    "this enhances the occurrence of long chains of galaxies , and we expect to find a higher degree of filamentarity arising just from chance alignments in the lcrs compared to a poisson distribution . to establish whether the observed filaments are statistically significant or if they are a result of chance alignments of smaller structural elements , it is necessary to compare the sample of galaxies ( here , the lcrs slices ) with a distribution of points which has the same small scale clustering properties as the original sample and for which we know that all large - scale filamentary features are solely due to chance alignments .",
    "this is achieved using a statistical technique called shuffle ( bhavsar & ling 1988 ) whereby the statistical significance of the filamentarity in a clustered dataset can be assessed .",
    "shuffle generates fake data - sets , practically identical in their clustering properties to the original data up to a length scale @xmath13 , but in which all structures longer than @xmath13 , both real and chance , of the original data , have been eliminated . in these shuffled data ,",
    "filaments spanning length - scales larger than @xmath13 are visually evident , even expected to be identified as a signal by the statistics used to quantify the filamentarity , but all filaments spanning length - scales larger than l have formed accidentally .",
    "the measure of the occurrence of filaments spanning length - scales larger than @xmath13 in the shuffled data gives us a statistical estimate of the level at which chance filaments spanning length - scales larger than @xmath13 occur in the original data .",
    "here we use shuffle to estimate the degree of filamentarity expected from chance alignments in the lcrs and use this to determine the statistical significance of the observed filamentarity .",
    "we present the method of analysis and our findings in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we discuss our results and present conclusions .",
    "the lcrs contains the angular positions and redshifts of 26,418 galaxies distributed in 6 wedges , each @xmath14 thick in declination and @xmath15 in right ascension .",
    "three wedges are centered around mean declinations @xmath2 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 in the northern galactic cap and three at declinations @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 in the southern galactic cap .",
    "the survey has a magnitude limit @xmath21 and extends to a distance of @xmath22mpc .",
    "the most prominent visual feature in these wedges ( figure 1 ) is that the galaxies appear to be distributed along filaments , several of which span length - scales of @xmath23mpc or more .",
    "we extracted luminosity and volume limited sub - samples ( figure 1 ) from the lcrs data so that we have an uniform sampling of the regions that we analyze . in order to sample the largest regions that we could , with the above criterion in mind , we limited the wedges from @xmath24 to @xmath25mpc in the radial direction as shown in figure 1 .",
    "our data consist of a total of 5073 galaxies distributed in 6 wedges .",
    "each lcrs wedge is collapsed along its thickness ( in declination ) resulting in a 2 dimensional truncated conical slice which , being geometrically flat , can be unrolled onto a plane .",
    "each slice is embedded in a @xmath26mpc @xmath27mpc rectangular grid .",
    "grid cells with galaxies in them are assigned the value 1 , empty cells 0 .",
    "connected regions of filled cells are identified as clusters using a `` friends - of - friends''(fof ) algorithm .",
    "the geometry and topology of each cluster is described by its area @xmath28 , perimeter @xmath29 , and genus @xmath30 .",
    "it is possible to utilize these measures to assess the filamentarity of the supercluster of interest .",
    "this is achievable using a set of measures termed as shapefinders , originally defined for 2d hypersurfaces embedded in 3d .",
    "we use a 2d version of the shapefinder in our analysis of the superclusters in the lcrs slices .",
    "however , before presenting our results , we digress briefly and summarize the definition and the conceptual foundation of the shapefinder measures .",
    "the geometry of a given structure is sensitive to any deformation which the structure undergoes , while the topology of the structure , solely relating to the connectedness of the structure , remains unaffected .",
    "the morphology and the size of the objects is a result of the interplay between both these aspects .",
    "the shapefinders are statistics devised to utilize both geometric and topological information of a given object , to make a meaningful statement about its size and its morphology .",
    "both the geometry and topology of an object are characterized in terms of minkowski functionals ( hereafter mfs ) . in 3d ,",
    "the geometric mfs are ( 1 ) the volume @xmath31 , ( 2 ) the surface area @xmath32 and ( 3 ) the integrated mean curvature @xmath33 , whereas the fourth mf is a topological invariant , the genus @xmath34 .",
    "sahni et al .",
    "( 1998 ) defined three shapefinders as the ratio s of the above mfs , so as to have the dimensions of length .",
    "these are conventionally considered to be reminiscent of the characteristic thickness @xmath35 , breadth @xmath36 and length @xmath37 ) of the object , and thus , together with genus @xmath34 , give us a feel for the typical _ size _ and _ topology _ of the object of interest .",
    "the information content about the three characteristic length - scales associated with the object can further be used to make an objective statement about the morphology of the object , as to how spherical , planar , ribbon - like or filamentary an object is .",
    "sahni et al .",
    "( 1998 ) proposed to achieve this by using two dimensionless shapefinders , namely planarity @xmath38 and filamentarity @xmath39 defined as follows : = b - t ;   f = l - b .",
    "these are defined so that for an ideal sheet like object , @xmath38 = 1 , @xmath39 = 0 , whereas for an ideal one - dimensional filament , @xmath38 = 0 , @xmath39 = 1 cdm universe is the most filamentary , also consistent with its visual impression",
    ". further the more massive superclusters were shown to be more filamentary and the smaller structures were found to be quasi - spherical with @xmath400 .",
    "these results prove the robustness of shapefinders and confirm that the shapefinders do indeed provide crucial insight into the morphology of the lss , thus fulfilling the purpose for which these were devised.]@xmath41 .    in our present analysis ,",
    "we use the 2d version of the shapefinders , the shapefinder measure @xmath39 = ( p^2 - 16s ) ( p-4)^2 , originally defined in bharadwaj et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , to quantify the shape of the superclusters in the quasi-2d slices of the lcrs . by definition 0@xmath42 1 .",
    "@xmath39 quantifies the degree of filamentarity of a cluster , with @xmath39 = 1 indicating a filament and @xmath39 = 0 , a square ( while dealing with a density field defined on a grid ) .",
    "the average filamentarity ( @xmath43 ) , is defined as the mean filamentarity of all the clusters weighted by the square of the area of the clusters . _ 2 = _",
    "i=1^n_cl s_i^2 f_i _ i=1^n_cls_i^2 in the current analysis , we use the average filamentarity to quantify the degree of filamentarity in each of the lcrs slices .",
    "the galaxy distribution in the lcrs slices is quite sparse and therefore the filling factor @xmath44 ( defined as the fraction of filled cells ) is very small ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "the clusters identified using fof contain at most 2 or 3 filled cells , not yet corresponding to the long filaments visually apparent in the slices .",
    "larger structures are identified by the method of `` coarse - graining '' .",
    "coarse - graining is implemented by successively filling cells that are immediate neighbors of already filled cells .",
    "it may be noted that the `` coarse - graining '' procedure adopted by us is equivalent to smoothing successively with a top - hat kernel .",
    "the filled cells get fatter after every iteration of coarse - graining .",
    "this causes clusters to grow , first because of the growth of filled cells , and then by the merger of adjacent clusters as they overlap .",
    "the observed large scale patterns are initially enhanced as the clusters grow and then washed away as the clusters become very thick and fill up the entire region .",
    "@xmath44 increases from @xmath46 0.01 to @xmath47 1 as the coarse graining proceeds .",
    "so as not to limit ourselves to an arbitrarily chosen value of @xmath44 as the one defining filaments , we present our results showing the average filamentarity for the entire range of filling factor @xmath44 .",
    "now we describe how the shuffle algorithm works ( figure 2 ) .",
    "a grid with squares of side @xmath13 is superposed on the original data slice .",
    "square blocks of data which lie entirely within the slice are then randomly interchanged , with rotation , repeatedly , to form a new shuffled slice .",
    "this process eliminates features in the original data on scales longer than @xmath13 , keeping clustering at scales below @xmath13 nearly identical to the original data .",
    "all the structures spanning length - scales greater than @xmath13 that exist in the shuffled slices are the result of chance alignments . for each value of @xmath13 we use different realizations of the shuffled slices to estimate the degree of filamentarity that arises from chance alignments on scales larger than @xmath13 .",
    "the shuffled slices were analyzed in exactly the same way as the actual lcrs slices .",
    "at a fixed value of @xmath13 , the average filamentarity in the _ original _ sample will be larger than in the _ shuffled _ data only if the actual data have more filaments spanning length - scales larger than @xmath13 , than that expected from chance alignments .",
    "we vary the value of @xmath13 from @xmath48mpc to @xmath12mpc and determine the largest value of @xmath13 ( @xmath49 ) such that for all @xmath50 the values of the average filamentarity , @xmath43 , in the actual data are higher than the shuffled data , indicating the presence of physical filaments of lengths greater than @xmath13 .",
    "we use three realizations for @xmath51 and @xmath12mpc shuffling of slices , and six realizations for the intermediate length - scales . for length - scales beyond @xmath49",
    "the average filamentarity in the shuffled slices should continue to be the same as in the actual lcrs slice , establishing @xmath49 to be the largest length - scale across which we have statistically significant filamentarity .",
    "filaments which extend across length scales larger than @xmath49 are not statistically significant and are a consequence of chance alignments . in figure 3 , we plot average filamentarity , @xmath43 , as a function of the filling factor , @xmath44 , for both the original sample as well as for samples generated by shuffling the patches for various values of @xmath13 .",
    "to convey the essential aspects of the analysis , we only show the results for the slices shuffled at our lowest @xmath13 value , @xmath52mpc and at or near the length - scale of interest , @xmath49 .",
    "we use the @xmath53 test to establish @xmath49 for the six individual slices .",
    "the reduced @xmath53 for the curves in figure 3 are defined by ^2(l ) = 1 n_b-1_i=1^n_b[f_2^(i),lcrs - f_2^(i),shuffled(l)_f_2^(i)(l)]^2 , where @xmath54 is the number of data points available for comparison between the original slice and a shuffled slice for a value of @xmath13 .",
    "the quantity @xmath55 is the standard deviation in @xmath43 measured at a given filling factor , @xmath56 , using all the available shuffled realizations at a given length scale @xmath13 .",
    "we have noted that for filling factor , @xmath57 , all the @xmath43 curves follow the same trend , regardless of the slice ( original or shuffled ) .",
    "this can be interpreted as the regime of @xmath44 in which the coarse - graining defines structures of such large extent that they are unphysical and shuffling does not discriminate between original or shuffled data . including the tiny differences in the curves in this regime ( @xmath57 ) ,",
    "will give weight to an unphysical signal and determine an erroneous @xmath53 .",
    "hence , we only include the region of the curves for @xmath58 to determine the reduced @xmath53 , using this as the discriminating measure between the curve for the real data and the shuffled realizations at different @xmath13 .",
    "the reduced @xmath53 quantifies how different a shuffled slice is from the original , at various @xmath13 .",
    "the minimum value of the reduced @xmath53 should correspond to the length - scale @xmath59 at which , if slices are shuffled , the filamentarity of the shuffled slices and the original slice differ the least .",
    "this gives us the length scale @xmath49 beyond which filaments are only chance objects and not physical .    in figure 4 ,",
    "we show the reduced @xmath53 vs. @xmath13 plotted for the six slices . we also list the minimum values of reduced @xmath53 for each slice and the corresponding @xmath13 .",
    "we see that the values of reduced @xmath53 are well within acceptable bounds to say that the shuffled slices at these values of @xmath13 are indistinguishable from the original slice .",
    "the length - scale that correspond to these minima is @xmath60mpc for all the southern slices , whereas it is @xmath61mpc for @xmath16 slice and @xmath1mpc for @xmath2 and @xmath17 slices .",
    "we thus establish that for the southern slices the longest real filaments are no longer than @xmath62mpc and for the northern slices no longer than @xmath1mpc .",
    "beyond @xmath63mpc structure is not statistically significant .",
    "a look at the filamentary features at different levels of coarse - graining ( figure 1 ) reveals that the size of the largest filamentary feature increases monotonically with successive iterations of coarse - graining until it spans the entire survey ( bharadwaj et al .",
    "2000 ) . as coarse - graining proceeds , individual filaments form and then interconnect to form the supercluster - void network , in keeping with the earlier analysis ( einasto et al .",
    "1984 ; shandarin & yess 2000 ; einasto et al .",
    "2003a ) discussed in the introduction .",
    "although , the length of the interconnected network of filaments increases monotonically , the ratio of the length to the number of holes ( genus ) stabilizes and then decreases ( bharadwaj et al .",
    "2000 ) . for the @xmath64 slice ,",
    "this ratio stabilizes around @xmath65mpc at @xmath66 0.4 .",
    "this ratio may be interpreted as the perimeter of the typical void in the network .",
    "this leads to a picture where there are voids of diameter @xmath62mpc encircled by filaments of thickness @xmath48mpc ( peebles 1993 , sheth et al .",
    "2003 , sheth 2003 ) interconnected to form a large web .",
    "a void of this size , along with the filament at its perimeter , would span a length - scale @xmath67mpc .",
    "the results of this paper show that such voids encircled by filaments are statistically significant features .",
    "although our analysis also finds a web of interconnected filaments which spans length - scales larger than @xmath1mpc and runs across the entire survey , this is not statistically significant .",
    "the web arises from chance interconnections between the filaments encircling different voids .",
    "studies of the distribution of abell superclusters ( einasto et al .",
    "1997b ) show that the mean distance between neighboring superclusters is about @xmath3mpc for poor superclusters and about @xmath12mpc for rich superclusters .",
    "the distribution of the sdss superclusters ( einasto et al .",
    "2003a ) and the lcrs superclusters ( einasto et al .",
    "2003b ) shows a similar behavior . visualizing the superclusters as being randomly distributed",
    ", we would expect filaments joining the superclusters to develop as the density field is progressively smoothened .",
    "such filaments will arise from the chance alignments of shorter , genuine , statistically significant filaments .",
    "the filaments joining superclusters will span length - scales comparable to the mean inter - supercluster separation and the statistical properties of filaments would be stable to shuffling _",
    "i.e. _ , it would not change if the superclusters were rearranged randomly .",
    "our results may be interpreted as being indicative of the superclusters being randomly distributed on scales larger than @xmath1mpc with the mean inter supercluster separation also being of this order .",
    "the presence of statistically significant features on scales as large as @xmath0 to @xmath1mpc may seem surprising given the fact that the correlation analysis fails to detect any clustering on scales beyond @xmath68 to @xmath69mpc .",
    "this is due to the inability of the two point ( and higher order ) correlation functions in detecting coherence at large - scales . pattern specific methods ( like shapefinders ) are necessary to detect and quantify coherent large scale features in the galaxy distribution .",
    "it is interesting to note that the two dimensional power spectrum for the lcrs ( landy et al .",
    "1996 ) exhibits strong excess power at wavelengths @xmath70mpc , a feature which may possibly be related to the filamentary patterns studied here .",
    "the analysis of the three dimensional distribution of abell clusters ( einasto et al .",
    "1997a , 1997b ) reveals a bump at @xmath71 in the power spectrum . also , the recent analysis of the sdss shows a bump at @xmath72 in the power spectrum ( tegmark et al . 2003 ) .",
    "while it is interesting to conjecture that these features may be related to the presence of filaments , we should also note that the filaments are non - gaussian features and can not be characterized by the power spectrum alone .",
    "a point which should be noted is that the filaments quite often run in a zig - zag fashion ( figure 1 ) , and the length of a filament which spans a length - scale of @xmath1mpc may be significantly larger than @xmath1mpc .",
    "also , the present analysis is two dimensional whereas the filaments actually extend in all three dimensions . the length of the filaments may be somewhat larger in three dimensions , and a little bit of caution may be advocated in generalizing our results cdm model , sheth ( 2003 ) finds the length - scales of the largest superclusters to be @xmath73mpc .",
    "this indicates as to what might be anticipated in extending this work to 3d redshift surveys . ] .    in the gravitational instability picture , small disturbances in an initially uniform matter distribution",
    "grow to produce the large - scale structures presently observed in the universe .",
    "it is possible to interpret the filaments in terms of the coherence of the deformation ( or strain ) tensor ( bond , kofman & pogosyan 1996 ) of the smoothened map from the initial to the present positions of the particles which constitutes the matter .",
    "our analysis shows that the deformation tensor has correlation to length - scales up to @xmath1mpc and is uncorrelated on scales larger than this . the ability to produce statistically significant filamentarity on scales up to @xmath63mpc will be a crucial quantitative test of the different models for the formation of large scale structure in the universe .",
    "we next address the question of the length - scale beyond which the distribution of galaxies in the lcrs may be considered to be homogeneous .",
    "the analysis of kurokawa , morikawa & mouri ( 2001 ) shows this to occur at a length - scale of @xmath74 , whereas best ( 2000 ) fails to find a transition to homogeneity even on the largest scale analyzed .",
    "the analysis of amendola & palladino ( 1999 ) shows a fractal behavior on scales less than @xmath75 @xmath76 but is inconclusive about the transition to homogeneity .",
    "the results presented in this paper set a lower limit to this length - scale at around @xmath1mpc , in keeping with estimates based on the multi - fractal analysis of lcrs ( bharadwaj , gupta & seshadri 1999 ) who find that the lcrs exhibits homogeneity on the scales @xmath77 to @xmath78 . in a separate approach based on the analysis of the two point correlation applied to actual data and simulations einasto and gramann ( 1993 ) find that the transition to homogeneity occurs at about @xmath79 .",
    "for the lcrs , the scale of the largest coherent structure is at least twice the length - scale at which the two - point correlation function becomes zero . beyond this scale",
    "the filaments interconnect statistically to form a percolating network .",
    "this filament - void network of galaxies is not distinguishable , in a statistical sense , beyond scales of @xmath1mpc .",
    "if the lcrs slices can be considered a fair sample of the universe then this suggests the scale of homogeneity for the universe .",

    "<S> the largest length - scale at which filaments are statistically significant , real objects , is between @xmath0 to @xmath1mpc , for the lcrs @xmath2 slice . </S>",
    "<S> filamentary features longer than @xmath1mpc , though identified , are not statistically significant ; they arise from chance alignments . for the five other lcrs slices , filaments of lengths @xmath3mpc to @xmath4mpc </S>",
    "<S> are statistically significant , but not beyond . </S>",
    "<S> these results indicate that while individual filaments up to @xmath5mpc are statistically significant , the impression of structure on larger scales is a visual effect . on scales larger than @xmath1mpc the filaments interconnect by statistical chance to form the the filament - void network . </S>",
    "<S> the reality of the @xmath5mpc features in the @xmath2 slice make them the longest coherent features in the lcrs . </S>",
    "<S> while filaments are a natural outcome of gravitational instability , any numerical model attempting to describe the formation of large scale structure in the universe must produce coherent structures on scales that match these observations . </S>"
