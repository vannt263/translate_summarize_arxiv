    "dynamical studies in low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs hereafter ) offer a promissing route to test the equation of state of nuclear matter .",
    "soft equations of state are not stable above 1.6 m@xmath6 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and hence finding a neutron star more massive than this limit would be a major advance in our knowledge of nuclear matter physics .",
    "lmxbs and , in particular , accreting millisecond pulsars ( amps ) are expected to harbour the most massive neutron stars because of the sustained accretion of matter during their long lifes @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , dynamical studies are hampered by ( 1 ) the overwhelming accretion luminosity in persistent lmxbs ( which swamps the donor star s spectrum ) and ( 2 ) the extreme faintness of the companion star in transient amps during quiescence @xcite .",
    "a promissing route to overcome these limitations was proposed by @xcite .",
    "x - ray irradiated donor stars can be betrayed by the detection of high excitation fluorescence niii and ciii lines within the bowen blend at @xmath94634 - 50  .",
    "the doppler shift of these narrow lines traces the orbit of the donor star and , therefore , can yield dynamical constraints in persistent lmxbs and transient amps during outburst . as a result of this strategy",
    "some good candidates for massive neutron stars have been found , namely x1822 - 371 @xcite and aql x-1 @xcite .    in a few long period ( @xmath10 1 day ) systems ,",
    "the donor is an evolved star which can be spectroscopically detected over the irradiated accretion disc .",
    "cyg x-2 represents one of this exceptional cases .",
    "its first orbital solution was presented by @xcite who show that the donor star is an a5-f2 iii orbiting the neutron star in 9.843 days with a projected velocity @xmath11 km s@xmath2 .",
    "almost 20 years later , this was refined by @xcite ( c98 ) who find an a9 donor with orbital parameters @xmath12 d and @xmath13 km s@xmath2 .",
    "this work also reports the first determination of the rotational broadening of the donor s absorption features ( @xmath14 km s@xmath2 ) which , in turn , implies a binary mass ratio @xmath15 .",
    "this value is remarkable as it implies a peculiar donor star , very undermassive for its spectral type and the probable outcome of an intermediate mass binary @xcite .",
    "but the implications for the compact object s mass are also remarkable . the orbital solution , combined with inclination constraints @xmath16 derived through ellipsoidal fits to ubv light curves gives a neutron star mass of 1.78 @xmath17 0.23 m@xmath6 @xcite and , hence , a good candidate for a massive neutron star .",
    "this result has been recently challenged by @xcite ( e09 ) who measure @xmath18 km s@xmath2 and hence @xmath19=1.5 @xmath17 0.3 m@xmath6 .",
    "here we present new high resolution spectroscopic observations of cyg x-2 with the main aim of refining the rotational broadening of the donor star and update the orbital parameters .",
    "in contrast with e09 , we find a good agreement with previous results reported in c98 which give support to the presence of a massive neutron star in cyg x-2 .",
    "cyg x-2 was observed on the nights of 25 - 26 july 1999 using the utrech echelle spectrograph ( ues ) attached to the 4.2  m william herschel telescope ( wht ) at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos .",
    "ten 1800 - 3600s spectra were obtained with the e31 echelle grating and 2kx2k site1 detector , covering the spectral range @xmath205300 - 9000  .",
    "we selected a 1 \" slit and a factor 2 binning in the spectral direction , resulting in 10 km s@xmath2 resolution .",
    "thar arc images were observed each night for the purpose of wavelength calibration .",
    "the final wavelength calibration was verified using the oi skylines at @xmath215577.34 and @xmath216300.304 and variable velocity offsets were found between 0.2 - 5 km s@xmath2 .",
    "these were corrected from every individual spectrum .",
    "eleven additional spectra were obtained on the nights of 31 july 1999 and 9 july 2000 with the isis double - arm spectrograph on the wht .",
    "here we employed the 1200b grating on the blue arm and different central wavelengths resulting in wavelength coverages within @xmath203550 - 6665 .",
    "a 1 \" slit was selected yielding spectral resolutions in the range 34 - 54 km s@xmath2 .",
    "frequent comparison cuar+cune arc lamp images were taken every night for wavelength calibration .",
    "this was tested against sky lines and it was found to be accurate to within 4 km s@xmath2 .",
    "these small offsets were nevertheless corrected from the individual spectra .",
    "the isis red arm was always centered redwards of 7600    but is not used in this paper due to its lower spectral resolution and the paucity of absorption lines , which result in larger errors in the cross - correlation analysis .",
    "the red arm spectra were mainly taken for the sake of abundance analysis and will be reported elsewhere ( gonzlez hernndez et al .",
    "a log of the observations is presented in table [ tabobs ] .    for the purpose of radial velocity analysis",
    "we observed the stellar template hr 114 ( a7 iii ) using all different instrumental configurations .",
    "this star has an intrinsic @xmath22 of 21 km s@xmath2 i.e. comparable to the rotational broadening of the donor star in cyg x-2 ( c98 ) .",
    "therefore , to refine our previous rotational broadening we decided also to observe the f3 v star hr 6189 with ues , which has a reported upper limit @xmath23 km s@xmath2 .",
    "all the images were processed following standard debiasing and flat - fielding , and the spectra subsequently extracted using conventional optimal extraction techniques in order to optimize the signal - to - noise ratio of the output @xcite .",
    "in c98 we measured the rotational broadening of the donor star s features in cyg x-2 using 25 km s@xmath2 resolution spectra and found @xmath24 km s@xmath2 . here",
    "we revisit this determination using the 10 km s@xmath2 ues spectra .",
    "we broadened the template star hr 6189 from 5 to 50 km s@xmath2 in steps of 1 km s@xmath2 , using a gray profile @xcite and a limb - darkening coefficient @xmath25 appropriate for our spectral type and wavelength range .",
    "the broadened templates were rectified to the continuum ( usig a low - order spline fit ) and multiplied by factors @xmath26 , to account for their fractional contribution to the total light .",
    "these were subsequently subtracted from the doppler corrected average of cyg x-2 , obtained using the orbital solution given in sec .",
    "the cyg x-2 average was also rectified through fitting a low order spline to the continuum , after masking out the main emission and atmospheric / is absorption lines .",
    "the optimal broadening , based on a @xmath27 test on the residuals , is found for @xmath28 km s@xmath2 .",
    "a potential source of systematics is the assumption of continuum limb - darkening coefficient in the computation of the rotational profile .",
    "absorption lines in late - type stars are expected to have smaller core limb - darkening coefficients than the continuum @xcite and , therefore , assuming the continuum limb - darkening coefficient could bias the result .",
    "this was tested by repeating the same analysis using zero limb - darkening as a conservative lower limit and obtain @xmath29 km s@xmath2 .",
    "therefore , we decide to adopt the mean of the two limb - darkening values as a safe estimate of the true rotational broadening in cyg x-2 i.e. @xmath3 km s@xmath2 .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with our determination in c98 .",
    "we rectified the 21 individual spectra by subtracting a low - order spline fit to the continuum , after masking out the main emission and absorption features .",
    "the ues spectra were subsequently rebinned into a uniform velocity scale of 5 km s@xmath2 pix@xmath2 and the isis spectra into 27 km s@xmath2 pix@xmath2 .",
    "radial velocities were extracted through cross - correlation of every individual spectrum of cyg x-2 with its corresponding a7iii template hr 114 , observed with identical instrumental setup .",
    "the template spectra were previously broadened to 33 km s@xmath2 to match the width of the donor photospheric lines ( see previous section ) .",
    "cross - correlation was performed in the spectral regions free from emission and telluric absorption features . for consistency ,",
    "new radial velocities were extracted from the old database ( c98 ) using a contemporaneous observation of the same template hr 114 , obtained for the purpose of spectral classification .",
    "radial velocities were extracted following the method of @xcite , where parabolic fits were performed to the peak of the cross - correlation functions , and the uncertainties are purely statistical .",
    "the final errorbars were multiplied by a factor 2 so that the minimum reduced @xmath27 of a sinewave fit model is 1.0 .",
    "this yields the following parameters    @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33    where @xmath34 corresponds to the inferior conjunction of the donor star .",
    "all quoted errors are 68 per cent confidence . the systemic velocity @xmath35 has been corrected from the radial velocity of hr 114 , that we take as -10.2 @xmath170.9 km s@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "[ figrv ] displays the radial velocity points folded on the orbital period together with the best sine fit solution .",
    "new radial velocities are marked with open circles whereas solid circles indicate velocities from the old 1993 - 1997 database ( c98 ) .",
    "our @xmath8 velocity is consistent with c98 within 1-@xmath36 but not with e09 who finds @xmath37 .",
    "to ilustrate this point we also plot in dashed - line style the best sinewave fit for @xmath38 km s@xmath2 .",
    "this has @xmath39 for 60 degrees of freedom and hence it is far less significant than our @xmath8 value @xcite .",
    "e09 have suggested that the difference between the two @xmath8 values could be caused by different levels of x - ray irradiation between the two observing epochs .",
    "the detection of heii @xmath214686 emission from the companion by e09 certainly indicates that the star is irradiated .",
    "however , it remains to be seen whether irradiation is sufficient , not only to pump chromospheric heii emission , but also to modify the surface distribution of the photospheric absorption lines . in principle",
    ", irradiation can quench absorption lines from the inner hemisphere of the donor star , leading to an increase in the observed @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "it might be possible that , by a chance coincidence , the e09 database was obtained during an episode of lower x - ray activity than our data and we have looked for this using rxte / asm ( all sky monitor ) data .",
    "contemporaneous x - ray observations are available for the second half of the c98 campaign ( since 1996 , when rxte was launched ) our new data from 1999 - 2000 and the entire e09 database but comparable levels of x - ray activity are found , with the x - ray flux @xmath40 oscillating between 35 and 50 asm counts s@xmath2 .",
    "only one velocity point in c98 , obtained on the night of 5 aug 1996 , was taken during a dip in the x - ray light curve of @xmath918 counts s@xmath2 .",
    "interestingly , its orbital phase is @xmath41 , almost identical to that of another point obtained on 3 aug 1997 ( @xmath42 ) , when @xmath43 50 counts s@xmath2 i.e. almost a factor 3 higher . despite the difference in x - ray flux both velocities are consistent with our best orbital solution within 1@xmath44 .",
    "and one should note that phase 0.65 is close to an orbital quadrature , when velocity distortions from a circular orbit should be largest ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this strongly suggests that the effects of x - ray irradiation in the radial velocity curve are unimportant .    as a matter of fact",
    ", irradiation will distort the radial velocity curve from a simple sine wave , introducing a fictitious eccentricity which should be measurable .",
    "therefore , we have also attempted to fit elliptical orbits to our database , following @xcite .",
    "our best fit yields null eccentricity ( @xmath45 ) and a larger reduced @xmath46 than a simple circular solution , another indication that irradiation is negligible at this level .",
    "furthermore , @xcite find no evidence for excess light at phase 0.5 in their optical light curves nor c98 observe any significant change of spectral type with orbital phase .",
    "these two results also suggest that x - ray irradiation is not enough to explain the discrepant @xmath8 values .",
    "the lack of irradiation signatures is probably due to the fact that the donor star is hot and the orbital separation large @xcite .",
    "the x - ray flux received by every surface element on the companion star is too small to produce any disturbance in the radial velocity curve or light curve , despite the near eddington x - ray luminosity of cyg x-2 .",
    "looking at the radial velocity curve of e09 ( shown in fig .",
    "4 ) we note a large scatter in the velocity points near the phase 0.25 quadrature .",
    "two datapoints seem to lie systematically lower than the rest by @xmath4720 km s@xmath2 and this is certaintly dragging the @xmath8 velocity to lower values .",
    "the authors admit that only one arc spectrum was obtained for most of the nights .",
    "although sky lines were used to correct for instrumental offsets , the fact that the strongest sky line oiii @xmath215577 lies at the edge of their spectral range may introduce some systematics in the offset correction .",
    "therefore , we believe that the value reported by e09 might be affected by problems with the wavelength calibration which is a critical issue given their low spectral resolution of @xmath47160 km s@xmath2 . in any case , new high resolution observations obtained at the two orbital quadratures are clearly required to further constrain @xmath8 and confirm our result .",
    "since the donor star is filling its roche lobe and synchronized , we can combine our updated @xmath8 and @xmath22 values to constrain the binary mass ratio through    @xmath48    @xcite which leads to @xmath49 .",
    "the revised mass function is thus @xmath50 and hence @xmath51 m@xmath6 .",
    "assuming @xmath52 @xcite we find @xmath53 m@xmath6 .",
    "the error budget is clearly dominated by the uncertainty in the inclination angle and thus ellipsoidal model fits to new light curves are urgently needed to better constraint the stellar masses .",
    "we have revisited the determination of the system parameters in cyg x-2 with 21 new high - resolution spectra obtained during 1999 and 2000 .",
    "the new solution does not support the conclusions of e09 who claim for a significantly lower value for the radial velocity semiamplitude of the donor star . instead",
    ", our results confirm previous determinations reported in c98 .",
    "the discrepancy can not be explained by x - ray irradiation because the sinusoidal shape of the radial velocity curve is not disturbed . in particular ,",
    "we find ( i ) no evidence for orbital eccentricity and ( ii ) no significant deviations between two velocity points at phase @xmath47 0.65 , when x - ray flux varies by a factor @xmath473 .",
    "our refined orbital parameters are @xmath54 days , @xmath55 km s@xmath2 and @xmath56 km s@xmath2 , which lead to @xmath49 , @xmath51 m@xmath6 .",
    "assuming @xmath7 from @xcite leads to @xmath5 m@xmath6 and , therefore , the possibility that cyg x-2 harbours a neutron star more massive than canonical .",
