    "recent studies of quantum integrable dynamical models and spin chains with long - range interactions  @xcite have not only enriched our understanding of strongly correlated many - particle systems in one dimension , but also influenced several branches of mathematics in a significant way .",
    "in particular , it is found that this class of quantum integrable systems have close connections with apparently diverse subjects like generalized exclusion statistics  @xcite , quantum hall effect  @xcite , quantum electric transport in mesoscopic systems  @xcite , random matrix theory  @xcite , multivariate orthogonal polynomials  @xcite and yangian quantum groups  @xcite .",
    "the interest in quantum integrable models with long - range interaction was initiated by a seminal work of calogero  @xcite , where the exact spectrum of an @xmath2-particle system on a line with two - body interactions inversely proportional to the square of their distances and subject to a confining harmonic potential was computed in closed form",
    ". an exactly solvable trigonometric variant of the rational model introduced by calogero was proposed shortly afterwards by sutherland  @xcite .",
    "the particles in this so - called sutherland model move on a circle , with two - body interactions proportional to the inverse square of their chord distances .",
    "subsequently , olshanetsky and perelomov established the existence of an underlying @xmath3 root system structure for both the calogero and sutherland models , and constructed generalizations thereof associated with other classical ( extended ) root systems like @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6  @xcite .    in a parallel development , haldane and shastry found an exactly solvable quantum spin-@xmath7 chain with long - range interactions , whose ground state coincides with the @xmath8 limit of gutzwiller s variational wave function for the hubbard model , and provides a one - dimensional realization of the resonating valence bond state  @xcite .",
    "the lattice sites of this su@xmath9 haldane  shastry ( hs ) spin chain are equally spaced on a circle , all spins interacting with each other through pairwise exchange interactions inversely proportional to the square of their chord distances . a close relation between the hs chain and the su(@xmath1 ) spin generalization of the original ( @xmath3-type ) sutherland model  @xcite , which leads to many quantitative predictions ,",
    "was subsequently established through the so - called `` freezing trick ''  @xcite .",
    "more precisely , it is found that in the strong coupling limit the particles in the spin sutherland model `` freeze '' at the coordinates of the equilibrium position of the scalar part of the potential , and the dynamical and spin degrees of freedom decouple .",
    "the equilibrium coordinates coincide with the equally spaced lattice points of the hs spin chain , so that the decoupled spin degrees of freedom are governed by the hamiltonian of the su(@xmath1 ) hs model .",
    "moreover , in this freezing limit the conserved quantities of the spin sutherland model immediately yield those of the hs spin chain , thereby explaining its complete integrability . by applying the freezing trick to the @xmath3-type rational calogero model with spin degrees of freedom ,",
    "a new integrable spin chain with long - range interaction was constructed in ref .",
    "the sites of this chain commonly known in the literature as the polychronakos or polychronakos  frahm ( pf ) spin chain are unequally spaced on a line , and in fact coincide with the zeros of the @xmath2-th hermite polynomial  @xcite .",
    "the powerful technique of the freezing trick was subsequently used to compute the exact partition functions of both the su(@xmath1 ) pf spin chain  @xcite and the su(@xmath1 ) hs chain  @xcite , the @xmath6 counterparts of these chains  @xcite , and their supersymmetric extensions  @xcite",
    ". the exact computation of the partition functions of these quantum integrable spin chains has opened up the exciting possibility of studying various statistical properties of their energy spectra .",
    "indeed , it is found that for a large number of lattice sites the energy level density of such chains follows the gaussian distribution with a high degree of accuracy  @xcite .",
    "it has also been observed that the distribution of the ( normalized ) spacings between consecutive energy levels of these chains is not of poisson type , as might be expected in view of a well - known conjecture of berry and tabor  @xcite .",
    "an analytical expression , which explains the unexpected distribution of spacings between consecutive energy levels in the above mentioned chains , has recently been derived using only a few simple properties of their spectra  @xcite .    our aim in this article is first of all to analyze the spectra of the su(@xmath1 ) spin calogero model of @xmath0 type .",
    "we shall then apply the freezing trick to compute the exact partition function of the @xmath0 version of the pf spin chain , and use this partition function to study various statistical properties of the chain s spectrum .",
    "it should be stressed that , although the hamiltonian of the @xmath0-type su(@xmath1 ) spin calogero model can be obtained by setting to zero one of the coupling constants of their @xmath6 counterparts , this fact does not allow one to find out all physically relevant properties of the @xmath0 model as a limiting case of its @xmath6 version .",
    "for example , as will be explained in section  [ themodel ] , the configuration space of the @xmath0-type spin calogero model differs quite significantly from its @xmath6 counterpart .",
    "a more drastic change occurs in the hilbert space of the @xmath0 model , which gets `` doubled '' in comparison with the @xmath6 one .",
    "more precisely , the hilbert space of the @xmath0 spin calogero model can be expressed as a direct sum of the hilbert spaces associated to two different @xmath6 models with opposite `` chiralities '' .",
    "these remarkable properties of the @xmath0 model indicate that it is a `` singular limit '' of the corresponding @xmath6 model , worthy of consideration in its own right .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ themodel ]",
    "we introduce the su(@xmath1 ) spin calogero model of @xmath0 type and construct its associated ( antiferromagnetic ) spin chain by means of the freezing trick , discussing their relation with their @xmath6 counterparts .",
    "section  [ specpf ] is devoted to the evaluation of the spectrum of the spin calogero model of @xmath0 type , which is then used to compute in closed form the partition function of its associated spin chain applying the freezing trick .",
    "we also show how to express this partition function in terms of those of the pf chains of type @xmath10 and @xmath11 . in section  [ stat ]",
    "we make use of the closed - form expressions for the partition function of the pf chain of @xmath0 type to analyze several statistical properties of its spectrum .",
    "we show that as is the case with other chains of hs type the level density follows with great accuracy the gaussian law when the number of lattice sites is sufficiently large .",
    "we also prove that the cumulative distribution of spacings between consecutive levels follows the same `` square root of a logarithm '' law obeyed by the pf chain of types a and b and by the original hs chain .",
    "this provides further confirmation of the fact that spin chains of hs type are exceptional integrable systems from the point of view of the berry  tabor conjecture .",
    "finally , in section  [ ferro ] we outline the generalization of the above results to the ferromagnetic chain and its associated spin dynamical model .",
    "since the su(@xmath1 ) spin calogero model of @xmath0 type is closely related to its @xmath6 counterpart , we shall start by briefly reviewing the latter model , whose hamiltonian is given by  @xcite @xmath12 \\notag\\\\ & { } + b \\sum_i",

    "@xmath153 , a partial ordering among these basis vectors may again be defined by the degree @xmath154 .",

    "since @xmath166 differs from the basis vector @xmath167 at most by a sign , and @xmath168 , our claim follows directly from eq .  .",
    "moreover , the latter equation and eq .   imply that the eigenvalues of the spin calogero hamiltonian   are given by @xmath169 where @xmath170 and @xmath171 satisfy conditions ( i)(iii ) above .",

    "explicit expressions for such degeneracy factors will be given shortly when computing the partition function of the model .",
    "it is important at this point to elucidate the connection between the hilbert spaces of the @xmath0-type spin calogero model and its @xmath6 counterpart .",
    "the key fact in this respect is that the @xmath0 hamiltonian   does not depend on the discrete parameter @xmath118 .",
    "consequently , as shown in eq .  , we can use both projectors @xmath178 and @xmath179 for constructing the hilbert space . on the other hand , since @xmath118 appears explicitly in the hamiltonian of the @xmath6 spin calogero model  , for any given value of @xmath118 only the corresponding projector @xmath138 can be used to construct the hilbert space  @xcite . moreover , when @xmath40 this hilbert space is essentially the subspace @xmath151 of @xmath155 in eq .  .",
