    "globular clusters constitute a relevant part of the halo of a galaxy , nevertheless they contain less than 1% of its mass .",
    "for example , in our galaxy the average mass of globulars is @xmath1 m@xmath2 , which means a total cluster mass of about @xmath3 m@xmath4 , whlle the spheroid mass is about @xmath5 m@xmath2 , it is known that globular clusters are among the oldest objects in galaxies , aging around @xmath6 gyr . in spite of the lack of direct determination of the age of bulge s stars , it is , nevertheless , commonly accepted for the halo field stars an age comparable to that of globulars , inferred also from their low metal content .",
    "a diffuse paradigma is that the two components of the galactic halo ( individual stars and globular clusters ) are _ almost co  eval _ , in the sense that the difference in the formation epoch was probably just a fraction of the protogalactic halo free  fall time , which is a relatively short time ( of the order of a twentieth of the clusters age ) .",
    "this paradigma is supported by the evidence of the similar space distribution of globular clusters and halo stars , even if these latter seem to be more centrally peaked than globulars .",
    "the question whether or not field stars and globular clusters are coeval is out of the purposes of this paper ; if we assume that it is logical to ask : how can the typical fragmenting mass change for 5 order of magnitudes in the short time interval that is required to allow both solar mass size objects and globular cluster to fill almost the same volume ( the halo ) ?    the use of the occam s razor make me think that the scientifically most _ economic _ point of view is that almost all the available gas fragmented during the proto  halo collapse into masses of just one typical size ( of either stellar _ or _",
    "globular cluster scale ) and later , shortly later , a merging or a sub  fragmentation lead to the other condensed phase .",
    "i do nt believe as very plausible the bottom  up picture ( stars formed earlier and partly merged to globulars ) ; much more physically viable is , instead , the idea that large clouds condensed first and released later part of their mass to the environment , which , consequently , is replenished of some material available to fragment furtherly on another scale .",
    "in recent years many theories of globular cluster formation have been presented in the literature .",
    "most of them are developments of a fall and rees ( 1985 ) idea .",
    "fall and rees semi ",
    "quantitatively supported the framework of cluster formation in a two  phase gaseous system : a hot ( @xmath7 k ) , dilute gas where clumps are present which are not able to cool below @xmath8 k. in this scheme spheroid stars formed earlier .",
    "it is interesting to note how various authors , starting from almost the same picture of fall and rees , reached very different , sometimes contradictory , conclusions .",
    "palla and zinnecker ( 1987 ) found , in a simplified picture , that non ",
    "equilibrium h2 cooling allows the clumps to cool down to about @xmath9 k , so that the jeans mass drops to stellar values within the clumps .",
    "even if this could explain star formation @xmath10 clumps , i.e. within protoglobular clusters , this does not explain the @xmath11 ( bulge ) star formation .",
    "ashman ( 1990 ) confirms the possibility for the gas to cool to @xmath9 k , but he found that dark clusters ( composed by jupiters ) are formed from low mass clouds as well as globular clusters from high mass clouds . some more detailed scheme and",
    "deeper calculations by murray and lin ( 1989 ) show that large amplitude perturbations allow cooling and pop .",
    "iii star formation , whose flux delays globular cluster formation .",
    "another , more recent , paper by vietri and pesce ( 1995 ) gave hints to the idea that imploding shocks may leave stars behind the front .",
    "to summarize , very different conclusions are drawn , and so the question of how globular clusters and spheroid stars have been formed is actually still open .    in this report",
    ", we prefer to start , rather than with the fall and rees two  phase gas , with the generally accepted scheme of a halo which is at its virial temperature , in the range @xmath0-@xmath7 k , so that the actual fragmenting mass , of the scale of the jeans mass , is much larger ( @xmath12 m@xmath4 ) than the typical globular cluster mass .",
    "these large gaseous clouds collapsed in a more or less violent way in dependence on how far from equilibrium they were .",
    "this collapse , with its implications on the cloud thermodynamics and thus on the equation of state of the gas , results in a violent or gentle bounce of the structure . in both cases",
    ", the existence of a tidal cut - off necessarily implies that part of the gas mass is lost through the tidal radius to the environment , on a time scale of the order of the cloud free - fall time .",
    "this way , the halo can be replenished with `` processed '' gas ( shocked or not ) , which is , in any case , likely in a quite different thermodynamical state than before .",
    "this would naturally give a diffuse halo at a density and temperature @xmath13 different from that in the original big clouds , meaning a @xmath13 different jeans mass .",
    "the role of the eos in the evolution of a self  gravitating gas cloud is important , due to the mutual feedback between dynamics and thermodynamics of the cloud .",
    "it is well known , indeed , that a _ soft _ eos induces a much more violent collapse than a _ harder _ eos in an unstable cloud .",
    "the writing of the eos in the usual form    @xmath14    ( where @xmath15 is the gas pressure , @xmath16 is the mass density and @xmath17 is the internal energy per unit mass ) corresponds to a definition of the adiabatic exponent @xmath18 as @xmath19 @xmath20 being the non  translational part of the internal energy .    of course , softer eoss correspond to situations where @xmath20 dominates the internal energy ( dissociations , ioniziations ) : in self  gravitating clouds this means that the work of gravitation during a collapse goes into breaking molecular and/or ionic links among components and not into the thermal motion which would help the structure to resist the collapse .",
    "it is quite possible to have clouds in condition of apparent equilibrium , in the sense that the gas appears almost virialized but the equilibrium is very unstable because the gas density and temperature are such that just a small compressional perturbation makes @xmath18 to decrease abruptly inducing the overall structure to fall under its own gravitation .",
    "a possible fate is that of a violent collapse , which induces high densities and temperature to be reached in the central regions , eventually hardening significantly the eos at a level that matter in the centre of the clouds becomes a sort of hard core against which the infalling outer layers splash and bounce back at supersonic speed , in form of shock waves which carry out of the system a non  negligible part of the initial mass of the cloud .",
    "= 10.0 cm    evolution of the average temperature , adiabatic exponent and ratio of the mass lost to the total for a @xmath21 m@xmath4 initially uniform cloud . left panels refer to a cloud with @xmath22 k ; right panels to @xmath23 k. time is in unit of free  fall time .",
    "this is what we call violent mass  loss from protoclouds .",
    "a careful investigation of such a phenomenon implies the development of very detailed and carefully controlled hydrodynamic models , for it is known how deep collapses of self  gravitating structures are very difficult to be numerically followed because , with acceptable time steps , computational error becomes exceedingly large so to make the further dynamical evolution absolutely unreliable .",
    "note that the numerical error of integration induces quite naturally a large error in the total energy , which explains why it is possible to have non - realistic explosions of the whole structure .",
    "an explanation of this can be given through the following simple example .",
    "it is easily seen that a model of cloud collapse represented by the equation    @xmath24    ( where @xmath25 is the second time derivative of the radius of the uniformly , @xmath26 , collapsing gaseous sphere , @xmath15 is the pressure at the boundary and @xmath27 the mass of the cloud ) leads to unavoidable infinite collapse when the adiabatic exponent @xmath18 in the eos is less than @xmath28 . of course",
    ", in real situations @xmath18 varies during the cloud evolution , and this has crucial consequences on the energetic balance .",
    "actually , the relative error in the total energy , @xmath29 , is contributed by a kinetic term which scales as @xmath30 , a gravitational term proportional to @xmath31 , and an internal  energy error term scaling as @xmath32 .",
    "the coefficient of @xmath31 in the gravitational error term is estimated to be greater than the kinetic one , so it is clear that @xmath33 makes the energy to explode @xmath34 as @xmath35 goes to zero , thus reverting the ( correct ) extreme collapse to an eventual explosion whenever the error in @xmath35 is not kept very well under control .",
    "actually , if the error in @xmath35 has grown too much , it happens that even if @xmath18 re - increases above the critical @xmath28 the energy may have definitely changed sign from negative to positive , implying unboundedness of the system through an eventual explosion , while the correct re - expansion , if any , would have been very different .",
    "the study of violent collapses , and their physical consequences , requires , so , a very careful attention .",
    "i postpone a deep discussion of this to future work , limiting here to the report of some results related to the much easier controlled _ quiescent _ mass loss .",
    "the quiescent mass loss is what expected when the gas cloud experiences a gentle contraction and re - expansion and part of the mass of the cloud escapes through the tidal radius .",
    "i have made some simulations of collapses of self  gravitating gas of primordial compositions , using our own sph code ( capuzzo dolcetta & di lisio , 1994 ) .",
    "of course the adiabatic exponent is allowed to vary , and its evolution is determined by the evolution of the chemical species constituting the gas :    @xmath36    i do nt go here into details of the models , it suffices to say that the time evolution of the chemical abundances is followed with a sophisticated implicit method which is able to reduce the error in their evaluation and their feedback on the overall evolution to a very low value .",
    "molecular and atomic cooling have been included in the energy equation .",
    "as an example of the results , the time evolution of some characteristic quantities is shown in figure 1 , for two spherical and initially uniform ( both in density and temperature ) gas clouds of same mass @xmath37 m@xmath4 and initial radius @xmath38 pc , but different initial virial ratios @xmath39 , namely @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 clouds ) .",
    "the clouds are supposed orbiting around the centre of the mother galaxy at a distance such that the tidal radius is initially @xmath44 pc .    in both the considered cases the collapse is deepest at about @xmath45 free - fall times , and the re  expansion leads to a loss of about @xmath46 of the total mass in a time shorter than @xmath47 ( @xmath48 myr ) .",
    "note that , whether the characteristic fragmenting mass from the virial gaseous halo has been of the order of @xmath21 m@xmath4 , a loss of @xmath49 m@xmath4 _ per _ cloud means that @xmath50 such clouds may have recycled a quantity of material of the order of the presently estimated bulge mass ( @xmath51 m@xmath4 ) .",
    "it has been shown how delicate is following the evolution of a self  gravitating zero  metal cloud in primordial conditions , due to the variation of the eos as consequence of dissociations and inonization of hydrogenic molecules and ions .    as preliminary result of a more extensive future work",
    ", i showed that the @xmath52 mass loss from protoclouds of the size or greater than the jeans mass in a virialized protohalo can provide a substantial fraction of the mass later condensed into stars of the spheroidal bulge .",
