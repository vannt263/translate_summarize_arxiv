    "the properties of @xmath0 meson , such as @xmath5 oscillation , the mass difference @xmath6 and the charge - parity violation and etc . , have been studied by cdf and d0 collaborations @xcite .",
    "especially , the cern lhc , with a high collision energy and a high luminosity , shall provide a good platform for studying the properties of @xmath0 meson @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we shall focus our attention on its hadronic production .",
    "principally , there are two approaches to deal with the heavy meson hadroproduction .",
    "one is the ` fragmentation approach ' , which is usually adaptable to higher transverse momentum region , e.g. refs.@xcite showed explicit examples for @xmath7 hadroproduction and @xmath8-meson hadroproduction respectively .",
    "the other one is the so - called ` complete calculation approach ' . due to the fact that all the phase - space point can be conveniently retained within the ` complete calculation approach ' , while the phase - space of the accompanied particles has been integrated out within the fragmentation approach so as to obtain the fragmentation function .",
    "then the advantage of the complete approach is clear , i.e. it can retain the information of the accompanied quark jets , which sometimes is experimentally useful .",
    "later on , we shall adopt the ` complete calculation approach ' for our discussions .    in the higher transverse momentum and smaller rapidity regions of a hadronic collider , which mainly corresponding to larger momentum fraction of the constitute quarks",
    ", it is found that the heavy quark components in proton or antiproton is always quite small in comparison to that of the light quarks or gluons .",
    "so in the literature , one usually does not take heavy quark components contributions into consideration in most of the calculations for the heavy quarkonium production .",
    "for the purpose , the fixed - flavor - number scheme ( ffns ) is usually adopted @xcite . within ffns , the number of the active flavors in the initial hadron is fixed to be @xmath9 , and then only light quarks / antiquarks and gluon should be considered in the initial state of the hard scattering subprocess .",
    "we have studied the hadronic production of the spin - singlet @xmath0 and the spin - triplet @xmath1 within the ` complete calculation approach ' by adopting ffns @xcite .",
    "however , it has been argued that in certain cases the heavy quark components in the collision hadrons may also provide sizable contributions .",
    "for example , it has been shown that the mechanisms involving heavy quarks in the initial state can give sizable contributions to the hadronic production of @xmath10-quarkonium @xcite , @xmath11-quarkonium @xcite , @xmath12-baryons @xcite , and etc .. especially , it is found that in the lower @xmath13 region , the mechanisms from those heavy quarks in the initial state ( hereafter refer to as  heavy quark mechanism \" ) can even dominant over other mechanisms .",
    "the heavy - flavored quarks can be generated in two different ways inside the incident hadrons : firstly , it can be perturbatively generated by gluon splitting , and hence is usually named as ` extrinsic ' component ; and secondly , it can also be generated non - perturbatively and appears at or even below the energy scale of heavy quark threshold that can be named as ` intrinsic ' one according to refs.@xcite . for the present case of @xmath4 production , the intrinsic @xmath14-quark component in the hadron is quite small @xcite , and it shall lead to negligible contribution for the production at both the hadronic colliders tevatron and lhc , so we shall not consider it at the present .",
    "while , as a comprehensive analysis of the hadronic production of @xmath4 , it would be interesting to study the extrinsic heavy quarks contributions , which might be sizable , and also to make a comparison of the results with those obtained from ffns .    for such purpose",
    ", one has to deal with the production of @xmath4 through the heavy quark mechanism and the gluon - gluon fusion mechanism simultaneously .",
    "this is not an easy task , since we has to solve the double counting problem @xcite : i.e. a full qcd evolved heavy quark distribution functions , according to the altarelli - parisi equations , includes all the terms proportional to @xmath15 ( @xmath16 stands for the factorization scale and @xmath17 is the heavy quark mass ) , while some of them also occur in the gluon - gluon fusion mechanism after doing the phase - space integration .",
    "we shall adopt the the general - mass variable - flavor - number scheme ( gm - vfns ) @xcite to deal with the double counting problem .",
    "it should be noted that our present main purpose is to deal with the double counting problem between the heavy quark mechanism and the gluon - gluon fusion mechanism , and a full nlo calculation of the process is not available at the present due to its complexity , so our present implementation of gm - vfns is similar to the aivazis - collins - olness - tung ( acot ) approach @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii , we present the calculation technology to estimate the @xmath4 hadroproduction under the gm - vfns . in sec.iii , we present our numerical results and a comparison of the hadronic production of @xmath4 meson from the ffns and the gm - vfns shall also be presented .",
    "the final section is reserved for a summary .",
    "according to pqcd factorization theorem , the cross - section for the hadronic production of @xmath4 under the gm - vfns can be formulated as    @xmath18 \\bigotimes d\\hat{\\sigma}_{g\\bar{b}\\rightarrow b^{(*)}_s}(x_{1},x_{2},\\mu)\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\cdots , \\label{basic}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the ellipsis stands for the terms in higher @xmath19 order and those terms with smaller contributions , such as the light quark and light anti - quark collision mechanism . the first term in eq.([basic ] )",
    "shows the gluon - gluon fusion mechanism , which is dominant one under the ffns .",
    "the second one represents the extrinsic @xmath14-quark mechanism , in which the subtraction term is introduced to eliminate the double counting problem .",
    "the function @xmath20 ( with @xmath21 or @xmath22 and @xmath23 or @xmath24 ) stands for the distribution function of parton @xmath25 in hadron @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 stands for the hadronic cross - section and @xmath28 stands for the corresponding subprocesses . as conventional treatment ,",
    "we have taken the renormalization scale @xmath29 for the subprocess and the factorization scale @xmath30 for factorizing the pdfs and the hard subprocess to be the same , i.e. @xmath31 . in the square brackets , the subtraction term for @xmath32",
    "is defined as @xmath33 where the quark distribution @xmath34 up to order @xmath19 is connected to the familiar @xmath35 splitting function @xmath36 , and its form can be written as @xmath37        as for the gluon - gluon fusion mechanism , we need to deal with 36 feynman diagrams at the leading order @xmath38 , which has been dealt with in ref.@xcite by using the improved helicity amplitude approach as described in detail in ref.@xcite . as for the extrinsic @xmath14-quark mechanism for the hadronic @xmath4 production , we need to consider the production via the subprocess @xmath39 , whose typical feynman diagrams for the extrinsic @xmath14-quark mechanism at the leading order ( lo ) are shown in fig.([feyn ] ) . in eq.([basic ] ) , @xmath40 stands for the usual 2-to-2 differential cross section ,    @xmath41    where the initial - parton spin and color average and the final - state quantum number summation are all attributed to @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath42 can be calculated by using the conventional way , only one needs to keep the heavy quark mass terms according to the gm - vfn scheme . for shortening the text ,",
    "we do not put @xmath42 here , whose explicit form can be found in the appendix of ref.@xcite by simply changing @xmath43 there to be the present case of @xmath44 .",
    "next , to accomplish the phase space integration , we adopt two routines rambos @xcite and vegas @xcite , which together with some reasonable transformations to make them run more effectively can be found in the generators bcvegpy @xcite and genxicc @xcite .",
    "gm - vfns is considered as the most complete framework for pqcd calculations being applicable in all regions of the phase space of hard processes . in particular ,",
    "such scheme is by now standard in global analysis of pdfs to extract the most precise sets of partons to be used for physics predictions at the lhc @xcite . according to gm - vfns ,",
    "there is double counting of the gluon - gluon fusion mechanism and the extrinsic @xmath14-quark mechanism . for the gluon - gluon fusion mechanism ,",
    "in some of its feynman diagrams , when the intermediate heavy quark line that is next to the incident gluon is nearly on shell and is collinear to the incident gluon , then it will result in a factor of order @xmath19 distribution of a quark in a gluon , like eq.([quark ] ) .",
    "while such factor has already been included in the heavy quark distribution function , so these feynman diagrams under such particular condition are double counted and must be subtracted .",
    "more explicitly , we draw fig.([graphical ] ) as an example to graphically illustrate this point , which is similar to the case of hadronic production of heavy quarks @xcite .",
    "the symbol @xmath45 on the internal quark line in the subtraction term means that the heavy quark is on mass - shell and moving longitudinally .",
    "it should be noted that our present purpose is to deal with the double counting problem between the heavy quark mechanism and the gluon - gluon fusion mechanism , and a full nlo calculation of the process is not available at the present , so our present implementation of gm - vfns is similar to the aivazis - collins - olness - tung ( acot ) approach @xcite , which sometimes is called as a lo generalized @xmath46 calculation @xcite .",
    "in doing the numerical calculation , we take the decay constant and the radial wave function at the origin to be @xmath47 and @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "the masses of @xmath14 and @xmath49 quarks are taken as @xmath50 and @xmath51 . and",
    "to ensure the gauge invariance of the hard scattering amplitude , the mass of the bound state is taken to be the sum of the two constitute quark masses , i.e. @xmath52 . the scale @xmath16 is set to be the transverse mass of the bound state , i.e. @xmath53 , where @xmath13 is the transverse momentum of the bound state . under the gm - vfn scheme ,",
    "cteq6hq @xcite is adopted for pdf , and to be consistent , the nlo @xmath19 running above @xmath54 gev is adopted , i.e. @xmath55}{\\ln(\\mu^2/\\lambda_{qcd}^2)}\\right]$ ] , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 . as a comparison , for the ffn scheme , the lo @xmath19 running is adopted .",
    "it is noted that for gm - vfns , the value of @xmath58 changes with the energy scale .",
    "firstly , it would be interesting to show how double counting term is subtracted in gm - vfns .",
    "we present the results of the extrinsic @xmath14-quark mechanism for the hadronic production of @xmath0 both at lhc and at tevatron in fig.([sub ] ) .",
    "it can be found that there exists a large cancelation between the contributions from the ` pure - pdf ' term ( with @xmath14-quark pdf taken to be cteq6hq ) and the subtraction term ( with @xmath14-quark pdf taken to be the subtraction term defined in eq.([subtraction ] ) ) , especially , in the large @xmath13 regions .",
    "this shows that to obtain a reliable results under the gm - vfns , we should take such double counting term into consideration , otherwise , the results maybe largely overestimated .",
    ".cross section ( in unit @xmath59 ) for the hadronic production of @xmath0 at lhc ( @xmath60 tev ) and tevatron ( @xmath61 tev ) under gm - vfns and ffns , where the symbol @xmath62 stands for the extrinsic @xmath14-quark mechanism and etc .",
    "two typical @xmath13 cuts are adopted . as for the rapidity cut , we take @xmath63 for lhc and @xmath64 for tevatron . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ mbptcutii ]    the uncertainties for the hadronic production of @xmath0 and @xmath1 include the pdfs , the quark masses , the factorization scale and etc .. we have made a detailed discuss on such uncertainties in ref.@xcite under ffns , here we shall only concentrate our attention on the @xmath14-quark mass effect on the hadronic production , since the other uncertainties shall give similar behavior under both gm - vfns and ffns . for the purpose of discussing the uncertainties caused by @xmath65 , we vary @xmath65 within the region of @xmath66 gev .",
    "the total cross section for the hadronic production of the scalar @xmath67 $ ] and the vector @xmath68 $ ] at lhc and tevatron under gm - vfns and ffns are presented in tab.[mbptcuti ] and tab.[mbptcutii ] . for definiteness and focussing the uncertainties from the @xmath14-quark mass alone , and we fix @xmath69 gev , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and the pdf is taken from cteq6hq and cteq6l for gm - vfns and ffns respectively .    from tab.[mbptcuti ] and tab.[mbptcutii ] , it is found that the total cross section for the extrinsic mechanism _ increases _ with the increment of @xmath65 . for clarity , in the following",
    ", we shall take the case of @xmath0 as an explicit examples to explain this point , and the case of @xmath72 is similar .",
    "when setting @xmath73 gev , the total cross section for @xmath0 shall be _ increased _ by @xmath74 when @xmath65 increased by @xmath75 gev at both lhc and tevatron , which reduces to be @xmath76 at lhc and @xmath77 at tevatron for @xmath78 gev .",
    "inversely , since the allowed phase space becomes narrower with the increment of @xmath65 , it is found that the total cross section for the gluon - gluon fusion mechanism _ decreases _ with the increment of @xmath65 .",
    "the total cross section of @xmath0 for the gluon - gluon fusion mechanism shall be _ decreased _ by @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) when @xmath65 increased by @xmath75 gev for @xmath81 gev at lhc ( at tevatron ) . as a combination , due to the different behavior of the extrinsic mechanism and the gluon - gluon fusion mechanism ,",
    "the total cross sections under gm - vfns possess smaller uncertainties in comparison to that of ffns , which are @xmath82 and @xmath83 at @xmath73 gev when @xmath65 increased by @xmath75 gev at lhc and tevatron respectively .",
    "as a compensation of our previous work @xcite on the hadronic production of @xmath4 meson , we have reanalyzed the production under the gm - vfns , and a comparison with the estimations of ffns and gm - vfns is also presented . under the ffns , we only need to deal with the dominant gluon - gluon fusion mechanism as done in ref.@xcite .",
    "while under the gm - vfns , in addition to the gluon - gluon fusion mechanism , one also needs to consider the extrinsic heavy quark mechanism so as to make a more sound estimation . for the present case , it is found that the extrinsic @xmath14-quark mechanism can be as important as the gluon - gluon fusion mechanism , especially in small @xmath13 region .",
    "this shows that if the hadronic experiments such as those at lhc and at tevatron can accumulate enough data and measure very low @xmath13 events then they can provide a good platform to check which scheme is more appropriate .",
