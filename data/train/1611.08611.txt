    "the dwarf - irregular galaxy ic 10 in cassiopeia presents one of the most active starbursts in the local group and a unique environment to study the immediate relics of the most massive stars : black holes and neutron stars in high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) .",
    "motivated by the discovery of the black hole hmxb ic 10 x-1 @xcite and the very large amplitude transient ic 10 x-2 @xcite we conducted a 7-shot monitoring campaign with _",
    "chandra _  during 2009 - 10 . combined with deep observations taken in 2003 and 2006 ,",
    "we were able to span timescales ranging up to 7 years reaching a limiting sensitivity of @xmath2erg  s@xmath3 .",
    "this cadence and sensitivity , coupled with the angular resolution of _ chandra _ , enable light - curves to be constructed for individual point sources .",
    "ic 10 hosts a young ( @xmath56 @xmath6 yr ) stellar population @xcite accompanied by the highest known space - density of wolf rayet ( wr ) stars @xcite , which are the evolved helium cores of stars with initial stellar masses in excess of 20 @xmath7 .",
    "the star formation rate ( sfr ) is reported to be as high as 0.5 @xmath7@xmath8 @xcite , which when normalized by the mass of the galaxy ( 2 @xmath9 @xmath7 ; @xcite ) yields 2.5 @xmath10 @xmath7@xmath8 @xmath7@xmath3 which is among the highest specific sfrs in the local universe exceeding the values for the milky way ( mw ) , small magellanic cloud ( smc ) , and large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "depending on the indicators and methods used , there is an order of magnitude dispersion among sfr values for ic 10 @xcite .",
    "the chaotic structure of ic 10 is probably part of the picture and indeed much of the galaxy resembles an ob association , but on a kiloparsec scale @xcite .",
    "ic 10 is replete with a complex structure of @xmath11-bright and radio - bright bubbles , filaments , and hii regions , all signaling its turbulent evolution under the influence of the kinetic energy being injected by winds and supernovae .",
    "the similarities between ic10 and the smc are striking ; both are gas - rich dwarf irregulars and both are thought to have undergone tidal disruption in the recent past @xcite leading to triggered star formation activity .",
    "however , two critical differences exist between these galaxies that make ic 10 an exciting new laboratory for stellar astrophysics .",
    "the first and most important contrast is the time since star formation began .",
    "this is @xmath56 @xmath6 yr for ic 10 compared to 40 - 200 @xmath6 yr for the various distinct age - segregated populations identified in the smc @xcite , where the hmxbs are found in the 40 - 70 myr sub - population @xcite .",
    "the second contrast is in metallicity which for ic 10 is @xmath12 @xcite , intermediate between the smc and the mw .",
    "complete censuses of x - ray binary populations in local group galaxies are a powerful approach to discover the underlying physics of stellar evolution , for example the effect of metallicity .",
    "the magellanic clouds have historically served this purpose , but gaining proper control of secular differences between galaxies requires new independent laboratories such as ic 10 to be added .",
    "important large samples have been constructed by mining the _ chandra _  archive , ( for example @xcite ) and by concerted multi - year efforts to intensively observe nearby galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "an x - ray study of point sources in ic 10 was conducted by @xcite using single epoch data from _ xmm - newton _  and _",
    "chandra_. among their important findings was a population of point sources significantly above the expected background density and spatially concentrated within the optical outline of the galaxy .",
    "the combined x - ray spectrum of these point - sources was consistent with an absorbed power - law with parameters characteristic of hmxbs .",
    "key physics goals to be addressed by ic 10 s x - ray binary ( xrb ) sample include : constructing the x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) in order to compare it with the sfr history ; discovering what type of xrbs are formed at the earliest times ; and breaking the degeneracy between compact - object mass and accretion - mechanism that currently bedevils attempts to understand the nature of both ultraluminous x - ray ( ulx ) sources and the xlf - sfr relation .",
    "the relative proximity of ic10 is crucial because the individual xrbs can be studied in detail once they are identified . in the larger samples of galaxies ,",
    "the questions are addressed on a purely statistical basis . identifying optical counterparts to x - ray sources at the 660 kpc distance of ic 10",
    "is a daunting prospect since it lies at low galactic latitude and it is viewed by us through the outer portion of the galactic plane .",
    "since most xrbs are highly variable , a monitoring campaign offers an alternative path to discovering the nature of these individual sources .",
    "this paper begins with a uniform reduction / analysis of the _ chandra _  monitoring and archival observations and visualizations of the ccd data (   [ sect : obs ] ) followed by the construction of the source catalog (   [ sect : catalog ] ) and the generation of x - ray light curves (   [ sect : lc ] ) .",
    "we outline our spectral analysis using quantiles and ccd pulse - height spectra in   [ sect : quantile ] , we briefly describe how optical counterparts were identified (   [ sect : optical ] ) , and then we proceed to   [ sect : discussion ] , where we look at each variable source in turn in order to summarize the available information and to discuss its likely nature . finally , in   [ sect : conclusions ] , we present an overview of the results and we lay out the direction of future progress .",
    "a monitoring series of 7@xmath1315 ksec _ chandra _  observations , spaced at roughly 6-week intervals was obtained during 2009 - 2010 .",
    "we used the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) , positioning the galaxy ic 10 on the back - illuminated chip s3 .",
    "the observing cadence was designed to match the native variability timescales of hmxbs which tend to be transients with typical outbursts lasting for 1 - 3 weeks repeating on intervals of months .",
    "the individual exposure times were calculated to reach a limiting luminosity of 10@xmath14 erg  s@xmath3  ( assuming 5 net acis - s counts at the high resolution mirror assembly ( hrma ) aim - point for a detection threshold ) .",
    "this sensitivity would reach the typical luminosity of hmxbs ( both persistent supergiant hmxbs and be - hmxbs in outburst ) .",
    "a pair of very deep acis - s3 observations ( 2@xmath1345 ksec ) made in november 2006 provide a reference dataset for improved source positions and spectral information .",
    "the original @xcite _ chandra _  ( acis - s3 , 1/2 subarray ) observation of 30 ksec made in 2003 was included in our analysis to provide additional time baseline for the variability study and to make use of their published source identifications .",
    "the complete listing of 10 observation identifiers ( obsids ) comprising the dataset is summarized in table  [ tab : dataset ] .",
    "all of the data were processed in a uniform way following the standard _ ciao _",
    "threads , and the prescription of @xcite for consistent selection of energy bands ",

    "smoothing is necessary to create an image from sparse data .",
    "the adaptive smoothing maps created with _",
    "ciao smooth _ for the b - band images were applied to make the s & h band images , and all 3 bands used the exposure maps generated for 1.5 kev photons ( roughly the peak of acis sensitivity ) . to illustrate our search for transient sources we present all 10 b - band images in figure  [ fig : cxo_images ] which shows a number of prominent transient events and",

    "for each _ chandra _  observation we ran _ ciao _ _ wavdetect _ on each of the three energy bands ( s , b , h ) .",
    "_ wavdetect _ was run with the default significance threshold of @xmath15 at wavelet scales of 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , and 16 pixels .",
    "each detection is given its own source @xmath16 , and the detections in each band are cross - matched by position ( 95% uncertainty radius computed by the formula of @xcite ) to produce a list of unique sources within the observation , linked by an identifier called @xmath17 .",
    "the list derived from the 90 ksec stacked @xmath18 57082 was bore - sighted against the optical catalog of @xcite .",
    "source lists from each @xmath18 were then corrected to the same reference frame , using the coordinates of ic 10 x-1 ( by far the brightest source ) .",
    "we then compiled the final point - source catalog from the entire set of observations by using the tool _",
    "classifytable _ in the _ starbase _ relational database package .",
    "_ classifytable _ is used to group together sources that lie within a certain distance ( 5  ) of each other , these matches are then filtered using the 95% uncertainty radii .",
    "all detections belonging to a unique source are linked by the identifier _ srcnumber_. coordinates and error radius are inherited from the @xmath16 with the  best \" detection ( most counts , smallest error radius ) . the number of unique x - ray point sources detected in each observation is listed in the final column of table  [ tab : dataset ] .",
    "next , the unique source list for each observation was bore - sighted to the unique source list obtained from the deep merged dataset of obsids 07082 & 08485 ( which had identical pointing ) .",
    "this reference data set had itself already been bore - sighted to the optical catalog of @xcite .",
    "the bore - sighting procedure between x - ray observations used only the brightest source ( ic 10 x-1 ) due to its very small statistical positional uncertainty arising from its large count rate .",
    "once bore - sighting was complete , we constructed a master catalog using a 5 arcsec matching radius around each source ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "finally we applied a filter to eliminate false matches : requiring the matching @xmath17 coordinates to lie within the quadrature sum of their 95% error radii and an additional 0.75 \" arcsec accounting for statistical and systematic errors .",
    "the resulting master catalog contains 110 unique point sources , many of which have multiple detections .",
    "all detections of the same source share the same _ srcnumber _ identifier and a _ chandra _   source name based on the usual convention ( cxou j hhmmss@xmath19ddmmss ) taking the coordinates from the @xmath16 with the smallest error circle .",
    "the _ chandra _  observations all have slightly different fields of view as a consequence of the operational requirements of the spacecraft . a certain pitch and roll angle",
    "are required to maintain the proper orientation with respect to the sun .",
    "we worked with the mission planners to adjust the exact pointing for each observation once the pitch / roll combination was known .",
    "this enabled us to keep most of the same point sources within the acis - s3 ccd during each observation .",
    "the master catalog was processed with a _ unix _ script that called _ ciao _ to query the exposure map for the coordinates of every source in each observation to determine whether the source was actually observed with acis - s3 or not .",
    "if the source was observed _ and not detected _ by _ wavdetect _ , then a new row was added to the master catalog with the modified julian date ( mjd ) of the observation , the value @xmath20 =  null \" and an estimated upper - limit for the broad - band count rate .",
    "this upper limit was computed as the equivalent count - rate that would generate 5 net counts at the hrma aim - point according to pimms ( portable multi - mission simulatorbin / tools / w3pimms / w3pimms.pl ] ) for an absorbed power - law spectrum ( @xmath21 @xmath22 ) divided by the normalized exposure - map value at the source location .",
    "the simulations of  @xcite indicate this is a @xmath2375% detection probability for the off - axis distances encountered within the s3 chip , at low background rates .",
    "if the source was found to lie outside the s3 chip , then no modifications were made to the table .",
    "the master source catalog is maintained as a single table , combining all detections and upper limits , from which light curves are extracted as described in the next section .",
    "positional matching to the catalog of @xcite was performed using our and their 95% error radii in quadrature ; the resulting ids are provided in table  [ tab : variables ] . to facilitate observations at other wavelengths , and cross - correlation with other databases we provide our complete point - source catalog as supplemental data in the online journal .",
    "light curves for all of the 110 unique sources were constructed by processing the master catalog with a _ unix _ script which computed the following parameters for each group of rows bearing the same @xmath24 identifier : number of occasions observed ( @xmath25 ) , number of detections in the broad - band ( @xmath26 ) , minimum count rate ( @xmath27 ) , maximum count rate ( @xmath28 ) , average count rate ( @xmath29 ) ; root - mean - square @xmath30 ; variability range ( @xmath31 = @xmath28 - @xmath27 ) ; variability ratio ( @xmath32 ) ; relative variability ( @xmath33 ) ; and total number of net broad - band counts ( @xmath34 ) obtained by summing the values from each detection . in computing the above parameters we included all b - band detections and b - band upper limits , except that @xmath35 ( and its associated error bar ) are required for a positive detection .",
    "the complete set of parameters characterizing each source are provided in the online journal as supplemental data accompanying table  [ tab : variables ] , which shows only the variable objects , whose selection is described below .",
    "light curves were plotted for all x - ray sources in the master catalog ; selected examples are shown in figures  [ fig : lcs_gt10 ] ,  [ fig : lcs_gt5 ] , and  [ fig : lcs_lt5 ] .",
    "the plots display detections in all 3 energy bands and upper limits for observations with no b - band detection .",
    "all 110 light curves were visually examined alongside the _ acis _ images to verify the detections and to note any abnormalities such as sources falling very close to the edge of a ccd or having a close neighbor . in this way",
    ", we flagged 8 sources as  probably false \" ( objects detected only once at the extreme edge of the ccd ) and 4 sources as being duplicates ( multiple detections of a real source being falsely identified as separate sources when detected in subsequent observations ) .",
    "these eventualities are expected , and the number of cases was within the expected range .",
    "_ wavdetect _ expects to generate one false source per ccd ( i.e. @xmath23 10 in total ) and faint off - axis sources are subject to larger positional errors .",
    "we note that most of the sources were detected in at least two independent observations .",
    "specifically , 43 sources were detected more than once in the b - band , 36 only once in b - band ( some of which were also detected in a separate observation in s or h only ) , and 25 were only ever detected in the s or h band .",
    "the probability of a source with multiple detections being false is extremely small given the low surface density of sources .",
    "the light - curve parameters described above ( and given in table  [ tab : variables ] ) were used to identify variable and transient sources by sorting on the @xmath36 and @xmath37 parameters . assuming the usual statistical definitions , a light curve with @xmath38 is variable at the 99% confidence level .",
    "there are 21 such objects , listed in table  [ tab : variables ] ranked in descending order by @xmath38 .",
    "our criterion for detecting a variable or transient source is at least one b - band detection with count rate at least @xmath39 above the lowest upper limit ; thus , only real sources are included in table  [ tab : variables ] .",
    "complete data for each variable source are provided in tabular form as `` data - behind - the figure '' accompanying this paper in the online journal .",

    "from a total of 110 unique point sources detected in 10 _ chandra _  observations ( years 2003 - 2010 ) , we found 21 that are variable at the 3@xmath0 level .",
    "the x - ray light curves exhibit a range of qualitatively different behaviors , including transients , large amplitude variables , and persistent sources with duty cycles ranging up to 100% .",
    "analysis in the x - ray quantile diagram reveals a split between soft thermal sources and harder power - law like spectra that cluster along the model grid contour consistent with the average column density towards ic 10 .",
    "while this separation is not a complete diagnostic of source classes , it supports to a large extent the hypothesis of @xcite that ic 10 hosts numerous hmxbs .",
    "our variability study , better positions , and the increased spectral s / n ratios made possible by analyzing a cumulative 225 ksec of chandra exposure ( vs the previous 30 ksec ) have provided a richer and more detailed view of this population . in this paper , we were able to confidently classify most of the variable sources and to usefully constrain the nature of the remaining sources .",
    "deeper observations are needed to increase the number of individual sources for which x - ray spectral fits can be obtained .",
    "variability is a characteristic of all known astrophysical x - ray production mechanisms , and the fact that the majority of the catalog sources do not make the 3@xmath0 cut is due to their faintness ( and consequent difficulty in establishing variability ) of most objects encountered .",
    "the hmxb candidates presented in this paper are all characterized by power - law spectra , strong x - ray variability , and either the presence of an optical counterpart consistent with an o / b star in ic10 ; or the lack of an optical counterpart to a limiting magnitude of @xmath127 which still allows for the existence of an early type star ( b0v or fainter , @xmath100 for minimal ic 10 extinction @xmath89 ) .",
    "substantially higher extinction values do exist in parts of ic 10 as there is a high degree of structure in the interstellar medium ( ism ) of that galaxy . in the former category ,",
    "we find src 1 , src 8 , and src 29 , in addition to the well - studied src 20 = ic 10 x-1 and src 46 = ic 10 x-2 , for a total of 5 hmxbs with optical counterparts , only one of which has a known orbital period and three have no optical spectrum .    of the sample in this paper ,",
    "only 12 x - ray sources have positional optical counterparts in @xcite , among which we identify 4 sources with @xmath11 line emission .",
    "optical spectra have been obtained for just 4 counterparts to x - ray variables .",
    "these were the known bh+wr binary ic 10 x-1 ; the previously reported hmxb ic 10 x-2 ; a reddened early - type star associated with the hard absorbed transient source # 29 ; and a foreground dme star associated with the soft transient source # 90 .    given that highly luminous stars exist in ic 10 , spectroscopic followup is required to positively identify the majority of the optical counterparts to these sources .",
    "the photometric colors of the counterparts are expected to be somewhat degenerate between extinction and spectral type due to the large line - of - sight depth through the foreground galactic plane .",
    "future efforts must be directed at obtaining optical spectra of the counterparts which can be efficiently done with multi - object spectrographs on 8-m telescopes thanks to the compact size of ic10 .",
    "positive spectroscopic identification of the x - ray binaries requires spectral types , confirmed ic 10 membership via radial velocity , and ultimately orbital elements from rv and/or photometry .",
    "the distance and extinction values to ic 10 indicate that only the upper - end of the spectral sequence can be resolved from ground - based telescopes , however this is not an insurmountable problem since hmxbs are formed from precisely these stars .",
    "this paper reports objects with x - ray properties similar to known hmxbs , both with and without candidate optical counterparts .",
    "no transients were seen at super - eddington luminosity , thus no candidate bh x - ray novae occurred during any of the observations .",
    "transient x - ray sources are conventionally identified by a variability ratio in the @xmath110 range and transient candidates in the 5 - 10 range ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we are aware of powerful and innovative approaches that rely on bayesian analysis ( e.g. @xcite ) to obtain the probability that the variability ratio for an individual source lies within the range of interest .",
    "these techniques reduce bias and hence offer two advantages : ( a ) enhanced sensitivity to extremely faint transients even in the case of a very small number of observations , ( b ) reduced tendency to falsely identify positive photon - counting fluctuations as variability .",
    "our selection criteria are based on the conventional statistical prescription for comparing data points .",
    "in particular the 3@xmath0 cut is conservative ( 99% significance ) and avoids sweeping up low probability transient candidates . with 110 point sources detected , the expectation is of order 1 false variable candidate out of the 21 variables identified . admittedly , the cost of this conservative approach is reduced sensitivity to fainter transients",
    ". there are 36 single - detection b - band sources , only 2 of which made it into the sample presented here .",
    "as we showed in figure  [ fig : hardint ] all of those 34 other objects are very faint , therefore they are not hmxbs in outburst .    as to the nature of the new hmxbs reported here",
    ", we can already assert that they are a different population than that in the magellanic clouds .",
    "the young age of the underlying stellar population and the elevated production of massive stars and stellar remnants noted by other authors ( e.g. @xcite ) have implications for the expected x - ray binary population .",
    "the smc with its episodic starburst history contains at least 100 known or suspected hmxbs , the vast majority of which are be+ns systems , and all earlier than b3 @xcite .",
    "it was first proposed by @xcite that the narrow spectral type range seen in be - hmxb is an evolutionary signature .",
    "this idea is supported by the groundbreaking work of @xcite , who showed the smc be - hmxb are associated with distinct stellar populations of age 40 - 70 myr and @xcite who found a similar age - association for hmxbs in ngc 300 and ngc 2403 . in ic 10",
    "there has not been sufficient time to form these objects , therefore we expect to see completely different hmxb species . following this logic , we assume that the be phenomenon is not yet widespread in ic 10 , hence accretion - powered x - rays must involve mass donors with stronger winds and/or smaller orbital separation in order to deliver the requisite mass - transfer rate .",
    "supergiants and wr stars are the obvious candidates , although we find only one x - ray source ( x-1 ) coincident with the wr catalog of @xcite ; weak - lined wr stars could be present but as - yet unidentified .",
    "some very young hmxbs have recently been reported : @xcite found an age of @xmath45 myr for sn 2010da ( an hmxb in ngc 300 ) ; in own galaxy , cir x-1 has been revealed as the youngest known related example at @xmath44600 yr @xcite . however , there is currently debate about the nature of the optical companion in sn 2010da ( lbv , yellow supergiant , etc . ) , and the companion in cir x-1 has proven infamously difficult to classify .",
    "@xcite proposed that the recent sn in cir x-1 has shock - heated the envelope of the companion , puffing it up , which can reconcile the strangely red color for an hmxb .",
    "consequently we are wary of excluding red objects from the ic 10 sample and we must obtain spectra of all counterparts .    in summary , our _ chandra _   monitoring study has found a heterogeneous population of exotic hmxbs in ic 10 .",
    "we are witnessing a starburst at an early stage , even perhaps before its peak @xcite , so these unfamiliar systems will play an important role in understanding the age / metallicity dependence of massive binaries , the x - ray binary luminosity function , and ulx sources .",
