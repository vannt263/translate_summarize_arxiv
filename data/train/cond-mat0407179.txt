    "one of the most important characteristics of the electronic structure of the cuprates is the strong hybridization between the cu 3@xmath1 level and the o 2@xmath2 level , where @xmath2 denotes the @xmath3 or @xmath4 orbitals pointing towards the cu ions . because of this hybridization",
    ", the cu - o bond has a strong covalent character and a large energy splitting exists between the bonding ( @xmath5 ) and antibonding ( @xmath6 ) molecular orbitals . in the ionic limit without hybridization",
    ", this energy splitting corresponds to the energy difference between the atomic @xmath1 and @xmath2 orbitals , which is @xmath7 ev .",
    "@xcite as the @xmath8 hybridization becomes larger , the energy splitting ( @xmath9 ) between the two molecular orbitals increases , reflecting the increasingly covalent nature of the cu - o bonding .",
    "thus , @xmath9 is a direct measure of the cu - o hybridization , and could serve as an independent route to determine the value of the hopping matrix element , @xmath0 , since it is believed that @xmath9 is directly related to @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite although there has been no systematic theoretical study of @xmath9 , the values obtained from first - principles calculations range widely from @xmath10 ev to @xmath11  ev . @xcite for example , martin and hay @xcite have carried out an _ ab initio _ quantum chemistry calculation of a cluster of copper oxygen octahedra ( cuo@xmath12 ) in @xmath13 , and obtained @xmath14 ev , while in a recent density - functional calculation of a similar cluster , hsser and coworkers reported a value of @xmath15  ev .",
    "@xcite experimentally , determining this quantity has been very difficult , since in this energy range transitions involving the la @xmath16 bands dominate the spectral features of optical spectroscopy .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , we report a systematic experimental study of @xmath9 , the excitation energy from bonding to antibonding molecular orbitals , using the recently developed resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs ) technique .",
    "@xcite rixs is ideally suited for this study , since it provides element - specific and momentum - dependent information for electronic excitations .",
    "@xcite by tuning the incident photon energy to the cu - k absorption edge , one can gain information concerning excitations localized around the cu sites without suffering from problems due to the la bands .",
    "furthermore , the momentum - resolving capability of rixs provides additional information : the dispersion of such molecular orbital ( mo ) excitations . in this work , we find that @xmath9 exhibits a strong , systematic dependence on the cu - o bond length ( @xmath17 ) , increasing as @xmath17 is decreased .",
    "in addition , for materials with a small @xmath17 and correspondingly large @xmath9 , a relatively large dispersion of the mo excitation is observed .",
    "we discuss the implication of these observations for understanding the electronic structure of the cuprates .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the rixs experiments were carried out at the advanced photon source on the undulator beamline 9idb .",
    "experimental details have been described elsewhere.@xcite single crystal samples used in our measurements are listed in table  [ table1 ] , along with several samples studied in earlier rixs experiments . in table",
    "[ table1 ] , @xmath17 and the experimental configuration is listed for each material .",
    "all measurements were performed at room temperature except for those on the lsco17 sample . in our rixs experiments ,",
    "the scattering plane was vertical and the polarization of the incident x - ray , @xmath18 , was perpendicular to the scattering plane .",
    "the polarization direction was kept fixed along the direction specified in table  [ table1 ] , where the coordinate system reference is the @xmath1 orbital .",
    "that is , the copper oxygen plaquette lies in the @xmath19-plane , while the @xmath20-direction is perpendicular to the plaquette .",
    "we use the notation of reduced momentum transfer * q * throughout this paper , with the @xmath21 direction along the cu - o bond direction .    before discussing the experimental results in detail , it is useful to first review the second - order rixs process to understand the nature of the observed excitation . in the ground state ,",
    "the holes are located in the antibonding molecular orbital which is a combination of a cu hole state ( @xmath22 ) and an oxygen ligand hole state ( @xmath23 ) , with more weight on the @xmath22 state . in the intermediate state of this resonance process , a cu @xmath24 electron is excited to the cu @xmath25 band , and the core hole potential alters the balance between the @xmath22 and the @xmath23 states .",
    "then the lowest energy state is predominantly @xmath26 , which is lower than @xmath27 .",
    "these states form the so - called well - screened and poorly - screened features , respectively , of the cu k - edge x - ray absorption spectra ( xas ) .",
    "as discussed in detail by hill and coworkers , @xcite these intermediate states can decay into an excited state in which the hole in the antibonding molecular orbital is filled with an electron , creating a hole in the bonding orbital , and an energy loss in the outgoing photon .",
    "the rixs process thus creates a charge - transfer excitation from bonding to antibonding molecular orbitals .    in our measurements",
    ", we have carefully studied the incident energy dependence in order to determine the resonance energy , for which the mo excitation has the maximum intensity . in most cases ,",
    "the resonance energy , which is listed in table  [ table1 ] , corresponds to the higher energy peak ( poorly - screened feature ) in the xas . on the other hand ,",
    "the intensity of lower energy excitations near the charge transfer gap ( @xmath28 ev ) is strongly enhanced when the incident energy corresponds to the well - screened intermediate state , as reported in earlier studies.@xcite the resonance energy depends on the direction of the polarization vector .",
    "detailed results of the incident energy dependence study will be published elsewhere .",
    "however , one should note that the energy - loss associated with the mo excitation does not depend on the incident polarization of the photon , although different @xmath25 states ( e.g. , @xmath29 or @xmath30 ) are involved in the intermediate state , as the polarization is varied with respect to the @xmath19-plane .",
    "in fig .  [ fig1 ] , representative rixs scans are plotted .",
    "these are energy - loss scans taken at a fixed momentum transfer with the incident energy of the x - ray photon fixed at the values listed in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "the momentum transfer for all these scans has been fixed at * q*=(@xmath31 0 ) , which is the minimum energy position .",
    "the most striking feature in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is the large shift of the excitation energy from @xmath32 ev for 2122 to @xmath33 ev for lsco17 . to analyze this shift quantitatively ,",
    "we have fitted the observed excitation spectra to a simple lorentzian lineshape and extracted the peak positions , which are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) as a function of cu - o bond length , @xmath17 .",
    "a few comments are in order regarding the data analysis .",
    "first , as is evident from the instrumental resolution plotted as a dashed line in fig .  [ fig1 ] , the observed excitations are not resolution - limited , hence justifying our simple fitting procedure , which does not convolve the data with the instrumental resolution .",
    "second , in several cases , we observe more than one type of excitation in these scans .",
    "for example , the srcuo@xmath34 data clearly shows a second feature around @xmath35  ev , in addition to the main peak around @xmath32  ev . in the 2342 case",
    ", there also seems to be two additional features , one at higher energy ( @xmath33 ev ) and the other at lower energy ( @xmath10 ev ) .",
    "however , it is difficult to identify these weak features ( if present ) in the data for the other samples,@xcite and we have chosen to fit all the scans with a single lorentzian peak with a broad width .",
    "the peak positions extracted from our analysis are , therefore , those of the dominant features . in addition , the peak width extracted from the fits might in some cases arise from a distribution of several peaks over a wide energy range , rather than from a finite inverse lifetime of a single excitation . finally ,",
    "as discussed below , we observe dispersion of the mo excitation with momentum transfer .",
    "this can be as large as @xmath36 ev in some of the compounds studied , as shown in fig .",
    "thus , the peak position of the mo excitation depends not only on the sample , but also on * q*. the scans shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] all are taken at the minimum energy position , @xmath37 , and the peak positions plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) are the values measured at this position .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) , the energy of the mo excitation exhibits a strong dependence on @xmath17 .",
    "it is noteworthy that the excitation energy exhibits such a systematic dependence on the _ local _ structure , and that it is apparently insensitive to whether the crystal has a planar , corner - sharing , or edge - sharing chain strucutre .",
    "this is consistent with our assignment of these features as mo excitations localized within a single cu - o plaquette .",
    "the overall trend exhibited in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) is not unexpected .",
    "intuitively , as the cu and o atoms move closer , the @xmath8 overlap will increase , and the cu - o bonding becomes more covalent with a larger energy splitting @xmath9 .",
    "what is surprising is how strong this @xmath17 dependence is .",
    "we have modeled the @xmath17-dependence of @xmath9 as a power law ( @xmath38 ) and find @xmath39 , shown as a solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) .",
    "note that the mo excitation energy is expected to be given by@xcite @xmath40 , where @xmath41 ev is the hopping matrix element between the oxygen @xmath42 orbitals.@xcite since @xmath43 , this expression leads to @xmath44 , to a first approximation , and one then expects similar a @xmath45-dependence for @xmath9 and @xmath0 .",
    "our results then implies that the @xmath45-dependence of @xmath0 is much stronger than that expected from tight - binding theory , for which @xmath46 is predicted.@xcite as plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) , the observed rixs data clearly deviates from the @xmath47 behavior ( dashed line ) .",
    "we also note that the @xmath48 behavior determined from our rixs measurements is different from the earlier report of @xmath49 by cooper and coworkers , which was estimated indirectly from a three - band hubbard model expression.@xcite    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the dispersion of the mo excitation is plotted as a function of * q * for selected samples .",
    "these data suggest that the picture of a completely localized mo excitation is an oversimplification  such a model would predict no dispersion of these features .",
    "the data of fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) , which show significant dispersion for @xmath50  , suggest then that this localized picture breaks down for small bond distances . for the lsco17 sample ,",
    "the dispersion bandwidth is about @xmath51 ev , with the minimum excitation energy occuring at the zone boundary , implying an indirect gap .",
    "note that this is completely different from the direct nature of the lower energy charge - transfer gap as reported in ref .  .",
    "as @xmath9 decreases ( e.g. , lco and lcco ) , the dispersion of the mo excitation becomes weaker .",
    "for the samples with an even smaller @xmath9 , the dispersion becomes flat , as shown for the 2342 sample ( figs . 2 and 3 ) .",
    "limited momentum dependence measurements for the 2122 sample ( not shown ) also show a dispersionless behavior .",
    "the size of the observed dispersion along the cu - o bond direction is plotted against @xmath17 in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the size of the dispersion and @xmath9 both increase as @xmath52 decreases .",
    "this suggests that the bandwidth of the dispersion is also controlled by the hopping parameter @xmath0 .",
    "such behavior would , of course , be expected from the increased overlap of the wavefunctions , since charge carriers then become less localized .",
    "however , the simplest picture of delocalized electrons fails to describe the observed dispersion .",
    "for example , the bandwidths of the cu - o bonding and antibonding bands in lco are very large @xmath53 ev , and interband transitions between these two bands would have a _ direct _ gap of @xmath10 ev .",
    "one of the most surprising results in this study is that the @xmath54 scaling seems to apply to different structures .",
    "in contrast , previous studies of the bond - length scaling of various quantities , such as charge - transfer gap ( @xmath55 ) , or superexchange interaction ( @xmath56 ) , have been limited to compounds with corner - sharing structures.@xcite it is well known that such quantities as superexchange coupling depend not only on the @xmath8 hybridization , but also crucially on the angle between the two cu - o bonds.@xcite one can argue that @xmath9 is a better measure of cu - o hybridization than @xmath56 or @xmath57 , since it is only dependent on @xmath58 and not on the presence of neighboring atoms .",
    "we have noted that the @xmath48 dependence inferred from our study deviates significantly from the tight - binding picture .",
    "it also appears to give rise to discrepancies with other experiments .",
    "for example , for materials with the corner - sharing structure , the three - band hubbard model gives @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is an effective onsite colomb interaction which is assumed to be constant . if we use the experimentally determined@xcite @xmath61 and our @xmath48 result , we obtain @xmath62 , which clearly disagrees with the much weaker @xmath45-dependence of @xmath56 observed in various experiments , including two magnon raman scattering.@xcite one might expect that this discrepancy could be resolved by considering the fact that , due to strong electron correlations , the simple tight - binding picture of covalent bonding has to be modified .",
    "in fact , mizuno and coworkers@xcite considered two contributions to @xmath0 . that is , @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the contribution from the atomic potential which depends only on @xmath17 , while @xmath65 is the contribution from the madelung potential , which depends on the detailed arrangement of the neighboring ions",
    ". however , the calculated contribution from the madelung potential is of order of @xmath66 ev or smaller,@xcite so that this alone is not enough to explain the @xmath67 dependence .",
    "these results may be suggesting that one has to abandon the simple relationship of @xmath44 .",
    "certainly , as discussed above , the picture of a completely localized mo excitation is apparently an oversimplification , since it breaks down as @xmath17 becomes shorter  as evidenced by the sizable dispersion observed in lsco17 .",
    "thus , if a more realistic expression for @xmath9 is used , @xmath68 scaling law might be recovered .",
    "for example , a recent first - principles calculation has emphasized the role of apical oxygens in the systematics of high temperature superconductivity @xcite .",
    "indeed , the scaling plot in fig .  [ fig2 ] also exhibits some systematic dependence on the number of apical oxygens,@xcite and it may be interesting to further investigate the role played by apical oxygens .",
    "certainly , a systematic _ ab initio _ calculation of the @xmath52-dependence of mo excitation energy in large clusters would be highly desirable and may help to clarify the relationship between @xmath9 , @xmath0 , and @xmath17 .    to summarize ,",
    "we have studied a charge - transfer excitation in various cuprate compounds using resonant inelastic x - ray scattering technique .",
    "we assign this excitation to a mostly localized molecular orbital excitation , that is , an excitation from a bonding to an antibonding molecular orbital .",
    "we have found that this molecular orbital excitation energy , which is a measure of the hopping matrix element @xmath0 , exhibits a systematic cu - o bond length dependence , which is much stronger than that expected from tight - binding theory .",
    "we have also observed a sizable dispersion of this excitation in some materials , suggesting that this molecular orbital excitation becomes less localized as the @xmath8 hybridization becomes large .",
