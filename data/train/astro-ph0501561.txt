    "we present the latest results from the _ chandra _ observations of supernova remnant ( snr ) 1987a . as of 2004 january",
    ", we have performed a total of nine observations of snr 1987a with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) on board _ chandra _ ( table  1 ) .",
    "we have presented the results from the first seven observations in the literature @xcite .",
    "chandra_/acis observations of snr 1987a have revealed a ring - like x - ray morphology with an asymmetric x - ray intensity distribution between the eastern and the western sides of the snr .",
    "x - ray - bright spots have developed around the ring , and soft x - ray flux has been nonlinearly increasing .",
    "the x - ray spectrum was found to be thermal in origin , arising from the interaction of the blast wave shock with the circumstellar material .",
    "previous works @xcite successfully demonstrated that these x - ray features , when compared with the optical and radio emission features , were consistent with the standard physical model : i.e. , the sn blast wave shock is approaching the dense inner ring which was produced by non - spherically symmetric stellar winds from the massive progenitor @xcite . in this model , the optically bright spots and the soft x - ray spots",
    "are produced by the decelerated shock entering the dense protrusions on the surface of the inner ring , while the radio and the hard x - ray emission features originate from the fast shock propagating into the tenuous hii region between the dense protrusions @xcite .",
    "considering its core - collapse , type ii sn origin from a massive progenitor @xcite , as _ confirmed _ by the detection of the accompanying neutrino burst @xcite , the presence of a compact stellar remnant is predicted for snr 1987a .",
    "there has , however , been no evidence for a pointlike source at the center of the remnant , which has been attributed to optically thick stellar ejecta material surrounding the putative central point source @xcite .    table  1 .",
    "_ chandra _ observations of snr 1987a + [ tbl : tab1 ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath8@xmath9@xmath10/@xmath11 = 699.7/569 .",
    "+ @xmath12 the best - fit n@xmath13 = 1.8@xmath14 @xmath1 10@xmath15 @xmath3 .",
    "+    although the overall x - ray spectrum of snr 1987a can be described by a single temperature plane - shock in non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) , the physical model of the shock - inner ring interaction indicates that x - ray emission most likely originates from multiple velocity components of the shock in various ionization states .",
    "considering such a multi - component shock , a two - temperature shock model was implemented in order to fit the observed x - ray spectrum @xcite .",
    "the two - temperature shock model may grossly oversimplify reality , but should be a physically more realistic model than a single shock . in this model ,",
    "the observed x - ray spectrum originates from two characteristic components .",
    "the soft component arises from a slow , decelerated shock entering the dense protrusions of the inner ring .",
    "the hard component is produced by a fast shock propagating into the low density hii region .",
    "the slow shock was then found to be in collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) , which was reasonable for the shocked dense circumstellar material @xcite .",
    "based on these previous results , we apply a two - component model to the latest data ( note : as discussed above , the overall shock phase for the latest x - ray spectrum might be different from that of previous observations . nonetheless , a two - temperature model should still be a useful approximation for the multi - phase shock ) . as of 2004 january , an electron temperature of @xmath16 @xmath0 0.23 kev is implied for the slow shock in cie condition , while it is @xmath16 @xmath0 2.2 kev for the fast shock in nei state .",
    "the best - fit ems imply electron densities @xmath17 @xmath0 6300 @xmath18 for the slow shock and @xmath17 @xmath0 280 @xmath18 for the fast shock .",
    "the hard to soft component em ratio shows a noticeable increase since 2002 december ( fig  4 ) , which suggests that a significant increase of the density in the fast shock might have begun . we note that the volume increase of the hard x - ray emitting plasma might also contribute to the observed em ratio increase .",
    "we , however , found that the effect from the volume increase is negligible .",
    "this density increase is consistent with the blast wave , for the most parts , now entering the main body of the dense inner ring .",
    "fig  5 is the x - ray lightcurve of snr 1987a .",
    "the steep , non - linear increase of the 0.5@xmath72 kev band x - ray flux continues . as of 2004 january ,",
    "the observed 0.5@xmath72 kev x - ray flux is @xmath19 @xmath0 8.2 @xmath1 10@xmath2 ergs @xmath3 s@xmath4 which is @xmath05 times higher than 1999 october .",
    "following the same method described by park et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , we fit the lightcurve assuming an exponential density distribution along the radius of the inner ring .",
    "the best - fit model indicates that a density ratio between the high - density inner ring and the low - density hii region ( _ interior _ to the inner ring ) is @xmath018 , and that a scale height of the exponential density distribution between inner ring and the hii region is @xmath00.015 pc at a distance of 50 kpc .",
    "the estimated density ratio is consistent with the soft to hard component density ratio derived from the two - component spectral fit .",
    "after @xmath017 years of the sn explosion , we still find no direct evidence of a pointlike source at the center of snr 1987a .",
    "utilizing a monte carlo simulation @xcite , we estimate a 90% upper limit on the 3@xmath78 kev band point source counts based on the latest acis image of snr 1987a .",
    "we assume a power law spectrum of a photon index @xmath20 = 1.7 for the putative neutron star in order to estimate the x - ray flux corresponding to the derived upper limit on the point source counts .",
    "we note that the absorbing column toward the center of the snr is highly uncertain depending on the density structure of the actual stellar ejecta prevailing there . here we assume , as a first - order - estimation , a similar absorbing column @xmath21 as measured from the spectral fitting of the entire snr .",
    "we then obtain an upper limit of @xmath5 = 1.3 @xmath1 10@xmath6 ergs s@xmath4 on the 3@xmath710 kev band x - ray luminosity of the central point source . considering higher columns , for instance ,",
    "if the absorbing column for the point source was an order of magnitude higher than that for the entire snr , this upper limit could be a few times higher than the above estimate ."
