    "o.c . @xcite published a remarkable linear correlation between the logarithm of the ca  ii k emission full width at half maximum ( @xmath2 ) and the absolute visual magnitude of the star , @xmath0 .",
    "they presented that this holds for non - variable cool stars below type f , regardless of spectral type , [ fe / h ] , or intensity of the emission line .",
    "this correlation is useful to derive an @xmath0 for cool stars too distant for accurate parallaxes .",
    "this relationship can also be found in other spectral lines , were the first to publish a similar relationship between @xmath0 and the with of the mg  ii k line .",
    "the wilson - bappu ( hereafter wb ) effect has aided in studies of variable stars like t tauri stars as well as main sequence stars ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the wb effect has been invaluable for our ability to understand chromospheres and heating , see seminal work by , and @xcite . and derived a way to relate @xmath1 to stellar parameters : @xmath3^{0.0}$ ] .",
    "@xcite was able to establish that the wb effect is largely a result of the surface gravity of the star .",
    "the ca  ii line is so optically thick that the increase in width corresponds to an increase in column density in the chromosphere .",
    "this relationship between column density and @xmath1 is predicted to be insensitive to [ fe / h ] .",
    "accurate hipparcos parallaxes were used for the first time @xcite to study the wb effect for a large number of stars with accurate @xmath0 .",
    "their @xmath2 were taken from the large list published by @xcite .",
    "@xcite were the first to use hipparcos parallaxes and noticed that their small sample of supergiant stars showed unusually large @xmath2 and deviated from a linear trend .",
    "@xcite foudn that the wb effect has no [ fe / h ] dependence . however , they had relatively few stars compared to recent studies of the wb effect and there are few metal - poor stars in the solar neighborhood .",
    "a chromospheric study of metal - poor giants , @xcite , hereafter ds95 , demonstrated that extremely metal - poor stars ( [ fe / h ] @xmath4 -2.0 ) have a diminished @xmath1 and did not follow the wb relationship previously established by @xcite .",
    "the field giants they studied were too far away to have accurate parallaxes , therefore they estimated their luminosity by fitting each star s colors to isochrones of m92 , an extremely metal - poor globular cluster .",
    "compared stars they studied in the globular cluster ngc2808 to the study of field stars by @xcite and came to a similar conclusion as @xcite , where more metal poor stars lie above the linear fit derived from more metal rich stars . however , their result was much more subtle then @xcite    we expand the work by @xcite and ds95 by using the latest hipparcos reduction and constraining our sample to stars with parallaxes greater than 3 times the probable error @xmath5 instead of @xmath6 .",
    "we have included all available measurements of @xmath1 from the literature , additional metal - poor stars observed at the apache point observatory , and ca  ii widths of stars from the globular clusters ngc2808 and @xmath7 cen .",
    "parallax is the most reliable and direct method of deriving @xmath0 . @xmath8",
    "constitute the largest sample and most reliable parallaxes , so we used @xmath8 parallaxes for stars that meet our criteria of @xmath9 .",
    "the reduction of @xmath8 data reduced the uncertainty in the parallaxes by a factor of 2 from @xcite , allowing us to study many more stars with acceptable parallaxes .    to investigate the wb effect and its dependence on [ fe / h ] , we have assembled data from a list of previously published ca  ii emission widths , @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath1 is defined as the width of the line , @xmath10 , having the instrumental profile removed .",
    "see figure [ profile ] for an example of how to measure @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath1 values came from the catalogs by @xcite , @xcite as well as @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . for the m - dwarfs in our sample",
    ", we used ca  ii k full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) measurements from @xcite .",
    "the sample of @xmath1 values still lacks a sufficient number of metal - poor stars , so we included the data by ds95 ( shown in table [ dupree ] ) . in the case of a star with multiple observations ,",
    "the most recent value of @xmath1 was used . for consistency",
    ", we used only values of @xmath1 .",
    "most of these publications used @xmath1 , but some published values of @xmath10 .",
    "the instrumental profiles of the spectrographs used were quoted in the paper and we subtracted the value from their published @xmath10 to obtain @xmath1 .",
    "we compared the different references and methods to look for systematic differences in @xmath1 that would affect our study .",
    "there was no difference in the wilson - bappu effect between the different references .",
    "we chose to use the catalog by @xcite for our values of [ fe / h ] for consistency .",
    "to study other main sequence stars , we analyzed the spectra from the mcdonald observatory archive and measured @xmath1 ourselves .",
    "the spectra from mcdonald were already reduced and flux calibrated , we only measured the width of the ca  ii k line ; see for the full list of stars .",
    "we also expanded the sample of metal poor stars with observatons with the arc echelle spectrograph ( arces ) on the 3.5 m telescope at apache point observatory ( apo ) .",
    "observations were made with the standard 1.6x 3.2slit .",
    "our spectra have a resolution of 31,500 , giving us a spectral profile of 7km / s .",

    "the resolution of the spectrograph used is 18,000 .",
    "we reduced our spectra with iraf using a data reduction guide , provided on the apo homepage ( www.apo.nmsu.edu/arc35m/instruments/arces/images/echelle_data_reduction_guide.pdf ) and the reduction script writen by john barentine ( http://www.apo.nmsu.edu/arc35m/instruments/arces/echellereductionguide.html ) .",
    "we took extreme care to get the wavelength calibration correct , since it is the @xmath11 that determines @xmath10 .",
    "our measurements , observation dates , and exposure times are presented in table [ apo ] .",
    "ds95 is of particular interest due to their result of an [ fe / h ] dependent wb effect .",
    "however , we choose to only include @xmath1 measurements that had a parallax above our 3@xmath12 criteria .",
    "nine of the twenty - four stars with @xmath1 have accurate parallaxes in @xmath8 .",
    "however , as we show in table [ dupree ] and figure [ dupgraph ] , these stars @xmath0 are on average brighter than @xmath0 derived from the 2007 parallaxes .",
    "ds95 used m92 to estimate the @xmath0 of all their stars , which have a variety of [ fe / h ] .",
    "m92 has a luminous and relatively blue rgb due to its low metallicity .",
    "when fitting stars of lower metallicity to a bright blue rgb , the stars will have a higher estimated @xmath0 than the star s true @xmath0 .",
    "we decided to leave out the stars that do not have parallaxes greater than @xmath13 due to the inconsistency of using the rgb to estimate @xmath0 .",
    "many of these metal poor stars are lost to us since we can not trust the method used to estimate @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite used gaussian fitting programs to determine @xmath10 because the stars they observed have strong emission profiles . however , our apo sample is very metal - poor and have small ca  ii k amplitudes is not easily fit with a gaussian profile .",
    "therefore , we chose to measure the profile emission width using the method of @xcite , as shown in figure [ profile ] .",
    "this method was also used on the full sample of spectra from mcdonald .",
    "allende prieto used the harlan j. smith 2.7 m telescope and the eso 1.52 m telescope to survey nearby stars with a spectral resolution of @xmath14 50,000 .",
    "we compared the wb effect for stars measured by gaussian fitting vs those stars measured using the fwhm and found that there are no systematic differences in @xmath1 space . for the spectra we obtained , we measured the same value of @xmath10 ( within a tolerance ) using the two methods .",
    "the tolerance becomes negligble after taking the logarithm .",
    "we include studies of globular clusters ngc 2808 and @xmath7 cen to expand our sample of metal - poor stars , allowing us to compare the wb effect among multiple stellar populations . provided measurements of @xmath2 and @xmath15 and ( m-@xmath0 ) of rbg stars in ngc 2808 .",
    "[ fe / h ] values of these stars were published by @xcite .",
    "the measurements are shown in table [ ngc2808 ] .",
    "omega cen has distance modulus of -14.07 ( @xcite , the 2010 edition ) .",
    "the @xmath15 and [ fe / h ] for stars roa159 , 256 , 238 , 523 , wfi321293 , and wfi140419 were published by .",
    "the identifier roa stars are from the catalog by @xcite and the stars identified by wfi were observed with the wide field imaging camera on the 2.2 m eso - mpi telescope in chile @xcite .",
    "we obtained the spectra used inthese studies and measured @xmath1 of these stars using the same method as apo and mcdonald , described above .",
    "the @xmath7 cen stars are presented in table [ omegacen ] .",
    "the wb effect was thought to be linear in @xmath2 until @xcite demonstrated that the brightest stars have smaller luminosities than their ca  ii widths would suggest .",
    "m - dwarfs showed nonlinearity in mg  ii and @xcite observed unusual nonlinearity in ca  ii fwhm .",
    "we used the stars in @xcite to compare against the other stars in our sample .",
    "@xcite noted that the ca  ii fwhm of those stars were within a few km / s of the intrinsic instumental profile .    our full sample shown in figure [ wbe ] with a weighted least squares fit of the linear part of the plot ( luminosity classes ii , iii , iv , and bright v s ) .",
    "eqn ( [ fit ] ) is the line of best fit for stars that fall between @xmath16 where the errors quoted are the standard deviation of the fit .",
    "it is evident that the highest and lowest luminosity class stars do not follow the linear trend of the giants as previously pointed out by @xcite . as a group , the supergiants ( and perhaps some misclassified luminosity class ii stars ) , follow a different trend than the rest of the giants .",
    "there seems to be a step discontinuity at the transition between the m - dwarfs and the k - dwarfs ( @xmath17 ) where there is a spread in @xmath0 .",
    "accounting for discrepancies in the dwarfs and supergiants is beyond the scope of this study and no higher order polynomial fit was attempted .",
    "@xmath18      main sequence stars have a strong and well established relationship between surface gravity , luminosity , and effective temperature .",
    "therefore , we wanted to comapre the expected and observed low luminosity wb effect . using the @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath0 from the zero - age main - sequence isochrones by @xcite and the relationship ( @xmath21 ) established by and we can compare expected and observed wb effect .",
    "the expected and observed low luminosity wb effect is shown in figure [ lowlum ] . the wb effect expected from",
    "should be linear down to @xmath0 = 13 .    using the conclusions of @xcite",
    ", we can speculate that the column depth of m - dwarf chromospheres is a lot smaller , leading to a thinner @xmath1 that we observe .",
    "we can use the same argument to say that supergiants have a much thicker chromosphere then models predict , leading to a larger @xmath1 than predicted .",
    "because of the large sample and well - behaved linear trend , the luminosity class ii , iii , iv , and v stars are best suited to examining the effect [ fe / h ] has .",
    "figure [ delta ] shows residuals from eqn ( [ fit ] ) , @xmath22 , as a function of [ fe / h ] .",
    "the averages of @xmath23 for the metal - poor stars and the metal - rich stars are @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "we conclude that on average , the stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath26 -1.0 do not deviate significantly from the linear fit . comparing @xmath27 between the metal - poor stars and metal - rich stars",
    "shows that they are drawn from the same distribution .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov test between the metal - poor and metal - rich samples yields a value of 0.27 with a significance of 0.0005 , confirming the null hypothesis that the two groups are drawn from the same parent distribution .",
    "@xmath28\\ ] ]    the lack of [ fe / h ] trend disagrees with the conclusions of ds95 .",
    "the latest @xmath8 @xmath0 differ from the values that they derived using m92 ( see figure [ dupgraph ] ) . using only @xmath0 from @xmath8 parallaxes ,",
    "the pearson s r correlation coefficient gives a value of 0.09 , indicating that @xmath29 is uncorrelated with [ fe / h ] .",
    "the study by compare stars from ngc 2808 with the study by @xcite noting that stars in ngc 2808 had a wider spread and tended to be brighter than the fit by @xcite would suggest .",
    "however , this could just be a sampling effect .",
    "our study shows conclusively that any dependence on [ fe / h ] is has a much smaller effect on the wb effect than log g.    we preserve equation [ fit ] as it stands , adding no term for [ fe / h ] .",
    "more accurate @xmath0 and a larger sample of @xmath2 will be required for a better wb relation .",
    "a re - analysis of the [ fe / h ] dependence will be possible after the gaia satellite measures parallax better than 0.3 mas out to v = 20 and",
    "better than 10@xmath30 at v=15 magnitude . by comparison",
    ", hipparcos measured parallaxes down to 5mas at a limiting magnitude around v=10 .",
    "we present the largest sample of stars to demonstrate the wilson - bappu effect over the largest range of @xmath0 to date .",
    "the main results of this paper are shown in figs [ wbe ] and [ delta ] .",
    "our large sample shows that there is a limited range where the wb effect is linear between @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "stars deviate from eq 1 above and below these ranges . to our knowledge",
    ", there is no theory of the ca  ii emission width that predicts that the relationship should be linear from @xmath33 or that a higher - order polynomial would be preferable , the issue of what curve should be drawn through the points is not important .",
    "what is important is what we can learn from devitation from the luminosity classes .",
    "ayres ( 1979 ) was one of the last developments on width - luminosity relationships like the wilson - bappu effect making arguments that increasing column density leads to an increase in the ca  ii width .",
    "we can come to the conclusion that the column density of m - dwarf chromospheres are lower than expected while the supergiants have a larger chromospheric column density than expected .",
    "modern instrumentation such as the @xmath8 satellite and ccd detectors on ground - based telescopes have permitted the wb effect to be extended to about @xmath0=+13 .",
    "the value of figure 3 . is the recognition of stars that deviate significantly from the mean so that so that their chromospheres may be investigated further in detail",
    ". variations in the intensity of the ca  ii lines in g and k dwarfs have yielded a great deal of information on their rotation and solar - type cycles of varying chromospheric activity @xcite .",
    "our data provides an observing list of stars whose monitoring should produce very interesting results , especially for giants and supergiants of types g , k , and m on their rotations and chromospheric activity variations .",
    "the improved 2007 hipparcos reduction has allowed us to determine @xmath0 of stars farther away , including more metal - poor stars .",
    "high resolution spectra of metal - poor globular cluster giants allowed us to explore the dependence of [ fe / h ] to answer some fundamental questions about the wb effect : is metallicity the cause of the 0.3 magnitude spread , or is it responsible for the deviations of the high and low luminosity trends ? .",
    "figure 4 demonstrates clearly the lack of dependence on [ fe / h ] , as initially asserted by @xcite and theoretically developed by @xcite .",
