    "@xmath5 physics is assuming a larger importance in lattice qcd and in ckm phenomenology with the arrival of the cleo - c charm factory @xcite .",
    "cleo - c will measure the leptonic decay constants @xmath6 and @xmath7 to an accuracy of around 2% .",
    "it will measure the amplitudes of the semileptonic decays @xmath8 and @xmath9 to an accuracy of around 1% .",
    "this will produce new determinations of the ckm matrix elements @xmath10 and @xmath11 to the accuracy that can be achieved in the required lattice calculations , and new checks of the unitarity triangle .",
    "new , precise tests of lattice qcd will come from the amplitude ratios @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "these ratios , which are independent of the ckm matrix , will provide the most precise tests in existence of the types of lattice qcd calculations required to extract ckm matrix elements from @xmath14 physics and @xmath5 physics .",
    "the recent discovery of the positive parity partners of the @xmath0 and the @xmath15 @xcite has added new interest to the spectrum of the @xmath0 system .",
    "the new states lie significantly below quark model predictions , and below the @xmath16 threshold , so the states are quite narrow .",
    "we use the `` asqtad '' order @xmath2 improved staggered light quark action , and the order @xmath17 improved fermilab heavy quark action . in unquenched calculations ,",
    "chiral extrapolation is the least well controlled remaining source of error .",
    "staggered fermions are the only method currently able to reach the region @xmath18 that seems to be required to control this error . using unquenched calculations that reach this region , a number of simple quantities that disagree with each other at the 10% level in the quenched approximation come into good agreement @xcite .",
    "we use the public milc unquenched configurations , with two light and one strange sea quarks , with properties    * @xmath19 , @xmath201/8 fm , * ( @xmath21 ) = ( 0.007,0.05 ) , ( 0.01,0.05 ) , ( 0.02,0.05 ) , ( 0.03,0.05 ) , ( true @xmath22 0.041 . ) , * @xmath23 500 configurations at each mass , 4 time sources each ,    as described in @xcite .    with staggered and naive light quarks ,",
    "the @xmath3 and @xmath4 are in the @xmath0 and @xmath15 correlators automatically and unavoidably because of fermion doubling .",
    "naive fermions possess a doubling symmetry , @xmath24 , that implies that quarks come in multiples with identical properties .",
    "local fermion operators connect to all of these doubled modes .",
    "therefore , because of the doubling symmetry , an pseudoscalar current couples to a positive parity scalar state as well : @xmath25 .",
    "oscillating signals for the positive parity states are present in the correlation functions for the @xmath0 and @xmath15 mesons , but they are small and hard to see , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : plotg ] , fig .",
    "[ fig : plotf ] shows the same correlation function with the leading exponential scaled out .",
    "the decay of the oscillating signal gives the mass of the @xmath3 state .",
    "because it is an excited state , the presence of a plateau is more difficult to ascertain than for a ground state .",

    "the @xmath0 spectrum on the @xmath27 lattices is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:0105 ] . very little dependence on the sea quark mass is observed . the @xmath3 and @xmath4 states lie somewhat above experiment .",
    "however , they are excited states and are somewhat more sensitive to the choices of the priors for the higher states in the bayes fits than are the ground states .",
    "we obtain 0.86 ( 2 ) for the hyperfine splitting divided by its experimental value .",
    "this may be compared with 0.82 ( 2 ) for the hyperfine splitting in charmonium .",
    "the most likely source for these errors is the one - loop correction to @xmath28 @xmath29 operator in the clover action .",
    "since this operator contributes twice to the charmonium hyperfine splitting and once to the the @xmath0 hyperfine splitting , it is reasonable to expect a larger effect in charmonium .",
    "this work is part of a larger project with the milc collaboration .",
    "preliminary results for the amplitude for leptonic decay of the @xmath0 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fds ] as a function of the sea quark mass ( using @xmath30 ) .",
    "there is little dependence on the sea quark mass , as expected .",
    "the one - loop fermilab heavy - staggered light axial current renormalization is in progress @xcite . to make an estimate of the one - loop correction",
    ", we use the formula @xmath31",
    "@xcite , using @xmath32 and @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "this leads to a current result for the decay constant of @xmath34 mev + /-",
    "@xmath35 . however the order @xmath36 correction could be large , potentially as large as 30% .",
    "this is to be compared with ryan s unquenched world average of 250 ( 30 ) mev @xcite and the unquenched nrqcd heavy staggered light result of 289(@xmath37 ) @xcite .",
    "the ckm independent quantity @xmath38 can be formed by combining this result with the result for the semileptonic amplitude in ref .",
