    "phase transitions in charged networks , as manifested by dramatic and reversible swelling of a polymer gel , have been studied for over thirty years .",
    "@xcite in such gels expansion is driven by the osmotic pressure of mobile counterions that are free to exchange with an external ion population in a donnan equilibrium .",
    "@xcite osmotic pressure varies under exchange of divalent for monovalent ions , so that that such systems can be critically sensitive to  among other things  the relative external concentrations of multivalent ions .",
    "accordingly , such phase transitions have long been discussed with an eye to applications such as switches , artificial muscles@xcite and metal - ion detection,@xcite or as candidate mechanisms for essential biophysical processes .",
    "@xcite as in familiar liquid - vapor transitions , some element of self - attraction is always required to drive the transition ; in gels , effective self - attractions are known to arise from relatively complicated network effects as theoretically described by flory.@xcite in fact , such network behavior is by itself rich enough to yield critical behavior with no ions present .",
    "@xcite    seeking a simplified framework for critical ionic sensitivity such as that observed in charged networks , we have recast the theory of ionic phase transitions into a solvable mean - field formulation , where we included in the theory a nonideality of debye - hckel type , which is correct in the dilute limit for all ionic solutions .",
    "we found that in principle a self - attracting network is not necessary for a discontinuous phase transition in the presence of the power - law nonideality , which itself acts as an effective self - attraction mediating an ionically driven phase transition of the gas - liquid type .",
    "our model requires us to include a self - repulsive term to avoid runaway collapse due to the non - ideal term . in biological applications ,",
    "intracellular charged proteins may play the role of confined charges , and steric exclusion among them would naturally provide the self - repulsive term . in fact@xcite charges on intracellular proteins in cells",
    "are present in densities such that debye - hckel criticality could play a role in osmotic control within organisms .    within our mean - field theory",
    ", we find that by changing the magnitude of our self - repulsive term , we can move the system through a line of critical points . in this way",
    ", criticality is in principle tunable to occur at any desired value of external divalent ion fraction .",
    "our finding of debye - hckel criticality was made in the context of ion exchange in aqueous systems,@xcite but it is in accord with established work in the context of volume - temperature transitions in charged hard - sphere fluids initiated by fisher and levin,@xcite in semiconductor electron - hole fluids , glasses , and molten salts by mcgahay and tomozawa@xcite and in neutral polyampholytes ( overall - neutral charged polymers ) by barbosa and levin.@xcite    both our simplified formulation of ionic transitions and our prediction of criticality in aqueous systems much simpler than gel networks may illuminate mechanisms of tunable critical sensitivity to ion valence or concentration that could underlie , for example , biophysical cellular functions such as homeostasis .",
    "@xcite the theory may also lend itself to engineering applications involving ion detection . for these purposes the internal electric potential @xmath0 , which we calculate ,",
    "might be a more convenient dependent parameter than volume in applications to ion detection or in biophysical roles for critical ionic sensitivity .",
    "consider a population of @xmath1 ions each of charge @xmath2 ( of either sign , in our treatment ) that may be bound to a mechanical structure , such as a polymer network , or otherwise confined within a volume permeable to counterions .",
    "these are the conditions for donnan equilibrium @xcite in which osmotic pressure of excess counterions goes hand - in - hand with an internal voltage @xmath0 , relative to outside , with the same sign as @xmath2 . even for @xmath3",
    ", neutrality holds to a good approximation whenever the voltage drop @xmath0 occurs only at the boundary , or more generally if @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the system capacitance .",
    "osmotic pressure is exerted via the electrical potential drop at the gel boundary .",
    "external concentrations of counterions may be much more dilute than the same species within the confinement volume .",
    "nonetheless , small changes in the relative concentrations of external ions of differing valence can lead to large changes in internal counterion valence ratios and thus in the internal osmotic pressure , as sketched in fig .  1 .",
    "when effective self - attraction is present in the confined - ion system , to be supplied in our case by the non - ideality of the internal solution , phase transitions in volume and a critical point analogous to that in a gas - liquid system can occur .",
    "the immobile ions , confined within a variable volume @xmath6 , have concentration @xmath7 .",
    "monovalent and divalent counterions with charges @xmath8 and @xmath9 are introduced at external concentrations @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and have within @xmath6 the concentrations @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "their free diffusion in and out is controlled by the the electrical potential @xmath0 .",
    "we introduce nonideality of mobile ions by way of a debye - hckel interaction or correlation free energy @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",
    "the essential features of @xmath16 are that it is negative and contains mobile - ion concentrations raised to the @xmath17 power .",

    "@xmath19 to obtain closed - form solutions , we omit confined ions from the sum , and replace the factor @xmath20 by @xmath21 , which will equal @xmath22 once neutrality is imposed .",
    "thus we employ the debye - hckel - like interaction term @xmath23 with @xmath12 and @xmath13 and taking derivatives , @xmath24 where activity coefficients @xmath25 and @xmath26 for the monovalent and divalent ions are defined by @xcite @xmath27 proportionality of @xmath28 to the square root of ionic concentration is the hallmark of debye - hckel behavior , a theory appropriate to low ionic strength.@xcite the free energy , with @xmath0 externally controlled , is @xmath29      +       n_b       { k_{\\text{\\tiny b}}t }       \\big [      \\ln\\frac{n_b}{c_0 v } -1      \\big ]      .\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] here @xmath30 describes mechanical constraints on the immobile ions , such as a polymer network carrying the fixed ions or a membrane containing them .",
