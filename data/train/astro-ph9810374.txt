    "the discovery that the sky distribution of faint gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) is isotropic , coupled with the confirmation of a roll - over in the cumulative brightness distribution of the bursts , suggested that the bursts lie at cosmological distances ( @xcite ) .",
    "about one year ago , the rapid dissemination of arcminute - sized grb error circles provided by the wide - field camera ( wfc ) on bepposax ( @xcite ) led to the discovery of fading x - ray ( @xcite ) and optical ( @xcite ) counterparts to the bursts .",
    "the subsequent measurement of absorption lines at @xmath5 in the spectra of the optical afterglow of grb 970508 ( @xcite ) firmly established the extra - galactic nature of this burst , and presumably , of most or all grbs .",
    "redshifts are now known for the apparent host galaxies of two other bursts : @xmath6 in the case of grb 980703 ( @xcite ) and @xmath7 in the case of grb 971214 ( @xcite ) .",
    "grb980425 has complicated this simple `` cosmological '' picture of grbs . following the detection of this burst by the bepposax gamma - ray burst monitor and wfc ( @xcite ;",
    "see also @xcite ) , x - ray follow - up observations were made using the bepposax narrow field instrument ( nfi ) ( pian et al .",
    "1998a , b ; piro et al .",
    "the initial observation revealed a faint x - ray source ( detected at the @xmath8 level ) that was not seen in several subsequent observations .",
    "optical follow - up observations led to the discovery of a supernova , sn 1998bw , within the 8 arcminute radius of the beppposax wfc error circle for the grb but not coincident with the fading x - ray source ( @xcite ) .",
    "no other optically variable object was detected within the bepposax wfc error circle for the burst .",
    "sn 1998bw was subsequently found to be of type ic ( @xcite ) and very bright in the radio ( @xcite ) .",
    "the supernova is coincident with a galaxy ( presumably the host galaxy ) that lies at @xmath9 ( @xcite ) .",
    "an association between grb 980425 and sn 1998bw is an intriguing possibility , made more so by the recent heightened interest in `` collapsar '' or `` hypernova '' models of grbs ( woosley 1993 ; woosley , eastman & schmidt 1998 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the principal argument in favor of an association between grb 980425 and sn 1998bw is the positional and temporal coincidence between the two events . given a supernova rate of @xmath10 per @xmath11 galaxy per century ( @xcite ) , a density of @xmath11 galaxies of 0.01 mpc@xmath12 , and that approximately 2/7 of these are sne of types ib",
    ", ib / c and ic ( @xcite , @xcite ) , the chance probability of such a spatial - temporal coincidence for a type ib - ic sn with @xmath13 is @xmath14 .",
    "but would an association between grb980425 and sn 1998bw be acceptable sn 1998bw were at @xmath15 rather than at @xmath16 ? almost certainly .",
    "if so , the appropriate value for the chance probability of the positional and temporal coincidence becomes @xmath17% .",
    "this illustrates how difficult it is to evaluate _ a posteriori _ statistical arguments .",
    "and there are specific reasons to be cautious in this case . assuming a power - law decay with time , and connecting the 2 - 10 kev x - ray flux detected by the bepposax wfc during and immediately following the burst , and the 2 - 10 kev x - ray flux of the fading x - ray source detected 10 hours later by the bepposax nfi , yields a power - law index of @xmath18 ( @xcite ) , which is similar to the power - law indices of the x - ray afterglows of other bepposax bursts .",
    "thus grb 980425 is more plausibly associated with this fading x - ray source than with sn 1998bw .",
    "also , if the association between grb 980425 and sn 1998bw were true , the luminosity of this burst would be @xmath19 erg s@xmath20 and its energy would be @xmath21 erg .",
    "each would therefore be five orders of magnitude less than that of other bursts , and the behavior of the x - ray and optical afterglow would be very different from those of the other bepposax bursts , yet the burst itself is indistinguishable from other bepposax and batse grbs with respect to duration , time history , spectral shape , peak flux , and and fluence ( @xcite ) .    in view of the difficulty in assessing the significance of any association between sne and grbs on the basis of this single event , the safest procedure is to regard the association as a hypothesis that is to be tested by searching for correlations between sne and grb in catalogs of sne and grbs , excluding sn 1998bw and grb980425 .",
    "wang & wheeler ( 1998 ) have performed such a study , and find evidence for a significant ( at the @xmath22 level ) correlation between type ib - ic sne and grbs detected by batse .    while the results of wang & wheeler ( 1998 ) seem promising , their study suffers from several deficiencies .",
    "the number ( six ) of type ib - ic sne in their sample is small , and one of these events is mis - classified [ sn 1992ad is a type ii sn ( @xcite ) , not a type ic sn ] , which eliminates one of their sn - grb associations . the range of possible explosion dates that we derive for another event ( sn 1997x ) is much smaller than the range they allow , which rules out another of their associations .",
    "furthermore , two other sn  grb associations are ruled out by interplanetary network positions ( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , wang & wheeler s methodology is somewhat arbitrary , in the sense that they increase the size of the batse grb positional error circles by a large , arbitrary factor .",
    "finally , wang & wheeler s methodology makes no provision for the fact that the batse temporal exposure is less than unity .",
    "in fact , their result ( six of six `` type ib - ic '' sne correlated with grbs ) is unlikely , even if the proposed association between type ib - ic sne and grbs were real , since batse has on average a probability of 0.48 of detecting any given grb because of earth blocking and other effects ( @xcite ) .    here",
    "we carry out an analysis that overcomes these deficiencies .",
    "we correct the `` type ib - ic '' sn sample of wang & wheeler ( 1998 ) and supplement it with 15 additional type ib - ic sne , so that we can study a larger sample .",
    "further , we develop an alternative method , based on bayesian inference and therefore using the likelihood function , that incorporates information about the batse position errors in a non - arbitrary way and that is free of the ambiguities of _ a posteriori _ statistics .",
    "the method also accounts the fact that the batse temporal exposure is less than unity .    applying this method to a sample of 83 type ia sne and a sample of 20 type ib - ic sne",
    ", we find overwhelming odds against the hypothesis that all type ia sne produce observable gamma - ray bursts , irrespective of whether the sne are at low- or high - redshift , and very large odds against the hypothesis that all type ib , ib / c , and ic sne produce observable gamma - ray bursts .",
    "we find large odds against the hypothesis that a fraction of type ia supernovae produce observable gamma - ray bursts , and moderate odds against the hypothesis that a fraction of type ib , ib / c , and ic supernovae produce observable bursts .",
    "we have also re - analyzed both a corrected version of the wang & wheeler sample of type ib - ic sne and our larger sample of 20 type ib - ic sne , using a generalization of their frequentist method .",
    "we find no significant evidence in either case of a correlation between type ib - ic sne and grbs , consistent with the very strong evidence against such a correlation that we find from our bayesian analysis .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in  ii we present a rigorous method , based on bayesian inference , for calculating the odds favoring the hypothesis that any particular class of astronomical transients produces grbs over the hypothesis that they do not . in ",
    "iii we apply this method to various subclasses of type i sne . in ",
    "iv we discuss our results , and compare them with other work .",
    "we present our conclusions in  v.",
    "we denote the data by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the number of observed sne . for",
    "the @xmath25th observed sn , the data consists of the sn position @xmath26 ( a unit vector ) , the earliest time @xmath27 at which the sn explosion could have occurred , the duration @xmath28 of the period of time during which the sn explosion could have occurred , the number @xmath29 of grbs that occurred during the time interval @xmath30 $ ] , and the list @xmath31 of batse positions and error parameters for those bursts .",
    "thus , @xmath32 .",
    "note that the @xmath33 are fisher distribution parameters , _ not _ the batse - style 68% error - circle radii .",
    "they enter the odds calculation through the assumption that an observed burst position @xmath34 is distributed around its true position @xmath35 according to the fisher distribution    @xmath36\\\\ \\kappa&\\equiv&\\left[2\\pi\\sigma^2\\left(1-e^{-2/\\sigma^2}\\right)\\right]^{-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    ( see , for example @xcite , p. 228 ) .",
    "the @xmath37 are related to the 68% total errors ( including correction for systematic error ) by the linear relation @xmath38 .",
    "we compare two hypotheses :    @xmath39 : the association between sne and grbs is real .",
    "if a sn is observed , there is a chance @xmath40 that batse sees the associated grb , where @xmath40 is the average batse temporal exposure .",
    "while @xmath40 varies with declination , the variation is modest and we neglect it .",
    "the probability density for the time of occurrence of the @xmath25th supernova is assumed uniform in the interval @xmath30 $ ] , so that all grbs that occur in that interval have an equal prior probability of being associated with the sn .",
    "@xmath41 : there is no association between sne and grbs .",
    "we wish to calculate the odds favoring @xmath39 over @xmath41 , given the data .",
    "that is , we want @xmath42 where we have set the prior probabilities @xmath43 , and we have assumed the statistical independence of all the @xmath44 .",
    "the symbol @xmath45 is shorthand for all the available prior information .    from equation ( [ odds1 ] )",
    ", it is apparent that @xmath46 is equal to the likelihood ratio .",
    "a simplification that occurs here is that our hypotheses @xmath39 and @xmath41 are simple  they are not parametrized families of models . as a consequence , the likelihoods @xmath47 are not `` global '' likelihoods , averaged over parameter space weighted by a prior density , as is common in odds ratio calculations ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "rather , they are genuine likelihoods , the computation of which requires no prior probability density over parameter space .",
    "we now compute the likelihoods for a model in which all type ib - ic sne produce grbs . under the no - association hypothesis @xmath41 , we have @xmath48 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{4\\pi}\\right)^{n_i } , \\label{ph2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the differential rate for observing such sne , @xmath50 is the differential rate for observing a batse grb positional error @xmath37 , @xmath51 is the differential probability of @xmath29 isotropic grb positions , and @xmath52 is the time rate at which batse observes grbs .",
    "it is unnecessary to specify @xmath53 and @xmath54 in greater detail , since they are the same under @xmath39 as under @xmath41 , so that they cancel in the odds .    under the association hypothesis @xmath39",
    ", we must take into account the possibility that the grb associated with the @xmath25th sn may not have been detected by batse as a consequence of incomplete temporal exposure .",
    "we denote by @xmath55 the proposition that batse was exposed to the direction of the sn when it occurred , and by @xmath56 the negation of @xmath55 .",
    "then , @xmath57 now , if batse was not exposed to the sn , then the @xmath29 observed grbs are purely coincidental , and the probability for observing them is the same as it would be if @xmath41 held instead of @xmath39 : @xmath58 the second term in equation ( [ ph1 ] ) is @xmath59    denoting by @xmath60 the proposition that the @xmath61th grb is associated with the @xmath25th sn , we have @xmath62 } { 2\\pi{\\ensuremath{\\sigma_{ij}}}^2\\left(1-e^{-2/{\\ensuremath{\\sigma_{ij}}}^2}\\right ) } , \\label{alik}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used the assumed equality of the prior probabilities @xmath63 , as well as the fisher distribution for the position of the grb associated with the sn .",
    "combining equations ( [ expo ] ) and ( [ alik ] ) , we obtain @xmath64 } { 2\\pi{\\ensuremath{\\sigma_{ij}}}^2\\left(1-e^{-2/{\\ensuremath{\\sigma_{ij}}}^2}\\right ) } \\nonumber\\\\ & = & p(d_i|h_2,i)\\times\\frac{1}{r\\tau_i } \\times \\sum_{j=1}^{n_i}\\frac{\\exp\\left[({\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{y}_{ij}}}\\cdot{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{x}_i}}-1)/{\\ensuremath{\\sigma_{ij}}}^2\\right ] } { \\frac{1}{2}{\\ensuremath{\\sigma_{ij}}}^2\\left(1-e^{-2/{\\ensuremath{\\sigma_{ij}}}^2}\\right)}. \\label{expo2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] finally , inserting equations ( [ expo2 ] ) and ( [ h1h2 ] ) into equation ( [ ph1 ] ) , and combining the result with equation ( [ odds1 ] ) , we obtain the following expression for the odds : @xmath65 } { \\frac{1}{2}{\\ensuremath{\\sigma_{ij}}}^2\\left(1-e^{-2/{\\ensuremath{\\sigma_{ij}}}^2}\\right)}\\right\\}\\nonumber\\\\ & \\equiv&\\prod_{i=1}^{n_{\\mathrm{sn}}}{\\ensuremath{\\mathcal{o}}}_i . \\label{odds2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] some of the properties of this expression for @xmath46 are worth pointing out :    the term proportional to the average temporal exposure @xmath40 contains a sum over candidate grb counterparts to the sn . each term in the sum consists of an exponential term that can penalize a candidate grb counterpart for excessive angular distance from the position of the sn , and a denominator that can reward a candidate counterpart for having a small error circle .",
    "thus , a grb with a small error circle that is not far from the position of the sn can produce a large term in the sum .",
    "a grb whose error circle is very far from the sn will produce an inconspicuous term in the sum , as will a grb with a very large error circle , irrespective of its position .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath40 is also inversely proportional to @xmath66 , the expected number of grbs observed by batse during the interval @xmath28 .",
    "this term prevents the expression for @xmath67 from becoming large as a consequence of a large @xmath68 resulting in one or more grbs coinciding with the sn position purely by chance .",
    "in fact , we see that each term in the sum is inversely proportional to @xmath69 , a quantity that estimates the number of bursts whose error circles bracket the sn by chance .",
    "finally , there the term @xmath70 .",
    "this term is an `` escape hatch '' , allowing for the possibility that all of the candidate grb counterparts are terrible fits because the actual counterpart was missed due to incomplete temporal exposure .",
    "this term has an interesting consequence : while a well - correlated individual sn - grb pair may produce a large @xmath67 , the lack of such a pair can not in general produce a tiny @xmath67 if @xmath40 is not close to unity .",
    "thus , no _ individual _ sn can rule out the hypothesized association .",
    "however , @xmath39 may still be convincingly be ruled out if we have a collection of many sne , the great majority of which have no plausible grb counterpart , since in that case we will have @xmath71 , which can be small .",
    "the interpretation of the numerical value of @xmath46 is straightforward : if @xmath72 then the evidence favors @xmath39 . if @xmath73 , the evidence favors @xmath41 . if @xmath74 , then the evidence is insufficient to make a decisive case either way .",
    "note that @xmath75 as @xmath76 .",
    "in other words , in the limit of no grb observations at all , the evidence becomes insufficient to budge the odds from the assigned prior value @xmath77 .",
    "a similarly plausible limiting behavior of the odds is @xmath78 , which may be derived by considering the expected number of grbs whose error circles bracket the sn by chance in the long run .",
    "thus , in the limit of a total lack of knowledge about the epoch of the sn explosion , the proliferation of candidate grb counterparts introduces noise that swamps our ability to distinguish between the two hypotheses .",
    "it is also worth pointing out that this expression for the odds bears some resemblance to the odds favoring the association of grbs with host galaxies derived by band & hartmann ( 1998 ) .",
    "that work also compared two `` simple '' hypotheses  either grbs have ( intensity - redshift correlated ) host galaxies , or they do nt .",
    "their expression for the odds ( equation [ 5 ] of band & hartmann 1998 ) bears a structural resemblance to our equation ( [ odds2 ] ) , including a sum over possible counterpart galaxies and a term accounting for the possibility that the host galaxy was not observed because its luminosity was below the detection threshold .",
    "the main difference is that in their study , grbs play the role that sne play in ours , with their grb error circles replacing our uncertainty in the time of the sn explosion , and with the fraction of galaxies above the detection threshold replacing the batse exposure .",
    "there are two useful generalizations of this method : we can add interplanetary network ( ipn ) annuli to the data when they are available , and we can consider a more general model in which not all sne produce detectable grbs .",
    "the inclusion of ipn annuli in the data is straightforward .",
    "the ipn catalog ( @xcite ) gives the orientation of the line joining two burst - detecting spacecraft , the angle @xmath79 between this direction and the direction to the burst ( which is the angular radius of the ipn annulus ) , and a 3-@xmath37 error in this angle , which we denote by @xmath80 .",
    "thus @xmath79 is the angular radius and @xmath80 is the angular width of the ipn annulus .",
    "analogously , we define @xmath81 as the angle between the line joining two burst - detecting spacecraft and the @xmath25th sn , and @xmath82 as the angle between the line joining two burst - detecting spacecraft and the @xmath61th burst possibly associated with this sn .",
    "we assume that under @xmath39 , @xmath83 has a gaussian distribution with mean @xmath84 and error @xmath85 ( with @xmath86 in radians ) .",
    "we also assume that under @xmath41 , @xmath83 is distributed uniformly in the range @xmath87 $ ] .",
    "when an ipn annulus is available , we replace the batse position by the annulus in the data set .",
    "it is not difficult to show that the odds for an individual sn then become @xmath88 where @xmath89}{\\displaystyle\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma_{ij}/2 } & \\mbox{ipn annulus available , } \\\\",
    "\\frac{\\displaystyle\\exp\\left[({\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{y}_{ij}}}\\cdot{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{x}_i}}-1)/{\\ensuremath{\\sigma_{ij}}}^2\\right ] } { \\displaystyle\\frac{1}{2}{\\ensuremath{\\sigma_{ij}}}^2\\left(1-e^{-2/{\\ensuremath{\\sigma_{ij}}}^2}\\right ) } & \\mbox{otherwise } \\end{array}\\right .",
    "\\label{li } } \\ ] ] the overall odds are still given by the product of the individual odds .",
    "we may generalize @xmath39 to a model @xmath90 in which only a fraction @xmath53 of sne produce observable grbs .",
    "this may be due to beaming , or for some other reason .",
    "the necessary modification of the above formulas is straightforward .",
    "we assume a uniform prior density for @xmath53 in the range @xmath91 $ ] .",
    "the odds favoring model @xmath90 over model @xmath41 are denoted by @xmath92 , and given by the expression @xmath93 where @xmath94 in other words , @xmath95 is constructed by setting the effective probability of observing a grb associated with a sn to @xmath96 , rather than to @xmath40 .",
    "the quantity @xmath92 can help us decide whether hypothesis @xmath90 or @xmath41 is favored by the evidence .",
    "if we were to find that @xmath90 is strongly favored , we could then attempt to estimate likely values for @xmath53 . for this purpose , we may use the posterior probability density for @xmath53 , given by @xmath97 we may construct a point estimate for @xmath53 by locating the maximum of @xmath98 , and we may obtain interval estimates for @xmath53 by finding intervals that contain a prescribed amount of probability  68% , say  as calculated by integrating @xmath98 .    the quantity @xmath92 is subject to an ambiguity : it is dependent upon our choice of prior probability density for @xmath53 . if instead of a uniform prior density for @xmath53 in the range @xmath91 $ ] we had chosen , for example , a uniform prior density in the range @xmath99 $ ] ( with @xmath100 ) , then the expression for @xmath92 given in equation ( [ oprime ] ) would be increased by a factor of @xmath101 .",
    "thus , a model that predicts small values of @xmath53 might find the comparison with data less damaging than a model that is agnostic about the value of @xmath53 .",
    "however , with @xmath98 in hand , we may , if we wish , take a different approach to the assessment of the plausibility of @xmath90 . instead of calculating the odds",
    ", we may calculate a @xmath102 upper bound for @xmath53 .",
    "the dependence of this upper bound on the number of sne in the sample may be calculated approximately as follows :    assuming @xmath53 is in fact small , so that not many coincidences are observed , then the dependence of @xmath98 on @xmath53 is seen from equation ( [ of ] ) to be approximately @xmath103 after normalizing this expression , we may integrate it to produce the cumulative probability : @xmath104 the quantity @xmath105 is the significance level of our upper limit , say 99.73%",
    ". we may solve equation ( [ qf ] ) for @xmath106 , obtaining @xmath107^{1/n_{\\mathrm{sn}}+1}\\right\\}. \\label{fq}\\ ] ] the dependence of @xmath108 on @xmath24 is plotted in figure [ fqplot ] .",
    "it is evident from the figure that even assuming maximum exposure , the 3-@xmath37 upper limit on @xmath53 can only be expected to decrease very slowly with @xmath24 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that for large @xmath24 , the behavior of @xmath108 is @xmath109 . given the form of this dependence on @xmath24 , and given the relatively low rate ( @xmath110 yr@xmath20 ) at which type ib - ic sne are currently being discovered , it does not seem likely that observational evidence can constrain @xmath53 in a significant manner anytime soon .",
    "we now apply the above methodology to the question of whether or not the odds favor the hypothesis that a particular class of type i sne produce grbs over the hypothesis that they do not .",
    "we first discuss the samples of grbs and type i sne that we use to address this question .",
    "the sample of grbs that we use in our analysis consists of the batse 4b catalog ( @xcite , http://www.batse.msfc.nasa.gov/data/grb/4bcatalog/ ) , and batse bursts that occurred subsequent to the 4b catalog but before 1 may 1998 ( http://www.batse.msfc.nasa.gov/data/grb/catalog/ ) .",

    "hurley ( private communication , 1998 ) has kindly made available at our request 3rd ipn annuli for an additional 9 batse bursts that occurred subsequent to the period of the batse 4b catalog but before 1 may 1998 .",
    "we have compiled three type i sne samples .",
    "the first is a sample of 37 type ia sne ( see table 1 ) at low redshift ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "the data for most of these events were kindly provided to us by the cfa sn search team ( riess 1998 , private communication ) .",
    "the second is a sample of 46 moderate redshift ( @xmath112 ) type ia sne ( see table 2 ) .",
    "the supernova cosmology project ( scp ) kindly supplied the data for nearly all of these events ( perlmutter 1998 , private communication ) .",
    "the third sample consists of 20 type ib , ib / c , and ic sne ( see table 3 ) .",
    "we have compiled the data for these last events from information available in the iau circulars and in various sne catalogs ( see the footnotes to table 3 ) .",

    "the explosion date using the formula : @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the estimated or observed date of maximum light and @xmath116 is the redshift of the sn . the uncertainty in the date of maximum light is taken to be @xmath1171d for the cfa data supplied by riess .",
    "in the sixteen cases where the date of maximum light has been interpreted from spectra of the sn , we assign a greater uncertainty to the date of maximum light . when the language associated with the spectral dating describes the observation as having been made near maximum light , we adopt @xmath1176d for the uncertainty in the date of maximum light .",

    "the uncertainty assigned by the scp to the explosion date is @xmath1172.5d , which we have rounded up to @xmath1173d for simplicity ( see table 2 ) .",

    "@xmath113 are found by the same procedure as for the low-@xmath116 , type ia sample .",
    "when this method yields a range of possible explosion dates that extends beyond the discovery date of the sn event , we take the end of the range to be the discovery date .",
    "similarly , we limit the beginning of the range of possible explosion dates when it extends to a date earlier than the latest date on which an image was taken that does not show the sn event .",
    "we make the conservative assumption the the explosion occurred no earlier than two days prior to the image date .",

    "sn 1998 t increased in brightness between two successive photometric observations ( @xcite ) , while a spectrum taken of sn 1998cc showed features indicating that the sn had not yet reached maximum light ( @xcite ) .",
    "again , we are conservative and take the date of these observations to be the earliest possible date of maximum light . consequently , the earliest possible explosion date for each sn is 17 days prior to the pre - maximum observation ( @xmath122 = 15d for a type ib sn plus 2d for the uncertainty in the rise time predicted by explosion models ) . the latest possible explosion date for these events",
    "is taken to be the discovery date ( see table 3 ) .",
    "our sample of twenty type ib , ib / c and ic sne includes five of the six sne considered by wang & wheeler ( 1998 ) ; the sixth ( sn 1992ad ) is a type ii sn ( @xcite ) that was mis - classified as a type ic sn by wang & wheeler . in two of the remaining five cases ,",
    "the range of possible explosion dates @xmath113 that we derive agrees closely with theirs ; in the other three cases they do not . in the case of sn 1996n , the beginning of the range of possible",
    "explosion dates that we adopt is similar to that of wang & wheeler ( 1998 ) , but the end of the range is two weeks later . in the case of sn 1997ei , the range of possible explosion dates that we adopt is of the same duration as that of wang & wheeler ( 1998 ) , but shifted later by one month .",
    "the differences between our and wang & wheeler s ranges of possible explosion dates for sn 1996n and sn 1997ei do not affect our results .",
    "however , in the third case ( sn 1997x ) , our range of possible explosion dates begins 14@xmath123 later than theirs because it is limited by the existence of an image that shows no evidence of the sn ( @xcite ) ; as a result , the grb that they associate with sn 1997x is excluded by the revised range of possible explosion dates , and this makes a modest difference in our results ( see below ) .    finally , wang & wheeler ( 1998 ) list sn 1997ef in their table 1 , but do not classify it and therefore do not include it in their analysis .",
    "we are able to classify it as a type ic sn ( @xcite ) and we include it in our analysis ( see tables 3 and 4 ) ; the range of possible explosion dates we derive for this sn is shifted later by about one month relative to that given by wang & wheeler ( 1998 ) .",
    "we first apply our methodology to the 83 events in our sample of type ia sne .",
    "since it is not expected that type ia sne can produce grbs , these events constitute a `` control '' sample .",
    "the results we find for this sample illustrate the power of the methodology .",
    "we find overwhelming odds ( @xmath124 ) against the hypothesis that all type ia sne produce observable grbs ( see table 5 ) .",

    "these results are not unexpected , given that an association between type ia sne is deemed unlikely on theoretical grounds and no observational evidence has been reported linking the two .",
    "thus , the type ia sne constitute a control sample , validating the methodology we have developed , and illustrating that , even with a batse mean temporal exposure efficiency of @xmath129 , a sne sample of moderate size is sufficient to provide a severe test of the hypothesis that all type ia sne produce observable grbs , and a strong test of the hypothesis that a fraction @xmath127 do .      applying our methodology to our sample of 20 type ib - ic sne",

    "these limits are relatively weak because of the modest size ( 20 events ) of our sample of type ib - ic sne .    in order to verify that our results are insensitive to the range of possible explosion dates @xmath113 that we have derived , we repeated our analysis of the sample of type ib , ib / c and ic sne with @xmath113 increased by @xmath117 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , and 10 days , except when the beginning of the range is limited by an image that does not show the sn or the end of the range is limited by the sn discovery date .",
    "the resulting odds vary little ( see figure 1 ) , demonstrating the robustness of our conclusions .",
    "we have applied a methodology based bayesian inference to a sample of 83 type ia sne .",

    "if we nevertheless assume that this hypothesis is correct , we find that the fraction @xmath127 of type ib , ib / c and ic sne that produce observable grbs is less than 0.70 with 99.7% probability .",
    "this limit is relatively weak because of the modest size ( 20 events ) of our sample of type ib - ic sne .",
    "type ib , ib / c and ic sne are now being found at a rate of about eight a year , so that the size of the sample of known type ib - ic sne should double within three years and triple within about five years .",
    "one might hope that future analyses , using the statistical methodology that we have presented here , could either show that the association between type ib - ic sne and grbs is rare , or confirm the proposed association .",
    "unfortunately , equation ( 18 ) and figure 2 show that achieving the former will be difficult : the limit on the fraction @xmath127 of type ib - ic sne that produce observable grbs scales like @xmath130 for large @xmath131 , and therefore tripling the size of the sample of known type ib - ic sne without observing an additional possible sn ",
    "grb association would only reduce the 99.7% probability upper limit on @xmath127 to 0.24 .",
    "an alternative approach is to use the upper limit on the fraction of batse bursts that can have come from a homogeneous , isotropic distribution to place an upper limit on the fraction of nearby type ib - ic sne that can have produced observable grbs .",
    "we infer from smith & lamb ( 1993 ) that no more than roughly 20% of the batse burst can have come from such a population , corresponding to @xmath132 bursts during the @xmath133 years covered by our study .",
    "grb 980425 had a 1024 msec peak flux @xmath134 photons @xmath135 s@xmath20 , which is less than a factor of four above the batse threshold .",
    "consequently , assuming that the association between sn 1998bw and grb 980425 is real and that the grbs produced by type ib - ic sne are standard candles , batse only detects type ib - ic sne that lie at redshifts smaller than @xmath136 .",
    "this is a sampling distance of @xmath137  mpc .",
    "given a supernova rate of @xmath10 per @xmath11 galaxy per century ( @xcite ) , a density of @xmath11 galaxies of @xmath138  mpc@xmath12 , and that approximately 2/7 of these are sne of types ib , ib / c and ic ( @xcite , @xcite ) , we find that during the @xmath133 years covered by our study , the number of sne that occurred and could have produced grb detectable by batse is 185 .",
    "given the batse average temporal exposure @xmath129 , this implies that at most @xmath139 such sne could have been detected by batse . comparing this number with the number @xmath132 of grbs that can have come from such a population , we derive an upper limit on the fraction of type ib - ic sne that can have produced an observable grb of @xmath140 .",
    "this means that no constraint may be placed on @xmath141 by this method , and shows that the method used in the present study , as opposed to modeling of the batse angular and brightness distributions , provides the more stringent constraint .",
    "one can also approach the proposed association between sne and grbs from the opposite direction .",
    "the interesting question , from this point of view , is what fraction @xmath142 of the grbs detected by batse could have been produced by type ib - ic sne ?",
    "the above discussion indicates that @xmath142 can be no more than @xmath143 , where in the last step we have used the 99.7% probability upper limit derived from our bayesian analysis .",
    "this question can also be addressed by examining relatively accurate ( @xmath144 ) grb positional error circles for the presence of type ib - ic sne .",
    "bepposax observations have already placed a weak limit on this fraction : setting aside grb 980425 , none of the remaining 14 bepposax wfc grb error circles has been found to contain a type ib - ic sn .",
    "the hete - ii mission is expected to place somewhat stronger limits on this fraction ( or possibly confirm the proposed association between grbs and type ib - ic sne ) , since it is expected to provide a larger number of relatively accurate positions for grbs .",
    "the limit @xmath145 that can be placed on the fraction @xmath146 of grbs that can have been produced by sne is given by equation ( 18 ) , with the number of sne , @xmath131 , replaced by the number of grbs , @xmath147 , and @xmath40 set equal to one ( we assume that the efficiency of detecting a type ib - ic sn in a relatively accurate grb positional error circle is 100% ) . thus the dashed curve in figure 2 shows this limit as a function of @xmath147 .",
    "equation ( 18 ) and figure 2 show that this limit scales as @xmath148 for large @xmath147 , as one intuitively expects .",
    "consequently , placing a 99.7% upper limit on @xmath142 that is more stringent than the rough limit derived above , or confirming the proposed association between grbs and type ib - ic sne if such associations are rare , will require a mission that produces relatively accurate ( @xmath144 ) positions for a very large number ( @xmath149 ) of grbs .",
    "wang & wheeler ( 1998 ) have reported that analysis of a sample of six type ib - ic sne using an _ a posteriori _ frequentist statistic rules out at the @xmath22 significance level the null hypothesis that the positions on the sky of type ib , ib / c , and ic sne and grbs are uncorrelated .",
    "the statistic they used is the probability that at least one of the batse positional error circles for the grbs occurring within the range of possible explosion dates @xmath150 of a type ib - ic sn includes the position of the sn .    in order to understand the apparent discrepancy between our results and those of wang & wheeler ( 1998 ) , we have re - analyzed their sample of type ib - ic sne , except for the elimination of sn1992ad ( which is a type ii sn , not a type ic as wang & wheeler assumed ) , and corrections to their ranges of possible explosion dates .",
    "we use a generalization of their methodology that is applicable to a sample in which not all of the sne are bracketed by a grb error circle .",
    "we have also applied this generalization of their methodology to our larger sample of 20 type ib - ic sne .",

    "we assume the power - law model of batse systematic errors ( @xcite ) and combine these systematic errors with the batse statistical errors to produce a total 1-@xmath37 error circle radius for each burst .",

    "note that @xmath153 is _ larger _ than the `` 3-@xmath37 '' ( 99.7% probability ) error circle radius , which would be obtained by multiplying the 68.3% radius by 2.27 - as may be inferred from the @xmath154 distribution with two degrees of freedom .",

    "\\label{fi}\\ ] ] wang & wheeler ( 1998 ) asserted that the positions of all six of the sne in their sample were bracketed by the positional error circles of at least one grb , and employed a probability that was simply the product of all their @xmath151 . in the more general case in which not all the sn are bracketed",
    ", one can not apply their procedure , or even merely multiply by @xmath151 for each bracketed sn and by @xmath156 for each non - bracketed sn .",
    "the reason this latter procedure fails is that it is guaranteed to produce a small number  irrespective of whether or not many sn were bracketed  because the product of many numbers that lie between zero and one can be small , even if most of them lie near one .",
    "the problem is that by calculating the probability that _ this _ sn should be bracketed and _ that _ one should not be , we are inquiring after a peculiar state of the data , rather than a generic one .",
    "the distinction is analogous to the distinction between microstates and macrostates in statistical mechanics .",
    "we should instead calculate the probability of some generic feature of the observed data .",
    "we choose the number @xmath157 of bracketed sn as our generic property , and calculate the probability that the observed number of bracketed sn should have been @xmath158 or higher .",
    "obviously , there are many contributing configurations @xmath159 in which @xmath157 of the @xmath160 assume the values @xmath151 , and the remainder assume the value @xmath156 .",
    "we must sum over the contribution of all such configurations .",
    "our significance is then given by @xmath161 for the modified wang & wheeler sample ( sn1994i , sn1996n , sn1997x , sn1997ei , and sn1998 t ) , we find that all but sn1997x are bracketed by a grb in the explosion time window .",

    "moreover , using a sample of type ib , ib / c and ic sne that is four times larger , we find that the significance becomes even weaker  not stronger , as would be expected if the association were real . we conclude that a frequentist analysis similar to that performed by wang & wheeler ( 1998 ) shows no evidence for an association between type ib - ic sne and grbs , consistent with the very strong evidence against such a correlation that we find from our bayesian analysis .",
    "kippen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have approached the proposed association between sne and grbs from the opposite direction .",
    "they have asked the question , what fraction of batse bursts can have been produced by _ known _ sne ?",
    "they find no evidence of any correlation between sne and batse bursts , and derive a 3-@xmath37 ( 99.7% ) limit on any such fraction of 1.5% , which corresponds to @xmath165 bursts .",
    "unfortunately , this result is not very interesting because known sne comprise such a small fraction ( @xmath166 ) of the sne that occurred during the time interval they study .",
    "this , together with our earlier result that the fraction of batse bursts that could be produced by sne is @xmath167 3% , implies that a negligible fraction ( @xmath168 ) of batse bursts could be produced by _ known _ sne .",
    "kippen et al.s result is further weakened by the fact that their study does not distinguish among type ii , type ia , and type ib - ic sne , whereas it is only the last type of sne that are thought possibly to produce grbs .",
    "we find very large odds against the hypothesis that all type ib - ic sne produce observable grbs , and moderate odds against the hypothesis that a fraction of type ib - ic supernovae produce observable grbs .",
    "we have also re - analyzed a corrected version of the wang & wheeler ( 1998 ) sample of type ib - ic sne , as well as our larger sample of 20 type ib - ic sne , using a generalization of their frequentist method .",
    "we find no significant evidence of a correlation between type ib - ic sne and grbs in either case , consistent with the very strong evidence against such a correlation that we find from our bayesian analysis .",
    "while these statistical studies can not address the question of whether a particular grb is produced by a particular type ib - ic sne ( i.e. , grb 980425 by sn 1998bw ) , they show not only that there is no evidence of an association between type ib - ic sne and grbs , but that the odds against the hypothesis that all type ib - ic sne produce observable grbs are very large , and the odds against the hypothesis that a fraction of them do are moderate . these results suggest that considerable caution is warranted before accepting the association between grb 980425 and sn 1998bw .",
    "this is particularly the case , given that there exists in the bepposax wfc error circle a fading x - ray source whose behavior is consistent with the power - law temporal decline observed for the x - ray afterglows of other bepposax bursts ( @xcite ) .",
