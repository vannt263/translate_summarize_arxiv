    "than real - time dynamic simulation can predict the dynamic system response to disturbances based on which the evaluation and analysis of outages including cascading blackouts @xcite@xcite can be performed and effective corrective actions can be identified @xcite .",
    "however , large - scale power system dynamic simulation can involve several thousand state variables , and a detailed modeling of the whole system can lead to formidable computational burden .",
    "dynamic model reduction , also known as dynamic equivalencing , is an effective approach for improving calculation efficiency and finally achieving faster than real - time simulation and control by reducing the external area to be a lower - order simpler model @xcite .",
    "although the stability study by dynamic simulation is to determine the dynamic response of the generators and control systems in a study area under disturbances inside the area , these disturbances will impact the neighboring area ( called the external area ) , which in turn will impact the study area , due to the interconnected nature of large power systems .    for model reduction ,",
    "the study area is of interest and therefore is modeled in detail , while the external area is not of direct interest and thus can be reduced and replaced with a simpler mathematical description . physically based coherency model reduction has been extensively studied @xcite@xcite ; it first identifies coherency of generators and then performs reduction by aggregating the coherent generators .",
    "the performance of this method mainly depends on the identification of coherent generators .",
    "when system conditions change , it might be necessary to adjust the existing boundary to accurately capture the dynamic characteristics of the system @xcite , @xcite .",
    "other approaches , such as synchrony @xcite , singular perturbations @xcite , selective modal analysis @xcite , and computation intelligence methods @xcite have also been developed .",
    "there are also model reduction techniques based on the moment matching methods @xcite@xcite , which attempt to make the leading coefficients of a power series expansion of the reduced system s transfer function match those of the original system transfer function .",
    "another model reduction approach from the perspective of input - output properties has also been studied , such as balanced truncation @xcite and structured model reduction based on an extension balanced truncation @xcite .",
    "compared with coherency - based methods , these methods have a stronger theoretical foundation and are more general , not specially targeted to a particular application @xcite .    besides , recently some new methods have also been developed , such as measurement - based model reduction @xcite@xcite , border synchrony based method @xcite , ann - based boundary matching technique @xcite , independent component analysis approach @xcite , heuristic optimization based approach @xcite , @xcite , and approximate bisimulation - based method @xcite . for detailed survey of the model reduction methods in power systems ,",

    "the external system has to be linearized .",
    "because of the strong nonlinearity of power systems , linearization - based methods can not always provide accurate description of the physical system . in this paper , however , we discuss model reduction directly for nonlinear power systems through balanced truncation based on empirical controllability and observability covariances @xcite@xcite . this method has been discussed in @xcite@xcite where it has been applied to mechanical systems @xcite , @xcite and chemical systems @xcite , @xcite . on one hand , similar to the balanced truncation method based on a linearized model , the proposed method also has a solid theoretical foundation and thus holds promise for application to large systems . on the other hand ,",
    "the proposed method is expected to be able to perform more accurate model reduction by using the empirical controllability and observability covariances . unlike analysis based on linearization , for which the controllability and observability only work locally in a neighborhood of an operating point , the empirical covariances are defined using the original system model and can thus reflect the controllability and observability of the full nonlinear dynamics in the given domain .    the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",

    "in this paper , a nonlinear power system model reduction method is proposed by balancing of the empirical controllability and observability covariances .",
    "compared with the balanced truncation method based on a linearized model , the proposed model reduction method can guarantee higher accuracy for simulated state trajectory , mainly because the empirical covariances are defined using the original system model and can thus reflect the controllability and observability of the full nonlinear dynamics in the given domain .",
