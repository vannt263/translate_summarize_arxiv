    "the main theorem we prove in this paper is    [ thm1 ] the bilinear hilbert transform along the curve @xmath3 can be extended to a bounded operator from @xmath0 to @xmath1 .",
    "it can be shown , with a little modification of our method , that the bilinear hilbert transforms along polynomial curves @xmath7 are bounded from @xmath8 to @xmath9 whenever @xmath10 is in the closed convex hull of @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "this problem is motivated by the hilbert transform along a curve @xmath14 defined by @xmath15 and the bilinear hilbert transform defined by @xmath16 among various curves , one simple model case is the parabola @xmath17 in the two dimensional plane .",
    "this work was initiated by fabes and riviere @xcite in order to study the regularity of parabolic differential equations . in the last thirty years",
    ", considerable work on this type of problems had been done . a nice survey on this type of operators",
    "was written by stein and wainger @xcite .",
    "for the curves on homogeneous nilpotent lie groups , the @xmath18 estimates were established by christ @xcite .",
    "the work for the hilbert transform along more general curves with certain geometric conditions such as the `` flat '' case can be found in christ , duoandikoetxea and j. l. rubio de francia , and nagel , vance , wainger and weinberg s papers @xcite .",
    "the general results were established recently in @xcite for the singular radon transforms and their maximal analogues over smooth submanifolds of @xmath19 with some curvature conditions .",
    "+ in recent years there has been a very active trend of harmonic analysis using time - frequency analysis to deal with multi - linear operators . a breakthrough on the bilinear hilbert transform",
    "was made by lacey and thiele @xcite . following lacey and thiele s work ,",
    "the field of multi - linear operators has been actively developed , to the point that some of the most interesting open questions have a strong connection to some kind of non - abelian analysis .",
    "for instance , the tri - linear hilbert transform @xmath20 has a hidden quadratic modulation symmetry which must be accounted for in any proposed method of analysis .",
    "this non - abelian character is explicit in the work of b.  kra and b.  host @xcite who characterize the characteristic factor of the corresponding ergodic averages @xmath21 here , @xmath22 is a measure preserving system , @xmath23 is the sigma - field which describes the characteristic factor . in this case",
    ", it arises from certain @xmath24-step nilpotent groups .",
    "the limit above is in the sense of @xmath25-norm convergence , and holds for all bounded @xmath26 .",
    "the ergodic analog of the bilinear hilbert transform along a parabola is the non - conventional bi - linear average @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the profinite factor , a subgroup of the maximal abelian factor of @xmath29 .",
    "the proof of the characteristic factor result above , due to furstenberg @xcite , utilizes the characteristic factor for the three - term result .",
    "we are indebted to m. lacey for bringing furstenberg s theorems to our attention . however , a notable fact is that our proof for the bilinear hilbert transform along a monimial curve does not have to go through the tri - linear hilbert transform .",
    "the proof provided in this article heavily relies on the concept of `` quadratic '' uniformity and some kind of `` quadratic '' fourier analysis , initiated by gowers @xcite . and",
    "perhaps this is a starting point to understand the tri - linear hilbert transform . +",
    "another prominent theme is the relation of the bilinear hilbert transforms along curves and the multilinear oscillatory integrals .",
    "the bilinear hilbert transforms along curves are closely associated to the multilinear oscillatory integrals of the following type .",
    "@xmath30 where @xmath31 is a unit ball in @xmath32 , @xmath33 are vectors in @xmath32 , and the phase function @xmath34 satisfies a non - degenerate condition @xmath35 here @xmath36 s are unit vectors orthogonal to @xmath37 s respectively . for a polynomial phase @xmath34 with the non - degenerate condition ( [ nondegcond ] ) , it was proved in @xcite that @xmath38 holds for some positive number @xmath39 . for the particular vectors @xmath37 s and the non - degenerate phase @xmath34 encountered in our problem , an estimate similar to ( [ linftyest ] ) still holds",
    "however , one of the main difficulties arises from the falsity of @xmath40 decay estimates for the trilinear form @xmath41 . in order to overcome this difficulty",
    ", we end up introducing the `` quadratic '' uniformity , which plays a role of a `` bridge '' connecting two spaces @xmath40 and @xmath42 . +",
    "the method used in this paper essentially works for those curves on nilpotent groups .",
    "it is possible to extend theorem [ thm1 ] to the general setting of nilpotent lie groups .",
    "but we will not pursue this in this article .",
    "there are some related questions one can pose . besides the generalisation to the more general curves , it is natural to ask the corresponding problems in higher dimensional cases and/or in multi - linear cases .",
    "for instance , in the tri - linear case , one can consider @xmath43 here @xmath44 are polynomials of @xmath45 .",
    "the investigation of such problems will be discussed in subsequent papers .",
