    "the young ( @xmath1 old ) supernova remnant ( snr ) cassiopeia  a ( cas  a ) is a unique astrophysical laboratory for studying high - energy phenomena in snrs because of its brightness across the entire electromagnetic spectrum from radio ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to very - high - energy gamma - rays @xcite . while the x - ray emission of cas  a below 3 kev is dominated by line emissions from the thin thermal plasma of the shocked ejecta , as demonstrated by observations with",
    "@xcite , a prominent nonthermal tail is known to be present and dominant above 10 kev @xcite .",
    "nonthermal x - rays appear to be emitted mainly from fragmented filaments or knots in reverse - shocked regions .",
    "the bulk of the hard x - ray emission in 1012 kev from cas  a comes from such components ; the total emission in the outer peripheral filaments found by _",
    "@xcite is only a small fraction of the total 46 kev continuum flux @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of the nonthermal component in reverse - shocked ejecta remains an open issue ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this letter",
    ", we present the analysis of multi - epoch _ chandra _ imaging and spectrometric data of cas  a. this work was motivated by our recent discovery of time variability in the synchrotron x - ray emission of snr rx  j1713.7@xmath03946 @xcite , where the year - scale time variability requires , most likely , the presence of a largely amplified magnetic field of 1  mg in compact filaments .",
    "the strength of magnetic field in the compact radio knots in cas  a is estimated to be 13 mg @xcite , just sufficient to produce year - scale variability through synchrotron cooling and shock acceleration of multi - tev electrons .",
    "indeed , here we report significant time variations in nonthermal x - ray emission from many compact regions .",
    "the distance to cas  a is assumed to be 3.4 kpc @xcite so the angular scale of @xmath2 corresponds to 1  pc .",
    "we analyzed the x - ray data obtained with the acis - s3 chip on 2000 january 30 @xcite , 2002 february 6 @xcite , and 2004 february 8 @xcite , each with @xmath3 ksec exposure .",
    "table [ tbl : log ] gives the log of the _ chandra _ observations .",
    "the observations were made with acis - s3 in the graded mode , with which telemetry size can be reduced .",
    "the three observations have almost identical configuration such as the aim point and the roll angle , allowing us to directly compare the three images without taking account of the varying point - spread functions ( psfs ) .",
    "the aim point is located @xmath4 southeast of the central point source , the compact remnant left behind after the supernova explosion .",
    "the x - ray analysis was done using the ciao software package ( version 3.4 ) .",
    "we reprocessed the event data , applying standard data reduction with the latest calibration files .",
    "we find that the sky coordinates of the central point source in the three epochs are consistent with each other with an accuracy of @xmath5 .",
    "the point source itself is estimated to be moving at an angular speed of @xmath6 @xcite , thus @xmath7 in the 4-yr span .",

    "this energy band corresponds to the continuum emission between ca and fe k lines , comprised of thermal bremsstrahlung and nonthermal component(s ) . assuming that the hard x - ray above 10 kev is dominated by nonthermal radiation processes , we estimate about @xmath9 of 46 kev photons should be of nonthermal origin .",
    "filamentary structures having high surface brightness in the continuum band are found only for radii less than @xmath10 ( referred as inner filaments ) , implying their association with the reverse shock as is shown to be the case by @xcite .",
    "we are interested here in the nonthermal x - ray components .",
    "we selected the two boxes shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : whole ] based on the following criteria .",
    "first , we identified regions sufficiently bright in the 46 kev band , exceeding @xmath11 at least in one epoch , in order to obtain statistics enough for a variability search .",
    "note that this condition is met only by the inner filaments , associated with the reverse shock or its secondary shocks .",
    "the second requirement is that the level of the continuum emission is high relative to the silicon line strength . specifically , we calculated the ratio of 46 kev counts to 1.72.2 kev counts at each pixel , and selected those regions having the ratio exceeding 0.5 . in this way",
    ", we found that the _ inner filaments _ satisfying these criteria are distributed inside the two boxes only .",
    "since we do not aim at constructing a statistical sample in this work , we adopted these simple criteria , accounting for neither position - dependent psfs nor effective area .",
    "figure [ fig : filaments ] displays a sequence of three - epoch 46 kev images of the central box ( left ) and the western box ( right ) , each with dimensions of @xmath12 .",
    "morphologically distinctive components that satisfy the criteria mentioned above are labeled as a , b , c , e , g , and h. also we tagged an additional two features , d and f.    the 46 kev images over a 4-yr time interval reveal a dozen time - variable structures .",
    "region c has decreased by a factor of 2 from 2000 to 2004 .",
    "region h underwent a flux brightening by 50% over the time interval of 4 yr . ( by measuring the silicon line flux from the compact ejecta features , we estimated a systematic error in the flux measurements to be @xmath13 . ) the variable filaments are spatially extended beyond _ chanda _",
    "s psfs , typically @xmath14 in length and @xmath15 in width .",
    "also , some filaments that we did not label , such as those in the south of region c , exhibit time variability .",
    "year - scale time variability appears to be the prevailing nature in the bright filaments or knots in the 46 kev band .    before investigating the epoch - dependence of the spectral parameters , we first constructed x - ray spectra averaged over the three epochs .",
    "regions a and b were combined into a single zone , and regions d , e , f , and g were merged . the background spectrum taken from a nearby ,",
    "low brightness region was subtracted from each spectrum .",
    "since the choice of a background region largely affects the low - energy part of the x - ray spectrum of region h , photons below 3 kev were discarded for this region .",
    "the four x - ray spectra ( a@xmath16b , c , d@xmath16e@xmath16f@xmath16 g , and h ) in the 18 kev band are shown in figure  [ fig : xspec ] .",
    "they all appear to be line - less .",
    "to characterize the shape of the line - less x - ray spectrum , we adopted a simple power - law model attenuated by interstellar absorption , which yielded statistically good fits .",
    "we obtained the best - fit parameters in ranges of @xmath17 and @xmath18 as summarized in table  [ tbl : parameter ] .",
    "the absorbing column density is broadly consistent with those for thermal components @xcite .",
    "we also performed spectral fitting using a thermal bremsstrahlung model .",
    "a statistically acceptable fit was obtained in each case .",
    "the best - fit electron temperature is in a range of 4.06.6 kev , much higher than the electron temperatures , 12 kev , derived for the x - ray knots showing thermal spectra ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , by combining all the spectral data , the equivalent width of the iron k lines is constrained to be @xmath19 ev .",
    "the absence of the emission lines disfavors any bremsstrahlung interpretation of the featureless x - ray spectra , including bremsstrahlung by suprathermal electrons @xcite .",

    "the absorbing column density was fixed at a relevant value in table  [ tbl : parameter ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : evolution ] shows the time sequence of the unabsorbed x - ray flux normalized by that in the year 2000 .",
    "four out of the eight regions exhibit large time variations ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the time sequence of photon index @xmath32 for each region is also presented in figure  [ fig : evolution ] .",
    "we found notable variations of @xmath32 only in two cases , regions f and h. region h gives the hardest index of @xmath33 in 2000 , suggesting a direct link between flux increase and spectral hardening .",
    "the change in @xmath32 found in region f should be treated with care , because region f faded after 2000 and became almost invisible in 2002 and 2004 .",
    "photon index measured in 2002 and 2004 would not be physically connected with that in 2000 .",
    "we have found that a half ( @xmath34 ) of the filamentary regions that were selected simply by their brightness and hardness , showed a year - scale variability in x - ray flux .",
    "the x - ray spectra of the selected regions in the 18 kev range are featureless and well fit by an absorbed power law with a photon index @xmath35 . given the absence of emission lines , we prefer to attribute the nonthermal x - ray emission in regions a  h to synchrotron radiation by very high - energy electrons .",
    "synchrotron x - ray filaments or knots would originate in slightly overdense ejecta , say by a factor of @xmath36 , into which a reverse shock ( or transmitted shocks ) with a typical shock speed of @xmath37 has been driven ( see * ? ? ?",
    "recently , @xcite have reported x - ray variability in compact thermal knots , resulting from the passage of reverse shock over the ejecta clumps . in the entire face of the remnant",
    ", they identified six time - varying structures ; all but one region ( their r4 , corresponding to our region c ) were modeled by a ",
    "thermal \" spectrum , specifically by a non - equilibrium - ionization plasma with an electron temperature of @xmath38 kev . on the other hand",
    ", we found a comparable number of variable  nonthermal \" features just inside the two small boxes , by making use of 46 kev maps which are sensitive to nonthermal variability .",
    "morevoer , if we apply our criteria of significant variability , @xmath31 , to the @xcite sample , only two features remain .",
    "we conclude that variable nonthermal features are much more prevailing than the thermal ones .",
    "cas  a is a very bright nonthermal radio source which indicates the presence in the remnant of relativistic electrons with a lorentz factor @xmath39 .",
    "the same electrons produce also high energy gamma - rays through relativistic bremsstrahlung .",
    "since the gas density in cas a is known quite well , the gamma - ray flux is robustly controlled by the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "therefore , high energy gamma - ray observations , combined with radio data , can provide reliable measurements of the magnetic field @xcite . a simple homogeneous model based on the radio observations and the upper limits of the @xmath40  mev flux reported by the egret collaboration @xcite yields a lower limit on the magnetic field of 0.4 mg @xcite . in a more sophisticated two - zone model of @xcite , the magnetic field in the compact radio knots , where particle acceleration is supposed to be taking place ,",
    "is constrained to be @xmath41 .",
    "these values would reasonably be applicable to the x - ray filaments , which have a similar size with the radio features , and are also presumed to be the sites of efficient particle acceleration by reverse ( or secondary ) shocks .",
    "it is interesting to ask whether the x - ray flux changes are attributable solely to the changes in magnetic field strength .",
    "if so , it is expected that a substantial flux change in synchrotron x - rays accompanies a marked change in radio intensity .",
    "while the radio flux is proportional to @xmath42 , the x - ray flux has weaker dependence on @xmath43 , because x - rays are emitted in a quasi - saturated regime",
    ". therefore one would expect stronger variations in the radio than in the x - ray band . according to @xcite , however , among about 70 bright radio compact knots exceeding @xmath44",
    ", none showed a brightness increase larger than @xmath45 in the archive very large array data at 5 ghz .",
    "a typical rate of brightening is about @xmath46 , corresponding to an @xmath47-folding time of @xmath48 , which is much longer than the x - ray variability timescale of @xmath49 .",
    "therefore it is more likely that the observed time variations are caused mainly by a rapid increase or decrease in the density of x - ray - emitting electrons .",
    "( the increase in the radio - electron density above the  sea \" level is expected to be less significant , provided that fresh electrons have a harder energy spectrum than old electrons . ) indeed , as we argue below , the known constraint on @xmath43 provides the synchrotron cooling time being compatible with the observed time variability .",
    "we have reported a similar x - ray variability in snr rx  j1713.7@xmath03946 , and attributed it to fast synchrotron cooling and shock acceleration of electrons @xcite .",
    "let us examine the observed variability timescale , using the equations presented in @xcite .",
    "synchrotron cooling time is given by @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the magnetic field strength in units of mg and @xmath52 is the mean synchrotron photon energy in units of kev . for @xmath53 ,",
    "the synchrotron cooling timescale becomes comparable to the variability timescale , @xmath54 yr .",
    "therefore , even a magnetic field of 0.4 mg is able to explain the observed variability . for @xmath55 , if the injection of relativistic electrons responsible for the synchrotron x - rays has suddenly ceased in a filament , the x - ray flux can be reduced on a timescale of @xmath56 .",
    "if the electron injection rate ( i.e. , the number of particles picked up and injected into the acceleration process in unit time ) decreases noticeably in 4 yr , the number of x - ray - emitting electrons and consequently x - ray intensity can drop as observed .",
    "we note that plasma characteristics may change on a timescale of a few years given the arcsecond - scale size of the thermal ejecta filaments .",
    "rising flux is a signature of ongoing production ( acceleration ) of synchrotron - emitting electrons with energies of @xmath57 .",
    "it implies that electron energy can increase to @xmath57 in 4 yr or less at the shock . assuming that electrons are accelerated via diffusive shock acceleration , the acceleration time of the x - ray - emitting electrons is given by @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is a gyrofactor , and @xmath60 is the velocity of the reverse shock relative to the unshocked ejecta ahead of it in units of @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , reverse shocks with a typical speed of @xmath37 @xcite and a magnetic field of 2 mg can accelerate x - ray - emitting electrons within a timescale of @xmath62 yr , provided that the acceleration proceeds close to the bohm diffusion limit ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "the presence of time variability together with the absence of the fe - k lines strongly prefer a synchrotron origin of the hard x - ray emission in the selected filaments , providing new evidence of acceleration to multi - tev energies at the reverse ( and transmitted ) shocks in ejecta .",
    "though the regions we studied here contain only a portion of the reverse - shocked gas , the bulk of the hard x - rays above 10 kev is also likely of a synchrotron origin .",
    "if so , the steepness of the continuum spectrum above 10 kev , @xmath64 @xcite , indicates that the synchrotron spectrum rolls off at around 1 kev , being consistent with the theory of diffusive shock acceleration ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the maximum energy of the electrons is thus constrained to be @xmath57 .",
    "therefore the tev gamma - rays measured by hegra @xcite and magic @xcite groups are difficult to be explained by electron bremsstrahlung in the reverse - shocked ejecta , and are likely to be of a hadronic origin .",
    "the interpretation of the x - ray variability has to be critically assessed through future theoretical and observational works .",
    "regardless of what is behind the nonthermal x - ray variability , it offers us a new diagnostic tool to understand particle acceleration in supernova shocks .",
