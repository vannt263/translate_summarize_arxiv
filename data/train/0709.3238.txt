    "a recent article @xcite was devoted to lie point symmetries , acting on ordinary difference equations and lattices , while leaving their set of solutions invariant .",
    "the purpose of this article is to extend the previously obtained methods and results to the case of partial difference equations , i.e. equations involving more than one independent variable .",
    "algebraic techniques , making use of lie groups and lie algebras , have proved themselves to be extremely useful in the theory of differential equations @xcite .    when applying similar algebraic methods to difference equations , several decisions have to be made .",
    "the first decision is a conceptual one .",
    "one can consider difference equations and lattices as given objects to be studied .",
    "the aim then is to provide tools for solving these equations , simplifying the equations , classifying equations and their solutions , and identifying integrable , or linearizable difference equations @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can consider difference equations and the lattices on which they are defined , to be auxiliary objects .",
    "they are introduced in order to study solutions of differential equations , numerically or otherwise .",
    "the question to be asked in this is : how does one discretize a differential equation , while preserving its symmetry properties @xcite .    in this article",
    "we take the first point of view : the equation and the lattice are _ a priori _ given .",
    "the next decision to be made is a technical one : which aspect of symmetry to pursue . for differential equations one can look for point symmetries , or generalized ones .",
    "when restricting to point symmetries , and constructing the lie algebra of the symmetry group , one can use vector fields acting on dependent and independent variables . alternatively and equivalently",
    ", one can use evolutionary vector fields , acting only on dependent variables . for difference equations , these two approaches are in general not equivalent and may lead to different results , both of them correct and useful .",
    "several aspects of symmetry for discrete equations were pursued in earlier articles by two of the present authors ( d.l . and p.w . ) and collaborators .",
    "the `` intrinsic method '' which provides , in an algorithmic way , all purely point symmetries of a given differential - difference equation on a given uniform fixed lattice was introduced in @xcite .",
    "this was complemented by the `` differential equations method '' in @xcite .",
    "in addition to point symmetries the differential equation method provides a class of generalized symmetries .",
    "it was pointed out that in many cases the two methods provide the same result , i.e. all symmetries are point ones .",
    "the two methods were successfully applied to many specific problems @xcite .",
    "the advantage of these two approaches are their simplicity , their algorithmic character , and their close analogy to symmetries of differential equations .",
    "their disadvantage is that many interesting symmetries , like rotations among discrete variables , are lost in this approach .",
    "a complementary approach was first developed for linear difference equations @xcite , again given on fixed uniform lattices .",
    "it was formulated in terms of linear difference operators , commuting with the linear operator defining the original difference equation .",
    "this approach provides a large number of symmetries and the symmetry algebras of the discrete equations and their continuous limits are actually isomorphic .",
    "the symmetries of the difference equations are not point ones : they act at many points of the lattice .",
    "they do however provide flows that commute with the flow determined by the original equation and can thus be used to obtain solutions .",
    "this aspect of commuting flows has been adapted to nonlinear difference and differential - difference equations @xcite .",
    "the equations are defined on a fixed and uniform lattice .",
    "generalized symmetries are considered together with point ones and some of the generalized symmetries reduce to point ones in the continuous limit .",
    "the methods for finding these generalized symmetries rely on either linearizability , as in the case of the discrete burgers equation @xcite , or on integrability ( the existence of a lax pair ) as in the case of the toda hierarchy @xcite , or the discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "this symmetry approach is powerful whenever it is applicable .",
    "together with point and generalized symmetries it provides bcklund transformations as a composition of infinitely many higher symmetry transformations .",
    "this aspect has been explored in detail for the toda lattice @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that bcklund transformations for difference equations , just as for differential ones , are not obtained directly as lie symmetries ( not even as generalized ones ) .",
    "each of the above methods has its own merits and will be further developed in the future .    in this article",
    "we take the same point of view as in our recent article @xcite .",
    "we consider point symmetries only and use the formalism of vector fields acting on all variables , dependent and independent ones . in @xcite",
    "we considered only one discretely changing variable .",
    "the lattice was not fixed .",
    "instead it was given by a further difference equation .",
    "point symmetries act on the entire difference system : the equation and the lattice .",
    "the lattice is not necessarily uniform and we explored the effect of choosing different types of lattices .",
    "the idea of using transforming lattices is due to dorodnitsyn and coworkers @xcite .",
    "we differ from them in one crucial aspect .",
    "they start from a given symmetry group and construct invariant difference schemes for a given group .",
    "we , on the other hand , start from a given difference scheme and find its lie point symmetry group .",
    "previously this was done for the case of one independent variable . in this article",
    "we generalize to the multidimensional case .",
    "the generalization is by no means trivial .",
    "the lattice is given by @xmath0 equations , where @xmath1 is the number of independent variables , all of them varying discretely .",
    "transformations of continuously varying independent variables , if present , are also taken into account .",
    "we stress that the approach of this article complements those of previous ones .",
    "the results of @xcite and @xcite are obtained if we chose a special form of the lattice ( e.g. @xmath2 in the case of one independent variable , where @xmath3 is a fixed , nontransforming constant ) .",
    "we purpusely avoid any use of integrability .",
    "like lie theory for differential equations , this approach is applicable to arbitrary differential systems , integrable or not .    a general formalism for determining the symmetry algebra is presented in section  2 .",
    "it generalizes the algorithm presented earlier @xcite for ordinary difference equations to the case of several independent variables . in section",
    "3 we apply the algorithm to a discrete linear heat equation which we consider on several different lattices , each providing its own symmetries .",
    "section  4 is devoted to difference equations on lattices that are invariant under lorentz transformations . in section  5",
    "we discuss two different discrete burgers equations , one linearizable , the other not .",
    "the lattices are the same in both cases , the symmetry algebras turn out to be different .",
    "section  6 treats symmetries of differential - difference equations , i.e. equations involving both discrete and continuous variables .",
    "some conclusions are drawn in the final section  7 .",
    "for clarity and brevity , let us consider one scalar equation for a continuous function of two ( continuous ) variables : @xmath4 . a lattice will be a set of points @xmath5 , lying in the plane @xmath6 and stretching in all directions with no boundaries .",
    "the points @xmath5 in @xmath6 will be labeled by two discrete labels @xmath7 .",
    "the cartesian coordinates of the point @xmath7 will be @xmath8 with @xmath9 ( we are of course not obliged to use cartesian coordinates ) . the value of the dependent variable in the point @xmath7 will be denoted @xmath10 .    a difference scheme will be a set of equations relating the values of @xmath11 in a finite number of points .",
    "we start with one ` reference point ' @xmath7 and define a finite number of points @xmath12 in the neighborhood of @xmath7 .",
    "they must lie on two different curves , intersecting in @xmath7 .",
