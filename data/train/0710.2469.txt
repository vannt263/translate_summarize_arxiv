    "cp violation in the charged b meson decays has been discovered for the first time in the three body charmless hadronic reaction @xmath6 , @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "data on three body @xmath8 decays are commonly analyzed using the isobar model which violates unitarity and requires many free parameters . in @xcite",
    "we have developed a model with a unitarized description of final state interactions between the two pions .",
    "we found interesting interferences between the @xmath9 and @xmath10 resonances . within a similar approach and for the @xmath5",
    "effective masses smaller than about 1.8 gev , we study another part of the dalitz plots corresponding to the @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 decays where the strange resonances @xmath14 are observed . among them , one encounters two resonances @xmath15 and @xmath16 formed in the @xmath17 @xmath18- and @xmath19- waves , respectively .",
    "these two resonances dominate the pion - kaon vector and scalar form factors which play an essential role in the description of the decay amplitudes .",
    "the strange form factors are determined from unitary coupled - channel equations using the experimental data on the @xmath20 phase shifts and inelasticities and some constraints from chiral perturbation theory .",
    "the amplitudes for the @xmath21 decays consist of two terms .",
    "the first part corresponds to the quark weak transitions @xmath22 or @xmath23 in the qcd factorization approximations .",
    "the second one is a phenomenological long - distance amplitude with @xmath24 or @xmath25quarks in loop .",
    "such an amplitude with the @xmath24quark in loop , called the charming penguin term @xcite , could be related to @xmath8 decay processes with intermediate @xmath26 states . for example , the @xmath19-wave part of the @xmath27 decay amplitude reads :    @xmath28\\bigg\\ } \\ .",

    "we analyse the experimental data of the belle and babar collaborations @xcite for the four reactions : @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the physical observables fitted in our model include 12 values of the branching fractions and direct cp - violating asymmetries for the @xmath44 and @xmath45 decays in different charge combinations and 249 data points for the @xmath46 effective mass and helicity angle distributions .",
    "if the charming penguin parameters are not included in the fit then the theoretical values of the branching fractions for these decays are too small by factors ranging between 2.3 and 3.6 .",
    "the results without the charming penguin terms are in agreement with those recently calculated by cheng , chua and soni @xcite .",
    "we have then performed two separate fits with 4 penguin parameters : in the first fit the experimental branching fractions for the @xmath45 decays have been included while in the second fit they have been omitted .",
    "the fit was much better in the second case .",
    "typical results of the @xmath46 effective mass distributions for these two cases are shown in fig .",

    "1(a ) the theoretical curve underestimates the narrow maximum of the @xmath15 resonance and overestimates the wide maximum due to the @xmath16 resonance . on the contrary , in fig .",
    "1(b ) both maxima are well reproduced .",
    "the average branching fractions and asymmetries for the second fit are given in table 1 .",
    "the cp asymmetries are in a general agreement with data .",
    "the theoretical value of the @xmath47 branching fraction is close to the belle and babar results , however the corresponding @xmath48 value , equal to @xmath49 , is substantially smaller than the experimental values .",
    "one should stress the fact that these experimental numbers are _ not _ directly measured .",
    "they are calculated by both collaborations using the isobar model .",
    "we calculate our branching fractions simply by integrating the @xmath46 effective mass distributions over the energy range specified in table 1 .",

    "the renormalized average branching fractions for the @xmath48  decays are about 52 % larger than the result of our model fitted to the same @xmath46 effective mass and helicity angle data .",
    "the published experimental branching fractions are then too large by the same amount . a partial explanation of this fact can rely on the presence of a phenomenological nonresonant part of the decay amplitudes used in the framework of the isobar model . in our approach both resonant and nonresonant parts are included in the strange @xmath5 scalar form factor",
