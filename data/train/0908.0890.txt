    "the geometric phase of quantum system undergoing adiabatic , cyclic evolution was first discovered by berry @xcite and a simple geometric interpretation was given by simon @xcite .",
    "it has a tremendous impact on various areas of physics which have triggered active researches over a quarter of century . now it is recognized that the geometric phase is an important concept of quantum mechanism both from a theoretical perspective and potential applications .",
    "a manifestation of the berry phase is the well - known aharonov - bohm ( ab ) effect @xcite that an electrical charge which cycles around a magnetic flux . from the viewpoint of the symmetry between magnetic field and electric field in the maxwell equations , aharonov and",
    "casher predicted that a magnetic moment acquires a phase around a charge flux line @xcite .",
    "the the aharonov - casher ( ac ) effect is weak in the neutron interference experiment @xcite , while recently an enhanced ac effect is realized in the two - dimensional electron system confined in a semiconductor quantum well with strong spin - orbit coupling @xcite .",
    "this is another great manifestation of the berry phase .",
    "the researches on the spin - orbit interaction system @xcite lead to the discovery of the quantum spin hall ( qsh ) material @xcite as a new phase of the condensed matter , which can be regarded as two copies of the integer quantum hall systems for up and down spins with the opposite chiralities . for a strip geometry ,",
    "the edge states for up and down spins propagate in the opposite directions along each edge , which are called the helical edge modes @xcite .",
    "when the fermi energy of a qsh system is in the bulk gap , only the edge modes are responsible for transport , thus the whole system can be regarded as two one - dimensional ( 1d ) channels on both edges of the strip .",
    "recently , chu _ et.al .",
    "_ has predicted the ab oscillations in the magnetoconductance of a singly connected qsh disk @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we consider the spin transport of a qsh round disk connected to two normal electrodes with a vanishing spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) .",
    "the system is equivalent to a 1d ab ring in which the transport is carried out by the helical edge states .",
    "the up and down spin propagating in opposite directions along the edge results in a spin rotation effect under a magnetic field , which is a manifestation of the berry phase in the spin space . besides ,",
    "because the external magnetic field lifts the spin degeneracy , a spin filter effect is found , which arises from the spin - resolved resonant tunneling .",

    "for a strip geometry , it is well known the hamiltonian with @xmath10 has a pair of helical edge modes on each side of the strip .",
    "similarly for a round disk geometry we find it also has helical edge modes along the edge , each forming an ideal 1d loop .",
    "the spin - up states travel clockwise , and the spin - down states travel anti - clockwise .",
    "when the fermi energy of a qsh system is in the bulk gap , only the edge modes are responsible to transport .",
    "the edge modes can be described by an effective 1d hamiltonian@xcite,@xmath11 where @xmath12 is the fermi velocity and @xmath13 is the pauli matrix defined in the @xmath14 space .",

    "obviously this hamiltonian retains the information in the @xmath14 space and neglects the dynamics in the ( @xmath16 ) space , it can be used to study the properties of spin qualitatively .",
    "now we consider a qsh round connected to two normal electrodes without soi , an effect similar to the ab effect is expected .",
    "but the effect here must be different from the conventional ab effect because the hamiltonian ( [ effective ] ) is relative to spin .",
    "if the incident electron is polarized in the x - y plane ( we assume the quantum well is grown along the z direction ) , the polarization direction of the outgoing current will rotate in the x - y plane when an perpendicular magnetic field is applied on it .",
    "the magnetic flux through the disk induces the spin current oscillation rather than the charge current oscillation in the conventional ab effect .",
    "the spin rotation process can be analyzed through the 1d hamiltonian ( [ effective ] ) .",
