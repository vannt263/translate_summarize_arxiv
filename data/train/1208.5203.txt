    "in the non - destructive evaluation area , an inverse problem is finding the specific characteristics ( location , geometry , internal constitution etc . ) of small inhomogeneities from measurements of scattered or far - field data .",
    "this problem , which arises in fields such as physics , engineering , and biomedical science , is highly related to everyday human life and is still a challenging problem @xcite .    among them , finding the locations of anti - personnel mines ( embedded in the soil ) from electromagnetic data ( measured in the air ) is an interesting and important problem in the military services .",
    "the mines have different material properties from the surrounding medium and they are small relative to the area . the main purpose of this kind of application is to find their locations more accurately , not to retrieve complete information . for this purpose ,",
    "non - iterative music - type algorithm for finding locations of small inhomogeneities buried within a half - space at a fixed frequency has been developed , refer to @xcite .",
    "music type algorithms are advantageous in the sense that they are fast , stable , can easily be extended to the multiple inhomogeneities , and they do not require specific regularization terms that are highly dependent on the problem at hand . however , due to the reason that one is faced with an aspect - limited inverse problem in the reflection mode because sources and receivers are located upper half - space , sometimes inexact locations are identified .",
    "hence , in order to obtain an accurate locations of such inhomogeneities , an alternative algorithm that can overcome these problems is necessary .",
    "motivated by the above fact , we propose an effective , non - iterative location search algorithm at multiple frequencies that can work on limited view data in order to find the accurate locations of small electromagnetic inhomogeneities completely embedded within a homogeneous ( lower ) half - space .",
    "the starting point is that the collected msr matrix can be approximated by a rigorous asymptotic expansion formula of the scattering amplitude in the presence of such inhomogeneities .",
    "this approximation leads us to proceed the singular value decomposition of the msr matrix and to identify the structure of singular vectors . applying the structure of singular vectors , a filter function operated at several frequencies",
    "can be designed for finding exact locations of inhomogeneities . moreover ,",
    "based on the statistical hypothesis testing , we can confirm that the proposed location search algorithm offers more exact information of locations than the established music - type algorithm and kirchhoff migration .",
    "various numerical examples with noisy data will illustrate the behavior of the proposed location search algorithm operated at several frequencies . unlike the numerical setting in @xcite , computational examples under the narrow / wide range of incident and observation directions configuration and the closely located small inclusions situation show the feasibilities and limitations of the proposed algorithm .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    ", we briefly survey the two - dimensional direct scattering problem for two - layered medium and introduce an asymptotic expansion formula for the scattering amplitude . in section [ sec3 ] , we design a location search algorithm by producing a filter function operated at several frequencies and compare its detection performance with traditional music - type algorithm and kirchhoff migration . in section [ sec4 ] , corresponding numerical experiments with random noise are shown and compared with the result via music - type one and kirchhoff migration to demonstrate its performance . in section [ sec5 ] we give a brief conclusion .    finally , we will refer to @xcite as a useful reference that investigates the so - called reciprocity gap music as another algorithm linked to the music one . in this reference",
    ", the author shows that reconstructed positions of the small inhomogeneities via reciprocity gap music algorithm are slightly more accurate than the traditional music one .",

    "although we could obtain a reasonably good result when @xmath220 and @xmath270 , one can not determine accurate locations of inhomogeneities when @xmath246 and @xmath256 based on the discussions in section [ sec3sub ] .    various results in this paper show that the proposed algorithm is very stable and effective but it still contains some factors for further improvements .     when @xmath266 , @xmath267 ( left ) and @xmath268 , @xmath269 ( right),title=\"fig : \" ]   when @xmath266 , @xmath267 ( left ) and @xmath268 , @xmath269 ( right),title=\"fig : \" ]      at this moment , we add a white gaussian noise with 10db snr to the unperturbed data and change the range of incident and observation directions . for this purpose , we adopt the same test configuration as section [ sec4:3 ] except that the ranges of observation directions @xmath271 are varied by changing the values of @xmath272 and @xmath273 .",

    ", we can clearly identify three locations of @xmath187 .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that the proposed algorithm is robust with respect to the large amount of random noise since the normalized filter function ( [ imagefunctionmultiple ] ) is not significantly influenced by the noise .",

    "the approach is based on the asymptotic formulation due to the existence of small electromagnetic inhomogeneities . throughout numerical simulations",
    ", we can conclude that the proposed algorithm not only performs quite well even in the existence of random noise but also successfully improves existing limitations ( poor longitudinal resolution against an excellent transverse resolution ) of music algorithm proposed in @xcite and kirchhoff migration .",
    "in addition , it still has some points of improvement for finding the locations of inhomogeneities under the situation @xmath246 , @xmath256 and wide range of incident / observation directions .",
    "it is worth mentioning that such results obtained at low computational costs can be a good initial guess of a level - set evolution @xcite or of any other standard iterative algorithm .",
    "although only two - dimensional problem have been considered herein , we expect that the proposed strategy , e.g. , asymptotic formula , filter design , etc . , could be extended to the three - dimensional problem , refer to @xcite for related works .",
    "moreover , inconveniences of the proposed algorithm are also the same as those of sar .",
    "hence , comparison of sar and the proposed algorithm will be an interesting subject .",
    "finally , we would like to emphasize that the proposed algorithm can be extended to the shape identification of electromagnetically thin , arc - like , penetrable inhomogeneities , refer to @xcite .",
    "although , further mathematical investigation is necessary , we believe that it can also be extended to the identification of small or extended perfectly conducting cracks .",
