    "recent experiments @xcite attracted a great deal of attention to an old but fundamental question : how fast can a quantum particle loose information about its initial state in the presence of interaction ? in other words , how fast can interaction destroy the quantum phase coherence ?",
    "the answer on this question essentially depends on the type of interaction .",
    "it follows from general principles of quantum mechanics that quantum coherence of the wave function can not be destroyed due to _",
    "elastic _ interaction with an external potential .",
    "another physical situation may take place if the quantum particle interacts with other ( quantum ) degrees of freedom which play the role of an effective environment . in this case",
    "quantum dynamics of the particle can not be described by the wave function but only by the density matrix .",
    "various examples ( to be discussed below ) show that such interactions _ may lead _ to a complete destruction of quantum coherence .",
    "a general approach to the problem was formulated by feynman and vernon @xcite who demonstrated that the effect of environment can be taken into account by means of averaging over its all possible quantum states . as a result",
    "the environment variables are integrated out and quantum dynamics of the particle can be described only in terms of its own degrees of freedom . within this approach interaction with the external environment",
    "is taken into account by means of the so - called _ influence functional _ which appears in the ( effective ) action for the particle as a result of averaging over the bath variables .",
    "it is quite clear that specific properties of the environment are not important unless they explicitely enter the expression for the influence functional . in other words",
    ", the particle does not `` feel '' the difference between physically different bathes provided they are described by the same influence functional .",
    "these ideas were developed further by caldeira and leggett @xcite who showed that the above arguments can be used to describe quantum dynamics of dissipative systems and derived the effective action for the case of linear ohmic dissipation .",
    "the same type of analysis was also developed by schmid @xcite who formulated a quasiclassical langevin equation approach describing real time dynamics of a quantum particle in the presence of dissipation and quantum noise .",
    "although the above papers are dealing with the model of a bosonic environment it is obvious that the ideas @xcite can be applied to a fermionic bath as well .",
    "this was done e.g. by ambegaokar , eckern and schn @xcite in the case of superconducting tunnel junctions and later by schn and one of the present authors @xcite in a somewhat broader context of a metallic system with dissipation .",
    "although the microscopic hamiltonian describing electrons in a metal @xcite is quite different from one used in the model @xcite the final expressions for the influence functionals for various metallic systems and tunnel junctions obtained in @xcite turn out to be similar or even completely equivalent to those considered in refs .",
    "this equivalence is just an illustration of the property discussed above : the effect of physically different environments is indistinguishable provided they are described by the same influence functional .    in refs .",
    "quantum dynamics of a certain collective variable of interest ( the phase ) was considered .",
    "this variable was extracted `` from interaction '' , after that electronic degrees of freedom were integrated out and the effective action for the phase was derived .",
    "one can also generalize this procedure and describe quantum dynamics of superconductors considering the phase as a quantum field @xcite .",
    "in all these cases the collective variable is intimately linked to the electronic bath , quantum dynamics of the former does not exist without the latter at all .    in this paper",
    "we will analyze a somewhat different situation .",
    "namely , we will study quantum dynamics of an electron propagating in a disordered metal and interacting with other electrons which play the role of effective environment .",
    "it is well known that quantum interference of electrons scattered on impurities lead to quantum corrections to the classical drude conductivity @xcite .",
    "these so - called weak localization corrections have been extensively discussed in the literature ( see e.g. @xcite for review ) . the magnitude of these corrections is known to be determined by the time within which electrons in a metal can be described by a phase coherent wave function . at times exceeding this so - called decoherence time @xmath1 quantum coherence is destroyed , quantum interference is not anymore possible and therefore the classical diffusion picture is restored .",
    "the decoherence time @xmath1 in a disordered metal can be determined by various physical processes , such as electron - electron and electron - phonon interactions , electron scattering on magnetic impurities etc .",
    "( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it was shown by altshuler , aronov and khmelnitskii @xcite that at not very low temperatures the effect of electron - electron interaction on the decoherence time is equivalent to that of classical nyquist noise in a disordered conductor . in this case one",
    "finds @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the effective system dimension .",
    "this result demonstrates that decoherence effect of electron - electron interaction becomes weaker as the temperature is lowered .    down to which temperature",
    "does the above result remain correct ? or , more generally , does @xmath1 increase with decreasing @xmath4 at all temperatures thus going to infinity at @xmath5 ?",
    "a positive answer on the latter question would mean that at @xmath0 the electron in a disordered metal can be described by the phase coherent wave function even in the presence of coulomb interaction with other electrons .",
    "this scenario faces several important problems :    \\(i ) even if one assumes that electrons in a metal are isolated from the external environment it is hard to believe that the @xmath6-electron wave function @xmath7 ( @xmath8 is the total number of electrons in a conductor , @xmath9 ) can be factorized into the product of single electron wave functions .",
    "this would imply that coulomb interaction is effectively renormalized to zero at @xmath0 .",
    "we see no reason to expect that .",
    "\\(ii ) in any real physical situation electrons in a metal _ are _ coupled to the external environment , e.g. via external leads .",
    "electrons can enter and leave a piece of metal , interact with electrons in the leads etc . due to this reason",
    "the whole system of @xmath6 electrons in a metal ( and not only one electron ! ) should be treated as open and thus can not be described by the wave function @xmath7 even at @xmath0 .",
    "\\(iii ) in the case of caldeira - leggett type of models it is well known that after a sufficienly long time even at @xmath0 quantum coherence is destroyed due to interaction with the bath no matter how weak this interaction is ( see e.g. @xcite ) . for strong enough interaction the particle exhibits practically no quantum features and can even get localized in a potential well @xcite .",
    "since the caldeira - leggett models are qualitatively similar to the problem in question ( in both cases one quantum degree of freedom interacts with many others playing the role of a bath ) it is quite natural to expect also the decoherence time for interacting electrons in a disordered metal to remain finite even at @xmath0 .",
    "\\(iv ) saturation of the temperature dependence for @xmath1 at low @xmath4 was clearly observed in experiments @xcite as well as in numerous earlier experimental studies ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "even a qualitative interpretation of these results in terms of eq .",
    "( [ aak ] ) is not possible .",
    "there exist sufficiently strong experimental reasons to believe that this saturation is _ not _ due to heating of the sample or the effect of magnetic impurities .",
    "all the above arguments strongly suggest that the decoherence time @xmath1 should remain finite down to @xmath0 .",
    "although the experimental evidence for the low temperature saturation of @xmath1 is available for quite a long time the physical reason for this effect was not convincingly explained in the literature .",
    "an earlier attempt @xcite to provide this explanation in terms of zero - point fluctuations of impurities has failed @xcite .",
    "only very recently it was suggested @xcite that quantum decoherence in a disordered conductor is caused by the mechanism qualitatively similar to one existing in the caldeira - leggett model , namely the interaction of a particle with an external quantum bath . in the present case an electron propagating in a disordered metal interacts with a fluctuating electric field produced by other electrons which play the role of an effective _ dissipative _ environment .",
    "due to randomness of such fluctuations the quantum coherence is lost within a finite time @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , this mechanism is not new .",
    "exactly the same effect was considered in ref . where only the low frequency ( classical ) fluctuations of the environment @xmath10 were taken into account .",
    "this approximation is sufficient at high temperatures and yields the result ( [ aak ] ) .",
    "however , as the temperature is lowered there remain less and less classical modes in the fluctuating environment .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to expect that below a certain temperature @xmath11 quantum fluctuations of the environment with @xmath12 will take over and determine the decoherence time @xmath1 .",
    "the generalization of the corresponding analysis @xcite is straightforward @xcite and allows to evaluate both the classical - to - quantum crossover temperature @xmath11 and the decoherence time @xmath1 at low @xmath4 .",
    "the results @xcite agree quite well with the experimental findings @xcite .",
    "several fundamentally important questions should still be answered , however .",
    "perhaps the main one is about the role of the pauli principle in our description of the electron - electron interaction . at sufficiently high temperatures",
    "there are always enough empty states into which electrons can get scattered provided the energy transfer due to interaction does not exceed @xmath4 . in this case the pauli principle does not play a very important role . on the other hand , at @xmath5 in equilibrium",
    "all quantum states below the fermi energy are occupied . thus scattering into any of these states",
    "is forbidden due to the pauli principle and the electron energy can not decrease . at @xmath0",
    "it also can not increase due to interaction with other electrons because they are also in the ground state .",
    "thus at @xmath0 inelastic electron - electron scattering is forbidden due to the pauli principle .",
    "if so , how can one expect quantum decoherence to occur as a result of the electron - electron interaction at @xmath0 ?",
    "one might think that due to the pauli principle the electron is simply insensitive to zero - point fluctuations of other electrons , and quantum decoherence does not take place .",
    "another though somewhat related question is about the effect of phonons .",
    "it is quite obvious that at a finite @xmath4 decoherence can also be caused by electron - phonon interaction @xcite .",
    "however at @xmath13 there are no real phonons in the system and therefore no quantum decoherence due to phonons should be expected . on the other hand , if we admit that zero - point fluctuations of electrons lead to decoherence , zero point fluctuations of the lattice ions should have qualitatively the same effect .",
    "is it possible to match this conclusion e.g. with the well known fact that electrons do not scatter on zero - point lattice fluctuations , and therefore the phonon contribution to the conductance of a metal vanishes at @xmath0 ?    on a more formal level",
    "it is sometimes conjectured that the above arguments correspond to the exact cancellation of keldysh diagrams for @xmath1 in the limit @xmath13 .",
    "if this is indeed the case the inverse decoherence time @xmath14 would be exactly equal to zero at @xmath0 and ( at least qualitatively ) would match with the result ( [ aak ] ) .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to demonstrate that this is _ not _ the case .",
    "the key point is that all the above arguments apply as far as the electron _",
    "inelastic relaxation time _",
    "@xmath15 is concerned .",
    "the latter can be found by means of a quantum kinetic approach which will be fully reproduced within the framework of our analysis .",
    "however , as it has been pointed out in ref . and",
    "discussed later in other works @xcite , the decoherence time @xmath1 is entirely different from @xmath15 and , in contrast to the latter , can not be determined with the aid of any kind of kinetic analysis .",
    "roughly speaking , the decoherence time controls the decay of off - diagonal elements of the electron density matrix and ( even at high temperatures ) has little to do with inelastic scattering of electrons .",
    "therefore the quasiclassical kinetic treatment is insufficient and a fully quantum mechanical analysis should be elaborated to determine the time @xmath1 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we make use of the general formalism of the green - keldysh functions and derive a formally exact equation of motion for the electron density matrix in the presence of coulomb interaction .",
    "this equation explicitely accounts for the pauli principle and allows for a clear understanding of its role in the process of electro - electron interaction in a metal . in section 3",
    "the effective action ( or the influence functional ) for the fluctuating scalar potential in a metallic conductor is derived .",
    "we also demonstrate that in equilibrium this influence functional satisfies the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite and establish the relation with the real time effective action derived in the caldeira - leggett models @xcite . in section 4 with the aid of these general results we will derive the real time effective action for the electron propagating in a metal and determine the decoherence time @xmath1 and the weak localization correction to conductivity at low temperatures .",
    "our formalism naturally includes both electron - electron and electron - phonon interactions and allows to establish the corresponding contributions to @xmath1 from each of these processes . in section 5",
    "we derive the quasiclassical kinetic equation and demonstrate the relation of our analysis to the standard kinetic approach which allows to evaluate the inelastic scattering time @xmath15 .",
    "we also derive the quasiclassical langevin equation which under certain conditions can be used to describe propagation of electrons in a disordered metal .",
    "discussion of the results is given in section 6 .",
    "we discuss the relation of our results with previous works as well as possible consequences of the low temperature saturation of @xmath1 for the existing picture of strong localization in low dimensional conductors .",
    "we also briefly compare our theoretical predictions with available experimental data .",
    "some details of our calculation are presented in appendices .",

    "such fluctuations are essentially the same for many electron states , and the pauli principle does not play any role .    on a very simple level",
    "the decoherence effect at low @xmath4 can be understood as follows . during interaction with other electrons the electron phase changes .",

    "this increase of the resistance was interpreted as a crossover from weak to strong localization .",
