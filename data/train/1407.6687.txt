    "<S> we review the recent alice data on charged particle multiplicity in p - p collisions , and show that it exhibits geometrical scaling ( gs ) with energy dependence given with characteristic exponent @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> next , starting from the gs hypothesis and using results of the color glass condensate effective theory , we calculate @xmath1 as a function @xmath2 including dependence on the scattering energy @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that @xmath1 both in p - p and p - pb collisions scales in terms of scaling variable @xmath4 where @xmath5 is multiplicity dependent interaction area in the transverse plane . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we discuss how the behavior of the interaction radius @xmath6 at large multiplicities affects the mean @xmath7 dependence on @xmath2 , and make a prediction that @xmath1 at high multiplicity should reach an energy independent limit .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , the alice collaboration has published charged particle spectra from p - p collisions at three lhc energies 0.9 , 2.76 and 7 tev . </S>",
    "<S> this data , together with p - pb and pb - pb data has been subsequently used to construct other quantities , in particular total multiplicity and mean @xmath7 as a function of charged particle multiplicity @xmath8 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this dependence has been next tested against hypothesis of geometrical scaling ( gs ) proposed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite with a conclusion that `` alice p - p and p - pb data at low and intermediate multiplicities are compatible with the proposed scaling '' with substantial departure from scaling at larger multiplicities @xcite . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we show that gs works in fact much better , provided one takes into account energy dependence of the interaction radius at fixed multiplicity .    the paper is organized as follows . </S>",
    "<S> first we introduce the basic concepts of geometrical scaling for @xmath7 spectra and show that the alice data exhibit gs over a limited rage of @xmath7 with energy dependence determined by the characteristic exponent @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> this value is slightly lower than the one found from the analysis @xcite of single non - diffractive cms data @xcite , and the one found @xcite in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> next , we derive the formula for mean transverse momentum and discuss multiplicity dependence of the interaction radius . </S>",
    "<S> we use results of the calculations @xcite performed within the color glass condensate ( cgc ) effective theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally we discuss the energy dependence of the interaction radius and show that very good scaling of mean @xmath7 is seen in the alice data . </S>",
    "<S> we also argue that the character the energy dependence changes for large multiplicities where the interaction radius schould reach energy independent value . </S>",
    "<S> such behavior has testable phenomenological consequences . </S>",
    "<S> we finish with conclusions .    </S>",
    "<S> multi - particle production at low and moderate transverse momenta probes the nonperturbative regime of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . </S>",
    "<S> yet at high energies an overall picture drastically simplifies due to the existence of an intermediate energy scale , the saturation momentum @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> particle production proceeds via gluon scattering whose distribution is determined by the ratio @xmath11 where bjorken @xmath12 determines longitudinal gluon momentum . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , on dimensional grounds , the gluon multiplicity distribution is given in terms of the universal function @xmath13 @xcite@xmath14 where@xmath15 is the scaling variable . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath16 is the saturation momentum , @xmath17 is an arbitrary scale parameter for which we take 1  gev@xmath18 , and for @xmath19 we take @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis of gs presented in the present paper is not sensitive to the actual value of @xmath19 and/or @xmath21 , but only to the value of @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> bjorken @xmath12 s of colliding partons for mid rapidity production take the following form@xmath23 here @xmath24 is the scattering energy and @xmath5 is a transverse area which will be specified later . </S>",
    "<S> equation  ( [ dndydpt ] ) exemplifies the property of the particle spectra known as geometrical scaling ( gs ) where an observable that in principle depends on two kinematical variables , such as @xmath7 and @xmath3 ( or bjorken @xmath12 ) , depends in practice on a specific combination of them through the scaling variable . in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dndydpt ] ) we have suppressed strong coupling constant @xmath25 whose dependence on @xmath7 is expected to introduce weak gs violation .    equation ( [ dndydpt ] ) applies to the scattering of symmetric systems ( pp , aa ) . for pa scattering , which we will also discuss here , </S>",
    "<S> there are in principle two saturation scales : the one of the proton @xmath26 , and that of the nucleus , @xmath27 , @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this issue has been discussed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite with a conclusion that for high enough multiplicities and for central rapidities the two scales should have the same energy dependence , meaning that @xmath28 this condition is enough for gs of the form ( [ dndydpt ] ) to hold for pa collisions as well . </S>",
    "<S> a test of this assumption will be provided by the forthcoming pa data at a different lhc energy .    </S>",
    "<S> geometrical scaling @xcite has been introduced in the context of dis at hera and later extended to particle production in hadronic collisions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the saturation scale appears due to the nonlinear effects in parton evolution with growing energy . </S>",
    "<S> this evolution is in general described by the jimwlk equation @xcite which for large @xmath29 reduces to the balitsky - kovchegov equation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these equations possess traveling wave solutions which explicitly exhibit gs @xcite .    a good description of large energy scattering , or equivalently of small bjorken @xmath12 s , is the effective field theory @xcite of the color glass condensate ( cgc ) </S>",
    "<S> ( for an introduction and review see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . in the theory of the cgc , </S>",
    "<S> hadrons after a collision stretch in the longitudinal direction strong gluonic fields that are coherent in the transverse plane over the radius @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> multi - particle production proceeds by the decay of these flux tubes , and it has been shown that the dominant contribution comes from the production of gluons with @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism is able to explain different features of high energy p - p collisions including _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ negative binomial distribution @xcite or ridge correlations in high multiplicity events @xcite . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we shall use predictions of the cgc effective theory for the interaction radii as functions of gluon multiplicity in p - p and p - pb collisions discussed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    an immediate consequence of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dndydpt ] ) is that @xmath7 spectra at different energies fall on one universal curve if plotted in terms of the scaling variable @xmath32 which for @xmath33 reduces to @xmath34.]@xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the quality of gs depends on the value of the exponent @xmath22 entering the definition of the saturation scale ( [ qsdef ] ) . in order to determine @xmath22 in a model independent way </S>",
    "<S> we employ a method of ratios where we construct @xmath36 which , according to ( [ dndydpt ] ) , should be equal to unity if gs is present . in practice @xmath37 in a window @xmath38 . for particles of small </S>",
    "<S> @xmath7 ( _ i.e. _ small @xmath32 ) , comparable to @xmath39 and/or pion mass , we do not expect the arguments that lead to gs to be applicable , and for large @xmath7 we enter into a domain of large bjorken @xmath12 s ( [ bjx ] ) where gs is explicitly violated and perturbative qcd takes over . in eq.([rik ] ) we have assumed that the number of charged particles is proportional to the number of produced gluons and the proportionally factor does not depend on energy ( so called parton - hadron duality ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have checked by explicit calculations of mean square deviations of @xmath40 s from unity that the best value of @xmath22 for the alice data that gives the smallest @xmath41 over the largest interval in @xmath32 is equal to 0.22  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : spectra ] where in the left panel we plot @xmath42 as functions of @xmath43 and as functions of @xmath44 for @xmath0 ( right panel ) . </S>",
    "<S> we see that spectra at different energies overlap within a window up to @xmath45 . in order </S>",
    "<S> not to be biased by the logarithmic scale of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : spectra ] , we construct two ratios @xmath46 and @xmath47 corresponding to the lhc energies @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50  tev , respectively . these ratios are plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ratios ] where again we plot them as functions of @xmath7 ( left panel ) and as functions of @xmath44 ( right panel ) . </S>",
    "<S> we see relatively good scaling where the weak rise @xmath51 s with @xmath44 can be attributed to the residual dependence of @xmath22 upon @xmath52  @xcite .     </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : ratios ] is almost identical as in the case of the cms data analyzed in refs .  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however we have found in @xcite that @xmath53 rather than @xmath54 and that the gs window extends to slightly higher @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> this may be due to the different event selection ( single non - diffractive at cms vs. inelastic in alice ) and different pseudo rapidity coverage ( @xmath55 at cms vs. @xmath56 at alice ) . </S>",
    "<S> in a recent study of gs in prompt photon production @xcite the optimal range of @xmath22 turned out to be 0.220.28 . </S>",
    "<S> these differences in @xmath22 maybe in fact due to some additional weak energy dependence of the multiplicity distribution ( [ dndydpt ] ) , like the one of @xmath25 or some energy dependence of the unintegrated glue . </S>",
    "<S> moreover one should bare in mind that there is no factorization theorem for multiparticle production in @xmath57 dependent gluon density formalism . studying alice data we have found for example  @xcite , that better gs quality is achieved for the differential cross - section , rather than for the multiplicity , with @xmath58 . </S>",

    "<S> we need a jacobian:@xmath61 where we have introduced an _ average _ </S>",
    "<S> saturation scale@xmath62 which can be thought of as a solution of the equation@xmath63 note that due to our choice of @xmath64 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ qsdef ] ) @xmath65 and @xmath21 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ qbars ] ) are in gev and @xmath3 is in tev .    </S>",
    "<S> it follows that@xmath66 where @xmath67 is an integral over the universal function @xmath13@xmath68 and as such is energy independent . </S>",
    "<S> the constant @xmath67 can , however , depend on particle species produced in the collision .    </S>",
    "<S> the universal function @xmath13 is not known from first principles , however , in most phenomenological applications where good description of the @xmath65 spectra is given in terms of tsallis parametrization , one can show that @xcite @xmath69 here constant @xmath70 follows from the fits to the transverse momentum spectra and it is of the order of 0.1 @xcite , and power @xmath71 is of the order @xmath72 . in what follows </S>",
    "<S> we shall need this explicit form of @xmath13 only to estimate possible energy dependence of its integrals , such as @xmath67 of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dnoverdy ] ) , coming from the fact that experimentally @xmath65 spectra are measured up to some @xmath73 which translates into the maximal @xmath74 @xmath75 which is energy - dependent . here </S>",
    "<S> again @xmath65 and @xmath21 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ taumax ] ) are in gev and @xmath3 is in tev . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that for the alice data @xmath76 , 1300 and 1700 for scattering energies @xmath77 , 2.76 and 7 tev respectively . since @xmath71 is here numerically the highest power , the contributions of the unphysical tail , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ from @xmath78 , are dumped approximately as @xmath79 multiplied by a small coefficient @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore in what follows we shall neglect finite energy effects on the integrals of @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> we have checked numerically that the contribution to the mean transverse momentum coming from this effect is at the per mille level . </S>",
    "<S> equation ( [ dnoverdy ] ) can be though of as a definition of the saturation scale , which is essentially given as gluon number density per transverse area . </S>",
    "<S> one should however keep in mind that the transverse area itself does depend on multiplicity as well , since it corresponds to the overlap area of two colliding systems at fixed impact parameter @xmath81 . the smaller @xmath81 the larger @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this dependence will be of importance in the following , where we discuss mean @xmath65 dependence on multiplicity .    </S>",
    "<S> it follows from eq.([dnoverdy ] ) that particle multiplicity in mid rapidity grows like a power of the scattering energy , which is in remarkable agreement with the lhc data  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the power of this growth is solely given by the energy rise of the average saturation scale @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> numerically for @xmath0 , we find that @xmath83 , which again is in agreement with experimental results  @xcite . from this simple analysis we conclude that @xmath5 is energy independent over the lhc energy range ( or very weakly dependent for larger energy span ) .    </S>",
    "<S> when this formula is applied to minimum bias hadron - hadron collisions , we are basically fixing the average hadron radius . </S>",
    "<S> this average radius seems to be a slowly varying function of energy . </S>",
    "<S> however , and this will be of primary importance in the following , if we _ fix _ @xmath84 and then _ change _ energy , then @xmath5 has to change with energy as well in agreement with eq.([dnoverdy ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is because different radii are sampled at the different impact parameters . </S>",
    "<S> if we vary the density of particle per unit area , by varying the saturation momentum , and then require fixed multiplicity , we necessarily will sample different impact parameters corresponding to different areas .    in heavy ion collisions </S>",
    "<S> @xmath5 is equal to the geometrical transverse size of the overlap of the colliding nuclei . as such it is related to the centrality of the event and , in consequence , to the event multiplicity . </S>",
    "<S> it is less clear what is geometrical interpretation of @xmath5 in p - p collisions . in a model with an impact parameter dependent saturation scale @xmath85 @xcite we have : @xmath86 where the integral extends over the overlap area @xmath5 of colliding protons at a given impact parameter @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore obvious that also in the case of p - p scattering there should be a relation between @xmath5 and multiplicity in a given event . indeed </S>",
    "<S> , this dependence has been calculated within the cgc framework  @xcite , which predicts that @xmath5 depends on @xmath87 linearly , and then saturates at some constant value . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior has a simple geometrical interpretation : number of particles produced in hadronic collisions is proportional to the active overlap volume . </S>",
    "<S> once the maximal volume is reached , further growth of multiplicity is due solely to fluctuations .    . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite can bee seen . </S>",
    "<S> second , at some fixed energy @xmath94 one can express @xmath95 in terms of the gluon multiplicity ( [ dnoverdy ] ) , which gives @xmath96 note that for fixed @xmath97 interaction size @xmath5 in eq.([ptoneterm0 ] ) depends , as explained above , on the reference energy @xmath94 and also on @xmath97 itself , which is related to the number of charged particles @xmath98 in the kinematical range of a given experiment : @xmath99 here the coefficient @xmath100 relates gluon multiplicity to the multiplicity of observed charged hadrons within the rapidity interval @xmath101 . for alice data used in this paper @xmath102 . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : radii ] as the solid lines as well , whereas dashed lines show the change in the multiplicity dependence caused by sharp @xmath6 saturation shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : radii ] as dashed lines.,height=226 ]    we can now check these ideas against experiment using alice data on p - p , p - pb and pb - pb scattering @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> let us first consider the case where interaction radii at different energies saturate at different values corresponding to the solid lines in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : radii ] .    we have used the p - p data at 7 tev as the reference fitting to it formula ( [ meanptfit ] ) with the following result:@xmath124 one would naively expect@xmath125 which for alice pseudo - rapidity interval @xmath56 would give 2.5 rather than 1.138 . </S>",
    "<S> predictions for other two lhc energies follow from eq.([ptwdep ] ) with no other parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the result is plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ppwithfit ] and one can see good but not perfect agreement with the data . </S>",
    "<S> one can observe that the 2.76  tev points ( red down - triangles ) at higher multiplicities tend towards the 7  tev curve , and that two last 0.9  tev points ( blue up - triangles ) seem to show the similar tendency . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior can be attributed to the fixed value saturation of @xmath6 as depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : radii ] by the dashed lines . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of fixed @xmath6 is shown by the dashed lines in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ppwithfit ] . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that 2.76  tev data follow quite closely the fixed saturation radius prediction starting from @xmath126 , whereas the 0.9  tev are well below the dashed line .    </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note at this point that the fit leading to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ pars ] ) is performed over the multiplicities measured at 7  tev that correspond to the most right ( black dashed ) vertical line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : radii ] . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that the fit is driven totally by the almost linear rise of @xmath6 with @xmath127 with some sensitivity to the curvature before saturation , and does not depend on the value of the saturation radius . on the contrary , </S>",
    "<S> lower energy data in fixed saturation radius scenario , are more sensitive both to the curvature and the value of the saturation radius for which , however , we do not have model calculation . </S>",
    "<S> therefore our analysis can be only qualitative at this point . </S>",
    "<S> with more data at higher multiplicities one could make a global fit to disentangle the functional dependence of @xmath6 on multiplicity in a model independent way .    </S>",
    "<S> analogously we can calculate @xmath93 for p - pb collisions using the same values of parameters ( [ pars ] ) with @xmath128 of eq.([rppb ] ) . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ meanptfit ] ) and ( [ meanptpbpb]).,height=226 ]    finally we would like to check if mean @xmath60 in pb - pb can be also described by formula ( [ meanptfit ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately there is no calculation of the interaction radius dependence on @xmath104 for heavy ion collisions . making the plausible assumption that @xmath129{n_{\\text{ch}}}\\label{pbradius}\\ ] ] which simply states that the saturation radius where formula ( [ pbradius ] ) should flatten is much larger than in the case of p - p and p - pb collisions , and should not play any role in the region where data for the latter reactions are available . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : scaled ] where we plot @xmath133 as a function of the scaling variable @xmath4 both for p - p and p - pb collisions . </S>",
    "<S> we see quite satisfactory scaling in contrary to the claim of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite where the scaling variable has not been rescaled by the energy factor @xmath134 . </S>",
    "<S> we can not superimpose the pb - pb data on the plot in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : scaled ] because we do not know the absolute normalization of @xmath135 ( [ pbradius ] ) , which can be found only by explicit calculation within the cgc effective theory .    </S>",
    "<S> from this simple exercise we may conclude that mean @xmath7 dependence on charged particle multiplicity can be well described in an approach based on the color glass condensate and geometrical scaling . </S>",
    "<S> more understanding is certainly required as far as heavy ion data are concerned , although an an onset of gs in nuclear collisions has been already reported  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have established that alice data on charged particle multiplicity in p - p collisions exhibit geometrical scaling within a reasonable window in scaling variable @xmath32 with exponent @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> there are some differences in the value of @xmath22 extracted from different experiments and different reactions , however , all results fall within a window 0.22  0.32 . further studies to understand these fine effects are clearly needed . </S>",
    "<S> the main finding of the present work concerns the energy dependence of @xmath93 which is given by the energy dependence of the average saturation scale @xmath136 . our final plot , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : scaled ] , demonstrates very good scaling of @xmath93 both in p - p and p - pb collisions . </S>",
    "<S> new results at higher energies , especially in the case of p - pb , will provide an important test of these ideas .    </S>",
    "<S> we have also argued that the interaction radii at different energies should for large multiplicities converge to some fixed value . </S>",
    "<S> such tendency is clearly seen at 2.76  tev and presumably at 0.9  tev at multiplicities above 20 . </S>",
    "<S> our simplistic sharp cut - off model fails to describe 0.9  tev data , but that could be presumably cured not affecting the other energies , by allowing for a somewhat larger value of the saturation radius and careful modeling of the curvature before saturation . </S>",
    "<S> we find it quite unexpected that such simple observable as @xmath137 can provide such nontrivial information on the energy and multiplicity behavior of the interaction radius . </S>"
