    "extending the variational methods and the geometric measure theory from the euclidean to the wiener space has recently attracted a lot of attention . in particular , the theory of functions of bounded variation in infinite dimensional spaces started with the works by fukushima and hino @xcite . since then",
    ", the fine properties of @xmath2 functions and sets of finite perimeter have been investigated in @xcite .",
    "we point out that this theory is closely related to older works by m. ledoux and p. malliavin @xcite .    in the euclidean",
    "setting it is well - known that the perimeter can be approximated by means of more regular functionals of the form @xmath3 when @xmath4 tends to zero , in the sense of @xmath1-convergence with respect to the strong @xmath5-topology @xcite .",
    "an important ingradient in this proof is the compact embedding of @xmath2 in @xmath5 .",
    "a natural question is whether a similar approximation property holds in the infinite dimensional case .",
    "the main goal of this paper is answering to this question by computing the @xmath6-limit , as @xmath7 , of the allen - cahn - type functionals ( see section [ notation ] for precise definitions ) @xmath8    in the wiener space there are two possible definitions of gradient , and consequently two different notions of sobolev spaces , functions of bounded variation and perimeters @xcite . in one definition",
    "the compact embedding of @xmath9 in @xmath10 still holds ( * ? ? ?",
    "5.3 ) and the @xmath6-limit of @xmath11 is , as expected , the perimeter up to a multiplicative constant .",
    "we do not reproduce here the proof of this fact , since it is very similar to the euclidean one .",
    "a more interesting situation arises when we consider the other definition of gradient , which gives rise to a more invariant notion of perimeter and is therefore commonly used in the literature @xcite . in this case",
    ", the compact embedding of @xmath9 in @xmath10 does not hold anymore .",
    "in particular sequences with uniformly bounded @xmath11-energy are not generally compact in the ( strong ) @xmath12-topology , even though they are bounded in @xmath13 , and hence compact with respect to the weak @xmath13-topology .",
    "this suggests that the right topology for considering the @xmath6-convergence should rather be the weak @xmath13-topology .",
    "a major difference with the finite dimensional case is the fact that the perimeter function defined by @xmath14 + \\infty \\qquad & \\textrm{otherwise } \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] is no longer lower semicontinuous in this topology , and therefore can not be the @xmath6-limit of the functionals @xmath11 .",
    "the problem is that the sets of finite perimeter are not closed under weak convergence of the characteristic functions .",
    "however , it is possible to compute the relaxation @xmath15 of @xmath16 ( theorem [ relax ] ) , which reads : @xmath17 + \\infty \\qquad & \\textrm{otherwise . } \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] such functional is quite familiar to people studying log  sobolev and isoperimetric inequalities in wiener spaces @xcite .",
    "our main result is to show that the @xmath6-limit of @xmath11 , with respect to the weak @xmath13-topology , is a multiple of @xmath15 ( theorem [ modmortmal ] ) .",
    "the proof relies on the interplay between symmetrization , semicontinuity and isoperimetry .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in section [ notation ]",
    "we recall some basic facts about wiener spaces and functions of bounded variation . in section [ rapehr ]",
    "we give the main properties of the ehrhard symmetrizations .",
    "we also prove a plya - szeg inequality and a bernstein - type result in the wiener space ( propositions [ ehrfunc ] and [ probern ] ) , which we believe to be interesting in themselves . in section [ secrelax ]",
    ", we use the ehrhard symmetrization to compute the relaxation of the perimeter ( theorem [ relax ] ) .",
    "finally , in section [ mmm ] we compute the @xmath6-limit of the functionals @xmath11 ( theorem [ modmortmal ] ) and discuss some consequences of this result .",
