    "in loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) @xcite , cosmological models are quantized in a non - perturbative manner using the basic operators and following the methods of loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) .",
    "the first cosmologies to be studied were the homogeneous and isotropic friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) space - times with a massless scalar field , where it was initially shown that the quantum equations of motion do not break down at the big - bang singularity @xcite , and then that the singularity is replaced by a quantum gravity `` bounce '' that connects a pre - bounce contracting flrw space - time to a post - bounce expanding flrw space - time @xcite .",
    "these results have since been generalized to include flrw space - times that allow non - zero spatial curvature @xcite , a non - zero cosmological constant @xcite or have pressureless dust as the matter content @xcite ( the latter as a test for the full lqg framework proposed in @xcite where an irrotational pressureless dust field acts as a clock ) . in all of these cases",
    "the big - bang singularity has also been shown to be replaced by a bounce .",
    "space - times that allow anisotropies @xcite and inhomogeneities ( using a hybrid quantization procedure ) @xcite have also been studied in lqc ; in the bianchi and gowdy models , the classical singularity is resolved as the singular states decouple from the non - singular states under the quantum dynamics .",
    "it is generally expected that the big - bang singularity is replaced by a bounce in this setting as well ( see , e.g. , studies of the effective equations for the lqc of the bianchi i @xcite and gowdy @xcite space - times ) , but this has not yet been shown as the full quantum dynamics have not yet been investigated .",
    "indeed , dynamical studies of inhomogeneous cosmologies in lqc rely strongly on the extrapolation of the properties of systems studied at a genuinely quantum level , in particular the preservation of semi - classicality and the validity of the semi - classical effective dynamics as a good approximation to the quantum dyanmics .    most recently cosmological perturbations have also been studied in lqc , first from an effective theory standpoint @xcite and then in quantum treatments following various approaches : a `` hybrid '' quantization ( i.e. , the lqc of the homogeneous background and a fock quantization of the perturbative degrees of freedom ) @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and by the lqc treatment of a discretization of the flat flrw space - time with scalar perturbations @xcite .",
    "these works have allowed the study of the dynamics of cosmological perturbations in the planck regime in some of the most interesting cosmological scenarios those that generate a scale - invariant power spectrum of scalar perturbations namely inflation @xcite , the matter bounce @xcite and the ekpyrotic universe @xcite .    in lqc , the main research effort is focused on investigating the loop quantum geometry effects , arising from a quantization which differs from the standard wheeler - dewitt one .",
    "the matter sector is usually dealt with in a perfunctory manner , although there do exist some studies on the polymeric matter sector in the literature @xcite ( including attempts to describe the perturbative degrees of freedom @xcite ) .",
    "most of the space - times studied to date in lqc are either vacuum space - times @xcite or with the particularly simple choice of a massless scalar field @xcite . while the cases of a massive scalar field in a flat flrw space - time @xcite , and a vector field in the bianchi i cosmology @xcite have also been studied , a robust analysis of the dynamical sector of the theories at a genuinely quantum level has only been performed for matter choices ( namely a massless scalar field or pressure - less dust ) which are idealizations of realistic ( from the point of view of particle physics ) matter fields . in particular",
    ", the principal components of the standard model have never been systematically analysed in this context and the lqc studies involving them rely on extrapolations from the above - mentioned idealizations . in the general context of cosmology ,",
    "a particularly important case is a perfect fluid of radiation formed by standard model particles .",
    "this article is dedicated to the study of a radiation - dominated space - time in lqc in the most simple setting possible : by emulating a radiation - dominated perfect fluid with as few as possible homogeneous standard model matter fields .    as the resolution of cosmological singularities in lqc is due to the loop quantization of the gravitational sector ( rather than any effect due to the matter fields ) , it seems reasonable to assume that the specific type of matter field does not affect the qualitative results of lqc and that the big - bang singularity is generically replaced by a quantum gravity bounce , regardless of the matter field .",
    "however , despite this expectation it is important to study a variety of matter fields in order to show that the results obtained for massless scalar fields do in fact hold more generally , especially in the situation when distinct fields are used as the emergent time ( i.e. , the fields are used as evolution parameters labeling the families of partial observables @xcite ) , since the use of matter clocks has been essential in studies of the quantum dynamics to date .",
    "another reason to study different matter fields is that it is not immediately obvious how to include some types of matter fields e.g .",
    ", vector fields in minisuperspace models that assume homogeneity and isotropy .",
    "this is a tricky problem as a homogeneous vector field necessarily picks out a preferred direction , which is clearly at odds with isotropy .",
    "we show that a model earlier proposed in classical cosmology is suitable for the hamiltonian framework , and thus for canonical quantum cosmology theories such as lqc .    finally ,",
    "concerning the matter content , the massless scalar field mostly used so far in the literature possesses a series of convenient properties that simplify the analysis . as we will see later in this paper ( secs .",
    "[ s.quant ] and  [ s.asym ] and apps .",
    "[ app : wdw ] and  [ app : scatter ] ) other ( more realistic ) matter fields do not possess many of these properties .",
    "this makes the study of other fields significantly more difficult and in particular requires substantial revisions and extensions of the analytical and numerical methods used in previous studies , for example @xcite .",
    "the increase in difficulty observed here for maxwell fields is expected to be generic for standard model matter fields .",
    "thus , the improvements to the methodology presented here may be essential for many further developments in lqc .",
    "as a first step in addressing these issues , we will study the loop quantization of a flat flrw space - time with a maxwell field , the massless vector field that satisfies maxwell s equations .",
    "this is a particularly interesting matter field for two reasons .",
    "first , it is a vector field , and therefore it will be necessary to determine how a vector field can be handled in a homogeneous and isotropic background .",
    "second , the equation of state of a maxwell field is that of radiation , namely @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the energy density and @xmath2 the pressure of the maxwell field .",
    "this second condition is particularly important as all matter fields with the dispersion relation @xmath3 that are in either the bose - einstein or fermi - dirac distribution behave like radiation at sufficiently high temperatures , that is they have the same equation of state @xmath4 . as the two properties of the matter fields that enter into the einstein equations in the homogeneous and isotropic limit are precisely their energy density and pressure , different fields that have the same initial @xmath1 and the same equation of state lead to the same gravitational dynamics of the flrw space - time .",
    "therefore , at high temperatures ( like the temperatures reached in the very early universe ) , all ( of the populations ) of the bosonic or fermionic fields that can be treated in a statistical manner are accurately mimicked by a population of maxwell fields .",
    "thus , the study of the maxwell field in loop quantum cosmology is of wide interest , as it can provide a good approximation to many different types of thermalized matter fields in the planck regime .    in this paper , following the improved dynamics loop quantization prescription @xcite",
    ", we will study in detail the quantum dynamics of the isotropic universe with a suitable population of maxwell fields as matter content and in particular show that the big - bang singularity is replaced by a quantum bounce in lqc .",
    "this strongly suggests that the initial cosmological singularity is resolved by quantum gravity effects in all flat flrw space - times where the matter field at high temperatures is well approximated by radiation .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ s.class ] , the classical theory will be reviewed and in particular it will be shown how , following @xcite , a matter sector constituted of maxwell fields can be made to be homogeneous and isotropic . then in sec .",
    "[ s.quant ] the quantum theory will be defined and numerically solved for semi - classical states ; some results concerning the asymptotic dynamics are presented in sec .",

    "the effective equations are presented in sec .",
    "[ s.eff ] , and we close with a discussion in sec .",
    "[ s.dis ] .",
    "the technical derivations leading to the results presented in sec .",
    "[ s.asym ] are contained in apps .",
    "[ app : wdw ] and  [ app : scatter ] .",
    "the units we use in this paper are such that @xmath5 , but @xmath6 and @xmath7 will remain explicit ; we define the planck length as @xmath8 .",
    "greek letters @xmath9 represent space - time indices , while the roman letters at the beginning of the alphabet @xmath10 represent spatial indices and @xmath11 represent internal spatial indices .",
    "in this section , we shall review a simple model that allows vector fields to be included in homogeneous and isotropic minisuperspace models .",
    "the key point is that in a gas of photons , there are many individual photons evenly spread out over space ( ensuring approximate homogeneity ) which are travelling in all directions ( ensuring approximate isotropy ) . in the statistical limit of a large number density of photons , the photon gas is homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "one way to model the stress - energy tensor for a photon gas is by working with a linear combination of plane waves . in order to see this ,",
    "recall that the stress - energy tensor for a single plane wave of radiation with amplitude @xmath12 and ( null ) tangent 4-vector @xmath13 is t _",
    "= k_k _ , where we assume that we are interested in @xmath14 only at scales larger than the wavelength of the plane wave @xcite .    in order to satisfy the isotropy requirement ,",
    "it is necessary to have plane waves ( with the same amplitude ) travelling in all directions , and then [ int - plane - waves ] t _ = k _ ( , ) k _ ( , ) , where @xmath15 is the tangent 4-vector of the plane wave travelling in the @xmath16 direction on the flrw space - time with the metric [ eq : flrw - metric ] s^2 = -n^2 t^2 + a(t)^2 ^2 . from this , it is easy to check that [ eq : flrw - tab ] t _ = u_u_+ p ( g _ + u_u _ ) , with [ eq : wave - pr ] = , p = , and @xmath17 is the usual co - moving 4-vector of the perfect fluid .",
    "this shows how it is possible to model a perfect fluid of radiation as a linear combination of plane waves travelling in all directions .",
    "however , this setup is unwieldy in the hamiltonian framework , so we will now introduce a toy model that gives the stress - energy tensor . in this toy model , there are three `` species '' or `` flavours '' of a maxwell field @xcite in a flat flrw universe .",
    "this simpler setting is relatively easy to handle in a hamiltonian setting , and so is more convenient for the quantum theory . in the following part",
    ", we describe this toy model , define the hamiltonian for the matter and gravitational sectors , and conclude the section by briefly discussing the classical dynamics .      motivated by the fact that a linear superposition of plane waves can yield a homogeneous and isotropic matter field ,",
    "in this paper we will consider a particularly simple linear superposition of this type . to be specific ,",
    "we take a linear superposition of three plane waves that are orthogonal and of equal amplitude . furthermore",
    ", for simplicity we assume the wave number of these plane waves to be zero , which then each correspond to homogeneous field configurations .",
    "this particularly simple linear superposition of plane waves is a toy model of which will make calculations in a canonical quantum framework tractable and allow us to define the loop quantum cosmology of a radiation - dominated space - time . while a more realistic model of a radiation - dominated space - time would be to consider a more general linear superposition of plane waves , this is very difficult to handle in a minisuperspace model of quantum cosmology and we leave this possibility for future work .",
    "nonetheless , does suggest using a simpler model namely , the linear superposition of the three homogeneous ( i.e. , plane waves with zero momentum ) and orthogonal vector fields in order to study a radiation - dominated space - time this is what we shall do in this paper , and in the remainder of this section we shall precisely define the model .    denoting the vector potential of each field by @xmath19 , where the index @xmath20 labels the three different @xmath18 fields , the lagrangian density for each of the three fields",
    "is given by [ lagrangian ] = - _ ^ , where @xmath21 is the field strength of the vector field , @xmath22}$ ] .",
    "now , in order to ensure the homogeneity and isotropy of the matter field , it is necessary to carefully choose the form of the @xmath19 for each @xmath23 . to obtain a homogeneous and isotropic stress - energy tensor , following @xcite we choose [ ansatz - u1 ] _ a = ( t ) ^_a , _ t = 0 , i.e. , we take the three vector potentials to be mutually orthogonal , and impose that they share the same time dependent length .",
    "this choice gives a field strength where the only non - zero components are _ ta = - _ at = _",
    "t ^_a . given the metric ,",
    "the lagrangian density of the fields is = ( _ t ) ^2 , and then the canonical momentum of the vector field is given by [ momentum - u1 ] ^ = = ^ , where we have introduced ^ = ( _ t ) ^ ^. a subsequent legendre transform gives the hamiltonian density for one of the @xmath18 species , = ^2 , and the poisson bracket between @xmath24 and @xmath25 is determined by the induced symplectic structure @xmath26 the ( appropriately regularized ) integral over the spatial cauchy slice @xmath27 can be performed trivially due to homogeneity , and the overall factor of the volume of the space can be absorbed into the definition of the fields known as the _ fiducial cell _ ) and subsequently ensuring that the resulting description admits a consistent regulator removal limit @xcite .",
    "see also the discussion in @xcite . ] .",
    "the poisson bracket following from the induced symplectic structure is [ eq : poisson - matt ] \\ { , } = .",
    "finally , the total hamiltonian density matter term is simply given by the sum of the three individual hamiltonian densities , [ eq : matter - ham ] _ m = _ = 1 ^ 3 = ^2 , from which it is possible to calculate the energy density @xmath1 and the pressure @xmath2 of the universe matter content : [ rho ] = = , [ pressure ] p = - = - = .",
    "this implies in particular the relation @xmath0 , just as one would expect for a radiation - dominated universe .",
    "alternatively , one can determine @xmath2 and @xmath1 by evaluating the stress energy tensor @xcite .",
    "that method also has the advantage of explicitly showing that the stress energy tensor is that of a homogeneous and isotropic perfect fluid .",
    "since we embed the matter fields discussed above in the isotropic flat spacetime , the geometrical degrees of freedom are the scale factor @xmath28 and its canonical momentum @xmath29 with the poisson bracket @xmath30 .",
    "these variables ( together with the matter degrees of freedom ) suffice for describing this symmetry - reduced system ( for details , see for example @xcite ) .",
    "however , there is another pair of conjugate variables that is more convenient for lqc ( see sec .",
    "[ s.quant ] and @xcite ) and which provide an equivalent description at the classical level , these variables are ( proportional to ) the oriented volume @xmath31 and its momentum @xmath32 ,    [ eq : var - geom]@xmath33    where the proportionality factor @xmath34 contains the barbero - immirzi parameter @xmath35 @xcite and the smallest non - zero eigenvalue of the lqg area operator @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath36 is often called the area gap and is of the order @xmath37 @xcite ( note that it has dimensions of area ) .",
    "the momentum @xmath32 is proportional to the hubble parameter @xmath38 in the classical theory .    in the variables @xmath39 the gravitational term of the hamiltonian constraint density takes the form @xmath40 together with the matter hamiltonian density , @xmath41 defines the classical dynamics of the system .",
    "the classical dynamics of this model is generated by the hamiltonian constraint term in the canonical action @xmath42 , \\ ] ] where the gravitational and matter terms are given by and respectively .",
    "the physical trajectories lie on the surface @xmath43    note that the integration in should in principle be performed over the entire constant time slice @xmath27 , however such an integral would diverge due to homogeneity and non - compactness of the slice . a standard way of removing this divergence is the introduction of an infrared regulator : a compact region @xmath44 of constant volume in comoving coordinates . here for the sake of simplicity we choose @xmath44 to be the cubical cell of edges generated by the vectors @xmath45 and of unit volume with respect to the line element @xmath46 .",
    "the equations of motion ( presented below ) do not depend on the choice of the fiducial cell , and so it follows that the physical results do not depend on the size of the cell and the limit of removing the regulator is trivial in the classical theory .",
    "note however that this is not the case in the quantum theory where taking the limit of @xmath47 is not trivial , see @xcite for more detailed discussions on this point .",
    "nonetheless , this limit exists and the resulting quantum theory is independent of the initial choice of the fiducial cell .    performing the ( regulated ) integral in we arrive at the following form of the constraint , _ h = -|| b^2 + ^2 .",
    "so far the choice of the lapse @xmath48 remains open , however in the quantum theory we will want to deparametrize the system with respect to the matter field in order to use @xmath24 as a clock . to synchronize the classical time with that clock ,",
    "we choose @xmath49 and denote the resulting time variable @xmath50 .",
    "this choice corresponds to working in conformal time , and the resulting constraint reads [ c - ham ] n _ h = -||^4/3 b^2 + ^2 .",
    "the equations of motion are the hamilton - jacobi equations which in this case consist of the following set of four coupled ordinary differential equations ,    [ eq : eom]@xmath51    these equations are equivalent to the usual friedmann equations and are easily solved .",
    "the matter degrees of freedom are determined by : the momentum of the electromagnetic field is a constant of the motion and @xmath24 grows linearly in conformal time [ c - sol - matt ] = const , ( ) = + _ o , where @xmath52 is a free constant of integration .",
    "the dynamics of @xmath39 are determined by and can be found in two steps : first we note that the equation for an auxiliary variable @xmath53 decouples from the system and so can easily be solved .",

    "there is no unique extension of the solution across the point @xmath58 , although there is a unique analytic extension through that point . ] .",
    "note that there is another constant of integration that is fixed by enforcing the constraint @xmath60 .",
    "the monotonicity of @xmath61 allows us to elimitate the time dependence from the equations of motion by reparametrizing the evolution in terms of @xmath24 and thus use the vector potential as an internal clock ,    [ eq : class - traj - dep ] @xmath62    where @xmath63 .",
    "@xmath64 then represents the `` initial time '' where the big - bang or big - crunch singularity occurs , according to the @xmath24 clock .",

    ": = = , p = = = .",
    "the procedure of quantizing ( within the lqc framework ) the classical system specified in the previous section is a direct analog of the procedure used for isotropic systems with a scalar field @xcite .",
    "therefore we recall it here only briefly , focusing mainly on the differences with respect to previous treatments and on the specific steps where quantization ambiguities force us to make particular choices .",
    "in general the process is an application of the dirac program : first the constrained system is quantized while ignoring the constraints ( the so - called _ kinematical _ quantization ) , then the constraints are defined as quantum operators , and finally the space of physical states is constructed out of the kernel of the quantum constraint operators . in this setting , meaningful physical quantities are represented by _ partial observables _",
    "let us start by recalling the kinematical quantization .      in this step ,",
    "following the majority of works in lqc , we implement a hybrid approach , quantizing the geometry degrees of freedom via a polymeric quantization while using the standard quantum mechanical tools for the matter sector @xcite .",
    "thus , the kinematical hilbert space is a product @xmath65 of the gravitational and matter hilbert spaces .",
    "the gravitational hilbert space is the space of square - summable functions on the bohr compactification of the real line ( the space of almost periodic functions ) @xmath66 .",
    "a convenient basis for this hilbert space is formed by the eigenfunctions of the @xmath67 operator operator , it is possible to construct the operator @xmath68 , which corresponds to the flux of the densitized triad across one of the faces of the fiducial cell . ] , the quantum counterpart of the variable @xmath69 introduced in .",
    "the inner product on @xmath70 is discrete , @xmath71 where however @xmath69 runs through the whole real line . as a consequence",
    ", @xmath70 is nonseparable .",
    "normalizable states on @xmath70 are represented by the wave function @xmath72 , @xmath73 we will require that operators acting within this space be well - defined on the domain @xmath74 of _ finite _ linear combinations of @xmath75 .    as the basic operators defined on a dense domain in @xmath70 we choose the operator @xmath67 ( proportional to the volume of the chosen comoving region of space ) and the @xmath18 unit shift operator @xmath76 such that @xmath77 the standard elementary operators of isotropic lqc namely , the triad flux @xmath78 across a face of the fiducial cell and the @xmath79 holonomy @xmath80 along a straight line of fiducial length @xmath81 can be expressed in terms of @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "the matter hilbert space is the standard lebesgue space @xmath83 . as a basis",
    "we choose the generalized eigenstates @xmath84 of the field operator @xmath85 .",
    "states are represented by square - integrable wave functions @xmath86 and the basic operators are    [ eq : op - matt ] @xmath87    the domain on which we require the operators to be well - defined is the schwartz space @xmath88 .",
    "the next step in the dirac program is the construction of the quantum operator representing the hamiltonian constraint and composed of the basic kinematical operators defined in and .",
    "the procedure , while a bit complicated , is well descibed in the literature , see for example @xcite . to capture the properties of full lqg we start by expressing the constraint in terms of the @xmath79 holonomies @xmath89 and densitized triads @xmath90 directly .",
    "next the constraint is regularized following the prescription given by thiemann @xcite . in particular , the field strength ( i.e. , the curvature of the connection ) is expressed in terms of a holonomy along a closed square loop of physical area equal to the lowest non - zero eigenvalue of the area operator in lqg ( relevant for lqc ) @xmath91 . as a result the gravitational part of the constraint is expressed in terms of the holonomy functions and the volume , which next are promoted to composite operators expressed in terms of the operators .",
    "the matter part of the constraint does not need any special treatment and can be immediately expressed in terms of the operators .",
    "the last step listed here involves some ambiguity due to different factor - ordering choices that are possible . here",
    "we choose a particularly convenient factor - ordering motivated by studies of the anisotropic bianchi i cosmology @xcite which involves a specific treatment of the sign function and simplifies the resulting physical hilbert space structure @xcite .",

    "2 .   due to presence of the @xmath98 terms the sectors @xmath99 and @xmath100 decouple . 3 .",
    "since @xmath93 is a difference operator coupling only points in @xmath31 separated by @xmath101 , one can split the support of @xmath70 elements onto independent sets @xmath102 ( preserved under the action of @xmath97 ) , where @xmath103 and @xmath104 $ ] .",
    "the first property implies that we can exclude the singular @xmath105 states from the support of the wave function , showing that the singularity is resolved at the quasi - kinematical level .    at this point",
    "it is useful to note one more important property of the model , namely that it does not feature parity violating interactions . in consequence",
    "the triad reflection ( here represented by @xmath106 ) is a large symmetry and the subspaces of symmetric and antisymmetric ( with respect to that reflection ) states are superselection sectors . as a consequence one can choose just one of them and then , due to properties @xmath107 and @xmath108",
    "above , restrict the support of the wave function to @xmath109 .",

    "of course , it is important to verify that the physics does not depend on the choice of the superselection sector , as there does not exist any principle that could justify one choice over another .",
    "one justification for working with a single sector is that while the entire hilbert space @xmath70 is not separable , each superselection sector @xmath113 is .",

    ", we took the three vector potentials to be homogeneous , orthogonal and to have equal amplitudes the most straightforward such system that can be coupled to an isotropic geometry .",

    "thus , a radiation - dominated flrw loop quantum cosmology is of great relevance for the study of the very early universe .",
    "an important difference of these studies with respect to previous works in lqc is that so far the matter content considered in lqc in a genuinely quantum treatment has never actually been a microscopic field observed in nature : the massless scalar field studied in @xcite is neither predicted by particle theories nor observed whereas the pressureless dust of @xcite is observed only as a large - scale phenomenon , due to the averaged behaviour of matter fields over super - galactic scales in cosmology and at micrometer scales in astrophysics . here by composing the matter content out of maxwell fields ,",
    "we have incorporated for the first time in lqc a fundamental matter field that is known to exist .",
    "that being said , it is important to keep in mind that the matter field considered here is not a rigorous simulation of thermal radiation with a large population of fields whose energies follow the bose - einstein distribution .",
    "instead , it is a toy model consisting of three orthogonal homogeneous maxwell vector potentials with equal amplitudes .",
    "while this is a particularly nice model due to its simplicity , it is essential to keep in mind the limitations of such a nave framework .",
    "this system was quantized within the lqc framework following the standard hybrid approach , namely a polymer quantization for geometrical degrees of freedom and the standard schrdinger quantization for the matter sector .",
    "the physical evolution of the quantum system is defined through the set of partial observables parametrized by the amplitude of the vector potential , which plays the role of an internal clock .",
    "the resulting dynamics were studied numerically , showing that the quantum dynamics are qualitatively similar to the dynamics for a matter content given by a massless scalar @xcite or a pressureless dust field @xcite .",
    "in addition , sharply peaked semi - classical states remain sharply peaked throughout their evolution , and the global evolution picture features two classical epochs , one each of contraction and expansion where the dynamics follow to great precision the predictions of general relativity connected deterministically by the quantum bounce .",
    "the matter energy density remains bounded above with the same upper bound found in other contexts , @xmath252 .",
    "furthermore , again as has been done for other matter fields in lqc , it was possible to define an effective classical description of the system , which accurately mimicks the genuine quantum evolution for sharply peaked states .",
    "finally , the scattering picture of the global evolution can be used in order to derive strong triangle inequalities between the dispersions of the wave packet in the distant past and future , which demonstrates the preservation of the semi - classicality of the state across the bounce .",
    "the analytical and numerical findings presented here , together with those of previous works on isotropic lqc , provide a strong indication that the global evolution picture and the preservation of semi - classicality across the bounce are generic features of flrw universe in lqc : they are independent of the matter content .",
    "thus , the current results are an additional confirmation of the robustness of the main results of lqc reported in the literature .",
    "the model studied here also has a particularly interesting property : the big - bang ( or big - crunch ) singularity is reached within finite emergent time ( this is also the case for a dust - dominated friedmann cosmology , but not for a massless scalar field ) .",
    "this fact makes it possible to directly address and compare the issue of singularity resolution in lqc and in geometrodynamics for this cosmology . indeed , for the wheeler - dewitt quantization of this system :",
    "@xmath253 the singularity is reached within the precision set by the wave packet dispersion , and @xmath254 the multitude of self - adjoint extensions implies that additional boundary data is needed at the singularity in order to deterministically evolve the wave packet past the point where zero - volume states are reached .",
    "these properties amount to the conclusion that in the wdw quantization the singularity is not resolved .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the results of the loop quantization , where the unitary evolution is unique and there exists a dynamical minimal volume ( proportional to @xmath255 , which for semi - classical states is much greater than the dispersion of the wave packet ) .",
    "these two results show that the classical singularity is dynamically resolved in lqc .",
    "on the other hand , note that if a positive cosmological constant is added , the low curvature dynamics of the cosmology will be similar to that of the flrw space - time with a massless scalar field @xcite : the vector potential used here as a relational clock will become frozen when the cosmological constant dominates the dynamics , and the infinite volume of the universe will be reached within a finite time . at the quantum level",
    "this implies the non - uniqueness of the unitary evolution ( i.e. , there exist many self - adjoint extensions of the evolution generator ) , and therefore it is necessary to provide additional data at the boundary @xmath256 to evolve the wave function beyond this point .",
    "a last important point is that the lqc flrw cosmology with maxwell fields is significantly more difficult from a technical standpoint than the case of a massless scalar field .",
    "most notably , the slower rate of convergence of the lqc evolution operator basis elements to their wdw analogs requires an improvement in the numerical techniques involved in the analysis , in particular incorporating higher order lqc corrections to the wdw basis elements .",

    "<S> we study the loop quantum cosmology of a flat friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker space - time with a maxwell field . </S>",
    "<S> we show that many of the qualitative properties derived for the case of a massless scalar field also hold for a maxwell field . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the big - bang singularity is replaced by a quantum bounce , and the operator corresponding to the matter energy density is bounded above by the same critical energy density . </S>",
    "<S> we also numerically study the evolution of wave functions that are sharply peaked in the low energy regime , and derive effective equations which very closely approximate the full quantum dynamics of sharply peaked states at all times , including the near - bounce epoch . in the process </S>",
    "<S> , the analytical and numerical methods originally used to study the dynamics in lqc for the case of a massless scalar field are substantially improved to handle the difficulties ( that generically arise for matter content other than a massless scalar field ) related to the presence of a maxwell field . </S>"
