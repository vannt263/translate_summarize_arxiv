    "wave function collapse models ( cms )  @xcite , as the modified theories of standard quantum mechanics , postulate a fundamental breakdown of quantum superposition at the macroscopic scale .",
    "they have been proposed to explain the lack of observations of macroscopically distinguishable superposition states of macroscopic objects and offer a possible solution to the quantum measurement problem  @xcite and the quantum - to - classical transition .",
    "there are several different versions of the cms , e.g. , the ghirardi - rimini - weber approach  @xcite , continuous spontaneous localization ( csl )  @xcite , and gravitationally - induced cms  @xcite .",
    "these models modify the schrdinger equation by introducing appropriate stochastic nonlinear terms , of which the effect is negligible for microscopic systems , while becomes prominent for macroscopic objects resulting in the emergence of macroscopic classicality .",
    "many proposals have been put forward to examine these cms in different systems and with different approaches . in general , they can be divided into two kinds : in an interferometric way and in a noninterferometric way . for the former ,",
    "matter - wave interferometry  @xcite is typically used , where large massive objects , e.g. , molecules or clusters  @xcite , are sent through interference gratings .",
    "however , to date the mass range has not been reached to effectively test the cms . for the latter , protocols  @xcite have been recently provided based on cavity optomechanics  @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of this approach is that the preparation of large spatial superposition states  @xcite is not required .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that collapse noise induced momentum diffusion of a mechanical resonator ( mr ) could be probed in the phase noise of the cavity output light . apart from the above , more recently quantum estimation theory has been applied to discriminate the effect of cms  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we provide a novel scheme to test the cms by means of the steady - state entanglement of two macroscopic mrs .",
    "many protocols have been proposed for the generation of entanglement between two massive mrs using optomechanical and/or electromechanical systems , e.g. , by exploiting radiation pressure  @xcite , by transferring entanglement  @xcite or squeezing  @xcite from optical fields , by conditional measurements on light modes  @xcite , and by reservoir engineering realized by properly choosing multi - frequency drivings  @xcite .",
    "we will focus on the csl model which is one of the most widely studied cms .",
    "the scheme is based on the known fact that entanglement , as a kind of quantum correlations , is particularly sensitive to various noises .",
    "a small rise of noise may significantly degrade the entanglement .",
    "as is known , the collapse noise postulated in the cms is typically very small thus bringing the challenges for experimental verification . in view of these , entanglement could act as a perfect probe that may be able to sense whether the collapse noise is present or not .",
    "the reason we adopt _ steady - state _ entanglement is that , in order to efficiently test the cms , one should prepare entangled states lasting for a relatively long time  @xcite .",
    "we know that entanglement in steady states , rather than in transient states , is harder to prepare due to the continuous decoherence process interacting with various noises .",
    "the effect of the cms would be more noticeable in the steady - state entanglement due to the time accumulation effect .",
    "the system used to test the collapse theories should possess as small as possible environmental noises , comparable to the hypothetical collapse noise , and the test object should be large or massive enough yielding considerable collapse effect .",
    "levitated nanospheres  @xcite , owning very high mechanical quality factors , could be the ideal platform to implement such a test .",
    "protocols  @xcite have been provided using a single nanosphere trapped in a fabry - prot optical cavity that are able to test the strength of the collapse rate in the csl theory to values as low as @xmath0 hz with realistic parameters . in the present paper , here we study the effect of the csl on quantum correlations of two macroscopic objects . specifically",
    ", we employ two nanospheres optically trapped in a fabry - prot cavity and study the csl effect on the stationary entanglement of the center - of - mass motion of the two spheres .",
    "since the entanglement is particularly sensitive to noises , the diffusion rates of various noises in the system must be small .",
    "we find that , with properly chosen parameters , the collapse noise results in large reduction of the entanglement and the entanglement shows distinguishable scalings , with and without the csl effect , with certain system parameters , e.g. , the trapping frequency , due to the fact that different sources of noise exhibit different scalings with the system parameters  @xcite .",
    "the above observation can unambiguously determine whether the collapse noise is or is not actually present or effective .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ system ] we describe in detail our system , provide the quantum langevin equations for achieving the entanglement of the two nanospheres , and analyze the diffusion rates of various noises ( both environmental and the postulated collapse noise ) in the system . in sec .",
    "[ results ] we present the results and show the details of the parameters with which the csl effect with the corresponding value of the collapse rate could be determined . finally , sec .",

    "figure  [ fig2 ] is plotted as a function of the mechanical frequency @xmath17 which is a key parameter  @xcite and can be easily altered by adjusting the intensity of the trapping laser . under these conditions , one could see two distinguishable curves of the total diffusion rate with and without the csl effect ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( b ) ) which thereby result in distinguishable curves of the entanglement ( see the appendix for calculating the steady - state entanglement ) , as shown in fig .",

    "another efficient way to increase @xmath92 and meantime decrease @xmath20 is by lowering the trapping frequency @xmath17 .",

    "[ fig1 ] ) , and by changing the phases of the corresponding local oscillator , the quadratures of the two mrs , @xmath126 , are measured , and thus the covariance matrix of the quadratures is constructed , from which the entanglement can then be numerically obtained in the way introduced in the appendix .",
    "the probe fields will also induce mechanical diffusion due to the scattering of photons , however , it can be neglected if the probe fields are sufficiently weak .",
    "we have checked that in all plots of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , @xmath90 is always negligible compared to other diffusion rates , which means that even if the power of the probe field is equivalent to that of the driving laser , the diffusion induced by it is also negligible .",
    "we have suggested a scheme based on entangled levitating nanospheres to probe the possible effect of the csl theory .",
    "it is designed for nanospheres optically trapped in fabry - prot cavities , however , our scheme can also be applied to the system of magnetically trapped spheres , where the diffusion due to the scattering of trapping field will be significantly reduced  @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the steady - state entanglement of the center - of - mass motion of the two nanospheres is particularly sensitive to the noises in the system and the csl effect results in remarkably large reduction of the entanglement .",
    "the entanglement shows distinguishable scalings , with and without the csl effect , with the system parameter of the trapping frequency for the collapse rate down to @xmath127 hz , while it starts to show similar scalings for @xmath128 hz , implying that our scheme can _ unambiguously _ determine the csl effect for @xmath83 down to @xmath129 hz with realistic parameters and can also test it for @xmath128 hz , and even lower , if the difference of the entanglement caused by uncontrolled noises and the imprecision of measurements and parameter calibration is smaller than that induced by the csl effect .",
    "we notice that under the same conditions of the temperature and pressure , @xmath107 mk and @xmath108 torr , the present scheme is not as efficient as the one provided in ref .",
    "@xcite where the observable is instead the phase of the cavity output light .",
    "this is because , as mentioned at the beginning in sec .",
    "[ results ] , in order to have sizable entanglement a relatively small size of the sphere is adopted yielding a larger @xmath91 ( since @xmath99 ) , which eventually determines this scheme , based on entanglement , could not _ unambiguously _ probe the csl effect for @xmath83 down to @xmath0 hz , which however can be done by the scheme of ref .  @xcite .",
    "one promising solution is to employ the system of magnetically trapped spheres , e.g. , the proposal provided in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a superconducting microsphere is magnetically trapped close to a quantum circuit .",
    "in contrast with optical levitation , the main diffusion due to the scattering of trapping light is absent and the decoherence in the magnetic levitation system is predicted to be very small .",
    "the new system brings in additional sources of noise , e.g. , due to hysteresis losses in the superconducting coils , fluctuations in the trap frequency and trap center , however , all of them are predicted to be negligible  @xcite . adopting such a magnetic levitation scheme , the entanglement could be generated with ( much ) larger size of the spheres , which will significantly increase @xmath92 and meantime reduce @xmath91 . the csl effect with @xmath83 well below @xmath0 hz , if is present , is expected to be probed with realistic parameters .",
