    "the @xmath0 inflation @xcite is one of the oldest models of inflation @xcite proposed even before puzzles of the hot big bang cosmology , such as the horizon , flatness , homogeneity , isotropy , entropy , and monopole problems , were claimed to be solved by the quasi - exponential expansion of the universe @xcite . soon after the model was announced by starobinsky , mukhanov and chibisov @xcite realized that cosmological fluctuations resulting from quantum fluctuations were generated to seed the almost scale - invariant initial density fluctuations ( with a logarithmic dependence on wave number ) to form cosmic structures like galaxies and galactic clusters .",
    "the @xmath0 inflation is unique in the sense that the quasi - desitter phase is achieved only by gravitational degrees of freedom ; a homogeneous condensate of scalar gravitons ( dubbed _ scalarons _ ) slowly evolves to an oscillating phase and perturbatively decays into relativistic particles via production of conformally non - invariant particles that exist in the universe @xcite .",
    "observationally , anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) is measured in the full sky with multiple frequency bands and high precision by satellite missions , such as wmap @xcite and planck @xcite , to test inflationary predictions .",

    "it implies a slightly red spectrum with @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the number of e - folds at the cmb scale . with @xmath7 , for instance , @xmath8 , which is in good agreement with @xcite .",
    "even though high - precision observations have excluded many classes of inflationary models , some physics of inflation remain to be unveiled so as to further constrain the observationally qualified models , including the @xmath0 inflation .",
    "especially , the physics of reheating after inflation is not fully understood since fluctuations of matter fields or the inflaton itself would be enhanced by parametric resonances due to the oscillation of the inflaton , called _ preheating _",
    "@xcite ( also see @xcite for earlier works ) .",
    "understanding of the reheating epoch is getting more important as the precise value of @xmath6 depends on duration of this epoch and results in precise predictions of inflationary models .",
    "the nonlinear evolution of matter and/or inflaton fluctuations due to preheating , if it happens , changes the dynamics of the inflaton decay  @xcite and/or produces observable signals , such as gravitational waves on small scales @xcite .",
    "it has been pointed out that the non - perturbative effect enhances the inflaton fluctuations during the post - inflationary oscillation phase , such that the coherent inflaton field fragments into massive , long - lived , localized objects ( often called oscillons  @xcite or i - balls",
    "@xcite ) if the inflationary potential is shallower than quadratic away from the minimum  @xcite ( also see @xcite in different contexts ) .",
    "the shallow potentials include starobinsky s @xmath0 inflation model in the einstein frame .",
    "the oscillons / i - balls are the quasi - stable , spherical , soliton - like solution of non - linear scalar field excitations whose pressure from the gradient term is balanced with the attractive force from the shallower potential ; thus once they are formed , their decays are limited only on the surface with constant energy density decoupled from the hubble expansion . the decay rate of the inflaton is therefore significantly altered from the standard perturbative decay  @xcite .    in previous works  @xcite the criteria of formation of oscillons / i - balls were obtained .",
    "the floquet theory indicates that each k - mode of inflaton fluctuations has an exponential instability @xmath9 within the set of resonance bands during preheating , where @xmath3 is the inflaton mass , @xmath10 are periodic functions and @xmath11 is the floquet exponent .",
    "if @xmath12 is real and larger than the hubble rate @xmath13 at the end of inflation , the inhomogeneous @xmath14-mode can grow exponentially ; resonance generates large over - densities that may fragment into oscillons / i - balls . especially the fourth ref .  of",

    ", we study the dynamics of the inflaton field ( scalaron ) during the post - inflationary oscillation epoch after @xmath0 inflation  @xcite .",
    "this inflation model is highly motivated since it is parametrized only by one parameter and its prediction of the spectral index and the tensor - to - scalar ratio is located at the central value of observational results by wmap  @xcite and planck  @xcite . with the dust removal , which is in tension with the full - sky multiple - band temperature result of planck  @xcite .",
    "since bicep2 could reject the dust component only at 2.2@xmath16 , their result should be confirmed by other experiments  @xcite .",
    "] in addition , since the identity of the inflaton is homogeneous condensate of scalar gravitons , it universally interacts with elementary particles in the standard model ( and beyond ) , only with gravitational strength ; thus , the perturbative decay processes can be computed with the known parameters .",
    "however , the nonlinear evolution of the scalaron fluctuations themselves is yet fully understood .",
    "the potential of starobinsky s inflation is shallower than quadratic away from the minimum on the positive side ; thereby , the scalaron fluctuations could be amplified during the reheating epoch and fragment into quasi - stable lumps ( oscillons / i - balls ) . in this case , the perturbative analysis of reheating after @xmath0 inflation is significantly altered .",
