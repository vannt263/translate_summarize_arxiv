    "contemporary large galaxy redshift surveys , such as the sloan digital sky survey - iii ( sdss - iii ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , can map the 3d galaxy distribution in great detail .",
    "the line - of - sight ( los ) distances of the galaxies from the observer are usually obtained through galaxy redshifts .",
    "the observed redshift has two contributions , cosmological redshift from hubble expansion and doppler effect from the peculiar velocity of galaxies .",
    "the latter is related to the galaxy kinematics in various environments . in this paper , we present constraints on such kinematics from clustering of galaxies in the sdss - iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ; @xcite ) .",
    "the redshift - space distribution of galaxies is obtained by converting galaxy redshifts to distances under the assumption that the redshift is produced solely from the hubble expansion .",
    "the existence of the galaxy peculiar velocity distorts the galaxy distribution , leading to anisotropy .",
    "such a distortion is reflected in the redshift space as two main effects .",
    "on large scales , the infall of galaxies towards overdense regions as well as the streaming of galaxies out of underdense regions compresses their distribution towards overdense regions in the los direction ; this is known as the kaiser effect @xcite and was recognized in @xcite and @xcite . on small scales ,",
    "the random motion of galaxies in virialized structures causes the redshift - space distribution of galaxies to appear stretched along the los direction , producing the ` fingers - of - god ' ( fog ) feature @xcite .",
    "the above redshift - space distortion ( rsd ) effects can be measured in the two - point correlation function ( 2pcf ) of galaxies , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the transverse and los separations of galaxy pairs , respectively . in a contour plot of @xmath9",
    ", the kaiser effect causes the contours to be squashed along the los separation on large scales , and the fog effect shows up as elongated contours along the los separation at small @xmath10 .",
    "the fog effect was clearly detected even in early galaxy surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as a result of the relatively weak clustering amplitude on large scales ,",

    ", the nonlinear effect has to be taken into account , in addition to the kaiser effect .",
    "a simple streaming model is often used to describe the redshift - space clustering by convolving the real - space clustering with the galaxy pairwise velocity distribution @xcite .",
    "the velocity dispersion parameter introduced in such a model intends to capture the velocity dispersion of galaxies in nonlinear , virialized structures .",
    "however , such a velocity dispersion at most can be regarded as some sort of average and what it exactly refers to is not clear , since galaxy velocity dispersion depends on environment and scale , which are connected to the mass and size of their host dark matter haloes .",
    "one commonly used exponential dispersion ansatz can even lead to a non - physical distribution of pairwise velocities @xcite .",
    "the halo occupation distribution ( hod ) framework @xcite provides a more physical and informative approach to model galaxy clustering , including the rsd effects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the probability distribution @xmath12 and the spatial distribution of galaxies inside haloes , together with the halo population , are sufficient to model the real - space clustering ( e.g. , the projected 2pcf @xmath14 ) . to model the redshift - space clustering , the velocity distribution of galaxies inside haloes is required .",
    "we thus can potentially constrain the motion of galaxies inside haloes from measurements of the redshift - space clustering . with the increasing volume of contemporary galaxy redshift surveys",
    ", the precision of the data requires more accurate models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the effect of such velocity bias should appear in redshift - space clustering and be included in detailed modelling of the rsd .",

    ", we describe the data and the 2pcf measurements for a volume - limited luminosity threshold galaxy sample , and introduce our modelling method . in section 3 ,",

    "we focus in this paper on the analysis of a volume - limited boss cmass galaxy sample selected from the sdss - iii boss dr11 @xcite .",
    "the dr11 cmass galaxy sample covers an effective area of about @xmath22 and is designed to select massive galaxies of a typical stellar mass of @xmath23 .",
    "we construct a well - defined , volume - limited luminous red galaxy sample , satisfying the following selection criteria @xcite @xmath24 where the galactic extinction - corrected @xcite absolute magnitude @xmath25 and @xmath26 colour are both @xmath27 corrected to @xmath28 @xcite .",

    "this luminosity - threshold sample covers a volume of @xmath29 . with the complex sample selection ,",
    "the clustering of the full cmass sample , which is not volume - limited , is not straightforward to model , but given its key role in constraining cosmological parameters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we also present in appendix  [ app : full ] the modelling results of the full cmass sample in the redshift range of @xmath30 .    when performing the 2pcf measurements , we follow @xcite and employ the fibre - collision correction method of @xcite .",
    "we also make use of a collision - free galaxy sample from one of the ancillary programme of the boss to further test the correction method and confirm that it is working well ( see appendix  [ app : fiber ] ) .",
    "we measure the redshift - space 3d 2pcf @xmath9 using the landy ",
    "szalay estimator @xcite . to produce a quantity less affected by rsd effects",
    ", we project the 2pcf along the los direction to obtain the projected 2pcf @xmath14 @xcite , which is defined as @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the @xmath34th bin of the los separation and its corresponding bin size .",
    "we set @xmath10 in logarithmic bins centred at @xmath35 to @xmath36 with @xmath37 , and @xmath11 in linear bins from 0 to 100@xmath38 with @xmath39 .",
    "the sum of @xmath9 along the los direction is formed up to @xmath40 , which is large enough to include most of the correlated pairs .",
    "we further measure the redshift - space 2pcf in bins of @xmath41 and @xmath42 , where @xmath43 and @xmath42 is the cosine of the angle between @xmath41 and the los direction .",
    "following @xcite , the redshift - space 2pcf @xmath44 can be written in the form of a multipole expansion , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the @xmath47-th order legendre polynomial and the multipole moment @xmath48 is calculated through @xmath49 the last equality is how we compute the multipole moments , with @xmath50 and @xmath51 the @xmath34-th @xmath42 bin and bin width .",
    "similar to @xmath10 , we set @xmath41 in logarithmic bins centred at @xmath35 to @xmath36 with @xmath52 .",
    "for @xmath42 , we use linear bins from -1 to 1 with @xmath53 .    in linear theory , only the monopole ( @xmath54 ) , quadrupole ( @xmath55 ) , and hexadecapole ( @xmath56 ) are non - zero . in this paper , we perform joint modelling of @xmath57 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 to constrain the hod , including the mean occupation function and velocity distribution of galaxies inside haloes .        to ensure an accurate hod modelling of the clustering measurements , we adopt a simulation - based model , presented in detail in zheng & guo ( in preparation ) . in brief , to compute galaxy 2pcfs , we tabulate all necessary elements of dark matter haloes in a simulation in fine mass bins ( @xmath58 in this paper ) and adopt the same binning scheme as in the measurements . specifically , we tabulate different 2pcf components from particles representing the one - halo central - central , central - satellite pairs and the two - halo central - central , central - satellite , and satellite - satellite pairs .",
    "the model 2pcf for the galaxies is then obtained as the sum of these 2pcf components weighted by the corresponding mean occupation function from the hod prescription .",
    "this method is accurate and fast in computing the galaxy 2pcf , because it automatically and accurately accounts for the effects halo exclusion , nonlinear growth , and scale - dependent halo bias .",
    "this simulation - based model is equivalent to creating mock galaxy samples by populating the haloes in the simulation with galaxies for a given hod prescription , while it is way faster in computing the 2pcf .",
    "detailed explanation and tests of this method can be found in zheng & guo ( in preparation ) .    in this paper ,",
    "we build our model based on the multidark run simulation ( mdr1;@xcite ) .",
    "we use its output at @xmath59 to match the redshift of cmass galaxies .",
    "this @xmath3-body @xmath15cdm cosmological simulation adopts the following cosmological parameters : @xmath16 , @xmath18 , @xmath17 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "the simulation has 2048@xmath60 dark matter particles in a box of 1@xmath61gpc on a side .",
    "the mass of the dark matter particle is @xmath62 @xmath61 m@xmath63 . in our fiducial model , we use dark matter haloes identified with the spherical overdensity ( so ) algorithm ( bound density maximum technique as described in @xcite ) in mdr1 .",
    "the so haloes are defined to have a mean density @xmath64 times that of the background universe , where @xmath65 at @xmath59 for mdr1 @xcite .    for each halo , we define its centre ( the position to place a central galaxy ; see below ) as the position of the dark matter particle with the minimal potential .",
    "we also need to define a characteristic halo velocity .",
    "the velocity corresponding to the minimal potential position is not well determined , since the mean velocity of dark matter particles around it depends on radius ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we therefore adopt a velocity for the core of the halo , determined from the bulk velocity of the inner @xmath66 per cent of halo particles around the above centre .",
    "using the inner @xmath66 per cent of the halo particles is representative of the halo centre , while relatively insensitive to resolution effects of the simulation used .",
    "the velocity of the central galaxy will be formulated with respect to this core velocity , and can also be translated to the one relative to the centre - of - mass halo velocity ( corresponding to the bulk velocity of @xmath67 per cent halo particles ) .",
    "although the centre - of - mass velocity is commonly used to characterize the halo velocity , the core velocity is more informative as it relates to the distribution of particles in the inner part of a halo , which acts as the immediate environment of the central galaxy .",
    "we note that our definition of the halo velocity differs from that of @xcite , but when converted to the same definition the results on velocity bias are consistent ( see details in appendix [ app : full ] ) . to investigate the effect of halo definition in our analysis , we also present modelling results in a few cases for haloes identified by a friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm with a linking length of @xmath68 in mdr1 .",
    "for further details on the multidark simulation , we refer the readers to @xcite .",
    "since the measurements are all produced from redshift - space 2pcfs , we build our simulation tables in redshift space as well .",
    "given the narrow redshift range considered in this paper , we adopt the plane - parallel approximation and use the @xmath69 direction in the simulation as the los . in redshift space ,",
    "the shift ( in comoving units ) in the position of a galaxy particle in the @xmath69 direction is calculated as @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the los peculiar velocity of the particle , and @xmath72 is the hubble constant at redshift @xmath59 .",
    "the peculiar velocity in our table includes the effect of velocity bias ( see below ) .",
    "the simulation tables have all the one - halo and two - halo components of @xmath57 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 .      for the hod prescription , we separate the contribution to the occupation number into those from central galaxies and satellites @xcite .",
    "we follow the hod parametrization of @xcite for the central and satellite mean occupation functions , @xmath73 and @xmath74 , @xmath75 , \\label{eqn : ncen}\\\\ \\langle n_{\\rm sat}(m)\\rangle&=&\\langle n_{\\rm cen}(m)\\rangle\\left(\\frac{m - m_0}{m_1^\\prime}\\right)^\\alpha , \\label{eqn : nsat}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 is the error function , @xmath77 describes the cutoff halo mass of the central galaxies and @xmath78 is the width of the cutoff profile .",
    "the three parameters for the satellite galaxies are the cutoff mass scale @xmath79 , the normalization mass scale @xmath80 and the high - mass slope @xmath81 of @xmath74 .    in the simulation - based model , in each halo hosting a galaxy in our sample we assign the central galaxy to reside at the centre of the halo ( defined as the position of potential minimum ) . for satellite galaxies , in our fiducial model , we assign the positions of randomly selected dark matter particles from the halo .",
    "our model preserves the non - spherical shapes of haloes .",
    "the assumption that the spatial distribution of satellite galaxies inside haloes follows that of the dark matter is tested and discussed in section [ sec : sys ] .    to assign velocities to central and satellite galaxies ,",
    "we introduce two additional hod parameters to account for the possible differences in the velocity distributions of galaxies and dark matter inside haloes ( a.k.a .",
    "velocity bias ) .",
    "the two velocity bias parameters , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , apply to central and satellite galaxies , respectively .    for each halo in the simulation",
    ", we measure the 1d velocity dispersion @xmath84 of dark matter particles . the central galaxy particle ( at the potential minimum )",
    "is then assigned a los velocity ( with respect to the core velocity of the halo ) following a gaussian distribution with zero mean and standard deviation of @xmath85 this accounts for the possibility that the central galaxy may not be at rest with respect to the core .    to incorporate the velocity bias for satellite galaxies ,",
    "the los velocity @xmath86 of each satellite is assigned through @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the los velocity of the halo core and @xmath89 is the original los velocity of the dark matter particle that represents the galaxy , i.e. in the rest frame of the halo core , the velocity of the satellite galaxy differs from that of the dark matter particle by a factor of @xmath83 .",
    "and the consequence is that the 1d velocity dispersion @xmath90 of satellite galaxies is a factor of @xmath83 times that of the dark matter particles , @xmath91 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to the velocity related to the velocity bias , we also incorporate into the model the dispersion caused by the measurement error in the redshifts of cmass galaxies . from galaxies with repeated observations , we find that the root - mean - square ( rms ) redshift error corresponds to a los velocity dispersion of @xmath92 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , in building our simulation tables , we add to each ( central or satellite ) galaxy particle a los velocity , drawing from a gaussian distribution with a zero mean and a standard deviation of @xmath93 .",
    "we emphasize that even though we phrase the velocity bias as a modification to the los velocities ( equations  [ eqn : alpha_c ] and [ eqn : alpha_s ] ) , it applies to all the three velocity components , i.e. the velocity bias is for the 3d velocity of galaxies .",
    "for the purpose of modelling redshift - space clustering , however , only the los component matters .",
    "the velocity bias effects have been incorporated in the simulation tables in our model .",
    "we construct tables for @xmath82 in the range of @xmath94 $ ] and @xmath83 in @xmath95 $ ] in bins of @xmath96 .",
    "the model interpolates among these tables for any given values of @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "we have verified that using smaller bin sizes for the interpolation does not produce any significant difference in the results . in total , our fiducial model has seven free hod parameters , five for the mean occupation function and two for the velocity bias .",
    "the two velocity bias parameters are the key parameters we aim to constrain in this paper .",
    "a model with no velocity bias corresponds to @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "as shown in the next section , the measurements in cmass galaxies in fact require substantial velocity bias .        in our modelling of the clustering measurements ,",
    "we apply a markov chain monte carlo method to explore the hod parameter space .",
    "we jointly fit the projected 2pcf @xmath14 , the redshift - space multipoles @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 , and the observed number density @xmath105 of galaxies in the sample .",
    "the @xmath106 of the fitting is defined as @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the full error covariance matrix and the data vector @xmath109 $ ] , i.e. the combination of the measurements of the projected 2pcf and redshift - space 2pcf multipoles . the quantity with ( without ) a superscript ` @xmath110 ' is the one from the measurement ( model ) .",
    "[ fig : xipfull ] shows the 3d 2pcf @xmath9 for the full sample .",
    "compared to the volume - limited @xmath111 sample in fig .",
    "[ fig : xip ] , the full sample has a slightly weaker fog effect .",
    "this is a reflection of the fact that the full sample includes galaxies of lower luminosity and bluer colour , both of which have slower motions in haloes , leading to a weaker fog feature . on large scales ,",
    "the full sample has a stronger kaiser effect , which can also be attributed to the inclusion of galaxies of lower luminosity and bluer colour , that have lower galaxy bias factors .",
    "we present in fig .",
    "[ fig : wpxifull ] and table  [ tab : full ] the modelling results for the full sample in the redshift range of @xmath30 .",
    "the larger volume ( @xmath114 ) leads to tighter constraints on the velocity bias parameters , as shown by the solid black contours in the bottom right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : wpxifull ] . compared to the volume - limited @xmath111 sample ,",
    "the velocity bias constraints tend to shift to slightly higher @xmath82 and lower @xmath83 , but are still consistent with those from the @xmath111 sample .",
    "to investigate the robustness of the constraints of velocity bias in the full sample , we present the results of two additional tests in the bottom right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : wpxifull ] .",
    "one assumes a higher number density of the full sample , @xmath115 , as suggested by @xcite , i.e. the observed full sample is regarded as a random subsample of a larger ` parent ' sample .",
    "this test is nearly equivalent to the case of keeping the original number density but setting a less - than - unity asymptotic value of the high - mass end central occupation function , as done with our volume - limited sample (   [ sec : sys ] ) .",
    "the results are also similar , leading only to a slight shift in the central velocity bias ( dotted red contours ) .",
    "the other test is to constrain the velocity bias using the full sample limited to the ` complete - sector sample ' that is free of fibre collisions .",
    "the results here are also similar to those of the analogous test done with the volume - limited sample (   [ sec : sys ] ) ; we do not find substantial changes in the velocity bias constraints ( dotted blue contours ) .",
    "recently , @xcite performed modelling of the small- to intermediate - scale anisotropic clustering measurement for the full sample of cmass dr10 galaxies to constrain @xmath116 .",
    "they model modified monopole and quadrupole moments , which effectively remove pairs in the fog regime and thus slightly weaken the constraining power on the velocity bias compared to our modelling . in their one case with velocity bias constraints , they infer @xmath117 , consistent with no central velocity bias . most of the discrepancy with our results can be accounted for by the use of different reference frames to define the velocity bias . while we use the inner 25 per cent particles around the potential minimum to define the core , they use the inner 3.75 per cent particles .",
    "there is a relative motion between the cores defined in these two ways @xcite .",
    "accounting for this , we find that the two results for the central galaxy velocity bias are fully consistent . in other words , in a common frame , the centre - of - mass frame of haloes , both become @xmath118",
    ".    the choice of the inner 3.75 per cent of particles in @xcite ( about 6 per cent of @xmath119 ) may serve as a guess for using dark matter structures ( in dark matter only simulations ) to represent central galaxies .",
    "however , realistically , the small central region is likely affected by baryonic processes , which makes the connection between dark matter only structures and galaxies less evident . for our choice of 25 per cent of the particles ( about 27 per cent of @xmath119 ) , the core is less sensitive to baryonic effects .",
    "another advantage of this choice is that such a core can be well identified even in low resolution simulations , which is useful for modelling galaxy clustering in large redshift surveys ( like boss and future extensions ) . while , for simplicity , one can define the velocity bias in the centre - of - mass frame of the haloes , defining a core component provides more information on the relation between central galaxies and the dark matter distribution ."
