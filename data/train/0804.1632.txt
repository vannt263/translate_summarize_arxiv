    "the amount of metals in the intracluster medium ( icm ) and in the intragroup medium ( igm ) gives us important clues about the past star formation activity of the stellar population of these galaxy systems , being it directly linked to the total number of supernovae exploded in the past and to the initial stellar mass function of the star formation epoch ( e.g. , renzini et al .",
    "the metal content can also enlight how the enrichment proceeded , e.g. , via stripping or galactic winds driven by sne or agn feedback , and has implications for both the icm / igm and galaxy evolution ( e.g. , wu , fabian , & nulsen 2000 ; finoguenov et al .",

    "similarly to the metal abundance , the hot icm / igm temperature is also one of the most important and commonly used global observables : it is used as a proxy for the total mass of the system ( e.g. , voit 2005 ) , from which the clusters can be used as probes for fundamental cosmological parameters ( e.g. , henry & arnaud 1991 , henry 1997 , nevalainen et al .",

    "since the icm / igm are not isothermal , ideally the mass weighted temperature should enter the computation of quantities to be used for cosmological tests .    from a more quantitative point of view , the amount of the mass of metals in the icm / igm is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the true three dimensional gas density and abundance profiles .",

    "[ res ] ) .",
    "vikhlinin ( 2006 ) extended this previous work and proposed an algorithm to accurately predict @xmath34 that would be derived for a plasma with components in a wider range of temperatures ( @xmath35 kev ) and arbitrary abundances of heavy elements . from the analysis of mock spectra of simulated clusters , it was found that @xmath34 is lower than the emission weighted temperature @xmath36 , with consequences for using the observed @xmath37 relation to infer the amplitude of the power spectrum of primordial fluctuations ( rasia et al . 2005 ) .    here , extending the preliminary discussion of pellegrini & ciotti ( 2002 ) based on spherical models , we estimate how much discrepant @xmath27 and @xmath15 , and @xmath36 ( or @xmath34 ) and @xmath16 are , by using different plausible profiles for @xmath10 , @xmath17 and @xmath26 obtained assuming hydrostatic equilibrium within triaxial mass distributions resembling real systems . in particular",
    "the models are constructed by using a technique that allows for building analytical barotropic gas distributions with prescribed density profiles departing from spherical symmetry .",
    "these new models extend the class of equilibria usually considered in the literature beyond isothermal or polytropic models ( i.e. , suto , sasaki & makino 1998 ; pellegrini & ciotti 2002 ; lee & suto 2003 , 2004 ; ostriker , bode & babul 2005 ; ascasibar & diego 2007 ) . in the computation of the averages ,",
    "our approach takes also advantage of the projection theorem , from which it follows that @xmath27 and @xmath36 are independent of the specific direction of the line - of - sight , and can be calculated using the intrinsic three - dimensional quantities of the models , with a much easier procedure that avoids projection and surface integration .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the models of the dark matter halos and the procedure to build fully analytical hydrostatic configurations in potentials of triaxial shape , for gas distributions corresponding to truncated quasi - isothermal models , quasi - polytropic models and modified @xmath38 models . in section 3",
    "we describe the results and in section 4 we summarize the main conclusions ; technical results are reported in the appendix .",
    "the density of the ( dark ) mass distribution is the generalization to the triaxial case of the so - called @xmath39-models ( dehnen 1993 , tremaine et al .",
    "1994 ) : @xmath40 where @xmath41    @xmath42 is the total dark mass of the system , @xmath43 is a characteristic scale , and the pair @xmath44 parameterizes the flattening along the @xmath45 and @xmath46 axes respectively .",
    "the mass distribution is spherically symmetric when @xmath47 , and @xmath42 remains constant for different choices of the flattening . for simplicity ,",
    "we restrict to the @xmath48 and the @xmath49 cases : in the former , the density profile shows a central `` core '' , while in the latter the hernquist ( 1990 ) profile is recovered in the spherical limit .",
    "note that the @xmath49 models have the same radial trend , in the central regions , as the profile obtained from high resolution cosmological simulations ( dubinsky & carlberg 1991 ; navarro , frenk & white 1996 ) , while they are steeper at large radii ( @xmath50 instead of @xmath51 ) . even though not required by the technique described in sect .",
    "2.2 , in our analysis we used the potential profiles obtained by means of homeoidal expansions of the true potential at fixed total mass ( e.g. , muccione & ciotti 2003 , 2004 ; lee & suto 2003 , 2004 ; ciotti & bertin 2005 , hereafter cb05 ) .",
    "this approach has the advantage of avoiding the numerical integration needed to recover the potential ( e.g. binney & tremaine 2008 ) , and the formulae obtained are a very good approximation of the exact potential associated with eq .",

    "are normalized to @xmath43 , and in both cases the expansion holds for @xmath58 ( see appendix a in cb05 ) .",
    "thus , in principle the maximum deviation from spherical symmetry is obtained for @xmath59 , corresponding to a prolate system of axis ratio 2:1 .",
    "finally , the virial temperature of the system ( defined as @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the gravitational energy ) in the limit of small flattenings , and independently of the specific density profile @xmath62 , is given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the mean particle weight , @xmath65 is the proton mass , @xmath66 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath67 is the virial radius of @xmath68 in the spherical limit ( muccione & ciotti 2004 ) . here",

    "we also derived the commonly used @xmath90 and @xmath91 radii ( within which the average mass density is respectively 200 and 500 times the critical density at redshift zero for a flat @xmath76cdm cosmological model ) . independently of @xmath48 or @xmath49 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 for @xmath94 , and @xmath95 and @xmath96 for @xmath87 .",
    "remarkably , the ratios @xmath97 and @xmath98 are very similar to those typical of the navarro et al .",

    "once a dark matter distribution is chosen , we build hydrostatic equilibrium models for the gas within it , assuming that the gas mass does not contribute to the gravitational field , and that the gas is perfect so that its pressure is @xmath99 .",
    "our procedure is based on the well known result that pressure , density and temperature in hydrostatic equilibrium are all stratified over isopotential surfaces ( e.g. , tassoul 1980 ) varies , it is actually the ratio @xmath100 to be stratified over the isopotential surfaces , but here we neglect the very small @xmath101 variations due to the adopted abundance gradients . ] . in other words ,",
    "hydrostatic configurations are _ barotropic _ , i.e. @xmath102 , which allows us to solve the hydrostatic equation @xmath103 for potentials of _ general _ shape .",
    "therefore , the method is fully general : the only additional simplifying assumption is that the potential has a finite minimum @xmath104 at the center and vanishes at infinity . with this method we could also study the effect of substructures by superimposing different , off - centered dark - matter halos .",
    "the following is a family of exact equilibria that generalizes the classical isothermal models @xmath105 where @xmath10 is the isothermal equilibrium stratification of temperature @xmath106 in a generic potential @xmath107 , and @xmath104 and @xmath108 are ( for example ) the central potential and the central gas density . as usual for isothermal equilibria",

    "this should be done preserving the barotropicity of the distribution . in practice",

    "the maximum flattening of the gas distribution is @xmath125 in the @xmath126 plane , while in the @xmath127 case the maximum gas flattening is @xmath128 .",

    "the reason for this lies in the well known fact that the gas density and temperature distributions are stratified on equipotential surfaces , that are much less flattened than the mass distribution that produces them ( e.g. , binney & tremaine 2008 ) .",
