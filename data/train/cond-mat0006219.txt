    "grain boundaries in high-@xmath4 cuprates are interesting and important for both fundamental physics and applications of high - temperature superconductivity.@xcite conventional models of strongly coupled josephson junctions are applicable to describe electromagnetic properties of grain boundaries in thin films of high-@xmath4 superconductors.@xcite a remarkable exception of this rule is the [ 001]-tilt boundary in yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 films with a misorientation angle close to 45@xmath5.@xcite indeed , these grain boundaries have an anomalous dependence of the critical current @xmath6 on an applied magnetic field @xmath7 . contrary to a usual fraunhofer - type dependence @xmath8 with a major central peak at @xmath9 and minor symmetric side - peaks the asymmetric 45@xmath5 [ 001]-tilt grain boundaries demonstrate a pattern without a central dominant peak .",
    "instead two symmetric major side - peaks appear at certain applied magnetic fields @xmath10.@xcite    several mechanisms have been suggested to explain this phenomena .",
    "@xcite the anomalous dependence @xmath8 with symmetric major side - peaks is obviously a result of a specific heterogeneity of electrical properties of the asymmetric 45@xmath5 [ 001]-tilt grain boundaries .",
    "two fundamental experimental observations in conjunction explain this heterogeneity in a natural way.@xcite _ first _ , a fine scale faceting of grain boundaries was discovered in experiments using the transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) technique .",
    "@xcite these facets have a typical length - scale @xmath11 of the order of 10100 nm and a wide variety of orientations relative to the axis of symmetry of the superconductor . _",
    "second _ , quite a few of recent experiments provide an evidence of a predominant @xmath12 wave symmetry of the order parameter in many of the high-@xmath4 cuprates . in some experimental studies",
    "the symmetry of the order parameter is more complicated and is shown to be a certain mixture of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 wave components.@xcite    these two fundamental experimental observations indicate the existence of two contributions to the phase difference of the order parameter across the grain boundary . indeed , consider a meandering grain boundary in a film of a superconductor with the @xmath12 wave symmetry of the order parameter and assume that there is a certain magnetic flux inside the grain boundary .",
    "in this case there is a phase difference @xmath14 caused by the magnetic flux and at the same time there is an additional phase difference @xmath15 caused by the misalignment of the anisotropic @xmath12 wave superconductors .",
    "therefore , the tunneling current density @xmath16 is defined by the total phase difference @xmath17 . a model describing this josephson current density @xmath18 results from an assumption that @xmath19 $ ] , where @xmath20 is along the grain boundary line.@xcite the local values of the phase difference @xmath21 depend on the relative orientation of neighboring facets . in the case of an asymmetric 45@xmath5 grain boundary we have @xmath22 or @xmath23 , and therefore @xmath24.@xcite in other words in the framework of a model relating @xmath18 to the orientation of the facets we arrive to @xmath25 with an alternating critical current density @xmath26 .",
    "the dependence @xmath3 is imposed by the sequence of facets along a grain boundary line .",

    "i.e. _ , this length - scale is of 10100 nm .",
    "variation of orientation of facets along a meandering grain boundary leads to formation of local superconducting current loops even in the absence of an applied magnetic field if the total phase difference @xmath27 .",
    "it was predicted , in particular , that these current loops can generate a certain magnetic flux at a contact of two facets with @xmath28 and @xmath29.@xcite    self - generated randomly distributed magnetic flux was discovered in asymmetric 45@xmath5 [ 001]-tilt grain boundaries in yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 superconducting films in the absence of an applied external magnetic field.@xcite this flux @xmath30 changes its sign randomly and has an amplitude of variations less than the flux quantum @xmath31 .",
    "the average value of @xmath30 along the grain boundary is nearly zero .",
    "noticeable , that this disordered non - quantized magnetic flux was observed only for the samples exhibiting the anomalous dependence of the critical current @xmath8 on magnetic field with the two symmetric major side - peaks .",
    "it was shown analytically that under certain conditions a stationary state with a self - generated flux exists for a josephson junction with a periodically alternating critical current density @xmath3.@xcite the same spatial distributions of @xmath3 result in an anomalous dependence of the critical current @xmath8 on the applied magnetic field.@xcite numerical calculations show that two symmetric major side - peaks appear for a periodically alternating @xmath3 .",
    "the randomness of the critical current density @xmath3 smears these peaks but leaves their position in place at weak randomness .",
    "we therefore conclude that the experimental observation of the well pronounced major side - peaks on the curve @xmath8 @xcite means that the alternating critical current density is a periodic or almost periodic function of @xmath20 .",
