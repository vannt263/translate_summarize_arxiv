    "the 2007 glitch of psr j1119 - 6127 is unusual and interesting as the first case with clear indications of changing pulsar emission properties coincident with the glitch .",
    "the event is also unusual in its long term signature of _ decreased _ spin - down rate .",
    "these signatures require an extension of the vortex creep model which has become the standard model for evaluating glitches and post - glitch response .",
    "the extension of the model must also make allowance for changes in the pulsar torque suggested by the glitch related changes in emission properties .",
    "glitches are sudden increases in the rotation rate of pulsars followed by relaxation towards the pre - glitch state .",
    "the fractional change of the angular velocity , @xmath5 , in a glitch is in the range @xmath6 .",
    "glitches are usually accompanied by jumps in the spin - down rate , @xmath7 , in the range @xmath8 .",
    "to date , about 400 glitches have been observed in more than a hundred pulsars @xcite . since the earliest glitch observations",
    ", the sudden changes in rotation frequency and spin - down rate were seen to relax back towards the pre - glitch values on timescales of days to years .",
    "this is interpreted as a signature of superfluid interior components of the neutron star @xcite , as a star composed of normal matter would relax much faster .",
    "several models have been proposed to explain glitches and post - glitch relaxation . in the early starquake model @xcite , the solid crust of the neutron star occasionally cracks under stresses induced by the ongoing spin - down of the star , thereby readjusting to a less oblate shape closer to the equilibrium shape that a fluid star would follow while spinning down . by conservation of angular momentum ,",
    "the reduction in moment of inertia of the crust is accompanied by an increase in its angular velocity .",
    "glitches in the crab pulsar @xcite and psr j0537 - 6910 @xcite can be explained by this model .",
    "however , starquakes can not explain large glitches that repeat every few years , as exhibited by the vela pulsar @xcite .",
    "the required rate of dissipation of elastic energy stored in the solid crust would produce an x - ray luminosity enhancement which is not observed @xcite .",
    "the standard model for the pulsar glitches is the vortex pinning@xmath9unpinning ( vortex creep ) model based on the dynamics of the neutron star s superfluid interior @xcite .",
    "this model invokes the minimal storage and dissipation of energy for a star with angular momentum .",
    "the expected energy dissipation in a large glitch , at the expense of the rotational kinetic energies of the two components , does not violate any observational upper bounds .",
    "models based on pinned superfluid components can explain the various modes of glitch and post - glitch behaviour @xcite .",
    "radio pulsar glitches observed up to the 2007 glitch of psr j1119 - 6127 @xcite showed no glitch correlated changes in the electromagnetic signatures , like pulse shape , emission pattern , spectrum and polarization .",
    "previous applications of the vortex creep and starquake models assumed that there were no changes in the pulsar torque at the time of the glitch .",
    "glitches and post - glitch response were explained entirely in terms of the internal structure and dynamics of the neutron star .",

    "the high magnetic field radio pulsar psr j1846 - 0258 had comparable glitch - induced emission changes @xcite .",
    "the radio pulsar psr j0742 - 2822 showed a suggestive connection between changing radio emission and pulse shape features and glitch activity , however there is currently little direct evidence to establish a robust link between them due to absence of enough data following the glitch date @xcite .",
    "the rrat j1819 - 1458 was also reported to have an increase in its activity associated with a glitch @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the 2007 glitch of psr j1119 - 6127 and extend the vortex creep model to include the possibility of a sudden change in the pulsar torque associated with the glitch , as suggested by the changing emission properties , and to address the atypical glitch signature . in  [ sec : glitch ] we summarize the unique properties of the 2007 glitch of psr j1119 - 6127 . in  [ sec : overview ] we review the vortex creep model , while in  [ sec : extension ] we develop the model to include the unusual signatures in the spin frequency and spin - down rate , and allow for glitch associated changes in the pulsar torque .",

    "the 2007 glitch of psr j1119 - 6127 is a  vela - like \" giant glitch from a _ young _ pulsar comparable to the crab pulsar in characteristic age .",
    "the radio emission properties of psr j1119 - 6127 displayed changes associated with the glitch .",
    "the pulsar switched on intermittent pulses and also showed rrat behaviour which seems to have emerged with the glitch .",
    "this anomalous emission behaviour of psr j1119 - 6127 was observed for about three months following the 2007 glitch .",
    "the much smaller second glitch which occurred in 2004 may have had similar signatures in the long term post - glitch frequency and frequency derivative remnants @xcite .",
    "the data is sparse , and post - glitch evolution may have been interrupted by the arrival of the 2007 glitch .",
    "furthermore , no glitch associated changes in emission properties were observed for the 2004 glitch .",
    "here we address only the 2007 glitch .",
    "the vortex creep model @xcite attempts to explain the processes which cause both the glitches and the post - glitch relaxation in terms of a number of distinct superfluid regions in the inner crust .",
    "the superfluid core of the neutron star is coupled to the external torque on very short timescales , via electron scattering off magnetized vortices @xcite .",
    "the core superfluid therefore behaves as part of the effective normal matter crust .",
    "hence the superfluid component relevant for glitch and postglitch dynamics is the crust superfluid .",
    "a description of the core superfluid blue as well as the crustal superfluid in terms of mutual friction forces acting upon vortex lines is given by @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the crust superfluid is constrained by the pinning of the quantized vortex lines to nuclei , interstitial positions and possibly other structures in the crust lattice @xcite .",
    "when vortices pin to nuclei , they move with the crust s velocity .",
    "a lag @xmath22 builds up between the superfluid and the crustal angular velocities @xmath23 and @xmath24 as the crust spins down under the external pulsar torque .",

    "the magnitude of the required pinning force ( per unit length ) is @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the distance from rotation axis , @xmath27 is superfluid density , @xmath28 is the quantum of vorticity .",
    "the critical ( maximum ) lag , @xmath29 , determined by the maximum available pinning force , is given by @xmath30 . here",
    "@xmath31 is pinning energy , @xmath32 is the vortex core radius and @xmath33 is the distance between successive pinning sites along the vortex line .",
    "if local fluctuations in vortex density and superfluid velocity raise @xmath34 above @xmath29 , there will be sudden unpinning and outward motion which can lead to an avalanche of vortex discharge @xcite . by conservation of angular momentum",
    "this leads to speeding up of the crust , @xmath35 , observed as a glitch .",
    "the possibility of such vortex unpinning avalanches taking place spontaneously was confirmed by computer simulations @xcite .",
    "apart from the discontinuous angular momentum imparted to the crust by sudden vortex unpinning at glitches , the superfluid also spins down continuously between glitches by outward flow of vortices .",
    "the crustal neutron superfluid follows the spin - down of the crust by means of thermally activated outward creep of vortex lines against the pinning energy barriers @xcite .    in terms of a simple two component model , involving the crust and the superfluid component , the observed spin - down of a neutron star s crust satisfies",

    "glitches set the system off from steady state .",
    "post - glitch relaxation is due to the recovery of vortex creep , as the lag @xmath34 inevitably builds back towards steady state due to the ongoing spin - down of the crust under the external pulsar torque .",
    "the internal torque is so sensitively dependent on the pinning energy @xmath31 and the crustal temperature @xmath46 that we expect vortex lines in the different regions of the superfluid to respond differently .",
    "depending on the temperature and the local pinning parameters in relation to the external torque , vortex creep can have a linear or nonlinear dependence on the lag @xcite . in the linear regime ,",
    "the response is linear in the glitch - induced perturbation to the lag @xmath47 and gives simple exponential relaxation .",

    "@xcite fit their data set with two models , model a with a long term exponential relaxation , and model b with a negative frequency second derivative ( @xmath151 in their notation ) .",
    "the positive @xmath152 decays towards zero in both models , asymptotically in the case of model a. the two models leave comparable residuals . our investigation of crust breaking , giving a permanent change in the external torque and spin - down rate and causing inward vortex motion , is complementary to their work .",
    "future timing observations will decide if the offset in the spin - down rate is really permanent or relaxing ; and searches for thermal signals accompanying future glitches of psr j1119 - 6127 will distinguish between the different models .",
    "we must use the long term remnant of the frequency glitch in eq .",
    "( 13 ) to constrain @xmath70 and @xmath93 , the moments of inertia of superfluid regions which transfer angular momentum _ only _ at glitches , due to the outward and inward motion of unpinned vortices , respectively . using the values of @xmath77 and @xmath153 from table 2",
    "leads to the constraint @xmath154 .",
    "this gives @xmath155 .",
    "then the superfluid creep regions with a total moment of inertia @xmath156 is effected by the glitch event . the region with moment of inertia @xmath157 comprises most of the moment of inertia in pinned superfluid .",
    "recent calculations @xcite show that bragg scattering of conduction neutrons from nuclei in the neutron star crust induces a neutron effective mass that is larger than the bare mass .",
    "this  entrainment \" of superfluid neutrons in the crust by the crystal lattice requires that the actual moment of inertia associated with the superfluid response is larger by a factor @xmath158 where @xmath159 and @xmath160 are effective and bare neutron masses in the lattice .",
    "the moment of inertia @xmath161 associated with creep can not be accommodated by the _ crust _ superfluid alone for most neutron star models , even without the effective mass correction .",
    "in addition to the crust superfluid , other locations are required to sustain vortex creep .",
    "contribution from vortex line - toroidal flux line pinning and creep at the outer - core of the neutron star @xcite , which has a comparable or larger moment of inertia than that of the crust superfluid , could provide the required extra moment of inertia @xcite .",
    "the moment of inertia of the creep region where vortex motion is controlled by the toroidal arrangement of flux lines can amount to @xmath162 depending on the radial extension of the toroidal field in the outer core .",
    "creep here is in the non - linear regime .",
    "as no glitch associated vortex motion is expected , the response to a glitch is exponential relaxation @xcite .",
    "the relaxation time @xmath163 days for psr j1119 - 6117 parameters is in line with our estimate of @xmath164 days ( and with @xmath165 days for the application to the vela pulsar , which has parameters similar to those of psr j1119 - 6117 ; @xcite ) .",
    "so , we argue that @xmath166 reflects the moment of inertia associated with the toroidal flux line region of the outer core .",
    "the moment of inertia of the _ crustal _ superfluid participating in the glitch , when the crustal entrainment correction is included , is @xmath167 .",
    "this total moment of inertia fraction can be accommodated in the crust in neutron star models with hard equations of state , if the mean value of @xmath168 to represent the crust superfluid is not much larger than 1 .",
    "the recent work of @xcite shows that the neutron star crust may maintain larger moment of inertia so that the above constraint is easier to be satisfied .",
    "the total numbers of vortices displaced in this glitch are determined by the superfluid angular velocity changes @xmath77 and @xmath153 using eq .",
    "the number of vortices that have moved outward is found to be is @xmath169 , while the corresponding number for inward moving vortices is @xmath170 .",
    "these numbers are typical of all small or large glitches , from crab , vela and other pulsars analyzed so far in terms of vortex unpinning , indicating a particular scale of the glitch trigger",
    ".    the glitch associated change in the external torque contributes a constant offset from the pre - glitch behaviour that remains in the spin - down rate after all post - glitch relaxation is over .",
    "this term , denoted @xmath33 in eq .",
    "( 15 ) , indicates a change in the external torque , which leads to a change in the spin - down rate through @xmath171 .",
    "the actual fractional change in the moment of inertia associated with a possible quake must be less than the observed glitch magnitude , so @xmath172 .",
    "the measured permanent term @xmath33 in @xmath173 therefore gives the fractional change in the external torque .",
    "taking the external torque to be essentially the dipole radiation torque , we have : @xmath174 as the term @xmath175 is again negligible .",
    "we assume that the magnetic field change is associated with crust breaking , involving broken plates of size @xmath176 distributed in a ring of the crust of width @xmath176 and radius @xmath177 from the rotation axis , with each plate moving a distance @xmath176 at the quake",
    ". the field moves with each broken piece of the conducting crust , without any change in the local field magnitude , and orientation , which we take to be normal to the crust plate .",
    "the local field strength varies azimuthally in the broken ring .",
    "we further assume that the broken ring is in the polar regions of the magnetic field , so that the crust breaking has a strong effect on the external torque .",
    "this assumption is plausible if magnetic stresses play a role in crust breaking @xcite . a schematic view of our model for external torque variation via change of magnetic field s perpendicular component is depicted in figure 2 .",
    "the external torque variation is related to the change @xmath178 in the angle between the rotation and magnetic axes : @xmath179 from our estimate of the change in external torque , @xmath180 given in table 2 , we obtain : @xmath181 which is between @xmath182 and @xmath183 . to obtain this ,",
    "we have used the range of @xmath184 considered by @xcite , @xmath185 corresponding to an emission height @xmath186 km and @xmath187 corresponding to an emission height @xmath138 1800 km .",
    "the tiny change @xmath178 in inclination angle can not be resolved as an observable glitch associated pulse shape change in the present radio timing data .",
    "motion of crustal plates towards the pole ( @xmath188 ) results in a reduction in the moment of inertia of the solid , and therefore an increase in the spin - down rate .",
    "this is the signature of a crust quake in a spinning down pulsar , tending to make the shape more spherical .",
    "the reason for the external torque change is likely to be a starquake , inducing motion of crustal plates , and reducing @xmath189 , as the surface magnetic field moves with the conducting plates towards the rotation axis .",
    "the fractional change in moment of inertia due to the motion of the crustal plates is @xmath190 , where @xmath191 is the total mass of the moving plates and @xmath192 is the mass of the entire star . observing the direct effect of this actual change in the crustal moment of inertia as a glitch is impossible .",
    "the glitch magnitude @xmath193 is due to amplification by the vortex motion triggered by crust - breaking and the resulting angular momentum transfer from superfluid to normal matter .",
    "we have assumed that some of the vortices pinned to the moving plates are initially carried inward with the plates .",
    "this is possible when the increase @xmath194 in superfluid rotation rate , due to the inward motion of the pinned vortices on the time scale of crust breaking is not sufficient for the local lag to increase from the steady state value to the critical value , @xmath195 , for typical values of @xmath196 @xcite .",
    "these vortices will bend and are likely to be strongly perturbed by the sudden inward motion and become unpinned .",
    "the unpinned vortices will then move downstream azimuthally with the superfluid flow , causing more vortices to unpin and scatter outward until they reach a new radial position where they join the background vortex flow and creep .",
    "the avalanche of unpinning takes place rapidly on the glitch",
    " rise \" timescale .",
    "some number @xmath197 of vortices associated with the moving plates end up in radial positions inward of their original position while a number @xmath198 of vortices end up in radial positions further out compared to their original position .",
    "the moment of inertia of the superfluid creep regions affected by the inward motion of the plates and net inward vortex motion is of order @xmath199 assuming a uniform density neutron star , and adopting @xmath200 for the range of @xmath201 indicated by @xcite . using the value of @xmath202 from fits ,",
    "we obtain the ring width @xmath203 m , where @xmath204 is the neutron star radius in units of @xmath205 cm .",
    "the number of vortices pinned to each plate is @xmath206 the total number of vortices associated with broken plates with a net inward motion during the glitch , is @xmath207 vortices , as we estimated above from the results of our fits for @xmath208 , a parameter independent from @xmath209 which we used to estimate the plate size @xmath176 .",
    "the number of plates involved should be @xmath210 , in agreement with the number of plates in the broken ring , @xmath211 .",
    "a comparable number of vortices @xmath212 end up moving outward through a superfluid region of comparable moment of inertia , @xmath213 .",
    "we find here an indication that the common scale , @xmath214 , of the number of vortices unpinned in all pulsar glitches may be associated with the number of vortices in the typical plate size @xmath176 involved in a triggering crust quake , multiplied by the number of plates involved , @xmath211 .",
    "these scales rest on the single parameter , the plate size @xmath176 which must be related to the physics of the crustal solid .",
    "this plate size @xmath176 is of the same order of magnitude as the ` mountain ' height @xmath215 m estimated for the crab pulsar @xcite .",
    "note that the critical strain angle @xmath216 at which the crust lattice breaks is @xmath217 where @xmath218 is the radial thickness of the broken crustal plates .",
    "thus , @xmath219 compatible with the results of @xcite for the critical strain angle .",
    "it is interesting to compare the moment of inertia fractions in _ crust _ superfluid regions through which the unpinned vortices moved during the peculiar glitch of psr j1119 - 6127 , given in table 2 , with the corresponding crab @xcite and vela @xcite values , @xmath220 and @xmath221 respectively , as this gives a lower limit on the moment of inertia fraction in the crust , leading to constraints on the neutron star equation of state @xcite . with its characteristic age of @xmath222 years ,",
    "psr j1119 - 6127 is between the crab and vela pulsars in age , but its implied crustal superfluid moment of inertia fraction @xmath223 is comparable to the values inferred for the vela pulsar . the qualitative evolution of glitching behaviour from crab - like to vela - like was proposed to be due to the development of connections in a network of vortex creep regions , so that the moment of inertia involved increases with age @xcite .",
    "psr j1119 - 6127 should already have a sufficiently well connected vortex creep network .",
    "presumably the high magnetic field and associated stresses in the crust of this pulsar lead to high crust breaking activity . while similar moments of inertia in vortex creep regions @xmath224 are inferred , and the long term fractional offsets in the spin - down rate are similar in absolute value , for the crab case no change in electromagnetic signature is observed .",
    "magnetic stresses will play a role comparable to that of rotation induced stresses in conventional starquake models if , roughly , @xmath225 where @xmath226 and @xmath227 denote reference values of @xmath228 and @xmath229 frozen into the crust . using the glitch interval @xmath230 yrs , typical for young pulsars , we find that magnetic stresses can play a role where @xmath231 g in the crust .",
    "the magnetic field can have poloidal and toroidal components whose geometry will determine where in the crust the local stresses reach the critical values for crust breaking @xcite .",
    "the higher multiple components of the magnetic field and the geometry of the stress tensor when both magnetic and rotational effects are included further complicate the situation .",
    "in addition , the changes in electromagnetic signature , as seen only in psr j1119 - 6127 , are likely to occur if the broken plate extends to the surface and leads to reconfiguration of the magnetosphere .",
    "this may explain why the behaviour exhibited by psr j1119 - 6127 is rare . as a rough guideline , such behaviour may be exhibited by young pulsars with high magnetic field in young pulsars with high magnetic field .",
    "we should note the different responses of the crust and the superfluid to a starquake .",
    "after the crust breaks and plates move towards the rotation axis in order to relieve their stresses , those broken pieces of the crust are stuck to new metastable positions , and do not come back to their pre - glitch sites .",
    "thus , crust breaking and crustal motion are irreversible .",
    "starquake induced inward motion of vortices leads to a local excess of vortex lines and thereby to faster rotation of the superfluid .",
    "creep becomes more efficient , evolving back towards steady state with an enhanced vortex current , as described by the vortex creep response employed in our fits . in the end ,",
    "the superfluid relaxes back to the pre - glitch dynamical steady state , and all the parts of crustal superfluid and the rest of the star spin - down at the same rate .",
    "indeed , without structural changes , the response of all internal torques will always relax back to @xmath232 .    the main reason of the switch in emission patterns to intermittent and rrat behaviour lasting for about a hundred days after the event in 2007 is likely to be the effect of the quake on magnetic field lines which are anchored to the crust .",
    "if the magnetospheric field pattern could move rigidly , without distortion , together with the motion of the crustal plate , as a consequence of the shift by @xmath233 , there would be no significant change in the emission pattern .",
    "however , when a crustal plate moves in a quake , the elastic response of the field lines , which twist and reconnect , can amplify a small shift in the crustal position into a complex and drastic change in the emission pattern , helped by rotation which results in twisting of magnetic field lines anchored to the highly conducting crust @xcite .",
    "the distorted magnetospheric geometry will subsequently relax towards a quasi - stable configuration for the new position of the plate .",
    "the changes in the emission pattern are observed for about a hundred days following the glitch , after which the pulsar returns to its pre - glitch pulse shape and emission pattern .",
    "twisting of field lines and their subsequent relaxation will also introduce temporary fluctuations in arrival times .",
    "our timing model fits indeed leave relatively large residuals for about a hundred days in the post - glitch data given in the bottom panel of figure 1 .",
    "although the recently discovered magnetar anti - glich from 1e 2259 + 586 by @xcite has also shown a negative spin jump and changing emission features , the situation is very different from that of psr j1119 - 6127 . in the case of 1e 2259 + 586 , the magnitude of the change in spin - down rate , @xmath234 is too large to be associated with the superfluid regions in the star .",
    "it is likely that only a large change in the external torque is involved , as suggested by the violent change in emission , so that this magnetar ` antiglitch ' must be external / magnetospheric in origin @xcite .",
    "in summary , the peculiar glitch of psr j1119 - 6127 offers an invaluable opportunity for the reexamination and extension of glitch models to account for anomalous glitch signatures and transient emission phenomena initiated by a quake leading to a change in the external torque and triggering the response of the superfluid regions of the neutron star .",
    "our model predicts that the change in the external torque is permanent .",
    "the coincidence of the numbers of vortices involved in the glitch with the numbers inferred in crab and vela pulsar glitches is highly suggestive , supporting the explanation in terms of a crust breaking event with a typical plate size , which may be a common , even universal , trigger for glitches .",
    "if future timing observations rule out a permanent change in the external torque , this coincidence would turn out to be spurious .",
    "the explanation of the post - glitch evolution of @xmath235 in terms of internal torques responding to glitch associated inward and outward vortex motion , and relaxing to @xmath236 is viable when there are no observed changes in the external torque .",
