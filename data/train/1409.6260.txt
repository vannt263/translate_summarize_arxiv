    "more theoretical and experimental work is needed to reveal the physical mechanisms , which are not taken into account in a simple dissipative mean - field theory . in accordance with experimental conditions , we assume that the temperature of the condensate is well below the condensation temperature @xmath136 , thus vortices are only weakly affected by thermal noise .",

    "however , the stochastic thermal fluctuations could significantly increase the probability of the phase slips , when the weak link suppresses the potential barrier for vortices in the ring - shaped condensate .",
    "the influence of the thermal fluctuations on the excitation and dynamics of the vortices in a toroidal trap with a rotating weak link merits a separate study .",
