    "in the weak coupling picture of the pre - thermal evolution of heavy - ion collisions , the post collision debris that end up in the mid - rapidity region undergo several stages that are characterised by widely different physics and degrees of freedom . on the one hand , according to the saturation paradigm @xcite , at very early times @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the typical energy scale right after the collision , the energy is deposited in strong color fields .",
    "these strong fields admit a description in terms of classical yang - mills theory to leading order in t hooft coupling @xmath5 .",
    "indeed , there have been several interesting studies of classical yang - mills fields under longitudinal expansion in the past years @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "once the system has reached a local thermal equilibrium , or at least approximately isotropized @xcite , the matter in the mid - rapidity region ( at sufficiently low @xmath6 ) is described by relativistic fluid dynamics @xcite .",
    "there has been a sizeable and very successful program of numerical simulations of relativistic hydrodynamics .",
    "it is well known that classical yang - mills theory can not reach thermalization due to the rayleigh - jeans catastrophe nor can it isotropize when exposed to rapid longitudinal expansion as noticed by @xcite .",
    "instead classical evolution drives the system further away from equilibrium , making the system less occupied ( i.e. weaker fields ) but more anisotropic , which has also been observed in the simulations of @xcite .",
    "therefore , there is a missing link between the physics of saturated gluon fields and fluid dynamics that needs to be bridged in order to fully carry the predictions of saturation physics to the hydrodynamic regime .",
    "this gap can be filled with the systematically improvable framework of effective kinetic theory ( ekt ) of @xcite .",
    "the ekt faithfully describes to leading order in @xmath7 systems where the typical occupancies of gluons are not nonperturbative @xmath8 and have momentum significantly larger than the in - medium screening scale @xmath9 . at weak coupling",
    ", these conditions are certainly fulfilled in thermal equilibrium and therefore we can describe the system all the way to the equilibrium .",
    "while these conditions are not fulfilled at the very earliest times , both ekt and classical yang - mills give an equally valid leading order description for a wide range of large but perturbative occupancies @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "therefore a possible strategy to simulate the system through all time scales is to start the simulation with a classical yang - mills simulation ( for @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) and subsequently pass the system to ekt at some arbitrary time @xmath13 .",
    "then , once ekt has brought the system sufficiently close to the thermal equilibrium , both hydrodynamics and ekt should give equivalent descriptions and the system can be passed to a hydrodynamical simulation at some arbitrary time @xmath14 .",
    "the proof of principle of such a procedure was shown in a series of papers @xcite in an isotropic setting in the absence of expansion . here , we present first results of numerical simulations of the ekt in a boost invariant 2 + 1d setting and demonstrate the connection with both classical yang - mills simulations and viscous hydrodynamics .",
    "we make a first attempt to model the early stages of heavy - ion collision starting from the over - occupied region all the way to the thermal equilibrium and find that after time @xmath15 the time evolution of energy density is described by viscous hydrodynamics to a better than @xmath16 accuracy for a realistic coupling @xmath17 corresponding to @xmath18 .",
    "the current result is , however , incomplete in two ways .",
    "firstly , there have been significant steps to describe the melting of the strong color - fields in classical statistical field theory @xcite , but currently we do not have a reliable initial state from a 3 + 1d simulation to enter into our ekt simulation .",
    "therefore we initialize our system at @xmath19 with the energy density given by 2 + 1d simulation @xcite and vary the parameters of the initial condition to quantify the ignorance of the very early time dynamics . secondly",
    ", certain non - perturbative chromo - weibel instabilities @xcite arising from anisotropic screening play a parametrically leading order role during the whole non - equilibrium evolution @xcite .",
    "however , numerical simulations of classical fields @xcite have not been able to see them beyond the very early times , suggesting that even if parametrically leading order , their effect is numerically small for values of @xmath20 that are phenomenologically interesting . therefore ,",
    "as a formally correct treatment of anisotropic screening is rather complicated @xcite and not a fully solved problem , we in this first work will treat the screening in an isotropic way .",
    "therefore , our results are correct to leading order in @xmath20 for systems that are close to isotropy ( late times ) and for large anisotropies our results have leading logarithmic accuracy apart from the instabilities .",
    "the ekt of @xcite is defined though the effective boltzmann equation for the color and spin averaged distribution function of gluons , and to leading order in @xmath20 it contains effective @xmath21 scattering and @xmath22 splitting terms .",
    "@xmath23 + \\mathcal{c}_{2\\leftrightarrow 2}[f_\\p ] + \\mathcal{c}_{\\rm exp } [ f_\\p].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we restrict ourselves to azimuthally symmetric distributions but allow anisotropy in the @xmath24-direction so that it is enough to specify @xmath25 with @xmath26 .",

    "the screening is treated by replacing the naive tree - level matrix element by the retarded hard thermal loop ( htl ) resummed expression in the soft kinematic region .",
    "the resummed propagator in the anisotropic case , however , contains a non - integrable singularity , signalling the presence of an instability in the system .",

    "in particular for intermediate couplings @xmath123 the overlap of the different curves indicates correct scaling .",

    "numerically this ratio is not very large even in our simulation with small @xmath127 , where the ratio is @xmath128 ( at @xmath129 ) as can be inferred from figure [ hydro ] .",
