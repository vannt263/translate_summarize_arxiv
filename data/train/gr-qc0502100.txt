    "astronomical observations indicate that many galaxies host a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) in their centre .",
    "the inspirals of stellar - mass compact objects into such smbhs with mass @xmath2@xmath3 constitute one of the most important gravitational wave ( gw ) sources for the planned space - based gw observatory lisa .",
    "preliminary results @xcite indicate that the lisa emri detection rate will most likely be dominated by inspirals of @xmath4  bhs into @xmath5  smbhs",
    ". the emri detection rate could be as many as @xmath6 in 35 years within @xmath7 gpc .",
    "the strain amplitude of gws from emris can be estimated using the newtonian quadrupole approximation to the einstein field equations , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the orbital frequency , @xmath10 is the distance of the source from the earth and @xmath11 is the reduced mass .",
    "this can be compared with the characteristic noise strain of @xmath12 at the floor of the lisa noise curve near 5 mhz @xcite . for a @xmath13   emri system at 1 gpc , the instantaneous signal - to - noise ratio ( snr )",
    "@xmath14 is at best around 0.1 .",
    "detection of gws from emris therefore depends on ( semi- ) coherent accumulation of the signal with time .",
    "the optimal method to detect a known time series signal @xmath15 embedded in stationary gaussian noise @xmath16 is matched filtering . in that technique , we search for the maximum correlation of the fourier components of the data with that of the known waveforms , weighted by the noise variance . the optimal snr , @xmath17 , can be written as @xmath18 [ mf ] where @xmath19 is the fourier amplitude of the signal , @xmath20 is the expected variance of the noise component @xmath21 at frequency bin @xmath22 , characterized by @xmath23 , the strain spectral density of the noise , @xmath24 is the number of fourier frequency bins and @xmath25 is the bin width .",
    "the snr squared is therefore effectively proportional to the product of the number of wave cycles with the instantaneous snr squared . during an integration over the lifetime of lisa ( @xmath26@xmath27 yrs ) , the number of gw cycles observed , @xmath28 ,",
    "so the optimal snr can be as high as @xmath29 at 1 gpc .",
    "emri waveforms are complex and are characterized by many frequency components , which arise from several effects .",
    "first , typical emri orbits are expected to be still moderately eccentric , @xmath30@xmath31 , during the last several years of inspiral when lisa can detect them @xcite@xcite . at such moderate eccentricities",
    ", there can be as many as five harmonics of the orbital frequency contributing significantly ( @xmath32 ) to the observed snr @xcite .",
    "in addition , emri signals exhibit many modulations , caused by periastron precession , spin induced precession of the orbital plane and yearly amplitude and doppler modulation due to the motion of lisa around the sun . finally , the frequency components in an emri signal exhibit significant evolution over a lisa observation . for a 3 year observation of a signal with central frequency @xmath33 mhz",
    ", the signal power can be spread over as many as @xmath34 frequency bins @xcite .",
    "this hinders the detection of the signals using simple fourier spectrum analysis .",
    "the complexity of the emri waveforms makes a fully coherent matched filtering search computationally impossible .",
    "rough estimates would suggest that @xmath35 templates are needed for a fully coherent search @xcite . extrapolating to the time of the lisa mission",
    ", it is reasonable to assume @xmath36 tflops of available computing power for the search , but this allows only @xmath37 templates to be searched in real time .",
    "alternative methods are therefore required to detect emris , such as semi - coherent hierarchical searches @xcite .",
    "we describe an efficient and robust strategy to detect gws from emris by accumulating the signal power in the time - frequency ( t - f ) domain .",
    "the t - f power spectrum is produced by dividing the data into 2 week long segments and carrying out a fast fourier transform ( fft ) on each . in the semi - coherent matched filtering search @xcite ,",
    "the waveform is also divided into sections , of @xmath26 weeks . in that case , this is the longest segment length that computational constraints will allow . in the time - frequency analysis , there are no such computational limits , but we choose a 2-week duration to ensure enough time and frequency resolution to trace the frequency evolution of emris with time . the power spectrum is defined for each segment @xmath38 and frequency bin @xmath22 as , @xmath39 } { \\sigma^2_{n_k } } + \\frac{2 ( n^{i}_k)^{2}}{\\sigma^2_{n_k}}. \\label{power}\\ ] ] we then calculate the power `` density '' , @xmath40 , by computing the average power within a rectangular box centered at each point ( @xmath41 ) , @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 are the lengths of the box in the time and frequency dimension respectively and @xmath45 is the number of data points in the box .",
    "the snr at each point @xmath46 is then @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the mean of @xmath49 calculated in the entire t - f plane and @xmath50 is the expected variance of @xmath49 for pure noise . in practice",
    ", we use the variance of the calculated @xmath49 in the entire t - f plane .",
    "the detection process involves finding the local maximum @xmath51 or tracks of `` excess '' @xmath51 .",
    "if the data consist of only stationary gaussian noise , @xmath52 will follow a @xmath53 distribution , with expected @xmath54 , i.e. , the larger the box , the smoother the noise power density in the t - f plane . for a given box size",
    ", the false alarm probability ( fap ) for finding at least one point with @xmath51 above a certain threshold @xmath55 is @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the cumulative distribution function for the @xmath53 distribution .",
    "we estimate @xmath58 for the number of independent data points searched .    to search for a possible signal , we vary the box lengths @xmath43 and @xmath44 until the maximum ( or a significant ) @xmath51 is found .",
    "the optimal box size should be large enough to contain most of the signal power but small enough to exclude most of the noise contribution .",
    "the overall probability of finding a fap@xmath59 below some threshold fap@xmath60 depends on the number of independent trials of different box sizes .",
    "a monte carlo simulation is in progress to determine the statistics of this method and to compute appropriate thresholds . in the present work ,",
    "the fap of the search is based on a simple case where we increase the box dimensions by factors of two , one side at a time , and the overall fap is estimated as fap@xmath59 multiplied by the number of boxsizes searched . in this paper , significant detections are defined as those such that the overall fap of the search is @xmath61 .    like many other time - frequency signal processing methods , this method examines the statistics of the presence of a lot of high power in a region .",
    "our method is in particular similar to the `` excess power '' method @xcite , as both use the summation of powers within a certain time and frequency interval .",
    "the excess power method was designed to detect bursting waveforms .",
    "our approach applies to the detection of both burst - like and continuous waves since it helps to map out the structure of the excess power density .",
    "this structure can then be detected by finding the local maximum or using pattern - recognition methods .",
    "to test this approach , we tried to detect an emri signal in simulated data .",
    "accurate inspiral waveforms are not yet available , so we made use of approximate numerical waveforms , as described in @xcite .",
    "we considered a `` typical '' emri event  the inspiral of a @xmath62  bh into a @xmath63  smbh , with eccentricity @xmath64 and pericentre @xmath65 at the start of the observation , smbh spin of @xmath66 , orbital inclination angle of @xmath67 ( using the definition of inclination in @xcite ) and placed at distances of @xmath31@xmath68 gpc .",
    "we used data of total duration three years , sampled at a cadence of @xmath69s . with these choices , the total number of data points analyzed was @xmath70 .",
    "the simulated data consist of two independent lisa data streams ( the low frequency ` i ' and ` ii ' responses described in @xcite ) .",
    "the combined matched filtering snr at a distance of @xmath71 gpc is @xmath72 for the whole three years of data , and @xmath73 for the last year .",
    "we used the lisa noise response given in @xcite .",
    "in figures  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] we show the normalized power density @xmath51 in the time - frequency domain calculated with the `` optimal '' box size when the emri was at a distance of @xmath31 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath68 gpc respectively .",
    "we also show the power distribution function and the pure noise theoretical expectation for comparison .    at the distance of @xmath31 and @xmath71 gpc ,",
    "the evolution of the gw central frequency ( and harmonics ) with time is apparent to the eye in the time - frequency plane .",
    "the amplitude increases as the particle inspirals but the signal is also modulated by lisa s motion . at @xmath31 gpc , gws from the last year of inspiral can be detected at snr @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath69 , respectively at each of the three dominating frequency components . at the distance of @xmath75 gpc ,",
    "the frequency evolution is visible over the last year and two frequency components are apparent . at a distance of @xmath68 gpc",
    ", the signal can possibly be detected with an snr of @xmath78 , and an overall fap of @xmath79 when searching through all independent trials .    to assess the efficiency of this method",
    ", we show in figure  [ fig3 ] an approximate receiver operator characteristic ( roc ) curve for this method .",
    "the roc is shown for the sources at @xmath71 gpc , @xmath75 gpc and @xmath68 gpc discussed in the text , and also distances of @xmath80 gpc , @xmath81 gpc , @xmath82 gpc and @xmath83 gpc for comparison .",
    "the roc curves were computed by setting thresholds on @xmath49 for each bin size and performing a preliminary monte carlo of @xmath84 noise realisations .",
    "the false alarm probability was computed as the fraction of pure noise realisations in which a threshold was exceeded for at least one bin size .",
    "the detection rate was the fraction of realisations of signal plus noise in which the maximum snr exceeded the threshold for at least one bin size .",
    "the thresholds were set by fixing the @xmath85 defined by equation ( [ fapmeq ] ) to be equal for all bin sizes , taking @xmath86 .",
    "different choices of thresholds amount to distributing the overall fap of the search between the various bins in different ways . the optimum threshold choice for a single source will be source dependent .",
    "monte carlo simulations are underway in order to optimise the threshold choice in the sense of giving the best performance .",
    "we see that the detection performance is very good up to @xmath80 gpc . at @xmath68 gpc ,",
    "the detection rate is still in excess of @xmath87 for an overall false alarm probability of a few percent .",
    "the source at @xmath83 gpc represents the absolute limit of this particular search , since that is the point at which this search ceases to do any better than a random one .",
    "this should be contrasted with the performance of the semi - coherent matched filtering technique @xcite .",
    "an roc curve is not available for that algorithm , but based on the results of gair et al .",
    ", at an overall false alarm probability of @xmath88 the detection rate for this source at a distance of @xmath68 gpc would likely be close to @xmath89 .",
    "as emphasised before , this improved performance comes at much higher computational cost .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have presented a proof of principle that a simple time - frequency method could be used to detect gws from bright emris .",
    "a typical emri source could possibly be detected with snr @xmath90 at a distance up to @xmath0 gpc using this method .",
    "the method is computationally efficient in the sense that it takes only minutes to finish a search of emris with one computer .",
    "based on current estimates of the astrophysical rates @xcite , tens of emris could be detected each year by this technique .",
    "this method does not provide good parameter determination , but it could be used to detect the brightest sources as the first stage of a hierarchical search .",
    "the method provides some information about the frequency content and inspiral rate of an event which can be used to refine a subsequent matched filtering search . in practice ,",
    "the emri detection problem will be made considerably more complicated by confusion with other sources in the lisa data , in particular confusion from white dwarf binaries .",
    "the time - frequency tracks of these other sources will look different to emris .",
    "however , the tracks will overlap and a simple excess power method might not be able to distinguish multiple overlapping sources from one another .",
    "further , in the current analysis , we have only considered a single ` typical ' emri signal , but the frequency and frequency evolution of other emris will be different , which will change the detection statistics . finally , the approximate quadrupole waveforms used in this analysis lack some of the multipole structure that we expect from true inspirals , which will also change our conclusions .",
    "more detailed discussion of these issues will be provided in a follow - up paper @xcite .",
