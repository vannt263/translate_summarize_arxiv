    "local spectral analysis of the solar wind ( sw ) magnetic fields reveals strong time variations in the power level of the turbulent field fluctuations .",
    "this variability of the power level of the field fluctuations is responsible for the strong non - gaussianity of the observed pdfs of field variations associated with intermittency ( ragot 2013 ) .",
    "the strong non - gaussianity of the observed pdfs of field variations is unlikely to be the only observable consequence of the power - level variability . here , we investigate the magnetic field orientations as functions of the highly varying power level of turbulence in the fast sw , and vice versa , where the power level of turbulence is defined with the field fluctuations normalized to the medium - scale ( @xmath2min ) average background field .",
    "sw magnetic fields @xmath3 are measured along sw flow lines and the time series of these in situ field measurements can be averaged on a timescale @xmath4 to obtain mean `` magnetic field vectors '' @xmath5 . if @xmath6 is the time resolution of the measurements and @xmath7 , ( t , t ) = 1 n+1 _",
    "n =- n/2^n/2 ( t+n t ) .",
    "[ bav ] what is the meaning of these mean `` magnetic field vectors '' @xmath8 ? do they somehow give the direction of a real magnetic field within the sw ?",
    "how do they relate to the direction of `` real '' magnetic field lines ?",
    "the answer depends on how much magnetic field lines diverge from each other , locally , and on how much transport they undergo collectively .",
    "if the directions of neighboring field lines strongly deviate from each other rather than being dominated by one common direction of transport , then it is dubious that the mean `` magnetic field vectors '' @xmath9 can be ascribed any other meaning than that of time averages of in situ magnetic fields along sw flow lines .",
    "however , if the directions of neighboring field lines mostly run `` parallel '' to each other , being dominated by one common direction of transport , then the mean `` magnetic field vectors '' @xmath9 give the mean local common direction of transport , or mean local direction of a field line that passes through one of the measurement points .",
    "in a magnetic turbulence with background field @xmath10 , such as the sw , both the field - line dispersal ( relative field - line divergence ) and global field - line transport ( common transport ) can be assessed theoretically and modeled ( e.g. , ragot 1999 , 2006a , 2006b , 2009 , 2010a , 2010b , 2011 ) .",
    "field - line dispersal and global field - line transport are measured by the variations in field - line separations and by the field - line displacements across the background - field direction , or cross - field displacements , @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "it appears that in slow and fast sw streams , the association between time - averaged field vector direction and mean direction of an actual field line is justified on most timescales because the cross - field displacements @xmath11 far exceed the variations in field - line separations on the background field - aligned length scales @xmath12 cm ( e.g. , ragot 2010b , knowing that @xmath13 on these @xmath14 scales).@xmath15 cm apart may grow tenfold on a @xmath14 scale of @xmath16 cm , or even hundredfold on a @xmath14 scale of @xmath17 cm ( see figures 3 and 5 of ragot 2011 ) , and statistically , by factors of @xmath18 and 20 ( from figures 1 , 2 and 4 of ragot 2011 ) , but the variation of that separation remains only a small fraction of the cross - field displacements undergone by both field lines on these @xmath14 scales , here about 0.9 and 3.6 percent at @xmath19 and @xmath17 cm , respectively , in the flux - tube simulation of ragot ( 2011 ) , and only 0.4 and 0.7 percent , statistically ( from figure  1 of ragot 2006b , @xmath20 and @xmath21 cm at @xmath19 and @xmath17 cm , respectively ) .",
    "] for a sw speed @xmath22 , the length scales @xmath14 relate to the timescales @xmath4 through @xmath23 , the angle @xmath24 between parker spiral and radial direction being defined below in equation ( [ spiral ] ) .",
    "the time - averaged field directions obtained by integrating in situ fast sw magnetic fields over time intervals of duration @xmath25s ( depending on @xmath22 ) should therefore match the local field - line directions on the background field - aligned length scale @xmath26 cm . and",
    "the angles @xmath1 [ see equation ( [ tan_a ] ) in section 4 ] between these time - averaged in situ fields and the background field @xmath10 should match the angles between the mean directions of local individual field - line segments of @xmath10-projection @xmath14 and @xmath10 , whose tangents are given by the ratios @xmath27 .",
    "again , this would not be the case if the field lines were too strongly diverging from each other .",
    "these premises are at the basis of the modeling of section 4 for the pdfs of the angles @xmath1 at the scale @xmath28 cm .    a first - order approximation for the large - scale geometry of the sw magnetic fields is given by the parker - spiral model for interplanetary magnetic fields ( parker 1958 , 1963 ) .",
    "the angle @xmath24 of the parker spiral to the radial direction at heliocentric distance @xmath29 is related to the solar rotation rate @xmath30 and sw speed @xmath22 through ( e.g. , burlaga 1995 ) _ r .",
    "[ spiral ] the local magnetic fields actually deviate from the parker spiral by large angles , but the parker spiral direction generally represents a good axis of symmetry for long statistics of the fields .",
    "pdfs of the azimuthal angles of the magnetic fields in - ecliptic projections were determined from in situ measurements early on ( ness & wilcox 1966 ; hirshberg 1969 ; see also , burlaga & ness 1997 ) .",
    "more recently , pdfs of the angles between sw magnetic fields and parker spiral ( or background field ) were also determined both in three- and two - dimensional space from in situ measurements , and using the measured fourier spectra of magnetic fluctuations , also theoretically and numerically ( ragot 2006b ) .",
    "these determinations , however , were made from only one single sw stream in each of four sw conditions ( slow and fast sw at @xmath31 and @xmath32au ) , and the time variability of the power level of turbulence was not considered .",
    "here we focus on the fast sw near @xmath33au and extend our analysis to a large set of streams ( over one hundred ) observed onboard _ ace _ and _ stereo a _ and _",
    "b_. most importantly , we analyze the directions of the local magnetic fields as functions of the local level of turbulence , rather than a characteristic average value of that level .",
    "an earlier study by podesta ( 2009 ) showed that the turbulent energy observed in fast sw streams is on the average higher when the local magnetic field is normal to the sw flow .",
    "the conclusion of that earlier study was that the higher levels of turbulent energy seen when the local magnetic field is normal to the sw flow are indicative of anisotropic turbulence with a wavevector distribution dominated by the wavevectors normal to the field .",
    "we are somewhat skeptical of this conclusion that variations of turbulent energy with magnetic field angles necessarily reflect an anisotropy of the wavevector distribution .",
    "our skepticism is driven by the facts that ( 1 ) the variations in the turbulent energy and turbulence level are actually so much greater than the variations seen in the above anisotropy argument ( orders of magnitude , to be compared to a factor of the order of a few ) , and ( 2 ) the orientation of the local magnetic field is in large measure determined by the turbulent energy and turbulence level ( see abstract , next paragraph and section 3 for a definition of the power level of turbulence or turbulence level ) , as we confirm here through our analysis and modeling of the field orientations for a broad range of turbulence levels .    through our analysis and modeling",
    ", we will test whether a turbulence model of isotropic wavevector distribution could account for the observed pdfs of local field angles at any of the measured turbulence levels .",
    "we will also test whether the pdfs of angles relative to the radial can be recovered from the pdfs of angles relative to the background under an assumption of axisymmetry and parker - spiral background field . here , we distinguish between turbulent energy and turbulence level .",
    "the turbulent energy is basically the power level of the magnetic field fluctuations , computed at either one frequency or integrated over a broader frequency range .",
    "by contrast , to anticipate our discussion of section 3.5 , the turbulence level is the power level of the magnetic field fluctuations _ normalized to the medium - scale average background field . _ while the turbulent energy does say little about the stochasticity of the fields and the amount of field - line wandering actually taking place in the sw , especially if the background field undergoes strong fluctuations , the turbulence level tightly parametrizes field stochasticity and field - line wandering . in fast sw streams",
    ", it appears that the background field does undergo strong fluctuations .",
    "therefore , the turbulence level as defined above and in greater detail in section 3.5 , is a far better ordering parameter for the orientations of the fast sw magnetic fields . whether the turbulence level is defined at one frequency , integrated over a range of frequencies , or",
    "involves a more complex combination of frequencies through the formula for the mean cross - field displacement ( see sections 3.4 and 3.5 ) does not affect that basic fact .    our data selection is presented in section 2 and the variations in the power level of magnetic fluctuations are shown in section 3 , where the power level of intermittent turbulence is also defined . in section 4 , through modeling of the pdfs of field - line directions , we model the pdfs of the angles @xmath1 between local and background ( or parker spiral ) fields at series of stable levels of turbulence .",
    "section 5 deals with the transition from the @xmath1 angles to the angles @xmath0 between local fields and radial direction .",
    "section 6 presents some consequences of the power variability on the field orientations and the apparent `` anisotropy '' of the turbulence .",
    "the conclusion follows in  section  7 .",
    "the study presented in this paper requires high statistics of fast sw turbulent magnetic fields . to reach sufficient statistics , we use data from _ ace _ , from year 2000 to 2011 , and from the two _ stereo _ spacecraft , _ stereo ahead _ ( or _ a _ ) and _ stereo behind _ ( or _ b _ ) , from year 2007 to 2012 .",

    "stream leading and trailing edges were avoided as far as possible .",
    "some of the selected intervals obviously belong to the same sw stream , but for our purpose , they can be considered as independent because of the broad separation of the spacecraft and/or the time lapsed between recurrences .",

    "we know from these earlier studies that the displacements @xmath11 across the direction of the background field @xmath10 on a given field - aligned scale @xmath14 , which should give good estimates of the directions of the in situ magnetic fields averaged on the corresponding timescale @xmath92 , is not dependent on the fourier power level at just one frequency , but at a broad range of frequencies [ see section 3.4 and equation ( [ dr ] ) ] . because the spectral power level is so wildly varying with time and frequency ( see figures 13 ) , studying the field directions as functions of the spectral power level at any one single frequency may therefore not reveal the most meaningful trends of the data . by instead studying the field directions as functions of a linear combination of the fourier power levels @xmath88 at a broad range of frequencies ( or wavenumbers )",
    "that happen to produce the variance @xmath102 of the field - line displacements [ see equations ( [ dr ] ) and ( [ dr_bz ] ) ] , we believe that we are optimizing our chances of uncovering the underlying organization of the field directions , and of modeling these field directions successfully .",
    "the use of the mean cross - field displacement , @xmath89 , which is a linear combination of the spectral amplitudes @xmath88 , rather than that of just one of the spectral amplitudes @xmath88 , presents the advantage of incorporating the variability effects at all frequencies . also , unlike the spectral amplitudes @xmath88 , which may vary by up to a couple of orders of magnitude with time but actually tell us little about the turbulent behavior of the fields , the mean cross - field displacement has an obvious simple physical meaning that is directly related to the turbulent behavior of the fields .",
    "it is the quantity that we will be using here to quantify the turbulence level .",
    "more precisely , we introduce the parameter @xmath116 defined by c^1/2 , [ c ] with the mean cross - field displacement @xmath112 given by equations ( [ dr_bz ] ) and ( [ dr ] ) .",

    "we find that an averaging scale of @xmath2min is a good compromise between the two .",
    "the pdfs of @xmath120 and @xmath121 differ relatively little from each other , meaning that a @xmath2min average already captures most background field fluctuations . also , a scale of @xmath2min in fast sw of speed exceeding @xmath122 km s@xmath35 is a safe 40 to 50 times longer than the scale @xmath28 cm . in the rest of this paper ,",

    "the occurrence rate of @xmath127 is relatively low ( see red curve in figure 4 ) .",

    "the angles of the model are the angles @xmath130 between segments of magnetic field lines with projection @xmath14 on the background field , and the background field , while the measured angles are the angles @xmath1 between the time - averaged in situ fields and the background field @xmath10 or parker spiral .",

    "the contribution from the highest turbulence levels are much reduced in figure 6 in the `` stable '' subset because the peaks of higher power are usually of short duration or involve very steep time variations .",
    "figure 7 shows similar pdfs for a stricter definition of stability whereby the edges of the stability intervals are removed ( some @xmath137s on each end ) .",
    "this eliminates time intervals over which the computed turbulence power level may still be influenced by time intervals with different dominant power level .",
    "the contribution of each subinterval is now more peaked around its center , but the pdf shape is not otherwise significantly modified .",
    "the purpose of these subsets of stable turbulence power levels is to check whether the angles between local and background fields can be accurately modeled and understood when the basic model requirement of stable turbulence levels is satisfied . for more generally varying turbulence power levels ,",
    "the modeling would require a more complex convolution to include the contributions from all power levels .",
    "this is beyond the scope of the current paper . here , we just want to find out whether the model has a chance to work in the first place and check the basics .",
    "we thus deconvolve the problem by decomposing the data into distinct turbulence power levels , instead of convolving the model .    on the @xmath14 scales less than @xmath138 cm",

    "the reason for this distinction is that at the lowest values of @xmath46 , typically below 28 , `` compressive '' field - aligned fluctuations become dominant . to the `` non - compressive '' transverse model based on equation ( [ dr ] )",

    "the results for the pdfs of @xmath1 are the blue lines shown in the bottom panels of figure 8 .",
    "the model ( black lines in upper panels and dark - blue lines in bottom panels ) fits the measured pdfs well for the subset of stable turbulence levels , confirming the validity of the model .",
    "as expected , however , the model does not fit the measured pdfs so accurately ( see red and light - blue pdfs ) when intervals of fast varying turbulence level are included in the data .",
    "we now decompose the @xmath1 pdfs into four ranges of turbulence levels ( @xmath149 in violet , @xmath150 in green , @xmath151 in blue and @xmath152 in red ) . in figure 9",
    ", we compare the pdfs of each subrange for the subset of stable turbulence levels and for the entire data set , both for a @xmath45-field averaged on @xmath103 cm ( top panel ) and on @xmath2min [ bottom panel , where the sum in the denominator of equation ( [ tan_a ] ) is made from -450 to 450 instead of -n/2 to n/2 ] in the definition of @xmath153 .",
    "the measured @xmath1 pdfs differ little at the lower turbulence levels , but more significantly at the higher levels .    with the same decomposition into four ranges of turbulence levels , we compare in figure 10 the measured normalized @xmath1 pdfs of the stable subset with the model pdfs .",

    "figures 8 , 10 and 11 reveal no problem with our modeling of the magnetic fields and of their orientations relative to the background field , as long as the turbulence level varies sufficiently slowly . on all subsets of stable turbulence level",
    ", we obtain fits of the measured pdfs that are actually quite good , even at the highest turbulence levels where the theory was not originally intended .",

    "finally , we compute the pdfs of these new angles and show them in dotted lines in figure 12 .",
    "the modeled pdfs of @xmath0 appear to fit the measured pdfs reasonably well as soon as @xmath166 . at the highest turbulence levels , above @xmath167",
    ", we note that the @xmath0 pdfs , both measured and modeled , are nearly flat on a broad range of angles @xmath0 between @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "this we now believe can be attributed to the broad and nearly axisymmetric distribution of the turbulent fields about the background - field direction .    in the cases @xmath170 and @xmath171 , where the modeled pdfs are less than satisfactory , we do an additional transformation with a slightly different background field direction , shifted by some 7 and 8   relative to the parker spiral .",

    "they appear to improve the fit to the measured pdfs of @xmath0 , but the fit at the lowest turbulence level remains less than satisfactory .",
    "the issue there again might be connected to the measured `` compressibility '' of the turbulence .",
    "we also note that the statistics in the central power bin ( @xmath172 ) are relatively high , and that a large number of sw streams contribute to these statistics , with a spread in the parker spiral direction of more than 4 degrees around the mean value of @xmath173 .",
    "it may be affecting our result , but reduced statistics with more constrained values of @xmath22 and therefore @xmath24 did not seem to change that result .",
    "this issue will need further investigation .    from the simple test of this section ,",
    "we conclude that axisymmetry of the turbulent fields around a background field in or near the direction of the parker spiral is a reasonably good assumption that produces fairly accurate fits of the measured pdfs of @xmath0 angles , away from the lowest turbulence levels where @xmath45 turbulence becomes dominant , that is , above @xmath174 .",
    "this `` axisymmetry '' result appears to us difficult to reconcile with an @xmath0 anisotropy of turbulence power driven by a wavevector anisotropy .",
    "figure 13 displays the pdfs of `` turbulence levels '' @xmath46 for series of angles @xmath1 ( left panels ) and @xmath0 ( right panels ) measured between 0 and 90  ( top panels ) and between 0 and 180   ( bottom panels ) .",
    "the left panels show pdfs peaking at the highest levels of turbulence near the normal to the background field ( green pdf ) , and at the lowest levels near the direction of the background field ( black , yellow ) , with a clear shifting of the peak with the angles @xmath1 and @xmath175 .",
    "magnetic fields near the normal to the background dominate at the highest levels of turbulence , while magnetic fields close to the background field direction dominate at the lowest turbulence levels @xmath46 , which can also be seen in figure 12 ( see also dashed - line histograms for entire data set of figure 9 ) . as a consequence , because the angle between background and radial direction is relatively small in fast sw ( @xmath176 ) , it is also true that magnetic fields at large angles to the radial are preponderant at higher @xmath46 , while magnetic fields closer to the radial are more frequent at lower @xmath46 .",
    "but the effect is less striking in the right panels of figure 13 than that for the angles @xmath1 relative to the background in the left panels .",
    "the strong `` anisotropy '' shown in figures 12 and 13 , and further in figure 17 , of course is related to our choice of the parameter @xmath46 to characterize the turbulence level [ see equations ( [ c][xi ] ) ] .",
    "this parameter closely orders the peaks of the @xmath1 and @xmath175 pdfs because it is related to the mean cross - field displacement of the turbulent field lines .",
    "but we argue that the power level has to be divided by the squared magnitude of the background magnetic field , as it is done in the definition of @xmath116 and therefore @xmath46 , because in itself , the power in @xmath177 tells us nothing about turbulence ; it is the power in @xmath178 ( of the fluctuations relative to the background ) that does .",
    "no matter how high the power in @xmath177 , if @xmath113 is high enough , it will `` quench '' the turbulence .",
    "figures 14 and 15 are the `` equivalent '' of figures 12 and 13 with a turbulence level defined using the field fluctuations @xmath179 at only one frequency ( close to @xmath180 ) , rather than using the mean cross - field displacement @xmath181 as in section 3.5 .",
    "similar conclusions can be drawn from these figures .",
    "so our conclusion that the highest turbulence levels are found near the normal to the parker spiral and the lowest levels near the parker spiral direction is _ not _ due to the use of @xmath182 in place of @xmath179 in the definition of the turbulence level .",
    "figure 16 also shows the pdfs of the angles @xmath1 for a series of intervals of the parameter @xmath183 .",
    "the pdfs of figure 16 are to be compared to the dashed - line histograms of the top panel of figure 9 for the entire data set .",
    "again , the results are similar whether the definition of the turbulence level involves @xmath182 or only @xmath179 .",
    "we note , however , that the parameter @xmath184",
    "@xmath185 used throughout this paper is a more meaningful ordering parameter because the turbulent magnetic field lines are affected by the turbulent field fluctuations at a broad range of frequencies , down to where the spectrum becomes flatter than @xmath78 , and not just by the fluctuations at the frequency inverse of the averaging timescale for the computation of the mean local field direction .",
    "the parameter @xmath46 , in all instances where the transverse fluctuations dominate , that is , above about @xmath186 , gives the approximate location of the peak in the pdfs of the angles @xmath1 between mean local and background parker fields . and @xmath116 would simply be proportional to any one of the amplitudes @xmath88 , that is , to what is ordinarily understood as the energy level of turbulence in self - similar , non - intermittent turbulence .",
    "it is only because the sw turbulence is strongly intermittent that involving the mean cross - field displacement @xmath89 in the definition of the turbulence level presents an advantage . ]    knowing the bivariate pdfs @xmath187 for @xmath188 , @xmath175 , @xmath0 and @xmath189 , we can now estimate the average turbulence level at each angle @xmath190 by computing the integral (  ) _ 0^ _ d p ( ,  ) ^2 , [ cav ] with a cutoff at @xmath191 .",
    "the results relative to @xmath192 in the first bin of the @xmath190 histograms , are presented in figure 17 for @xmath193 .",
    "the peaks heights are very sensitive to the value of the cutoff @xmath194 .",
    "for instance , a value @xmath195 would produce a peak in @xmath196 over 4 times higher than found here in figure 17 , and if all turbulence levels present in our data set were included , that peak would exceed 500 .",
    "the value @xmath193 was chosen because it is already sufficiently large to produce high peaks , yet still low enough to keep the rising phase of the curves at low @xmath190 clear .",
    "most importantly , we note that the ratio @xmath197 is much greater for @xmath1 and @xmath175 than it is for @xmath0 and @xmath189 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath1 of the turbulence level is the main effect , that of the turbulence level on @xmath0 a mere consequence of it .",
    "the steeper dependence on @xmath1 , or stronger `` anisotropy '' in @xmath1 , is due to the fact that the @xmath1 pdfs remain peaked at all turbulence levels  @xmath46 , whereas the @xmath0 pdfs become flat at the higher @xmath46 ( see figure 12 ) as a result of the broad and presumably nearly axisymmetric distribution of field directions about the background field direction .",
    "also , the use of the amplitudes @xmath198 rather than @xmath116 as defined in equation ( [ c ] ) would lead to much steeper curves and higher peaks , depending on the frequency ( see figure 18 ) .",
    "the higher the frequency , the higher the peaks , consistent with the findings of podesta ( 2009 ) . finally , when the running @xmath2min average @xmath113 of the background field magnitude is replaced by the long - time average @xmath110 in the definition of @xmath46 , the sharp dependence of the average turbulence level @xmath199 on the angles @xmath1 and @xmath0 is damped out .",
    "it is reduced in figure 19 to a mere factor @xmath200 increase in @xmath0 , and is almost entirely suppressed in @xmath1 .",
    "the result of figure 19 for the dependence on @xmath0 is very much consistent with the results shown in the top panel of figure 7 in podesta ( 2009 ) .",
    "the strong `` anisotropy '' presented in this section is in no way related to any anisotropy in the wavevector distribution of the turbulence .",
    "the fact that the turbulence levels are observed to be much higher in the directions close to the normal to the parker spiral than in the directions close to the parker spiral itself is strictly due to the facts that ( 1 ) the field directions deviate more strongly from the parker spiral direction when the turbulence is higher , and ( 2 ) the turbulence level varies strongly with time , enabling the observation of a wide range of field directions and turbulence levels .",
    "so the strong apparent `` anisotropy '' presented in this section is strictly a consequence of the turbulence - level time variability .",
    "in an effort to identify the effects of the broad variations in turbulence levels on the orientations of the local mean fields , we have analyzed the turbulent magnetic fields of a large set of fast sw streams measured onboard _ ace _ and _ stereo a _ and _ b_. our multiscale fourier analysis of the transverse turbulent fields reveals time variations of the spectral power at all frequencies and on many timescales .",
    "the higher the time resolution of the spectral analysis is , the stronger the fluctuations of the power level are .",
    "the higher - resolution fluctuations far exceed the lower - resolution fluctuations , but roughly follow them in their time average ( see figures 1@xmath383 ) . from this multiscale fourier analysis",
    ", we estimate as a linear combination of the fourier amplitudes @xmath88 ( see figure 3 ) the gql mean cross - field displacement of the magnetic field lines in the time - varying intermittent turbulence .",
    "this estimate of the mean cross - field displacement in intermittent turbulence is given by the square root of equation ( [ dr ] ) with a local medium - scale ( @xmath201min ) average background field @xmath113 substituting for the stream average @xmath110 .",
    "it includes the effects of all turbulent scales and fluctuates on many timescales .",
    "this estimate of the mean cross - field displacement , once divided by the field - aligned scale @xmath14 , defines the square root @xmath117 of the power level of the intermittent turbulence in equation ( [ c ] ) , and the related angle , @xmath202 , used throughout the paper to parametrize the power level of the intermittent turbulence .",
    "provided `` compressibility effects '' are included at the lowest power levels of turbulence ( @xmath203 ) , modeling the pdfs of the angles @xmath1 between local and background fields produces satisfactory fits of the observed pdfs at all stable power levels of turbulence ( see figures 8 , 10 and 11 ) , that is , on all time intervals with variations in the power level of turbulence that are sufficiently slow . because the highest power levels of turbulence happen in short bursts , the statistics for stable power levels are biased toward the lower turbulence levels and smaller angles ( see figures 6@xmath389 ) .",
    "but the fits remain quite accurate at all levels @xmath46 , even for the very low statistics of the higher @xmath46 .",
    "because our gql modeling does not assume anything about the three - dimensional distribution of wavevectors in the turbulence , and therefore does not preclude an isotropic distribution of wavevectors , it follows from these fits that an isotropic turbulence could account for the measured pdfs of the angles @xmath1 between local and background fields at all stable levels of turbulence .",
    "both the direct measure of the field projection on the background field ( parker spiral direction ) and the pdfs of the measured angles @xmath1 between local and background fields reveal local field reversals that are quite common even within very broad streams of `` unipolar '' fast sw ( see figures 5 and 12 ) . on the whole , they happen some 4 to 10 percent of the time , but at the highest levels of turbulence , short - scale reversals are so frequent that on the scale of @xmath103 cm , reversed fields are practically as common as normal - polarity fields .    modeling through monte - carlo simulation the pdfs of the angles @xmath0 between local fields and radial direction from the measured pdfs of the angles @xmath1 , we find that axisymmetry of the turbulent fields around a background field in or near the direction of the parker spiral is a reasonably good assumption .",
    "the modeling made under this simple assumption does indeed produce fairly accurate fits of the measured pdfs of @xmath0 angles , away from the lowest turbulence levels where @xmath45 fluctuations become dominant , that is , above @xmath174 . at the highest turbulence levels , above @xmath204 , both the model and observed @xmath0 pdfs are nearly flat on a broad range of angles @xmath0 between @xmath168 and @xmath169 ( see figure  12 ) .",
    "unsurprisingly , magnetic fields near the normal to the background field or parker spiral dominate at the highest turbulence levels , while magnetic fields close to the parker spiral direction dominate at the lowest turbulence levels @xmath46 , with a peak of the @xmath1 ( @xmath46 ) angle pdfs smoothly shifting from the parallel to the normal direction ( from the low to the high turbulence levels ) as @xmath46 ( @xmath1 ) increases [ figure 12 ( 13 ) ] .",
    "this results in a very steep dependence of the average power level of turbulence @xmath205 of equation ( [ cav ] ) on the angle to the parker spiral , and in a more moderate dependence on the angle to the radial ( figure  17 ) .",
    "the steeper dependence on @xmath1 is due to the fact that the @xmath1 pdfs remain peaked at all @xmath46 whereas the @xmath0 pdfs , due to the broad and nearly axisymmetric pdfs of the field directions relative to the background , become flat at the higher @xmath46 . the dependence is found to be even steeper for the higher - frequency amplitudes @xmath206 ( figure 18 ) , but strongly reduced for @xmath199 ( figure 19 ) .",
    "our conclusion that magnetic fields near the normal to the background parker spiral dominate at the highest turbulence levels , while magnetic fields close to the parker spiral direction dominate at the lowest turbulence levels is not modified by the use of a single - frequency turbulence - level definition @xmath207 in the place of @xmath208 ( figures  1416 ) .",
    "we do not presume to know whether the @xmath0 `` anisotropy '' of @xmath199 presented in figure 19 is a residual effect of the strong variability in the power level of turbulence .",
    "but we can certainly conclude that the extreme `` anisotropy '' seen in figures 17 and 18 is unambiguously caused by the time variability in that power level of turbulence , and not by any anisotropy in the wavevector distribution of the turbulence . clearly , a purely isotropic model of turbulence , that is , a model of turbulence with an isotropic distribution of wavevectors @xmath80 , _ can _ reproduce the pdfs of the angles @xmath1 and @xmath0 between local and background fields and between local field and radial direction presented in this paper for series of the power level of turbulence . by this",
    "we mean that an isotropic model of turbulence can not be excluded on the basis of the observed dependences of the angle pdfs on the power level of turbulence , or of the average power levels of turbulence on the angles .",
    "these dependences are entirely imputable to the time variability in the power level of turbulence observed in the fast sw streams .",
    "these results are consistent with the near isotropy found by narita et al .",
    "( 2010 ) from four - point magnetic field measurements of the cluster spacecraft at the turbulence scales close to @xmath103 cm in the sw .",
    "the parameter @xmath46 defined by equations ( [ c ] ) and ( [ xi ] ) does order the directions of the local fields best because it physically represents the local _ statistical _ average directions .",
    "this tight ordering of the local field directions with the parameter @xmath46 brings the observed `` anisotropies '' of the average power level of turbulence to extremes much higher than otherwise found with the power level _ undivided _ by the local background field . but",
    "again , we argue that the power level has to be divided by the squared magnitude of the background magnetic field because in itself , the power in @xmath177 tells us nothing about turbulence , it is the power in @xmath178 that does .",
    "no matter how high the power in @xmath177 , if @xmath113 is high enough , it will `` quench '' the turbulence .",
    "the variations of @xmath113 itself are likely caused , in large part , by the non - uniformity of the emerging fields within each of the coronal holes at the source of the fast sw streams .",
    "we suggest that some of the variations of @xmath113 , in particular the local field reversals ( figure 5 ; section 3.6 ) , may also be signs of intermixed magnetic fields of opposite polarity , originating from a different sw stream , perhaps even signs of ongoing reconnection with these opposite - polarity fields , or remnants of reconnections that took place earlier . though it is of course also possible and even likely that some of these local field reversals are due to the reconnection , at the basis of the corona , within coronal holes , of open field lines with closed magnetic loops .",
