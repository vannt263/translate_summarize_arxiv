    "one of the not yet solved puzzles of cuprate high - temperature superconductors ( htsc ) is a nature of underdoped normal state - the pseudogap regime@xcite .",
    "perhaps most powerful experimental tool to access electronic properties of the pseudogap state is angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes)@xcite .",
    "common understanding is the fluctuating origin of the pseudogap state , however type of the fluctuations is still under discussion .",
    "whether these are superconducting fluctuations@xcite or some order parameter fluctuations ( afm(sdw ) , cdw , stripes , etc.)@xcite coexisting or competing with cooper pairing is up to now undecided .",
    "there are several prototype compounds among high - t@xmath0 systems e.g. hole doped bi@xmath7sr@xmath7cacu@xmath7o@xmath8 ( bi2212 ) system or the electron doped one  nd@xmath9ce@xmath10cuo@xmath3 ( ncco ) . now",
    "a lot of experimental arpes data on bi2212 and ncco is available ( see the review  ref .  ) .",
    "for instance fermi surface ( fs ) maps , quasiparticle band dispersions and even self - energy lineshapes mapped onto some models are obtained from modern arpes measurements  @xcite . into this list of prototype componds",
    "should be of course included the first ever high - t@xmath0 hole doped system la@xmath9sr@xmath11cuo@xmath3 ( lsco ) which was also investigated both in theory and experiment with great details.@xcite    within the normal underdoped phase ( pseudogap regime ) a number of interesting physical phenomena were discovered .",
    "for example , fs is partially `` destructed '' in the vicinity of the so - called `` hot - spots '' ( points of crossing between fs and afm umklapp surface ) .",
    "`` shadow bands '' ( partial folding of band dispersion ) appear apparently as a result of short range afm order .",
    "formation of the so called fermi `` arcs '' around brillouin zone ( bz ) diagonal reminiscent of the parts of noninteracting fs is experimentally detected in numerous arpes experiments@xcite . despite apparently the same physics behind",
    ", pseudogap regime demonstrates some material specific features . for bi2212 fermi `` arcs '' go almost up to bz border where they are strongly blurred .",
    "the ncco also has fermi `` arcs '' but fs `` destruction '' looks different .",
    "the  hot - spots  are well observed in ncco while towards the bz border fs is almost restored as a non interacting one.@xcite    the present paper is devoted to pseudogap behavior in the underdoped lsco and its comparison with bi2212 and ncco .    according to common knowledge high - t@xmath0 systems",
    "are usually doped mott insulators , effectively described by the hubbard model .",
    "most common method to solve the hubbard model in our days is dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft)@xcite .",
    "its exactness in the infinite spatial dimensions limit makes dmft a local approach . since high - t@xmath0 compounds as it is well established have quasi two - dimensional nature spatial fluctuations play important role for their physics . to overcome this difficulty we introduced dmft+@xmath12 computational scheme@xcite which supplies conventional dmft with `` external '' @xmath5-dependent self - energy .",
    "main assumption of the dmft+@xmath12 is additive form of the self - energy which allows one to keep conventional dmft self - consistent set of equations .",
    "the dmft+@xmath12 approach was used to address the pseudogap problem@xcite , electron - phonon coupling in strongly correlated systems@xcite and disorder induced metal - insulator transition within the hubbard - anderson model@xcite . for the pseudogap state",
    "this self - energy @xmath12 describes the interaction of correlated electrons with non - local ( quasi ) static short - ranged collective heisenberg - like antiferromagnetic ( afm or sdw - like ) spin fluctuations@xcite .",
    "dmft+@xmath12 approximation was also shown to be appropriate to describe two - particle properties e.g. optical conductivity.@xcite    as a possible way of theoretical simulation of the pseudogap regime for real materials we proposed lda+dmft+@xmath4 hybrid method@xcite .",
    "it combines first principle one - electron density functional theory calculations within local density approximation ( dft / lda ) @xcite with dmft+@xmath4.@xcite    lda+dmft+@xmath4 method allowed us to obtain fermi arcs and `` hot - spots '' behavior for both electron doped e.g. nd@xmath13ce@xmath14cuo@xmath3@xcite ( ncco ) and pr@xmath13ce@xmath14cuo@xmath3 ( pcco)@xcite as well as hole doped bi@xmath7sr@xmath7cacu@xmath7o@xmath8 ( bi2212)@xcite high - t@xmath0 cuprates .",
    "pseudogap behavior of dynamic optical conductivity within lda+dmft+@xmath4@xcite was also discussed for b12212@xcite and ncco@xcite .    this communication reports lda+dmft+@xmath4 computations of fermi surface and spectral functions for hole underdoped la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 ( lsco ) system supported by high energy , high resolution bulk sensitive arpes@xcite .",
    "the la@xmath7cuo@xmath3 system has base - centered orthorhombic crystal structure with space group @xmath15 with two formula units per cell@xcite .",
    "corresponding lattice parameters are a=5.3346 , a=5.4148 and c=13.1172  .",
    "atomic positions are the following : la(0.0,-0.0083,0.3616 ) , cu(0,0,0 ) , o(1/4,1/4,-0.0084 ) , o2(0.0,0.0404,0.1837 ) .    as a first step of lda+dmft+@xmath4 method we performed density functional theory calculations in the local density approximation ( lda ) for these crystallographic data .",
    "band structure was obtained within the linearized muffin - tin orbitals ( lmto ) method@xcite .",
    "it is well known for these compounds that fermi level is crossed by antibonding o2@xmath16-cu3@xmath17 partially filled orbital of @xmath18 symmetry .",
    "tight - binding parameters for this band were calculated by -th order lmto ( nmto ) method@xcite as ( in ev units ) @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "these values agree well with previous studies.@xcite coulomb interaction value on effective cu-3@xmath17(@xmath18 ) orbital was calculated by constrained lda approach@xcite and was found to be @xmath23=1.1  ev .",
    "these lda obtained parameters are used to set up corresponding one - band hubbard model .",
    "the second step is further treatment of the above defined hubbard model within the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) self - consistent set of equations@xcite supplied by `` external '' momentum - dependent self - energy @xmath4@xcite .",
    "using the additive form of self - energy ( main approximation of the scheme neglecting the interference between hubbard interaction and pseudogap fluctuations , which allows one to preserve conventional dmft equations ) one can define lda+dmft+@xmath4 green function as : @xmath24 where bare electron dispersion @xmath25 is defined by lda calculated hopping parameters listed above . to calculate @xmath4 we used a two - dimensional pseudogap model@xcite describing nonlocal correlations induced by ( quasi ) static short - range collective heisenberg - like afm spin fluctuations .",
    "thus we introduce correlation length dependence of the pseudogap fluctuations into conventional dmft loop .",
    "there are two points which make dmft+@xmath4 different from the usual dmft .",
    "first , momentum dependent @xmath4 is recalculated on each dmft iteration ( @xmath26)$ ] is in fact the function of dmft chemical potential and dmft self - energy ) .",
    "second , dmft+@xmath4 lattice problem is defined at each dmft iteration as : @xmath27 after numerical self - consistency is reached we get the green s function ( [ gk ] ) with corresponding @xmath28 and @xmath29 taken on the last dmft iteration .",
    "all further computational details can be found e.g. in refs .  .",
    "as an `` impurity solver '' for dmft equations numerical renormalization group ( nrg@xcite ) was employed .",
    "temperature of dmft(nrg ) computations was taken to be 0.011  ev and electron concentration used was n=0.86 .",
    "self - energy @xmath30 due to pseudogap fluctuations depends , in general , on two parameters : the pseudogap amplitude @xmath31 , and the correlation length @xmath32.@xcite the value of @xmath31 was calculated as in ref .",

    "the high - energy arpes measurements were carried out at bl25su in spring- 8 , using incident photons of 500 ev , on single crystal samples . the normal to the cleaved sample surface was set almost parallel to the axis of the lens of the analyzer and the sample was set to about 45@xmath38 from the incident light direction .",
    "the photoelectrons within polar angles of about @xmath39 around the normal to the sample were simultaneously collected using a gammadatascienta ses200 analyzer , thereby covering more than a whole brillouin zone along the directions of the analyzer slit .",
    "the fermi surface mapping was performed by changing the angle along the perpendicular direction to the analyzer slit .",
    "the base pressure was about 4 x 10@xmath40pa .",
    "the ( 001 ) clean surface was obtained by cleaving the samples in situ in vacuum at the measuring temperature of 20 k. the overall energy resolution was set to 100 and 170 mev for high - resolution measurements and fermi surface mapping , respectively .",
    "the angular resolution was @xmath410.1 ( @xmath410.15 ) for the perpendicular ( parallel ) direction to the analyzer slit .",

    "longer photoelectron mean free path of @xmath4412  at the kinetic energy of @xmath44500 ev than that for conventional arpes at @xmath4520 - 60 ev , the bulk contribution to the spectral weight is estimated as about 60% .",

    "[ contour_plot ] ]    in case of finite temperature and interaction strength we have to take into account the finite life time effects of quasiparticles .",
    "thus instead of just a dispersions @xmath25 one should rather work with the spectral function @xmath47 given by @xmath48 with retarded green s function @xmath49 obtained via lda+dmft+@xmath4 scheme@xcite .",

    "around ( @xmath6,0 ) point one can clearly see splitting of the spectra by afm pseudogap fluctuations of the order of 2@xmath31 .",
    "also afm nature of the pseudogap fluctuations leads to formation of the `` shadow '' band which is much weaker in intensity and becoming the real quasiparticle band in case of complete folding in case of long - range afm order .",

    "it is alike that obtained for bi2212@xcite .",
    "namely the `` hot spots '' are not well resolved since the crossing point of the bare fermi surface and afm umklapp surface are very close to brillouin zone border .",
