    "although it is well known that free bosons hopping on translationally invariant networks can not undergo bose - einstein condensation at finite temperature if the space dimension @xmath2 is less or equal to two ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , very recent studies @xcite hint to the exciting possibility that the network topology may act as a catalyst for inducing a finite temperature spatial bose - einstein condensation even if @xmath3 . as an example of this situation we shall investigate the properties of non - interacting bosons hopping on a star shaped optical network , evidencing that - already for this very simple graph topology - one may have a macroscopic occupation of the ground - state at low temperatures .    a star graph ( see fig . [ fig1 ] )",
    "is made of @xmath4 one - dimensional chains ( _ arms _ ) which merge in one point called the center of the star .",
    "each site @xmath5 of the star arms is naturally labeled by two integer indices @xmath6 and @xmath7 where @xmath8 labels the distance from the center and @xmath9 labels the arms .",
    "the center of the network is denoted by @xmath10 .",
    "the total number of sites is @xmath11 ; each site on the arm is linked only to two neighbors whereas the center has @xmath4 neighbors : thus the fact that the center has coordination number @xmath4 is the source of spatial inhomogeneity in this lattice . in the following",
    "we shall evidence that bosons hopping on this graph undergo - at a certain temperature @xmath0 , which depends on the number of star arms - a topology induced spatial bose - einstein condensation in a state localized around the center of the star graph .",
    "bosons hopping on star - shaped networks can be experimentally realized loading a dilute bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in a suitable periodic potential , arranged to provide a star - like configuration .",
    "periodic potentials are , nowadays , routinely created with two or more counterpropagating laser beams ; one can accurately tune the height of the potential ( which is proportional to the power of the lasers ) as well as the distance between neighboring sites .",
    "when one loads an atomic bec in a deep optical lattice , one has a bosonic josephson network , i.e. , an array of bosonic josephson junctions ( bjj s ) .",
    "a single bjj may be obtained by loading a bec in a double well potential : the weak link between the atomic condensates is provided by the energy barrier between them and the dynamics of the atoms at @xmath12 is described by josephson equations , obtained from the gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite .",
    "similarly , with a multi - well periodic potential , when the heights of the barriers are much higher than the chemical potential , the system realizes a lattice of weakly coupled condensates .",
    "each bosonic josephson junction consists of a pair of neighboring condensates : the tunneling rate ( proportional to the josephson energy ) is easily tuned by changing the power of the lasers , and it decreases if the interwell barriers increase .",
    "the properties of a bosonic josephson network at @xmath12 are described by a discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation , obtained from the gross - pitaevskii equation with a periodic potential @xcite .",
    "we remark that recently it has been showed that a @xmath13 optical network of bec can be described by the gross - pitaevskii equation also at finite temperature , provided that the interwell energy barriers and the frequency of the axial confinement are large enough @xcite .",
    "present - day bjj networks are built on regular geometries : linear chains @xcite , squares @xcite and cubes @xcite . however , a variety of non - conventional structures may be produced by the standing waves of several interfering laser beams suitably placed @xcite .",
    "for instance , a star with four arms may be realized by having two perpendicular gaussian laser beams superimposed to a @xmath13 optical lattice ; the center of the star should be then arranged by adjusting the distance between neighboring wells .",
    "bjj networks may be pertinently described by the bose - hubbard hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "in fact , when all the relevant physical parameters are small compared to the excitation energies , the field operator @xcite , describing the condensate configuration in the bjj network , may be expanded as @xmath14 with @xmath15 the normalized wannier wavefunction localized in the @xmath16-th well and @xmath17 the bosonic number operator . substituting the expansion for @xmath18 in the full quantum hamiltonian describing the bosonic system @xcite leads to a bose - hubbard model @xmath19 in eq .",

    "since , for atomic condensates , @xmath30 may be varied by tuning the scattering length using feshbach resonances @xcite , one may assume that @xmath31 ; for the sake of simplicity , in the following we shall set @xmath32 .",
    "the filling , i.e. , the average number of particles per site , is defined as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the total number of bosons . when @xmath35 and the fluctuations of the particle numbers per site are much smaller than @xmath36 , one can safely substitute the operator @xmath37 with @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the number of particles at the site @xmath5 @xcite . as a result",
    ", the josephson energy of a single bjj is given by @xmath40    it is worthwhile to remark that the bose - hubbard hamiltonian ( [ b - h ] ) describes not only bec s , but in general cold bosons in a deep periodic potential , provided that the temperature does not excite higher bands : @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the band energy gap and @xmath43 is the interwell energy barrier . in this paper",
    "we are considering a bec in a deep optical lattice : thus we are also assuming that in each well one has a grain condensate , i.e. , that one works at a temperature smaller than the temperature @xmath44 at which condensation occurs in a single well . for @xmath45 ,",

    "the experimental situation in which the total number of particles is so small that @xmath44 is much lower than @xmath0 should be also possible : in this case for @xmath52 one has not an array of bjj s , but at @xmath0 the bosons can still macroscopically occupy the ground - state described by the eigenfunction ( [ ground_state_star ] ) .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in sec .",
    "ii we analyze the spectrum of bosons hopping on a star - shaped graph ; we shall evidence that , due to the network inhomogeneity , an isolated localized ground - state appears in the spectrum ( its effect is similar to the one induced by an impurity on a linear chain , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; we shall also determine , as a function of the number of star arms @xmath4 , the energy gap between the ground - state and the continuum states as well as the coherence length @xmath53 which characterizes the topology induced spatial condensation of bosons in the center of the star graph . in sec .",
    "iii we analyze the thermodynamic properties of non - interacting bosons hopping on the star graph and we determine the critical temperature @xmath0 as a function of @xmath4 and of the josephson energy of the single bjj ; we show that the condensate fraction and the inhomogeneous spatial distribution of bosons over the array can be expressed in a simple way as a function of the scaled temperature @xmath1 .",

    "<S> new coherent states may be induced by pertinently engineering the topology of a network . as an example , we consider the properties of non - interacting bosons on a star network , which may be realized with a dilute atomic gas in a star - shaped deep optical lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state is localized around the star center and it is macroscopically occupied below the bose - einstein condensation temperature @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that @xmath0 depends only on the number of the star arms and on the josephson energy of the bosonic josephson junctions and that the non - condensate fraction is simply given by the reduced temperature @xmath1 . </S>"
