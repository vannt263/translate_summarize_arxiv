    "quantum information processing and quantum control often require precise information about the parameters in the system hamiltonian , the surrounding environment , the coupling and measurement strengths , and so on .",
    "however , due to inevitable randomness during quantum measurement , and several quantities of interest even can not correspond to proper quantum observables , the quantum parameter estimation @xcite has become a fundamental problem in quantum science and technology . rigorously speaking ,",
    "this problem arises most especially in gravitational - wave experiments , and the maximum sensitivity for a conventional continuous monitoring of the probe mass s position is given by the standard quantum limit ( sql ) for the mass s sensitivity to the classical force @xcite .",
    "however , caves @xcite showed that with the help of squeezed state technique , quantum mechanical systems can achieve greater sensitivity over the sql . from then on ,",
    "scientists and engineers have developed various quantum technologies @xcite to improve the accuracy of a wide variety of quantum measurements .",
    "theoretically the ultimate precision limit is the heisenberg limit ( hl ) , which relies on the unitarity of the time evolution .",
    "when a quantum state is used as a probe and an optimization procedure is involved , the quantum version of the cramr - rao inequality @xcite can be established . in general , the cramr - rao bound can be applied to any parameter estimation problem and the quantum fisher information ( qfi ) @xcite is the upper bound on the precision of parameter estimation .    be different with the closed quantum system , quantum probes would unavoidably interact with the surrounding environment , which decays the quantum coherence of the probes . in this realistic situation , the dissipative cramr - rao bound has been derived , and the estimation accuracy remarkably depends on the underlying dynamical map with the semigroup property @xcite . due to the profoundness of the theory of open quantum systems @xcite , enhancing a quantum estimation task in the presence of noise involves the fundamental interest @xcite . in particular , much attention has been devoted to the estimation of the noisy frequency and loss parameters @xcite . for example , in recent work @xcite it has been shown that the estimation accuracy of loss rate can be improved by the kerr - type nonlinear hamiltonian . in this paper ,",
    "nonlinearity once again reveals its positive role @xcite as a resource in the quantum metrology . on the other hand , due to the dissipative evolution of the quantum system ,",
    "the coherence of the initial state would be quickly damaged and the gaussian input becomes a set of non - gaussian states .",
    "thus , how to globally optimize these two conflicting objectives ( 1 . maximizing the fisher information that improves the parameter estimation precision ; 2 . minimizing the backaction on the system that maintains the fidelity ) is of great importance in practically employing the quantum parameter estimation method .    in our work ,",
    "we study the quantum parameter estimation based on the linear and kerr - type nonlinear controls in the hamiltonian of the system . in particular , the estimation of dissipation rate of a quantum master equation has been considered . with the pure state approximation",
    ", we obtain the qfi in analytical form .",
    "we verify the validity of this approximation by comparing the approximate qfi with the exact one with various controls ( linear and kerr - type nonlinear ) .",
    "we show that when we enhance the parameter estimation precision , it usually induces significant backaction on the system itself . in this paper",
    ", we propose a multi - objective model @xcite which can optimize the two conflicting objectives ( qfi and fidelity ) together .",
    "finally , simulations of a simplified @xmath0-constrained model demonstrate the feasibility of the hamiltonian control in the quantum parameter estimation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , based on a simple quantum master equation , we detailed analysis its solutions with pure state approximation . in sec .",
    "iii , we calculate the quantum fisher information with various control hamiltonians . in sec .",
    "iv , we study the trade - off between the qfi and the quantum fidelity by the multi - objective optimization theory .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in sec .  v.",
    "in reality , the quantum systems are inevitably interacted with the environment , and the evolution of the system is described by a master equation @xcite . the simplest master equation describing an amplitude dissipation is @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the dissipation rate of a bosonic channel , and @xmath3 is the annihilation operator . here",
    ", we assume that @xmath4 is an unknown parameter which required to be estimated .",
