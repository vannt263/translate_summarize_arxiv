    "knots are also present in biological molecules : for example , some proteins exhibit knotted configurations @xcite , and the active modification of dna knots through energy - consuming enzymes ( topoisomerases ) poses interesting challenges to the issue of the knot detection @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the observation of individual molecules by single molecule force spectroscopy has come of age @xcite ; these methods can be used to probe the mechanical behaviour of knotted biopolymers directly .    given a knot in a closed ring ,",
    "an obvious question is whether , on average , the knot segregates into a small region in which all topological details are confined , and a large , simply connected segment ; or whether it is loosely spread over the entire chain . in the dilute phase",
    ", it has been found by numerical evidence that flattened ( hence two - dimensional @xcite ) knots are localised , i.e. _ tight _ @xcite . in a previous study @xcite",
    ", we developed an analytical approach , based on scaling results for polymer networks @xcite , which explains and quantifies the tightness of any prime knot in flat ( 2d ) dilute polymer loops .",
    "some aspects of our results have been verified experimentally by means of a vibrated granular chain @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned that dna chains have experimentally been flattened by adsorption on an adhesive membrane @xcite . in 3d ,",
    "the global topological constraints of a knot are hard to implement by analytical methods @xcite .",
    "( a simpler topological invariant , the linking number of closed dna rings , can be incorporated in the mapping to a field theory @xcite by means of suitable gauge fields @xcite . )",
    "consequently , the tightness or localisation of 3d knots has not been conclusively characterised .",
    "a number of phenomenological models and numerical studies support the localisation of simple knots @xcite .",
    "tightness has also been found in 3d slip - linked polymer chains in the dilute phase @xcite .",
    "conversely , delocalisation has been predicted for more complicated knots @xcite .    in many situations ,",
    "however , polymer chains are not dilute .",
    "polymer melts , gels , or rubbers exhibit fairly high densities of chains , and the behaviour of an individual chain in such systems is significantly different compared to the dilute phase @xcite .",
    "similar considerations apply to biomolecules : in bacteria , the gyration radius of the almost freely floating ring dna is often larger than the cell radius itself .",
    "moreover , under certain conditions , there is a non - negligible osmotic pressure due to vicinal layers of protein molecules , which tends to confine the dna @xcite . in protein folding studies , globular proteins in their native state",
    "are often modelled as compact polymers on a lattice ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .    given this motivation , in this work",
    "we consider self - avoiding _ dense _ polymers with permanent entanglements , complementing our previous studies for the dilute phase @xcite .",
    "a polymer is considered dense if , on a lattice , the fraction @xmath1 of occupied sites has a finite value @xmath2 .",
    "this can be realised by a single polymer of total length @xmath3 inside a box of volume @xmath4 and taking the limit @xmath5 , @xmath6 in such a way that @xmath7 stays finite @xcite . alternatively",
    ", dense polymers can be obtained in an infinite volume through the action of an attractive force between monomers .",
    "then , for temperatures @xmath8 below the transition ( theta ) temperature @xmath0 , the polymers collapse to a dense phase , with a density @xmath2 , which is a function of @xmath8 @xcite . for a dense polymer in @xmath9 dimensions ,",
    "the exponent @xmath10 , defined by the radius of gyration @xmath11 , is simply @xmath12 . in 2d",
    ", the dense polymer phase for @xmath13 is related to a conformal field theory , and the resulting scaling behaviour is known exactly @xcite .",
    "the limit @xmath14 is realised in hamiltonian paths , where a random walk visits every site of a given lattice exactly once . for some cases ,",
    "their scaling behaviour is known exactly as well @xcite .",
    "another way to make polymers collapse in 2d is to exert a pressure on self - avoiding loops ( 2d vesicles ) , conjugate to their area , which results in double - walled , branched structures @xcite .",
    "recently , the corresponding crossover scaling function from linear to branched polymers ( lattice animals ) has been obtained exactly @xcite .",
    "it is believed that the branched and dense polymer phases are different .    here , we extend our previous scaling analysis of knots in dilute polymers @xcite to the dense phase , and at the @xmath0 point .",
    "the general conclusion is that the entropic mechanism for tightening of entanglements is considerably weaker in the denser regimes .",
    "while the simple figure - eight structure is still tight in these phases , the trefoil becomes loose , with the trends more pronounced in the dense phase .",
    "note that at the @xmath0 point in 2d , the swelling exponent is @xmath15 , implying a fractal dimension @xmath16 smaller than @xmath17 , and an asymptotic density of @xmath18 .",
    "in a recent numerical study , orlandini , stella , and vanderzande @xcite ( hereafter referred to as osv ) investigate the tightness of the 2d projection of the trefoil knot , and find _ delocalisation _ , in contrast to the strong localisation obtained in the dilute case @xcite .",
    "the main focus of this work is thus the localisation of flat entangled polymers in the dense phase and at the @xmath0 point by means of scaling arguments , in analogy to the dilute case @xcite . when possible , we compare these results with our own numerical simulations , as well as those by osv . in section [ sec_loc ]",
    "we first review the differentiation between tight ( localised ) and loose ( delocalised ) segments in entangled polymers . in section [ sec_f8 ]",
    "we then consider the 2d figure - eight structure ( f8 ) and compare our scaling results with monte carlo simulations . in section [ sec_trefoil ]",
    "we derive the scaling results for the 2d projection of the trefoil , and compare them with the simulations by osv .",
    "section [ sec_con ] contains our conclusions . in appendix [ sec_app ]",
    "we compile some scaling results for general polymer networks .",
    "finally , at the end of appendix [ sec_app ] , we consider briefly a newly discovered phase of 2d dense polymers where the strict non - crossing condition is relaxed @xcite .",
    "consider an entangled polymer chain in 2d of length @xmath3 , such as a simple flat , once - twisted ring with one crossing ( called `` figure - eight '' ( f8 ) , see position iii in figure [ fig31 ] top row ) or the 2d projection of the trefoil pressed flat against a surface by an external force ( figure [ fig31 ] ) @xcite .",
    "the orientations of the crossings are irrelevant , and can thus be considered as vertices with 4 outgoing legs .",
    "thus , each structure is mapped on a 2d polymer network with a number of vertices which are joined by @xmath19 segments of variable lengths @xmath20 under the constraint @xmath21 . in the following",
    "we shall use the convention @xmath22 .",
    "since we are interested in the tightness of such a network , we define the size of the entangled region as @xmath23 so that the remaining ( largest ) segment is @xmath24 .",
    "clearly , for the f8 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , while for the trefoil @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "note that the above definition does not necessarily imply that @xmath29 is small ; however , if @xmath30 , the structure assumes the form of a possibly multiply connected knot region of size @xmath29 and a large simple loop of size @xmath31 . for a knot represented by the network @xmath32",
    ", an important quantity is its number of configurations @xmath33 for fixed @xmath29 . in general , in the tight limit @xmath30 , the configuration number scales as a power law @xmath34 where the exponent @xmath35 depends on the topology of the network @xmath32 . for ease of notation . ]    for given @xmath36 , various quantities of interest can be calculated .",
    "for example , the mean size of the knot region is given by in principle ; the choice of @xmath37 imposes no restriction on generality . ] @xmath38 with the ( normalised ) probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath39 we have introduced a short - distance cutoff @xmath40 , set by the lattice constant , to control the non - integrable singularity at @xmath41 which occurs in equation ( [ small ] ) for @xmath42 , and in the denominator of equation ( [ pdf ] ) for @xmath43 .",
    "( 10,10.5 ) ( -6.2,-8.8 )    thus , depending on the value of @xmath44 , three cases can be distinguished :    \\(i ) @xmath45 : both integrals are well - defined for @xmath46 , and one immediately obtains @xmath47 due to dimensional considerations .",
    "the knot region grows linearly with @xmath3 and is thus _ delocalised _ ,",

    "\\(iii ) @xmath52 : to leading order in @xmath40 , one finds @xmath53 , i.e. , the size of the knot region is independent of @xmath3 for @xmath5 , and is thus _ strongly localised_.    in a more complicated network , such as for the trefoil in figure [ fig31 ]",
    ", several segments can be simultaneously tight .",
    "we shall refer to the emerging structures as possible _ shapes _ ( or contractions ) of the original network .",
    "each shape corresponds again to a network @xmath32 .",
    "the parameter @xmath44 not only determines the tightness of the knot region for given shape @xmath32 , but also controls the _ overall likelihood _",
    "@xmath54 , of different possible shapes .",
    "the latter is obtained ( up to normalisation ) by integrating @xmath55 over all possible values of @xmath29 , as in the denominator of equation  ( [ pdf ] ) .",
    "depending on the values of @xmath44 , different cases can be distinguished :    \\(i ) @xmath45 : the integral is convergent for small @xmath29 with a finite limit for @xmath56 , and scales as @xmath57 . if there is a variety of shapes with @xmath58 , the one with the lowest value @xmath59 is the most likely , @xmath54 for the others scaling with a factor of @xmath60 .",
    "this is expected , since networks with @xmath45 are delocalised over the whole chain of length @xmath3 .",
    "\\(ii ) @xmath43 : the integral is divergent for small @xmath29 , and is thus dominated by the lower cutoff . to make sure that the knot region is large enough to consider different vertices ( crossings ) as separated on a scale much larger than @xmath61 , one should use a lower cutoff @xmath62 of intermediate length @xmath63 .",
    "gives worse statistics since configurations with @xmath64 become less frequent .",
    "in our case , we considered two vertices as separated if the segment between them was larger than 5 monomers . for the original trefoil this gives @xmath65 monomer lengths ( 5 monomers @xmath66 5 segments ) . ] the relative probabilities for different shapes with @xmath43 now scale with a factor of @xmath67 .",
    "different shapes with @xmath68 scale differently with the lower cutoff @xmath62 , but not differently with @xmath3 .",
    "this reflects the fact that for @xmath68 the probability @xmath54 is dominated by the small @xmath29 behaviour of @xmath55 .    in both cases",
    "@xmath54 scales with a factor of @xmath69 .",
    "this is the _ scaling order _ of such a shape @xmath32 , as the likelihood of possible shapes with distinct values of @xmath44 can be ordered according to powers of @xmath70 with more dominant networks for smaller values of @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "the most elementary entangled object in 2d is the f8 , which consists of two loops of variable lengths @xmath29 and @xmath31 ( position iii in figure [ fig31 ] top row ) .",
    "the crossing point can be considered as a vertex with 4 outgoing legs , and the f8 corresponds to a network with @xmath25 segments of lengths @xmath71 and @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "the number of configurations @xmath73 for the f8 can be deduced from results for general polymer networks , obtained by duplantier and coworkers @xcite , which are compiled in appendix [ sec_app ] . in 2d",
    "it has the scaling form @xmath74 as discussed in the previous section , the localisation of f8 is controlled by the limit of @xmath75 for @xmath76 , i.e. , the behaviour of the scaling function @xmath77 for @xmath78 .",
    "the latter can be determined by the following argument ( see text below equation ( 59 ) in reference @xcite ) : clearly , for @xmath30 , the big loop of length @xmath79 will behave like a simple ring , so that @xmath73 should reduce to @xmath80 .",
    "this implies @xmath81 as @xmath82 and thus @xmath83 the value of the exponent @xmath44 for the 2d dense f8 ( see appendix [ sec_app ] ) is @xmath84 implying that the smaller loop is _",
    "weakly localised_. this means that the probability for the size of each loop is peaked at @xmath41 and , by symmetry , at @xmath85 .",
    "an analogous reasoning for the 2d f8 at the @xmath0 point gives @xmath86 i.e. , in this case the smaller loop is also weakly localised .",

    "figure [ fig-8_1 ] shows the development of this symmetry breaking as a function of the number of mc steps .",
    "we note , however , that the fluctuations of the loop sizes in the `` stationary '' regime appear to be larger in comparison to the dilute case studied in reference @xcite .",
    "we checked that for densities ( area coverage ) above 40% the scaling behaviour becomes independent of the density .",

    "the slip - link is locked , i.e. , the chain can not slide through it , and the two loops are of equal length during the entire preparation . finally , when the envisaged density is reached , the hard walls are replaced by periodic boundary conditions , and the slip - link is unlocked . for all densities",
    "studied we observe that one of the loops becomes much smaller than the other one .",
    "we consider the chain as relaxed when the structure has changed from symmetric ( @xmath89 ) to asymmetric ( @xmath90 , @xmath91 ) , then to symmetric and back again to asymmetric .",
    "after this we start to sample the probability distribution for the loop lengths . the probability distribution with chain length @xmath92 and density @xmath93 required about @xmath94 monte carlo steps ( @xmath95 attempted moves ) .",

    "this yields the desired number of configurations of the 2d trefoil with fixed @xmath30 as @xmath102 with @xmath103 , where @xmath104 from equation ( [ nexp ] ) in appendix [ sec_app ] ( @xmath105 , @xmath106 ) and @xmath107 is the number of independent integrations over chain segments .",

    "we find that the leading shape is again the original ( uncontracted ) trefoil , with @xmath115 .",
    "this implies that the 2d trefoil is _ delocalised _ also at the @xmath0 point .",
    "all other shapes are at least weakly localised , and subdominant to the leading scaling order represented by the original trefoil .",
