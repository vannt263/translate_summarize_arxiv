    "these outflows may drive significant fractions of the gas from galaxies with shallow potential wells .",

    "our observations were obtained with an average slit angle 112  east of north ; the approximate aperture placement is shown superposed on _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) wfpc2 v - band and ( continuum subtracted ) h@xmath18   images in figure  [ figcap1 ] .",

    "data from both orbital day and night were used in spectral regions not affected by airglow lines ; otherwise , only data obtained during orbital night were used in our analysis of the ngc625 absorption features .",
    "this observation produced 23 raw time - tagged exposures which were re - processed using a recent version of the _ fuse _  calibration software ( calfuse v2.4 ) available from johns hopkins university .",
    "this pipeline reduction removes mirror , grating , and spacecraft motions , and then corrects for astigmatism and doppler motions .",
    "wavelengths are assigned to each photon , and these events are screened for data quality ( e.g. , event bursts , spacecraft jitter , etc . ) .",
    "the data are then flux calibrated and the bad pixel maps are corrected for spacecraft motions . finally , spectral extractions are performed for each detector segment for each channel using either the orbital night - only data or the orbital day and night data .",
    "each individual exposure was processed by the pipeline and the resulting spectra were combined to produce the final spectrum for each channel and data segment .",

    "the two sic channels are optimized for shorter wavelengths ( 905 to 1100  ) , while the lif channels are optimized for longer wavelengths ( 980 to 1187  ) .",
    "the lif channels are more sensitive than the sic channels , so these provide our highest signal - to - noise ( s / n ) data .",
    "the effective area of the telescope is also maximized at @xmath2 1032   ( i.e. , very near the important  absorption features ) , so we concentrate our analysis on the lif1 channel , with lif2 ( lower s / n ) serving to verify detections .",
    "data in the sic channels are generally of low s / n ( caused by a combination of lower effective area and channel misalignment between the lif and sic channels ) , and we do not use them in this analysis .",
    "we present in figure  [ figcap2 ] the lif1a and lif1b spectra of ngc625 , binned to 0.05   resolution for clarity .",
    "note the richness of the spectrum , with numerous strong absorption lines detected .",
    "we do not combine any of the overlapping detector segments , due to the changing spectral resolution and sensitivity of the detectors as a function of wavelength .",

    "this is in general agreement with , though slightly lower than , the h  i  systemic velocity derived by @xcite , v@xmath23 @xmath9 413@xmath05 kms@xmath3 .",
    "we note that our _ fuse _  slit placement covers h  i  gas in emission at velocities from @xmath2 405 - 415 kms@xmath3 . since velocity offsets of up to 20 kms@xmath3  are common in _ fuse _",
    "spectra , we interpret the velocity centroid of the molecular gas to be coincident with the h  i  and stellar populations .",

    "@xmath9 401@xmath010 kms@xmath3 .",
    "these values are equal within the errors ; the small offset between the two may be caused by the neutral gas being split into two kinematic components ( separated by 10 - 20 kms@xmath3 ) . to test for this , we compared fits for single and double gaussian components to the strongest line profiles ( including @xmath11039.230  , @xmath11020.699  , and @xmath11063.176  ) , but found no statistically significant difference ( in @xmath25 per degree of freedom ) between them .",
    "the weakness of the putative second component introduces a negligible contribution to the error budgets for derived column densities and abundances ( see below ) .",
    "there are two ionized gas absorption lines detected in clean regions of our spectra , including the @xmath11037.018   line of @xmath26 and the @xmath11012.495   line of s  iii .",
    "these absorptions give an average ionized gas velocity of v@xmath27 = 377@xmath09 kms@xmath3 ; i.e. , offset with respect to the molecular gas by @xmath1324 kms@xmath3 .",
    "finally , coronal gas is detected in  @xmath11031.926   absorption at a velocity of 370 kms@xmath3 .",
    "this is blueshifted from the molecular gas velocity by @xmath1331 kms@xmath3 , from the neutral gas by @xmath1322 kms@xmath3 , and from the ionized gas by @xmath137 kms@xmath3   ( though equal within errors ) .",
    "the weaker line of the doublet at @xmath11037.617   falls in a complicated spectral region and is not used in the present analysis ; see figure  [ figcap3 ] for a closer view of the spectral region around .",
    "we present in figures  [ figcap4 ] and [ figcap5 ] the normalized line profiles of the detected absorption lines from the ism of ngc625 ( absorption features were normalized by using clean spectral regions surrounding the lines ; our error budget incorporates errors as a result of the continuum placements , which are usually comparable to the statistical noise ) .",
    "this scenario is consistent with a low - velocity outflow , where the coronal gas has the largest velocity offset from the starburst region ( which presumably is coincident with the velocity of the molecular and neutral gas absorption features ) .",
    "however , it is important to note that although the velocity centroids of the different types of gas may differ , there is considerable overlap in the velocity extents of many of the profiles ( examine figures  [ figcap4 ] and [ figcap5 ] ) .",
    "we interpret these changing velocity centroids and line breadths as results of the outflow , but it is clear that gas of all ionization levels co - exists throughout the galaxy .",
    "this velocity gradient is discussed further in   [ s4.1 ] .      for each unblended spectral line shown in table  [ t2 ] ,",
    "the absorption profiles were converted into apparent optical depths , and then these profiles were integrated over velocity ( see further discussion in savage & sembach 1991 ) .",
    "the essence of this technique is to measure the depth of normalized absorption lines as a function of velocity , and then to use atomic physics to infer the column density that best reproduces such a line profile .",
    "the column density and normalized line depth are related by :    @xmath28    where n is the column density in atoms@xmath16 , m@xmath29 is the mass of the electron , c is the speed of light , e@xmath30 is the standard unit of charge , _ f _ is the oscillator strength of the transition , @xmath1 is the rest wavelength of the transition , and @xmath31 is the apparent optical depth as a function of velocity ( the natural logarithm of the ratio of intensity in the continuum versus intensity in the line , as a function of velocity ) .",
    "this method is preferred over other common practices ( e.g. , curve of growth analysis ) because it does not presume a functional form for the line under analysis . in general , the results from standard curve of growth techniques and the apparent optical depth method agree very well , and we adopt the apparent optical depth method values in this work . note that the kinematic characteristics were derived separately using gaussian fitting ( see above ) .    for the diffuse molecular hydrogen absorption detected ,",
    "we derive weighted mean column densities of log(n(h@xmath4 ) ) @xmath9 14.92@xmath00.19 ( j@xmath90 ) , 14.91@xmath00.09 ( j@xmath91 ) , and 14.47@xmath00.13 ( j@xmath92 ) . following @xcite",
    ", we can infer a range of rotational temperatures , t@xmath32 , of @xmath2 70 - 90 k. at high densities where collisions dominate the level populations , this value is indicative of the kinetic temperature of the gas .",
    "such a progression is expected for relatively low - excitation h@xmath4 , with the bulk of the diffuse gas in the lowest available rotational levels , and the column densities rapidly decreasing toward higher rotational levels .",
    "derivation of the h  i  absorbing column is discussed in ",
    "[ s3.3 ] ; combining this estimate with the measured molecular columns implies a diffuse molecular fraction _",
    "f_@xmath33 2@xmath610@xmath34 .",
    "it should be noted that this value samples the most uv - bright sightlines , and hence is heavily weighted toward material on the line of sight to the major starburst region .",
    "this is not coincident with the highest h  i  column density seen in emission ( which is offset with respect to the starburst region ; see cannon etal .",
    "2004 ) nor with a large detected molecular cloud ( from co observations ; see c^ ot ' e , braine , & cannon , in preparation ) .",
    "in general this highlights a shortcoming of the lyman and werner bands in probing cool molecular gas , as these lines are sensitive to diffuse gas ( i.e. , sightlines with low extinctions ) but are less sensitive to the more common discrete molecular clouds and star formation complexes where the bulk of the cool molecular material is expected to reside ( since these regions will be more heavily extincted and hence have less background uv continuum emission ) .",
    "this point is discussed in more detail in   [ s4.2 ] .    for other neutral and ionized gas absorption lines present in our spectra ,",
    "we derive the following column densities : log(n ) @xmath9 14.63 ( n  i ) , 15.80 ( o  i ) , 15.37 ( si  ii ) , 13.54 ( p  ii ) , 15.04 ( s  iii ) , 13.98 ( ar  i ) , and 14.73 ( fe  ii ) ; typical errors are 0.1 - 0.2 dex ( see table  [ t2 ] ) .",
    "we note that the o  i   @xmath11039.230   line may be saturated ; since the sic channels are of low s / n we can not probe the amount of saturation empirically with other o lines in these data alone .",
    "we discuss tests for saturation and their implications in   [ s3.3 ] .",
    "for the purposes of this paper , we adopt the empirical o  i   column ( 15.80@xmath00.12 ) as a lower limit ; we note that this implies an upper limit for our implied neutral gas [ n / o ] ratio ( see next section ) . for the coronal gas",
    "as traced by  @xmath11031.926   absorption , we find log(n ) @xmath9 14.32@xmath00.08 .",
    "we use the neutral species to derive gas - phase abundances in the next subsection ; the coronal gas is discussed in more detail in   [ s4.1 ] .",
    "an estimate of the h  i  column density in ngc625 from these data alone is hindered by the low s / n of the spectra in the sic channels ; this precludes us from using the higher - order lyman lines , and we are left with only ly@xmath35 to constrain the h  i  column . however , the velocity separation of ngc625 and the milky way and the low measured galactic column along this high - latitude sightline ( @xmath1373.1 ; we find a galactic column log(n(h  i ) ) @xmath9 20.3@xmath00.2 ) are sufficient to clearly separate galactic and intrinsic absorption profiles .",
    "this allows us to analyze both the red and blue wings of the ngc625 h  i  absorption feature , better constraining our fit to the h  i   column density .",
    "we present in figure  [ figcap6 ] a closer view of the region surrounding ly@xmath35 , overlaid with fits to both the galactic and intrinsic h  i  columns .",
    "a pronounced uncertainty remains in our measured h  i  column due to the presence of strong stellar  p - cygni profiles in the spectrum redward of ly@xmath35 ( see figure  [ figcap6 ] ) .",
    "these features result in an uncertainty in the adopted continuum in the region around ly@xmath35 .",
    "we adopt the mean of a `` low '' and `` high '' continuum placement , as shown in figure  [ figcap6 ] .",
    "this leads us to estimate the intrinsic h  i  column in ngc625 at log(n(h  i ) ) @xmath9 20.5@xmath00.3 .",
    "this is at least half a dex lower than the h  i  21 cm emission column density in this region ; comparing the _ fuse _  aperture placement ( see figure  [ figcap1 ] ) with the @xmath2 15  resolution h  i  column density map presented by @xcite , we find that the _ fuse _  aperture is completely enclosed within the 10@xmath36 @xmath16 contour .",
    "we believe that this estimate and associated uncertainty for the sight line probed are robust . using",
    "the 21 cm value would result in a stronger ly@xmath35 profile than the other models shown in figure  [ figcap6 ] ( see the dot - dash line corresponding to log(n(h  i ) ) @xmath9 21 ) .",
    "the difference between our absorption estimate and the 21 cm value could easily be due to the much different solid angles probed by the two measurements ( a size ratio of 2.2:1 exists between the h  i  emission beam and the solid angle of the _ fuse _ mdrs aperture ) .",
    "we discuss the implications of this offset in h  i  absorbing column in more detail in   [ s4 ] .      using these column density estimates and assuming that the observed absorption lines arise from the main elemental species in the neutral ism , we find the following abundances and elemental ratios : [ n / h ] @xmath371.80@xmath00.34 ; [ o / h ] @xmath381.36@xmath00.33 ( we stress again that the o  i  @xmath11039.230   line may be saturated , and hence the lower limit is quoted",

    "these values use the updated solar abundances of holweger ( 2001 ; n , si , fe ) and asplund etal .",
    "( 2004 ; o ) , or the older standard values of anders & grevesse ( 1989 ; ar ) .",
    "these abundances are summarized in table  [ t3 ] .",
    "note that a downward shift of the assumed h  i   column leads to increased abundances , and that an increase in n(h  i ) leads to a decrease in inferred metal abundance ( specifically , if the h  i  column is a factor of 2 larger , as might be inferred from the 21 cm emission in this direction [ see   [ s3.3.1 ] ] , the derived abundances will be a factor of 2 lower than the quoted values ) .",
    "also , the n / o abundance ratio assumes that the neutral gas components are co - spatial ( i.e. , that the ionization correction factor is negligible ) .    keeping in mind the relatively large errors involved with these absorption line abundance measurements , and the points about potential line saturation discussed in ",
    "[ s3.3.3 ] , these neutral gas values can be compared with the nebular abundances presented by @xcite .",
    "therein , for the major star formation region which dominates these _ fuse _",
    "sightlines , the calculated abundance ratios were found to be [ o / h ] @xmath370.47@xmath00.06 and log(n / o ) @xmath371.33@xmath00.02 .",
    "our neutral gas oxygen abundance ( taken at face value ) is found to be lower by @xmath2 0.9 dex , while the relative abundances between n and o are very similar .",
    "the offset between the neutral and nebular gas abundances may indicate that the outer regions of dwarf galaxies are less enriched in heavy elements compared to the inner , star - forming regions .",
    "we discuss this point further and compare to results found for other dwarf starbursts in the literature in   [ s4.3 ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xcite found an elevated n / o ratio in the three highest surface brightness h  ii  regions in ngc625 when compared to other star - forming dwarf galaxies .",
    "this value was found to be comparable to those for blue compact dwarfs , and was postulated to potentially arise as an effect of a long quiescent period prior to the current ( temporally and spatially extended ) star formation episode where the n abundance may be elevated by the evolution of intermediate mass stars",
    ". our neutral gas n / o ratio ( which is equal to the nebular value , within errors ) is also found to be high compared to the neutral n / o values derived for other dwarf starbursts observed with _ fuse _  ( note that if the o  i  @xmath11039.230   line is saturated , the n / o value decreases , moving the ngc625 n / o ratio closer to the values found for other systems ) .",
    "while interpretation of the elevated n / o ratio in the neutral gas of starbursting dwarfs will require a larger statistical sample , it appears that in ngc625 the nucleosynthetic products of intermediate mass stars have been enriching the ism for a long period , and that these products have been mixed into the neutral gas at large separations from the starburst regions ( see also   [ s4.3 ] ) .",
    "as mentioned previously , the o  i  @xmath11039.230   line may be saturated , potentially severely underestimating the true o  i  column density . as shown in @xcite ,",
    "strongly saturated o  i  absorption lines can imply abundance ranges of up to @xmath2 1000 without differences in the goodness of the profile fit . examining the profile of the o  i  line in figure  [ figcap5 ] , it is clear that even this moderate - strength transition [ log(_f_@xmath40 ) @xmath9 0.974 ] is close to saturation in the central regions of the line .",
    "furthermore , since these _ fuse _  data probe multiple sightlines ( see figure  [ figcap1 ] ) , the line may be more heavily saturated than the profile shows , if a luminous continuum source is not shielded by the foreground o  i  region .",
    "for these reasons , we more carefully explore the tests for , and potential effects of , o  i  line saturation .",
    "we can probe the amount of line saturation by subtracting the local rms value from the line profile and re - deriving the column density via the apparent optical depth method .",
    "this exercise shows that the center of the line is within 1@xmath22 of zero flux ; this causes the inferred column density to grow quickly ( see equation  [ eq1 ] and discussion in   [ s3.2 ] ) .",
    "this suggests that the o  i  line is at least partially saturated .",
    "the degree of this saturation can be tested by using tracer species to infer the column of neutral oxygen .",
    "first , si  ii  can be used as a proxy by assuming that the o / si ratio is the same as the solar ratio ( see lu etal .",
    "1998 for details ) .",
    "while uncertain , this method suggests that o  i  saturation may cause the o  i  column to be underestimated by as much as 0.7 dex .",
    "note , however , that si can be depleted onto dust grains , and thus this technique is not without error .",
    "second , p  ii  ( which is less depleted onto dust grains ) can be used as a tracer of the neutral oxygen abundance .",
    "following @xcite , if [ p / o ] @xmath9 0 is assumed for the neutral gas , then the implied column of o  i  is nearly a full dex above that derived from the actual o  i  line profile .",
    "both of these proxy methods imply that the o  i  column has indeed been severely underestimated .",
    "ideally , one would use other oxygen lines in the sic channels to independently test for line saturation . as mentioned previously",
    ", these data lack the s / n in the sic channels to perform such a test .",
    "thus , in lieu of a large sample of o / si and p / o studies of the neutral ism of dwarf galaxies , for the remainder of this paper we explore the results of a column of o  i  as derived above , log(n ) @xmath9 15.80@xmath00.12 , which implies an abundance offset when compared to the nebular regions .",
    "we discuss the implications of this scenario in ",
    "we stress , however , that this o  i  column density is a lower limit and that the effects of line saturation may indeed be pronounced .",
    "the most important results in this paper are as follows : 1 ) the discovery of outflowing coronal gas from a relatively low - luminosity dwarf starburst galaxy ; 2 ) the discovery of diffuse h@xmath4 absorption in a relatively distant , low - metallicity galaxy ; 3 ) the discovery of a possible abundance offset between the nebular and neutral gas phases in a star - forming dwarf galaxy . in this section",
    "we discuss each of these points in more detail and compare the values found for ngc625 with those found for other dwarf starbursts in the literature .",
    "the coronal gas content of low - mass systems that are undergoing outflow episodes is an important component of models of superbubble evolution .",
    "if the coronal gas density is high and radiative cooling is efficient , then outflow energies can be expended prior to the outflow breaking out of the disk and venting hot gas , metals and energy into the surrounding igm . if , on the other hand , the coronal gas density is low and the radiative cooling is inefficient , then the coronal gas does not radiate sufficient energy to slow or stall galactic - scale outflows from low - mass galaxies . while the evolution of outflows is complex and depends on various other factors , coronal gas cooling is one important effect that has only recently become accessible observationally .    in principal , by observing the absorption and emission profiles of outflowing  gas from a galaxy , one can obtain an estimate of the cooling rate of the gas and compare this to the estimated energy input into the ism by the evolution of the massive stars associated with recent star formation ( see heckman etal .",
    "however , such an estimate of the cooling rate in ngc625 is difficult for two reasons .",
    "first , it is not straightforward to extrapolate to an unambiguous outflow cavity size estimate .",
    "second , the low outflow velocity of the  gas with respect to the molecular gas ( and presumably the stellar population ) in ngc625 ( @xmath2 30 kms@xmath3 ) does not cleanly separate the absorption profile from the expected location of  emission ( if we see emission only from the redshifted , back side of a symmetric outflow along the line of sight ) .",
    "these factors complicate estimates of the mass and density of the  gas , both of which are needed to constrain the cooling rate ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    _ fuse _  observations of  emission from other starbursting galaxies have shown that typical cooling rates in coronal gas are small .",
    "@xcite and @xcite estimate that coronal gas cooling is roughly comparable to the energy radiated away in soft x - ray emission in the outflows in ngc1705 and m82 . since the soft x - ray emission radiates only a small fraction of the input energy of the wind @xcite , the cooling rate via coronal gas appears to be small .",
    "a similar column of  gas has been found in ngc625 ( log(n ( ) ) = 14.32@xmath00.08 ) and ngc1705 ( log(n ( ) ) = 14.26@xmath00.08 ) ; because the outflow cavity is likely smaller in ngc625 than in ngc1705 ( implying a smaller mass of cooling plasma ) , it is likely that radiative cooling via coronal gas is not a significant portion of the energy budget of ngc625 .",
    "comparing to the literature , it appears that pronounced  absorption is ubiquitous in actively star - forming systems with non - zero inclinations .",
    "extensive observations through the milky way halo have shown an average   absorption column density of 14.38 @xcite .",
    "similarly , @xcite and @xcite have shown that  absorption is present along tens of sightlines into the large and small magellanic clouds , with average column densities of 14.37 and 14.53 , respectively .",
    "finally , studies of extragalactic dwarf systems with strong current star formation show at least weak  absorption when the major exciting clusters are observed directly ( see heckman etal .",
    "2001 for ngc1705 ; lebouteiller etal .",
    "2004 for izw36 ; the present work for ngc625 ) . a large sample of _ fuse _  dwarf galaxy observations spanning a range of galaxy properties ( star formation rate , outflow velocities , dust content , etc .",

    "diffuse h@xmath4 is a ubiquitous component of the ism of the galaxy . using _",

    "[ s1 ] , extragalactic detections of diffuse h@xmath4 beyond the local group are even more rare .",
    "dwarf starburst galaxies such as ngc625 offer a unique opportunity to study diffuse h@xmath4 in the ism , since they are typically uv - bright , are forming stars rapidly ( implying a sizable molecular reservoir ) , and usually present relatively low extinctions due to their low metal abundances .",
    "even with these apparent observational advantages , however , stringent column density limits of log(n(h@xmath4 ) ) @xmath42 15 in the low - j levels are derived for the metal - deficient starburst galaxies izw18 @xcite , ngc1705 @xcite , mrk59 ( thuan etal .",

    "they also note that some of the systems in their sample have been detected in co tracer lines and that the inferred molecular masses exceed the derived diffuse h@xmath4 masses by many orders of magnitude .",
    "the detection of h@xmath4 absorption in ngc625 highlights the importance of ism geometry in the interpretation of these types of observations .",
    "as shown by @xcite , the dust distribution ( and hence potentially productive areas of h@xmath4 formation ) does not always follow the distribution of uv light .",

    ", the potential for detection of h@xmath4 may be optimized , given the correlation between dust and h@xmath4 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the simplest interpretation of these h@xmath4 observations of nearby dwarf starburst and low - metallicity galaxies appears to be one where the covering factor of diffuse h@xmath4 clouds is low .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since the strength of the uv radiation field appears to be an important factor both theoretically and observationally , it may be expected that sightlines to the uv - brightest clusters may not show diffuse h@xmath4 in absorption . the complicated geometry of dust , neutral and molecular gas , and",
    "the current stellar populations will require a much larger sample to fully understand the nature of diffuse h@xmath4 absorption in extragalactic environments .",
    "in these data we find an apparent abundance difference between the neutral and nebular gas regions in ngc625 .",
    "interestingly , the n / o ratio is , within errors , identical in the neutral and nebular gas phases .",
    "we again emphasize that our @xmath11039.230   line may be saturated ( hence reducing the offset between n and o abundances ) , and that our absolute abundances are comparatively uncertain due to the large error on our measured h  i  column within ngc625 .",
    "however , taken at face value , the offset is large enough ( @xmath2 0.9 dex ) to warrant a more thorough discussion of these values in other systems and the potential implications for the evolution of low - mass galaxies .    as shown in table  [ t3 ] , it appears that such abundance offsets between nebular and neutral gas are common in strongly star - forming dwarf galaxies studied to date with _",

    "2003 ; but see also lecavelier des etangs etal .",
    "2004 for an alternative treatment ) , izw36 @xcite , and mrk59 @xcite .",
    "these abundance differences may be caused by _",
    "sightlines sampling two different components of the ism of dwarf galaxies : lower - abundance halo gas , and higher - abundance gas nearer to the active star formation regions .",
    "a simple test of this `` disk vs. halo '' scenario can be performed by comparing the size of the abundance difference with the difference between the h  i  gas column seen in emission and the h  i  column that can only be foreground to the uv - luminous regions ( i.e. , the h  i  gas probed in _ fuse _",
    "observations ) .",
    "our reasoning is simple : if the absorption arises in the disk of the galaxy , the column density should be comparable to the disk column density , but if the absorption arises in a halo , the column density should be smaller .",
    "we show in figure  [ figcap7 ] a plot of the size of the offset between neutral and nebular gas ( @xmath44(@xmath45o / h@xmath46 $ ] ) @xmath9 @xmath45o / h@xmath46$]@xmath24 @xmath13 @xmath45o / h@xmath46$]@xmath47 ) and the difference in h  i  columns as seen in absorption and in emission toward the same region ( @xmath44(h  i ) @xmath9 log(n(h  i))@xmath48 @xmath13 log(n(h  i))@xmath49 ) . depending on the value chosen for izw18 , there could be a trend of increasing @xmath44(@xmath45o / h@xmath46 $ ] ) with increasing @xmath44(h  i ) .",
    "it appears that each system under study ( with the possible exception of izw18 ) shows some value of abundance offset between the nebular and neutral gas ( see notes to table  [ t3 ] for more details ) .",
    "each of these investigations is susceptible to various sources of error that will require a larger sample to overcome ; however , if these results are supported by further data , it appears that many dwarf galaxies may have a halo of lower - metallicity gas that surrounds the actively star - forming regions as probed by emission line spectroscopy .",
    "this result has important implications for the chemical evolution of star - forming dwarf galaxies , since it implies that widespread enrichment episodes have preceded the current bursts that dominate the bolometric luminosity of these systems .",
    "previous works have postulated a prompt `` self - enrichment '' scenario in the nebular gas region that would be evidenced by localized enrichment near current h  ii  regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this effect has been shown to be small , since local abundance variations are not seen in the nebular regions surrounding massive starbursts in low - mass galaxies ( see kobulnicky & skillman 1996 , kobulnicky & skillman 1997 , kobulnicky etal .",
    "1997 , kobulnicky & skillman 1998 , legrand etal .  2000 , and references therein ) .",
    "the present offset between neutral and nebular gas abundances would require a different enrichment scenario than `` localized enrichment '' , since the absorbing columns are , by definition , foreground to the starburst regions . a potential scenario that would be consistent with these",
    "data is one where low - level star formation persists in dwarf galaxies for extended periods of time , allowing the oxygen and nitrogen abundances to be elevated in the ism and efficiently mixed with the surrounding neutral gas .",
    "this low - level star formation rate would elevate the neutral gas abundances above the primordial value , and the higher nebular values could then be produced by more recent star formation in the current major star formation regions of these systems .",
    "the close agreement in n / o between the nebular and neutral gas also points toward central creation and geometrical dilution over a long time period ; otherwise the different production timescales for n and o become problematic . a larger _ fuse _  sample of actively star forming dwarf galaxies would be most beneficial in addressing the abundance offsets between nebular and neutral gas phases .    if the absorption spectra of dwarf galaxies obtained by _ fuse _ are indeed sampling a halo of neutral gas and are not primarily produced in the disks , then they provide a very important probe of a virtually unstudied component of the dwarf galaxy ism . @xcite have emphasized the importance of measuring abundances in the neutral gas in the outer parts of dwarf galaxies . in spiral galaxies",
    ", it is well known that there are chemical abundance gradients in the sense of lower abundances in the outer parts of the systems . however , in dwarf galaxies it is generally assumed that the entire h  i  disk has the same metallicity as measured in the h  ii  regions , and this is a very uncertain assumption . the physical basis for this assumption is the general uniformity of h  ii  region abundances in dwarf galaxies ( kobulnicky & skillman 1997 and references therein ) , and the inference that the whole h  i  disk is kept at a rather uniform chemical abundance by the rapid transportation of the metals in a hot phase of the ism @xcite .",
    "however , the h  ii  regions only sample the inner parts of the h  i  disk . in some dwarf galaxies , as much as 90% of the neutral hydrogen lies outside of the holmberg radius ( e.g. , ddo154 ; carignan & freeman 1988 ; carignan & purton 1998 ) .",
    "if dwarf galaxies do have chemical abundance gradients , then assuming that the chemical abundances are constant overestimates the total metal content of the galaxy , and leads to a misinterpretation of their evolutionary status ( e.g. , artificially inflating the calculated effective yield ) .",
    "the edge - on orientation of ngc625 implies that at least some of the absorption is occurring in the outer parts of the galaxy and thus providing a probe of this relatively unexplored ism component .",
    "the extended mission of _ fuse _  offers an ideal opportunity to test for this important evolutionary scenario .",

    "deep integrations on such targets will provide sufficient s / n to allow inter - comparison of the columns derived from oxygen lines with different oscillator strengths throughout the _ fuse _  spectral region . with the effects of line saturation eliminated",

    "this detection adds to the sample of extragalactic systems showing outflowing coronal gas . with these data",
    "alone we can not constrain the efficiency of cooling in the coronal gas ; however , comparing to the literature and given the strength of the  absorption feature , we suggest that radiative cooling is likely not a dominant mechanism in the loss of energy from the ngc625 outflow .",
    "our second major result is that we have detected low rotational level transitions from the lyman and werner bands of diffuse h@xmath4 gas in ngc625 .",
    "this is one of only a few dwarf galaxies outside of the local group to show diffuse h@xmath4 in _ fuse",
    "_  observations .",
    "it is likely that the geometry of the stellar populations , dust , neutral and dense molecular gas all play a role in determining if h@xmath4 is detectable in such systems .",
    "we interpret the low molecular fraction , which is similar to that found in other dwarf starburst and low - metallicity galaxies from _ fuse _  studies , to the low covering factor of h@xmath4 clouds , which are expected to be comparatively small and dense in these actively star - forming , metal - deficient environments .",
    "our final important result is that we have found a potential abundance offset between the nebular and neutral gas phases of ngc625 .",
    "while the absolute oxygen abundance is hindered by potential saturation and the intrinsic h  i   column is only constrained to @xmath00.3 dex , the magnitude of the offset ( @xmath2 0.9 dex ) suggests that it is likely real .",
