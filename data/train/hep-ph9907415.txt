    "the change of sign in @xmath61 makes , in the region of the dip , the ( @xmath62 ) line higher than the ( + ) line , flattening the dips .",
    "in the present work , starting from a parametrization @xcite suggested by the model of the stochastic vaccum @xcite , we relate the behavior of the dips of the elastic differential cross section to the locations of the zeros of the amplitudes in pp and p@xmath0 scattering , and investigate the role of the sign of the large @xmath1 tail for these systems , in the range @xmath6319 - 63 gev .",
    "the pp amplitude presents one zero in the imaginary part and two zeros in the real part .",
    "the depth of the dips is determined by the proximity between the zeros of the imaginary part and the second zeros of the real part , so that the dips become deeper when these zeros are closer to each other . in p@xmath0 scattering the real amplitude has only the first zero , which occurs far away from the dip region .",
    "the large @xmath1 tail of the differential cross section is described by an exponential term included in the real part of the amplitude .",
    "this term , which is the same ( except for a sign ) for pp and p@xmath0 at all energies from 19 to 63 gev , is responsible for the change of shape of the dip region when we change from pp to p@xmath0 systems .",
    "the sign ( which is positive for pp scattering ) determines flatter dips in p@xmath0 scattering .",
    "this fact , which was pointed out by donnachie and landshoff @xcite , is here confirmed by the detailed description of all data .",
