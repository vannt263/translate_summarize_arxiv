    "m  82 is one of the nearest and brightest starburst galaxies .",
    "located at a distance of 3.9  mpc , and with a bolometric luminosity of 3.7@xmath410@xmath7  l@xmath8 , it has been extensively studied in many molecules .",
    "several studies reveal that the starburst has heavily influenced the interstellar medium in m  82 by producing high uv and cosmic ray fluxes .",
    "recent interferometric observations at millimeter wavelengths @xcite show that while the chemistry of the molecular gas in the disk - halo interface is dominated by shocks , the chemistry of the molecular gas in the m  82 disk seems to be dominated by the intense uv flux .",
    "@xcite obtained a high - angular - resolution image showing widespread enhanced hco abundance ( [ hco]/[h@xmath5co@xmath0]@xmath33.6 ) across the whole m  82 disk which was interpreted in terms of a giant pdr of 650  pc size .",
    "fuente et al . 2005 ( hereafter paper i ) observed a selected set of pdr tracers ( cn , c@xmath9h , hoc@xmath0 and c - c@xmath10h@xmath9 ) in three positions across the m  82 disk .",
    "they measured [ cn]/[hcn]@xmath35 in the inner 650  pc galaxy disk .",
    "this large value of the [ cn]/[hcn ] ratio is only reached in the most heavily exposed layers of a pdr to the uv radiation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we detected the hoc@xmath0 1@xmath110 line and obtained * an * [ hco@xmath0]/[hoc@xmath0 ] ratio of @xmath3 40 .",
    "such a low [ hco@xmath0]/[hoc@xmath0 ] ratio is only expected in highly ionized molecular gas ( x(e@xmath12)@xmath210@xmath13 ) either by uv photons ( pdrs ) and/or x - rays ( xdrs ) @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we report the co@xmath0 detection in the nucleus of m  82 .",
    "this is the first secure co@xmath0 detection in an extragalactic object since previously it has only been tentatively detected towards the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) cygnus a @xcite .",
    "co@xmath0 is a reactive ion that can only survive in the highly ionized layers of photon - dominated and x - rays dominated regions ( pdrs and xdrs ) ( see e.g. sternberg & dalgarno 1995 ) . in our galaxy",
    ", co@xmath0 has only been detected in a handful of objects which are well known prototypical pdrs ( ngc 7027 and m17 sw : latter et al .",
    "1993 , fuente et al . 2003",
    "; the orion bar : strzer et al . 1995 , fuente et al . 2003 ; ngc 7023 : fuente & martn - pintado 1997 , fuente et al . 2003 ; mon r2 and g29.96 - 0.02 : rizzo et al . 2003 ; s140 and ngc  2023 : savage & ziurys 2004 ) . in fact , co@xmath0 may be the best molecular tracer of the outermost layers ( a@xmath14@xmath22  mag ) of pdrs .",
    "in contrast with other molecular pdr tracers like cn and hoc@xmath0 , co@xmath0 is exclusively formed in these layers by reactions of c@xmath0 with oh . the formation of the chemically related ion hoc@xmath0 is favored in this region but can also be formed at a smaller rate in molecular clouds .",
    "in addition to the co@xmath0 detection , we present observations of the high excitation hco@xmath0 3@xmath112 , hoc@xmath0 3@xmath112 and the ch@xmath10oh 5@xmath15@xmath114@xmath15 lines .",
    "the observations were carried out in june and november 2004 with the iram 30 m radiotelescope at pico de veleta ( spain ) .",
    "we used 2 sis receivers tuned in single - sideband mode in the 1 mm band .",

    "1 we present the observed spectra and the gaussian fits are shown in table 1 . the intensity scale is main beam brightness temperature . the forward efficiency ( @xmath17 ) , main - beam efficiency ( @xmath18 ) and half - power beam width ( hpbw ) of the telescope are 0.91,0.52 and 11@xmath19 at 235 ghz and 0.88 , 0.46 and 9@xmath19 at 260 ghz .",
    "pointing was checked every two hours by observing a reference source .",
    "we observed three positions across the m  82 disk in the co@xmath0 lines : the nucleus ( ra(2000 ) : 09@xmath2055@xmath2151.9@xmath22 , dec(2000 ) : 69@xmath2304@xmath2447.11@xmath19 ) ( hereafter referred to as _ center _ ) and the two peaks in the hco emission [ offsets ( @xmath2514@xmath19,@xmath255@xmath19 ) and ( @xmath2614@xmath19,@xmath265@xmath19 ) hereafter referred to as _",

    "the hoc@xmath0 3@xmath112 line has been detected towards _ e_.",
    "this detection constitutes a further corroboration of the hoc@xmath0  1@xmath110 detection reported in paper i. the ch@xmath10oh line was only observed towards _ center_.      co@xmath0 has a @xmath27@xmath28 ground electronic state in which each rotational level is split into two fine - structure levels with j = n@xmath291/2 . the n=1@xmath110 rotational line is heavily obscured by the o@xmath9 line at 118 ghz and can not be observed from ground - based telescopes .",
    "the most intense transitions of the n=2@xmath111 rotational spectrum are j=5/2@xmath113/2 at 236.062 ghz and j=3/2@xmath111/2 at 235.789 ghz .",
    "since they are very close in frequency , the two lines can be observed simultaneously . in the optically thin limit , the intensity ratio i(236.062)/i(235.789 )",
    "the detection of the two lines with the expected intensity ratio provides supporting evidence of the reality of the co@xmath0 detection .",
    "the co@xmath0 n=2@xmath111 j=5/2@xmath113/2 line has been detected towards _",
    "e _ ( @xmath24@xmath30 ) and _ center _ ( @xmath28@xmath30 ) and very tentatively ( @xmath33@xmath30 ) towards _",
    "w_. furthermore , we have a @xmath33@xmath30 detection of the weakest component towards _ center_. the 236.062 ghz co@xmath0 line is blended with the 5@xmath31@xmath114@xmath32 and 5@xmath33@xmath114@xmath34 e lines of @xmath5ch@xmath10oh ( at 236.062 and 236.063ghz respectively ) . to confirm the co@xmath0 detection and estimate the possible contamination of the 13-methanol lines , we have observed towards _",
    "center _ the same transitions of the abundant isotope @xmath35ch@xmath10oh and obtained t@xmath36@xmath310  mk . assuming a @xmath35c/@xmath5c ratio @xmath250 @xcite , the intensity of the ch@xmath10oh line should be @xmath370.2  mk towards _ center _",
    ", i.e. , at least a factor of 30 lower than the intensity observed in the co@xmath0 spectrum .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that the detected emission at 236.062 ghz corresponds to the j=3/2@xmath111/2 line of co@xmath0 .",
    "the physical conditions of the molecular gas are estimated by fitting the intensities of the h@xmath5co@xmath0 1@xmath110 and hco@xmath0 3@xmath112 lines using an lvg code .",
    "for these calculations , we assume t@xmath38=50  k @xcite and [ hco@xmath0]/[h@xmath5co@xmath0]=89 .",
    "the @xmath35c/@xmath5c ratio in the m  82 nucleus is not well known .",
    "@xcite derived a @xmath35c/@xmath5c ratio between 50 and 75 from multiline co observations using an lvg code .",
    "however they obtained a larger value of the @xmath35c/@xmath5c ratio when applying a pdr model to the same data .",
    "for consistency with paper i , we adopt the canonical value [ hco@xmath0]/[h@xmath5co@xmath0]=89 .",
    "the derived molecular hydrogen densities are 38@xmath410@xmath39  @xmath40 .",

    "_ and _ center _ we obtain the h@xmath5co@xmath0 and hoc@xmath0 column densities shown in table 2 .",
    "the size of the emission towards _ e _ , _ w _ and _ center _ has been derived from the interferometric hco and h@xmath5co@xmath0 images published by @xcite ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "to calculate the co@xmath0 column density , we assume optically thin emission and use the local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) approximation with t@xmath42=10  k. this rotation temperature has been estimated using a lvg code applied to a linear molecule with the same dipole moment as co@xmath0 and n(h@xmath9)=10@xmath43  @xmath40 . assuming a size of 6@xmath41 for the co@xmath0 emission we derive co@xmath0 column densities @xmath314@xmath410@xmath5  @xmath6 across the m  82 disk .",
    "we can calculate the [ hco@xmath0]/[hoc@xmath0 ] ratio towards _",
    "e _ using the hco@xmath0 3@xmath112 and hoc@xmath0  3@xmath112 lines . since both lines lie at the same frequency and have similar dipole moments , [ hco@xmath0]/[hoc@xmath0]@xmath44i(hco@xmath0  3@xmath112)/i(hoc@xmath0  3@xmath112 ) ratio .",
    "we obtain [ hco@xmath0]/[hoc@xmath0]@xmath4448 in excellent agreement with our previous estimates ( paper i ) .    in table  2",
    "we compare the column density ratios in m  82 with those measured in some prototypical galactic pdrs .",
    "the [ co@xmath0]/[hco@xmath0 ] ratio is larger than 0.04 all across the m  82 disk .",
    "this is one of the largest values of the [ co@xmath0]/[hco@xmath0 ] ratio measured thus far .",
    "values of the [ co@xmath0]/[hco@xmath0 ] ratio larger than 0.01 are only found towards the atomic peaks in prototypical galactic pdrs , and such a high value of the [ co@xmath0]/[hco@xmath0 ] ratio has only been measured in the most exposed layers of the pdr associated with the reflection nebula ngc  7023 .",
    "this result is consistent with the values of the [ hco@xmath0]/[hoc@xmath0 ] and [ cn]/[hcn ] ratios previously measured in the m  82 disk ( paper i ) .",
    "we estimated [ hco@xmath0]/[hoc@xmath0]@xmath340 and [ cn]/[hcn]@xmath25 across the m  82 nucleus .",
    "these values are also similar to those measured in the pdr peak towards ngc  7023 . the very favorable geometry of the pdr associated with this reflection nebula allowed us to detect the outermost layers of the pdr @xcite .",
    "our observations suggest that the bulk of the dense molecular gas in m  82 is surviving in a similar environment to that found in the hi / h@xmath9 transition layer of this photon - dominated region .",
    "we can also compare the co@xmath0 , hoc@xmath0 and cn column densities in m  82 with those derived in galactic pdrs , although the derived column densities are more uncertain than the column density ratios since the former depend on the assumed beam filling factor . in galactic pdrs , the co@xmath0 column densities are quite uniform taking a value of @xmath310@xmath35  @xmath6 in all star forming regions regardless of the incident uv field in a range of 3 orders of magnitude .",
    "furthermore , the [ co@xmath0 ] /[hoc@xmath0 ] ratio is @xmath30.59 @xcite .",
    "the [ co@xmath0]/[hoc@xmath0 ] ratio measured in m  82 is similar to those found in the pdrs associated with star forming regions in our galaxy ( see table 2 ) .",
    "this suggests a similar co@xmath0/hco@xmath0/hoc@xmath0 chemistry and a similar origin for the reactive ions .",
    "since the co@xmath0 column density is a factor 20 - 40 larger in m  82 than in galactic pdrs , we need about 20 - 40 pdrs along the line of sight to account for our observations . in the scenario of clouds immersed in a pervasive uv field",
    ", this implies about 1020 clouds along the line of sight which is a reasonable number for an edge - on galaxy .",
    "to have a deeper insight into the physics and chemistry of the molecular clouds in m  82 , we have modeled their chemistry using the pdr le bourlot s semi - infinite plane parallel model ( le bourlot et al .",
    "1993 ) and the same physical conditions as in paper i : g@xmath45=10@xmath39 in units of habing field , n = n@xmath46 + 2@xmath4n@xmath47=4@xmath410@xmath43  @xmath40 and a cosmic ray flux of 4@xmath410@xmath48  s@xmath49 .",
    "as discussed in paper i , this model explains with reasonable success all the molecular abundances observed in m  82 and should therefore account for our co@xmath0 detection .",
    "the model results for co@xmath50 and hco@xmath0 are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the n(co@xmath0)/n(hco@xmath0 ) ratio ( hereafter @xmath51 ) is very high ( @xmath20.1 ) for a@xmath14@xmath370.5  mag .",
    "then , @xmath51 remains constant and equal to @xmath30.1 until a@xmath14@xmath375  mag .",
    "this is because in this range of visual extinction , 0.5@xmath37a@xmath14@xmath374.5  mag , @xmath51 is determined by the co@xmath0 and hco@xmath0 abundances in the most external layers ( a@xmath14@xmath371  mag ) of the pdr . for higher extinctions",
    ", @xmath51 decreases because of the rapid increase of the hco@xmath0 abundance . in our plane - parallel model ,",
    "the values of @xmath51 observed across the m  82 nucleus ( @xmath51@xmath20.04 ) are found only for a@xmath14@xmath376.5  mag ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "in an external galaxy , one does not expect to have a single pdr but a population of clouds ( or cloudlets ) immersed in an intense uv field ( paper i , garca - burillo et al .",
    "2002 ) . in this scenario ,",
    "our model results imply that the individual cloudlets have n@xmath52@xmath531.3  10@xmath54  @xmath6 .",
    "thus , our co@xmath0 observations corroborate the scenario for the m  82 nucleus proposed in paper i of a highly fragmented interstellar medium in which the dense cores ( n@xmath34@xmath410@xmath43  @xmath40 , n@xmath52@xmath531.3@xmath410@xmath54  @xmath6 ) are bathed by an intense uv field ( g@xmath45=10@xmath39 habing fields ) .",
    "thus far , we have only compared the observed and model predicted molecular column density ratios .",
    "we can also compare the molecular column densities .",
    "the predicted co@xmath0 column density is @xmath33@xmath410@xmath7  @xmath6 for a@xmath14=6.5  mag .",
    "this value is a factor of 2040 lower than the co@xmath0 column densities observed in the prototypical galactic pdrs .",
    "furthermore it is 3 orders of magnitude lower than the co@xmath0 column densities measured in m  82 and an unrealistic large number of pdrs along the line of sight would be required to explain our co@xmath0 observations . to have a deeper insight into the cause of this discrepancy between theoretical predictions and the observations ,",
    "we have also compared the predicted cn column densities with the observed ones ( see table 1 ) . like co@xmath0 ,",
    "cn is a good tracer of pdrs and can be used to estimate the number of pdrs along the line of sight .",
    "our model predicts n(cn)@xmath31.5@xmath410@xmath55  @xmath6 for a@xmath14@xmath36.5  mag .",
    "this value agrees within a factor of 2 with those observed in prototypical galactic pdrs like the orion bar and ngc  7023 . comparing with the cn column densities observed in the m  82 nucleus , we need about 20 - 40 individual cloudlets along the line of sight to account for our observations ( see also boger & sternberg 2005 ) .",
    "this is a reasonable number of cloudlets for an edge - on galaxy .",
    "thus , there is a reasonable agreement between model predictions and observations for cn in both , galactic and extra - galactic pdrs .",
    "however , the chemical model falls short by more than one order of magnitude of accounting for the co@xmath0 column densities measured in galactic pdrs and the m  82 nucleus .",
    "the failure of chemical models to account for the observed reactive ions column densities is a long standing problem @xcite .",
    "the chemistry of reactive ions is very sensitive to the gas physical conditions in the hi / h@xmath9 transition layer . in particular , co@xmath0 is mainly produced via the reaction c@xmath0+oh@xmath11co@xmath0+h .",
    "the production of oh is very dependent on the temperature as o+h@xmath9 may come into play at the h / h@xmath9 transition region when h@xmath9 is abundant and the temperature is still a few hundred k. the corresponding endothermicity is about 3000  k. an increase in the gas kinetic temperature in the hi / h@xmath9 interface could have a dramatic effect in the co@xmath0 production .",
    "there are several observational evidences that suggest that chemical models fail to predict the gas kinetic temperature in the hi / h@xmath9 region .",
    "one of the best studied pdrs is the orion bar , which is the paradigm of a galactic pdr associated to an hii region .",
    "observations of the h@xmath9 rotational lines in the orion bar by @xcite revealed the existence of unexpectedly large amounts of warm gas ( t@xmath3400 - 700  k ) .",
    "they proposed that clumpiness could help to reconcile the observations with chemical models .",
    "recently , @xcite proposed that the dust fuv attenuation cross sections should be reduced by a factor of 3 in order to explain the separation between the ionization front and the h@xmath9 emission peak in the orion bar . in order to explain the intensities of the h@xmath9 ro - vibrational lines they need to re - adjust the photoelectric heating rate . a change in the size distribution of the grains and/or",
    "the photoelectric heating rate would produce large variations in the thermal balance of the pdr .",
