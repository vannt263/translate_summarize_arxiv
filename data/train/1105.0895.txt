    "quantifying density fluctuations in a condensed phase is interesting from a statistical physics perspective . for example , the probability  @xmath0 of finding @xmath1  fluid particles in a probe volume  @xmath2 contains information about many - body correlations in the fluid .",
    "calculations of @xmath0 in liquid water have significantly enhanced our understanding of hydrophobicity .",
    "in particular , as the hydration of an idealized solvent - excluding hydrophobic solute is equivalent to the creation of a cavity with the same size and shape as that of the solute , the excess free energy , @xmath3 , of solute hydration is @xmath4  @xcite . in 1996 , hummer _",
    "et al . _ showed that in bulk water , @xmath0 distributions are gaussian for small spherical volumes containing fewer than ten water molecules on average @xcite .",
    "this simplicity formed the basis for an information theoretic model that could predict the thermodynamics of hydrophobic hydration and the association of small solutes over a range of conditions , using only the readily available information on the average density and the water radial distribution function @xcite .",
    "gaussian statistics of density fluctuations @xcite also underlies the pratt - chandler theory  @xcite , which employs the same information to estimate pair correlation functions for small hydrated hydrophobic species .",
    "while small solutes can be accommodated in cavities that are formed spontaneously by thermal fluctuations in bulk water , solvating large solutes requires forming a liquid - vapor - like interface @xcite . as a result , the nature of density fluctuations in large volumes is more complex .",
    "the lum - chandler - weeks ( lcw ) theory captures the lengthscale dependence of hydration quantitatively by combining the physics of gaussian density fluctuations and that of interface formation  @xcite .",
    "specifically , it predicts that while @xmath0 for large volumes is gaussian around the mean , the low-@xmath1 wings of the distribution are enhanced substantially  @xcite . quantifying these rare water fluctuations in large volumes is essentially impossible in equilibrium molecular simulations , and requires non - boltzmann or umbrella sampling methods  @xcite .",
    "straightforward umbrella sampling of @xmath1 , is further complicated by the fact that @xmath1 is a discontinuous function of particle coordinates , resulting in impulsive forces , which are difficult to treat in typical molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations . to circumvent this difficulty , patel _ et al .",
    "_ recently introduced an indirect umbrella sampling ( indus ) method in which @xmath1 is sampled indirectly , by biasing a coarse - grained variable ,  @xmath5 , which is strongly correlated with @xmath1 but varies continuously with particle coordinates  @xcite .",
    "the original implementation of indus is suitable only for cuboidal volumes , and showed that for large volumes in bulk water , @xmath0 indeed deviates significantly from gaussian behavior at low  @xmath1 , reflecting the underlying physics of interface formation  @xcite .",
    "application of indus to sample density fluctuations in large volumes in interfacial environments showed that fluctuations near hydrophilic surfaces are similar to those in bulk , but near hydrophobic interfaces , the probability of density depletion is significantly enhanced  @xcite .",
    "the ability to calculate @xmath0 , and especially @xmath6 , in large volumes near interfaces also allowed us to calculate the binding free energies of hydrophobic cuboids to surfaces with a range of chemistries  @xcite , and these binding free energies were shown to correlate with the macroscopic wetting properties of the surfaces .",
    "thus , @xmath0 is a potential molecular measure of hydrophobicity , which may enable the characterization of surfaces of proteins and biomolecules that exhibit nanoscale roughness and chemical heterogeneity  @xcite .    here",
    ", we extend indus such that it can be used to umbrella sample probe volumes of other regular shapes , _ e.g. _ , with cylindrical and spherical symmetry , as well as intersections and unions of collections of such regular volumes and their complements . while the ideas underlying the extension are simple , they considerably widen the scope of the method .",
    "for example , they allow umbrella sampling of arbitrarily shaped volumes , enabling faithful characterization of flucuations in the hydration shells of ions , nanoparticles , nanotubes , and the rugged surfaces of proteins .    we also extend the method to work in the npt ensemble .",
    "previous applications of indus were performed in the nvt ensemble with a buffering vapor - liquid interface . while the two schemes yield indistinguishable results at low pressures , the present extension allows access to a much broader range of pressures .",
    "we begin by describing the indus method of ref .",
    "@xcite , which is suitable for cuboidal probe volumes , and introduce the pertinent equations , which lays down the framework for extending the method to other regular volumes .",
    "we then generalize these equations to volumes of more general shapes and to collections of such volumes , and describe how indus affects the calculation of system pressure .",
    "finally , we demonstrate these generalizations by calculating @xmath0 in various noncuboidal shapes and at high pressures .",
    "the number of particles , @xmath1 , in a specific probe volume , @xmath2 , changes discontinuously as the center of any particle crosses the surface of @xmath2 . hence ,",
    "if the biasing potential , @xmath7 , were chosen to be a function of @xmath1 , it would result in impulsive forces .",
    "instead , we choose @xmath7 to be a function of a closely related coarse - grained particle number , @xmath8 , that is a continuous function of the positions , @xmath9 , of all @xmath10 particles in the system as , @xmath11 the integral in eq .",
    "1b is over the probe volume @xmath2 , and the integrand is a coarse - graining function , @xmath12 , which we choose to be @xmath13 \\theta ( { \\alpha_{\\text{c}}}- |\\alpha| ) .",

    "the correlation between @xmath5 and @xmath1 is thus strongest when @xmath19 is smallest , but if @xmath19 is chosen to be too small , the resulting biasing forces may be too large to handle correctly in typical md simulations .    , as defined in eq .",
