    "the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) offers a unique opportunity for studying supernovae and supernova remnants ( snrs ) in varied environments .",
    "all objects within the lmc can be considered essentially at the same distance of @xmath3 ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) and is essentially a thin ( @xmath4  parsec ) disk inclined at only 35  degrees to our line of sight @xcite .",
    "this permits accurate nebular and physical parameters to be determined for lmc snrs .",
    "furthermore , the lmc is close enough to resolve the structure and morphology of individual extended objects contained within it , such as snrs .",
    "these studies are enhanced by the small uncertainty in absorption towards the lmc ( e.g. @xcite ) .    the best approach",
    "to identify snr candidates is through the use of multi - wavelength surveys .",
    "most commonly , these surveys include the , radio and optical domains , although snrs also produce a large number of emission lines in the ultraviolet ( uv ) and infrared ( ir ) wavelength regimes . in the radio ,",
    "techniques to distinguish between snrs and the other nebula types are based on their strongly polarized and non - thermal emission .",
    "snrs have an average radio spectral index ( defined as @xmath5 ) of @xmath6 @xcite compared to hiiregions which have much flatter spectra of @xmath7  0 . in the optical , narrowband imaging at h@xmath2 , [ sii ]  and",
    "[ oiii]wavelengths can be a useful discriminant as the morphological details , such as spherical ( shell ) symmetry and filamentary structure is helpful in distinguishing snrs from other sources such as hii  regions and superbubbles , especially as a function of the imaged line .",
    "comparison of their spectral emission - line signatures from spectroscopy allows for more unequivocal identification of snrs via specific , diagnostic line ratios , particularly [ sii ]  relative to h@xmath2  ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the first snr radio identification in the lmc was made using the parkes radio telescope at 1410  mhz with a resolution of about 14  @xcite and the most extensive work in identifying magellanic clouds snrs was conducted by @xcite ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "recently , we have identified 76 snrs within the lmc of which 32 are new snr candidates ( filipovi et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "currently , the identifications are based solely on each object s morphological structure from our powerful new radio mosaic images of the lmc so additional corroborating data such as presented here is extremely useful .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the multi - wavelength properties of one of the lmc remnants recovered in our new survey : snr  b0513692 .",
    "we do this by bringing together new and archival radio , x - ray and optical imagery , together with new optical spectroscopy and a fresh assessment of the surrounding environment .",
    "snr  b0513692 ( j051315691219 ) was first confirmed as a snr by @xcite who studied its morphology , non - thermal radio spectra and filamentary h@xmath2  emission .    in the radio band , they used detections from @xcite with the molonglo observatory synthesis telescope ( most ) at 843  mhz , and from @xcite with molonglo radio data at 408  mhz , to examine the radio morphology and to determine a radio spectral index of @xmath8 - 0.5 .",
    "an initial detection of the remnant candidate was based on data obtained from the archives of the columbia",

    "australian telescope ( aat ) coupled with narrow - band interference filters centred on key optical emission lines to image a @xmath9  arcmin region of the remnant .",
    "in particular they found the [ sii]/h@xmath2  point - to - point ratio of this object was typically @xmath10 .",
    "such a high value is a classic signature of a likely snr @xcite .",
    "their narrow - band observations showed the filamentary h@xmath2  emission following the overall radio structure .",
    "they also found an intense , compact emission component at the north - east of the remnant which corresponds to a compact radio source also noted .",
    "they identified this source as a likely , unrelated , hii  region .    here , we present a more detailed multi - radio frequency , multi - wavelength study of this lmc snr and its immediate environs in order to provide a better picture of this little studied object and to shed light on the nature of the compact radio source on the north - eastern edge and its optical counterparts .",
    "we now propose that there are , in fact , two additional , separate sources on the ne boundary of b0513692 .",
    "one is confirmed as the previously catalogued compact hii  region dem l109 , but the other appears to be a small , unrelated , compact new snr candidate which we designate j0512376911 , overlapping both the hii  region and the larger remnant b0513692 .",
    "the new radio - continuum observations of snr b0513692 were performed in snap - shot mode ( integration time was about 0.7  hours at each frequency ) using the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) at 4790  mhz and 8640  mhz on 6 april 1997 .",
    "we used the 375-m array configuration which includes 10 baselines between the first and fifth antenna and an additional five ( 5 ) spacings when a 6-km antenna was used for higher resolution imaging .",

    "there is a possible influence from high - energy uv photons from the nearby star cluster ogle - cl lmc241 to the ionization of the young snr , but no stratification of ionized material in the visible part of the shell ( outside of the hii  region ) is detected . with appropriate radio observations ( wider atca configuration and longer integration time ) , one could construct a distribution of the young snr spectral index , and map spectral changes across the remnant s shell .",

    "tends to occur in a sequential manner , i.e. star formation moves away from the primordial cloud .",
    "since the young snr appears centered well outside the nebula , one plausible scenario could be that the progenitor of this remnant belongs to an older generation of nearby massive stars .",
    "perhaps some earlier sn explosions in an earlier cluster triggered star formation in an adjacent molecular cloud .",
    "so , all three objects ( both snrs and compact hii  region ) could have originated from the nearby molecular cloud as an evolutionary effect .",

    "its polarized , steep ( @xmath2=-0.4@xmath34 - 0.1 ) non - thermal radio emission and presence of emission , leave no doubt of its true nature .",
    "the existence of a symmetry axis with features like mirror symmetry and low - brightness regions at the end of the axis ( see fig.[fig5b ] ) , place this remnant in the barrel - shape morphological class @xcite .",

    "the later assumption is supported with the measured presence of a relatively strong large - scale magnetic field in this region of the lmc @xcite .",
    "presence of significant polarization suggests that the magnetic fields within the shell are highly ordered and relatively strong .",
    "in fact , we find that the estimated level of polarisation of this snr ( 49% ) is among the strongest ever found for an snr",
    ". there is no detected pulsar associated with snr  b0513692 .",

    "the compact and strong nature of the radio source j051324691049 most likely prevents any separate signature from this adjacent snr candidate being seen in the current radio data .",
    "we strongly suggest that j0513276911 is a new , separate , snr . due to the small angular size of this new snr candidate one would assume a young nature but the lack of a confirmed strong counterpart of this object could be a strong argument against this presumption though we do propose a possible explanation for the unusually low brightness of the source . to begin with the existing _ rosat",

    "furthermore , the observations did not cover this area completely ( the centre of the both rosat pspc and hri pointings are well away from the new snr candidate ) .",
    "another possibility is that this new snr candidate is interacting with the nearby high density molecular cloud and that the shock has already decelerated to the point where the gas temperature downstream of the shock is below the emitting temperature .",
    "this reduced emission could be strongly absorbed along the line of sight @xcite .",
    "finally , the spatial resolution of previous x - ray observations ( @xmath6345  arcsec ) would not be enough to resolve this new and small snr from the edge of larger nearby snr b0513692 . only new chandra / xmm and deeper atca observations of this area may solve true nature of this intriguing object .",

    "there are several hii  regions associated with compact groups of young star clusters within @xmath83  pc of the observed field @xcite but nothing of the significance and magnitude as the 30 doradus or n11 star forming regions .",
    "finally the rare superposition of two snrs in the lmc at different stages of evolution , but presumably in a similar ism environment , provides interesting opportunities to unravel any possible interaction and environmental issues through detailed chemical and kinematical analysis .",
