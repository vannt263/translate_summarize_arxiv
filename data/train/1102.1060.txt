    "numerous infrared space observatories , first of all , the spitzer space telescope , as well as msx and iso satellites , opened up a new era in studies of the star formation both in nearby and distant galaxies . the so - called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pah ) @xcite  macromolecules consisting of several tens or several hundred atoms , mostly carbon and hydrogen",
    " are of special interest in relation to these observations .",
    "the absorption of an ultraviolet ( uv ) photon by such a molecule excites bending and vibrational modes , and , as a result , near ir photons are emitted .",
    "pah emission bands may account for a substantial fraction ( up to several dozen percent ) of the entire infrared luminosity of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons attract considerable interest at least for two reasons .",
    "first , their emission is related to the overall uv radiation field of a galaxy , making them a natural indicator of the star formation rate .",
    "second , pah molecules not only trace the state of the interstellar medium , but also play an important role in its physical and chemical evolution .",
    "the former aspect is interesting both for interpretation of available ir observations and for planning new near - ir space missions ( jwst , sofia , spica , etc . ) .",
    "the latter aspect is of great importance for development of models for various objects ranging from protoplanetary disks to the interstellar medium of an entire galaxy .",
    "unfortunately , pah formation and destruction mechanisms in the interstellar medium still are not understood .",
    "such possible scenarios as the synthesis of pahs in carbon - rich atmospheres of agb and post - agb stars or in dense molecular clouds as well as the destruction of pahs by shocks and uv radiation are discussed extensively in the literature ( see sandstrom et al .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the observed deficit of the emission of these macromolecules in metal - poor galaxies may be an important indication of the nature of the pah evolutionary cycle .",
    "note that , as shown by draine et al .",
    "@xcite , this deficit is related to the real lack of pahs and not to the low efficiency of the excitation of their ir transitions . in galaxies with oxygen abundance",
    "@xmath3 the typical mass fraction of pahs @xmath4 ( the fraction of the total dust mass in particles consisting of at most one thousand atoms ) is equal to about 4% , i.e. , about the same as in the milky way . at metallicities @xmath5 the average @xmath4 decreases quite sharply down to 1% and even lower .    in order to carify the cause of this transition and to identify the pah formation and destruction mechanisms as well as their relation to the physical parameters and the metallicity of a galaxy , sandstrom et al .",
    "@xcite analyzed in detail spitzer observations of the dust component in the nearest irregular dwarf galaxy  the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) .",
    "these authors found weak correlation or no correlation between @xmath4 and such smc parameters as the location of carbon - rich asymptotic giant branch stars , supergiant hi shells and young supernova remnants , and the turbulent mach number .",
    "they showed that @xmath4 correlates with co intensity and increases in regions of high dust and molecular gas surface density .",
    "sandstrom et al .",
    "@xcite concluded that pah mass fraction is high in regions of active star formation , but suppressed in bright hii regions .",
    "the irregular dwarf galaxy ic  10 is analogous to the smc in terms of a number of parameters .",
    "the average gas metallicity in ic  10 is @xmath6 , varying from 7.6 to 8.5 in different hii regions ( @xcite and references therein ) , i.e. , it covers the very range where the transition from high to low pah abundance occurs .",
    "the interstellar medium of this galaxy is characterized by a filamentary , multi - shell structure . in h@xmath0 and [ sii ] images ic  10 appears as a giant complex of multiple shells and supershells , arc- and ring - shaped features with sizes ranging from 50 to 8001000  pc ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the hi distribution also shows numerous `` holes '' , supershells , and extended irregular features with rudiments of a spiral pattern @xcite .",
    "the ic  10 galaxy is especially attractive for the analysis of the dust component because , unlike the smc , it is a starburst galaxy .",
    "it is often classified as a bcd - type object because of its high h@xmath0 and ir luminosity  @xcite .",
    "the stellar population of ic  10 shows evidence of two star formation bursts .",
    "the first burst is at least 350 myr old , while the second one has occurred 410 million years ago ( see @xcite and references therein ) . for",
    "the purpose of identifying the influence of shocks and/or uv radiation on dust the anomalously large population of wolf  rayet ( wr ) stars in ic  10 is of special interest . here",
    "the highest density of wr stars is observed among the known dwarf galaxies , comparable to the density of these stars in massive spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "high h@xmath0 and ir luminosity of ic  10 , combined with the large number of wr stars , indicates that the last burst of star formation in this galaxy must have been short , but engulfed most of the galaxy .",
    "the anomalously high number of wr stars means that we are actually witnessing a short period immediately after the last episode of star formation .",
    "the central , brightest region , associated with this last star formation episode , is located in the south - eastern part of the galaxy and includes the largest and densest hi cloud , a molecular cloud seen in co lines , a conspicuous dust lane , and a complex of large emission nebulae , reaching 300400  pc in size , with two shell nebulae hl111 and hl106 ( according to the catalog of hodge & lee  @xcite ) , as well as young star clusters and about a dozen wr stars ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",

    "the shell nebula hl106 is located in the densest southern part of a complex , consisting of hi , co , and dust clouds mentioned above .",
    "the ionizing radiation in this region must be generated by wr stars r2 and r10 and clusters 4 - 3 and 4 - 4 from the list of hunter  @xcite . according to the above author ,",

    "lozinskaya & moiseev  @xcite for the first time explained the formation of this synchrotron supershell by a hypernova explosion .",
    "the above features of ic  10 offer great possibilities for the study of the structure and physical characteristics of the dust component of a dwarf galaxy and the role that shocks play in its evolution . in this paper",
    "we analyze the connection between our data on ic  10 , obtained earlier , and observations of this galaxy with the spitzer telescope . in the following sections we describe the technique used to analyze these observations , present the obtained results and discuss them . in conclusions we summarize the main findings of this work .",
    "in this paper we use spitzer archive observations of ic  10 obtained as a part of the program `` a mid - ir hubble atlas of galaxies '' @xcite .",
    "these data were downloaded from the spitzer heritage archive .",
    "the mopex software was utilized to compose image mosaics and custom idl procedures were used to analyze them .",
    "one of the most complicated issues in the analysis of such images is the choice of the background level .",
    "sandstrom et al .",
    "@xcite used a rather sophisticated procedure for this purpose , because the small magellanic cloud occupies a large area on the sky .",
    "the angular size of ic  10 is small and one may therefore expect that background ( mostly intragalactic and zodiacal ) variations are small toward this galaxy . in this paper",
    "we set the background level in all the ir bands considered to the average brightness in areas located far from the star forming regions in ic  10 .",
    "the adopted background values are listed table  [ bkgr ] .",
    "such a simple procedure for background estimation is acceptable for our purposes .",
    "it is interesting that background values estimated using spot ( spitzer planning observations tool ) , which are also shown in table  [ bkgr ] ( these are values written in fits file headers ) , in some cases differ appreciably from the adopted values .",

    "the interest to near - ir observations of galaxies is related to the fact that uv - excited pah bands can be used as an indicator of the number of hot stars and hence as an indirect indicator of the star formation rate .",
    "draine & li  @xcite proposed to parameterize the uv radiation field of the galaxy as the sum of the `` minimum '' diffuse uv field @xmath9 ( the lower cutoff of the starlight intensity distribution ) , filling up most of the galaxy s volume , and a more intense uv field with a power - law distribution , which illuminates only the mass fraction @xmath10 of all the dust in the galaxy .",
    "the @xmath9 quantity , expressed in units of the average uv radiation field in our galaxy , characterizes the overall rate of star formation in the system studied , whereas @xmath10 allows one to estimate the mass fraction of the galaxy involved in the ongoing star formation .",

    "we then averaged the data of ir observations over the region of ic  10 , covered by 160  @xmath11 m data , and inferred the following parameters for this region : @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",

    "therefore , generally speaking , the above - mentioned low @xmath34-ratio `` semi - ring '' located near hl111 and hl106 might have formed due to the destructive effect not only from the uv radiation of the wr stars located within it , but also from shocks produced by winds of these stars .",

    "in particular , such features were found in the vicinity of two wr stars located in the `` semi - ring '' mentioned above .",
    "we reanalyzed the results of observations of the galaxy in both lines made with the fabry ",
    "perot interferometer at the 6-m telescope of the special astrophyscial observatory of the russian academy of sciences in order to reveal possible anticorrelation between high - velocity gas motions and @xmath4 .",
    "we computed h@xmath0 and [ sii]@xmath7  line profiles for several regions of high and low @xmath34 ratio .",
    "weak high - velocity features at a level of about 26% of the peak intensity are found in wings of both lines , and this coincidence confirms the reality of corresponding motions",
    ". however , these high - velocity features show up both in regions with high and low @xmath34 ratios .",
    "to obtain more definitive results , we mapped the distributions of velocities and intensities of high - velocity features in blue and red wings of h@xmath0 line in the entire available field of the galaxy and in the central star forming region .",
    "the resulting maps indicate that high - velocity features in blue and red wings of the line show up in ranges from 5060 to 100110 km / s and 50 to 100 km / s , respectively , relative to the velocity of the line peak .    in figure  [ hivel ]",
    "we compare the @xmath34 flux ratio to the intensities of high - velocity features in blue ( left panel ) and red ( right panel ) wings of h@xmath0 line .",
    "if the pah abundance depends on the presence of shocks , one would expect the intensity of high - velocity features to anticorrelate with @xmath34 .",
    "no such anticorrelation can be seen in the figure , albeit a certain pattern does emerge : higher intensities of high - velocity features in both the blue and red wings tend to `` avoid '' regions with the highest @xmath34 ratios , although they are observed in nearby , slightly offset , locations .",

    "this result indicates that the metallicity dependence of the pah abundance shows up not only globally ( at the level of entire galaxies ) , but also locally ( at least at the level of individual hii regions ) .    as we pointed out in the introduction , the only important difference between the two nearest irr galaxies ic  10 and smc is that in ic  10 we observe the interstellar medium immediately after a violent burst of star formation that has encompassed most of the galaxy .",

    "in the introduction we have already emphasized the importance of understanding the evolution of pahs and their relation to other galaxy components . in this work",
    "we compare results of infrared observations of ic  10 with other available observations in order to identify possible indications to the origin of pah .",
    "one of the key pah properties to be explained by their evolutionary model is the low content of these particles in metal - poor galaxies .",
    "two hypotheses are mainly discussed in the literature  less efficient formation and more efficient destruction of pahs in metal - poor systems .",
    "galliano et al .",
    "@xcite argue that the dependence of @xmath4 on the metallicity of a host galaxy can be naturally explained if we assume that pah particles are synthesized in the atmospheres of long - lived agb stars . in this case",
    "low metal and pah abundances are due to the slower stellar evolution . however ,",
    "if this assumption were true , the pah fraction @xmath4 in the ic  10 galaxy would be , first , low , and second , uniformly distributed throughout the galaxy .",
    "we show the pattern to be exactly the opposite  @xmath4 ( given by the @xmath34 flux ratio ) varies appreciably across the galaxy and amounts almost to 4% in some areas .    from the viewpoint of the spatial localization ,",
    "pahs correlate with both dense - gas indicators studied ( hi and co clouds ) .",
    "the pah mass fraction decreases only in the neighborhood of hii regions and wr stars , which is consistent with the hypothesis that these particles are destroyed by uv radiation and shocks ( although we failed to find convincing evidence for pah destruction by shocks ) . on the whole ,",
    "the pattern observed in ic  10 is qualitatively consistent with the assumption that pah particles in molecular clouds form _ in situ_. in this case the current high @xmath4 value in ic  10 may be related to a recent burst of star formation during which pah particles have formed in dense gas , and did not have enough time to be destroyed anywhere except for the immediate neighborhood of the uv radiation sources .",
    "if this interpretation is correct , the metallicity dependence of @xmath4 should show up until pah particles begin to be destroyed by ultraviolet radiation , and reflects the peculiarities of their formation rather than their subsequent evolution .",
    "we further plan to verify our conclusions by analyzing observational results on other dwarf galaxies .",
