    "galaxies at @xmath1 exhibit very diverse properties : they range from the blue lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) which are bright in the rest - frame ultraviolet ( steidel et al 1996a , b ) to the distant red galaxies ( drgs ) which are generally faint in the rest - frame uv and have fairly red rest - frame optical colors .",
    "the drgs are selected in the observers near - infrared ( nir ) by the simple criterion @xmath17 ( franx et al .",
    "2003 , van dokkum et al .",
    "the variety in the galaxy population at @xmath1 is comparable to that seen in the local universe , where colors range from very blue for young starbursting galaxies to very red for old elliptical galaxies .",
    "an urgent question is what causes the red colors of drgs at @xmath1 .",
    "are they `` old and dead '' , or are they actively star forming and more dusty than u - dropout galaxies ?    first analyses of the optical - to - nir spectral energy distributions ( seds ) and spectra have suggested that both effects play a role : they have higher ages , contain more dust , and have higher mass - to - light ( @xmath18 ) ratios in the rest - frame optical than lbgs ( franx et al .",
    "2003 , van dokkum et al .",
    "2004 , forster schreiber et al . 2004 ; f04 ) .",
    "furthermore , many have high star formation rates @xmath19yr@xmath20 ( van dokkum et al .",
    "2004 , f04 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the number of drgs with rest - frame optical spectroscopy is very small .",
    "inferences inevitably depend on sed fitting , which has large uncertainties ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the sed constraints on the stellar and dust content are expected to improve significantly by extending the photometry to the rest - frame near - infrared .    here",
    "we present the first results on rest - frame nir photometry of drgs and lbgs in the hubble deep field south ( hdfs ) as observed with the infrared array camera ( irac ; fazio et al .",
    "2004 ) on the _ spitzer space telescope_. where necessary , we assume an @xmath21 cosmology with @xmath22  km  s@xmath20mpc@xmath20 , and a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) between 0.1 and @xmath23 .",
    "magnitudes are expressed in the ab photometric system unless explicitly stated otherwise .",
    "we have observed the 5 arcmin@xmath24 hdfs / wfpc2 field with the irac camera integrating 1 hour each in the mid - infrared ( mir ) 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8@xmath25m@xmath16bands .",
    "the observations , data reduction , and photometry will be described by labb et al .",
    "( in preparation ) . briefly",
    ", we reduced and calibrated the data using standard procedures ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the limiting depths at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8@xmath25 m are 25.0 , 24.6 , 22.6 , and 22.5 mag , respectively ( 5@xmath26 , 3@xmath27 diameter aperture ) .",
    "we psf - matched the irac images and a very deep @xmath28image ( labb et al .",
    "2003 ) to the @xmath4m@xmath16band .",
    "nearby sources were fitted and subtracted to avoid confusion ( see labb et al .",
    "we measured fluxes in @xmath29 diameter apertures .",
    "the @xmath30 colors were then combined with the hdfs - catalog of labb et al .",
    "( 2003 ) resulting in 11-band photometry from 0.3 to 8@xmath25 m .",
    "in addition to the photometric errors , we add in quadrature an error of 10% to reflect absolute calibration uncertainties of irac .",
    "we selected drgs in the field of the hdfs using the criteria of @xcite yielding 14 galaxies with photometric redshifts ( rudnick et al .",
    "2003 ) in the range @xmath31 .",
    "one blended source was excluded .",
    "in addition , we selected isolated lbgs in the same field to the same @xmath32-band limit and in the same redshift range , using the u - dropout criteria of @xcite on the wfpc2 imaging @xcite .",
    "the two samples are complementary , with only 1 source in common . for both samples , the mean",
    "redshift is @xmath33 with a standard deviation of 0.5 ( f04 , wuyts et al . in preparation ) .",
    "the estimate is based on direct comparison of 16 galaxies with both photometric and spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "uncertainties in rest - frame magnitudes and model parameters are based on monte carlo simulations that take into account uncertainties in the observed fluxes and redshift estimates . ] .",
    "in fig .  [ fig.a ] we analyze the @xmath5 versus the @xmath6 m colors .",
    "the @xmath34 m color has a sufficiently large baseline and much higher signal - to - noise ratio than the @xmath35 m or @xmath36 m colors .",
    "the drgs and lbgs lie in very different regions , with little overlap .",
    "the mean @xmath34 m color of the drgs is significantly redder than that of lbgs , confirming that drgs have higher @xmath18 ratios in the rest - frame optical .",
    "the red @xmath5 and @xmath34 m colors of the drgs imply that they must be prominent in irac selected samples . indeed , the majority of red @xmath37 m sources selected by yan et al .",
    "( 2004 ) in the goods survey satisfy the drg selection criteria .",
    "we show color tracks for stellar population models ( bruzual & charlot 2003 ; bc03 ) , redshifted to a fixed @xmath33 : a single - age burst model ( ssp ) and two models with constant star formation ( csf ) , and reddenings typical for lbgs ( @xmath38 , shapley et al 2001 ) , and typical for drgs ( @xmath39 , f04 ) . the @xmath6 m colors of lbgs are consistent with low reddening models , whereas most of the drgs lie in the area of models with substantial extinction .",
    "three of 13 drgs ( indicated by star symbols in fig .",
    "1 ) lie well outside the area of constant star - forming models .",
    "their @xmath5 colors are too red for their @xmath34 m color and they lie close to the line of an old single - age burst model with ages of @xmath40 gyr . the candidate old",
    ", passive galaxies are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.b ] .",
    "their seds are very well fit by an old single burst population .",
    "the gray model curves are predictions based on fits to the exceptionally deep optical / nir data only , demonstrating that the spitzer fluxes lie very close to the expected values .",
    "dead galaxies have blue @xmath34 m colors and with spitzer we can now effectively separate them from dusty star - forming drgs , which are red in @xmath34 m .",
    "models with ongoing star - formation and dust - reddening fit the seds badly .",
    "star - formation histories ( sfhs ) with exponentially declining star - formation rates ( sfrs ) and timescales @xmath41 myr can be ruled out at the 99.9% confidence level .",
    "for the marginally acceptable models , the ratio of on - going to past - average sfr is @xmath42 indicating that these 3 galaxies are truly `` red and dead '' .",
    "the best - fit ages and implied formation redshifts depend on the assumed metallicity @xmath43 , as expected .",
    "super - solar @xmath44 models give a mean age of @xmath45  gyr and mean formation redshift @xmath46 , solar @xmath47 models yield @xmath48 gyr and @xmath49 , while sub - solar metallicity models fail to provide good fits to the irac fluxes as they are too blue .",
    "hence we infer from the models that the `` dead '' galaxies had formed most of their stellar mass by @xmath50 ( @xmath44 ) or much earlier @xmath51 ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "the number density of `` dead '' galaxies is 1.9 @xmath52  mpc@xmath53 , assuming a top hat redshift distribution between @xmath54 and 3 . for stellar masses",
    "@xmath55 and the same imf , that number density is @xmath56 lower than that of early - type galaxies in the nearby universe ( bell et al .",
    "2003 ) . obviously , the sampled volume is too small to allow firm conclusions , but the result is indicative of strong evolution of passive galaxies from @xmath57 to @xmath58 .      in fig .",
    "[ fig.b ] we show the seds for 3 of the 8 drgs whose optical / nir fluxes were better fit with csf models and reddening by a calzetti et al .",
    "( 2000 ) dust law .",
    "the observed mir flux points are often different from predictions based on shorter wavelengths , especially where the flux density @xmath59 was still rising at the observed @xmath28band .",
    "hence , for the very dusty drgs ( @xmath60 ) the mir fluxes help to better constrain the age and dust in the models . the average ages and extinction of the fits changed mildly after inclusion of the irac data : from @xmath611.1 to 1.3 gyr , and @xmath621.9 to 1.5 mag , respectively .",
    "finally , two remaining galaxies could not be fit well by any model , most likely due to emission line contamination .",
    "one of them is spectroscopically confirmed as a very strong lyman-@xmath63 emitter ( wuyts et al . in preparation ) .",
    "however , the generally good fits to the uv - to-8@xmath25 m seds of the drgs indicate that the red @xmath64 colors were caused by old age and dust - reddened star light , and not other anomalies .",
    "we note that one of the dead galaxies ( see fig .",
    "1 ) has an apparent flux excess at @xmath4 m , suggesting the presence of an obscured agn which starts to dominate the flux in the rest - frame @xmath14band ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we next study the @xmath18 ratios inferred from the sed fits described above , adopting the best fitting sfh ( ssp or csf ) .",
    "figure 3a shows the modeled @xmath15 ( rest - frame @xmath13 ) versus rest - frame @xmath65 .",
    "the curves show the dust - free bc03 model @xmath15 ratios .",
    "galaxies generally lie to the red of the model curves as a result of dust attenuation .",
    "the fits imply a large range in @xmath15 for drgs and lbgs together ( a factor of 6 ) .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath15 ratio correlates with rest - frame @xmath65 color , where galaxies red in the rest - frame optical have higher @xmath15 ratios than blue galaxies .",
    "the average @xmath15 of the drgs is @xmath66 , about three times higher than that of the lbgs .",
    "figure 3b shows the derived @xmath15 against the derived age .",
    "the @xmath15 correlates well with the age , as expected from the models .",
    "the role of extinction is greatly reduced in the rest - frame @xmath14band , implying that the differences in the @xmath15 ratios for drgs and lbgs are driven by age differences .",
    "figure 3c shows the @xmath15 ratio against stellar mass @xmath67 .",
    "drgs dominate the high - mass end .",
    "the highest - mass galaxies ( @xmath55 ) in this sample all have high @xmath15 ratios , and here the @xmath15 ratio does not depend strongly on @xmath67 . at lower masses galaxies have much lower @xmath15 ratios .",
    "this may be a selection effect caused by our magnitude cut - off , as we would miss low - mass galaxies with high @xmath15 .",
    "however , high - mass galaxies with _ low _ @xmath15 would be detected if they existed , hence the lower envelope of the @xmath15 versus @xmath67 distribution is real .",
    "two intriguing possibilities are that the mean @xmath15 decreases towards lower stellar mass , or that the intrinsic scatter in @xmath15 increases .",
    "our drgs and lbgs were selected in the observed @xmath28band ( rest - frame @xmath68band ) .",
    "we find a large variation in @xmath69 ( a factor of 25 ) , hence selection effects play a major role in nir studies at high redshift .",
    "selection using mir observations with spitzer would improve the situation , but the wide range in @xmath15 ratios and ages found here indicates that even a irac @xmath4m@xmath16selected sample would still be very different from a mass - selected sample .",
    "we have presented rest - frame uv - to - nir photometry of a sample of drgs and lbgs at @xmath3 in the hdfs .",
    "these galaxies span a wide range in properties , similar to low - redshift galaxies .",
    "the rest - frame nir photometry from irac helps significantly : first , by allowing us to separate `` old and dead '' from dusty star forming drgs using only the observed @xmath70 , and @xmath71m - band , and second , by improving model constraints on the heavily obscured drgs .",
    "the wide range in galaxy properties at @xmath57 raises several important issues .",
    "first , it demonstrates it is impossible to obtain mass - selected samples photometrically . even in the rest - frame @xmath13-band",
    ", the @xmath18 ratio varies by a factor of 6 for the drgs and lbgs in the hdfs .",
    "second , we need to understand what produces these variations . if a relation between total stellar mass and @xmath15 exists ( see fig .",
    "3c ) then stellar mass might be driving the variations .",
    "deeper irac data is needed to establish this well , as incompleteness effects may play a role .",
    "it is tantalizing that kauffmann et al .",
    "( 2003 ) find a similar correlation at @xmath72 , with the most massive galaxies being the oldest and having the highest @xmath18 ratios .",
    "the authors also found that above a stellar mass @xmath73 galaxy properties correlate only weakly with @xmath67 , similar to what we find at @xmath3 .",
    "the simplest explanation is that we observe the same galaxies at @xmath72 and @xmath57 , although we note that hierarchical formation scenarios predict significant merging for galaxies at @xmath1 .",
    "alternatively , we observe merging processes occurring at a critical mass of about @xmath74 .",
    "a partial explanation may be a simple relation between mass and metallicity : higher mass galaxies might have higher metallicity , and thus be redder .",
    "it is very noteworthy that there are `` red and dead '' galaxies at @xmath3 .",
    "previous authors found such galaxies at @xmath75 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "whereas the number density of `` dead '' galaxies at @xmath57 is probably much lower than at @xmath58 , the mere existence of these systems at such high redshift raises the question what caused such a rapid and early decline in star formation .",
    "our model fits imply that their star formation stopped by @xmath76 or higher , close to or during the epoch of reionization .",
    "possibly a strong feedback mechanism caused this , such as an agn or galactic - scale outflow .",
    "we note that these galaxies are among the most massive galaxies at @xmath57 , and hence were probably at the extreme tail of the mass function at @xmath76 .",
    "obviously , many questions remain unanswered by this study .",
    "only a very small field has been studied , and similar studies on wider fields are necessary .",
    "finally , the @xmath18 ratios derived here remain model dependent and vary with the assumed sfh , metallicity , and imf ( e.g. , bell et al .",
    "direct mass determinations are presently very challenging , but are becoming more important to understand the @xmath3 galaxy population .",
