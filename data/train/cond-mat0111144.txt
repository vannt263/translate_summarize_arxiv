    "due to its fundamentally quantum nature , electron spin has very limited choice of interactions through which it can couple to the environment .",
    "thus , its polarization can survive various forces in metals or semiconductors , while charge carriers undergo many scattering events , for long enough time to allow for envisioned quantum technologies that manipulate spin , such as spintronics  @xcite or solid - state quantum computing with spin - qubits .",
    "@xcite spintronic engineering of spin - polarized currents , combined with conventional electronics that manipulate electron charge , offers an exciting prospect to assemble information processing , storage , and communication on the same chip .",
    "recent experimental advances have provided an impetus to study spin - polarized transport in two - dimensional electron systems , posing theoretical challenges  @xcite where the ubiquitous `` factor of two '' for spin degeneracy in usual transport formulas has to be replaced by a more involved analysis of the interplay between orbital and spin degrees of freedom of the electrons .",
    "while quantum - coherence of spin is essential for spintronic qubits , as well as some of the proposed spintronic devices for classical information processing ,  @xcite modeling of the orbital kinetics of electrons that carry spin has mostly followed the traditional route of device engineering in charge - electronics : the charge transport ( ballistic or diffusive ) is described by a semiclassical boltzmann formalism treating electrons and holes as classical particles where quantum effects enter only through their kinetic energy ( being determined by the semiconductor band structure ) .",
    "@xcite although many applications require devices operating at room temperature ( where phase - coherence of orbital degrees of freedom is usually washed out ) , from the fundamental transport physics point of view , it is intriguing to explore quantum interference effects involving both the charge and spin of the electrons in nanoscale samples at very low temperatures @xmath2k  a playground of mesoscopic physics over the past two decades .",
    "@xcite moreover , better understanding of the role of conserved quantum coherence of both wave functions and spin states in the conductions process is crucial for the devices that involve spin - polarized resonant tunneling .",
    "@xcite recent theoretical efforts have been exploring mesoscopic aspects of spintronics by extending standard techniques ( such as , the landauer - b \" uttiker scattering approach to quantum transport of _ spinless _ particles in finite - size systems  @xcite ) to describe transport in the presence of spin - dependent interactions by taking into account quantum - coherent dynamics of both orbital and spin degrees of freedom .",
    "@xcite even though it is possible to add local spin - dependent effects into the scattering matrix directly , such extensions become highly non - trivial in the most general case where spin effects occur all over the system , as in the presence of so interactions .",
    "@xcite    a particularly important interaction for semiconductor spintronics is the rashba type of spin - orbit coupling ,  @xcite which is different from the more familiar impurity induced and position dependent one in metals .",
    "@xcite it arises from the asymmetry along the @xmath3-axis of the confining quantum well electric potential ( generating a magnetic field in the electron rest frame ) that creates a two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron gas ( @xmath4-plane ) on a narrow - gap semiconductor surface . since the rashba coupling can be tuned by an external gate electrode ,  @xcite it is envisaged as a tool to control the precession of the electron spin in the datta - das proposal for a field - effect spin transistor .",

    "the successful realization of such devices demands resolution of some of the paramount fundamental problems in current spintronic research : all - electrical injection , at _ room temperature _ , of fully spin - polarized currents into a semiconductor  @xcite ( on the same footing as demonstrated in metallic devices  @xcite where large currents of cold - electrons can be injected and detected via ohmic contacts ) ; efficient spin detection at a drain electrode ( spin measurement is impeded by the same feature that generates long coherence times making it technologically interesting ",

    "these intuitive notions are then rigorously elaborated within the tensor product formalism for the joint description of spin and orbital quantum states , thereby making it easy to include effects of quantum coherence in the computation of transport quantities relevant for spintronics .",
    "the central such quantity is the conductance matrix @xmath1 describing spin - resolved transport measurements .",
    "we then introduces an efficient technique to compute @xmath1 by developing an implementation ( based on lattice green functions  @xcite formulated in the tensor product of real and spin space , rather than wave functions ) of the landauer - b \" uttiker formulation of linear response transport .",

    "this allows us to sweep through different transport regimes : from ballistic ( where few scattering events take place within the sample of size @xmath7 since mean free path satisfies @xmath8 ) to strongly disordered ( where mean free path loses its meaning ) .",
    "recent quantum - coherent treatments of spin - polarized transport in two - terminal devices have been confined to clean samples  @xcite because the datta - das original spin - fet proposal ( which has ignited much of the interest for semiconductor spintronics ) requires strictly ballistic transport regime for the charge degrees of freedom . however , some level of scattering ( from impurities , boundaries , or at the fm - sm interface ) is inevitable , and it is important to understand properties of spin - polarized injection , conduction , and degradation of well - defined spin - polarization in such environment .",
    "@xcite for example , peculiar quantum interference effects , arising from the entanglement of spin and orbital degrees of freedom ,  @xcite are revealed in our disordered fm - sm - fm system when analyzing the relationship between partial conductances ( elements of @xmath1 ) as a function of the rashba so coupling , disorder strength , and orientation of incoming electron spin with respect to the rashba electric field ( sec .",

    "in the general formalism of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics , spin degrees of freedom are internal , and are therefore described within a separate finite - dimensional vector space @xmath9 which has to be multiplied tensorially with an orbital space @xmath10 to get the _ full _ hilbert space of quantum states @xmath11 .",
    "any operator acting in @xmath12 can be expressed as a linear combination of the tensor products @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 act in @xmath16 and @xmath9 , respectively . a generic hamiltonian model for spintronics",

    "the advantage of spintronics modeling through a quantum transport formalism that takes as an input a microscopic single - particle hamiltonian is that spin , as a genuine quantum attribute of an electron , is treated in the most natural way by an operator acting in a two - dimensional vector space @xmath9 .",
    "the spin - dependent interactions are then accounted for by the terms in a hamiltonian that are functions of the spin operator @xmath22 [ @xmath23 is a vector of the pauli spin matrices ] acting in @xmath9 .",
    "an arbitrary state vector @xmath24 is a linear combination of the separable ( i.e. , uncorrelated ) states forming a basis @xmath25 , where @xmath26 are basis states in @xmath16 and corresponding basis state @xmath27 in @xmath28 are the spin eigenstates @xmath27 of @xmath29 ( @xmath30 is a quantum number labeling the two eigenstates , and @xmath31 is a unit vector along the spin - quantization axis which is taken to be parallel to the magnetization of the ferromagnetic contacts in fm - sm - fm geometry ) .    most of quantum - interference phenomena observed in standard mesoscopic experiments ( such as , weak localization , conductance fluctuations , or the aharonov - bohm effects  @xcite ) probe the _ orbital _ quantum coherence of electron states , which requires preservation of the relative phase of linear superpositions of spatial states of the electron .",
    "@xcite such mesoscopic systems are smaller than the dephasing length @xmath32 ( typically @xmath33 @xmath34 m at low enough temperatures @xmath35 ) set by inelastic processes .",
    "thus , coherence times relevant for these investigations are completely disconnected from the spin coherence times @xmath36 over which the relative phase in superpositions of @xmath5 and @xmath6 spin states is well - defined  @xcite ( transport of phase - coherent spin states has been observed  @xcite over length scale @xmath37 @xmath34 m in semiconductors at low temperatures where @xmath36 can reach 100 ns ) . for an ensemble of spins created in experiments  @xcite , the operational loss of phase coherence",
    "is described by the dephasing time @xmath38 due to inhomogeneities in the zeeman terms ( although such dephasing is independent of individual spin decoherence , it provides experimentally measurable lower bound @xmath39 ) . the other basic time scale which , together with @xmath36 , captures essential features of spin dynamics is the spin relaxation time @xmath40 ( typically @xmath41 ) .",
    "the time @xmath40 is classical in nature since it determines lifetime of an excited spin state ( aligned long the external magnetic field ) , i.e. , the relaxation of unbalanced populations of spin states toward thermal equilibrium so that no concept of superpositions of quantum states is involved .",
    "@xcite corresponding spin diffusion length @xmath42 sets the upper limit to the size for any spintronic device since beyond this scale spin - encoded information completely fades away .",
    "@xcite the principal interactions providing modes of decoherence and spin relaxation are exchange coupling with other electron ( or nuclear ) spins and so coupling to impurity atoms and defects . in spintronic systems of current interest , one can encounter quantum interference effects stemming from spin coherence  @xcite , both spin and orbital coherence that are independent of each other ,  @xcite or intertwined spin and orbital coherence when so interaction are strong .",
    "@xcite    these different quantum - coherent situations become transparent after being recast in the formalism of tensor products of hilbert spaces and corresponding operators . in conventional",
    "_ macroscopic _ solids at finite temperatures one has to use a quantum statistical mechanics description of electrons in terms of density operators  @xcite ( i.e. , density matrices when a particular representation is chosen ) @xmath43 which are determined by thermal equilibrium .",
    "the most general quantum state of a spin@xmath44 particle is accounted for by a density operator  @xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46 .",
    "for example , @xmath47 describes a pure quantum state which is fully _ polarized _ in the direction of vector @xmath48 , while @xmath49 stands for a non - pure state ( the so - called _ mixture _ ) that is completely unpolarized .",
    "the trivial example is injection of both spin states in equal proportion , @xmath50 .",
    "coupling of electron spin to the environment of surrounding electronic or nuclear spins causes decoherence of spin quantum state , i.e. , appearance of mixtures @xmath51 of spin states instead of a single pure state . in semiclassical spintronics ,",
    "the spin part of the full ( non - pure ) state becomes a pure state @xmath52 .",
    "then , after taking only diagonal elements of @xmath53 , a semiclassical description in terms of the boltzmann distribution functions for @xmath5 and @xmath6 electrons is obtained where phase - relations between different states are ignored  @xcite ( as applicable to systems with @xmath54 ) . saying that the sample is _ phase - coherent _ in standard _ mesoscopic _",
    "physics has a simple meaning in the formal language : an electron is described throughout the sample by a single wave function @xmath55 , i.e. , the orbital factor gets `` purified '' @xmath56 at low enough temperatures where dephasing processes are suppressed below @xmath34 m scales ( while in usual experiments with unpolarized currents the spin factor is @xmath57 ) . in sample with both orbital and spin quantum coherence ,",
    "the full state is pure @xmath58 , such as @xmath59 the separability of the full state in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pure ] ) holds only when scattering events are spin - independent ( such as those generated by lattice imperfections , phonons , and non - magnetic impurities ) , thereby leaving the spin state of a traversing electron unchanged . in this case , the orbital and spin factor states evolve independently in a coherent fashion within its own factor subspaces @xmath9 or @xmath16 , under the unitary operator generated by the corresponding hamiltonian .",
    "however , in the presence of spin - orbit interaction , these two quantum - coherences become intertwined ( note that if reduced density operator , obtained by tracing over the states in the other factor spaces , is pure , than it must be a factor of the total state operator  @xcite ) . for example , if separable state with @xmath60 spin factor is injected into a device with spin - orbit coupling , it will evolve by unitary quantum evolution into a linear superposition @xmath61 of the separable state vectors @xmath62 of some basis in @xmath12 .",
    "such superpositions are still _ pure _ , albeit non - separable quantum states , i.e. , the different degrees of freedom ( orbital and spin ) of one and the the same particle have become _",
    "entangled_.  @xcite thus , in this case individual spin or orbital states lose their coherence since they are not pure any more ( although no real ensemble of different quantum states corresponding to such mixtures exists in the sample ,  @xcite contrary to the case in the example of mixed spin states given above ) .",
    "this is analogous to the general decoherence mechanism that operates by entangling quantum system to its environment .",
    "@xcite it also explains the formal meaning of ` spin - orbit quantum interference effects ' ,  @xcite since entanglement is entailed by linear superpositions of states in the full hilbert space @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , such entangled states display quantum - mechanical non - locality , usually studied in the context of entanglement of two particles ( e.g. , einstein - podolsky - rosen or bell states  @xcite ) , which manifests here as `` wholistic '' spin effects all throughout the system .",
    "@xcite when both @xmath5 and @xmath6 particles are injected , the state of an electron is a statistical superposition @xmath63 , rather than the coherent one @xmath64 .",
    "thus , the quest for spintronic devices that would utilize quantum - coherent dynamics of all degrees of freedom requires to master the control of spins without destroying the phase coherence of orbital degrees of freedom  @xcite ( as is the case when many - body interactions with surrounding nuclear spins or other electrons  @xcite are involved ) , and _ vice versa_.",
    "@xcite    the effects of quantum - coherence on electronic transport are most easily discussed within the landauer - b \" uttiker scattering approach . to study spin - polarized quantum transport , the basis of asymptotic scattering states at the fermi energy @xmath65 in the leads",
    "should be comprised of the following vectors @xmath66 in the spinless case , the orbital factors are usually referred to as conducting ` channels '  @xcite ; here a ` spin - polarized channel ' @xmath67 has a real wave number @xmath68 , a transverse wave function @xmath69 defined by quantization of transverse momentum in the leads of finite cross section and given boundary conditions , and a spin factor state @xmath60 or @xmath70 .",
    "thus , injecting a flux concentrated in the channel @xmath71 will generate the following quantum state in the opposite lead @xmath72 in the most general situation , with spin - dependent charge scattering present in the central region , this state is coherent mixture of all spin - polarized channels  ( [ eq : channel ] ) .",
    "this equation introduces a transmission matrix @xmath73 , whose elements are @xmath74",
    ". the @xmath73-matrix accounts for the unitary transformation that the central region would perform on the incoming electronic wave function from the left lead .",
    "the formalism we introduce here is capable of dealing with all of the variety of quantum - coherent situations relevant for transport ( i.e. , coherent superpositions of scattering quantum states in @xmath16 , @xmath9 , or @xmath75 ) in arbitrary geometry , and for arbitrary values of interaction strengths , as long as one stays withing the domain of single - particle picture .",
    "we choose the anderson model for @xmath76 ( which is often used for numerical modeling of quantum transport ,  @xcite localization - delocalization transition ,  @xcite and brute force computation of conductance fluctuations ,  @xcite ) @xmath77 on a square @xmath78 lattice ( @xmath79 , with @xmath80 being the lattice spacing ) . here",

    "the _ local orbital basis _ is advantageous since it allows one to treat an _",
    "arbitrary _ measurement geometry , which is an essential ingredient in the studies of quantum transport through finite - size mesoscopic systems .",
    "@xcite in the applied magnetic field , the link fields @xmath86 entering the peierls phase factor introduce aharonov - bohm phases into the tight - binding model so that the flux through a given loop @xmath87 is @xmath88 in units of the flux quantum @xmath89 .",
    "the disorder is simulated by taking a random on - site potential with @xmath90 being uniformly distributed over the interval @xmath91 $ ] [ the other possibilities to introduce disorder is random hopping , @xmath92 $ ] , or random fluxes @xmath93 .",
    "the lattice site states of @xmath76 multiplied tensorially by @xmath27 define a basis @xmath94 in @xmath95 , and therefore a real@xmath0spin - space representation of the operators in our algorithm .",
    "the purely spin part of @xmath96 is exemplified by a zeeman term @xmath97 where @xmath98 ( @xmath99 is an effective gyromagnetic ratio and @xmath100 is the bohr magneton ) and @xmath101 is the applied magnetic field . finally , the relevant so couplings in 2d heterostructures  @xcite ( neglecting @xmath102 terms ) are given by the rashba term  @xcite @xmath103 ( @xmath104 is a unit vector orthogonal to the plane of the sample and @xmath105 is the effective mass ) , and the dresselhaus term  @xcite @xmath106 ( generated by the lack of inversion symmetry of a periodic crystal potential in the bulk , like in gaas ) : @xmath107 where we replace @xmath105 by its tight - binding description in terms of @xmath108 .",
    "the explicit use of the tensor - product notation in our formulas makes it possible to obtain quickly and efficiently their matrix representation in a chosen basis .",
    "for example , to obtain the site - spin representation of the rashba term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rashba ] ) we use the fact that velocity operator is a matrix @xmath109 in the site representation , and then multiply , in the sense of direct product of matrices ( when particular representation is chosen , @xmath0 stands for the kronecker or direct product of matrices ) , this matrix with respective pauli matrix .",
    "thus , the final matrix elements in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rashba ] ) are just dimensionless constants multiplied by the material - specific `` spin - orbit hopping parameters '' @xmath110 and @xmath111 that set the energy scales of the rashba and dresselhaus terms , respectively .",
    "the rashba term added to the tight - binding hamiltonian  ( [ eq : tbh ] ) will cause spin splitting [ i.e. , lifting of spin degeneracy for @xmath5 and @xmath6 states having the same momentum , @xmath112 of an energy subband of 2deg into two branches @xmath113 \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\pm 2t_{\\rm so}^{\\rm r}\\sqrt{\\sin^2(k_xa)+\\sin^2(k_ya ) } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for clean sample with constant @xmath114 on the diagonal [ the splitting becomes linear  @xcite in the momentum @xmath115 for parabolic subband dispersion @xmath116 characterizing continuous systems ] .",
    "such splitting of the conduction band as a result of spin - orbit coupling in the presence of an asymmetric confinement potential makes it a useful tool to model the electronic structure of confined narrow - gap semiconductors .",
    "rashba so term also induces , when viewed within the semiclassical picture , spin precession around effective rashba magnetic field @xmath117 [ rashba hamiltonian , like any so term , can be interpreted as the interaction of electron spin with @xmath118-dependent internal effective magnetic field , @xmath119 with frequency @xmath120 . in the presence of disorder",

    ". in the cases of our study where interplay of the rashba interaction and charge scattering takes place ( at zero temperature ) ,",
    "initial full polarization of injected electrons is destroyed ( technically , measurement of the spin - dependent properties alone requires to use reduced density operator , which does not describe a pure state any more ) .",
    "this is analogous to dyakonov - perel mechanism ,  @xcite which is usually discussed in the context of spin relaxation  @xcite , but in our study of transport through mesoscopic spintronics structures , which are effectively at zero - temperature , it is responsible for the spin decoherence .  @xcite      the central result of our formalism is a direct algorithm to compute exactly the zero - temperature conductance matrix  @xcite of a single sample @xmath122 we imagine that the 2d sample is attached via perfect ohmic contacts ( which are desirable but are currently problematic to achieve at fm - sm interface together with efficient injection  @xcite ) to two ideal semi - infinite leads ( fig .",

    "the leads also define , by transverse quantization , the orbital part of an asymptotic scattering state in eq .",
    "( [ eq : channel ] ) .",
    "moreover , they effectively remove `` hot '' electrons from the open sample , thereby bypassing the intricate issues of dissipation which must occur somewhere in the circuit to reach the steady - state regime under external pumping .",
    "while the trick of using ideal semi - infinite leads is a standard one in mesoscopic transport theory ,  @xcite the polarization of the asymptotic states stems from the different densities of states for @xmath5 and @xmath6 electrons in the ferromagnetic contacts ( which can be conventional metallic or semiconducting , currently available only at low temperature  @xcite ) .",
