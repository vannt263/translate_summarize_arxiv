    "nearly everyone has tried to throw a stone on a lake and count the number of bounces the stone was able to make .",
    "of course the more , the better.@xcite our intuition gives us some empirical rules for the best throw : the best stones are flat and rather circular ; one has to throw them rather fast and with a small angle with the water surface ; a small kick is given with a finger to give the stone a spin . of course these rules can be understood using the laws of physics : the crucial part of the motion is the collisional process of the stone with the water surface . the water surface exerts a reaction ( lift ) force on the stone , allowing it to rebound .",
    "this process is quite complex because it involves the description of the flow around the immersed stone.@xcite some energy is also dissipated during a collision , so that after a few rebounds , the initial kinetic energy of the stone is fully dissipated and the stone sinks .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to propose a simplified description of the bouncing process of a stone on water , in order to estimate the maximum number of bounces performed by the stone .",
    "this problem provides an entertaining exercise for undergraduate students , with simple explanations for empirical laws that almost everyone has experienced .",
    "consider a flat stone , with a small thickness and a mass @xmath0 .",
    "the stone is thrown over a flat water surface .",
    "the angle between the stone surface and the water plane is @xmath1 . a schematic view of the collisional process is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "the velocity @xmath2 is assumed to lie in a symmetry plane of the stone ( the plane of the paper ) .",
    "the difficult part of the problem is , of course , to model the reaction force due to the water , which results from the flow around the stone during the stone - water contact .",
    "it is not the aim of this paper to give a detailed description of the fluid flow around the colliding stone .",
    "rather i shall use a simplified description of the force keeping only the main ingredients of the problem .",
    "first , the velocity @xmath2 of the stone is expected to be ( at least initially ) the order of a few meters per second . for a stone with a characteristic size @xmath3 of the order of a few centimeters , the reynolds number , defined as @xmath4 , with @xmath5 the kinematic viscosity ( @xmath6 for water ) , is of order @xmath7 , that is , much larger than unity.@xcite in this ( inertial ) regime ,",
    "the force due to the water on the stone is expected on dimensional grounds to be quadratic in the velocity and proportional to the apparent surface of the moving object and the mass density of the fluid.@xcite because the stone is only partially immersed in water during the collisional process , we expect the force to be proportional to the immersed surface ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "the force can be adequately decomposed into a component along the direction of the stone ( that is , along @xmath8 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) and a component perpendicular to it ( that is , along @xmath9 ) .",
    "the latter corresponds to the lift component of the force , and the former corresponds to a friction component ( of water along the object ) .",
    "i write the reaction force due to water , @xmath10 , as : @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the lift and friction coefficients , @xmath14 is the mass density of water , @xmath15 is the area of the immersed surface , and @xmath9 is the unit vector normal to the stone ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1 ] ) .    note that in general , both @xmath12 and @xmath13 are functions of the tilt angle @xmath1 and incidence angle @xmath16 , defined as the angle between velocity @xmath2 and the horizontal . in the simplified analysis",
    "i will assume that both @xmath12 and @xmath13 are constant and independent of tilt and incidence angles.@xcite this assumption is not a strong one because ricochets are generally performed with a small tilt angle , @xmath1 , and a small incidence angle , @xmath16 .",
    "if one denotes the initial components of the incident velocity by @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( parallel and perpendicular to the water surface , respectively ) , the latter assumption amounts to @xmath19 .",
    "we expect the lift force to be maximum when the object is only partially immersed due to the lack of symmetry between the two sides of the stone",
    ". therefore , if the object reaches a depth such that it becomes completely immersed , the lift force would be greatly diminished and would probably not be able to sustain the weight of the stone anymore . for simplicity",
    ", i will assume that the lift force vanishes for completely immersed objects .",
    "the model for the force in eq .",
    "( [ force ] ) is crude , but it is expected to capture the main physical ingredients of the stone - water interaction . it might fail for lower stone velocities or larger incidence angles , where a bulge of water could be created and affect the lift and friction forces on the stone.@xcite however , in this case it is expected that the stone will be strongly destabilized during the collision process and perform only a very small number of bounces .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to large initial velocities and small incidence angles , such that the number of bounces is sufficiently large .",
    "consider the collisional process , that is , the time during which the stone is partially immersed in water .",
    "i will assume in this section that the incidence angle @xmath1 between the stone and the water surface is constant during the collisional process .",
    "the validity of this assumption is considered in detail in sec .",
    "the origin of time , @xmath20 , corresponds to the instant when the edge of the stone reaches the water surface . during the collisional process ,",
    "the equations of motion for the center of mass velocity are    [ eom ] @xmath21    with @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the acceleration due to gravity .",
    "note that in eq .",
    "( [ eom ] ) the area @xmath15 depends on the immersed depth and thus varies during the collisional process .    equation  ( [ eom ] ) is non - linear due to the @xmath24 terms on the right - hand side , but also due to the dependence of the immersed area , @xmath15 , on the height @xmath25 .",
    "however , we can propose a simple approximation scheme : the magnitude of the velocity , @xmath2 , is not expected to be strongly affected by the collision process ( as i shall show in sec .  [ bounces ] ) .",
    "i thus make the approximation that @xmath26 on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eom ] ) .",
    "the validity of this assumption requires a sufficiently high initial velocity , @xmath17 , and it might fail in the last few rebounds of a stone skip sequence .    with this approximation , eq .",
    "( [ comz ] ) decouples from eq .",
    "( [ comx ] ) .",
    "i thus first focus the discussion on the equation for the height @xmath25 , which is the height of the immersed edge ( see fig .  [",

    "let me introduce @xmath80 such that @xmath81 at @xmath82 : @xmath73 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath60 for @xmath83 .",
    "now it is easy to show that @xmath84 ( because @xmath85 and @xmath86 ) , and the condition @xmath87 is therefore equivalent to @xmath88 , that is , @xmath89 .",

    "i have so far described the rebound of the stone by analyzing its vertical motion .",
    "this analysis gave a minimum velocity for skimming which results from the balance between the weight of the stone and the lift of the force due to water .",

( [ deltav2 ] ) is @xmath107 now we have the simple relation @xmath108 , with @xmath109 ( see eq .",
    "( [ force ] ) ) .",
    "moreover , it is expected that the average vertical force during a collision , @xmath110 , is the order of the weight of the stone , @xmath56 .",
    "this point can be explicitly verified for the square stone case , using the expression of the force @xmath111 in terms of the height @xmath112 and eq .",
    "( [ sol_z ] ) .",
    "the final result is @xmath113.@xcite .",
    "moreover , as shown in the above ( and in particular for the square stone , although the results remain qualitatively valid for the circular one ) , the collision time is given approximatively by @xmath114 .",

    "we deduce that the initial velocity should be larger than the minimum velocity @xmath121 in order to perform at least one bounce , that is , @xmath122 if we use the same numerical values as in the previous paragraph , we obtain @xmath123 , @xmath124 cm , so that @xmath125ms@xmath54 .",
    "this criterion is more restrictive than the previous one , eq .",
    "( [ condition_vx_circle ] ) .",
    "i thus consider in the following that eq .",
    "( [ min_dissip ] ) is the criterion for the stone to skim over water .",
    "the previous calculations assumed a constant angle @xmath1 . it is obvious that the rebound of the stone is optimized when @xmath1 is small and positive ( see , for example , the value of the force constant @xmath126 which decreases when @xmath1 increases ) .",
    "now , if after a collision , the stone is put in rotation around the @xmath127-axis ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1 ] ) , that is , @xmath128 , its orientation would change by an appreciable amount during free flight : the incidence angle @xmath1 for the next collision has little chance to still be in a favorable situation .",
    "the stone performs , say , at most one or two more collisions .",
    "there is therefore a need for a stabilizing angular motion .",
    "this is the role of the spin of the stone .",
    "let us denote @xmath129 as the rotational velocity of the stone around the symmetry axis parallel to @xmath9 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "i neglect in the following any frictional torque on the stone ( associated with rotational motion ) . during the collision ,",
    "the reaction force due to the water is applied only to the immersed part of the stone and results in a torque applied on the stone . for simplicity ,",
    "i consider only the lift part of the force .",
    "its contribution to the torque ( calculated at the center @xmath130 of the stone ) can be readily calculated as @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is the unit vector in the @xmath127 direction in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] and @xmath133 , the point of application of the lift force , is located at the center of mass of the immersed area .",
    "this torque is in the @xmath127 direction and will eventually affect the angular motion along @xmath1 .",
    "however a spin motion around @xmath9 induces a stabilizing torque : this is the well - known gyroscopic effect.@xcite the derivation of the equation of motion of the rotating object ( the euler equations ) is a classic problem and is treated in standard mechanics textbooks ( see for example , ref .  ) . on the basis of these equations ,",
    "it is possible to derive the stabilizing gyroscopic effect .",
    "this derivation is briefly summarized in the appendix .    in our case",
    ", the equation for the angle @xmath1 can be written as @xmath134 where @xmath135\\dot \\phi_0 $ ] , @xmath136 is the initial spin angular velocity ( in the @xmath9 direction ) , and @xmath137 and @xmath138 are moments of inertia in the @xmath9 and @xmath8 directions , respectively ; @xmath139 is the initial tilt angle and @xmath140 is the projection of the torque due to the water flow in the @xmath127 direction .",
    "equation  ( [ momentum ] ) shows that in the absence of spin motion , @xmath141 , the torque due to the lift force will initiate rotational motion of the stone in the @xmath1 direction . as discussed above",
    ", the corresponding situation is unstable .",
    "on the other hand , spin motion induces a stabilizing torque that can maintain @xmath1 around its initial value .",
    "the effect of the torque can be neglected if , after a collision with the water , the maximum amplitude of the motion of the angle @xmath1 is small : @xmath142_{\\rm max } \\ll 1 $ ] .",
    "if we use eq .",

    "the order of magnitude of @xmath148 can be obtained using the results of sec .",
    "[ dissip ] .",
    "the average vertical force acting on the stone has been found to be the order of the weight of the stone ( see the discussion after eq .",

    "if we take @xmath150 , we obtain the simple result @xmath151 .",
    "the estimate for @xmath152 follows directly as @xmath153 .",

    "( [ spin_condition ] ) gives @xmath156s@xmath54 , corresponding to a rotational frequency larger than a few revolutions per second ( @xmath157hz ) .",
    "this condition is easily fullfilled in practice and corresponds approximately to what we would expect intuitively for a successful throw .",
    "note that the condition ( [ spin_condition ] ) is independent of the center of mass velocity of the stone @xmath2 .",
    "the estimation of the maximum number of bounces is the most difficult and tentative part of the analysis because many factors can in principle slow down or destabilize the stone , some of which are extremely difficult to model ( such as irregularities of the water surface and the wind ) .",
    "we shall assume the idealized situation described above ( perfect surface , no wind , idealized reaction force ) and focus on two specific factors , which appear , at least intuitively , as natural candidates for stopping the stone .      as i have discussed in sec .",
    "[ dissip ] , energy is dissipated during a collision and the @xmath100 component of the velocity of the stone will decrease during each collision : after a few collisions , all the initial kinetic energy will be dissipated .",

    "some of the results are also in agreement with observations , for example , the acceleration of the number of collisions at the end of the throw ( a phenomenon known as  pitty - pat \" in stone skipping competitions @xcite ) .",
    "some easy checks of the assumptions underlying our calculations could be performed , even without any sophisticated apparatus .",
    "for example , taking pictures of the water surface after the ricochets would locate the positions of the collisions ( because small waves are produced at the surface of water ) . a simple test of the variation of the distance between two collisions as a function of collision number , eq .",
    "( [ deltax ] ) , would then be possible .",
    "a more ambitious project would be to design a `` catapult , '' allowing one to throw stones with a controlled translational and spin velocity ( together with the incidence angle of the stone on water ) .",
    "a measurement of the maximum number of bounces performed for various throw parameters would allow us to check the assumptions underlying the present simple analysis and to determine some of the parameters involved in the description ( such as @xmath198 and @xmath116 ) .",
    "it would be also interesting to repeat the experiments reported in ref .",
    "using modern techniques ( such as fast cameras ) , in order to image and analyze in particular the rebound process as a function of the throw parameters .",
    "hopefully a better understanding of the mechanisms of stone skipping will allow someone to break the actual world record !",
    "i thank my son lonard for his ( numerous and always renewed ) perplexing questions .",
    "i thank my colleagues from the physics laboratory of the ens lyon , and in particular bernard castaing and thierry dauxois , for their constant interest in discussing ",
    "simple \" physics problems .",
    "i am grateful to the referee for pointing out refs .   and to me .",
    "i briefly recall the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ momentum ] ) , from the euler equations described in ref .",
    "the latter are written as:@xcite      in eq .",
    "( [ euler ] ) , @xmath200 , @xmath201 , and @xmath202 ( @xmath203 ) are respectively the moment of inertia , angular velocity , and torque along the direction of a particular principal axis , denoted as @xmath204 . in our case ,",
    "the direction 1 is taken along the axis perpendicular to the vectors @xmath9 and @xmath8 ( the direction 1 is along the @xmath127 axis in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1 ] ) , the direction 2 along @xmath9 and the direction 3 along @xmath8 .",
    "we therefore have @xmath205 , and due to the symmetry of the circular stone , @xmath206 and @xmath207 .",
    "moreover , because only the lift component of the reaction force ( along @xmath9 ) is considered in the present analysis , we have @xmath208 and @xmath209 .    equation  ( [ euler.b ] ) yields immediately that @xmath210",
    ". we therefore have @xmath211 , with @xmath136 the initial spin velocity .",
    "equation  ( [ euler.c ] ) can be therefore written as : @xmath212 if we use @xmath205 , eq .",
    "( [ thiseq ] ) can be integrated once to give @xmath213 with @xmath214 , the initial tilt angle .",
    "the substitution of eq .",
    "( [ a3 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ euler.a ] ) leads to eq .",
    "( [ momentum ] ) .",
    "note that the nontrivial point is to assume that @xmath12 does not vanish and reaches a finite value in the small @xmath1 and @xmath16 limit .",
    "we may invoke the finite aspect ratio ( thickness over lateral size ) of the object .",
    "for example , if the stone is an ellipsoid of revolution with thickness @xmath215 and radius @xmath3 , with @xmath216 , we expect @xmath217.@xcite however the proportionality constant is expected to be sufficiently large so that the lift effect is non - negligible .",
    "this property is exemplified by water skiing . in this case , the lift force is sufficiently large to sustain the weight of a skier on small boards , while both tilt and incidence angles are close to zero .",
    "it is amusing to note that the laws of friction for the stone are similar to those of solid friction .",
    "we have indeed @xmath218 , with @xmath109 , independent of the velocity and surface of the stone .",
    "of course , the same result holds for water skiing , which is not obvious ."
