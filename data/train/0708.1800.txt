    "an illustration ( but without imposing statistical fluctuations ) of how the line detected in _ chandra _ would appear in the _ xmm _ data is plotted in red .",

    "xmm_-newton to detect the line seen with _",
    "chandra_.    two main reasons that explain the non - detection of the x - ray absorption line in the _ chandra _ letg+hrc data may also apply there .",
    "first , the continuum is slightly higher in _ chandra _ data . at 20  ,",
    "the _ chandra _ observations show @xmath41 counts per bin , compared with @xmath33 counts in the _ xmm _ data .",
    "secondly , and most importantly , the lsf of the rgs1 not only is larger than that of the letgs , but also has rather extended wings . as pointed out by williams et al .",
    "( 2006 ) in a study of the _ xmm _ data of mrk  421 , the central 0.1   region of a line contains about 96% of the total line flux for _ chandra _ letg , for rgs this number decreases to @xmath42 . in figure",
    "[ fig : lsf ] the dotted line is the lsf of the rgs1 .",
    "the wings of the rgs1 are even broader than that of the letg+hrc .",
    "we ran a similar monte - carlo simulation on the rgs1 data .",
    "the result supports our finding : out of 10,000 trials , a @xmath28 line is detected in only @xmath25 10% rgs1 spectra , compared with nearly @xmath25 57% detection in the letg+acis spectra , and @xmath25 25% detection in the letg+hrc spectra .",
    "following fang02 and assuming that the line is not saturated , the column density of the redshifted absorption line at @xmath43  is n()@xmath44 .",
    "the line width sets an upper limit to the path length of @xmath45 mpc based on the hubble flow . , and a standard @xmath46cdm model with @xmath47 and @xmath48 throughout the paper ] this gives @xmath49 @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the metallicity in units of 0.1 solar abundance , @xmath52 is the ionization fraction in units of 0.5 and @xmath53 is the path length in units of @xmath54 mpc . a lower limit to the path length of @xmath25 1 mpc can be obtained by assuming the absorber has the size of the small galaxy group detected in 21 cm images ( shull et al .",
    "1998 ) , which gives @xmath55 @xmath56 .",
    "this implies a range of baryon overdensities of @xmath57 , which , as found in fang02 , is consistent with the predicted density of the whim gas from cosmological hydrodynamic simulations ( see , e.g. , cen & ostriker  1999 ; dav et al .  2001 ) .    to constrain the temperature we need to study the ionization structure of the absorber . assuming collisional ionization equilibrium , the ionization fraction is a function of temperature only , and @xmath58 ( ) , the ionization fraction of , has a peak value of @xmath25 0.5 between 2 and 5 @xmath59 k. a constraint on the temperature of the absorber can be obtained by studying the column density ratio between and .",
    "non - detection of the at the corresponding redshifted position ( @xmath60  ) with a 3@xmath10 upper limit on the equivalent width of @xmath25 9.6 m , implies n ( ) @xmath61 , or @xmath62n()/n()@xmath63 \\gtrsim 0.22 $ ] .",
    "this constrains the temperature to be @xmath64 k. however , we need to be careful about the assumption of collisional ionization equilibrium ( cen & fang  2006 )",
    ".    we can actually strengthen the constraint on temperature by searching for potentially co - existing absorption lines at other wavelengths .",
    "recently , shull et al .",
    "( 2003 ) reported the detection of a series of and absorbers along the sight line towards pks  2155 - 304 between 16185 and 17116 @xmath65 .",
    "based on fang02 they resorted to a multi - phase model to explain the kinematic offsets among , and absorbers .",
    "the new measurement presented here indicates that these absorbers may coexist owing to the small separation in velocity space .",
    "for instance , the x - ray absorber may coexist with the component a in their observation , which is located between 16185 and 16252 @xmath65 and shows absorption line .",
    "if this is indeed a single absorber , we can set a tight range of the -to- ratio : @xmath66n()/n()@xmath63 \\lesssim -1.90 $ ] .",
    "this in turn sets temperature : @xmath67 k. using the previous constraint from the -to- ratio , we can put a tight constraint on the temperature of the component a : @xmath68 k.    our discussion on the density and temperature of the 20.0 absorber depends on several crucial assumptions that need to be closely examined .",
    "first , we assume the line is unsaturated .",
    "however , the 90% upper limit on the intrinsic line width can only give a doppler-@xmath69 parameter of @xmath70 , much larger than the typical thermal broadening width @xmath71of a few million - degree gas .",
    "the non - detection of the high - order lyman series , particularly the ly@xmath72 line at the rest - frame of @xmath73  ,  can rule out the saturate scenario at @xmath74 level only , and we notice in some cases the local x - ray absorption line could be saturated ( williams et al .",
    "2006 ; yao & wang  2006 , 2007 ) .",
    "if the line is saturated , the derived column density can be treated as a lower limit only .",
    "if the line is indeed unsaturated , it will be broad . as suggested by the clump - infall model in shull",
    "et al .  ( 2003 ) , a shock - wave of @xmath75 from structure evolution can provide such a non - thermal broadening mechanism : such a shock - wave would produce a post - shock temperature of @xmath76 k.    secondly , we assume the gas is in collisional ionization equilibrium .",
    "recent study , using numerical simulation , shows that non - equilibrium evolution of various ion species can produce significantly different effects ( cen & fang  2006 ; yoshikawa & sasaki  2006 ) , since the timescales for ionization and recombination are not widely separated from the hubble timescale .",
    "also , the relaxation process between electrons and ions may produce a two - temperature structure in the igm and have impact on the metal ionization fraction , since the relaxation time is comparable to the hubble timescale ( yoshida et al .",
    "however , we expect such process would be more important for hotter gas at @xmath77 k ( yoshida et al .",
    "2005 ) . at very low density , especially at @xmath78 , photoionization",
    "can also become important ( see , e.g. , hellsten et al .",
    "1998 ; nicastro et al .",
    "2002 ; chen et al .  2003 ; williams et al .",
    "for instance , at @xmath79 , the ionization curve peaks at @xmath80 k under the cosmic x - ray background radiation ( chen et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "finally , we discuss the coexistence of and absorbers primarily because of the proximity in radial velocities .",
    "however , as suggested by shull et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , the line width is narrow ( @xmath81 fwhm ) , and the scenario that and can coexist is marginally plausible within measurement errors ( @xmath82 ) .    the baryonic content @xmath83 ( ) that is probed by the absorption",
    "can be estimated following lanzetta et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and tripp et al .",
    "given the path length of the sight line toward pks  2155 - 304 of @xmath84 and assuming an upper limit of metallicity of @xmath85 , we estimate @xmath83 ( ) @xmath86 , or about 10% of the total baryon fraction .",
    "this number is consistent with the prediction of the whim gas from numerical simulations .",
    "based on this single detection , the observed distribution @xmath87 , defined as number of absorbers per unit redshift , is higher than what simulation predicts ( see , e.g. , cen & fang  2006 , fig .  4 ) .",
    "we certainly need more detections to improve statistics .",
