    "in this section , we discuss the simplest situation when a small - q electron - phonon coupling ( epc ) may arise and show how the obtained epc maps to a sebarable one without affecting any of the basic physics .",
    "the epc function is defined as : @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the momentum dependent electron - phonon spectral function ( epsf ) , which for a single phonon branch is : @xmath100 with @xmath101 the electron - phonon matrix element ( epme ) @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most common situation when small - q processes dominate can take place when large dielectricity and the long range nature of the coulomb potential are considered , as first discussed by abrikosov ( ref .",
    "@xcite of main text ) . as a paradigm",
    ", we analyze this case in some detail . due to the modulation of the screened coulomb potential",
    ", there exists a first - order coupling between electrons and phonons @xcite . in this case , the electron - phonon matrix element is given by : @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the exchanged momentum , m is the ionic mass , @xmath104 is the renormalized phonon dispersion , @xmath105 is the phonon polarization , @xmath106 is the bare coulomb potential , @xmath20 is the static dielectric constant and @xmath107 is the static dielectric function . the renormalized phonon dispersion is just @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the phonon plasma frequency . in the simplest picture , the dielectric function can be written in the thomas - fermi approximation as : @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the thomas - fermi screening wavevector and @xmath112 .    compining the above relations , the epc can be written in the following form : @xmath113 where the effective parameter @xmath114 includes all remaining terms and",
    "@xmath115 is a bosonic frequency ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "the epc has a small - q momentum dependence peaked at @xmath117 and a lorentzian frequency dependence whose width is determined again by @xmath111 .",
    "thus , even in this rough approximation , the epc acquires a small - q momentum dependence with the momentum cutoff defined by the thomas - fermi screening wavevector .",
    "the peak at small - q gets more pronounced by reduction of the density of states or an increase in the dielectric constant . at low energies , ( @xmath118=0 or t=0 ) , eq.([lkk1 ] ) reduces to : @xmath119 increasing the ratio t/@xmath109 , eq.([lkk1 ] ) approaches the form of eq.([lkk0 ] ) for @xmath120 . for parameters relevant to lifeas",
    "this is the case near @xmath121 ( i.e. see fig.[smqsep ] ) .",
    "thus , @xmath122 behaves like a separable function over momentum and frequency in the physical range that we are interested in .",
    "let us now assume an effective separable epc .",
    "this can be achieved , for example , if the epsf is separable and the frequency dependent part is described by an einstein spectrum @xcite : @xmath123 inserting eq.([eph ] ) into eq.([lkknn ] ) one easily gets : @xmath124 at low energies ( @xmath125/t=0 ) the above reduces to : @xmath126 which we assume to have a small - q structure within a cutoff @xmath18 .",
    "thus , we can write : @xmath127 obviously , the above matches exactly eq.([lkk1 ] ) at low energies ( @xmath118=0/t=0 ) and for @xmath128 , @xmath129 . in our calculations for lifeas",
    ", we set @xmath130=@xmath131=100 k ( ref .",
    "@xcite of main text ) .",
    "we observe that already at t=10k the epc of eq.([lkknn ] ) and eq.([lkknnsep ] ) agree very well as it is shown in fig.[smqsep ] .     for @xmath132=0.3 ,",
    "@xmath130=100k at t=10k and different matsubara frequencies .",
    "the agreement between @xmath22 and @xmath133 is evident.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]",
    "our starting point is the system of coupled anisotropic eliashberg equations at the finite temperature : @xmath134 \\frac{\\delta_{{\\bf k}',n'}}{\\sqrt{\\omega^2_{n'}+\\delta_{{{\\bf k}',n'}}^2}}\\rangle^{fs}_{{\\bf k}'}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the nth matsubara freuency @xmath135 , @xmath136 is the strong - coupling renormalization parameter , @xmath137 is the sc gap function , @xmath11 the epc and @xmath138 is the coulomb pseudopotential which comes with a cutoff @xmath139 in the matsubara frequency summation and is taken as band independent .",
    "the notation @xmath140 means an average over the entire fs , where @xmath17 is the density of states ( dos ) , @xmath141 the angularly resolved dos ( ardos ) and @xmath142 the energy dispersion at the fermi level ( @xmath143 ) . in this formalism",
    ", all band structure effects are conveniently encoded in the fs averages and the anisotropy of the fs is fully taken into account .",
    "eq.([el01])-([el02 ] ) provide the strong coupling description of a phonon mediated , singlet or unitary triplet , superconductor ( e.g. see @xcite ) having an arbitrary number of bands contributing to the fs @xcite . in this sense , @xmath144 are global quantities defined over the entire fs . for an @xmath145-band sc ,",
    "it is possible to degrade the above into a system of @xmath146-coupled equations for @xmath147 defined on each separate band , however by doing so , the momentum dependence of the epc is lost ( e.g. see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "thus , throughout this study , we work in the most generalized framework as defined above .",
    "note that , since the values of @xmath25 that we consider are very small , we have neglected the energy shift self - energy term .      linearizing the above system at @xmath0 , introducing the separable approximation : @xmath148 and re - expressing the matsubara sum on positive frequencies yields : @xmath149 where we have explicitely assumed even frequency sc and @xmath150=@xmath151 , @xmath152=@xmath153 , and we have used the relation : @xmath154 . from eq.([zlin ] ) , it is evident that @xmath155 has become separable . inserting eq.([zlin ] ) into eq.([dlin ] ) we see that the sc gap has also acquired a separable structure and thus , we can write : @xmath156=@xmath157 , where @xmath36 contains the frequency and @xmath38 the momentum dependence , respectively .    inserting eq.([zlin ] ) into eq.([dlin ] ) , multiplying both sides with @xmath158 and then taking the fs average gives : @xmath159w_{n'}\\delta_{n'}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which , after some rearanging can be written as : @xmath160\\tilde{\\delta}_{n'}=0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath161 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the above is an eigenvalue problem similar to the one encountered in usual eliashberg theory @xcite but extended to include the full momentum dependence of the sc gap and it can be solved following standard methods @xcite for the @xmath0 provided that @xmath37 is known .",
    "obviously , for @xmath162 the usual isotropic eliashberg equation is retrieved .",
    "since @xmath35 , we can apply a square - well ansatz @xcite to eq.([zlin])-([dlin ] ) in order to extract an equation for the momentum dependent part of the sc gap : @xmath163 it is easy to observe that within this model @xmath155 becomes : @xmath164 and the gap equation takes the form : @xmath165 which after a standard summation on matsubara frequencies yields : @xmath166 where @xmath167}$ ] .",
    "this is an eigenvalue equation for the momentum part of the sc gap alone , which when solved self - consistently provides the exact @xmath37 .",
    "notice that in this case @xmath37 is not just a form factor corresponding to an irreducible representation , but it is rather a superposition of form factors and all their harmonics of all the allowed irreducible representations , i.e. it is the _ realistic _ sc structure favored by the system s specific characteristics .      at t=0",
    ", the eliashberg equations can be treated approximately to give a closed form , bcs - like equation .",
    "this can be achieved by neglecting @xmath156 in eq.([el01 ] ) and further applying the square - well ansatz ( see e.g. ref.@xcite ) .",
    "using @xmath47 in eq.([el02 ] ) and taking the zero t limit ( @xmath168 ) gives :      after self - consistently solving the above equation , @xmath37 is retrieved .",
    "the correct solution is determined by minimizing the respective free energy difference between the normal and the sc state within eliashberg theory @xcite .",
    "a momentum dependent expression for the latter is @xcite : @xmath170 applying the square - well approximation , taking the t=0 integral over matsubara frequencies and for @xmath171 we find the respective condensation energy as : @xmath172 the isotropic version of eq.([bcslike ] ) has been previously considered in multiband eliashberg theories , where it has been shown that it , in fact , captures the full eliashberg results very well ( e.g. see ref.@xcite ) .",

    "<S> precisely the same behavior was observed recently by nmr . </S>",
    "<S> our results provide a natural and universal understanding of the conflicting experimental observations in lifeas .    </S>",
    "<S> 0.7 cm    in iron arsenide superconductors are observed not only the higher critical temperatures after those observed in cuprates but also a plethora of exciting phenomena yet to be understood . </S>",
    "<S> perhaps the most challenging compound is the stoichiometric lifeas @xcite which exhibits a suprisingly exotic superconducting phenomenology . </S>",
    "<S> measurements of nmr @xcite , inelastic neutron scattering @xcite and specific heat @xcite in this compound have been interpreted in terms of multigap singlet s@xmath4 sc @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the gap seen by arpes indicates an anisotropic , singlet and one sign s@xmath5 order parameter @xcite . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> there is also consistent evidence for _ p - wave spin triplet sc _ in lifeas , first reported by quasiparticle interference ( qpi ) @xcite and nmr @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> subsequent high magnetic field measurements have found that this state can also be induced by the field and it is _ chiral _ @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the nmr data have posed yet another extraordinary puzzle . </S>",
    "<S> depending on small changes of the stoichiometry , some of the samples exhibit singlet sc , while the slightly more electron doped samples show triplet sc @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it was recently reported that some samples exhibit _ a temperature induced singlet to triplet transition _ as temperature rises @xcite . clearly , not only do we observe in lifeas the highest temperature , by an order of magnitude , _ triplet _ sc state ( t@xmath6=16 - 18 k ) , but in addition this state emerges away from any magnetically ordered phase and exhibits some of the most surprising phase transition phenomena in a sc regime . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , understanding theoretically the complex and seemingly conflicting sc phenomenology of lifeas is arguably one of the most challenging issues in the field of superconductivity .    </S>",
    "<S> the electronic structure of lifeas is characterized by reduced nesting properties and a _ van hove _ point ( vhp ) at the _ center _ of the brillouin zone ( bz ) @xcite ( see fig.1(a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> although antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations ( sfs ) are generally weak in this material @xcite , their importance for sc is yet unresolved @xcite . on the contrary , there is clear evidence of an enhanced electron - phonon interaction ( epi ) , strong enough to account for lifetime effects and the order of magnitude of the measured t@xmath6 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> so far , it has been argued that ferromagnetic sfs may drive the triplet sc @xcite . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the s@xmath5 sc has been interpreted in terms of orbital fluctuations assisted by phonons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> even if either mechanism is proven relevant for lifeas , it still remains unclear how it could explain coherently the conflicting gap symmetry observations .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that _ all _ of the aforementioned exotic phenomenology is consistently explained , in a unified way , if the enhanced epi in this material has a momentum dependence peaked at _ small - q _ , similar to the one observed recently in cuprates @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis is based on fully anisotropic , self - consistent calculations of the sc gap within the eliashberg approach , assuming a realistic small - q epi and using the arpes resolved multi - band structure for lifeas as reported by the experiments . remarkably , using an overall electron - phonon coupling ( epc ) strength of @xmath7 consistent with phonon damping effects in the arpes spectra and reasonable characteristic phonon frequencies of about 100 k , </S>",
    "<S> the same eliashberg calculations produce the right critical temperatures as well .    </S>",
    "<S> small - q epi can occur due to strong ionic and/or coulombic effects @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that large ionic polarizabilities that may lead to enhanced dielectricity have indeed been reported in pnictides @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was early on understood that small - q epi may lead to _ unconventional _ sc of d - wave type in the cuprates @xcite and recent findings support the relevance of this type of interaction in these materials @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> other unconventional sc materials , including @xmath8-bedt organic salts @xcite , the heavy fermion upd@xmath9al@xmath10 @xcite and cobaltites @xcite have also been shown within a bcs framework to be compatible with this generic picture . </S>",
    "<S> recently , the first multiband bcs approach with the small - q epi mechanism in pnictides @xcite established that the reported unconventional sc states are compatible with the measures of finite isotope effect @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our present fully momentum dependent eliashberg calculations specifically dedicated to lifeas are of unprecedented precision . </S>",
    "<S> the quality with which the experimental behavior of lifeas is reproduced as well as the fact that a _ chiral triplet _ sc state in a real material is plausibly associated with a _ phononic _ </S>",

    "<S> we parametrize the epc as an effective , yet realistic , kernel separable over momentum and matsubara frequency : @xmath11=@xmath12 , where @xmath13 has an einstein form and @xmath14=@xmath15 , with @xmath16 an effective potential and @xmath17 the dos on the fs . </S>",
    "<S> the momentum cutoff @xmath18 selects the small wave vectors in the attractive phonon part while at larger wave vectors the repulsive coulomb pseudopotential may prevail . </S>",
    "<S> for example , such a cutoff may arise naturally due to the interplay between enhanced dielectricity and the long range nature of the coulomb potential . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest approximation to this case maps @xmath18 to the thomas - fermi ( tf ) screening wavevector , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the dielectric constant @xcite . in the case of lifeas , this provides with the rough estimate that @xmath18 should decrease away from stoichiometry , i.e. from the vhp . </S>",
    "<S> a small @xmath18 leads to a _ momentum decoupling _ ( md ) situation @xcite . in the md regime </S>",
    "<S> the gap function loses its rigidity in momentum space and becomes correlated with the variations of the dos , leading to fs momentum dependent and possibly unconventional sc . for a multiband system </S>",

    "<S> we estimate that for @xmath25=0 ( @xmath8650mev ) lifeas is in a @xmath1 ( @xmath56 ) state down to zero t.    our solutions for @xmath87mev are amenable to an interesting interpretation . in this regime </S>",

    "<S> for example , for @xmath25=10mev , @xmath45=0.13 and @xmath18=0.032 , we find two successive transitions , to @xmath56 sc below @xmath8818k and to @xmath3 sc below @xmath8916k ( see diamond symbol in fig.[pdtc](b ) and ( e ) ) , in perfect agreement with the findings of the latter experiments summarized in fig.4 of ref.@xcite . due to the small-@xmath18 values in this region , </S>",
    "<S> the enhanced md leads to a sc gap structure whose fs momentum dependence follows closely the fs dos . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we predict that the sc gap in both the @xmath3 and @xmath56 regions should exhibit maxima along @xmath26-m , as is shown e.g. in fig.[pdqcmu](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> our key results for @xmath45=0.13 are summarized on table [ table1 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , given the close proximity of @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath56 states found within our theory , it is natural to expect that an applied magnetic field would induce a singlet to triplet transition in lifeas , either by suppresing singlet pairing or by enhancing the fs dos anisotropy or both , thus favoring @xmath56 sc . </S>",

    "<S> furthermore , we explicitly showed that slight deviations from stoichiometry and/or changes in temperature may favor one of these states . </S>",
    "<S> our results resolve the conflict between a strong epc and one sign singlet sc reported by arpes and unconventional and , most interestingly , chiral triplet sc observed by other probes . </S>",

    "<S> the accuracy of the present results and the exotic character of the involved sc states , establish that the small - q epi mechanism should be considered on an _ equal footing _ with spin and other purely electronic mechanisms , in the analysis of _ any _ unconventional superconductor . </S>",
