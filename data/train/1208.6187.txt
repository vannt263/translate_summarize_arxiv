    "photosynthesis is an essential means to obtain energy for all life forms on earth .",
    "although the detailed structures of photosynthetic systems are complicated and species - dependent , it is now believed that solar photons are absorbed to produce electronic excited states ( called excitons ) in molecular chromophores that are found in light - harvesting ( or antenna ) complexes .",
    "many antenna complexes , together with reaction center complexes which can convert the energy stored in the excitons to chemical energy via biochemical reactions , form a transportation network for excitons .",
    "the photoexcitation process starts with the exciton creation in the antenna complexes , which is followed by exciton transfer across the pigment network , and ends with exciton trapping by the reaction center complexes .",
    "this energy transport process is completed on a 10 - 100 picosecond timescale @xcite . in recent years the high efficiency and quantum coherence of the exciton transfer processes amidst a noisy environment have atrracted great interest @xcite .",
    "the mechanism for such coherent transport has been extensively studied with various theoretical models @xcite .",
    "the exciton transfer from antennas to reaction centers is often modeled by the semiclassical frster theory which considers incoherent hoppings between sites @xcite . to account for coherence in the energy transport processes , a microscopic description is provided by the redfield theory where the exciton dynamics is solved from a master equation in a reduced space of excitons in the weak phonon coupling and born - markov approximation @xcite .",
    "based on this theory , silbey _ et al .",
    "_ developed an approach for the diffusion of excitons @xcite ; haken and strobl used a stochastic model @xcite ; and kenkre and knox established a generalized master equation formalism @xcite to investigate the coherent and incoherent aspects of the excitonic transfer . to make the models more realistic , zhang _",
    "_  introduced a modified redfield equation to include static disorder in the exciton system @xcite which was later used to simulate the energy transfer dynamics in light - harvesting complexes of green plants @xcite .",
    "silbey and co - workers proposed a generalized theory which includes coherent transport effects only within donors and acceptors while treating interactions between them with the standard frster model @xcite .",
    "a comparison between frster , redfield , and other models is given by yang and fleming in ref .",
    "@xcite . with a master equation approach in the born - markov and secular approximations , mohseni _ et al .",
    "_ carried out computer simulations and found that the energy transport efficiency can be enhanced by modulating environmental noise @xcite .    in the energy transfer process in photosynthetic systems , excitons are successionally created in the antennas and then trapped in the reaction centers , generating an uninterrupted energy flow from the antennas to the reaction centers . this energy flow is significantly affected not only by the coherence and decoherence effects during the exciton transfers across the pigment network , but also by the creation and annihilation of the excitons in the antennas and the reaction centers , respectively .",
    "in fact , if the excitons are viewed as energy carriers in the photosynthetic processes , the creation and annihilation of them in the antennas and the reaction centers play roles of source and drain of carriers , respectively .",
    "thus , the widely used source - network - drain models describing continuous current of electron transport in quantum systems may also be applicable to treat the energy flow in photosynthetic systems if the creation and annihilation of excitons can be properly addressed .",
    "this work is aimed to describe the excitonic energy transport in photosynthetic systems with a full quantum - mechanical source - network - drain model .",
    "we include on an equal footing effects of scattering , disorder , exciton - phonon interactions , thermal excitations in a noisy environment , and efficiencies of antennas and reaction centers .",
    "the key issues are how to model exciton creations and annihilations with a suitable pair of source and drain , and how to include the thermal ( temperature ) effect in such a quantum - mechanical treatment .",
    "we use incoming ( source ) channels and outgoing ( drain ) channels for the creation and annihilation of excitons in antennas and reaction centers , and those channels are semi - infinite with the ends connected to different sites of a pigment network so that the exciton current from the source to the drain can be sustained . considering that this process is taking place in a thermal bath , we include interactions between excitons and bath phonons in the network . with these key ingredients captured by a hermitian hamiltonian",
    ", the wave functions of exciton and phonons can be directly solved via the schrdinger equation without invoking any classical or semiclassical approximations .",
    "structural fluctuations in realistic systems are modeled with adding disorders to control parameters in the hamiltonian .",
    "exciton creation and annihilation rates can be adjusted by parameter - tuning of incoming and outgoing channels . after obtaining the wave functions , the exciton current , which reflects the efficiency of the photosynthesis ,",
    "is calculated via the extended landauer - buttiker formula which works in the hilbert space for many - body states @xcite .",
    "the numerical results show that the creation and annihilation rates in antennas and reaction centers and their adaptability have crucial effects on the total efficiency and the degree of coherence in the network .",
    "it is interesting that the efficiency may be enhanced by introducing randomness and thermal excitations in many parameter regimes . at ambient temperature",
    "the efficiency may reach its maximum or saturation .",
    "this can help explain why photosynthesis is so efficient at room temperature and in noisy environments .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present the basic model and formalism . in the third section",
    "we discuss the results in the absence of interactions with phonons and analyze the effect of static randomness . in section",
    "iv we include the interaction with phonons and investigate the effect of thermal excitations on the energy transport .",
    "a brief summary is given in section v.",
    "we consider the following hamiltonian for the exciton transport in a photosynthetic energy - transfer system : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the hamiltonian of a pigment network for exciton transport , such as the the light harvesting lh1 and lh2 photosynthetic complexes in a membrane of _ rsp .",
    "photometricum _ @xcite and the fenna - mathews - olsen ( fmo ) protein complex in green sulfur bacteria @xcite , connecting the antennas with the reaction centers .",
    "@xmath1 can be written as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the creation operator of exciton on site @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the site energy for excitons , and @xmath6 is the hopping integral for excitons from site @xmath7 to site @xmath4 .",
    "one has @xmath8 as the hamiltonian is hermitian . here",
    "a site may label a single chromophore or a cluster of chromophores . for the former",
    ", @xmath6 originates from nearest - neighbor transfer integrals and frster dipole - dipole interactions between well - separated pigments , both of which are strongly dependent on the distance between the pigments @xcite . for the latter , @xmath5 is the resonance level to host an exciton in the @xmath4th cluster of chromophores , while @xmath6 labels the effective transfer integral between @xmath4th and @xmath7th clusters with a distance dependence that differs from that in the frster theory @xcite .",
    "@xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) is the tight - binding hamiltonian for the source ( drain ) , describing a semi - infinite virtual chain connected to a site in the pigment network as a path of the successional creation ( annihilation ) of excitons in an antenna ( reaction center ) by radiation ( biochemical reaction ) , @xmath11,\\ ] ] where a semi - infinite chain is labeled by the index @xmath4 of a network site to which it is connected , @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) is the set of chains belonging to source ( drain ) , @xmath14 denotes the position on the chain counting from the pigment network , and @xmath15 is the nearest - neighbor hopping integral in the @xmath4th virtual chain .",
    "thus the tight - binding hamiltonian of the @xmath4th chain yields a transition exciton band of width @xmath16 centered at @xmath5 , and both @xmath15 and @xmath5 vary from chain to chain as the transition bands depend on detailed configurations .",
    "the widths of transition bands in the virtual chains mimic the energy uncertainty of excitons caused by the timescales of the photon - exciton conversion events in the antennas and charge separation events in the reaction centers . for systems relevant to photosynthesis @xcite ,",
    "@xmath15 varies from 1 mev to 10 mev , and @xmath5 from 1 ev to 2 ev . as the events occur in a quantized manner , these band widths are intrinsic parameters independent of actual light intensity in antennas or actual energy flow in reaction canters .",
    "in fact , the widths only set upper limits on the exciton currents flowing from the sources to the drains , and actual currents may be much smaller than those limits as they are also determined by light intensities and adsorption cross sections in antennas and by exciton trapping rates in reaction centers @xcite .",
    "these additional physical ingredients , which can be viewed as external conditions that vary from time to time , are not included in the hamiltonian , but their influences on exciton statistics in the sources and the drains will be taken into account in the formulation of the exciton current .",
    "the combined hamiltonian may be illustrated by fig .  1 , where the networked sites corresponding to the antennas ( reaction centers ) are represented with green ( magenta ) circles , and the creation ( annihilation ) of excitons",
    "is represented with dashed incoming ( dotted outgoing ) arrows attached to corresponding sites . for a specific system such as fmo ,",
    "a site in the pigment network may be connected to an antenna or a reaction center , and it is also possible that it is linked only to adjacent sites in the network .",
    "detailed configurations in the source - network - drain model can be determined from a realistic photosynthetic system of interest . in this work , however , we are concerned with generic features of energy transfer in photosynthesis instead of effects of detailed configurations .",
    "we will therefore consider a network in two dimensions ( 2d ) with closely packed sites with a distribution of control parameters .",
    "static disorder erases structural details but the salient features remain after configurational averages .",
    "the 2d network to be studied here resembles , for example , the rc - lh1-lh2 photosynthetic complexes in a membrane of _ rsp .",

    "the antenna ( reaction center ) sites are represented with green ( magenta ) circles which are interconnected forming a network , and creation ( annihilation ) of excitons is represented with dashed incoming ( dotted outgoing ) arrows attached to corresponding sites .",
    "the couplings between sites , represented with brown links in the network , correspond to hopping integrals @xmath6 in hamiltonian @xmath1 , while the incoming and outgoing channels expressed by the arrows depict virtual semi - infinite chains in hamiltonians @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    ", width=510 ]    in the photosynthetic process the excitons are constantly flowing into the network via the incoming channels .",
    "the incident exciton with energy @xmath17 in an incoming channel @xmath4 ( @xmath18 ) can be expressed by a plane wave propagating along channel @xmath4 towards the network @xmath19 a^\\dag_{i , n } | 0\\rangle,\\ ] ] where @xmath20 $ ] is the wave vector and @xmath17 is distributed within the interval @xmath21 $ ] .",

    "the transmission and reflection amplitudes @xmath31 and @xmath32 can be solved from the schdinger equation with the transfer - matrix or green function technique , @xmath33 the total exciton current through the system , representing the total efficiency of the photosynthesis , can be calculated by the landauer - buttiker formula summing over all incident and output channels and integrating over energy @xcite as : @xmath34.\\ ] ] here @xmath35 is the transmission probability from channel @xmath4 to channel @xmath7 for given energy @xmath17 , @xmath36 is the exciton velocity in the @xmath4th chain , and the ratio @xmath37 accounts for the difference in transport rate between the input and output channels .",
    "the integration range @xmath38 is the region of @xmath17 where both @xmath39 and @xmath40 are real .",
    "the first and second terms in the integrand correspond to the currents from source to drain ( positive ) and from drain to source ( negative ) , respectively .",
    "the sign of the total current is controlled by @xmath41 , the probability that the state of energy @xmath17 in the @xmath4th chain has exciton to emit while the state in the @xmath7th chain is empty and available to adsorb the exciton .",
    "so we can express @xmath41 as @xmath42 , where @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) is probability of state in the @xmath4th ( @xmath7th ) chain being occupied ( vacant ) . as the excitons are created ( adsorbed ) only in source ( drain ) chains , @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) is nonzero only when @xmath18 ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "this guarantees that the second term in the above formula is always zero and the current is positive ( from source to drain ) .",
    "@xmath43 as a function of energy is determined by the light intensity and adsorption cross section in antennas , while @xmath44 depends on the reopening timescale in reaction centers @xcite .",
    "although @xmath43 and @xmath44 set a further limitation on the energy transport , their effect can be taken into account simply by introducing a prefactor to the current .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we will adopt a simple form of @xmath41 : @xmath46 then the current can be calculated as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the ratio of velocities in channels @xmath4 and @xmath7 .",
    "taking into account the configurational fluctuations in the network , the antennas , and the reaction centers , we introduce disorder in @xmath5 and @xmath49 .",
    "since the inter - site coupling in the network decreases rapidly as the inter - site distance increases , only couplings between nearest neighbors ( nn ) are kept .",

    "the spectrum has a global resonance peak of the source - network - drain system .",
    "it is apparent that the width of the resonance peak is rather small , reflecting the narrow transition bands in the source and drain channels .",
    "detuning in the transition bands between the source and the drain rapidly reduces both the peak height and width . in the resonant case ,",

    "furthermore , the current approach provides a novel , flexible platform to investigate complicated interplays among various configurational , quantum and thermal factors in the energy transport processes of natural and artificial photosynthetic systems .",
    "previously , many theoretical efforts were based upon solving the phenomenological lindblad master equations with built - in dissipation . in this work",
    "we are interested in the steady state in which excitons flow continuously to the reaction centers , and our results are not affected by initial conditions and transient behavior .",
    "it is also possible to find the steady - state density matrix for a single - particle lindblad equation .",
    "we note that the exciton life time is in the order of nanoseconds while it takes hundreds of femtoseconds for an exciton to be transferred to a reaction center .",
    "this huge difference in timescale indicates that exciton decay can be neglected when considering excitonic energy transfers from antennas to reaction centers , therefore lending support to the landauer - buttiker scheme adopted here .",
    "our approach assumes the single - exciton picture in which the schrdinger equation is solved , and the applicability of this basic assumption to photosynthetic systems is justified by slow injection and fast transport of excitons in the pigment network . in a master - equation approach , energy transfer efficiency is measured by quantities such as the exciton trapping probability , while in the landauer - buttiker scheme it is described by the exciton current .",
    "furthermore , the total exciton current also provides a global description of the photosynthetic system with multi - channel inputs and outputs and interferences among them .",
