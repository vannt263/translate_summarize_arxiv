    "the _ quark gluon plasma _ ( @xmath0 ) usually is defined as the phase of _ quantum chromodynamics _ ( @xmath2 )",
    "in which the quarks and gluons degrees of freedom , that is normally confined within the hadrons , are mostly liberated .",
    "the possible phases of the @xmath2 and the precise locations of critical boundaries or points are currently being actively studied .",
    "in fact , revealing the @xmath2 phase transition structure is one of the central aims of the ongoing and the future theoretical and the experimental research in the field of the hot and/or the dense @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "it is about thirty years since the study of the hot and the dense nuclear matter in the form of the @xmath0 has been started .",
    "the experiments at the @xmath3 s _ super proton synchrotron _ ( @xmath4 ) first tried to create the @xmath0 in the 1980s and 1990s : the first hints of the formation of a new state of matter was obtained from the @xmath4 data in terms of the global observable , the event - by - event fluctuations , the direct photons and the di - leptons .",
    "the current experiments at the @xmath5 national laboratory s _ relativistic heavy ion collider _ ( @xmath6 ) are still continuing these efforts . in the april 2005 ,",
    "the formation of the quark matter was tentatively confirmed by the results obtained at the @xmath6 .",
    "the consensus of the four @xmath6 research groups was in favor of the creation of the quark - gluon liquid at the very low viscosity @xcite .",
    "since , in this new phase of matter , the quarks and the gluons are in the asymptotic freedom region , one expects that they interact weakly .",
    "so , the _ perturbative _ methods can be used for such a system .",
    "the asymptotic freedom suggests two procedures for the creation of the @xmath0 : @xmath7i@xmath8 the recipe for the @xmath0 at high temperature .",
    "if one treats the quarks and the gluons as the massless noninteracting gas of molecules , such that the baryon density vanishes , the critical temperature which above that , the hadronic system dissolves into a system of quarks and gluons ( @xmath0 ) is @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "however , the modern lattice @xmath2 calculation estimates the critical temperature , @xmath10 , to be about @xmath11 @xmath12 @xcite @xmath7ii@xmath8 the recipe for the @xmath0 at high baryon density . at zero temperature ,",
    "the critical baryon density required the transition to take place in @xmath13 @xcite i.e. four times the empirical nuclear matter density . on these grounds , one should expect to find the @xmath0 in two places in the nature : firstly , in the early universe , about @xmath14 after the _ cosmic big bang _ or secondly , at the core of _ super - dense stars _ such as the neutron and the quark stars .",
    "this new phase of matter can also be created in the initial stage of the _ little big bang _ by means of the relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions in the heavy ion accelerators @xcite .",
    "the critical temperature ( critical baryon density ) at the zero baryon density ( zero temperature ) has been obtained simply for the non - interacting , massless up and down quarks and gluons in the reference @xcite .",
    "some primary works in the zero baryon density and in the framework of the bag model have been also presented in the reference @xcite ( and the reference therein ) . for the more complicated field",
    "theoretical approaches see the references @xcite and the references therein .",
    "so it would be interesting to perform a similar calculation to reference @xcite , but with the non zero interaction , for the region in which both @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "so , in this work we generalize above calculations for the region with the finite temperature and the baryon density by considering the weakly interacting quarks in the framework of the _ one gluon exchange _ scheme .",
    "since it is intended to use the @xmath17 method in our calculation , it is assumed that @xmath18 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath19 on the temperature and the baryon density is ignored @xcite .",
    "we perform calculations beyond the zero hadronic pressure approximation of reference @xcite and the pressure of the excluded volume hadron @xcite model is also taken into account to find the corresponding @xmath0 transition phase diagram .",
    "so , the paper is organized as follows . in the section",
    "@xmath20 we review the derivation of the _ one gluon exchange _ interaction formulas @xcite based on the landau fermi liquid picture @xcite .",
    "the section @xmath21 is devoted to the calculation of the thermodynamics properties of the @xmath0 .",
    "the result and its comparison with the strange quark matter @xcite are given in the section @xmath22 .",
    "finally a conclusion and summary are presented in the section @xmath23 .",
    "the landau fermi liquid theory describes the relativistic systems such as : the nuclear matter under the extreme conditions , the quark matter , the quark gluon plasma , and other relativistic plasmas .",
    "the basic framework of the landau theory of relativistic fermi liquids is given by @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xcite . in this framework",
    ", one can evaluate the energy density of a weakly interacting quarks in @xmath0 by the following formulas : @xmath26 with @xmath27 where @xmath28 , is the degeneracy of quarks .",
    "@xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the kinetic and the potential energies and the familiar fermi - dirac liquid distributions of our quasi - particles , respectively . in the equation ( [ tatsumi ] ) , @xmath32 is the landau - fermi interaction function , which is a criterion for the interaction between the two quarks ( the `` @xmath33 '' superscript refers to the unpolarized quark matter @xcite ) .",
    "it is related to the two - particle forward scattering amplitude i.e. : @xmath34 @xmath35 is the commonly defined lorentz invariant matrix element .",
    "now , using the _ feynman rules _ for the @xmath2 , @xmath36 can be calculated . since",
    ", the direct term is proportional to the trace of the _ gelman matrices _ , the color symmetric matrix element is only given by exchange contribution : @xmath37 where @xmath38 ( our choice is @xmath39 ) . since our system is unpolarized , it is possible to sum over all the spin states and get the average of this quantity as : @xmath40 then for massless up and down quarks , @xmath41 so , the total energy of interacting quarks can be evaluated by using the equations ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) and ( 7 ) . in the next section , the various thermodynamic quantities of the interacting @xmath0 like the internal energy , the pressure , the entropy , etc are calculated .",
    "we begin with calculation of the free ultra - relativistic massless quarks partition function density , which follows by its non - interacting gluon contribution s .",
    "since we are interested in the heavy ion processes , it is assumed that the initial state to be the nuclear matter with the equal neutron and proton densities i.e. @xmath42 .",
    "so , @xmath43 and the contributions of @xmath44 and @xmath45 quarks are equal . then write the @xmath46 partition function for each quarks is written as ( @xmath47 is the volume ) , @xmath48\\frac{4\\pi g_{q}}{(2\\pi)^{3 } } k^{2 } dk.\\ ] ] this integral can be evaluated analytically i.e. , @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( in the @xmath52 factor unit ) .     and the strange quark matter , respectively.,width=415 ]     and the strange quark matter , respectively.,width=415 ]     and the strange quark matter , respectively.,width=415 ]     and the strange quark matter , respectively.,width=415 ]     equation of state as a function of baryon density at two fixed temperatures .",
    "the solid and dash curves are for the weakly interacting @xmath0 and the strange quark matter , respectively , but without the bag constant.,width=415 ]        .,width=415 ]     by taking into account the nuclear matter excluded volume pressure at four different bag pressures ( @xmath12).,width=415 ]    now we are in the position to evaluate the various thermodynamic quantities , such as the energy density , the entropy and the free energy from the above partition function , especially we have , @xmath53_{\\cal t } & & \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\hspace{-44 mm } = \\frac{4\\pi g_{q}}{3(2\\pi)^{3 } } ( \\pi^{2 } { \\cal t}^{2 } \\mu+\\mu^{3}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is the quark degeneracy for two , up and down quarks , flavors .",
    "all of the thermodynamic quantities are obtained as a function of chemical potential ( @xmath55 ) and temperature ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the temperature is a suitable experimental quantity but the chemical potential is not .",
    "so , it is better to rewrite the thermodynamic quantities as a function of the temperature and the baryon density , instead of the chemical potential . since the baryon number of a quark is @xmath57 , we have , @xmath58 , and : @xmath59 then , the chemical potential can be found as a function of @xmath60 and @xmath61 , from the above equation i.e. , @xmath62 so our thermodynamic quantities become a function of baryon density and temperature .    for the energy density of gluons we have , @xmath63 where again @xmath64 is the degeneracy of gluons .",
    "our system is ultra - relativistic , so , there is a simple relation between the pressure and the energy density : @xmath65 the bag pressure and the vacuum energy contributions should be included , in addition to the quark and the gluon contribution energies , @xmath66 having the pressure , the entropy density of system is evaluated , @xmath67 to study the phases of the @xmath0 , one should concentrate on the @xmath0 and the hadronic pressures , @xmath68 and @xmath69 @xcite , respectively , i.e. for @xmath70 , the system is in the confinement phase and the quarks and the gluons are inside the bag , but for @xmath71 , the quarks and the gluons pressures can overcome to the bag and the hadronic pressures and the system is in the de - confinement phase , i.e. the @xmath0 phase is created .",
    "so , the phase diagram can be extracted by solving the following equation : @xmath72 where in this work , both @xmath73 @xcite and @xmath74 @xcite cases are considered . for @xmath74 , the excluded volume effect for the nuclear matter equation of state",
    "is used @xcite to calculate the hadronic pressure ( equation ( 29 ) of reference @xcite ) i.e. , @xmath75},\\label{n2}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 is the pressure of free ideal nucleonic ( fermion ) matter @xcite ( here , degeneracy is 4 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , e.g see the equation ( 9 ) of the reference @xcite ) .",
    "now , the interaction energy between the quarks can be calculated by using the landau fermi liquid model and the results derived by us in the previous section .",
    "the potential energy density of the interacting massless up or down quarks is found by using the equations ( 3 ) and ( 7 ) , @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the quark degeneracy of one flavor . by using the fermi - dirac distribution and the value of each quark flavor potential energy i.e. the equation ( 21 ) , an analytical formula for the total potential energy density of the two quark flavours",
    "is written as follows : @xmath82 note that , the potential energy for massless quarks is always positive .",
    "so , the interaction between quarks inside the bag is repulsive and it helps the interacting quarks and the gluons to penetrate from the bag more easily , rather than the noninteracting case , and further more , the _",
    "one gluon exchange _ interaction , because of its repulsive properties , makes the conditions easier for the system to make the transition to the @xmath0 phase .",
    "the internal energy density of the @xmath0 is evaluated by performing the summation over the interacting and the non - interacting parts of the energy density of quarks , the vacuum energy and the gluon energy density which were calculated before , and having that , the other thermodynamic quantities of the @xmath0 are found .",
    "as it was pointed out before , it is assumed that the bag ( hadronic ) pressure is the one has been used in the reference @xcite i.e. @xmath83@xmath84 ( zero ) , in order to compare our phase diagram with this reference , and since it is intended to compare our results with the reference @xcite , the @xmath2 coupling constant os chosen to be @xmath85 . on the other hand , for the none zero hadronic pressure",
    ", the baryonic chemical potential and the bag pressure are varied to reach to the critical temperature of the lattice @xmath2 predictions @xcite , i.e. @xmath86 @xmath12 .",
    "we begin by presenting the calculated free energy per baryon for both the @xmath0 and the strange quark matter @xcite in the figure 1 ( 2 ) , as a function of baryon density ( temperature ) at the two different temperatures ( baryon densities ) . the free energy for the @xmath0 is larger than those of strange quark matter , since we know that the strange quark matter should be more stable than the @xmath0 and therefore the strange quark matter free energy should be smaller than that of the @xmath0 . as one should expect , the free energy increases ( decreases ) by increasing the baryon density ( temperature ) . while , the @xmath0 has less temperature dependent with respect to the strange quark matter , they have similar density dependent at fixed temperature .",
    "similar comparisons are made for the entropies in the figures 3 and 4 .",
    "the entropy per baryon for the @xmath0 is an increasing ( decreasing ) function of temperature ( baryon density ) and it is smaller than that of the strange quark matter @xcite .",
    "again their dependence on the density is the same , but they behave especially differently at larger temperatures .    the plots of the equation of states of both the @xmath0 ( without the effect of constant bag pressure ) and the strange quark matter as a function of baryon density at the two different temperatures are given in the figure 5 .",
    "the @xmath0 equation of state is much harder than that of strange quark matter at the same baryon density and temperature .",
    "the pressure of weakly interacting @xmath0 for the two different @xmath2 coupling constants , and the noninteracting @xmath0 ( without the effects of constant bag pressure ) at zero temperature as a function of baryon density is shown in the figure 6 .",
    "the increase in the interaction strength makes the pressure to rise , and therefore at the smaller baryon densities , the pressure of quarks becomes equal to the bag pressure .",
    "so , the interaction facilitates the quarks transition to the deconfined phase at lower density .",
    "the @xmath2 coupling constant also plays the same role , i.e it will reduce the transition density .    finally , the phase diagrams for both the interacting and the noninteracting @xmath0 are shown in the figure 7 for @xmath87 .",
    "the _ one gluon exchange _ interaction which is repulsive , causes to get the @xmath0 at the smaller baryon densities and temperatures .",
    "as it was pointed out before , the reason is very simple , the repulsive interaction between quarks helps them to escape from the bags .",
    "so the formation of the @xmath0 happens much easier for the interacting quarks than the noninteracting one .",
    "but , the critical temperature is about @xmath88 , which is much less than the lattice @xmath2 suggestion of @xmath89 . in the figure 8",
    ", the hadronic pressure has been also taken into the account ( see the equations ( [ n1 ] ) and the reference [ n2 ] ) .",
    "the slashed area is the forbidden region , i.e. for the bag pressure approximately larger than @xmath90 there is no critical temperature with the zero baryonic chemical potential ( density ) . with the bag pressure about @xmath91 (",
    "note that the bag pressure estimated to as large as @xmath92 @xmath12 @xcite ) and the low baryonic chemical potential ( density ) it is possible to get results near to the lattice @xmath2 prediction , i.e. @xmath86 @xmath12 .",
    "in conclusion , the _ one gluon exchange _ interaction was used to evaluate the strength of potential energy of the @xmath0 in the fermi liquid model . by calculating the @xmath0 partition function , the different thermodynamic properties of the @xmath0 as a function of baryon density and temperature for the both interacting and the non - interacting cases were discussed .",
    "it was found that the @xmath0 internal and free energies are much larger than those of strange quark matter . on the other side ,",
    "if we consider the massive quarks like the strange quarks in our the @xmath0 , the potential energy becomes a negative quantity , but for the massless quarks it is always a positive quantity , therefore the internal and the free energy densities of strange quark matter become smaller than the @xmath0 ones .",
    "we have seen how the _ one gluon exchange _ interaction for the massless quarks affects the phase diagram of the @xmath0 and causes the system to reach to the deconfined phase at the smaller baryon densities and temperatures .",
    "our results depend on the values of bag pressure and the @xmath2 coupling constant which the latter does not have a dramatic effect on our results .",
    "the increase of the hadronic and the bag pressure can improve our results toward the lattice @xmath2 calculations . in",
    "the future works , we could adjust our phase diagram to get the relation between the bag constant and the @xmath2 coupling constant . on the other hand it is possible to generalize our method for the non - constant @xmath2 coupling and the bag pressure .",
    "finally , we can also add the interaction between the gluons to our present calculations ."
