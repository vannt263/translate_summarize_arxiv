    "<S> ( [ anu ] ) and  ( [ anu1 ] ) we conclude that for the oxygen sites @xmath105 with the coefficient @xmath106mhz or @xmath107mhz dependent on the orientation of the magnetic field . using the experimental widths presented in table  [ t1 ] together with eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ tlw ] ) one finds values of @xmath108 for each particular oxygen ion and orientation of the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the values with indicative error bars are listed in the last column of table  [ t1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the average over the six different cases presented in the table is @xmath109 note , that the indicative error bars in table  [ t1 ] are not statistical , therefore in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ o1 ] ) we present the simple average value .    </S>",
    "<S> the cdw - induced broadening at cu sites comes from contributions of @xmath0- and @xmath27-waves , see eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ anu1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> below we assume that the phases are locked , @xmath110 . hence comparing eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ anu ] ) and  ( [ anu1 ] ) we conclude that for cu sites @xmath111mhz .    using the experimental widths presented in the top line of table  [ t1 ] together with eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ tlw ] ) we find @xmath112 it is very natural to assume that the amplitudes @xmath28 and @xmath29 are related as components of zhang - rice singlet , @xmath113 , see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . hence , using ( [ o1 ] ) , ( [ cu1 ] ) we come to the following cdw amplitudes at @xmath6k and @xmath114 t , @xmath115 the values of @xmath116 are in units of the number of holes per atomic site , and @xmath117 is the doping modulation amplitude in units of the number of holes per unit cell of a cuo@xmath2 plane . </S>",
    "<S> values of the amplitudes have not been reported previously , but the ratios have been deduced from the polarization - resolved resonant x - ray scattering  @xcite . our ratio @xmath118 is reasonably close to the value @xmath119 obtained in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , however the ratio @xmath120 is significantly larger than the value reported in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> superficially our ratio @xmath121 is reasonably close to the value @xmath122 obtained in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , on the other hand the ratio @xmath123 is significantly larger than the value reported in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , one has to be careful making a direct comparison of our results with ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis @xcite assumes either @xmath124 or @xmath125 models , while we keep the three components ( @xmath126 model ) . </S>",
    "<S> for example , it is easy to check that the @xmath127 model ( @xmath128 ) is inconsistent with the nqr data , so the agreement in the value @xmath122 is purely accidental . on the other hand , in principle we can fit the nqr data by the @xmath129 model ( @xmath130 ) , this results in @xmath131 that is inconsistent with @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the ratios of the cdw amplitudes @xmath132 , @xmath133 have been reported in stm measurements with bscco and naccoc @xcite . comparing these ratios </S>",
    "<S> ( although measured in different cuprates ) with our results we see that @xcite indicates dominance of the @xmath1-wave component , whereas in our analysis the @xmath0-wave amplitude is about a half of the @xmath1-wave amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> we do not have an explanation for the discrepancy between our results and rexs / stm measurements @xcite , moreover rexs and stm are inconsistent with each other . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage of our analysis is that it is very simple and straightforward and , of course , nqr is a bulk probe </S>",
    "<S> .    unfortunately , nqr data for magnetic field @xmath134 t are not that detailed as that for @xmath114 t . nevertheless , based on the cu nqr / nmr line broadening measured in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and rectifying the cu nqr line width ( subtracting the knight shift ) , we conclude that @xmath135mhz and @xmath136mhz . </S>",
    "<S> hence , using the same procedure as that for the low magnetic field , we find @xmath137 . </S>",
    "<S> again , assuming the zhang - rice singlet ratio , @xmath113 , we find the @xmath0-wave cdw amplitudes for @xmath134 t and @xmath8k : @xmath138 the doping modulation amplitude @xmath117 is about two times smaller than the estimate presented in ref .  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , data  @xcite are not sufficient for unambiguous subtraction of the knight shift broadening from oxygen lines , so the determination of @xmath139 is less accurate . however , roughly at @xmath134 t and @xmath8k the value is @xmath140 .    to complete our phenomenological analysis we comment on two broad classes of possible mechanisms of the cdw instability . </S>",
    "<S> ( i ) in the first class the cdw instability is driven purely by strongly correlated electrons which generate the charge wave . </S>",
    "<S> it can be due to electron - electron interaction mediated by spin fluctuations and/or due to the coulomb interaction , see e.g. refs  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we call this class of cdw formation mechanisms the `` electronic scenario '' . in this scenario phonons / lattice </S>",
    "<S> are not crucial for the cdw instability , they are only spectators that follow electrons . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) in the second class which we call the `` peierls / kohn scenario '' and which is known in some other compounds  @xcite , both electrons and phonons are involved in the cdw development on equal footing . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the phonon softening data might support the second class .    </S>",
    "<S> a very significant softening of transverse acoustic and transverse optical modes in ybco has been observed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the softening data are reproduced in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f5]a . </S>",
    "<S> the anomaly is very narrow in momentum space , @xmath141 r.l.u . , and it is only two times broader than the width of the elastic cdw peak , @xmath142 r.l.u . measured in rixs and xrd  @xcite .     in yba@xmath2cu@xmath143o@xmath144  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . * </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) * the expected phonon dispersion in the `` electronic scenario '' . </S>",
    "<S> blue solid lines show the dispersion in a perfect long - range cdw , grey lines represent the shadow bands . for a finite cdw correlation length </S>",
    "<S> the shadow bands practically disappear and solid blue lines become connected by the red solid line . ]    </S>",
    "<S> ( 0,0 ) ( -213,23)*a * ( -97,23)*b *    our observation is very simple , in the case of the `` electronic '' scenario , the electronic cdw creates a weak periodic potential @xmath145 for phonons . </S>",
    "<S> diffraction of phonons from the potential must lead to the usual band - structure discontinuity of the phonon dispersion @xmath146 at @xmath147 as it is shown by blue lines in panel b of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f5 ] . in the presence of the finite correlation length of the cdw </S>",
    "<S> the discontinuity is healed as it is shown by the red solid line at the same panel , and combined blue - red solid line shows the expected phonon dispersion . in supplementary material </S>",
    "<S> we present a calculation which supports this picture , but generally the picture is very intuitive . obviously , this physical picture for the phonon dispersion is qualitatively different from the experimental data in panel a of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f5 ] . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> the `` peierls / kohn scenario '' , where both electrons and phonons are equally involved in the cdw development , leads to phonon dispersions like that in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f5]a . </S>",
    "<S> this has been observed in several compounds , see e.g. refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> even though the phenomenological observation does not explain the mechanism of the cdw in underdoped cuprates , the observation poses a significant challenge to theoretical models based on `` the electronic scenario '' of the cdw formation . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the phonon softening is generally expected in the `` kohn / peierls scenario '' , which is likely to be the case in ybco . at the same time our arguments in favour of the `` kohn / peierls scenario '' are not quite conclusive . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , it seems that the `` kohn / peierls scenario '' does not provide an explanation of the strong broadening of ta and to phonon modes at @xmath148 [ 19 ] , as well as it does not explain why the phonon softening appears only in superconducting state @xmath149 . </S>",
    "<S> so the last point of our work is less solid than the main results concerning the amplitudes of the cdw . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , we believe that the presented discussion of the `` kohn / peierls scenario '' versus `` electronic scenario '' is useful for future work on the microscopic mechanism of the cdw .    in conclusion , our analysis of available experimental data has resolved open problems in the phenomenology of the charge density wave ( cdw ) in underdoped cuprates . </S>",
    "<S> we have determined the amplitudes of @xmath0- , @xmath27- , and @xmath1-wave components of the density wave . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitudes at low magnetic field and temperature @xmath6k are given in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ cdw1 ] ) , and the amplitudes for magnetic field @xmath150 t and temperature @xmath8k are given in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ cdw2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the data rule out a checkerboard pattern , and we also argue that the data might rule out mechanisms of the cdw which do not include phonons .    99    wu , t. _ et al . </S>",
