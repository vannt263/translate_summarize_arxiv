    "in la@xmath14sr@xmath15cuo@xmath6 ( lsco ) related compounds , the high - temperature structure is tetragonal ( htt , space group @xmath16 ) and there are three different low - temperature phases:@xcite the lto ( low - temperature orthorhombic , space group @xmath17 ) phase in lsco , the lto2 ( low - temperature orthorhombic 2 , space group @xmath18 ) phase in rare - earth ( r ) doped la@xmath19r@xmath5sr@xmath15cuo@xmath6 , and ltt ( low - temperature tetragonal , space group @xmath20 ) phase in la@xmath19r@xmath5sr@xmath15cuo@xmath6 with larger @xmath21 .",
    "these low - temperature structures are classified @xcite by the tilts of cuo@xmath22 octahedra around [ 110 ] and [ 1@xmath230 ] axes of the htt phase and have pronounced influence on the physical properties .",
    "for example , it has recently been realized that the holes in the high-@xmath24 cuprates mesoscopically segregate into quasi - one - dimensional antiphase domain boundaries between antiferromagnetically ordered cu spin regions , which is the so - called stripe phase;@xcite the static stripe order of charges and spins is only established in r ( nd , eu)-doped lsco,@xcite where the stripes are believed to be pinned by the particular tilting of cuo@xmath22 octahedra in the ltt phase.@xcite    it is known that the antiferromagnetic ( af ) insulating compound la@xmath11cuo@xmath6 ( lco ) , which has lto phase , shows predominant phonon heat transport at low temperatures , which is manifested in a large phonon peak at 20  25 k in the temperature dependence of both @xmath0-plane and @xmath1-axis thermal conductivities ( @xmath2 and @xmath3);@xcite such phonon peak was found to be completely suppressed in lsco with @xmath21 = 0.10  0.20.@xcite interestingly , it was found that in r - doped lsco , such as la@xmath25nd@xmath26sr@xmath9cuo@xmath6 , the low-@xmath13 thermal conductivity is much enhanced in the non - superconducting ltt phase , compared to that in lsco with the same sr content.@xcite this can not happen if the defect scattering and electron scattering of phonons are the only source of the phonon peak suppression in lsco .",
    "alternatively , it was proposed that the strong suppression of phonon heat transport in lsco is due to the strong phonon scattering by the structural distortion associated with the dynamical stripes , while r - doping leads to the formation of static stripes that significantly reduces the phonon scattering.@xcite however , this supposition would be too straightforward , because the low-@xmath13 structure phases are lto and ltt in lsco and r - doped lsco , respectively , which possess different phonon spectra and phonon scattering .",
    "in fact , it has already been reported that the structural symmetry does affect the phonon properties ; for example , the sound velocities in the three structures are known to be @xmath27(ltt ) @xmath28 @xmath27(lto2 ) @xmath28 @xmath27(lto),@xcite which implies that the phononic thermal conductivity is likely the largest in the ltt phase and the smallest in the lto phase .",
    "apparently , it is not a solid conclusion that the reappearance of phonon peak in r - doped lsco is due to the formation of static stripes , until evidence showing a direct relationship between the low-@xmath13 phonon heat transport and the static charge stripes ( rather than the structural transition ) is obtained .",
    "another question , apart from the structural phase transition , is how the r dopants themselves affect the phonon heat transport . a previous study on the nd - doped lco ( without charge doping )",
    "has shown that the phonon transport is somehow suppressed by nd - doping;@xcite however , no clear r - doping dependence of the heat conductivity was reported , probably because only polycrystalline samples were used in that study .",
    "it is therefore desirable to clarify the role of r - doping in the phonon heat transport by studying both r - doped lco and",
    "r - doped lsco single crystals .    to reduce the possible effect of magnetic moments of rare - earth ions on the heat transport behavior ,",
    "we select eu ion as the dopant , which has the smallest magnetic moment among rare - earth ions ( atomic number 57  71 ) , except for la and lu . in this paper",
    ", we report our study of the eu - doping effect on the phonon heat transport in two single - crystal systems : la@xmath4eu@xmath5cuo@xmath6 ( @xmath7 = 0 , 0.02 and 0.2 ) and la@xmath8eu@xmath5sr@xmath9cuo@xmath6 ( @xmath7 = 0 and 0.2 ) , which have lto2 and ltt phases for @xmath7 = 0.2 , respectively , at low temperature .",
    "it is found that for lco slight eu - doping ( @xmath7 = 0.02 ) induces anomalous wipeout of the phonon peak in @xmath2 , which is due to the local structural distortions induced by the local lto2 regions around eu ions in the lto phase , while further increase of eu content ( @xmath7 = 0.2 ) recovers the phonon peak , although the peak magnitude is much smaller than that of undoped lco .",
    "these results clearly show that rare - earth doping strongly suppress the phonon heat transport in lco . on the contrary",
    ", the eu - doping in lsco enhances the low-@xmath13 phonon transport , which , based on the new features found in our single crystals , we discuss to be most likely related to the formation of static stripes .",
    "the single crystals of la@xmath4eu@xmath5cuo@xmath6 and la@xmath8eu@xmath5sr@xmath9cuo@xmath6 are grown by the traveling - solvent floating - zone ( tsfz ) technique and carefully annealed.@xcite after the crystallographic axes are determined by using the x - ray laue analysis , the crystals are cut into rectangular thin platelets with the typical sizes of @xmath29 mm@xmath30 , where the @xmath1 axis is perpendicular or parallel to the platelet with an accuracy of 1@xmath31 .",
    "la@xmath4eu@xmath5cuo@xmath6 samples are annealed in flowing pure he gas to remove the excess oxygen . on the other hand ,",
    "la@xmath8eu@xmath5sr@xmath9cuo@xmath6 samples are annealed at 850 @xmath31c for 48 hours in air , followed by rapid quenching to room temperature , to remove the oxygen defects .",
    "the thermal conductivity @xmath32 is measured using a conventional steady - state technique at 2  150 k and a modified steady - state technique at 150  300 k.@xcite the temperature difference @xmath33@xmath13 on the sample is measured by a differential chromel - constantan thermocouple , which is glued to the sample using ge7031 varnish .",
    "the @xmath33@xmath13 varies between 0.5% and 2% of the sample temperature . to improve the accuracy of the measurement at low temperatures",
    ", @xmath32 is also measured with  one heater , two thermometer \" method from 2 to 20 k by using a chip heater and two cernox chip sensors.@xcite the errors in the thermal conductivity data are smaller than 10% , which is mainly caused by the uncertainties in the geometrical factors .",
    "magnetization measurements are carried out using a quantum design squid magnetometer .",
    "eu@xmath5cuo@xmath6 ( @xmath7 = 0 , 0.02 and 0.2 ) single crystals along ( a ) the @xmath0 plane and ( b ) the @xmath1 axis . the data of la@xmath34sr@xmath35cuo@xmath6 single crystal are also shown for comparison.,width=294 ]    figure 1 shows the temperature dependences of the thermal conductivity measured along the @xmath0 plane and the @xmath1 axis in pure lco and eu - doped lco single crystals . the undoped la@xmath11cuo@xmath6 sample , as has already been discussed in a previous paper,@xcite shows a sharp phonon peak at low temperature [ @xmath3625 k in @xmath10 and @xmath3620 k in @xmath37 and a broad magnon peak in @xmath10 at high temperature ( @xmath36270 k ) .    upon eu doping , there are drastic changes in both @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "let us first discuss the changes of the high-@xmath13 magnon peak in @xmath10 .",
    "this peak is suppressed gradually upon eu - doping , which is directly related to the suppression of the nel transition temperature by eu doping .",
    "the detailed magnetic behaviors of these samples are shown in the next subsection .",
    "the phonon peak at low temperatures shows an anomalous change with eu doping . for la@xmath34eu@xmath35cuo@xmath6 , with only 1%-eu - substitution , the phonon peak in @xmath10 is completely suppressed although the magnon peak shows only slight decrease .",
    "one natural phonon scattering process is caused by the point defects associated with dopants .",
    "however , it is found that the suppression of the phonon peak is much weaker in la@xmath34sr@xmath35cuo@xmath6 with the same amount of dopants , as shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) , which suggests that the impurity atoms themselves are not the main source of such strong phonon scattering in la@xmath34eu@xmath35cuo@xmath6 .",
    "another possible mechanism may be the magnetic scattering of phonons since eu@xmath38 ions have magnetic moments and may disturb phonons by magnetoelastic coupling.@xcite if this is the case , some magnetic field dependence of thermal conductivity is expected ( at least in the temperature region near the phonon peak where the phonon transport is most strongly suppressed with eu doping ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the field dependence of @xmath2 measured with magnetic field parallel to the @xmath1 axis or to the @xmath0 plane for this la@xmath34eu@xmath35cuo@xmath6 single crystal . in both cases ,",
    "there is no substantial magnetic field dependence up to 6 t at 12.5 k and 18.5 k. therefore , magnetic origin for the strong phonon scattering is not likely .",
    "the last possible cause of the strong suppression of the phonon peak is the phonon scattering by the structural distortions introduced by eu doping .",
    "it is known that a certain degree of eu - doping in lco is necessary to induce the structural phase transition from lto to lto2.@xcite when the doping level is too small to induce the macroscopic structural transition , it is most likely that the lto2-like tilts of the cuo@xmath22 octahedra exist locally around eu@xmath38 ions in the background of lto phase , which results in very strong lattice distortions that significantly scatter phonons . it should be noted that , since sr doping can never induce phase transition from lto to lto2/ltt , the lattice distortions in la@xmath34sr@xmath35cuo@xmath6 are expected to be much weaker .",
    "eu@xmath35cuo@xmath6 single crystal measured with magnetic field parallel to ( a ) the @xmath1 axis and ( b ) the @xmath0 plane , respectively.,width=321 ]    with increasing eu concentration , the local lto2 regions around eu@xmath38 ions are expected to percolate at low temperature and the macroscopic structural transition takes place . the cooperative tilt of cuo@xmath22 octahedra in lto2 phase would weaken the lattice distortions and the phonon scattering , which is actually observed in la@xmath39eu@xmath40cuo@xmath6 . as shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) , the phonon peak , although still very weak , reappears in la@xmath39eu@xmath40cuo@xmath6 .",
    "the eu - doping dependence of @xmath3 shows that the effect of lattice distortion related to the lto2 phase on the phonon transport is weaker in the @xmath1 axis than in the @xmath0 plane .",
    "one can see in fig .",
    "1(b ) that the phonon peak still exists in @xmath3 of la@xmath34eu@xmath35cuo@xmath6 , and the peak height is comparable to that in la@xmath34sr@xmath35cuo@xmath6 ( where the disordering of static spin stripes in the @xmath1 axis causes rather strong phonon scattering@xcite ) .",
    "however , the temperature dependence of @xmath3 in la@xmath34eu@xmath35cuo@xmath6 is too complicated ( because of a double peak feature ) to extract any detailed information of the phonon transport . nevertheless , the @xmath1-axis phonon peak is larger in la@xmath39eu@xmath40cuo@xmath6 than in la@xmath34eu@xmath35cuo@xmath6 , similar to that in the @xmath0 plane .",
    "the above results show that in lightly eu - doped lco , the structural distortions associated with the local lto2 regions strongly scatter @xmath0-plane phonons . such structural distortions and phonon",
    "scattering become weaker when the eu concentration is large enough to stabilize the macroscopic lto2 phase at low temperatures .",
    "however , compared to the pure lco , the phonon peak is strongly suppressed even in la@xmath39eu@xmath40cuo@xmath6 which has global lto2 phase .",
    "there are two possible reasons for such difference .",
    "first , it may come from the difference in phonon spectrum between lto and lto2 phases , which is , however , not very likely ; as can be seen in fig .",
    "1 , both @xmath2 and @xmath3 of la@xmath39eu@xmath40cuo@xmath6 show a step - like increase at @xmath36 130 k when the structure changes from lto to lto2 phase , which means the lto2 phase essentially has better phonon heat transport than the lto phase .",
    "another , more likely reason is simply the impurity scattering by eu dopants .",
    "it is well known that the magnetic properties of la@xmath11cuo@xmath6 are determined by the cu spins . at high temperatures , lco is essentially a two - dimensional heisenberg antiferromagnet and a weak interlayer coupling gives rise to the three - dimensional long - range nel order.@xcite in the lto - phase of lco , the spin easy axis is the @xmath41 axis and all the spins are weakly canted along the @xmath1 axis .",
    "such canted moments depend on the tilting of cuo@xmath22 octahedra ; they become weaker in the lto2 phase and disappear in the ltt phase.@xcite thus , it is helpful to study the magnetic properties for understanding the eu - doping effect on local structure .",
    "figure 3 shows the magnetic susceptibility data of eu - doped lco single crystals measured with 5000 oe field applied along the @xmath1 axis or the @xmath0 plane .",
    "the pure lco sample shows a sharp nel transition in @xmath42 and a much broader peak in @xmath43 at @xmath44 = 307 k , which originates from the af ordering of cu@xmath45 canted moments.@xcite    eu@xmath5cuo@xmath6 single crystals measured in 5000 oe field applied along ( a ) the @xmath1 axis and ( b ) the @xmath0 plane.,width=321 ]    eu - doping induces pronounced changes in the magnetic properties of la@xmath39eu@xmath40cuo@xmath6 , as shown in fig .",
    "3 . first , both @xmath42 and @xmath43 data are shifted up significantly .",
    "this additional signals apparently come from the van vleck contribution of eu@xmath38 ions , which is weakly @xmath13-dependent in @xmath42 and noticeably @xmath13-dependent in @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "( note that the van vleck term , although is independent of temperature in usual cases , can be @xmath13-dependent when the energy difference between the ground state and the excited orbital state is smaller than @xmath46 , as shown for eu@xmath11cuo@xmath6.@xcite ) second , a clear nel transition shows up in @xmath42 with lower @xmath44 ( 268 k ) compared to undoped lco , while the corresponding peak is almost smeared out in @xmath43 ( only a slight hump at @xmath44 ) because of the strong @xmath13-dependence of @xmath43 .",
    "third , another transition appears in @xmath42 at the structural transition temperature , which is due to the suppression of canted moments in the lto2 phase and the reduction of the interlayer magnetic coupling.@xcite it is not clear whether there is a corresponding transition in @xmath43 because of its strong @xmath13-dependence .",
    "the details of the magnetic structure in la@xmath39eu@xmath40cuo@xmath6 are thoroughly discussed elsewhere.@xcite it should be pointed out that the susceptibility data of the present single crystal are different from the previous report , which used polycrystalline samples and claimed that la@xmath39eu@xmath40cuo@xmath6 has the ltt structure.@xcite    for eu-1%-doping , the susceptibility data show moderate changes .",
    "first , the enhancement of both @xmath42 and @xmath43 are much smaller than those in la@xmath39eu@xmath40cuo@xmath6 .",
    "second , nel transition is only slightly shifted to a lower temperature ( @xmath44 = 304 k ) .",
    "thus , the high temperature magnetic properties do not show any drastic change upon eu - doping , which is understandable because the structural changes associated with eu doping only happen at low temperatures .",
    "this is also consistent with the weak change of the high-@xmath13 magnon peak in @xmath2 .",
    "( in contrast , the magnon peak disappears in la@xmath34sr@xmath35cuo@xmath6 ( fig .",
    "1 ) , in which the nel transition also disappears.@xcite ) third , there is no second transition in @xmath42 at @xmath36 130 k , because there is no structural phase transition in this lightly - doped sample .",
    "however , @xmath42 decreases slowly with deceasing temperature from @xmath36 150 k to 50 k and @xmath43 shows a weak hump at the same temperature region .",
    "this is in correspondence with our picture that slight eu - doping induces local lto2 regions in the lto background , although no macroscopic structural transition occurs .",

    "the data for la@xmath39eu@xmath40cuo@xmath6 are also shown for comparison .",
    "the step - like feature at @xmath36 130 k is due to the lto @xmath48 ltt and lto @xmath48 lto2 structural transition for la@xmath47eu@xmath40sr@xmath9cuo@xmath6 and la@xmath39eu@xmath40cuo@xmath6 , respectively.,width=245 ]    while eu - doping significantly suppresses the phonon peak in the non - carrier - doped lco , it shows quite different effects on the phonon heat transport of lsco .",

    "4 , in which the data for la@xmath39eu@xmath40cuo@xmath6 are also included for comparison . since there are certain amount of charge carriers doped by sr , we should separate the electronic contribution from the total thermal conductivity before discussing the mechanism for the phonon heat transport .    the electronic thermal conductivity @xmath50 and the electrical resistivity @xmath51",
    "are related by @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is called the lorenz number . in simple metals , @xmath53 is usually constant at high-@xmath13 and low-@xmath13 ( the wiedemann - franz law ) and is given by the sommerfeld value @xmath54 w@xmath55/k@xmath56 .",
    "when the electron - electron correlation becomes strong , @xmath53 becomes smaller .",
    "for yba@xmath11cu@xmath57o@xmath58 , @xmath53 has been estimated to be @xmath59 w@xmath55/k@xmath56 near @xmath24 by hirschfeld and putikka,@xcite while takenaka _",
    "@xcite estimated @xmath53 to be @xmath60 w@xmath55/k@xmath56 above @xmath24 .",
    "so there is still no consensus value of @xmath53 for cuprates . here",
    ", we roughly estimate @xmath50 of our crystals by using the sommerfeld value .",

    "we note that the zero resistance at 5 k in la@xmath47eu@xmath40sr@xmath9cuo@xmath6 is a filamentary superconducting effect , since the dc susceptibility measurement does not show any bulk superconductivity in this sample .",
    "the main panel of fig .",
    "5 shows the estimated in - plane phononic thermal conductivity @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "it can be seen that the main contribution to thermal conductivity is phononic in these samples . for the @xmath1-axis heat transport ,",
    "the electronic contribution is negligibly small because of the 2  3 orders of magnitude larger electrical resistivity in the @xmath1 axis compared to @xmath61.@xcite the experimental data for @xmath3 is nearly pure phonon conductivity .     of la@xmath12sr@xmath9cuo@xmath6 single crystal to that of la@xmath47eu@xmath40sr@xmath9cuo@xmath6 crystal",

    "the strong phonon scattering can be related to the sr dopants acted as impurities , the charge carriers , and the structural distortions associated with dynamical stripes .",
    "eu - doping in this lsco system significantly increases the low-@xmath13 phononic thermal conductivity ; clear phonon peak reappears in both @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "similar behavior in r - doped lsco was first attributed by baberski _",
    "et al._@xcite to the weakening of phonon scattering in the static stripe phase .",
    "however , their data were collected on polycrystalline samples and did not display quantitative difference between lsco and r - doped lsco .",
    "here the data on single crystals show convincing evidence for the importance of static stripes on the phonon transport . in this eu - doped lsco ,",
    "lto @xmath48 ltt structural transition takes place at @xmath36 130 k [ ref .",
    "] and results in a step - like increase of the phononic thermal conductivity in the ltt phase .",
    "an important feature is , as shown in figs .",
    "4(b ) and 5 , that la@xmath12sr@xmath9cuo@xmath6 has larger phononic thermal conductivity than la@xmath47eu@xmath40sr@xmath9cuo@xmath6 in both the @xmath0 plane and the @xmath1 axis for @xmath66 45 k , which means la@xmath47eu@xmath40sr@xmath9cuo@xmath6 has stronger phonon scattering ( which may come from eu dopants ) at high temperatures even in the ltt phase .",
    "therefore , it is more reasonable to attribute the reappearance of phonon peak in eu - doped lsco to the stabilization of stripes at low temperatures , which reduces the strong phonon scattering by the stripe fluctuations , rather than the difference of the phonon heat transport between ltt and lto phases .    by re - examining the previous thermal conductivity data for la@xmath25nd@xmath26sr@xmath9cuo@xmath6 single crystal,@xcite we find that the above feature is also present in nd - doped lsco .",
    "this means that the suppression of the phonon scattering is common to the r - doped lsco , where static charge stripes are formed .",
    "furthermore , by comparing the data of la@xmath47eu@xmath40sr@xmath9cuo@xmath6 with those of la@xmath39eu@xmath40cuo@xmath6 , which has lto2 phase without stripes , we can obtain useful information on the scattering mechanism of phonons . in figs .",
    "4(a ) and 5 , one can see that in the @xmath0 direction the phonon peak in la@xmath47eu@xmath40sr@xmath9cuo@xmath6 is larger than that in la@xmath39eu@xmath40cuo@xmath6 , although the former compound has much more dopants and charge carriers .",
    "this difference clearly shows that the ltt phase has stronger phonon transport than the lto2 phase , which overcomes the additional impurity - phonon scattering by sr dopants and charge - phonon scattering in la@xmath47eu@xmath40sr@xmath9cuo@xmath6 .",
    "however , the phonon peak in @xmath3 shows opposite trend , that is , the peak magnitude is larger in la@xmath39eu@xmath40cuo@xmath6 than in la@xmath47eu@xmath40sr@xmath9cuo@xmath6 .",
    "the additional phonon scattering in the @xmath1 axis of la@xmath47eu@xmath40sr@xmath9cuo@xmath6 is unlikely due to the sr dopants , considering their negligible effect on @xmath2 .",

    "first , the neutron experiments have already shown@xcite that the magnetic correlation length in the @xmath1 direction is very short .",
    "second , the stripe orientations have been proposed to rotate 90@xmath31 from one cuo@xmath11 plane to the nearest - neighbor plane.@xcite such strong disorder of the static stripes along the @xmath1 axis leads to rather strong phonon scattering in the @xmath1-axis transport , which is very similar to what was observed in the lightly - doped lsco.@xcite",
    "we have measured the @xmath0-plane and the @xmath1-axis thermal conductivities of la@xmath4eu@xmath5cuo@xmath6 ( @xmath7 = 0 , 0.02 and 0.2 ) and la@xmath8eu@xmath5sr@xmath9cuo@xmath6 ( @xmath7 = 0 and 0.2 ) single crystals .",
    "it is found that the low - temperature phonon heat transport shows opposite eu - doping dependence in these two systems , that is , eu - doping strongly suppresses the phonon peak in lco , while it induces the reappearance of phonon peak in lsco . in eu-1%-doped lco ,",
