    "one can find that fig .",
    "[ fig02](a ) ( for zgr-1 with a width of 24 lattice sites ) exhibits a large energy gap @xmath33 located in the interval of [ @xmath34 , @xmath35  ev , deeply underneath the fermi energy .",
    "meanwhile , two nearly flat bands lie in the gap . by projecting the local density of states of the two bands onto the lattice sites , we find that they are localized along the zigzag ribbon boundaries and thus they are edge modes , which originate from the dangling bonds along the zigzag edges , like those in zigzag ribbon of pristine graphene .",
    "as clearly presented in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] , the upper and lower edges of these zgrs are different , leading to the formation of two different edge modes . as the ribbon width increases , the energy gap above the edge modes vanishes first as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig02](b ) and the lower gap closes at a larger ribbon width as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig02](c ) .",
    "therefore , these two band gaps arise from the finite - size effect and disappear when the system size is sufficiently large .    for zgr-1",
    "as the system width increases , another observation is that the edge modes are pinned at @xmath36 but evolve with the bulk states around @xmath37 .",
    "one can also notice that , in fig .",
    "[ fig02](c ) , the band structure establishes three envelopes , labeled as  1\"-3 \" . upon larger system size , the envelopes become further enhanced with higher energy degeneracies . compared with fig .  [",
    "fig01](a ) , one reasonable explanation is that these envelopes reflect the three bands in the corresponding bulk bands . for zgr-2 ,",

    "one can see an exact mapping between the transmission coefficients in fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] and the band structures in fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] . at small system size ,",
    "all the zgrs have zero transmission coefficients at certain energy regions below the fermi level , where the dispersion relations show energy gaps . for zgr-1 , there are two zero - transmission - coefficient regions while three gaps exist in zgr-2 and zgr-3 at ribbon width ( i.e. , with 24 lattice sites in black lines ) . at system size of 52 ,",
    "the zero conducting ranges shrink in all panels of fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] .",
    "only one gap are present in the zgr-2 and zgr-3 , and two gaps still reside in the transmission spectrum of zgr-3 , shown in red lines . for a larger system with 100 lattice sites",
    ", zgr-1 has no zero transmission area in the whole energy interval and single narrow gaps appear in panels ( b ) and ( c ) of fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] .",
    "these finite - size gaps eventually disappear at even larger systems . as the ribbon width increases , transmission coefficient at the same energy increases rapidly for all systems .",
    "we also observe some oscillation behavior of @xmath38 around @xmath39 0.5  ev , which can be attributed to the band overlapping at these energies .",
    "one can deduce from fig  .[fig02 ] that , the oscillations tend to be more wild at larger system sizes , which is confirmed by our transport calculations .",
    "armchair graphene ribbons : agr-1 and agr-2 , respectively . blue rectangles show the corresponding unit cells and green dots indicate top - absorption sites .",

    "depending on the relative positions of top - absorption on the honeycomb lattice , there are two different configurations of armchair graphene nanoribbons ( agrs ) .",

    "the electronic properties of these agrs are numerically investigated and displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig05 ] . in our calculations , two ribbon widths ( 24 and 60 lattice sites )",
    "are considered for both agr-1 and agr-2 .",
    "one notices that both armchair ribbons are good conductors , similar as the zgrs",
    ". figures  [ fig05](a ) and [ fig05](b ) plot the band structures of agr-1 . apparently , there is a direct band gap at @xmath41 around @xmath42  ev . as the system size increases from 24 to 60 lattice sites , this gap becomes narrower as shown in fig .",

    "this is a much natural expectation for armchair - edged ribbons because of the valley mixture behaviour .",
    "another striking difference from zgrs is that there is less oscillation feature in the transmission spectrum of agrs , which can be attributed to the absence of band - folding from @xmath44 to @xmath8 supercells in the armchair configurations . from figs .",

    "both @xmath69 and @xmath70 are continuous functions of the electron energy as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig09](a ) .",
    "one can see that @xmath69 is rather smooth and larger than 0.8 in the focused energy regime , while the magnitude of @xmath70 changes more abruptly and exhibits a fluctuating pattern .",
    "this observation reveals that incident electrons from @xmath3 valley of pristine nanotube are less affected by the central @xmath66 armchair carbon nanotube .",

    "the calculated valley polarization @xmath85 is very small below the fermi level and grows with the increasing electron energy .",
    "@xmath85 also fluctuates like @xmath70 in the whole region , and its maximum reaches about 0.3 for our considered system .    when the length of central scattering region increases from 3 units to 6 units , @xmath69 is still smooth as plotted in fig .",

    ".  [ fig10](a ) , one can find that the valley polarization fluctuatingly grows as the applied gate voltage decreases from positive to negative . for a @xmath67 valley - field - effect - transistor with 3-unit length of the @xmath2 armchair carbon nanotube , the valley polarization can reach about 0.9 at the negative gate voltage , which indicates that the @xmath3 valley is almost fully polarized .",
    "the wide @xmath93 plateau shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10](a ) qualifies the device as a stable valley - polarized current generator that can operate in a broad gate voltage range .",
    "more importantly , @xmath85 jumps abruptly from below 0.02 to above 0.9 at @xmath94  ev , showing a great on / off ratio of this valley - field - effect - transistor .",
    "the fluctuation of @xmath85 exists at all electron energies . comparing the results for @xmath95  ev and @xmath96  ev ,",
    "obviously high valley polarization can be easily achieved when the system works at larger electron energy , which only requires @xmath97  ev to reach @xmath93 at @xmath96  ev .",
    "when increasing the length of the central regime to 6 units in the device , more fluctuations of @xmath85 are revealed in fig .",
    "[ fig10](b ) , suggesting a more effective gate modulation .",
    "but the high valley polarization plateau shrinks at all electron energies and a larger negative @xmath92 is required for @xmath93 .",
    "we also performed calculations on a @xmath48 armchair carbon nanotube system and the corresponding results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig10](c ) and [ fig10](d ) .",
    "it is found again that the device performance is independent of the diameter of the nanotubes .     of a @xmath67 armchair carbon nanotube valley - field - effect - transistor with 3 units length , in terms of the electron energy and gate voltage .",

    "the best working zone of this device is the large red triangular area highlighted in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] , where the @xmath3 valley is nearly fully polarized .",
    "the valley - field - effect - transistor has a stable output in this zone , and the on / off ratio is guaranteed by the narrow blue region adjacent to the red zone , whose valley polarization is below 0.05 .",
    "the larger the electron energy , the easier to get fully valley - polarized current .",
    "the performance of this device is the same for systems with different circumferences , as long as the energy is within the first subband of pristine armchair carbon nanotube .",
    "in conclusion , we have numerically investigated the electronic properties of typical @xmath2 graphene nanoribbon and nanotube structures .",
    "we show that all the @xmath2 nanostructures are metallic materials .",
    "both the zigzag and armchair ribbons have finite - size energy gap below the fermi energy more than 1 ev .",
    "double - degeneracy in energy levels instead of energy gaps are found in the spectra of both armchair and zigzag carbon nanotubes . in small @xmath8 carbon nanotubes , there is a large energy range showing linear dispersion , which leads to the klein tunneling - like behavior : electron transmission through the tube is quantized even in the presence of a potential barrier , regardless of the barrier length and height up to a few hundreds of mev .",
    "a valley - field - effect - transistor consisting of pristine and @xmath66 armchair carbon nanotubes is proposed , which can be used to filter fully valley - polarized current and can be tuned by applying an external gate voltage or adjusting the length of the central scattering regime .",
