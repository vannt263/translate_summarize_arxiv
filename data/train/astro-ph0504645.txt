    "the prominent absorption features blue - ward of the lyman-@xmath2  emission in the spectra of high - redshift quasars ( qsos ) are now generally believed to arise from smooth density fluctuations of a photoionised warm intergalactic medium ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this has opened up the possibility to probe the density fluctuation of matter with the flux power spectrum of qso absorption lines ( croft et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ; mcdonald et al .",
    "( 2000 ) ; gnedin & hamilton ( 2001 ) ; hui et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ; croft et al .",
    "( 2002 ) ; mcdonald et al .",
    "( 2004 ) ; viel , haehnelt & springel ( 2004 ) ) .",
    "the flux power spectrum is mainly sensitive to the slope and amplitude of the linear dark matter power spectrum for wave - numbers in the range @xmath3 ( s / km ) @xmath4 , roughly corresponding to scales 1 - 40 comoving mpc@xmath5 .",
    "we use a suite of high - resolution hydrodynamical simulations and the flux power spectrum obtained from luqas ( large sample of uves qso absorption spectra ) , together with the published flux power spectrum of croft et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , to infer the linear dark matter power spectrum at @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the idea is to rely on accurate high resolution and large box - size hydrodynamical simulations to model the bias function @xmath8 which relates the flux to the linear dark matter power spectrum : @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , we will briefly address some of the uncertainties that arise from the theoretical ( numerical ) modelling of the lyman-@xmath2  forest structures .",
    "we will then combine these estimates , in the framework of monte carlo markov chains ( @xcite ) , with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) results of wmap ( @xcite ) to investigate the following issues : _",
    "i ) _ recovery of cosmological parameters such as @xmath10 ( the power spectrum amplitude ) , @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( the spectral index and its running ) ; _ ii ) _ constraints on parameters describing slow - roll inflationary models ; _ iii ) _ constraints on dark matter particle masses and neutrinos .",
    "the luqas sample consists of 27 qso spectra taken with the ultra - violet echelle spectrograph ( uves ) on vlt .",
    "most of the spectra have been taken as part of the large eso observing programme uveslp ( p.i .",
    ": j. bergeron ) .",
    "the median redshift of the sample is @xmath6 and the total redshift path is @xmath13 .",
    "the typical signal - to - noise ratio is @xmath14 and the pixel size is 0.05  . for a more detailed description of the sample and the data reduction",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "we combine this sample with that of croft et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , which consists of 30 keck hires spectra and 23 keck lris spectra and has a median redshift of @xmath7 .",
    "these two data sets seem to be in agreement with the flux power spectrum obtained by @xcite from a large sample of low - resolution sdss spectra .",
    "although some differences between the different data sets are present , at the level of the error bars that we are going to quote , these discrepancies are not relevant . in all",
    "the data sets the systematic uncertainties are larger than the statistical errors ( @xcite ) .",
    "presently , one of the biggest source of error is due to the not very well understood numerical modelling of the lyman-@xmath2  forest ( @xcite ) .",
    "the hydro - particle - mesh ( hpm ) method is an approximate technique to simulate the low density igm ( @xcite ) and has been extensively used to recover cosmological parameters from lyman-@xmath2  forest data ( @xcite ) .",
    "this method is based on the numerical implementation of an effective potential , that mimicks gas pressure , into a particle mesh code that simulates collisionless dark matter .",
    "we decided to test the accuracy of this method in reproducing the flux power spectrum , which is the quantity that is used to infer the dark matter power spectrum , using state  of  the  art hydrodynamical simulations run with the gadget - ii code .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ f1 ] where we plot the fractional differences between the flux power spectrum of hpm simulations and the full hydrodynamical one .",
    "we can see that if the resolution ( @xmath15 ) of the hpm method increases then the differences can be as small as 5 - 10% at @xmath16 ( middle and left panels ) , in the wavenumber range of interest in the analysis ( represented by the shaded area ) . at @xmath17",
    "there are strong discrepancies even at large scales that are due to the large amount of shock - heated gas present in the full hydrodynamical simulations that can not be properly modelled with the hpm technique .",
    "the line with overplotted empty triangles represents the case in which the spectra have been scaled to match the same mean flux ( both in the hpm and full hydro runs ) , a procedure which is usually adopted by simulators .",
    "we note that this scaling determines a better but still not perfect agreement of the two flux power spectra .",
    "caution is thereby needed when using hpm simulations to infer cosmological parameters and an accurate calibration of these simulations with full hydrodynamical ones is compelling ( @xcite ) .",
    "we combined the linear dark matter power spectrum as inferred by viel , haehnelt & springel ( 2004 ) with the cmb data of wmap ( @xcite ) .",
    "the results in terms of cosmological parameters are here summarized : @xmath18 ; @xmath19 ( for models with no running , @xmath20 error bars ) ; @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( for a model that includes running ) .",
    "the data is thus consistent with a scale - free power spectrum and no running of the spectral index .    for slow - roll inflationary models we get the following constraints : @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the constraint on the tensor to scalar ratio is @xmath26 ( see @xcite for the relation between these parameters and the spectral index and its running ) .",
    "the results above are in agreement with those of the sdss collaboration ( @xcite ) .",
    "candidates of dark matter particles are generally classified according to their velocity dispersion which defines a free - streaming length . on scales smaller than the free - streaming length ,",
    "fluctuations in the dark matter density are erased and gravitational clustering is suppressed . the velocity dispersion of cold dark matter ( cdm ) particles is by definition so small that the corresponding free - streaming length is irrelevant for cosmological structure formation . that of hot dark matter , e.g. light neutrinos ( see following section ) , is only one or two orders of magnitude smaller than the speed of light , and smoothes out fluctuations in the total matter density even on galaxy cluster scales , which leads to strong bounds on their mass and density .",
    "between these two limits , there exists an intermediate range of dark matter candidates generically called warm dark matter ( wdm ) .",
    "@xcite have explored two different scenarios : pure warm dark matter models that differ from @xmath27cdm models by a suppression of power below a scale @xmath2 ( figure 2 ) ; mixed models with cdm and gravitinos ( or any warm dark matter particles that decouples with a @xmath28 , shown in figure 3 ) .",
    "we obtain a lower limit ( in the case of pure warm dark matter models ) of @xmath29  ev ( @xmath30 ) for early decoupled thermal relics and @xmath31  kev ( @xmath30 ) for sterile neutrinos ( that have never been in thermal equilibrium ) . in the case",
    "in which the gravitino density is proportional to its mass we find an upper limit @xmath32  ev ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "this translates into a bound on the scale of supersymmetry breaking , @xmath33 tev , for models of supersymmetric gauge mediation in which the gravitino is the lightest supersymmetric particle @xcite .",
    "the values we get for the parameter @xmath2 ( which is related to the scale of free streaming ) and @xmath34 are the following : @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( @xmath20 error bars ) .",
    "thereby , the concordance @xmath27cdm model is perfectly consistent with the data .",
    "we have explored constraints on the quantity @xmath37 , which is the sum of the mass of the light neutrino species . both the cmb and large - scale - structure are important tracers of neutrino mass . at the time of decoupling neutrinos",
    "are still relativistic but become non relativistic later in the evolution of the universe if their mass is sufficiently high . as for wdm , but at larger scales , neutrinos free - stream out of their potential wells , erasing perturbations on smaller scales , producing a suppression of the amplitude , and leaving a characteristic feature at the transition scale . in figure [ f4 ]",
    "we plot 2d likelihood contours for several cosmological parameters .",
    "the lines indicate the same likelihoods when marginalized over the full set of parameters while the coloured contours are the mean likelihoods .",
    "the results shown here have been obtained by using the wmap data set , the 2df galaxy power spectrum ( @xcite ) and the lyman-@xmath2  constraints of @xcite .",
    "we obtain the following values for the marginalized likelihoods : @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 ( ev ) = @xmath43 ( @xmath20 error bars and for models which do not consider the running of the spectral index and tensor contribution ) .",
    "the lyman-@xmath2  forest , the absorption by neutral hydrogen seen in the spectra of background qsos , is a powerful laboratory for cosmology .",
    "we have used two samples of high resolution high signal - to - noise qso spectra to infer the linear dark matter power spectrum at @xmath0 and at scales not probed by any other observables .",
    "the present uncertainties in the inferred values of the cosmological parameters are mainly due to the systematic errors involved in the numerical modelling of the lyman-@xmath2  forest data with hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "we have explored the differences between full hydrodynamical simulation and an approximate scheme based on the hpm approximation .",
    "we have then combined the small scales estimates of the lyman-@xmath2  forest with larger scales data sets such as the cmb and the 2df galaxy power spectrum .",
    "the error bars on cosmological parameters that can be inferred from the combined analysis of cmb and lyman-@xmath2  forest data improve by a factor two those obtained by the cmb data alone .",
    "the final results point to a value of @xmath44 and a spectral index @xmath45 ( @xmath20 error bars ) and no evidence for a running of the spectral index .",
    "these results are consistent with those obtained by the sdss collaboration @xcite .",
    "we have set constraints on the mass of a warm ( thermal ) dark matter particle to be @xmath46 ev and on the light gravitino to be @xmath47 ev ( 2@xmath48 error bars ) .",
    "further constraints on the sum of the three neutrinos can be obtained and we get : @xmath42 ( ev ) = @xmath43 ( @xmath20 error bar ) by combining wmap , 2df and lyman-@xmath2  .",

    "i thank iau for the award of a grant .",
