    "electron transport calculations in the linear response regime for a method referred to as the stationary wigner function ( swf ) method have been reported [ i. bldea and h. kppel , phys .",
    "b. * 78 * , 115315 ( 2008 ) ] , as a shorthand we will refer to their presentation as bk .",
    "in fact though , their paper is a comment on the validity of a method introduced by delaney and greer  @xcite for treating open system boundary conditions for correlated many - electron problems , or many - electron correlated scattering ( mecs )  @xcite . for reasons that will hopefully become clear",
    ", we refer to the method under discussion as mecs  @xcite .",
    "bk express several criticisms of the mecs method , but their primary objection and conclusion is    _  ... the manner in which it \" _",
    "( open system boundary conditions through the wigner function ) _  was imposed in \" _ [ p. delaney and j.c .",
    "greer , phys .",
    "* 93 * , 036805 ( 2004 ) ] _  turns out to be inappropriate .",
    "it misses the fact that , in accord with our physical understanding , the current flow is due to an asymmetric injection of electrons from reservoirs into the device , and that injected electrons are very well described by fermi distributions with different chemical potentials .",
    "moreover , as results from the analysis at the end of sec .",
    "vi \" _ ( of the bk paper ) , _  unfortunately there is no simple remedy of the swf method ; the modification of the boundary conditions in the spirit of \" _ delaney and greer _  such as to account for a nonvanishing chemical potential shift does not yield the desired improvement . \" _",
    "the conclusion in bk is reached after numerical calculations on a test system designed to model independent electron and correlated electron transport across a quantum dot .",
    "as we will demonstate , their conclusion incorrectly presumes an asymmetric injection of momentum is necessary to describe reservoirs or electrodes in quasi - equilibrium , and likewise incorrectly assumes there is no chemical potential difference when applying the open system boundary conditions with the mecs procedure .",
    "we will show that the wigner boundary conditions as expressed for mecs calculations , or equally in previous works  @xcite , _ is _ consistent with the application of a  _ non - vanishing chemical potential shift _ \" .",
    "the authors in their paper appear to be confusing the application of open boundary conditions when using either energy or momentum distributions , and we will clarify that a relative shift in energy to the reservoir energy distributions _ does not _ imply a shift for the corresponding momentum distributions emitted into a scattering region for simple models of electrode behaviour .    in sect .",
    "[ ii ] , we give a brief overview of the mecs method .",
    "this is followed in sect .",
    "[ iii ] by introduction of a resolution to the apparent conundrum expressed by bk : we analyse momentum distributions for electron reservoirs or electrodes represented by fermi - dirac distributions and observe that the momenta distributions _ do not _ change with applied voltage bias , or equivalently with a chemical potential imbalance applied between electrodes .",
    "asymmetric injection implied by bk s conclusion in relation to the momentum distributions from the electrodes is not consistent with a mecs or a landauer description of electron transport . in sect .",
    "[ iv ] , a calculation of conductance quantization for a system with the electrodes represented by parabolic energy bands in one spatial dimension is given using the mecs construction . to clearly identify how",
    "the boundary conditions can be treated in this case , electron interactions are neglected and the method reduces to a many - electron scattering problem for non - interacting electrons .",
    "this approximation has the advantage of highlighting the simplicity of the mecs formulation as well as clearly demonstrating its consistency with standard formulations of electron scattering , while avoiding issues related to specific numerical approximations or questions related to specific electronic structure implementations .",
    "the boundary conditions as formulated in mecs applied to the model reproduces the well - known result of conductance quantization .",
    "the proposal behind mecs as introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite is to constrain a many - electron wavefunction on a scattering region , or specifically , the many - electron density matrix ( dm ) @xmath0 in a manner satisfying open system boundary equations  @xcite .",
    "as open system boundary conditions are commonly expressed in the language of single particle theories , it is useful to consider the wigner transform of the one - electron reduced density matrix ( rdm ) associated with the many - electron dm @xmath1 where here the transform is written for one spatial dimension @xmath2 and @xmath3 are wigner phase space variables .",
    "the mecs approach is the recognition that open system boundary conditions can be applied to correlated systems through the one - body rdm through use of the wigner transform , allowing appropriate conditions to be enforced at the boundaries of a scattering region . in practice ,",
    "the wigner distribution function is used to constrain the momenta flow out of the electron reservoirs and into the scattering region .",
    "the momentum expection value can be written as @xmath4 eq .",
    "[ waverage ] highlights the analogy of the wigner quantum phase space distribution to a classical probability distribution function .",
    "however , unlike a classical probability distribution and as is well known  @xcite , the wigner function is not everywhere positive as a consequence of the heisenberg momentum - position uncertainty principle .",
    "however , in regions where @xmath5 behaves approximately classically , the wigner phase representation allows us to assign meaning to phrases such as  electrons in the left or right reservoir \" ,  momentum of an electron emitted from a reservoir \" , or ",
    "a reservoir is locally in equilibrium \" . within this context ,",
    "the net momentum flow out of the left electrode is approximated as @xmath6 and similarly for the right electrode @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are appropriately chosen .",
    "clearly this approximation is dependent upon how well @xmath5 describes a classical probability distribution function . for metal electrodes , where electrons can be well approximated by the free electron model",
    ", this assumption is usually justified .",
    "it is also noteworthy that the wigner reduced one - particle function , as a function of energy defined in the wigner phase space , tends rapidly toward the fermi - dirac distribution with increasing number of particles in a confining potential  @xcite .    in our calculations to date , three - dimensional electrodes are considered  @xcite . to simplify the analysis ,",
    "@xmath5 is integrated over the in - plane coordinates within a cross section of the electrodes .",
    "the net momentum flow out of both electrodes is constrained to this equilibrium ( @xmath10 ) value  @xcite . to consider this procedure further",
    ", we examine models of electrode behaviour in quantum transport theories .",
    "in fig .  [ fig1]a ) , a pictorial representation of open system boundary conditions is shown for electrodes described by two parabolic energy bands ( free - electrons with effective mass @xmath11 in one dimension and for a fermi - dirac distribution at temperature @xmath12 ) .",
    "the energy levels @xmath13 in the left and right electrodes are filled to the fermi energy @xmath14 ; similarly momentum states are filled to the fermi momentum @xmath15 . in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) , a potential energy difference is introduced between the left and right electrodes shifting the bottom of the energy bands with respect to each other by an amount denoted @xmath16 .",
    "this results in a shift to the energies in the right electrode by @xmath17 ( a symmetric split in the voltage between electrodes does not alter our discussion ) .",
    "the shift of the right electrode energy states describes the chemical potential imbalance between the reservoirs and will necessarily be accompanied by a voltage drop , or equivalently an electric field across the scattering region . in fig .",
    "[ fig1]c ) , the momentum distributions corresponding to fermi - dirac energy distributions with and without applied voltage in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) and fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) , respectively , are shown .",
    "the _ same _ momentum distributions are obtained with or without application of a voltage difference between the left and right electrodes .",
    "it also follows that similar considerations hold for the case of non - zero temperature .",
    "it is important to highlight at this point that the mecs proposal  @xcite for treating quantum electronic transport is completely compatible with this picture of boundary conditions on the electrode regions .",
    "when working with the one - electron rdm obtained from a correlated @xmath18-electron density matrix , it is not possible to unambiguously define single electron energies .",
    "it is therefore of advantage to constrain the total incoming momentum to model the action of the electrodes while determining the correlated many - electron density matrix on the scattering region . as the incoming momentum distributions are the same for electrodes in equilibrium or in local equilibrium , constraining the net momentum flow from the electrodes is not sufficient to drive the electrodes away from equilibrium with respect to each other .",
    "it is standard practice in many electron transport methods , including non - equilibrium green s function ( negf ) techniques , to introduce an external electric field to model the action of the electrodes on the scattering region . to understand the role of the external field in transport calculations , it is useful to consider the sketch of two metallic electrodes as presented in fig .",
    "a simple band or independent particle model is a remarkably good approximation to the electronic structure of metals allowing our discussion of the parabolic bands to be extended directly to consideration of realistic models of metal electrodes . within fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the fact that the two electrodes are not in equilibrium with respect to one another is denoted by the different left @xmath19 and right @xmath20 chemical potentials .",
    "the chemical potential imbalance introduces a difference in the charge density between the left and right electrodes .",
    "however , electrostatic screening is efficient in metals and for the quasi - equilibrium regions of the electrodes , the electric field is zero within the electrodes or equivalently , the voltage is constant within a short distance into the metal electrodes .",
    "thus all of the voltage drop is across the scattering region plus the screening length into the electrodes .",
    "typical screening lengths in metals are of the order of 0.1 nm .",
    "hence any charge imbalance in the electrodes resides at the surface of the metal and the opposite polarity of the surface induced charges between the electrodes gives rise to an electric field across the region situated between the electrodes ; a situation depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] as field lines between the electrode surfaces . in most transport calculations , charges in the electrode and scattering regions",
    "are solved for self - consistently allowing a molecular tunnel junction to polarize in response to this external electric field . in mecs ,",
    "charges re - arrange due to minimization of the energy with respect to the many - electron wavefunction subject to the open system boundary conditions and the external electric field .",
    "the voltage can then be extracted as the combined field arising from the applied field and polarized charge distribution in the scattering region ; see for example  @xcite .",
    "the model of electrode behaviour we are describing is consistent with other formulations of quantum electronic transport . in this regard ,",
    "it is worthwhile to mention the work of mclennan , lee and datta  @xcite and in particular their fig .",
    "3 . as pointed out by the authors , a change in the chemical potential in the electrodes is accompanied by a shift in the electrostatic voltage . in a metal ,",
    "the case considered for mecs calculations to date , the chemical potential and electrostatic voltage changes are nearly identical and the effect of the applied voltage can be accounted for as a shift in the electrode bands with respect to each other . in the linear response regime ,",
    "the shift due to the electrostatic voltage is sometimes neglected  @xcite but formally should be included as indicated schematically in our fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and in mclennan _",
    "et al _ s fig .",
    "the point which we would like to emphasize is that the presence of voltage drop on the scattering regions ensures that the single electron energies in the electrodes are shifted by the applied voltage , but does not alter the momentum distributions emitted from the electrodes .",
    "the conclusion in bk that an asymmetric injection of electrons is needed to obtain a current is incorrect , if injection refers to incoming electron momentum distributions , i.e. ` current injected ' from the electrodes .",
    "what is required is asymmetric scattering for injected electrons , and this is provided for by the asymmetric electric field profile or equivalently , the chemical potential imbalance generated across a molecular tunnel junction .",
    "mecs was originally formulated for interacting many - electron systems with a hamiltonian operator given as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the sum of @xmath18 one - electron kinetic energy operators , @xmath23 is the sum of the external one - electron potentials and @xmath24 is the sum of electron - electron interactions on the scattering region  @xcite . as mentioned , with the mecs approach an external electric field can be applied to model the chemical potential imbalance between the reservoirs and this term may be included into @xmath23 .",
    "to arrive at a single particle model to be used in our analysis , the electron - electron interactions are ` switched ' off and , for simplicity , all other external potentials other than the chemical potential imbalance between the electrodes are also ` switched ' off .",
    "as electron - electron interactions are not treated , the resulting many - electron system consists of @xmath18 non - interacting electrons each described by a single electron hamiltonian operator .",
    "of course , there is no advantage to apply the mecs method to a non - interacting electron model , but we demonstrate in this case that the mecs method is consistent with the usual formulation of quantum mechanical scattering .",
    "we consider a scattering region of length @xmath25 $ ] in the absence of a potential and write plane wave eigenfunctions on the scattering region @xmath26 left going and right going states are filled to a fermi momentum @xmath27 . in the absence of the application of a voltage , the current is given simply as @xmath28=-\\frac{e\\hbar}{m^*l}\\left ( \\sum_{n_l=1}^{n_f } k_{n_l}-\\sum_{n_r=1}^{n_f } k_{n_r}\\right)=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath29 and @xmath30 denote states associated with the left and right electrodes , respectively .",
    "in one dimension , the electron current and current density are equivalent , and the factor @xmath31 indicates our choice of normalization .",
    "the model consists of left and right propagating plane wave states with the net current summing to zero . in this representation ,",
    "the density matrix is diagonal with @xmath32 for both @xmath33 and @xmath34 otherwise .",
    "this allows the density matrix to be constructed from the first @xmath35 states incoming from the left and right to be written as @xmath36                      + \\frac{1}{l } \\sum_{n=1}^{n_f } \\exp \\left [ -ik_n(x - x^\\prime ) \\right].\\ ] ] introducing the wigner transformation term by term , the resulting wigner distribution function is readily found to be @xmath37                                         = \\frac{2\\pi}{l } \\sum_{n=1}^{n_f } \\delta ( p_n -\\hbar|k_n| )                                          + \\frac{2\\pi}{l } \\sum_{n=1}^{n_f } \\delta ( p_n + \\hbar|k_n|),\\ ] ] with @xmath38 the dirac delta function . strictly speaking , as we consider wavefunctions that are only non - zero on the scattering region ,",

    ", a potential step is introduced at @xmath41 to drive the system out of equilibrium and allow for a net current flow .",
    "the exact form of the scattering potential is not critical to the following argument , but for ease of presentation we assume that the potential is varied over a small region @xmath42 allowing us to approximate the difference between the left and right electrodes as a potential energy step . for this case , the solutions to the one - electron schrdinger equation may be written in scattering form @xmath43 for spatially varying potentials centered at @xmath41 satisfying @xmath42 , the asymptotic wavefunctions will likewise satisfy the scattering form and the following development remains valid with minor modification . by implication ,",
    "the energies for electrons entering the scattering region from the right are shifted by an amount given by the scattering potential height @xmath44 .",
    "however the incoming momenta , as previously discussed , are unchanged .",
    "we apply a voltage greater than the level spacings at the bottom of the reservoir conduction band where the energy density of states is greatest . with the introduction of the potential , the model for electrons entering from the left",
    "is the one - dimensional quantum mechanical scattering problem with a step - up potential . for electrons entering the scattering region from the right ,",

    "note that @xmath47 and @xmath48 for our example .",
    "time reversal symmetry requires that the left and right transmission functions for a given single particle energy @xmath49 are equal @xmath50 , but the energies for the left and right states of equal momentum _ are not _ equal in the presence of a voltage .",

    "it can be shown that the wigner transform of the reduced density matrix constructed from the scattering wave functions satisfies the same open system boundary conditions as the zero voltage ( plane - wave states ) solution in the large @xmath40 limit and as we will demonstrate , approximately for finite values of @xmath40 typically used in numerical studies .",
    "the electron reservoirs in this case are the regions outside of the central scattering site .",
    "the density matrix with @xmath52 remains diagonal and we can again consider the wigner transform term by term @xmath53 where now @xmath54 are wavefunctions of the scattering form eq .  [ scattform ] on @xmath25 $ ] .",

    "[ scattw ] @xmath2 is the amplitude of the reflected component of the scattering wavefunction and the normalization is fixed to that of an incoming plane wave .",

    "as voltage is applied , the incoming electron distributions are not exactly equal to the @xmath10 distribution , but agreement is very close particularly for states near @xmath15 which provide the largest contributions to the current .",
    "the outflow of momentum is changed as a result of the scattering off the potential barrier and this difference between the equilibrium ( @xmath10 ) and non - equilibrium distributions ( @xmath64 ) reflects the difference in chemical potential between the electrodes . in fig .",

    "if the scattering states with @xmath52 are constrained to satisfy the wigner function determined from the @xmath10 wavefunctions , the correct solution to the one electron hamiltonian in the presence of a potential on the scattering region will be obtained in the large @xmath40 limit and approximately for smaller values of @xmath40 .",
    "indeed it is observed that in the single particle case , constraining the incoming momentum inflow via the wigner function implies solving the one - electron schrdinger equation for a _ specific _ value of incoming momentum @xmath71 , and otherwise results in the standard textbook presentation of one - dimensional quantum mechanical scattering .",

    "the first point of our presentation is that the mecs approach is consistent with a landauer description of electron transport .",
    "bk s conclusion ascribes the failure of their calculations for a single particle and a correlated model to the mecs formulation of boundary conditions . the analysis of sect .",
    "[ iii ] highlights this is not the case ; based on an analytical model , the use of the mecs formulation is consistent with a scattering approach to electron transport .",
    "the advantage of an analysis based upon an analytical model is that it avoids issues associated with linear response approximations , perturbation theory , variational methods in a finite basis , specific implementations of electronic structure , or other numerical approximations , thereby allowing a clear focus on the physical assumptions made when using the method . in sect .",
    "[ iv ] , we continue in this vein and demonstrate how the mecs formulation reproduces conductance quantization in a system of non - interacting electrons scattering off a potential barrier .",
    "we would also like to touch upon some formal points raised in the bk work .",
    "the authors criticize the use of a configuration expansion to describe transport problems .",
    "we note that it is shown in several works that a properly designed variational calculation can provide accurate properties governing electron transport such as electronic spectra  @xcite with compact expansion vectors  @xcite .",
    "the variational structure of mecs calculations performed to date has also been noted by bk and we believe misinterpreted . using a variational approximation to the wavefunction does not result in an exact eigenfunction of the system hamiltonian but rather the best approximation using the functional @xmath88 for the approximating function @xmath89 and subject to the application of the constraint conditions . as a consequence",
    ", it is well known that integrated quantities such as the energy may be better approximated compared to local properties such as spin density or electron current density .",
    "hence in previous mecs calculations the possibility to introduce constraints to enforce current conservation on a scattering region was introduced .",
    "however , this is a numerical feature related to the variational nature of the calculations and the application of the open system boundary conditions does not imply the violation of current conservation contrary to a supposition in bk .",
    "we have already noted the origin of the current variations from variational calculations .",
    "it also well known that , for example , perturbation theories do not conserve many physically conserved quantities , including electronic current .",
    "considerable care is needed in defining finite expansions that are current conserving  @xcite .",
    "hence we maintain the bk have incorrectly ascribed to mecs the curent oscillations they calculate in a tight binding model within linear response to the boundary conditions applied within mecs .    as a final point , the application of the wigner constraints in the case of a one - dimensional problem as we have introduced and as attempted for a tight - binding linear chain in bk requires particular care in the following sense .",
    "formally , for a single electron model of metallic electrodes ( a reasonable assumption ) , the density matrix decays as @xmath90 with @xmath91 the spatial dimension of the electrode .",
    "how one decides to treat this long range behaviour influences the boundary conditions .",
    "another way to express this is that the density matrix does not satisfy kohn s principle of ` nearsightedness ' for these examples  @xcite , whereas in three - dimensional models of metal electrodes  @xcite the density matrix decays within typically less than 0.5 nm  @xcite thereby greatly simplifying the introduction of open system boundary conditions through use of the wigner function .",
    "the decay of the density matrix in three - dimensional metallic electrodes helps in the calculation of the equilibrium ( @xmath92=0 ) wigner function with small explicit electrode regions , without coupling between the electrodes or coupling the electrode equilibrium regions to the scattering region .",
    "we have shown that the mecs boundary conditions and introduction of a chemical potential imbalance between electrodes reduces to the correct single particle limit , and hence the claim in bk for the failure of the mecs boundary conditions to reproduce conductance quantization is incorrect .",
    "the model analysis provided reveals that a failure of a calculation attempting to apply the boundary conditions using the wigner function for momentum distributions for this or related models can not be attributed to a failure of the mecs formulation .",
    "we have also provided an analysis on both the formulation of many - electron scattering using the wigner function boundary conditions , and touched upon issues related to the numerical implementation of the model .",
    "we will present a similar analysis on more realistic models of atomic and molecular scale systems and consider the effect of various numerical approximations on mecs transport calculations in future work .",
    "the use of swf as terminology is misleading in the sense bk have introduced it : the time - independence of the wigner distributions used to define the electrons within electrode regions has no more or no less significance than the time - independence of the fermi - dirac distributions used to constrain boundary conditions in the landauer and related descriptions of electron transport .",
