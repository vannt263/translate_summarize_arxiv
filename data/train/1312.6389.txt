    "excitation energy transfer ( eet ) has been continuously attracting interest ever since the early studies of frster on fluorescence depolarization of chromophores in solution .",
    "@xcite frster theory owes its success to the establishment of a simple relation between the rate of eet and experimentally observable monomeric absorption and emission spectra.@xcite it is based on the dipole approximation to the coulomb interaction of electronic transition densities .",
    "this approximation , of course , breaks down once the extension of the transition density is of the order of the distance between the monomers . among the more prominent examples",
    "are the light - harvesting antennae of purple bacteria with their closely packed bacteriochlorophyll ring systems , @xcite the nanoscale man - made systems such as molecular aggregates @xcite or extended organic conjugated polymer system.@xcite close proximity of the chromophores comes along not only with the breakdown of the dipole approximation , but with the need to go beyond a second - order rate description , taking into account delocalization of the excitation state over several monomer units.@xcite    the theoretical description of eet rests on the model of the frenkel exciton hamiltonian , which starts from the separation of the total system into monomeric subunits coupled by the coulomb interaction.@xcite the frenkel exciton hamiltonian can be parameterized in several ways .",
    "foremost , its simple structure facilitates an empirical approach , i.e. fitting to experimental data such as different spectroscopic signals ( see , e.g. ref . ) . besides semiempirical methods , @xcite in particular time - dependent density functional theory ( td - dft ) enjoys great popularity @xcite because it often gives a reasonable compromise between accuracy and numerical efficiency ( for a critical overview see ref . ) . in general ,",
    "computational approaches can be divided into two categories : first , the aggregate is being viewed as composed of coulomb - coupled monomers . obtaining electronic transitions energies for the monomers and their coulomb couplings an arbitrary aggregate can be formed .",
    "@xcite second , the aggregate is treated as a super - molecule , usually restricted to a representative dimer .",
    "based on the splitting between excited states and their dependence on the dimer geometry , coupling parameters can be deduced .",
    "@xcite    several approaches have been developed for the calculation of the coulomb matrix elements .",
    "scholes and coworkers @xcite have proposed the tdc ( transition density cube ) method , which coarse - grains the configuration space for integration of the transition densities . this way the interaction is expressed as a sum over pairs of tdcs .",
    "an alternative was provided by renger and coworkers .",
    "@xcite their tresp ( transition charge from electrostatic potential ) method employs atomic partial charges in the summation of the coulomb interaction .",
    "these partial charges are obtained by fitting the electrostatic potential of the monomeric transition densities . as compared with the tdc method this approach has the advantage",
    "that numerically converged results can be obtained using some tens of partial charges only ( for applications , see , e.g. , refs . ) .",
    "still another approach focusses on the direct implementation of the calculation of the coulomb coupling utilizing integration and pre - screening tools available in quantum chemistry packages.@xcite    here we propose and test a new and efficient method for calculation of coulomb couplings that is based on the time - dependent density functional based tight - binding method ( td - dftb).@xcite this scheme may be seen as an approximate version of td - dft , in which computational savings are obtained by the use of a minimal but accurate atomic orbital basis and the consistent application of approximations for relevant two - electron integrals.@xcite these simplifications lead to a significant speed - up with respect to full td - dft calculations and allow the treatment of systems with several hundred atoms .",
    "in contrast to semi - empirical methods for the calculation of electronic excited states , like for example the zindo@xcite method , td - dftb does not rely on free or empirical parameters which ensures a higher transferability .",
    "so far the method has been applied to such different systems as organic molecules,@xcite semiconductor nanoparticles,@xcite amorphous chalcogenides,@xcite and biological chromophores.@xcite the accuracy achieved is close to the one of the parental td - dft method , which also means that known deficiencies , like the erroneous description of charge - transfer excited states , are inherited from the latter .    the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : theory ] we give a brief account on the frenkel exciton hamiltonian as well as on td - dftb .",
    "this will lead to the formulation of intermonomeric coulomb couplings in terms of mulliken transition charges of td - dftb .",
    "applications will be presented in section  [ sec : appl ] , first to the formaldehyde oxime dimer , a simple model for which comparison with regular td - dft is feasible , and second to a perylene bisimide dimer .",
    "results are summarized in section  [ sec : res ] . in the appendix",
    "we give an alternative derivation of the coulomb coupling , based on a coupled systems partitioning .",
    "the hamiltonian of a molecular aggregate of @xmath0 monomers can be written in terms of intramolecular and intermolecular parts : @xmath1 here , @xmath2 describes the individual monomers while @xmath3 is the interaction between pairs of monomers counted by the indices @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "they can be separated into coulomb and exchange contributions.@xcite the latter will be neglected what is justified for not to small intermolecular distances ( see below ) .",
    "this results in the following form for the aggregate hamiltonian : @xmath6 here @xmath7 denotes the electronic state @xmath8 of monomer @xmath4 and @xmath9 is the respective energy . using the generalized molecular charge density with the nuclei being at @xmath10 having charge @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) @xmath13 with the electronic density @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the one - particle electron density operator and @xmath16 the number of electrons of monomer @xmath4 .",
