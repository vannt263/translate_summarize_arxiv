    "a precise measurement of the excitation curve of narrow charmonium resonances depends both on the detection technique ( event statistics , detector efficiency ) and on the properties of the beam - energy spectrum . in @xmath5annihilations ,",
    "the beam - energy spread is substantially larger than the resonance width .",
    "the bes collaboration at bepc published two measurements of the @xmath0  width in @xmath5  collisions at center - of - mass energies between 3.67  gev and 3.71  gev  @xcite .",
    "the combination @xmath6  was recently measured by the babar collaboration at pep - ii using initial - state radiation  @xcite . in @xmath7",
    "annihilations , the event statistics are lower , but one can take advantage of stochastically cooled antiproton beams , with fwhm energy spreads of 0.40.5  mev in the center - of - mass frame , to measure the width directly from the excitation curve generated by scanning the beam across the resonance .",
    "fermilab experiment e760 measured the widths of the @xmath8  and @xmath0mesons  @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty was dominated by event statistics and statistical fluctuations in the beam position measurements .",
    "a sizeable systematic uncertainty was due to the measurement of the beam - energy spectrum .",
    "in this paper , we present results obtained in @xmath7  annihilations by fermilab experiment e835 from data collected during the year 2000 run .",
    "a new scanning technique , together with higher event statistics , improvements in the beam position measurement and momentum - spread analysis , allow us to reach the highest precision to date .",
    "the main features of the experiment are summarized here .",

    "@xcite .    in experiment e835 ,",
    "antiprotons circulating in the antiproton accumulator intersect an internal hydrogen gas - jet target .",
    "the beam is cooled and decelerated to scan charmonium resonances .",
    "the operation of the accumulator for e835 is described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the e835 detector is a nonmagnetic spectrometer designed to extract , from a large hadronic background , electron - positron pairs of high invariant mass as a signature of charmonium formation .",
    "the apparatus has full acceptance in azimuth , with a cylindrical central system and a planar forward system .",
    "the central detector system includes three segmented hodoscopes , straw - tube and scintillating - fiber trackers , a threshold gas cherenkov counter , and an electromagnetic lead - glass calorimeter . in the forward direction , a veto counter and a planar lead - glass electromagnetic calorimeter",
    "are placed .",
    "the event selection is described in detail in our paper on @xmath0  branching ratios  @xcite .",
    "the main hardware trigger requires two charged tracks , each defined by a coincidence between two hodoscope counters , with at least one of the two particles tagged as an electron or positron by a signal in the corresponding cherenkov cell .",
    "in addition , two energy deposits that are roughly back - to - back in azimuth are required in the central calorimeter , with an invariant mass greater than a given fraction of the center - of - mass energy .",
    "a preliminary off - line selection requires that all @xmath5  candidates have an invariant mass greater than 2.6  gev .",
    "a maximum - likelihood method called ` electron weight ' rejects backgrounds , mainly photon conversions and dalitz decays of the pion , that mimic electron or positron tracks in the detector .",
    "it is based on pulse height in the hodoscopes and in the cherenkov counter , and on the shape of the electromagnetic shower in the central calorimeter .",
    "the processes @xmath1 and @xmath2 are finally selected using kinematic fits requiring a @xmath9 probability greater than  @xmath10 . the overall efficiency , including detector acceptance , hardware trigger , and off - line selections , is about 40% ( see section  [ sec : results ] ) , while background contamination is only 0.1% for the @xmath5  channel and 1% for the inclusive channel .",
    "two scans of the @xmath0  resonance were performed , in january  2000 ( 47  hours of data taking ) and in june  2000 ( 21  hours ) . for each run",
    "@xmath11 , the luminosity  @xmath12 and the number of selected events  @xmath13 are shown in tables  [ tab : stack01 ] and  [ tab : stack29 ] .",
    "the resonance parameters are determined from a maximum - likelihood fit to the excitation curve . for each data - taking run ( subscript  @xmath11 ) , we assume that the average number of observed events  @xmath14 in each channel depends on a breit - wigner cross section @xmath15and on the center - of - mass energy distribution , @xmath16 , as follows : @xmath17 ,    \\label{eq : mu}\\ ] ] where  @xmath18 is the center - of - mass energy , @xmath19 is the detector efficiency , @xmath12 is the integrated luminosity , and @xmath20  is a constant background cross section .",
    "the integral is extended over the energy acceptance of the machine .",
    "the spin - averaged breit - wigner cross section for a spin-@xmath21 resonance of mass  @xmath22 and width  @xmath23 formed in @xmath7  annihilations is @xmath24 @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the ( anti)proton mass and spin , while  @xmath27 and  @xmath28 are the partial resonance widths for the entrance ( @xmath7 , in our case ) and exit channels .",
    "the breit - wigner cross section is corrected for initial - state radiation to obtain @xmath15  @xcite : @xmath29 where the second form is more suitable for numerical integration and @xmath30 is the semiclassical collinearity factor  @xcite , equal to 0.00753 at the @xmath0 .",
    "the resonance mass  @xmath22 , width  @xmath23 , ` area '  @xmath31 and the background cross section  @xmath20  are left as free parameters in the maximization of the log - likelihood function @xmath32 , where  @xmath33 are poisson probabilities of observing  @xmath34 events when the mean is  @xmath35 .",
    "both channels @xmath1 and @xmath2 are fit simultaneously to the same mass and width .",
    "each channel is allowed its own area and background cross section .",
    "the center - of - mass energy distribution @xmath36 is critical for width and area measurements .",
    "we summarize here the concepts that are essential for the following discussion . more details can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the revolution - frequency distribution of the antiprotons is measured by detecting the schottky noise signal generated by the coasting beam .",
    "the signal is sensed by a 79-mhz longitudinal schottky pickup and recorded on a spectrum analyzer .",
    "an accuracy of 0.05  hz is achieved on a revolution frequency of 0.63  mhz , over a wide dynamic range in intensity ( 60  dbm ) .",
    "the beam is slightly bunched by an rf cavity operating at @xmath37 , the second harmonic ( @xmath38 ) of the revolution frequency .",
    "the beam is bunched both for stability ( ion clearing ) and for making the beam position monitors ( bpms ) sensitive to a portion of the beam .",
    "therefore , recorded orbits refer to particles bunched by the rf system , and their revolution frequency is @xmath39 .",
    "the bunched - beam revolution frequency  @xmath40   is usually close to the average revolution frequency of the beam .",
    "each orbit consists of 48 horizontal and 42 vertical readings . as a result of hardware and software improvements ,",
    "these readings are much less noisy than e760 s  @xcite , as discussed later in the uncertainty estimates .    from the bpm readings and the accumulator lattice model",
    ", we can accurately calculate differences @xmath41 in the length of one orbit and another .",
    "the main systematic uncertainties come from bpm calibrations , from bend - field drifts , and from neglecting second - order terms in the orbit length . using the dispersion function from the lattice model ,",
    "the gains of the high - dispersion bpms can be measured by varying the beam energy at constant magnetic field .",
    "they show calibration errors between 3% and 15% .",
    "their systematic effect on  @xmath41  is about 0.03  mm .",
    "contributions from calibration errors in the low - dispersion bpms are harder to evaluate , but they should be comparable .",
    "bend - field drifts ( due to temperature variations , for instance ) appear in the orbit - length calculation as changes in momentum . for the @xmath0  scans",
    ", their contribution translates into an uncertainty in  @xmath41  of about 0.04  mm .",
    "the second - order terms depend on the derivatives of the vertical and horizontal orbit slope differences with respect to the reference orbit as well as the slopes of the reference orbit itself .",
    "an explicit assessment of these terms is not possible , because there are not enough bpms to measure slopes everywhere around the ring . under reasonable assumptions",
    ", one would get an error of about 0.005  mm .",
    "a test was performed to estimate the accuracy in  @xmath41 .",
    "the systematic uncertainty is evaluated by using a january 2000 @xmath0  orbit to predict the length of a very different @xmath0  orbit of known length from august 1997 , when the machine lattice was also quite different .",
    "the difference between the known length and the predicted length is 0.05  mm out of 474  m. since orbits and lattices for the runs used in this analysis are much closer to each other , this is taken as the systematic uncertainty in @xmath41  from the beam - energy calculation for these runs .",
    "the absolute length  @xmath42 of an orbit can be calculated from a reference orbit of length @xmath43 : @xmath44 .",
    "the calibration of  @xmath43 is done by scanning a charmonium resonance ( the @xmath0  itself in this analysis ) the mass of which is precisely known from the resonant - depolarization method in @xmath5experiments  @xcite . for particles in the bunched portion of the beam ( rf bucket ) , the relativistic parameters  @xmath45and  @xmath46  are calculated from their velocity @xmath47 , from which the center - of - mass energy  @xmath18 of the @xmath7  system is calculated : @xmath48 .",
    "( the superscript rf is omitted from orbit lengths because they always refer to particles in the rf bucket . ) in the charmonium region , this method yields good accuracies on  @xmath18 .",
    "for instance , @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) and @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) at the @xmath0  ( @xmath8 ) .    for width and area determinations ,",
    "energy differences are crucial , and they must be determined precisely . in our usual data - taking , where we keep the beam near the central orbit of the accumulator , a particular run is chosen as the reference ( subscript  0 ) .",
    "energy differences between the reference run and other runs in the scan ( subscript  @xmath11 ) , for particles in the rf bucket , are simply @xmath53 within the energy range of a resonance scan , these differences are largely independent of the choice of  @xmath43 . for this reason ,",
    "the absolute energy calibration is irrelevant for width and area measurements .",
    "only uncertainties coming from  @xmath41  are considered .",
    "once the energy  @xmath54 for particles in the rf bucket is known , the complete energy distribution is obtained from the schottky spectrum using the relation between frequency differences and momentum differences at constant magnetic field : @xmath55 where  @xmath56 is the energy - dependent phase - slip factor of the machine , which is one of the parameters governing synchrotron oscillations .",
    "( the dependence of  @xmath56 on beam energy is chosen during lattice design , as described in ref .",
    "@xcite ; the variation of  @xmath56 within a scan can be neglected . ) in terms of the center - of - mass energy , @xmath57 within a run , rf frequencies , beam - frequency spectra , and bpm readings are updated every few minutes .",
    "frequency spectra are then translated into center - of - mass energy through eq .",
    "[ eq : dw ] , weighted by luminosity and summed , to obtain the luminosity - weighted normalized energy spectra  @xmath36 for each data - taking run .",
    "the phase - slip factor is usually determined from the synchrotron frequency . in our case , this determination has a 10% uncertainty coming from the bolometric rf voltage measurement  @xcite . at the @xmath0 ,",
    "the synchrotron - frequency method yields a phase - slip factor @xmath58 .",
    "the resonance width and area are affected by a systematic error due to the uncertainty in  @xmath56 .",
    "usually , the resonance width and area are positively correlated with the phase - slip factor .",
    "a larger  @xmath56 implies a narrower energy spectrum , as described in eq .",
    "[ eq : dw ] . as a consequence",
    ", the fitted resonance will more closely resemble the measured excitation curve , yielding a larger resonance width .",
    "for our scan at the central orbit ( stack  1 ) , the 10% uncertainty in  @xmath56 translates into a systematic uncertainty of about 18% in the width and 2% in the area .",
    "for precision measurements , one needs a better estimate of the phase - slip factor or determinations that are independent of  @xmath56 , or both . in e760 ,",
    "the ` double scan ' technique was used  @xcite .",
    "it yielded  @xmath56 with an uncertainty of 6% at the @xmath0and width determinations largely independent of the phase - slip factor , but it had the disadvantage of being operationally complex .    here",
    "we describe a new method of ` complementary scans ' to achieve a similar precision on  @xmath56 and arbitrarily small correlations between resonance parameters and phase - slip factor ; the technique is also operationally simpler .",
    "the resonance is scanned once on the central orbit , as described above .",
    "a second scan is then performed at constant magnetic bend field ( most of stack  29 , runs 58185831 ) .",
    "the energy of the beam is changed by moving the longitudinal stochastic - cooling pickups .",
    "the beam moves away from the central orbit , and the range of energies is limited but appropriate for narrow resonances .",
    "since the magnetic field is constant , beam - energy differences can be calculated independently of  @xmath41 , directly from the revolution - frequency spectra and the phase - slip factor , according to eq .",
    "[ eq : dw ] .",
    "a pivot run is chosen ( 5827 in our case , subscript  @xmath59 ) .",
    "the rf frequency of this run is used as a reference to calculate the energy for particles in the rf bucket in other runs .",
    "these particles have revolution frequency  @xmath60 and the energy is calculated as follows : @xmath61 for the scan at constant magnetic field , this relation is used instead of eq .",
    "[ eq : dw_dl ] .",
    "once the energy for particles at @xmath60 is known , the full energy spectrum within each run is obtained from eq .",
    "[ eq : dw ] , as usual . , instead of using eq .",
    "[ eq : dw_eta ] first and then eq .  [ eq : dw ] .",
    "the two - step procedure is chosen because it is faster to rescale the energy spectra than to re - calculate them from the frequency spectra when fitting for  @xmath56 .",
    "numerically , the difference between the two calculations is negligible ( less than 0.2  kev ) .",
    "moreover , the two - step procedure exposes how the width depends on  @xmath56 . ]    using this alternative energy measurement , the width and area determined from scans at constant magnetic field are negatively correlated with  @xmath56 . the increasing width with increasing",
    "@xmath56 is still present , as it is in scans at nearly constant orbit .",
    "but the dominant effect is that a larger  @xmath56 brings the energy points in the excitation curve closer to the pivot point , making the width smaller . in the case of stack  29 ,",
    "a 10% increase in  @xmath56 implies a -10% variation in both width and area .",
    "the different dependence of the width on  @xmath56 in the two separate scans is shown as two crossing curves in figure  [ fig : crossing ] .",
    "( statistical errors , @xmath62 for both curves , are not shown . )",
    "the constant - orbit and the constant - field scan can be combined .",
    "the resulting width has a dependence on  @xmath56 that is intermediate between the two .",
    "an appropriate luminosity distribution can make the resulting curve practically horizontal .",
    "the combined measurement is dominated by the statistical uncertainty ( @xmath63 , in this case ; not shown in the plot ) .",
    "moreover , thanks to this complementary behavior , the width , area and phase - slip factor can be determined in a maximum - likelihood fit where  @xmath56 is also a free parameter .",

    "the constant - field scan efficiency is @xmath69 ; differences in detection efficiency between the two scans are accounted for by the parameter @xmath70 .",
    "they are due to a different configuration of the tracking system , which does not affect the @xmath5  channel .",

    "the fitted value of  @xmath56 in table  [ tab : results ] is consistent with the one determined from the synchrotron frequency ( section  [ sec : beam_energy ] ) .",
    "the relative uncertainty in the phase - slip factor ( 6% ) is equal to that from the e760 double scans  @xcite .",
    "possible statistical and systematic sources of uncertainty in the width and area are considered . as discussed in section  [ sec : beam_energy ] , each beam spectrum is a luminosity - weighted sum of individual energy distributions within each run .",
    "statistical fluctuations of the bpm readings produce random variations of the measured  @xmath41  which systematically widen the beam spectrum , making the resonance width narrower .",
    "the bpm noise is evaluated from portions of runs with no energy drifts and its standard deviation is 0.02  mm for both stacks . as a result of hardware and software improvements ,",
    "this is much lower than the e760 value , 0.2  mm  @xcite .",
    "the effect on width and area due to bpm noise is larger for small beam widths and for runs with no energy drifts . in the worst case",
    ", it translates into a systematic uncertainty of @xmath71  kev in the width and @xmath72  mev in the area .",
    "we do not correct for this systematic , but uncertainties are assigned to the results of 4  kev and 1  mev , respectively .",
    "the systematic uncertainties in the luminosity ( 2.5% ) and @xmath5efficiency ( 3.6% ) directly affect the area , but not the width .",
    "they are added to obtain an uncertainty of 6.1% or 35  mev .",
    "the absolute energy calibration does not influence the resonance width and area . instead , a systematic error in the  @xmath41  determination has the following effects : it shifts all runs in stack  1 ; it shifts stack  29 with respect to stack  1 .",
    "the systematic uncertainty of 0.05  mm discussed in section  [ sec : beam_energy ] translates into @xmath73 for the width and @xmath74 for the area , and it is therefore neglected .",
    "no systematic uncertainties are therefore introduced by combining the two scans .",
    "the pivot run in the constant - field scan ( section  [ sec : compl_scans ] ) is taken near the central orbit and has a small  @xmath41 , so that its energy relative to the constant - orbit scan can be calculated accurately from eq .",

    "the e835 measurement is the most precise .",
    "our measurement of @xmath76 is also compatible , but much more precise , than that reported by babar , @xmath77  @xcite .",
    "this new method of complementary scans can be applied to future experiments for the direct determination of narrow resonance widths in antiproton - proton annihilations ( such as panda at the future fair facility in darmstadt ) .",
    "if one performs a scan at constant orbit and a scan at constant magnetic field in conditions similar to those in the antiproton accumulator , the uncertainty is mainly statistical .",
    "moreover , by appropriately choosing the relative luminosities and energies of the two scans , one can make the width almost uncorrelated with the phase - slip factor , as in the e835 case discussed in this paper .",
