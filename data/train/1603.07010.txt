    "<S> ldpc lattices were the first family of lattices that equipped with iterative decoding algorithms under which they perform very well in high dimensions . in this paper , we introduce quasi cyclic low density parity check ( qc - ldpc ) lattices as a special case of ldpc lattices with one binary qc - ldpc code as their underlying code . </S>",
    "<S> these lattices are obtained from construction a of lattices providing us to encode them efficiently using shift registers . to benefit from an encoder with linear complexity in dimension of the lattice , we obtain the generator matrix of these lattices in _ quasi cyclic _ form . </S>",

    "<S> qc - ldpc lattices are combined with nested lattice shaping that uses the voronoi region of a sublattice for code shaping . the shaping gain and shaping loss of our lattice codes with dimensions @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 using an optimal quantizer , are presented . </S>",
