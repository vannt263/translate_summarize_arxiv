    "multicomponent systems often exhibit unusual behavior and transport effects @xcite .",
    "many of these effects are caused by the additional correlations which are associated with particle distinguishability .",
    "the short - range `` back correlations '' ( memory effect ) @xcite in the classical two - component lattice gas with excluded volume constraint may serve as an example . at the macroscopic level the particle distinguishability manifests itself as the additional nonlinear flux which is responsible for the mixing of different species of a lattice gas .",
    "this flux leads to the array of anomalous diffusive transport effects , e.g. , the drag effect , formation of the drifting spatial structures @xcite , effects of `` negative '' mass transport @xcite .",
    "when the difference between the values of the component mobility is significant , the nonlinear flux can lead to indirect correlations in the slow subsystem .",
    "these correlations are induced by the light component that plays the role of interaction mediator for the particles of the slow subsystem .",
    "such a phenomenon is similar to the hydrodynamic interactions between colloidal particles @xcite .",
    "one of the intriguing effects observed in these suspensions is the presence of long - time correlations between liquid - embedded particles when the velocity correlation function of a particle pair is characterized by the long - time negative tail @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we are aimed to show the possibility of similar long - time correlations for the slow component of a lattice gas . for this purpose ,",
    "we consider the simplest case of a two - component lattice gas by using the adiabatic and the uniform clusters approximations .",
    "we consider the simplest two - component lattice gas model subject to an excluded volume constraint .",
    "the kinetics is defined by the jumps of particles to the neighboring vacant sites .",
    "the variation of the @xmath0-th site occupancy by the particles of sort @xmath1 during the time interval @xmath2 , @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is the duration of a particle jump to a neighboring site , @xmath5 being the life time of a particle on a site ) , is described by the standard continuity equation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath6 where @xmath7 are the local occupation numbers of particles @xmath1 at the @xmath0-th site , @xmath8 gives the mean number of jumps ( of particles @xmath1 from site @xmath0 to a neighboring site @xmath9 per time @xmath2 ) , @xmath10 is the frequency of these jumps , @xmath11 is the occupation number of the @xmath9th site vacancies .",
    "the term @xmath12 stands for the langevin source of the @xmath0th site occupation number fluctuations .",
    "equations for the average local occupation numbers may be obtained from eqs .",

    "( [ balance+ ] ) , see @xcite , the macroscopic equations take the form @xcite    [ 3 ] @xmath13 @xmath14    where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the average occupation numbers of the two components at the point @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the jump frequencies of particles @xmath15 and @xmath16 , correspondingly .",
    "these equations are obtained in the long - wavelength approximation assuming that the characteristic scale of the gas inhomogeneity is much grater than the lattice constant @xmath20 .",
    "the dimensionless spatial coordinate @xmath21 is introduced .",
    "distinguishability of the particles in the noninteracting lattice gas leads to the additional nonlinear flow @xmath22 in the macroscopic eqs .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) that is absent in the case of a one - component gas .",
    "an important condition for the onset of this additional term is the excluded volume constraint , i.e. , when a site may be occupied by one particle only .",
    "this flow is responsible for the mixing of different particle species and leads to additional correlations in the system .    in the case of considerable difference between the species mobilities , @xmath23",
    ", the indirect correlations can occur in the slow subsystem @xmath16 .",
    "these correlations are induced by the fast component that plays the role of the `` interaction mediator '' .",
    "such correlations are similar to the hydrodynamic correlations between colloidal particles @xcite and may have the long - time character .    in order to show the presence of the long - time correlations in the heavy subsystem of the lattice gas we consider the fluctuations of the heavy particles drift caused by an external field .",
    "they manifest itself as the fluctuations of hydrodynamic velocity field @xmath24 . in what follows , we assume that the characteristic time - scale @xmath25 of the fluctuations @xmath24 satisfies the condition @xmath26 and restrict ourselves to the adiabatic approximation , @xmath27 .",
    "it means that the distribution of the fast component instantly gets into the stationary one with the momentary distribution of the slow component .",
    "then , kinetic equations take form    [ adiabat ] @xmath28    the light component @xmath29 depends on a `` slow '' time @xmath30 as on a parameter .",
    "it should be noted , that the fluctuations of drift are associated with the fluctuations of the particle jump probability @xmath31 between the neighboring lattice sites @xmath0 , @xmath32 and in general case this term may have a more complicated form .",
    "for example , in the case of the asymmetric jumps of the lattice gas particles , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , the drift term reads @xmath35 .",
    "however , here we restrict ourselves to the case given by eqs .",
    "( [ adiabat ] ) and , similarly to @xcite , consider a quasi - one - dimensional situation when interparticle correlations become most significant . in this case",
    ", one can easily eliminate the fast variable @xmath15 from eqs .",

    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ nonlocal ] ) that the correlations in the slow subsystem appear only in the nonequilibrium case with the nonzero flow @xmath39 that is responsible for the nonlinear and nonlocal character of the diffusion process .",
    "next we make use of the uniform density cluster approximation that is often exploited , e.g. , for the description of coulomb explosions of deuterium clusters @xcite . under this approximation ,",
    "the density distribution @xmath45 is considered as a system of uniform one - dimensional clusters .",
    "it is justified when the cluster size is much smaller than that of the system .",
    "each such cluster is characterized by its `` center of mass '' @xmath46 and width @xmath47 , so that the distribution of the slow component can be written as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the number of the particles contained by the @xmath50th cluster .",
