    "the existence of a low - lying state in @xmath0th , with an estimated natural linewidth , @xmath7 , in the range @xmath8  mhz  @xcite , was indirectly established over 3 decades ago  @xcite .",
    "however , direct searches for emission from this m1 transition have so far been unsuccessful  @xcite .",
    "recently , a new indirect measurement has established that the transition energy is 7.8  @xmath9  0.5  ev  @xcite , rather than 3.5  ev as orginally thought .",
    "although well into the vacuum ultraviolet ( vuv ) , this energy is amenable to study by laser spectroscopy , opening the door for use of this transition as a highly stable oscillator in next generation optical clocks . the transition is also predicted to show a 10@xmath10-fold enhancement in sensitivity to the time variation of several fundamental constants@xcite , _",
    "e.g. _ the fine structure constant . while the current measurement uncertainty of the nuclear transition energy is very good by nuclear physics standards ,",
    "it must be drastically improved in order to realize the exciting applications of this transition .",
    "we have recently proposed a novel approach to _ directly _ measure the transition energy to a much higher precision by interrogating @xmath0th that has been doped into a vuv transparent crystal  @xcite . using this approach more than 10@xmath11",
    "th nuclei can be interrogated , which allows for fluorescence rates sufficient to directly measure the transition energy using a broadband synchrotron light source .    in this article , we present measurements of inherent vuv - induced background signals which could mask fluorescence from the isomer state in @xmath0th for several candidate host crystals . while the data shows that many of the crystals display some spurious fluorescence , the fluorescence is in general of a low level and short - lived compared to that expected from the isomeric transition .",
    "of all the crystals measured , we have determined licaf ( licaalf@xmath5 ) to be the most suitable as it yields very little background fluorescence when it is directly illuminated with vuv light .",
    "additonally , it shows resilience to vuv - induced radiation damage and has been grown with @xmath6th as a dopant at the 0.05% level .",
    "it also has several key structural properties that mitigate broadenings of the isomeric transition energy in a crystal environment .",
    "the first steps towards realizing the exciting applications of this transition are identifying suitable host crystals and determining the transition frequency to a greater precision .",
    "the key requirements for the host crystal are that it be reasonably transparent in the vuv , have a pure crystalline structure , and chemically accept th@xmath12 ions .",
    "numerous candidate hosts can be identified in the extensive family of fluoride crystals .",
    "potential crystals include na@xmath4thf@xmath5 , licaf ( licaalf@xmath5 ) , lisaf ( lisralf@xmath5 ) , ylf ( ylif@xmath13 ) , and caf@xmath4 , which can be grown by various techniques , _",
    "e.g. _ czochralski , bridgman , etc .",
    "while these crystals have band - gaps of @xmath1410ev , impurities and color centers can cause residual absorption and may interfere with the @xmath0th optical spectroscopy .",
    "various metal ions as well as oxygen - based impurities at the part - per - million level can lead to absorption coefficients of up to 0.1@xmath15  @xcite . to ensure crystal transparency , purification methods",
    "must be employed to reduce these impurities to part - per - billion levels  @xcite .",
    "we have applied these methods to the preparation of high purity metal fluoride precursors for crystal growth .",
    "so far , we have studied crystals that were obtained commercially from ac materials . these include na@xmath4thf@xmath5 ,",
    "th : licaf , th : ylf , and th : nayf which were grown using the less expensive , but chemically identical , @xmath6th isotope .",
    "the th : nayf and th : ylf were grown with a target doping of 0.1% molar while the th : licaf was grown with a target doping of 1% molar .",
    "these crystals are good control crystals as the isomeric transition is not present in @xmath6th , but are chemically identical and thus the doping process as well as all vuv induced backgrounds are the same .",
    "they therefore allow us to study which crystals are most suitable for higher precision measurements of the isomeric transition energy .",
    "as previously mentioned , a major advantage to our approach for measuring the isomer energy is the large number of @xmath0th nuclei that can be addressed .",
    "this allows for fluorescence rates sufficient for the use of standard spectroscopic techniques to determine the transition energy to a higher precision .",
    "we plan to use a multi - phase experimental approach  @xcite to investigate the ulimate precision to which this transition energy can be measured .    the first phase will be a low resolution study using the 9.0.2.1 beam line at the advanced light source ( als ) at lawrence berkeley labs .",
    "the als provides a tunable vuv light source ( 5  ev-30  ev ) with a linewidth ( @xmath16 ) of 0.175  ev , a photon flux ( @xmath17 ) of @xmath1810@xmath19 photons/@xmath20s , and a 170  @xmath21 m  @xmath22  50  @xmath21 m spot size . assuming both the light ( @xmath16 ) and broadened transition ( @xmath23 ) linewidths to be lorentzian , then far from saturation , the excitation rate , @xmath24 , is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) is the transition frequency ( wavelength ) , @xmath28 is the center frequency of the als beam , and @xmath29 is the total number of ground state @xmath0th nuclei addressed by the als beam . to locate the transition the als center frequency",
    "will be scanned across the interesting range of ( 7.8  @xmath9  0.5  ev ) in steps of 0.05  ev with 200  s of illumination followed by 100  s of light collection at each point . even in the lowest fluorescence case ( @xmath30  @xmath21hz )",
    ", we expect a minimum total fluorescence rate of @xmath1815  khz when the als is on resonance .",
    "once the resonance is found , longer illumination will lead to sufficient fluorescence rates for a vuv spectrometer measurement .",
    "we expect that the transition frequency can be determined to @xmath1850  @xmath15 ( 0.1  nm ) in these experiments , but this of course relies on sufficiently low background fluorescence rates . as a result",
    ", we have performed test runs on our control crystals using the vuv light beam at the als .",
    "the setup used is shown in fig .",
    "[ als_setup ] .",
    "each control crystal ( 3  mm @xmath22 3  mm @xmath22 10  mm ) was illuminated along its long axis with the als beam and any resultant fluorescence from the crystal was collected in a direction orthogonal to the beam via a 2-lens system .",
    "both lenses were fabricated from lif and held in vacuum .",
    "the fluorescence was imaged onto the photocathode of a photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) ( hamamatsu r7639 ) .",
    "the pmt was either under a constant argon purge or held in vacuum to mitigate vuv absorption by air .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ als_setup ] , two pneumatic shutters were mounted inside the vacuum chamber .",
    "one shutter was used to prevent vuv scattered light from hitting the pmt during crystal illumination , and the second shutter was used to block the als beam before photon collection with the pmt began .",
    "this introduced a small delay between the point when illumination ended and photon collection began , but in all cases the delay was less than 28  ms .",
    "as the shortest prediction for the @xmath0th isomer lifetime is @xmath18100  s this is sufficiently fast to investigate any spurious long - lived background fluorescence signals in the host crystal that might interfere with measuring fluorescence from the isomeric transition . in what follows ,",
    "we present the data for all crystals that we have measured to date .         the data for th : nayf is shown in fig .",
    "[ thnayf_excitation_spectrum ] .",
    "the excitation spectrum was obtained by illuminating the crystal for 5  s with the als beam at a fixed energy and then collecting photons from the crystal over the next 10.7  s using the full bandwidth of the pmt ( 120  nm  -  220  nm ) . due to limitations in the operation of the beam and pmt shutters , there was a delay of 28  ms between the end of the illumination period and photon collection period . at each excitation energy , the process was repeated 5 times .",
    "the data points and their error bars in the figure are the average and standard deviation of the results .",
    "the data shown takes into account the photon detection efficiency and the y - axis is therefore the total average fluorescence rate from the crystal over the 10.7  s of photon collection .",
    "the background fluorescence rate , measured by leaving the vuv light beam blocked blocked during the illumination stage , was consistent with pmt dark counts ( @xmath181  hz ) and has been subtracted in the plot .",
    "there is clearly a very large fluorescence peak at a beam energy @xmath317.4  ev , however , because the als was in high energy mode ( electron storage ring at 1.9  gev instead of 1.5  gev ) for this run , we were unable to tune below 7.4  ev .",
    "nonetheless , we measured the lifetime of fluorescence arising from the 7.4  ev excitation light to be @xmath18320  ms .",
    "we also measured the saturation of this fluorescence signal as a function of illumination time . due to the finite closing speed of the pneumatic shutter used to block the als beam , the data of fig .",
    "[ thnayf_signal_vs_illumination ] can only be used to place an upper limit of @xmath18250  ms on the saturation rate of the fluorescence .",

    "finally , we note that upon inspection of the crystal after illumination , the crystal showed some radiation damage due to the vuv exciation beam .",

[ licafexcitationspectrum ] and was obtained in a similar way to the above crystals though the experimental details are slightly different . here",
    "the crystal was illuminated for 5  s , but photons were only collected for 5.4  s. due to improved timing controls , the delay time between illumination and photon collection was also reduced to 5  ms .",
    "each data point is the average of 3 repetitions for each beam energy , and its error bar is the standard deviation of the 3 points from the average .",
    "again , the als was in high energy mode for this data run , which prevented us from obtaining data below 7.4  ev . nevertheless , we measured the fluorescence lifetime at 7.4  ev and that data is shown in fig .",
