    "a quantitative understanding of radiation transport in the cool molecule - dominated regions in planetary and ultracool dwarf atmospheres is essential to many aspects of understanding the temperature structure , thermal evolution , and formation of these objects .    in freedman08",
    "( hereafter , f08 ) we presented a detailed discussion of atomic and molecular line opacities used by our group in modeling the atmospheres of brown dwarfs and giant planets [ e.g.][]marley02,fortney05,saumon08,fortney08a , marley10 . since mean opacities can also be widely used in many contexts , in f08 we also computed rosseland and planck mean opacities from 75 to 4000 k , 0.3 mbar to 300 bar , at metallicities of [ m / h ] = -0.3 , 0.0 , and + 0.3 .",
    "these tabulations have since found wide use in the communities working to understand giant planet formation [ e.g.,][]mordasini12a , bodenheimer13 , the temperature structure of giant planet atmospheres [ e.g.][]paxton13 , and planetary and ultracool dwarf thermal evolution [ e.g.,][]batygin11,valencia13,paxton13 .    here",
    "we extend our previous work in a number of important aspects .",
    "in addition to updates in opacities of particular molecules ( described below ) , these new calculations are performed over a much larger phase space .",
    "mean opacity calculations at pressures from 1 @xmath0bar to 300 bars and 75 to 4000 k are presented , which is a much larger range in pressure , in particular at higher temperatures and lower pressures , compared to f08 .",
    "the overall temperature resolution of this compilation is also much finer .",
    "furthermore , we present calculations over a wide range of metallicities , from solar up to [ m / h]=+1.7 ( @xmath150@xmath2 solar ) , in several increments .",
    "these high metallicities may well - approximate the metal - rich atmospheres of giant planets , up to levels of the solar system s ice giant planets , uranus and neptune guillot07 .",
    "finally , for use in models of irradiated planetary atmospheres , we calculate mean opacities where the temperature in the weighting function is not the local temperature , but rather stellar blackbody temperatures from 3000 - 7000 k , to simulate mean `` incident flux '' or `` visible '' opacities to understand the absorption of incident stellar flux in planetary atmospheres .",
    "modern calculations of warm planetary atmospheres must draw from a variety of databases , including hitran rothman:2009 , hitemp rothman:2010 , exomol tennyson12 , and other sources . sharp07 and",
    "f08 provided excellent overviews of available opacities for giant planet and brown dwarf atmosphere modeling .",
    "much of this information remains current .",
    "our major changes since f08 are in ammonia , molecular hydrogen collision - induced absorption ( cia ) , methane , and carbon dioxide .",
    "for nh@xmath3 the updated reference is yurchenko:2011 , which is a first - principles calculation for temperatures up to 1500 k , which replaces our use of hitran . for h@xmath4 cia",
    "we use richard:2012 in place of previous work by borysow02 . in our recent work on brown dwarf model atmospheres",
    ", we have found these new opacity databases provide better fits to observed brown dwarf spectra saumon12,morley12 .",
    "two very recent opacity calculations for methane and carbon dioxide are now included . for methane",
    "we make use of the new first - principles line lists of yurchenko13 and yurchenko14 , which replaces our previous use of older sources brown:2005,strong:1993,wenger:1998 .",
    "we also now include the opacity contributions of co@xmath4 @xcite , which is a very minor player at solar metallicity , but rises in importance in metal - rich atmospheres as its abundance grows quadratically in metallicity lodders02 .",
    "all of our relevant molecular opacities , as well as the references , are collected in table 1 .    as in our previous tabulations",
    ", here we do not account for the opacity of liquids or solids , which in the relatively high gravity atmospheres of planets and brown dwarfs may be confined to cloud decks .",
    "the opacity of these clouds decks is likely to be a strong function of poorly known parameters ( vigor of vertical mixing , particle size , particle size distribution ) and also other parameters that can not be readily incorporated into tables for general application over a range of object surface gravities and temperature structures .",
    "therefore , to maximize the utility of these calculations in the wide variety of potential applications , we continue to exclude the opacity of condensates .",
    "the condensation of cloud species , and their removal from the gas phase , is described below .",
    "the abundances of relevant atoms and molecules must be known at a given pressure and temperature in order to assess the wavelength dependent opacity . as in f08 we make use of the chemistry calculations of k. lodders and collaborators , using the base solar abundances of lodders03 .",
    "the chemistry calculations are described in a series of papers [ e.g.,][]fegley94,lodders99,lodders02,lodders02b , lodders06,lodders09 , which use the condor code .",
    "chemistry is calculated assuming that thermodynamic equilibrium is reached .",
    "this approximation is generally realized at high temperatures , where chemical reactions speed up dramatically .",
    "however , it becomes less correct at lower temperatures , where the timescale for vertical mixing in an atmosphere can be faster than relevant chemical conversion timescales .",
    "these effects have been explored in solar system giant planets , exoplanets , and brown dwarfs in many papers [ e.g.,][]prinn77,fegley96,saumon03,saumon06,hubeny07,visscher11 .",
    "this can generally lead to an incorrect estimation of the mixing ratios of carbon - bearing and nitrogen - bearing molecules , as the molecules co and n@xmath4 often have very long timescales for conversion to other molecules at low temperature . however , these effects depend strongly on the exact temperature structure of an atmosphere , as well the vertical mixing time . these two effects can not be generalized and incorporated with these tables , which are meant to be used over a wide phase space .",
    "perhaps most importantly , these mixing ratio differences are not a first - order effect .",
    "as described in f08 , the chemistry calculations are applicable to giant planets and ultracool dwarfs , which have significant self - gravity , unlike in protostellar disks . in disks ,",
    "condensates remain well - mixed and in contact with the surrounding gas , which allows for further chemical reactions between condensates and gases .",
    "however , within planets and brown dwarfs , condensates form clouds that are typically vertically confined to a narrow region , often less than a gas scale height . above a given refractory cloud , at lower pressures ,",
    "the atmosphere is then gradually depleted in the compounds ( atoms or molecules ) that have gone into forming the condensate . simply , the availability of these refractory compounds in the gas becomes greatly diminished . whether or not the gas phase remains in contact with condensates can have dramatic effects on chemical equilibrium calculations burrows99,lodders99,allard01,lodders02 with decreasing temperature . as discussed in f08 ,",
    "all available evidence from brown dwarfs and the solar system s giant planets points towards this method of  condensation , then depletion \" of chemistry calculation as being most correct for these objects .",
    "our wavelength - dependent opacities are calculated in wavenumber space over a grid corresponding to wavelengths from 0.268 to 227 @xmath0 m . in figure",
    "[ example ] we show the wavelength dependent opacity at 400 k , 1400 k , and 2600 k , all at 1 bar .",

    ", there is relatively less opacity , but at warmer temperatures neutral atomic alkalis are present , which provide important opacities at 1400 k. at 2600 k , tio and vo gases are also important and generally overwhelm the alkali opacity .",

    "the contributions of electrons ( thomson scattering , in green ) and negative hydrogen ions ( yellow ) are negligible at low temperatures but rise in importance at the highest temperatures as more free electrons are available .",

    "the high pressure and low temperature corner of phase space is not included ( @xmath1 100 k and 100 bar ) , as these conditions do not occur in atmospheres . for reference ,",
    "the f08 calculations were at 324 points , and did not go to pressures below 0.3 mbar .",
    "in addition , high temperatures were only included at high pressures , while our revised grid is nearly square .",
    "the grid is sampled in temperatures from 754000 k and finely sampled from 100 - 350 k ( 10 k between points ) where water and ammonia condensation change the mixing ratio of these opacity sources quite dramatically .",
    "we compute the rosseland mean ( rm ) opacity , defined as : @xmath6 and the planck mean ( pm ) opacity , defined as : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the wavelength - dependent opacity and @xmath9 is the planck function , at all of these 1060 _ p  t _ points .    as an illustration , in figure [ rmpm ] at 1 bar and 1000 k , we show in black the total wavelength - dependent opacity , with the weighting function for rm opacity ( top ) and pm opacity ( bottom ) .",
    "the peak of both weighting functions is at the same wavelength , but they have a different functional form and shape . in blue",
    "are the calculated rm and pm values . for reference",
    "the running integral of the mean opacities are shown in dotted red on an arbitrary linear axis , starting from long wavelengths . as expected , the dominant contributions to the rm opacities are in opacity minima , while for the pm opacities , these occur at opacity maxima .",
    "it is interesting to note that , as has been pointed out as least as far back as king56 [ see also][for a modern update]parmentier14a , that the ratio of the rm to the pm in an atmosphere is a measure of how important wavelength - dependnent ( non - gray ) effects are in determining the atmospheric temperature structure .",
    "figure [ rm ] shows the rm opacity calculation on the entire grid , presented as a colored contour plot .",

    "this is shown for the rm opacities in figure [ f08compare1 ] , where pressure is color - coded .",
    "in general , the agreement is at the level of 10% or better .",
    "cia is important over the entire temperature range , and we find that @xmath180% of the generally small differences between the two calculations are due to this upgrade to the opacities from richard:2012 .",
    "larger differences ( though never more than a factor of 2 ) are seen below @xmath1 1000 k , where warm ammonia is the main nitrogen carrier .",
    "the first - princples yurchenko:2011 line list is a significant improvement over our previously - used hitran database , which lacked proper temperature dependence and was quite incomplete in the near infrared . as ammonia is lost into a cloud below @xmath1200 k , these differences between the f08 and new calculations are minimized .",
    "we can also compare our calculations to those of another group . in figure [ wich ]",
    "we compare our rm results at 1000 , 2000 , and 3000 k to those of ferguson05 .",

    "while the original f08 opacity calculations spanned a fairly narrow range of metallicities , from [ m / h]=-0.5 to + 0.5 , here we expand these calculations to include [ m / h ] = 0 , + 0.5 , + 0.7 , + 1.0 , + 1.5 , and + 1.7 , roughly corresponding to 1@xmath2 , 3@xmath2 , 5@xmath2 , 10@xmath2 , 30@xmath2 , and 50@xmath2 solar abundances .",

    "over the past several years a variety of analytic work on the temperature structure of strongly irradiated planetary atmospheres has been published [ e.g.,][]hansen08,guillot10,heng12,robinson12,parmentier14a , parmentier14b .",
    "these works generally aim to understand the atmospheric temperature structure , and presence or absence of temperature inversions , with as few free parameters as possible . generally at a minimum",
    "one needs to know the thermal infrared opacity , and the relevant `` visible '' opacity for incoming stellar intensity .",
    "the nature of the visible opacity is in principle straightforward to physically understand .",
    "what one is interested in is how the stellar radiation field is attenuated by the wavelength - dependent opacity of the planetary atmosphere , as a function for depth",
    ". often this is prescribed as a gray atmospheric constant , meaning the visible opacity is chosen as a wavelength - independent constant [ e.g.][]heng12 or that the ratio of the visible to thermal opacity is a constant [ e.g.][]guillot10 . in principle",
    ", one could be interested in an opacity based either on the rm or pm , but we caution that either is an approximation to the real atmospheric bevahior , as the wavelength - dependent downwelling ( and upwelling ) stellar intensity can in general change strongly with depth .    within the framework of an opacity table theses rm or pm visible opacities can be readily calculated across our _ p - t _ space by modifying the rm and pm formulas to use the temperature of a _ stellar _",
    "@xmath27 , rather than the _ local _ gas temperature .",
    "hence the weighting function is no longer the intensity characteristic of the local temperature but that of the incoming stellar intensity . in practice here",
    "we use stellar blackbody intensities from 3000 to 7000 k , and the same tabulated wavelength - dependent opacities , including scattering .",
    "these visible opacities should be used with some caution .",
    "guillot10 ( his equation 9 ) postulate a use for the pm for the incident stellar intensity at the top of the atmosphere , however , the stellar intensity begins to dramatically deviate from a blackbody as the wavelength dependent flux is carved by absorption , with increasing depth .",
    "however , in a revision of the guillot10 work , parmentier14b ( see their ",
    "5.1.1 ) suggest that instead the stellar-@xmath27  weighted rm is much more useful to understand the depth to which incident stellar flux penentrates , since the rm most heavily weights at wavelengths where opacity is low .",
    "they base their suggestion of the utility of the weighted rm by comparing derived model temperature structures that utilize gray opacities , to those that use full frequency - dependent opacity calculations . for our purposes , we choose to calculate both the stellar - weighted rm and pm tables over our large _",
    "p - t _ space , such that they can be of some use to the community , for current and future investigations .",
    "this change in the temperature of the weighting function can lead to dramatically different results for the rm and pm for a given composition .",
    "an example at 1 bar and 1000 k is shown in figure [ weight ] . in the top panel ,",
    "as the weighting function moves from the near infrared ( 1000 k ) towards the optical ( 3000 k and higher ) the rm falls dramatically due to opacity minima between the pressure - broadened alkali lines , which dominates the rm calculation . in the bottom panel , for the pm ,",
    "somewhat opposite behavior is found . as the weighting function overlaps with these same alkali lines they again dominate , leading to a dramatic increase in the pm opacity .",
    "some general behavior is shown in figure [ weight2 ] .",
    "this is a plot of the ratio of rm calculated at the stellar temperature , divided by the rm calculated at the local temperature , at 1 bar .",
    "a change in behavior is found around 1000 k. at higher temperatures , there is a much weaker dependence on the weighting function temperature , since the local temperature weighting function moves toward having a greater overlap with the stellar @xmath27s .",
    "the ratio approaches 1 and is exactly 1.0 for 3000 k , with a 3000 k @xmath27 , and at 4000 k , for a 4000 k @xmath27 , as expected . below 1000 k , even when the gas becomes cool enough that na and k condense and are lost from the gas phase , the optical opacity windows do not change dramatically , and water vapor dominates in the mid ir for the thermal opacity , such that the behavior does not have a strong dependence on the local gas temperature .",
    "we present our calculated opacities in tables 3 - 8 , which run from solar metallicity ( [ m / h]=0.0 ) to @xmath150@xmath2 solar ( [ m / h]=+1.7 ) , including intermediate increments of + 0.5 , + 0.7 , + 1.0 , and + 1.5 .",

    "we use state - of - the art calculations for all molecules and atoms .",
    "the generally good agreement between models of brown dwarf atmospheres and observations stephens09,saumon12,morley12 suggests that we are on the right track in understanding the chemical abundances and opacity of cool atmospheres .",
    "the general very close agreement at solar metallicity between our calculations here and f08 , suggests that future tabulations of purely gaseous opacities over this range of pressure , temperature , and metallicity , probably will not change dramatically in the future .",
    "future directions could include the use of a variety of c / o ratios , which change the mixing ratios of water vapor , carbon monoxide , and methane .",
    "with regard to the inclusion of cloud opacity in atmospheres , we note that cuzzi14 recently published a method to calculate the mean opacities of porous aggregates for use in dusty disks and cloudy atmospheres .    with regard to main absorbers that could have an identifiable impact on the mean opacities , and where there is still likely considerable room for improvement",
    ", we suggest the alkali metals . our treatment of alkali metal opacity , following the work of bms , is still approximate .",
    "detailed calculations of alkali line shapes , perturbed by collisions with h@xmath4 and he are still in progress allard03,allard05 , but they do not yet reach to high enough pressures to be used over all of our phase space .",
    "also , for methane , detailed comparisons should be made between the databases of yurchenko14 , used here , and the recent calculations of rey14 .",
    "we hope that these calculations will find broad use in the community .",

    "<S> in addition to computing mean opacities at these local temperatures , we also calculate them with weighting functions up to 7000 k , to simulate the mean opacities for incident stellar intensities , rather than locally thermally emitted intensities . </S>",
    "<S> the chemical equilibrium calculations account for the settling of condensates in a gravitational field and are applicable to cloud - free giant planet and ultracool dwarf atmospheres , but not circumstellar disks . </S>",
