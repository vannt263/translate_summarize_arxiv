    "the interplay of the strong electron correlation and the band topology attracts much attention in recent years after the discovery of the two dimensional quantum spin hall insulator ( qsh ) and three - dimensional topological band insulator.@xcite both of these two novel insulators are the bulk band insulator but have nontrivial gapless edge or surface states protected by the time - reversal symmetry.@xcite when strongly electron correlated effect is considered , understanding the fate of the bulk topology and the corresponding boundary states is still a challenge in the condensed matter community.@xcite despite of the hardness of this issue , many new and exotic states of matter have been uncovered , e.g. , the topological mott insulator,@xcite fractional chern / topological insulator,@xcite z@xmath1-fractionalized chern / topological insulator,@xcite topological kondo insulator@xcite and topological antiferromagnetic spin - density - wave phase.@xcite    among them , the concept of topological kondo insulator ( tki ) has been proposed as an extension of the original topological ( band ) insulators into the heavy fermion systems.@xcite in usual topological insulators the spin - orbit coupling is encoded in a spin - dependent hopping amplitudes between different unit cells .",
    "the tki is produced by the spin - orbit coupling associated with the hybridization between conduction and local electrons and its resulting energy band is also heavily renormalized by the local strong correlation of local electrons.@xcite in comparison to the conventional kondo insulator ( ki),@xcite the tki remains a renormalized band insulator but it possesses certain conducting surface - states , which could be identified experimentally from the usual ki compounds . theoretically , the three - dimensional tki may be relevant to certain heavy fermion compounds with strong spin - orbit coupling .",
    "very recent experimental studies on the classic kondo insulator smb@xmath2 seem to support that smb@xmath2 is a putative three - dimensional topological kondo insulator.@xcite this motivates us further study of the tki in these strongly correlated systems .",
    "very recently , a microscopic kondo lattice model on the two - dimensional honeycomb lattice with spin - orbit coupling between conduction electrons has been proposed to understand the interplay between spin - orbit coupling ( bulk topology ) and kondo screening effect in two - dimensional system .",
    "@xcite in that paper the authors found the ki and the qsh insulators paramagnetic phases , and identified continuous second - order quantum phase transition between these two phases .",
    "however , it should be noted that the magnetic long - range ordered states , which commonly appear and rather relevant for both the theoretical kondo lattice - like models and realistic heavy fermion compounds , have not been clearly explored in the previous work of feng @xcite . as a matter fact , in some heavy fermion materials ,",
    "the antiferromagnetism is even near by or coexistent with unconventional superconductivity . in this case",
    "the magnetic fluctuation is believed to be driving force of such superconducting instability.@xcite furthermore , many experimentally observed exotic non - fermi liquid behaviors are also close to the magnetic instability and its related quantum critical points.@xcite on the other hand , intuitively , based on our previous studies on the kondo lattice models on the honeycomb lattice,@xcite we suspect that the paramagnetic states are not stable to magnetic phases , particularly , the qsh insulator found by feng is always unstable to the antiferromagnetic spin - wave - density ( sdw ) states if the kondo coupling between local spins and conduction electrons is not vanishing small .",
    "another interesting feature of including the magnetic order is that it could give rise to an example of the mentioned topological antiferromagnetic sdw ( t - sdw ) phase.@xcite the t - sdw phase is identified as an antiferromagnetic sdw state with some nontrivial bulk topological quantum numbers or bulk charge / spin response .",
    "this state is indeed beyond the classic landau s symmetry - breaking classification of matter since the t - sdw and the normal sdw ( n - sdw ) states have identical bulk symmetry ( breaking the spin - rotation invariance due to the antiferromagnetic order).@xcite in some sense , the t - sdw states can be considered as an interesting extension of the usual topological insulator with the broken time - reversal symmetry by the magnetic long - range order .    in the present work",
    ", we discuss these interesting issues in the kane - mele - kondo lattice model proposed in ref . at half - filling .",
    "to be specific , we will use the mean - field decoupling to obtain magnetic t and n - sdw phases as well as the paramagnetic ki and qsh insulator phases .",
    "importantly , the magnetic ordered t and n - sdw states are novel features of the current work beyond that in the previous paper of feng @xcite .",
    "we compare ground - state energies of those phases to establish the global phase diagram for the kane - mele - kondo lattice model . after identifying those phases ,",
    "the corresponding topological chern number is explicitly calculated and the chern - simons and quantum electrodynamics - like effective field theories are utilized to capture the possible topological properties by taking important quantum fluctuations around the mean - field solutions into account .    it is found that the low energy effective theory of the @xmath0 topological ordered t - sdw phase can be constructed by the hydrodynamics approach , which is successfully applied to the well - known integer and fractional quantum hall effect.@xcite the hydrodynamics approach gives rise to a mutual u(1)@xmath3 u(1 ) chern - simons action coupled to the external electromagnetic and spin gauge - field . furthermore , the bulk - boundary correspondence of the chern - simons theory provides a candidate of the helical edge - state for the t - sdw phase .",
    "more interestingly , the topological quantum phase transition between the t and n - sdw phases is described by the unexpected three - dimensional quantum electrodynamics , which appears in many important condensed theory issues , e.g. the gauge theory description of high - temperature supconductivity,@xcite the quantum spin liquids in quantum magnets@xcite and the deconfined quantum criticality@xcite .",
    "such emergent quantum electrodynamics is a novel feature of the present work and is also not covered in ref .. in the present case , we find that conduction electrons contribute to the low - energy dirac fermions while the spin - wave fluctuation gives rise to an effective dynamic u(1 ) gauge - field .",
    "critical quasiparticle , thermodynamic and transport behaviors of the emergent quantum electrodynamics are analyzed at the lowest - order and the one - loop levels .",
    "furthermore , we find that if the kondo coupling is turned on , the qsh insulator becomes unstable in comparison to the antiferromagnetic sdw states , thus at least within framework of our mean - field theory , the ground - state phase diagram will not cover the qsh state found in ref . and only t / n - sdw and ki phases remain .",
    "the transition of these two magnetic states to the ki phase is first - order .",
    "additionally , we have also discussed the doped kane - mele - kondo lattice model and ferromagnetism may be relevant when the system is deviated from the half - filling case .",
    "the relation to the tki and many implications from both numerical and experimental studies are also argued with an aim toward the realization of the kane - mele - kondo model and confirmation of the various phases of the ground - state phase diagram .    to briefly summarize , we focus on the magnetic properties of the kane - mele - kondo lattice model , and find two kinds of novel ordered phases , namely , the n- and t - sdw phases .",
    "furthermore , the topological quantum phase transition between two magnetic phases found is a novel featu____re for this model , and its effective field theory is the celebrated 2 + 1d qed , which appears in many important and interesting issues , for example , deconfined quantum criticality , gauge - theory description of the high temperature superconductivity and quantum spin liquids in quantum magnets .",
    "finally , we also systematically discussed the topological properties of the model including topological chern number , effective chern - simons field - theory for the z@xmath4 topological ordered phase , the edge - state hamiltonian , and so on .",
    "these results have not clearly identified in the previous work published by feng _",

    "the following model we considered is the anisotropic kondo lattice model on the honeycomb lattice at half - filling , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the well - known kane - mele hamiltonian,@xcite which supports the quantum spin hall ( qsh ) effect with helical edge states ( right and left movers are locked with the up and down spin , respectively ) , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the nearest - neighbor and the next - nearest - neighbor hopping , respectively.@xcite the phase @xmath9 is introduced to give rise to a quantum spin hall effect without external magnetic fields ( the so - called qsh ) and the positive phase is gained with anticlockwise hopping . besides , the pseudofermion representation for local spins has been utilized as @xmath10 with @xmath11 being usual pauli matrix and a local constraint @xmath12 enforced in each site .",
    "@xmath13 denotes the magnetic instability due to the polarization of conduction electrons by local spins while @xmath14 describes the local kondo screening effect resulting from spin - flip scattering process of conduction electrons by local moments .",
    "the interplay between the kondo screening effect and the magnetic instability on the honeycomb lattice without the nontrivial next - nearest - neighbor hopping term ( @xmath8 ) has been studied by some of the present authors in the previous work .",
    "@xcite in that work , we find either a direct first - order transition or a possible coexistence of the kondo insulator and the n - sdw state by using the extended mean - field decoupling .",
    "furthermore , we have also discussed the haldane - kondo lattice model where the conduction electrons are described by the spinful haldane model.@xcite we found an extra antiferromagnetic phase , namely the t - sdw state , which has a quantized charge hall conductance coexistent the magnetic order .",
    "the transition of t - sdw state into the conventional n - sdw state is found to fall into a xy - like topological quantum phase transition .",
    "the model we study here is different to the haldane - kondo lattice model and more richer physics has been found in comparison to the previous one .",
    "in particular , the t - sdw in the present paper is different to the one in ref .",
    "since the current t - sdw phase has a quantized spin hall conductance and the edge - state is the helical edge - state .",
    "we now use the hydrodynamics approach to establish an effective theory for t - sdw phase by extracting the bulk topological properties and to identify existence of the non - chiral edge - state .",
    "more interestingly , the phase transition between t and n - sdw is now described by the three - dimensional quantum electrodynamics ( qed-3 ) in contrast to the xy transition in the previous work .",
    "the qed-3 theory may give rise to a nontrivial universal conductance , which is also different to the previous work .",
    "in addition , we also provide many discussion on the doped system , which is important but not considered before .",
    "recently , feng _ et al .",
    "_ have studied the above model eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] by using the slave boson mean - field theory .",
    "they mainly focus on the possible paramagnetic states , i.e. , the kondo insulator and the quantum spin hall insulator ( two dimensional topological insulator ) .",
    "they found a second - order transition between those two paramagnetic states .",
    "however , the magnetic ordered states , which commonly appear in the kondo lattice - like models and realistic heavy fermion compounds , are not studied .",
    "intuitively , based on our previous studies on the kondo lattice models on the honeycomb lattice , we suspect that the paramagnetic states are not stable to magnetic phases , particularly , the quantum spin hall insulator is always unstable to the antiferromagnetic sdw states if the kondo coupling is not vanishing small . in the present paper",
    "we will discuss this issue in the following sections and we will explore the various transitions among those magnetic and paramagnetic phases and establish the global phase diagram for the ground - state of the kane - mele - kondo lattice model .      in the present paper ,",
    "the t - sdw state is an antiferromagnetic long - range ordered state with the quantized spin hall effect and a helical edge - state .",
    "similar t - sdw phase seems to be found in a numerical way and the time - reversal symmetry may be recovered in the edge , thus the helical edge - state is protected by the recovered symmetry.@xcite in contrast , in ref .",
    ", the t - sdw phase represents a time - reversal symmetry - breaking antiferromagnetic state with the quantized charge hall effect .",
    "the broken time - reversal symmetry leads to two chiral edge - states in the latter t - sdw phase , which is similar to the case of usual electric or bosonic integer quantum hall effect where the external / effecitve large magnetic field explicitly breaks the time - reversal invariance and leads to energy bands with nontrivial chern number.@xcite      in this subsection , we present the mean - field decoupling and the consultant mean - field hamiltonian , which is our starting point to study the ground - state phase diagram of the kane - mele - kondo lattice model [ eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) ] .",
    "although the mean - field treatment of generic two - dimensional lattice models needs caution in strong correlation scenario , it may provide qualitatively correct physics if quantum fluctuations are weak . in the following discussion ,",
    "we assume that the mean - field treatment is able to capture the basic features of the kane - mele - kondo lattice model . further study on this model in terms of advanced numerical techniques is desirable .    by using the mean - field decoupling as presented in refs . and",

    "the mean - field parameters @xmath22 correspond to magnetization of local spins and conduction electrons , respectively , and serve as usual magnetic order parameters .",
    "the non - vanishing kondo hybridizing parameter @xmath23 denotes the onset of kondo screening effect and it can also be considered as an order parameter although the formation of kondo screening does not imply any global symmetry - breaking .",
    "besides , since we are considering a half - filled lattice , the local constraint of the pseudofermion has been safely neglected at the present mean - field level with chemical potential set to zero.@xcite    with the mean - field hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) in hand , we can extract some but not all possible physical phases .",
    "firstly , when all mean - field parameters are zero , the hamiltonian will only have the conduction electron part and this just corresponds to the quantum spin hall state.@xcite secondly , when kondo hybridizing parameter @xmath23 is non - vanishing but @xmath24 , this is the kondo state . since the system is half - filling",
    ", one may expect that it is the kondo insulating state.@xcite thirdly ,",
    "if we have @xmath25 with @xmath26 , the corresponding state is the antiferromagnetic ordered state . finally ,",
    "if all of the mean - field parameters are nonzero , one may find a state where the antiferromagnetic long - range order coexists with the kondo screening.@xcite interestingly , we will find an antiferromagnetic ordered state with a quantized spin hall conductance , which is beyond our naive inspect due to blindness for the subtle topological properties .",
    "detailed study on these possible states is the purpose of the present paper but the coexistent state will be left for future study due to its complexity and subtlety .    before moving to the discussion on the possible states of kane - mele - kondo lattice model in the next section , it is helpful to give a brief argument on the basic properties of kane - mele model and its corresponding chern - simons treatment",
    "since these issues may not appear in the literature of heavy fermions and the same technique will be used in the next section . another motivation to do this is that when the mean - field order parameters are all zero , the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) is reduced to the pure kane - mele model , which is just the quantum spin hall insulator found in ref . .",
    "in this subsection , we give a brief discussion about the basic property of the kane - mele model @xcite @xmath27 it is useful to rewrite this single - particle hamiltonian in the momentum space as @xmath28 \\nonumber\\\\ & & + 2t'\\sigma\\gamma(k)[c_{ka\\sigma}^{\\dag}c_{ka\\sigma}-c_{kb\\sigma}^{\\dag}c_{kb\\sigma } ] , \\label{eq4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have defined @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , @xmath32 representing two nonequivalent sublattices of the honeycomb lattice , respectively .",
    "then , by diagonalizing the above hamiltonian , one obtains the quasiparticle energy band as @xmath33 which preserves the particle - hole symmetry and also the spin degeneracy .",
    "it is well - known that for @xmath34 , the excitation gap mainly opens near six dirac points ( only two of them are nonequivalent in fact).@xcite then , expanding both @xmath35 and @xmath36 near two nonequivalent dirac points @xmath37 , respectively , the gap can be found as @xmath38 and the quasiparticle energy reads @xmath39 with @xmath40 .",
    "the most interesting property of the kane - mele model is that it gives rise to a vanished charge hall conductance but a nonzero quantized spin hall conductance in contrast to the usual quantum hall or quantum anomalous hall effect.@xcite the corresponding quantized spin hall conductance can be readily calculated by @xmath41 where the ( spin ) chern number @xmath42 for each spin part is defined by @xmath43.@xcite for the kane - mele model , the single particle hamiltonian can be rewritten as @xmath44 with @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 being the usual pauli matrices .",

    "we should emphasize that although the effective chern - simons action is used here , it does not imply any fractionalization or nontrivial topological order ( a characteristic signature of the topological order is the ground - state degeneracy depending on the topology of the system . )",
    "because no emergent gauge fields or fractionalized quasiparticles exist in the present case.@xcite    since the effective mass @xmath78 , the above chern - simons action can be simplified to the following form @xmath79.\\label{eq8}\\ ] ]    now , one can see that the quantized spin hall conductance @xmath80 from @xmath81 .",
    "if we reintroduce @xmath82 and charge @xmath71 , this spin hall conductance reads @xmath51 , which reproduces the correct result in terms of spin chern number in the previous subsection .",
    "we note that the existence of the spin hall conductance relies on the existence of the charge degree of freedom since the spin gauge - field @xmath73 couples to the electromagnetic field @xmath72 in the chern - simons action . otherwise , if the elementary particles ( here the electrons ) do not carry charge , their spin hall conductance is obviously zero .",
    "the case here is rather different to the spin quantum hall effect,@xcite whose spin hall conductance does not rely on the charge degree of freedom .",
    "in this section , we will present the full discussion of the antiferromagnetic spin - density - wave state including the mean - field equations , the effective action and the edge - states .      for the case with @xmath83 , in general",
    ", one expects that the antiferromagnetic sdw state to be the stable ground - state of kondo lattice model on the honeycomb lattice due to its bipartite feature.@xcite to study the possible antiferromagnetic ordered state , we assume that no kondo screening exists ( @xmath26 ) while magnetic order parameters @xmath84 are not vanishing in the mean - field hamiltonian eq .",

    "based on such an observation , if the conduction electron part is able to support a quantized spin hall conductance , the obtained antiferromagnetic state should be identified as the topological one . using the same method in the discussion of kane - mele model in the previous section ,",

    "it is also noted that when @xmath113 ( no next - nearest - neighbor hopping ) , the above @xmath100 correctly recovers the value in our previous work.@xcite meanwhile , the low - lying quasiparticle excitations in the antiferromagnetic sdw state have the energy @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "the former corresponds to the conduction electrons while the latter , which is nondispersive , relates to the local spins / pseudofermions .",
    "it should be noted that the gap around the dirac points only closes when the condition @xmath116 is fully satisfied .",
    "otherwise , any low - lying quasiparticle excitations in the antiferromagnetic sdw state are clearly gapped .",
    "thus , we may conclude that the antiferromagnetic sdw state we obtained is mainly an insulating state ( except for the case with @xmath116 ) with fully polarized local spins ( @xmath109 ) while conduction electrons only partially polarize ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "this feature is similar to the previous study on square lattice , thus confirms the validity of our current treatment.@xcite    furthermore , since we have calculated the order parameter @xmath109 , according to the discussion in the previous paragraph , the spin chern numbers are found as @xmath118 .",
    "therefore , when @xmath119 , we have @xmath50 and the spin hall conductance is quantized to @xmath120 , which has the identical value to the kane - mele model . considering",
    "that this state also has antiferromagnetic sdw long - ranged ordered state , we may call it topological sdw ( t - sdw ) state . in contrast , when @xmath121 , the spin chern numbers vanish and we only have a normal sdw ( n - sdw ) state .",
    "there also exists a particular point where @xmath122 .",

    "in contrast , when @xmath134 is smaller than @xmath135 , no such quantized spin hall conductance can be found and the corresponding effective chern - simon term vanishes .",
    "therefore , it seems that even in the antiferromagnetic sdw state , there exists a quantized spin hall conductance if the quasiparticle gap is still dominated by the next - nearest neighbor hopping ( @xmath134 ) rather than the antiferromagnetic order ( @xmath135 ) .",
    "thus , we have uncovered a topological antiferromagnetic sdw state , namely , the t - sdw state with a quantum spin hall effect for @xmath136 .",

    "interestingly , the authors in ref . report a ferromagnetic state with a nonzero spin chern number , which seems a new topological state like the t - sdw state found in the present paper , namely a state with both the magnetic order and a quantized charge or spin chern number / hall conductance .",
    "to our knowledge , there does not exist any numerical studies on the kane - mele - kondo lattice or the kane - mele - anderson lattice model up to now .",
    "the kane - mele - kondo lattice model is defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and the kane - mele - anderson lattice model is defined as@xcite @xmath260 where @xmath23 is the hybridization between conduction electrons @xmath261 and local electrons @xmath262 , which is a free parameter in the anderson lattice model .",
    "@xmath263 denotes the local energy level of local electrons and @xmath181 is the usual local hubbard repulsive energy , which represents the local strong correlation feature of local electrons .    in literature , the kane - mele model with hubbard-@xmath181 interaction , i.e. , the kane - mele - hubbard model , is widely studed by various numerical techniques such as auxiliary field quantum monte carlo,@xcite variational cluster,@xcite variational monte carlo@xcite and cellular dynamical mean - field theory .",
    "@xcite we expect that since the kane - mele - anderson lattice is not very different from the kane - mele - hubbard model , those numerical techniques may be utilized to capture the ground - state phase diagram and many correlation functions though the kane - mele - anderson lattice has larger hilbert space than the kane - mele - hubbard model ( note that there exist two kinds of electrons , the conduction and local electrons in kane - mele - anderson lattice while only conduction electrons appear in the kane - mele - hubbard model ) .",
    "recently , the kondo insulator samarium hexaboride smb@xmath2 , which is proposed as a promising candidate for the topological kondo insulator , is hotly studied by many experimental groups.@xcite we note that smb@xmath2 is basically a three - dimensional material , thus our theoretical results can not be directly applied to this interesting example .",
    "materials relevant to our theoretical results should be certain quasi - two - dimensional compounds with strong spin - orbit coupling and strong local interactions .",
    "particularly , if their lattice is the honeycomb lattice , it will be a good chance to compare the experimental results to the theoretical predictions , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .    since there have no realistic materials , which could be well modeled by the kane - mele - kondo lattice model , we have to expect the versatile ultra - cold atoms systems may realize our proposed model on the honeycomb lattice.@xcite      till now , the theoretical study of the topological kondo states is only focused on the topological kondo insulator though we know that even the most promising topological kondo insulator material smb@xmath2 can also show an antiferromagnetic state under external pressure .",
    "thus , it is interesting to theoretically discuss the transition from the putative topological kondo insulator to the antiferromagnetic ordered state in certain three - dimensional lattice models .",
    "recalling that the topological kondo insulator is described by the anderson lattice models in refs . and , introducing a heisenberg exchange interaction between the spin degree of freedom of local spins may include the effect of magnetism into the original models .",
    "in summary , we have obtained the ground - state phase diagram of the kane - mele - kondo lattice model on the honeycomb lattice at half - filling .",
    "it is found that the paramagnetic kondo insulator and the magnetic normal and topological antiferromagnetic spin - density - wave states occupy the regimes of the phase diagram while the quantum spin hall insulator is excluded .",
    "the topological magnetic state has the same symmetry as the normal one but it has an extra quantized spin hall conductance and a nontrivial helical edge - state .",
    "interestingly , those topological properties can be captured in terms of a mutual chern - simons theory and the stability of the helical edge - state is protected by recovered time - reversal symmetry .",
    "furthermore , there exists a novel topological quantum phase transition between the two kinds of magnetic phases , whose critical behaviors may be described by a three - dimensional quantum electrodynamics .",
    "in addition , a first - order quantum phase transition is found between the kondo insulating state and the antiferromagnetic states .",
    "we hope the present work may be helpful for further studies on the interplay between conduction electrons and the densely localized spins on the honeycomb lattice .",
    "the work was supported partly by nsfc , pcsirt ( grant no .",
    "irt1251 ) , the program for ncet , the fundamental research funds for the central universities and the national program for basic research of china .",
    "here , we would like to give a brief derivation of the effective chern - simons action eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) from the dirac action eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) but without the spin gauge - field @xmath73 . introducing the spin gauge - field is easy to implement as just a replacement ( @xmath264 ) .",
