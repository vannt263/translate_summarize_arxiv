    "wide - field imaging surveys over the last decade have been successful in uncovering free - floating brown dwarfs at progressively cooler temperatures .",
    "however , the relatively low surface density of field brown dwarfs on the sky @xcite necessitates imaging of very large areas and spectroscopy of samples of candidates that can be highly contaminated . a survey for companions to stars in the solar neighborhood ( @xmath13  pc ) is an appealing alternative for identifying the coolest brown dwarfs because of the smaller search volume that is required .",
    "in addition , the age , distance , and metallicity measured for a primary can be adopted for its companion , parameters which are usually difficult or impossible to measure for isolated brown dwarfs .",

    "for each nearby star , we used the task _ starfind _ within iraf to measure positions for all point sources in the images from the multiple epochs .",
    "we converted the pixel coordinates to equatorial coordinates using the world coordinate systems produced by the pipeline and matched the source lists between the epochs .",
    "we then measured a new world coordinate system for the first epoch image using the pixel coordinates from the first epoch and the equatorial coordinates from the second epoch , which enabled more accurate relative astrometry between the two epochs . to identify possible companions , we checked for sources with motions that were consistent with the motions measured for the primaries from these data .",
    "if accurate positions were unavailable for the primary because of saturation in the irac data , we instead computed the motion expected for the primary based on its published proper motion and the elapsed time between the two epochs .",
    "we have identified a new companion to the dq white dwarf wd  0806 - 661 ( l97 - 3 ) , which we refer to as wd  0806 - 661  b. the primary was observed by irac on 2004 december 15 and 2009 august 24 through programs 2313 ( m. kuchner ) and 60161 ( m. burleigh ) with total exposure times of 134 and 536  s , respectively .",

    "the motion of wd  0806 - 661  b between the two epochs of irac data agrees closely with that of the primary , and is significantly greater than the zero motion expected for a background source .",

    "we also estimate a mass of @xmath4  @xmath5 for wd  0806 - 661  b from the evolutionary models . given that cloud core fragmentation appears capable of making binary companions near this mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it seems likely that a companion of this kind in a very large orbit ( 2500  au ) would have formed in this manner .",
    "however , the mass estimate also falls within the range of masses measured for close - in extrasolar planets ( @xmath38  @xmath5 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "because the progenitor of the primary was fairly massive ( @xmath6  @xmath7 ) , its circumstellar disk at birth could have been massive enough to give rise to a companion at this mass .",
    "thus , wd  0806 - 661  b could be a giant planet that has been dynamically scattered to a larger orbit .",
    "spectroscopy and multi - band photometry are necessary to verify the substellar nature of wd  0806 - 661  b and to better estimate its physical properties . if confirmed as the coolest known brown dwarf , it will represent a valuable laboratory for studying atmospheres in a new temperature regime , and its colors will help to guide searches for the coldest brown dwarfs with facilities like the wide - field infrared survey explorer and the james webb space telescope .",
