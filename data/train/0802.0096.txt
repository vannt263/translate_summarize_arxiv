    "the university of new south wales ( unsw ) is conducting a wide - field survey for transiting extrasolar planets , and is one of an increasing number teams around the world using this method .",
    "the nature of wide - field surveys has resulted in an enormous number of high - precision light curves being produced , numbering in the millions for some teams ( e.g. @xcite ) .    in order to maximise the output efficiency from wide - field surveys , it is important to make the data available for use in other studies once planet candidates have been identified .",
    "the most extensive results produced by these projects to date have been long lists of newly discovered variable stars , inevitably with very limited information apart from the period and amplitude in a single band @xcite .",
    "therefore , one can imagine the main use of these variable star catalogues is to define starting samples for astrophysically interesting follow - up studies that benefit from large samples of carefully selected stars .",
    "a recent example is the list of variable stars coincident with x - ray sources presented by @xcite .",
    "the unsw extrasolar planet search is performed with the largest clear aperture telescope of the wide - field transit surveys . with a diameter of 0.5-m ,",
    "this project occupies the niche between the typical wide - field transit surveys observing brighter targets with 0.10.2-m diameter telescopes , and the deeper surveys with narrower fields of view using @xmath41-m diameter telescopes .",
    "the larger collecting area in this project has been exploited to increase the acquisition rate for the observations , as compared to observing deeper targets , since brighter targets have a higher potential for interesting follow - up studies .",
    "the large data set of light curves we have obtained is therefore the ideal starting point from which to compile a bright variable star catalogue of particularly well - sampled light curves with high precision photometry and moderately long observing baselines ( 14 months ) .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "section [ sec : obs ] describes the observations and reduction pipeline .",
    "section [ sec : sel ] describes the methods by which the variable light curves were selected .",
    "the final catalogue is presented in section [ sec : res ] , while three possible applications of the sample are discussed in section [ sec : dis ] .",
    "the data are publicly available at the university of new south wales virtual observatory ( vo ) facility , which is described in section  [ sec : online ] .",
    "we close the main body of the paper with a short summary of the project in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "cross - references to the general catalogue of variable stars ( gcvs ) and the all sky automated survey ( asas ) database are given in the appendix .",
    "the data were obtained using the dedicated 0.5-m automated patrol telescope at siding spring observatory , australia .",
    "observing is performed remotely on every clear night when the moon is not full and is almost entirely automated ; the observer initiates the observing script and monitors the weather conditions .",
    "the ccd camera used for these observations consists of an eev ccd05 - 20 chip , with @xmath5 pixels .",
    "the pixel size of 22.5  @xmath6 m produces a relatively low spatial resolution of 9.4  arcsec pixel@xmath7 , and the field of view of each image is @xmath8  deg@xmath9 .",
    "the observations were taken through a johnson @xmath10 filter , a decision designed to maximise the contribution to the photometry of later spectral type dwarf stars , around which it is easier to detect transiting planets .",
    "a new ccd camera covering @xmath11  deg@xmath9 with a higher spatial resolution of 4.19  arcsec pixel@xmath7 has been constructed for this project and will be installed on the telescope in 2008 .",
    "observations were obtained for 32 months from 2004 october to 2007 may on 25 target fields , listed in table [ tab : fields ] , resulting in a total sky coverage of @xmath12 deg@xmath9 .",
    "the equatorial coordinates of the centre of each field is given , as are the galactic coordinates .",
    "the strategy employed for field selection was again motivated by transit detection .",
    "the most southerly fields were chosen in order to reduce the airmass variations over the course of the night , with a maximum allowable declination of 70  due to building constraints . at the same time , the galactic latitude was constrained to @xmath13  to alleviate crowding effects in the field , which led to several more northern fields being selected .",
    "this latter constraint was relaxed for the final field in order to observe a more crowded stellar field .",
    "most of the fields were observed in pairs in order to increase the number of target stars , with observations alternating between the two fields over the course of the night . for the majority of the fields",
    "the rate of acquisition is 15 images per hour , however for the first pair of fields it is half as often as this .",
    "for the final three fields we implemented an automated script that adjusted the exposure times according to the sky brightness levels , and the rate of acquisition ranges from 1040 images per hour .",
    "these fields were also observed singly instead of pairwise , which accounts for the higher rates achieved . each field",
    "was observed for a minimum of 20 nights for at least @xmath14 hours per night , resulting in @xmath15 observed data points for each star .",
    "each field contained @xmath16 stars with @xmath17 , depending on the galactic coordinates .",
    "the numbers of stars observed down to 14@xmath18 magnitude in each field are included in table [ tab : fields ] , with @xmath0  light curves being generated .",
    ".details of the target fields observed with the automated patrol telescope .",
    "the columns for each field are as follows : the field name , the coordinates and galactic latitude of the centre of the field , the total observations obtained , the number of stars in each field brighter than @xmath19 magnitude , and the number of images obtained per hour .",
