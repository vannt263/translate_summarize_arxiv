    "the prediction  @xcite and realization  @xcite of topological insulators  materials with an insulating bulk and robust , metallic surface states  a decade ago set off an explosion of interest in topological phases of matter  @xcite . since then , new insulating , semimetallic , and metallic phases with nontrivial topology have been proposed and investigated  @xcite .",
    "however , the majority of these efforts has been theoretical . in the case of 3d topological insulators , only a few families of compounds  all of which are lead and/or bismuth chalcogenides  with substantial band gaps have been synthesized and experimentally verified  @xcite , and of those only bismuth selenide has been widely studied .",
    "bi@xmath0se@xmath1 appears ideal in theory : it is a simple , binary compound that is easily grown and has a band gap of about 300mev .",
    "however , it is plagued by defects that render the bulk conductive , preventing straightforward utilization and investigation of surface states  @xcite . while these can be ameliorated in principle by careful alloying , implementation of this strategy",
    "is still ongoing  @xcite .",
    "significant progress remains to be made for topological insulators to be technologically viable .",
    "it is therefore highly advantageous to expand the portfolio of viable compounds . here",
    "we present a new wide - gap topological insulator , a binary compound that is not a lead or bismuth chalcogenide : basn@xmath0 .",
    "little is known about barium stannide ; the published phase diagram for ba - sn is incomplete and does not contain information about the stability of binary phases near the basn@xmath0 composition at high temperatures  @xcite .",
    "the only reported observation of the the compound indicates that it forms from the elements under typical synthesis conditions for sn - based materials and that it crystallizes in the euge@xmath0-type hexagonal structure comprising corrugated sn layers ( fig .",
    "[ fig : struct ] )  @xcite .",
    "our recent density functional theory ( dft ) investigation of metal distannides showed that a fully connected 3d sn framework expected to be stable in nasn@xmath0 is effectively broken up by the large ba atoms into a stacking layers of buckled stanene  itself a two dimensional topological insulator  @xcite  in basn@xmath0  @xcite .",
    "preliminary calculations of the bulk band structure and @xmath2 invariants revealed a potential for basn@xmath0 to display topologically non - trivial behavior@xcite .",
    "our present dft calculations with more accurate treatment of the excited states demonstrate that the material is indeed a strong topological insulator and predict a bulk band gap of 360 mev , placing it among the widest known  @xcite .",
    "we characterize the electronic structure , including the surface states and their variation with surface chemistry .",
    "additionally , we explore the surrounding space of the phase diagram experimentally and computationally to reveal synthesis conditions promoting formation of basn@xmath0 for future investigation of the compound s topological properties .",
    "we establish basn@xmath0 to be a low - temperature phase that does not grow directly from liquid flux .",
    "band structure and surface calculations were performed using  quantum espresso , using pbe  @xcite and the hse  @xcite hybrid functional , the latter of which has been demonstrated to offer significantly improved descriptions of semiconductors  @xcite .",
    "bulk calculations were done on a @xmath3 k - point grid ; the q - point grid for the exact exchange was @xmath3 as well .",
    "calculations for slabs of eleven basn@xmath0 layers were performed at the level of pbe on @xmath4 k - point grids with at least 10  of vaccuum . in all cases ,",
    "the energy cutoff was 50ry .",
    "hse band structures were obtained using wannier interpolation via wannier90  @xcite .",
    "the stability analysis was carried out with vasp@xcite at the level of pbe , using the projector augmented wave method  @xcite and a 500 ev cut - off .",
    "fine meshes were used to ensure numerical convergence of relative energies to within 1 - 2 mev / atom .",
    "vibrational contributions to free energy at elevated temperatures were found with the frozen phonon method as implemented in phon @xcite . as in our previous study of metal stannides @xcite",
    ", we considered a set of known structures in this and related @xmath5-sn binaries at the ambient pressure and carried out unconstrained evolutionary searches at select compositions using maise package @xcite.structure images were created using vesta  @xcite . for the single crystal growth , high purity ( @xmath6% ) ba and sn",

    "[ fig : bulkbands ] shows the band structures computed with both pbe and hse functionals .",
    "it was shown previously  @xcite that the density of states near the band edge resides primarily in the covalent tin networks in each layer , so that the large barium atoms serve to control and mediate the weak but significant interlayer interactions evinced by the band structure .",
    "with pbe , the band gap is indirect and almost exactly zero , with the conduction band at m falling to the fermi energy .",
    "a topological band inversion , confirmed by calculation of the @xmath2 invariant using parity eigenvalues  @xcite , is apparent at a=@xmath10 , where pockets appear in the both the valence and conduction bands .",
    "inversion at a rather than @xmath11 is unique ; all other verified strong 3d topological insulators invert at @xmath11 . away from a the direct gap",
    "narrows to approximately 200mev .",
    "the hse calculation reveals a significantly improved situation .",
    "the conduction band at m is shifted well - clear of the fermi energy , so that the material is now an insulator .",
    "furthermore , the direct gap increases to approximately 360mev near a.    at the point of inversion a , the band structure appears to exhibit the characteristic signature of inversion , where the effective masses of the homo and lumo bands change sign .",
    "however , more careful analysis reveals that these are not the relevant inverted bands .",
    "the parity eigenvalues are both negative at a , indicating that this inversion is not the topological one .",
    "the next even - parity band sits approximately 1ev above the fermi level ; it is this band that exchanges ordering with the homo at a. this is reinforced by inspecting the wavefunctions directly at @xmath11 and a ( fig .  [ fig : inversion ] ) ; we see that the indicated valence(conduction ) band at @xmath11 possesses the same orbital character as the marked conduction(valence ) band at a. we note that the valence band at @xmath11 and the conduction band at a are both dominated by @xmath12-like tin orbitals ; however , while at @xmath11 these hybridize with ba @xmath13 orbitals , such hybridization is symmetry forbidden at a , where both the conduction and valence states indicate effectively isolated stanene layers .",
    "this suggests that we can understand the topological insulating state in basn@xmath0 as originating from the interactions between stanene layers : the relevant bands in isolated stanene are inverted at @xmath11 of the 2d brillouin zone , making it a quantum spin hall insulator .",
    "a 3d system of widely separated , non - interacting layers will thus have the band inversions at @xmath11 and a. then , if the barium and additional tin layers are brought into proximity , the interlayer interaction uninverts the bands at @xmath11 , but is is forbidden to do so at a , resulting in a single band inversion in the 3d system and a strong topological index .      a direct consequence of the band inversion that occurs in the bulk is the appearance of metallic states localized to the interface between the topological insulator and a trivial insulator ( such as vacuum ) .",
    "they take the form of a dirac cone pinned to a time - reversal invariant momentum that can not be gapped without breaking time - reversal symmetry or closing the bulk gap . however , while the _ existence _ of these states is guaranteed , their detailed characteristics depend on the surface structure and chemistry . unlike bi@xmath0se@xmath1  @xcite , and similar to tlbise@xmath0  @xcite , basn@xmath0 s layers do not form weakly - interacting , quasi - independent units that suggest a natural cleavage plane .",
    "the barium and tin layers have nominal charges of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively ; no simple cut will avoid uncompensated charge .",
    "surface termination will thus strongly impact the surface states , as the chemical environment of the surface layers are modified by the disruption of the bulk .",
    "furthermore , real surfaces are complicated and environment dependent , even in the relatively simple case of bismuth selenide  @xcite .",
    "however , this also allows for the possibility of deliberate manipulation . in conventional semiconductors",
    ", surfaces are often passivated by adsorption of additional species or formation of interfaces  @xcite . in topological insulators",
    ", it has been suggested that surface states can also be controlled using adsorbates  @xcite and heterogeneous surface layers  @xcite .",
    "understanding the surface states of basn@xmath0 will therefore require special consideration of the impact of chemical environment .",
    "first , we compute the surface states using the tight - binding model , for which terminating the surfaces is straightforward , generated using the wannier functions computed for the bulk .",
    "we compare the pbe and hse cases here as well . in fig .",
    "[ fig : tb - slab ] the surfaces of 50 layer slabs are shown for both levels of theory .",
    "ideally , well - defined dirac cones would appear in the bulk gap at an energy uncrossed by other bands . in the present case , the topologically required surface states are clearly visible near @xmath11 and appear well - confined to the surface .",
    "however , they are afflicted by two issues .",
    "first , there is weak splitting of the valence and conduction surface bands away from @xmath11 , so that the dirac cones are only just identifiable as such .",
    "second , the bands experience significant dispersion , driving them below the bulk gap , leaving the degeneracy at @xmath11 below the surface valence band maximum , as occurs at the surface of bi@xmath0te@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "both of these effects are substantially less severe in the model derived from the hse calculations .    to investigate the impact of a real surface on the dirac - cone surface states , we compute and examine the electronic structure of slabs with three simple terminations representing different chemical environments , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dft - slab ] .    in the first case",
    ", we consider termination at the barium layer . to avoid doping the system , either half - filling of the surface sites or substitution with an alkali metal , as has been proposed in mgb@xmath0  @xcite , is required .",
    "calculations of both produce similar results ; we present the latter , using potassium in place of barium , for ease of comparison .",
    "the resulting surface states are of very poor quality , magnifying the problems observed using the model surface .",
    "the surface states well within the valence bulk , and there is almost no splitting of the surface valence and conduction bands . in the second case , we consider a full - layer barium termination passivated by chlorine .",
    "the surface states are much improved , appearing very similar to the model calculation .",
    "we note that oxygen , as part of an oxide layer or hydroxide ion , may be expected to provided a similar chemical environment . finally , we terminate with a stanene layer , passivated by a layer of thallium .",
    "this raises the degeneracy at @xmath11 into the conduction band , so that it is only slightly below the maximum of the surface valence band .",
    "the splitting of the surface bands is quite large as well .",
    "supposing that the impact of the hse functional observed in the model calculation represents physics that will also apply in the present cases , we consider it highly plausible that the true surface state can , in principle , be made to lie in the bulk gap at a fermi energy uncrossed by states elsewhere in the brillouin zone",
    ".    the above progression can be understood by considering the impact of outer - shell , non - bonding electrons in the vicinity of the topmost stanene layer .",
    "thallium has a shallow , filled @xmath16-orbital that significantly raises the energy of the proximal tin states .",
    "chlorine has a weaker impact , sitting above the barium layer , mimicking the effect of the tin that occupies the corresponding site in the bulk , and explaining the similarity between its resulting surface bands and those from the model .",
    "pure barium , however , has no shallow filled states , resulting in tin states lying very low in energy .",
    "this suggests that the best results are likely to be obtained for stanene - terminated surfaces or interfaces including electron - rich species .",
    "we stress that these calculations are primarily to demonstrate the variation possible in surface state quality depending on termination and surface treatment ; identifying and optimizing realistic surface chemistries will require the investigation , both theoretically and experimentally , of significantly more configurations in terms of both composition and structure .",
    "basn@xmath0 was originally obtained by fusing ba and sn at 1120 k @xcite .",
    "the long annealing at 770 k needed to isolate basn@xmath0 crystals and the presence of basn@xmath1 byproduct indicate unfavorable thermodynamics or kinetics governing the compound s formation .",
    "our following dft analysis clarifies the thermodynamic stability of bulk basn@xmath0 under various @xmath17 conditions .",
    "formation energy results at @xmath18 k and @xmath19 gpa in fig .",

    "based on the gibbs energy dependence in fig .",
    "[ fig : phases1](b ) , hp3-basn@xmath0 is indeed destabilized at temperatures above 550 k. in order to have the possibility to grow single crystals out of liquid the transition temperature should be at least close to the liquidus line which is , unfortunately , difficult to establish in this case . experimentally , the liquidus line around this sn - rich stoichiometry has yet to be mapped out  @xcite .",
    "computationally , the transition temperature estimates in dft approximations are prone to large systematic errors @xcite ; e.g. , our local density approximation @xcite calculations indicate that hp3-basn@xmath0 is already unstable by 14 mev / atom at @xmath18 k.     k. circles and diamonds show the results at 0 gpa and 6 gpa , respectively .",

    "we used initial compositions with ba : sn ratios of 37:63 , 33:67 , and 30:70 . in all cases the final product , after being cooled and spun down , was polycrystalline ba@xmath1sn@xmath20(space group : @xmath23 , no . :",

    "no signature of basn@xmath0 was observed , which suggests that near the stoichiometry range of basn@xmath0 , this phase is not connected to the ba - sn liquidous line .",
    "hence , it does not seem possible to grow basn@xmath0 single crystals from ba - sn liquid by flux method .",
    "crystals and sn flux obtained from ba@xmath25sn@xmath26 growth ( black line ) and powder xrd after low temperature annealing showing appearence of basn@xmath0 phase ( red line ) .",

    "this indicates that basn@xmath0 is a low temperature phase hidden beneath basn@xmath1 phase and forms via slow low temperature decomposition of the basn@xmath1 phase .    a common approach to stabilizing certain phases only marginally stable under ambient conditions is application of hydrostatic pressure @xcite .",
    "with a large measured interlayer distance of 5.515  , hp3-basn@xmath0 happens to have a relatively large volume per atom ( 36.4 @xmath29/atom ) compared to the average one ( 32.9 @xmath29/atom ) for the hp8-basn@xmath1 and os32-ba@xmath1sn@xmath20 mixture . as a result ,",
    "the enthalpic @xmath30 term quickly destabilizes hp3-basn@xmath0 ( fig .",

    "[ fig : phases1](b ) ) and should reduce the transition pressure by @xmath31 gpa at synthesis temperatures around 600 k.        based on this finding , an unconventional two - step route can be suggested for obtaining the desired hp3 polymorph .",
    "if hp12 does form at high pressures and can be quenched down to ambient conditions it might be a more suitable starting material for producing crystalline hp3 .",

    "the desired rearrangement of the 3d sn framework in hp12 ( fig .",
