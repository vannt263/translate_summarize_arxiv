    "nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) allows information to be relayed through magnetic nuclei in a non - destructive and powerful approach to structural elucidation .",
    "it is a fundamental tool in a broad range of scientific disciplines and is a cornerstone of modern spectroscopy .",
    "nmr spectra yield a wealth of information , the most commonly reported property being the chemical shift .",
    "this parameter relates an externally applied magnetic field to the resulting change in the local electronic environment of the magnetic nuclei , thereby providing key insight into the underlying atomic structure .",
    "nmr j - coupling or indirect nuclear spin - spin coupling is an indirect interaction of the nuclear magnetic moments mediated by the bonding electrons .",
    "it is manifested as the fine - structure in nmr spectra , providing a direct measure of bond - strength and a map of the connectivities of the system .",
    "the j - coupling mechanism is an essential component of many nmr experiments.@xcite    in solution - state , j - coupling measurements can often be obtained from one dimensional spectra where the multiplet splitting in the peaks is clearly resolved .",
    "however , in the solid - state this is not the case as these splittings are typically obscured by the broadenings from anisotropic interactions .",
    "fortunately this technical challenge has not prevented the determination of j - coupling in the solid - state , as recent work employing spin - echo magic angle spinning ( mas ) techniques@xcite has resulted in accurate measurements of j - coupling in both inorganic materials@xcite and molecular crystals.@xcite in combination with the advances in solid - state experiments , there has also been an increased interest from the biomolecular community as j - coupling has been found to be a direct measure of hydrogen bond strength.@xcite both of these factors have provided a strong impetus to develop first principles approaches to compute the nmr j - coupling constants in order to support experimental work , particularly for solid - state systems .    for finite systems , nmr parameters , including both chemical shifts and j - couplings ,",
    "can be routinely calculated using traditional quantum chemistry approaches based on localised orbitals.@xcite such calculations have been widely applied to assign the solution - state nmr spectra of molecular systems and establish key conformational and structural trends.@xcite in particular nmr j - couplings have been used to quantify hydrogen bonding@xcite in biological systems . in order to apply these techniques to solid - state nmr , it is necessary to devise finite clusters of atoms which model the local environment around a site of interest in the true extended structure .",
    "while this has led to successful studies of nmr chemical shifts in systems such as molecular crystals,@xcite supra - molecular assemblies@xcite and organo - metallic compounds,@xcite it is clear that there are advantages in an approach that inherently takes account of the long - range electrostatic effects in extended systems .",
    "this observation has led to the recent development of the gauge including projector augmented wave ( gipaw)@xcite method which enables nmr parameters to be calculated at all - electron accuracy within the planewave - pseudopotential formalism@xcite of density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "the technique has been applied , in combination with experimental nmr spectroscopy , to systems such as minerals,@xcite glasses@xcite and molecular crystals.@xcite    in this paper we introduce a theory to compute nmr j - couplings in extended systems using periodic boundary conditions and supercells with the planewave - pseudopotential approach . like the gipaw approach to calculating nmr chemical shifts ,",
    "our method is formulated within the planewave - pseudopotential framework using density functional perturbation theory ( dfpt ) .",
    "we use the projector - augmented - wave@xcite ( paw ) reconstruction technique to calculate j - couplings with all - electron accuracy .    in the following section we discuss the physical mechanism of the indirect spin - spin interaction , the basis of the paw approach and the supercell technique . in sections",
    "[ sec : mag ] and [ sec : cur ] we show how the j - coupling tensor maybe be calculated using paw and dfpt .",
    "the method has been implemented in a parallel plane - wave electronic structure code and we discuss details of the implementation and provide validation results in section [ sec : res ] .",
    "we consider the interaction of two nuclei , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , with magnetic moments , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , mediated by the electrons . the first complete analysis of this indirect coupling was provided by ramsey@xcite who decomposed the interaction into four distinct physical mechanisms ; two involving the interaction of the nuclear spins through the electron spin and two through the electron charge . in the absence of spin - orbit coupling i.e , for relatively light elements",
    ", the charge and spin interactions can be treated separately .",
    "we can write the magnetic field at atom @xmath4 induced by the magnetic moment of atom @xmath3 as @xmath7\\,{\\rm d}^{3}{\\bf r } \\nonumber \\\\                            & + & \\frac{\\mu_{0}}{4\\pi}\\frac{8\\pi}{3}\\int { \\bf m}^{(1)}({\\bf r } ) \\delta({\\bf r}_{{\\rm l}})\\,{\\rm d}^{3}{\\bf r } \\nonumber \\\\                            & + & \\frac{\\mu_{0}}{4\\pi}\\int { \\bf j}^{(1)}({\\bf r})\\times \\frac{{\\bf r}_{{\\rm l}}}{|{\\bf r}_{{\\rm l}}|^{3}}\\,{\\rm d}^{3}{\\bf r}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the position of nucleus @xmath4 , @xmath10 is the permeability of a vacuum and @xmath11 is the dirac delta function .",
    "@xmath5 interacts with the electron spin through a magnetic field generated by a fermi - contact term , which is due to the finite probability of the presence of an electron at the nucleus , and a spin - dipolar interaction . both of these terms give rise to a first order spin magnetisation density , @xmath12 .",
    "this magnetisation density then induces a magnetic field at the receiving nucleus by the same mechanisms , which in this case are given respectively by the first and second terms of eqn .",
    "[ eq : b_ind ] .",
    "the interaction between @xmath13 and the electronic charge gives rise to an induced current density . to first - order this",
    "is given by @xmath14 and can be divided into a paramagnetic and a diamagnetic contribution .",
    "the j - coupling tensor , @xmath15 , between @xmath4 and @xmath3 , can be related to the induced field by @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the gyromagnetic ratios of nuclei @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "although the physical interpretation of j - coupling is simplified by considering the interaction in terms of a responding and a perturbing nucleus , it is a symmetric coupling and either atom @xmath4 or @xmath3 can be considered as the perturbing site .",
    "experimental interest is focused primarily on the isotropic coupling constant , @xmath19 , which is obtained from the trace of @xmath20 and is measured in hz .",
    "the superscript , @xmath21 , denotes the order of the coupling in terms of the number of bonds separating the coupled nuclei . in a typical nmr experiment j - coupling",

    "the use of pseudopotentials generates a complication as the j - coupling tensor depends critically on the wavefunction in the regions close to the perturbing and receiving nuclei , precisely the regions where the pseudo - wavefunctions have a non - physical form . to compensate for this we perform an all - electron reconstruction of the valence wavefunctions in the core region using blchl s projector augmented wave ( paw ) scheme.@xcite    within this scheme ,",
    "the expectation value of an operator @xmath25 , applied to the all - electron wavefunctions , @xmath26 , is expressed in terms of the pseudised wavefunctions , @xmath27 , as : @xmath28 . here , for an all - electron local or semi - local operator , @xmath25 ,",

    "this allows us to use the standard technique of constructing supercells from the unit cell which are large enough to inhibit the interaction between the periodic defects or perturbations .",
    "this corresponds to extending the system - size to facilitate the decay of the induced magnetisation and current densities within the simulation cell .",
    "[ fig : supercell ] is a schematic of a @xmath38 supercell constructed from eight unit cells .",
    "the perturbing atom now lies at the corner of a much larger cell which decreases the interaction between the perturbation and its periodic image .",
    "this approach works very well for localised properties such as j - coupling . to calculate the j - coupling for molecules",

    "we now obtain the contribution to the j - coupling tensor which arises from the interaction of the nuclear spins mediated by the electron spin .",
    "we first obtain an expression for the pseudo - hamiltonian in the presence of a perturbing nuclear spin and show how it can be used to obtain the induced magnetisation density .",
    "we then use the magnetisation density to calculate the magnetic field induced at the receiving nucleus .",
    "the all - electron hamiltonian for a system containing @xmath40 magnetic moments which interact through the electron spin , @xmath41 , is expanded to first order in the magnetic moment of the perturbing site , @xmath5 , to give @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 @xmath45 is the magnetic field generated by a spin - dipole interaction , @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the fermi contact interaction , @xmath48 we have defined @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the position of nucleus @xmath3 and @xmath51 is the identity matrix . here @xmath52 is the ground - state all - electron local potential and @xmath53 is the corresponding first order variation .",
    "the latter term is due to the change in magnetisation density induced by @xmath54",
    ". the perturbation does not give rise to a first order change in the charge density and so there is no change in the hartree potential for linear order .",
    "this can be understood by considering the effect of time reversal ; the charge density is even under time inversion , while the spin - magnetisation and magnetic field change sign . as a result",
    "the perturbation does not induce a first order change in the charge density , however there is a first order induced spin - magnetisation density . @xmath53 therefore accounts for the first - order variation of the exchange - correlation term which we label as @xmath55 .",
    "we now use the paw transformation ( eqn .",

    "@xmath66 is the fermi - contact operator and can be constructed in a similar manner to the spin - dipole operator giving an all - electron and an augmentation contribution .",
    "however , as the fermi - contact operator contains a dirac delta - function and is therefore localised within the augmentation region , @xmath66 can be simplified considerably . the pseudo - partial waves and projectors , @xmath67 , form a complete set which enables us to rewrite the all - electron contribution in terms of the pseudo - partial waves within the augmentation region and so we can equivalently express the operator as @xmath68 where @xmath69 .",

    "it is clear that the fermi - contact is the dominant mechanism in the coupling and that the diamagnetic component is consistently the smallest and is often negligible .",
    "due to the difficulties encountered measuring j - coupling in solid - state systems there are very few values to be found in the literature that are suitable for validation of our approach .",
    "recently coelho _",

    "subsequently this was followed by a more accurate determination @xcite which identified the four si - o - p couplings .",
    "we have calculated nmr chemical shifts and @xmath161 for si@xmath0o(po@xmath1)@xmath2 to validate our approach .",
    "the structure of si@xmath0o(po@xmath1)@xmath2 is trigonal ( a=7.869 , c=24.138 , 36 atoms per primitive cell ) and contains one unique p site and three inequivalent si sites .",
    "two of these si sites are 6-fold coordinated , si@xmath162 and si@xmath163 , and the third site , si@xmath164 , is four - fold coordinated .",
    "si@xmath162 is bonded to six equivalent oxygen atoms , si@xmath163 is bonded to six oxygen atoms which are comprised of two distinct sites .",
    "si@xmath164 is bonded to three equivalent oxygen atoms and one oxygen from an si@xmath164-o tetrahedron .",
    "thus there is one @xmath160p chemical shift , three @xmath159si chemical shifts and four unique @xmath165j@xmath166 couplings .",
    "we obtained the structure from the chemical database service at daresbury.@xcite prior to calculating the nmr parameters , we performed a full geometry optimisation on the structure , using a planewave cut - off of 70 ryd and norm - conserving pseudopotentials . the gga - pbe@xcite exchange - correlation functional",
    "was used and a monkhorst - pack k - point grid with a maximum of 0.1 @xmath167 between sampling points .",
    "we calculated the nmr chemical shifts using the gipaw@xcite approach with the same parameters used for the geometry optimisation . the j - coupling between p and",
    "si was obtained using the approach outlined above .",
    "a slightly higher maximum planewave energy ( 80ryd ) was required to give j - couplings converged to within 0.1hz .",
    "we tested the convergence of the induced magnetization density and current density with respect to supercell size .",

    "we can see that both the induced magnetization and current densities have decayed substantially within the single unit cell .",
    "the largest of these calculations ( 144 atoms ) was parallelised over 16 dual - core amd processors and took 45 hours to run .",
