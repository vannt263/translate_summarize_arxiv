    "the geometric factor @xmath8 is @xmath9 for a closed universe , @xmath10 for a flat universe , and @xmath11 for an open universe .",
    "the expansion of the universe is calculated from the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) differential equations of motion , @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 derived from an application of the rw metric to the einstein field equations . here , an overdot denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath5 , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 represent , respectively , the total energy density and total pressure .",
    "often , the latter is written as @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is then used to characterize the expansion properties of the medium .",
    "for example , @xmath19 for ( visible and dark ) matter , @xmath20 for radiation , and @xmath11 for a pure cosmological constant ( though the actual value of @xmath18 is not restricted to just these values ) .",
    "in previous papers,@xcite we demonstrated the usefulness of expressing the rw metric in terms of an observer - dependent coordinate @xmath21 , which explicitly reveals the dependence of the observed intervals of distance , @xmath22 , and time on the curvature induced by the mass - energy content between the observer and @xmath23 ; in the metric , this effect is represented by the proximity of the _ physical _ radius @xmath23 to the cosmic horizon @xmath0 , defined by the relation @xmath24 in this expression , @xmath25 is the mass enclosed within @xmath0 . in terms of @xmath15 , we may also write @xmath26 or , more simply , @xmath27 in a flat universe .",
    "this is the radius at which a sphere encloses sufficient mass - energy to create a significant time dilation for an observer at the surface relative to the origin of the coordinates .",
    "when the rw metric is written in terms of @xmath23 , the presence of @xmath0 alters the intervals of time we measure progressively more and more as @xmath3 . and",
    "since the gravitational time dilation becomes infinite near @xmath0 , it is physically impossible for us to see any process occurring beyond this distance . what this means , of course",
    ", is that light emitted beyond @xmath0 is infinitely redshifted and therefore carries no signal .",
    "the motivation for the introduction of these new coordinates was the set of recent observations pointing to a cosmic - horizon radius @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the inferred current age of the universe.@xcite ( throughout this paper , a subscript @xmath10 denotes quantities measured at the present time . )",
    "this inference is based on precision measurements@xcite of the cmb radiation , which indicate that the universe is extremely flat ( i.e. , @xmath30 ) .",
    "thus @xmath15 is at ( or very near ) the  critical \" value @xmath31 .",
    "the hubble space telescope key project@xcite on the extragalactic distance scale has measured @xmath32 with unprecedented accuracy , finding a current value @xmath33 km s@xmath34 mpc@xmath34 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that with this @xmath35 , @xmath36 ( specifically , @xmath37 versus @xmath38 billion lightyears ) .",
    "but this _ empirical _ result is very peculiar because the frw equations predict that @xmath39 only for the very special equation of state @xmath40 which , however , does not appear to be consistent with any of the known constituents of the universe , including a cosmological constant with @xmath41 .    as a brief aside ,",
    "it is interesting to note that de sitter s own metric ( for a universe containing only a cosmological constant ) was first written in terms of observer - dependent coordinates,@xcite though this is no longer widely known , and everyone now uses the form of the rw metric written in terms of @xmath7 and @xmath5 only .",
    "of course , de sitter s work was completed prior to the introduction of the comoving coordinates @xmath42 several years later .",
    "a physical motivation for how one might arrive at de sitter s metric from an application of schwarzschild s solution to a uniform infinite medium may be understood in terms of birkhoff s theorem and its corollary.@xcite    given the significance of the fact that @xmath43 , our earlier discussion on this topic@xcite was largely based on a simple cosmological spacetime with @xmath40 .",
    "the condition @xmath39 is then always true , guaranteeing the equality ( or near equality ) of @xmath0 and @xmath44 .",
    "however , if the equation of state is time dependent , @xmath18 need not be exactly @xmath45 in order to achieve the result @xmath46 in the current universe . indeed , type ia supernova data seem to suggest a value of @xmath18 smaller than this,@xcite which motivates us to consider a broader range of constituents in the universe in order to fully interrogate the available data .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present the transformations required to recast the rw metric and frw equations for a flat universe ( @xmath30 ) into observer - dependent coordinates for several commonly assumed cosmologies .",
    "the overriding motivation is the derivation of an explicit expression for @xmath0 in terms of measurable quantities for each of the cases we consider .",
    "as we shall see , this is a key component required for a complete interpretation of the observations , particularly as they pertain to the nature of dark energy . in the process",
    ", we shall affirm the conclusion drawn earlier@xcite that dark energy is probably not a cosmological constant .",
    "in order to write the rw metric in terms of observer - dependent coordinates , we begin with the physical radius @xmath47 however , it will become evident later that to simplify the mathematical transformations , it is convenient to recast equation ( 1 ) using a new function @xmath48 , where @xmath49 in that case , @xmath50\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath51 now , @xmath52 and therefore @xmath53\\;,\\ ] ] so that @xmath54\\;.\\ ] ]    collecting terms , we can now write the metric as @xmath55\\,c^2\\,dt^2 + 2 \\left(\\frac{r\\dot{f}}{c}\\right ) c\\,dt\\,dr - dr^2 -r^2\\,d\\omega^2\\;,\\ ] ] whereupon , completing the square , we see that @xmath56 ^ 2 - \\phi^{-1}{dr^2}-r^2\\,d\\omega^2\\;.\\ ] ] for convenience we have also defined the quantity @xmath57 which appears frequently in the metric coefficients .",
    "we can easily see that the radius of the cosmic horizon for the observer at the origin is @xmath58 so that , in effect , the function @xmath59 signals the dependence of the metric on the proximity of the observation radius @xmath23 to the maximum observable distance @xmath0 .",
    "equation  ( 14 ) thus becomes @xmath60 ^ 2 - \\phi^{-1}{dr^2}-r^2\\,d\\omega^2\\;.\\ ] ]    this metric is already in a form we can use to examine the behavior of the cosmological spacetime at any radius @xmath23 .",
    "however , sometimes ( e.g. , as in the de sitter metric ) it may be useful to  complete \" the transformation by introducing a new time coordinate @xmath61 , such that @xmath62 where @xmath63 is an integrating factor selected to guarantee that @xmath64 is an exact differential.@xcite there are possibly an infinite number of solutions for @xmath63 , but only one is dimensionless ( ensuring that @xmath61 has dimensions of time ) , while completely diagonalizing the metric . with this substitution , @xmath65 but in order for @xmath64 to be an exact differential , @xmath61 must satisfy the following condition : @xmath66 which means that @xmath63 must be a solution to the equation @xmath67 = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t } \\left[\\left(\\frac{r}{cr_{\\rm h } } \\right)\\ , \\eta(t , r ) \\right]\\;. \\label{mainde}\\ ] ]    as we shall learn shortly , however , the coordinate @xmath61 has only limited applicability because it is rarely possible to integrate @xmath64 starting from the big bang at @xmath68 to the present .",
    "let us now examine the behavior of the interval @xmath2 connecting any arbitrary pair of spacetime events at @xmath23 .",
    "for an interval produced at @xmath23 by the advancement of time only ( with @xmath69 ) , equation  ( 18 ) gives @xmath70 thus , if we were to make a measurement a _ fixed _ distance @xmath23 away from us , the time interval @xmath1 corresponding to any measurable ( non - zero ) value of @xmath2 must go to infinity as @xmath3 .",
    "( in the context of black - hole physics , we recognize this effect as the divergent gravitational redshift measured by a static observer outside the event horizon . )",
    "this result is generic to all cosmologies though , as we shall see , in some cases @xmath0 lies beyond the distance @xmath71 light has traveled since the big bang and is therefore not an observable quantity . what does change from case to case",
    ", however , are the constituents of the universe , which directly determine @xmath18 , and therefore the function @xmath72 and the horizon s radius @xmath0 .",
    "finding these quantities will be the goal of the next section .",
    "but we can already see directly from the frw equations how @xmath0 should behave for any given value of @xmath18 .",
    "it is straightforward to demonstrate@xcite from equations  ( 2)(4 ) that @xmath73 thus , @xmath0 is an increasing function of cosmic time @xmath5 for any cosmology with @xmath74 .",
    "it is fixed only for de sitter , in which @xmath15 is a cosmological constant and @xmath75 . in addition",
    ", there is clearly a demarcation at @xmath40 .",
    "when @xmath76 , @xmath0 increases more slowly than lightspeed , and therefore our universe would be delimited by this horizon because light would have traveled a distance @xmath71 greater than @xmath77 since the big bang . on the other hand , @xmath0 is always greater than @xmath44 when @xmath78 , and our observational limit would then simply be set by the light travel distance @xmath71 .",
    "as we pointed out above , de sitter himself published the earliest form of his metric using the coordinate @xmath23 , though he was apparently not aware of its full significance .",
    "but as a simple , initial application of the method we derived in   2 above , let us repeat this calculation by considering a universe containing only a cosmological constant . in this case",
    ", @xmath80 for which @xmath81 \\;.\\ ] ] clearly , @xmath82=h_0 t\\;,\\ ] ] so @xmath83 thus , inserting this form of @xmath84 into equation  ( 16 ) , we obtain @xmath85    as we saw in equation  ( 24 ) , the de sitter metric is unique among the various cosmologies in that the density @xmath15 is constant , and therefore the radius @xmath86 is fixed for all cosmic time @xmath5 .",
    "however , for all the other cosmologies we will consider below , @xmath74 , so @xmath87 .",
    "this means , of course , that whereas an observer can choose radii @xmath23 that are always smaller than @xmath0 in de sitter , the same is not true when @xmath88 , since for any given @xmath23 , @xmath89 when @xmath90 .",
    "an important consequence of this distinction is that the interval @xmath2 is then imaginary at early times ( since @xmath89 ) for all but the de sitter metric , and @xmath64 can therefore not be integrated starting at @xmath68 .",
    "but for de sitter , we see from equation  ( 18 ) ( since @xmath0 is independent of time ) that @xmath91\\;.\\ ] ] a comparison with equation  ( 19 ) tells immediately that the integrating factor @xmath63 in the case of de sitter is simply equal to @xmath92 , and a straightforward integration of equation  ( 30 ) thus gives @xmath93 at the origin , @xmath61 is of course equal to @xmath5 , but since the gravitationally - induced dilation increases with @xmath23 , @xmath61 also includes the additional redshift seen at progressively greater distances from the observer .",
    "note , however , that for @xmath69 , @xmath94 , so both of these time intervals diverge for a finite @xmath2 as @xmath3 .",
    "written in terms of @xmath61 and @xmath23 , the de sitter metric becomes @xmath95 which is the form originally presented by de sitter.@xcite      this is the case in which @xmath97 in equation ( 24 ) .",
    "aside from being one of the simplest models of the universe that one can construct from the frw equations , it is also motivated by the observed fact that @xmath43 at the present time .",
    "if @xmath18 is always @xmath45 , then it would not be surprising to see @xmath98 now , since this condition would have been true from the beginning .",
    "but though this may seem like a highly idealized model that bears minimal relevance to the real universe , it is actually singularly significant@xcite because an equation of state @xmath40 is the only one for which the current age , @xmath29 , of the universe can equal the light - crossing time , @xmath99 . for any other cosmology with @xmath76 , @xmath29 must be greater than @xmath100 .",
    "we shall return to this shortly .",
    "for now , let us consider the transformation of coordinates when @xmath40 , for which @xmath101 then , @xmath82=\\ln(h_0t)\\;,\\ ] ] and @xmath102    we therefore confirm that @xmath103 in this case , and from equation  ( 18 ) , we obtain the metric @xmath104^{2 } - \\phi^{-1}{dr^2}-r^2\\,d\\omega^2\\;,\\ ] ] with @xmath105 as was the case with de sitter , the cosmic time @xmath1 diverges for a measurable line element as @xmath106 ( which , however , is equal to @xmath44 here ) .",
    "we may also write the metric in terms of @xmath23 and @xmath61 . a dimensionless solution to equation  ( 22 )",
    "is @xmath107 which leads to the metric @xmath108 but as we pointed out above , this form of the metric has only a limited applicability , given that @xmath109 when @xmath89 and @xmath69 .",
    "the real universe may indeed contain a cosmological constant , in which case it approaches a de sitter spacetime asymptotically , given that its other constituents have a density @xmath15 that drops off as @xmath6 increases .",
    "( we will revisit this below . ) but let us now move beyond the simple de sitter application , and the special case with @xmath40 , and consider other cosmological phases ( as we currently understand them ) that may have emerged since the big bang .",
    "in the very beginning , when radiation dominated the equation of state ( with @xmath111 ) , the expansion parameter was given as @xmath112 in that case , @xmath82={1\\over 2}\\ln(2h_0 t)\\;,\\ ] ] and @xmath113 therefore @xmath114 .",
    "in this case , the visible universe ( extending out to @xmath44 ) never reaches @xmath0 , and the metric is @xmath115^{2 } - \\phi^{-1}{dr^2}-r^2\\,d\\omega^2\\;,\\ ] ] with @xmath116 thus , measurements made at a fixed @xmath23 and @xmath117 still produce a gravitationally - induced dilation of @xmath1 as @xmath23 increases , but this effect never becomes divergent within that portion of the universe ( i.e. , within @xmath71 ) that remains observable since the big bang .    for completeness , we note that a dimensionless solution for @xmath63 from equation  ( 22 ) is @xmath118 and the metric written in terms of @xmath23 and @xmath61 is therefore @xmath119 the same restrictions as before pertain to @xmath61 since here also @xmath89 at early times , which would make @xmath2 imaginary for @xmath69 back then .",
    "when @xmath15 is dominated by matter with @xmath121 , the expansion factor grows according to @xmath122 therefore , @xmath82={2\\over 3 } \\ , \\ln\\left({3\\over 2}h_0 t\\right)\\;,\\ ] ] and @xmath123 in this case , the radius of the cosmic horizon is @xmath124 , and the metric becomes @xmath125^{2 } - \\phi^{-1}{dr^2}-r^2\\,d\\omega^2\\;,\\ ] ] with @xmath126 the situation is similar to that for a radiation dominated universe , in that @xmath0 always recedes from us faster than lightspeed ( see equation  24 ) . although dilation is evident with increasing @xmath23 , curvature alone does not produce a divergent redshift .",
    "a dimensionless integrating factor @xmath63 is @xmath127 thus , in terms of @xmath23 and @xmath61 , @xmath128^{-1}\\,c^2\\ , dt^2 -\\phi^{-1}\\,dr^2-r^2\\,d\\omega^2\\;. \\label{matterfinal}\\ ] ]      in general , @xmath130 for a universe with constant @xmath18 .",
    "except for the special cases @xmath75 and @xmath40 , the metric may therefore be written @xmath131^{2 } - \\phi^{-1}{dr^2}-r^2\\,d\\omega^2\\;,\\ ] ] with @xmath132 ( actually , both this form of the metric , as well as that given below in equation  57 , are valid for constant values of @xmath18 greater than @xmath45 . however , in this section we are primarily interested in equations of state for which @xmath133 , i.e. , @xmath76 . ) a cosmology with @xmath76 is therefore delimited by the horizon in the sense that our measurements  extending over a distance @xmath71would have probed regions of spacetime that include @xmath77 today .",
    "for example , in what may be a close approximation to the universe we have currently ( see next subsection ) , the line element for @xmath134 is @xmath135^{2 } - \\phi^{-1}{dr^2}-r^2\\,d\\omega^2\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath136 . in this universe ,",
    "the cosmic horizon would lie at a radius from us only half of the total distance traversed by light since the big bang , and we would therefore be sampling phenomena near the gravitational limit .",
    "it is not difficult to see that the general form of the metric written in terms of @xmath23 and @xmath61 is @xmath137^{(3w-1)/(3w+1 ) } \\,c^2\\,dt^2-\\phi^{-1}\\,dr^2-r^2\\,d\\omega^2\\;.\\ ] ]      let us now examine the role played by @xmath0 in the  standard \" model of cosmology .",
    "following the radiation - dominated era , the universal expansion is believed to have been driven by a combination of matter plus a cosmological constant , the latter emerging at later times since @xmath139 , whereas @xmath140 constant .",
    "based on the solutions we have examined thus far , we anticipate that this kind of universe does become @xmath0-delimited , but only after the cosmological constant dominates .    from the frw equations with @xmath141 and @xmath142 , where @xmath143 and @xmath144 , we infer that @xmath145 the ratio @xmath146",
    "is not known a priori ; its possible range of values is subsumed into the ( time ) constant @xmath147 .",
    "the greater the value of @xmath146 , the greater the value of @xmath147 , pushing the transition from a matter - dominated universe to a @xmath138-dominated one farther into the future .",
    "notice from equation ( 58 ) that @xmath148 for @xmath149 , in agreement with equation  ( 47 ) for a matter - dominated universe . at the other extreme , @xmath150 , the correct behavior exhibited in equation  ( 25 ) for a de sitter universe .",
    "clearly then , @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the asymptotic ( constant ) value of the hubble constant describing a universe settled into its cosmological - constant driven expansion .",
    "thus , in @xmath138cdm cosmology , @xmath82=\\ln(a ) + \\frac{2}{3 } \\ , \\ln\\left[\\sinh ( t / t_{\\lambda})\\right]\\;,\\ ] ] and @xmath153 it is trivial to check that @xmath154 has the correct limiting forms given in equations  ( 28 ) ( when @xmath155 ) and ( 49 ) ( when @xmath90 ) . in this case , @xmath156 and therefore @xmath157c\\;.\\ ] ] a direct comparison of this equation for @xmath158 with that given in equation ( 24 ) is not quite legitimate since @xmath18 was assumed to be constant in the earlier expression .",
    "however , for simple analysis over short intervals of time @xmath159 , it can still be useful to approximate @xmath18 as follows : @xmath160 which again has the correct behavior in the appropriate time limits , i.e. , @xmath161 when @xmath90 and @xmath162 when @xmath155 .",
    "in this cosmology , the observer does not experience a divergent redshift with increasing @xmath23 at early times , since @xmath163 then , but he will begin to encounter an observational limit at a finite radius @xmath164 after a  transition \" time @xmath165 estimated from the condition @xmath166 equation  ( 65 ) has two solutions , the trivial value @xmath167 ( which is probably irrelevant since the universe is radiation dominated at the beginning ) , and @xmath168 ( which is also approximately @xmath147 ) . in a sense , @xmath165 is roughly the point at which the universe transitions from being matter - dominated to @xmath138-dominated .",
    "eventually , the universe becomes de sitter and therefore @xmath169 , with @xmath0 settling at the fixed value @xmath170 .",
    "an observer measuring intervals of time at progressively greater distances from his origin of coordinates sees a gravitationally - induced time dilation due to the mass - energy content of the universe between himself and the radius at which he is making the observation .",
    "this gravitational redshift is manifested via the appearance of the radius @xmath0 ( of our cosmic horizon ) in the @xmath171 coefficient of the metric for all the cases we considered in this paper .",
    "its modification to the intervals we measure at radii @xmath172 is a generic feature of any universe with @xmath173 .",
    "however , the actual form of @xmath0 , and its time derivative @xmath158 , depend on the equation of state @xmath174 .",
    "the correspondence between @xmath0 and the event horizon introduced earlier@xcite was discussed at length previously.@xcite briefly , @xmath0 is an instantaneous horizon that ( except in the case @xmath75 ) increases with cosmic time @xmath5 .",
    "it asymptotically approaches rindler s ( fixed ) event horizon in situations where @xmath175 , and is equal to the latter in the case of de sitter , for which @xmath0 is a constant . in cosmologies with @xmath78",
    ", @xmath0 is always greater than the distance traveled by light since the big bang , and therefore does not represent a limit to our range of observations . of course",
    ", in these cases rindler s event horizon also does not exist .    during the radiation- and matter - dominated eras , @xmath163 , and",
    "though measured time intervals @xmath1 are gravitationally dilated relative to the values they would otherwise have , they never diverge . in these cases",
    ", there is therefore no physical limitation to how far we can see except , of course , as restricted by the distance @xmath44 light has traveled since @xmath68 .",
    "but for any universe with an equation of state @xmath76 , we find that @xmath175 , so there exists a _",
    "radius @xmath176 ( where @xmath29 is the current age of the universe ) at which @xmath177 for any finite interval @xmath2 .",
    "thus , although @xmath0 increases with time @xmath5 ( except in the special case @xmath75 ) , our past lightcone is always truncated by gravitational curvature .    in earlier",
    "work,@xcite we explored several observational consequences of this phenomenon .",
    "of particular interest is the peculiar observation that @xmath77 is currently equal ( or nearly equal ) to @xmath71 . as we have seen through the various cosmological spacetimes we considered in this paper",
    ", one would expect the condition @xmath103 to be met only if @xmath40 , in which case it would always be true .",
    "alternatively , it would be met just once , at a time @xmath168 in the context of @xmath138cdm .",
    "for all other times @xmath178 , @xmath0 must be less than @xmath44 .",
    "a more extended discussion of the physical interpretation of these results has appeared elsewhere.@xcite    insofar as the nature of dark energy is concerned , however , the observed equality ( or near equality ) of @xmath77 and @xmath71 presents a problem for models in which @xmath179 . through the various spacetimes we have considered in this paper",
    ", we see that the condition @xmath103 can only be attained for @xmath76 ; otherwise , @xmath0 always exceeds @xmath44 .",
    "but the fact that @xmath0 would then equal @xmath44 just once in the entire history of the universe if @xmath180 constitutes an unacceptably improbable coincidence that we should be seeing this transition occurring right now .",
    "we therefore affirm our earlier conclusion that dark energy is probably not a cosmological constant .",
