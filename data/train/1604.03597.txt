    "<S> [ fig:4_measurement](e ) as a function of the numerical aperture ( na ) of the microlens . </S>",
    "<S> the results show nearly diffraction limited operation of the microlens under strain values up to above 50@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , na decreases and focal spot enlarges as strain is increased . </S>",
    "<S> the measured and simulated focusing efficiencies for different strains are shown in fig . [ fig:4_measurement](f ) . </S>",
    "<S> the focusing efficiency is defined as the ratio of the optical power focused by the device to the incident power ( see supplement 1 for simulation and measurement details ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the measured focusing efficiency of @xmath1375@xmath1 for the relaxed device demonstrates its high optical quality . </S>",
    "<S> the efficiency decreases gradually with increasing the strain ; however , it remains above 50@xmath1 for strain values up to 50@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the simulated focusing efficiency peaks close to the 25@xmath1 strain , for which the device was designed . at small strains , </S>",
    "<S> the measured focusing efficiency agrees well with its simulated value , but the measured efficiency is lower at large strain values . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute the lower measured efficiency to possible mechanical deformations and misalignments of the nano - posts under strain , and the non - uniformity of the strain across the microlens .    </S>",
    "<S> the reliability of the tuning process was tested by measuring the focal spot and focusing efficiency of the tunable metasurface microlens after multiple straining cycles . </S>",
    "<S> no changes in the focusing efficiency and focal spot shape of the microlens was observed after more than 10 cycles of stretching and releasing the device ( see supplement 1 fig . </S>",
    "<S> s4 ) .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we demonstrated highly tunable dielectric metasurfaces based on elastic substrates . </S>",
    "<S> as proof of concept , a spherical - aberration - free microlens with more than 130@xmath1 focal length tunability was demonstrated . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed platform can be applied to other devices based on metasurfaces thus adding tunability over a thin layer without increasing the complexity of the system . </S>",
    "<S> tunable metasurfaces can also be fabricated on high speed electrically tunable elastomers in order to decrease their response time to less than a millisecond @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , integration of this platform with flexible and wearable electronics @xcite can lead to versatile tunable optoelectronic technologies . </S>"
