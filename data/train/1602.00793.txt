    "polynomial lattice rules are qmc rules using a polynomial lattice point set as quadrature points . while we usually resort to some computer search algorithm to find good polynomial lattice rules for @xmath14 ,",
    "the major advantage of polynomial lattice rules lies in their flexibility , that is , we can design a suitable qmc rule for the problem at hand .    in order to achieve a faster convergence of the integration error , explicit constructions of point sets , referred to as _ higher order digital nets",
    "_ , have been established by dick @xcite which can fully exploit the smoothness of an integrand .",
    "specifically qmc rules using higher order digital nets achieve the optimal convergence rate of the integration error of order @xmath15 with arbitrarily small @xmath13 , when the function @xmath11 has square integrable partial mixed derivatives up to order @xmath16 in each variable .",
    "we remark that recent applications in the area of uncertainty quantification , in particular partial differential equations with random coefficients , are in need of using these types of quadrature rules , see for instance @xcite .",
    "the above result by dick is based chiefly on analyzing the decay of the walsh coefficients of smooth functions @xcite .",
    "numerical integration of infinitely many times differentiable functions in certain function spaces has recently been considered in @xcite .",
    "however , the results on higher order digital nets in @xcite do not improve if one assumes that the integrand is infinitely many times differentiable .",
    "more precisely , if one sets @xmath17 in @xcite one obtains constants which are infinite and the error bounds become trivial . to improve the error bounds in these papers for function spaces consisting of infinitely many times differentiable functions using higher order digital nets requires new bounds on the walsh coefficients .",
    "such an analysis of the walsh coefficients was recently done in @xcite , where they obtained a space @xmath18 of infinitely differentiable functions whose walsh coefficients decay with a certain order .",
    "the worst - case error in @xmath18 by a digital net is closely related to the walsh figure of merit ( wafom ) introduced in @xcite , which is one of the computable quality criteria of digital nets , although wafom was originally derived in a different way from @xcite . moreover , suzuki @xcite considered a _ weighted _ space @xmath19 of infinitely differentiable functions and studied tractability of multivariate integration in @xmath19 , where the positive real numbers @xmath20 are the weights .",
    "his result can be summarized as follows : there exists a good qmc rule using a digital net which achieves an _ super - polynomial convergence _ of the worst - case error in @xmath19 as @xmath21 , and moreover , the convergence can be independent of the dimension @xmath0 as @xmath22 for some @xmath23 under a certain condition on the weights @xmath24 .",
    "in this paper , beyond the existence result of @xcite , we provide a constructive approach to finding good qmc rules achieving a dimension - independent super - polynomial convergence of the worst - case error .",
    "specifically we prove that _ interlaced polynomial lattice rules _ can be constructed using a fast component - by - component ( cbc ) algorithm , in at most @xmath2 arithmetic operations , to achieve a dimension - independent super - polynomial convergence . as first studied in @xcite ,",
    "interlaced polynomial lattice rules belong to the family of higher order digital nets and therefore achieve a higher order polynomial convergence of the integration error .",
    "we use them as qmc rules achieving a super - polynomial convergence in this paper . for this purpose , we are required to choose an interlacing factor depending on the number of points and the weights , instead of keeping it fixed ( as for instance in @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , in order to show the worst - case error bound with a super - polynomial convergence , we purposely design a concave function to modify jensen s inequality which has been often used in the literature to obtain error bounds with an improved rate of convergence .",
    "our approach requires to set the weights for constructing a tailored qmc rule , as often encountered in this type of construction algorithms . in practical applications , however , it is not always the case where one can know in advance to which function class the functions of interest belong .",
    "to work around this drawback , it must be interesting to study whether a good convergence property which such a tailored qmc rule holds for a specific function class can be also established for other function classes , as discussed for instance in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark  1 ) .",
    "we observe in section  [ sec : exp ] that our constructed rules empirically work even for some functions not belonging to the target space . in another direction for constructing a robust qmc rule working for many different function classes",
    ", one can implement a more elaborate construction algorithm as given in @xcite . however , theoretical analysis of these issues is beyond the scope of this paper and we leave them open for further research .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we introduce the necessary background and notation , namely walsh functions , a weighted space @xmath19 of infinitely differentiable functions , our considering super - polynomial convergence and interlaced polynomial lattice rules .",
    "we also describe the main results of this paper .",
    "namely , we introduce a component - by - component algorithm , state a result on the convergence behavior of interlaced polynomial lattice rules and discuss the dependence of the worst - case error bound on the dimension . in section  [ sec : error ] , we study the worst - case error in @xmath19 for qmc rules using a digital net and derive a computable upper bound .",
    "we prove in section  [ sec : cbc ] that the cbc algorithm can be used to obtain good interlaced polynomial lattice rules which achieve a dimension - independent super - polynomial convergence of the worst - case error .",
    "thereafter we describe the fast cbc algorithm using the fast fourier transform as in @xcite , and show that interlaced polynomial lattice rules achieving a dimension - independent super - polynomial convergence can be constructed in at most @xmath2 arithmetic operations using @xmath25 memory .",

    "<S> we study multivariate integration over the @xmath0-dimensional unit cube in a weighted space of infinitely differentiable functions . it is known from a recent result by suzuki that there exists a good quasi - monte carlo ( qmc ) rule which achieves a super - polynomial convergence of the worst - case error in this function space , and moreover , that this convergence behavior is independent of the dimension under a certain condition on the weights .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we provide a constructive approach to finding a good qmc rule achieving such a dimension - independent super - polynomial convergence of the worst - case error . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we prove that interlaced polynomial lattice rules , with an interlacing factor chosen properly depending on the number of points @xmath1 and the weights , can be constructed using a fast component - by - component algorithm in at most @xmath2 arithmetic operations to achieve a dimension - independent super - polynomial convergence . </S>",
    "<S> the key idea for the proof of the worst - case error bound is to use a variant of jensen s inequality with a purposely - designed concave function .    </S>",
