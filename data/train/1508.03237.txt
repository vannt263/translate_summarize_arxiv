    "most studies of the faint ( @xmath2  mjy ) radio sky have focused on frequencies around 1.4  ghz , due to the increased telescope time required to survey a field to an equivalent depth at a higher frequency .",
    "this means that while the composition of the lower - frequency radio sky is well constrained ( e.g.  ) , the faint radio sky at higher frequencies is relatively unstudied .",
    "the tenth cambridge ( 10c ; @xcite ) survey at 15.7  ghz has covered @xmath3  deg@xmath4 in ten different fields to a completeness limit of 1  mjy and a further 12  deg@xmath4 to a completeness limit of 0.5  mjy .",
    "the 10c survey therefore provides the ideal starting point from which to study the faint , high - frequency sky .",
    "this survey has recently been extended to even fainter flux densities in two of the 10c fields by whittam et al .",
    "( in prep ) , who calculated the 15  ghz source counts down to 0.1  mjy .    to investigate the nature of the extragalactic radio source population multi - wavelength studies are required , as the power - law nature of radio spectra means that radio data alone is not sufficient to classify source types or estimate redshifts . in the first paper in this series",
    "studying the faint radio source population at 15.7  ghz ( @xcite , hereafter paper  i ) we discuss a sample of sources selected from the lockman hole for which data over a wide range of frequencies are available . the lockman hole is a region of the sky centred near 10@xmath545@xmath6 , + 58@xmath7 ( j2000 coordinates , which are used throughout this work ) with exceptionally low hi column density @xcite .",
    "the low infrared background ( 0.38  mjy  sr@xmath8 at 100  @xmath9 m ; @xcite ) in this area of the sky makes it ideal for deep extragalactic infrared observations . as a result , as part of the _ spitzer _ wide - area infrared extragalactic survey ( swire ; @xcite ) sensitive infrared observations of @xmath10 14 deg@xmath4 of the lockman hole area have been made .",
    "the availability of deep infrared observations in the lockman hole has triggered deep observing campaigns at optical , x - ray and radio wavelengths ( e.g.  ) .",
    "the availability of data at such a wide range of frequencies makes the lockman hole a particularly good area for a multi - wavelength study of the faint radio source population .    in paper",
    "i we selected a sample of 296 sources from the 10c sample in the lockman hole . by matching this catalogue to several lower frequency surveys",
    "we have investigated the radio properties of the sources in this sample ; all but 30 of the 10c sources are matched to sources in one or more of these surveys .",
    "we found a significant increase in the proportion of flat - spectrum sources at flux densities below @xmath101 mjy  the median spectral index between 15.7  ghz and 610  mhz changes from @xmath11 for flux densities greater than 1.5  mjy to @xmath12 for flux densities less than 0.8  mjy ( the convention @xmath13 , for a source with flux density @xmath14 at frequency @xmath15 , is used throughout this work ) .",
    "this suggests that a population of faint , flat - spectrum sources is emerging at flux densities @xmath16 in the high - frequency sky .    in paper",
    "i the spectral index distribution of this sample of sources selected at 15.7  ghz was compared to those of two samples selected at 1.4  ghz from first and nvss .",
    "this showed that there is a significant flat - spectrum population present in the 10c sample which is missing from the samples selected at 1.4  ghz .",
    "the 10c sample was compared to a sample of sources selected from the square kilometre array design studies ( skads ) simulated sky ( s@xmath17 ) by @xcite and we found that this simulation fails to reproduce the observed spectral index distribution and significantly under - predicts the number of sources in the faintest flux density bin .",
    "it is likely that the observed faint , flat - spectrum sources are a result of the cores of fanaroff and riley type i ( fri ; @xcite ) sources becoming dominant at high frequencies .",
    "these results highlight that the faint , high - frequency source population is poorly understood and therefore the importance of further study of this population .    in this paper , we select all sources from the 10c sample studied in paper i which which have deep 1.4-ghz observations available ( from the @xcite , @xcite or @xcite surveys , see section [ section : radio - data ] for full details ) and have flux densities above the 10c completeness limit in the given region",
    ". this complete sample of 96 sources is matched to optical and infrared data available in the field .",
    "these data enable us to distinguish between different source types and estimate photometric redshifts for the objects .",
    "crucially , by using radio - to - optical ratios we are able to separate radio - loud agn , which we know dominate the extragalactic radio source population at higher flux densities ( @xmath18 ) from radio - quiet agn and starforming galaxies , which are predicted to begin to contribute to the source population at lower flux density levels ( e.g.  @xcite ) . the range of multi - wavelength data available in the lockman hole is described in section  [ section : multi - data ] and the methods used to match these catalogues to the 10c catalogue are described in section  [ section : fused - matching ] .",
    "photometric redshifts are calculated in section  [ section : lephare ] and combined with available spectroscopic redshifts to produce a final redshift catalogue . in section  [ section : r ] the radio - to - optical ratio is estimated for all sources in this sample .",
    "the properties of the sample are discussed in light of the redshift information in section  [ section : properties_z ] .",
    "the 10c sample is compared to the s@xmath17 simulation in section  [ section : s3_z ] and to other observational studies in section  [ section : other - studies ] .",
    "the work in paper i is based on a sample of sources selected from the 10c survey at 15.7  ghz .",
    "the 10c survey was observed with the arcminute microkelvin imager ( ami ; @xcite ) which has a resolution of 30  arcsec .",
    "full details of the 10c survey can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this work uses the lockman hole field of the survey , which consists of 4.64  deg@xmath4 complete to 1  mjy and 1.73  deg@xmath4 complete to 0.5  mjy . in paper",
    "i we investigated the radio properties of this sample by matching the catalogue to several lower - frequency catalogues available in the field ; a deep giant meterwave radio telescope ( gmrt ) survey at 610  mhz @xcite , a westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) survey at 1.4  ghz @xcite , two deep very large array ( vla ) surveys at 1.4  ghz by @xcite ( bi2006 ) and @xcite ( om2008 ) , the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) vla sky survey ( nvss ; @xcite ) and faint images of the radio sky at twenty centimetres ( first ; @xcite ) .",
    "these radio data are summarised in table [ tab : radio - data ] .",
    "lower - frequency counterparts were found for 266 out of the 296 sources in the sample , allowing radio spectral indices to be calculated for these 266 sources and upper limits to be placed on the spectral indices of the remaining 30 sources .",

    "the majority of the @xcite wsrt map has an rms noise of @xmath19jy / beam and parts have an rms noise of 11 @xmath9jy / beam .",
    "this means that it should be possible to detect the faintest sources in the complete 10c sample ( with @xmath20mjy ) in the wsrt map provided they have spectral indices @xmath21 ( where @xmath13 ) , assuming a 3@xmath22 wsrt detection .",

    "the flux density distributions of the full sample and sub - sample used in this paper are also very similar , although none of the faintest sources in the full sample appear in the sample studied here , as this sample only contains sources above the 10c completeness limits ( 0.5 and 1  mjy in the deep and shallow regions respectively ) .",
