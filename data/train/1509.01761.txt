    "at the end of the 1960s there were performed at the stanford linear accelerator center ( slac ) a series of experiments in which electrons with energy above 21 giga electron - volts ( gev ) were directed towards ",
    "proton - targets \" and as a result of this scattering were produced a variety of hadronic final states .",
    "this type of scattering is known as deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) .",
    "this scattering has immense importance in high energy physics , because was through it that was revealed the internal structure of protons .",
    "this scattering is called deep because it occurs in high energy and it is inelastic because the resulting particles are different from the initial state .",
    "the figure @xmath1 shows a pictorial representation of a deep inelastic scattering between a lepton @xmath2 , exchanging a virtual photon of momentum @xmath3 and one target hadron with momentum @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath5 represents the various other hadrons that can be produced from the collision .",
    "[ dis ]    the important parameters for the dis are the virtuality of the photon , given by @xmath6 , with metric signature @xmath7 , and the bjorken variable @xmath0 , defined by @xmath8    some other parameters are also relevant , such as the mass @xmath9 of the initial hadron , such that @xmath10 , and the squared center - of - mass energy , @xmath11 .",
    "the condition @xmath12 defines the range of bjorken variable @xmath0 , such that @xmath13 . strictly speaking , both for the dis , and for other processes",
    ", the incoming electron corresponds to the @xmath14 limit with @xmath0 fixed . in the dis case",
    "the bjorken variable itself defines the inelasticity of scattering .",
    "the differential cross section for dis can be written as @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the fine structure constant , @xmath17 is the leptonic tensor and @xmath18 is known as the hadronic tensor and is the quantity of interest here .",
    "assuming that the initial hadron state is not polarized , the hadronic tensor has the following form @xcite : @xmath19|p , { \\cal q } \\rangle\\ ] ]    where @xmath20q@xmath21 represents a normalizable hadronic state with 4-momentum @xmath22 and electric charge @xmath23 of the initial hadron and @xmath24 is the electromagnetic hadronic current .    using the gauge invariance , @xmath25 , and lorentz covariance the tensor in ( [ f3 ] ) can be decomposed as follows : @xmath26    where @xmath27 e @xmath28 are called the structure functions .",
    "these functions describe the distribution of momenta of the quarks inside the protons .    for the particular regime",
    "where @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( gev)@xmath31 there is an approximate relation between these functions known as the callan - gross relation @xmath32    using the optical theorem one can relate the tensor @xmath33 through the imaginary part of the forward compton scattering , describe by the tensor : @xmath34    where @xmath35 means that the operators product is temporally ordered .",

    "one can relate those structure functions , using the optical theorem , so :    @xmath39    the description of strong interactions via quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is consensus across the scientific community , even at low energy limit @xmath40 where the qcd can not be treated perturbatively .    an innovative proposal to overcome",
    "this difficulty is the anti - de sitter correspondence / conformal field theory ( ads / cft ) @xcite .",
    "this conjecture or duality relates a conformal @xmath41 super yang - mills theory ( sym ) with symmetry group @xmath42 , with @xmath43 , living in @xmath44 dimensional flat spacetime ( minkowski ) with a superstring theory in a 10-dimensional curved spacetime known as anti de sitter space which can be mathematically described as @xmath45 . from general arguments of the ads / cft conjecture",
    "one can see that there is an isomorphism between the hilbert spaces of the bulk and boundary theories .",
    "the sym theory at the boundary has a continuous spectrum of particles , which is a consequence of its conformal symmetry . due to this symmetry ,",
    "the ads / cft correspondence can not be used directly in the study of hadrons because in general one can not define an s matrix for this problem .",
    "polchinski and strassler @xcite studied glueball scattering in four dimensions using the ads / cft correspondence and proposed that this scattering would correspond to a finite region of the @xmath46 space , thus the conformal invariance should be broken . in the works",
    "@xcite a cut off at a certain value @xmath47 of the radial @xmath48 coordinate of @xmath49 space was introduced and and it was considered a slice of ads space in the region @xmath50 with a boundary condition at @xmath51 .",
    "moreover one can associate the size of ads slice with the energy scale of the qcd : @xmath52    this model is known as the hardwall and although it has an abrupt infrared cut off it proved quite promising and some interesting results were found @xcite . for the dis , within the hardwall context",
    ", some important results have been achieved @xcite .    the softwall model ( sw ) arises with the aim to make the breaking of the conformal invariance with a softer infrared cut off .",
    "this model is quite interesting because it provides linear regge trajectories for mesons and glueballs @xcite .",
    "these phenomenological models are known generically as ads / qcd models .    in this present work",
    "the structure functions will be calculated for the dis using the formulation of ads / qcd in the softwall model .",
    "other studies for dis have been discussed within the softwall model finding results consistent with the literature @xcite and for other dis studies using holographic models see for instance @xcite .    in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite the sw model was used to discuss the dis problem in the large and small bjorken parameters . here , in this work , we extend this discussion to the exponentially small bjorken parameter .",
    "this is important because the exponentially small @xmath0 regime is relevant to the discussion of saturation in qcd wich we will address here in the section v. this problem was discussed within the hardwall model in @xcite . since the hardwall and softwall models have different spectra , in particular leading to different regge trajectories , we want to study the saturation line in the softwall model to see if it leads to any different behavior .",
    "this work is organized as follows : in section ii , we review the main properties of the softwall model and its description of the dis process . in section iii ,",
    "we discuss the exponentially small @xmath0 regime within the softwall model and calculate the corresponding structure functions . in the section iv , in order to emphasize our results found in section iii , we compare then with the ones found in the literature . in section v , we use the results of the previous section to study the saturation line in strong interactions as implied by the softwall model .",
    "finally , in section vi , we present our conclusions .",
    "the holographic sw model was proposed originally for the study of vector mesons @xcite and subsequently extended to glueballs @xcite .",
    "the sw model introduces a decreasing exponential factor in the action for the fields by phenomenological motivation and to obtain a linear regge trajectory .",
    "it is a natural extension of the hardwall model , that is , is an alternative way to break the conformal invariance in the boundary theory and , therefore , make it an approximate effective theory for qcd . in this model ,",
    "the action for the fields found in the @xmath53 space will be @xcite : @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the lagrangean density , @xmath56 is a scalar dilaton field , @xmath57 is the determinant of the metric @xmath58 of the @xmath53 space , given by : @xmath59    @xmath48 is the holographic coordinate , @xmath60 is the angular measure on @xmath61 , @xmath62 is the @xmath46 space radius given by @xmath63 , with @xmath64 ( regge slope ) . in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that if the dilaton is written as : @xmath65    then , one obtains linear regge trajectories .",
    "this new approach does not change the geometry of @xmath46 space , that is , @xmath66 .",
    "however , it can be seen that the @xmath67 factor inserted in the action makes the integrand becomes increasingly closer to zero as the value of @xmath48 increases , unlike the abrupt behavior of the hardwall model .",
    "the constant @xmath68 has dimension of mass squared and is associated with the qcd scale .    in this work",
    "we use indices @xmath69 to refer to the @xmath70dimensional space , separating into @xmath71 for the minkowski spacetime at the boundary of @xmath46 , @xmath72 on @xmath46 and @xmath73 on @xmath61 .",

    "the study made in this present work aimed to investigate if the introduction of a dilatonic scalar field in the the gauge fields , which is a softwall approach requirement , produces some modification in the phase diagram found in @xcite . by the arguments used in section v , the softwall gauge fields can be perfectly used for this study and we found a similar form of the structure functions @xmath350 .    we have also seen in section iv that the dis formulations of hardwall and softwall are equivalent up to exponentially small terms thus supporting the results found in @xcite and @xcite . in particular , this can be seen explicitly in eqs .",
