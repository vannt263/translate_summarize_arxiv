    "understanding strong qcd aspects of hadron properties remains a challenge .",
    "experimental probes at large momentum transfer will continue to yield a wealth of data on hadron structure  stimulating theoretical explanations of the underlying physics in terms of quark and gluon degrees of freedom .",
    "it is well known that light - cone correlation functions are relevant for describing hard processes @xcite , since struck constituents rebound at speeds near that of light . in recent years",
    "there has been renewed interest in the connection between inclusive and exclusive reactions at large momentum transfer @xcite . the underlying connection is encompassed by generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) which are functions that enter in the description of a variety hard exclusive processes @xcite .",
    "attempting to describe the non - perturbative light - cone correlations that enter in large momentum transfer processes has led to the formulation of gauge theories on the light cone @xcite .",
    "there has been progress in directly solving for pion light - cone fock components in light - cone hamiltonian qcd @xcite .",
    "another important stride has been made in enumerating and classifying hadronic light - cone fock - space amplitudes @xcite .",
    "these could be used for modeling hadrons , although lorentz covariance requires infinitely many fock components and the incorporation of symmetries into model wave functions has been very limited .    in a different approach ,",
    "qcd models based on solutions to dyson - schwinger equations provide a useful framework for exploring strongly interacting bound states , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "this framework is fully poincar covariant , allows for close contact with lattice simulations and provides a means to preserve symmetries and implement quark and gluon confinement .",
    "dyson - schwinger models have also been used to study light - cone dominated amplitudes .",
    "calculation of quark distributions in the impulse approximation was undertaken in @xcite , where the nucleon bethe - salpeter equation was solved in a diquark spectator model .",
    "that investigation relied upon the use of free particle propagators for the quarks and diquark . in a different study , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite calculated quark distribution functions for the pion using a dyson - schwinger type model based on entire functions .",
    "their analysis avoided two problems : the integral over the relative light - cone energy is not convergent in the complex plane because non - constant entire functions are unbounded ; secondly , expressions were derived supposing the existence of a klln - lehmann representation which admittedly does not exist for their model propagator .",
    "although such a model is successful at describing low momentum , space - like processes where the propagator can be approximated as entire , the non - analytic points in the whole complex plane must be known to calculate the quark distribution .",
    "the present investigation enlarges the class of model propagators which can be used to calculate light - cone dominated amplitudes .",
    "we show how meromorphic propagators can be used in minkowski space to arrive at parton and generalized parton distributions as well as the electromagnetic form factor expressed on the light cone .",

    "recent work @xcite in solving the bethe - salpeter equation with a quark propagator consisting of pairs of complex conjugate singularities shows that the width for meson decay ( into free quarks ) generated from one pole is exactly canceled by the contribution from its complex conjugate .",

    "first in section [ minkowski ] , we present the scalar model used to investigate complex conjugate poles in propagators . here",
    "we show that naive calculation of the quark distribution in minkowski space is problematic .",
    "the distribution has neither proper support nor is positive definite . in section [ euclidean ]",
    "we demonstrate that despite troubles in minkowski space , amplitudes involving propagators with pairs of complex conjugate poles can be calculated directly in euclidean space . the double distribution ( dd )",
    "is extracted from non - diagonal matrix elements of twist - two operators .",
    "this distribution satisfies all of the relevant spectral and support properties and can be used to derive parton and generalized parton distributions for the model , in addition to the electromagnetic form factor . in section [ cutting ] , we show that the quark distribution can be calculated in minkowski space by using a natural modification of the cutting rules applied to the handbag diagram .",
    "the effect of these cutting rules is to put intermediate states on their complex mass shells .",
    "finally in section [ analytic ] , we rectify the situation in minkowski space by analytically continuing amplitudes from euclidean space .",
    "this justifies the cutting rules presented .",
    "the detailed calculation of the generalized parton distribution in minkowski space is contained in the appendix .",
    "after analytic continuation , the model s parton and generalized parton distributions agree with those calculated from the euclidean space dd .",
    "a brief summary ( section [ summy ] ) concludes the paper .",
    "in this section we present the simple model under consideration . here",
    "the propagator is treated in minkowski space where difficulties are encountered .",
    "we show that amplitudes can not be directly calculated in minkowski space when complex conjugate poles are present in propagators and vertices .",
    "the model we take is @xmath0 theory with electromagnetic interactions .",
    "equivalently we can view this model as a bound state of two scalar particles with a trivial bethe - salpeter vertex @xmath1 , where the coupling constant is assumed to be absorbed into the overall normalization .",
    "we make a simple _ ansatz _ for the non - perturbative propagator consisting of a pair of complex conjugate poles @xmath2 where @xmath3 . defining for ease @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( which is taken to be positive without any loss of generality ) ,",
    "we can write the propagator as @xmath6 the light - cone energy poles , we define the light - cone variables @xmath7 .",
    "] of the propagator are thus @xmath8 and @xmath9 , where @xmath10 denotes the complex conjugate .",
    "although we use a scalar model , results straightforwardly extend to spin-@xmath11 particles , e.g. , since only the pole structure of eq .",
    "is relevant .",

    "moreover , the distribution is not real valued , whereas it should be positive definite .",
    "thus the model based on the propagator in eq .   can not be suitably formulated in minkowski space .",
    "we will find below that eq .",
    "makes sense as a minkowski space propagator only after analytic continuation from euclidean space for the amplitude in question .",
    "in euclidean space , the model propagator is @xmath20 here and below we use the shorthand @xmath21 to denote the pair of poles @xmath22 . unlike in minkowski space where the measure is imaginary ,",
    "contributions to euclidean space amplitudes are real and one has no difficulty in calculating form factors and distribution functions using @xmath23 in the relevant diagrams .",
    "the simplicity of the model at hand will allow us to calculate its double distribution analytically and thereby determine the quark distribution and electromagnetic form factor , since these functions are related to the double distribution by the so - called reduction relations .",
    "the remainder of the paper will be devoted to calculation of these quantities in minkowski space by projecting onto the light - cone .",
    "gpds are not lorentz invariant objects , however , they stem from a projection of a lorentz invariant double distribution function @xcite .",
    "these functions are particularly attractive from the perspective of model building @xcite , though one must be careful that the starting point is indeed covariant @xcite , otherwise desirable distribution properties and straightforward physical interpretation may be sacrificed .",

    "this will force us to deal with the underlying wick rotation necessary to define the model in minkowski space .    in section [ euclidean ] , the model double distributions were calculated in euclidean space . thus to calculate related amplitudes in minkowski space , we must wick rotate in the complex energy plane : @xmath103 .",

    "the space - like amplitude for the generalized parton distribution can now be continued to minkowski space and hence be evaluated by projecting onto the light cone .",
    "to do so , we refer to figure [ ftwist ] and insert the non - local light - cone operator @xmath116 in place of the local twist - two operators denoted by a cross in the figure . here",
    "the plus - component picks out the leading - twist contribution according to light - cone power counting .",

    "is concerned , resulting expressions would be truly poincar covariant ( as opposed to diagonal with respect to the non - interacting operators ) and would satisfy field - theoretic identities . filling these two gaps",
    "is essential for adequate hadronic phenomenology for processes at large momentum transfer .",

    "the @xmath150 and @xmath139 poles have non - zero real parts ; so @xmath147 has been set to zero for these poles above .    using the expressions for the new poles eq .",
    "and the bound state stability condition eq .",
    ", we can determine the quadrant location of the singularities independent of @xmath136 and @xmath140 ( see footnote @xmath82 ) .",
    "these quadrant locations are depicted for the full range of @xmath53 in figure [ fpoles ] . accordingly",
    "poles in the first and third quadrants are wick poles . as we saw in section [ analytic ]",
    ", the net result of the analytic continuation is to evaluate the integral by effectively closing the contour in the right- or left - half plane . hence the gpd eq .",
    "is @xmath151   + 2 \\pi i \\ ; \\theta(x - \\zeta ) \\theta(1 - x ) \\big [ \\operatorname{\\text{res}}(\\tilde{k}^-_b ) + \\operatorname{\\text{res}}(\\tilde{k}^-_{b^ * } ) \\big].\\ ] ] evaluating the residues in eq .",
    "yields the result of section [ analytic ] , namely eq .   which is algebraically equivalent to eq .",
    "notice from figure [ fpoles ] , other @xmath147 prescriptions for the shift , such as @xmath152 , lead to an incorrect result for the case when there are no complex conjugate pairs .",
    "the figure shows that the infinitesimal prescription must be positive and independent of the sign of @xmath53 , @xmath153 , _ etc _ , in order to reproduce the familiar result .",
    "it is interesting to note that for @xmath154 in the case without conjugate pairs , all poles of the integrand are wick poles .",
    "though since the integral is convergent , the sum of these wick residues vanishes .",
