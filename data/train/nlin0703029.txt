    "the study of nonlinear localized excitations in lattices of oscillators , which receive the name of intrinsic localized modes or discrete breathers @xcite , is an active research field in nonlinear physics .",
    "these vibrational modes are rather generic in models of klein - gordon and fpu lattices  @xcite .",
    "they also appear as solutions of the discrete nonlinear shrdinger ( dnls ) equation @xcite where these excitations are usually known as discrete solitons .    under certain conditions ,",
    "stationary breathers can be made mobile @xcite , i.e. , when they experience appropriate perturbations , the breathers travel through the chain and they are called moving breathers ( mbs ) .",
    "there are no exact solutions for mbs , but they can be obtained by means of numerical calculations .",
    "the conditions for the existence of mbs in klein - gordon lattices are strongly dependent on the exact details of both the on - site and the interaction potentials .",

    "the study of collisions of mbs has been initiated in fpu chains @xcite .",
    "however , in klein - gordon chains , the studies have been limited to the interaction of moving low - amplitude breathers with stationary high - amplitude ones @xcite , or to the interaction between quasi - periodic moving breathers in dissipative lattices  @xcite .",
    "the study of soliton collisions in non - integrable dnls models has not been undertaken until very recently .",
    "these models deal with nearly integrable dnls equations  @xcite , cubic dnls equations  @xcite and saturable dnls equations  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to get some insight into the detailed mechanisms and possible outcomes of collisions in a klein - gordon chain of oscillators with morse on - site potential .",
    "we have considered only two types of collisions : a )  symmetric collisions , that is , collisions of two identical mbs traveling with opposite velocities ; b )  non - symmetric collisions , or head - on collisions of two mbs with the same frequency but different velocities .",

    "a moving breather @xmath9 can be obtained with the following initial displacements and velocities :    @xmath10    the plus - sign corresponds to a breather moving towards the positive direction and the minus one , the opposite .",
    "this procedure taken from the dnls context @xcite works as well as the marginal - mode method @xcite and gives good mobility for a large range of @xmath2 .",
    "the parameter @xmath11 is the difference of phase between two neighboring oscillators an we will refer to it as the _ wave number_. the translational velocity and the translational kinetic energy of the mb increase with @xmath11 .",
    "we use eqs .",
    "( [ ic ] ) as initial conditions to integrate the dynamical equations using a symplectic algorithm @xcite .",
    "the number of oscillators @xmath12 is between 100 and 200 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the study begins generating two mbs with the same frequency , located initially far apart , traveling in opposite directions .",
    "we have considered two different types of collisions , symmetric and non - symmetric collisions . for symmetric collisions ,",
    "both mbs have initially the same displacements and opposite velocities given by eqs .",
    "( [ ic ] ) with the same wave number @xmath11 .",
    "there are two types of symmetric collisions : a ) on - site collisions ( os ) , if initially the centers of the breathers are separated by an odd number of particles , and b ) inter - site collisions ( is ) , if that number is even @xcite .",
    "in this section , we present the results of the numerical simulations for symmetric and non - symmetric collisions .",
    "the breather frequency @xmath13 is below the phonon band because the on - site potential is soft .",
    "the lowest frequency of the phonon band is equal to the linear frequency of each isolated oscillator and is given by @xmath14 . for breathers with small amplitude",
    "the system is close to the linear limit , and their frequency is close to @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , @xmath16 is a measure of how far the system is from the linear regime .",
    "hence , it is natural to think that the collision scenario should be strongly dependent of the common frequency of the two mbs .",
    "for that reason , we have considered two different breather frequencies , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , that represent different degrees of nonlinearity .",
    "we describe below the different scenarios that appear considering the two types of collisions and the two frequencies .    before considering collisions between mbs ,",
    "it is necessary to have an estimate of their lifetime .",
    "a mb has not a single frequency but a continuous band around the frequency of the stationary breather .",
    "as this band contains phonon frequencies , phonons are excited and the breather loses energy .",

    "[ fig1 ]      we have performed an extensive study of collisions considering different values of the coupling parameter @xmath2 and mbs with different values of the wave number @xmath11 .",

    "the results can be summarized as follows :    1 .   _ breather generation with trapping _ : + the collision produces three new breathers , a trapped one located at the collision region , and two new symmetric mbs , as fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) shows for @xmath20 .",
    "the trapped breather contains most of the initial energy .",
    "this behavior has been described in the pioneering work cited in ref.@xcite .",

    "[ fig2](b ) corresponds to @xmath21 . in this case",
    "the emerging mbs contain most of the initial energy .",
    "2 .   _ breather reflection _ : + with a slightly different value of @xmath11 , it is possible a collision which results in two new symmetric mbs , with almost the same velocity that the colliding breathers. this is shown in fig .",

    "the total energy transported by the colliding mbs is distributed after the collision : some part corresponds to the energy of the trapped breather , another part to the emerging mbs , and a small fraction of the energy is transferred to the lattice in the form of phonon radiation . in order to illustrate this phenomenon ,",
    "we have studied the evolution of the `` central energy '' , defined in our study as the energy of eleven particles around the collision region .",
    "this number of particles has been selected because it corresponds to the typical size of a discrete breather with the parameters used .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the evolution of the central energy for the three cases considered in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .    before the collision the central energy is zero ; after the initiation of the collision it increases quickly , up to a value very close to the sum of the incident mbs energies ; the subsequent decrease of the central energy is caused by the appearance of two emerging mbs and by phonon radiation .",

    "the emerging mbs have higher frequency ( @xmath24 ) and smaller amplitude than the colliding breathers. we have also obtained the fourier spectra for the breathers shown in fig .

    "note that almost all points are distributed inside a band apparently at random .",
    "this means that a small change of @xmath11 can affects the energy of the trapped breather .",
    "occasionally , for large enough values of @xmath11 , there are points outside the band which correspond to a relative trapped energy close to zero , i.e. , for those values of @xmath11 , the breathers are reflected .",
    "the behavior of the relative trapped energy around one of these points can be better appreciated if we choose a smaller step size for @xmath11 .",
    "for example , if we take @xmath11 within the interval [ 0.1360,0.1400 ] with step size 0.0002 , we find that for @xmath29 there is trapping , and for @xmath30 the breathers are reflected .",
