    ", it can be said that they are un - recycled pulsars whose companions are still in the main sequence in binary systems . or they are on the way of evolution , where the first born pulsars are experiencing the spin - down with no accretion .",

    "the heavier progenitor star explodes first to form a neutron star , and then the lighter one evolves until to its supernova explosion . during the evolution of the second star , the first formed neutron star will accrete matter , leading to its recycling .",
    "the short characteristic age of j1906 + 0746 ( @xmath16=113000yr ) indicates that it is a recently formed young pulsar after the core collapse , which is the reason why its b - p position lies above the spin - up line .",
    "b1820 - 11 ( no .  6 in fig .",

    ", we suggest that it is a young recycled pulsar .",
    "if we reconsider its radius as 15 km or 20 km instead of 10 km in the spin - up line equation , then its magnetic field is about @xmath20 g and @xmath21 g , respectively .",
    "therefore , in fig .  1 , the position of b1820 - 11 with the new magnetic field value will lie below the spin - up line .",
    "the evolution history of this pulsar can be understood in this way : the initial magnetic field of neutron star can be as high as @xmath22 g , and it can evolve from the position of long spin period to that of short spin period after the neutron star accretes about @xmath23 , while one to two magnitude orders of magnetic field has been deducted .",

    "it can be derived that this pulsar acquired the accretion mass easily and followed up the recycled process .",
    "there is about @xmath28 accretion mass added to this pulsar that can lead to its magnetic field deduce two magnitude orders from its initial values . following the similar procedure of binary pulsar b1820 - 11 ( no .",
    "6 ) , by setting the neutron star radius as large as r=20 km , the magnetic field of j1141 - 6545 will be about @xmath29 g , which makes this source just below the spin - up line as a new born recycled pulsar .",
    "therefore , the evolution picture of this pulsar can be depicted like this : the progenitor of j1141 - 6545 may be a star with the strong magnetic field @xmath30 g , and its field decays two magnitude orders with the accreting mass of about @xmath31 .",
    "in a binary system , with enough accreting matter from the companions , a pulsar should be below the spin - up line . with the distribution of 186 binary pulsars in b - p diagram",

    "the other three binary pulsars with recycled companions have not experienced the recycled processes : one system is a double neutron system . the observed pulsar is a young one with a recycled neutron star .",
    "the other two systems include degenerate stars ( ns+wd ) , where the pulsars can be understood as newly formed recycling pulsars at the eddington rate ; and their b - p positions can be shifted to just below the spin - up line by assuming a different neutron star radius , e.g.  @xmath33 km .     + this work is supported by national basic research program of china ( 973 program 2009cb824800 ) , china ministry of science and technology under state key development program for basic research ( 2012cb821800 ) , nsfc10773017 , nsfc11173034 , and knowledge innovation program of cas kjcx2- yw - t09 ."
