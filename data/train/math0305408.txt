    "modelling the flow of complex fluids is a very intricate problem which is far from being solved up to now . besides studies which aim at improving phenomenological rheological models ( purely macroscopic constitutive laws )",
    ", only a few attempts are made to recover the rheological behavior of a complex fluid from elementary physical processes arising in its microstructure . +    the mesoscopic model which has been proposed by hbraud and lequeux in @xcite deals with simple shear flows of concentrated suspensions .",
    "it is obtained by dividing the material in a large number of mesoscopic elements ( `` blocks '' ) with a given shear stress @xmath0 ( @xmath0 is a real number ; it is in fact an extra - diagonal term of the stress tensor in convenient coordinates ) and by considering the evolution of the probability density @xmath1 which represents the distribution of stress in the assembly of blocks . under various assumptions on the evolution of the stresses of the blocks which will be described below",
    ", the equation for the probability density @xmath1 for a block to be under stress @xmath0 at time @xmath2 may be written as :    [ eq : syst - p ]    _ tp =- b(t ) _",
    "p+d(p(t ) ) ^2_p - p+_0 ( ) ( 0;t);[eq : p ] + p0 ; + p(0,)=p_0 ( ) , [ eq : p0er ]    where for @xmath3 , we denote by @xmath4 in equation  ( [ eq : p ] ) , @xmath5}$ ] denotes the characteristic function of the open set @xmath6 $ ] and @xmath7 the dirac delta function on @xmath8 .",
    "each term arising in the above equation ( hl equation in short ) has a clear physical interpretation .",
    "when a block is sheared , the stress of this block evolves with a variation rate @xmath9 proportional to the shear rate @xmath10 ( @xmath11 is an elasticity constant ) ; in this study , the shear rate @xmath10 , and therefore the function @xmath12 , are assumed to be in @xmath13 .",
    "when the modulus of the stress overcomes a critical value @xmath14 , the block becomes unstable and may relax into a state with zero stress after a characteristic relaxation time @xmath15 .",
    "this phenomenon induces a rearrangement of the blocks and is modelled through the diffusion term @xmath16 .",
    "the diffusion coefficient @xmath17 is assumed to be proportional to the amount of stress which has to be redistributed by time unit and the positive parameter @xmath18 is supposed to represent the  mechanical fragility \" of the material .    in all that follows ,",
    "the parameters @xmath18 , @xmath15 and @xmath14 are positive , and the initial data @xmath19 in is a given probability density ; that is @xmath20 we will be looking for solutions @xmath21 in @xmath22 such that @xmath23 belongs to @xmath24 to the nonlinear parabolic partial differential equation  .",
    "the subscript @xmath0 refers to integration over @xmath8 with respect to @xmath0 , whereas the subscript @xmath2 refers to time integration on @xmath25 $ ] for any @xmath26 .",
    "note that the average stress in the material is given by @xmath27 and therefore the above condition on @xmath28 ensures that the average stress is an essentially bounded function of time .",
    "+    actually in practice , the shear rate is not uniform in the flow and in order to better describe the coupling between the macroscopic flow and the evolution of the microstructure we introduce and study in a second paper  @xcite a micro - macro model . in this model @xmath29 is also a function of the macroscopic space variables and the average stress defined by   is inserted into the macroscopic equation governing the velocity of the macroscopic flow .    in order to lighten the notation and without loss of generality we assume from now on that @xmath30 and @xmath31",
    "this amounts to changing the time and stress scales .",
    "the main difficulties one encounters in the mathematical analysis come from the nonlinearity in the diffusion term and also and even more from the fact that the parabolic equation may degenerate when the viscosity coefficient @xmath32 vanishes , and this will be shown to may appear only when @xmath33 .",
    "this difficulty is illustrated on a simplified example just below and also in section  [ sec : stat ] where we discuss the existence of stationary solutions in the case when the shear rate @xmath34 is a constant .",
    "let us first of all look at the following simplified model which already includes the difficulties we are going to face to in the study of equation  .",
    "we consider the equation  : @xmath35 - 1,1[}(\\sigma)\\ ; , \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath36 - 1,1[}$ ] is the characteristic function of the interval @xmath37 - 1,1[$ ] .",
    "the initial condition is on purpose chosen in such a way that @xmath38 . the function @xmath39 - 1,1[}(\\sigma)$ ] is a stationary solution to this equation and for this solution @xmath40 is identically zero .",
    "but it is not the unique solution to   in @xmath41 .",
    "it is indeed possible to construct a so - called _ vanishing viscosity solution _ for which @xmath42 for all @xmath43 , and there are actually infinitely many solutions to this equation .",
    "( this statement is obtained as a corollary of lemma  [ lem:2 ] in section  [ sec : deg ] below . )    as far as equation ( [ eq : syst - p ] ) is concerned , we show that , in the case when @xmath33 and @xmath44 , we may have either a unique or infinitely many solutions , depending on the initial data ( see proposition  [ prop : deg ] in section  [ sec : deg ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , we are able to prove the following existence and uniqueness result in the non - degenerate case when @xmath45  :    [ th : main1 ] let the initial data @xmath19 satisfy the conditions @xmath46 and assume that @xmath47 then , for every @xmath48 , there exists a unique solution @xmath29 to the system   in @xmath49 .",
    "moreover , @xmath50 , @xmath51 for all @xmath52 , @xmath53 and for every @xmath48 there exists a positive constant @xmath54 such that @xmath55 besides @xmath56 so that the average stress @xmath57 is well - defined by ( [ eq : def - tau ] ) in @xmath58 .",
    "the first step toward the existence proof of solutions to   will consist in the study of so - called vanishing viscosity approximations , which are the unique solutions to the family of equations    [ syst : p - eps ]    _ tp_=-b(t)_p_+(d(p_(t))+)^2_p _ -_p_+ _ 0 ( ) ; [ eq : p - eps ] + p_0 ; + p_(0,)=p_0    ( recall that we have rescaled the time and stress units to get @xmath31 and @xmath30 ) .",
    "section [ sec : visc ] below is devoted to the proof of the following    [ prop : visc ] let @xmath48 be given .",
    "we assume that the initial data satisfies the same conditions as in the statement of the theorem .",
    "then , for every @xmath48 and @xmath59 , there exists a unique solution @xmath60 to in @xmath61 .",

    "lastly , the description of stationary solutions in the constant shear rate case is carried out in section  [ sec : stat ] .",
