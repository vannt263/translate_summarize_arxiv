    "the elements of @xmath7 commute with each other , as do the elements of @xmath8 .",
    "the commutation relations of @xmath0 with @xmath6 are given by the usual action of matrices on vectors and covectors , while commutators of @xmath7 with @xmath8 produce elements of @xmath0 . to pass to the deformation @xmath2 , one needs to change only the last relation : commutators of @xmath7 and @xmath8 will now be not just elements of @xmath0 but rather some polynomial @xmath9 of them , where @xmath10 are the deformation parameters mentioned above and @xmath11 are basis polynomials introduced in @xcite .",
    "this deformation turns out to be very interesting , since it unifies the representation theory of @xmath1 with that of degenerate affine hecke algebras ( @xcite,@xcite ) and of symplectic reflection algebras ( @xcite ) .",

    "since @xmath109 acts by constants on both @xmath76 and @xmath127 , which can be considered as a submodule of @xmath76 , we get @xmath128 .",

    "let @xmath700 be a closed subscheme of @xmath701 defined by @xmath702 , and let @xmath703 where jac is the jacobi matrix of @xmath699 at @xmath704 with respect to some basis of @xmath7 and @xmath593 .",
    "it suffices to show that @xmath705 is a codimension 2 subvariety of @xmath706 and that the latter is irreducible .",
    "now , recall that @xmath707 by changing basis , we can rewrite @xmath708 as @xmath709 , where @xmath710 and @xmath711 are polynomial expressions in @xmath712 and @xmath713 ( in particular , there is no dependence on @xmath249 ) .",
    "we can and will use the jacobian of @xmath714 instead of @xmath715 to describe @xmath705 .",
    "let us calculate the derivatives of @xmath716 with respect to @xmath717 and @xmath718 : @xmath719 thus , if @xmath720 for some @xmath721 , then @xmath722 for all @xmath723 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath724 .",
    "now we will consider the situation in @xmath725 .",
    "we know that @xmath726 , where @xmath727 and @xmath728 is the nilpotent cone of @xmath593 .",
    "since @xmath7 and @xmath728 are irreducible , @xmath729 , and hence @xmath706 , is irreducible .",
    "recall that @xmath705 was defined as the locus of points @xmath730 such that @xmath731 , or in other words , all @xmath732 minors of the jacobian matrix have determinant 0 .",
    "since each of those determinants is homogeneous with respect to our second filtration , it is natural to define @xmath733 as a locus of points where @xmath731 .",
    "then , @xmath734 .",
    "note that @xmath735 , where @xmath736 and @xmath737 .",
    "the codimension of a regular nilpotent s orbit is 2 , so @xmath738 .",
    "it suffices to show that @xmath739 as well .",
    "we shall do this by showing that given a regular nilpotent @xmath142 , @xmath740 , where @xmath741 .",
    "let us switch to a basis of @xmath593 where the skew symmetric form is represented by the matrix @xmath742 if we define @xmath743 then @xmath744 , implying @xmath602 .",
    "now , suppose that @xmath745 at @xmath746 , for @xmath747 . by examining the @xmath748 components of @xmath749 ,",
    "we get @xmath750 ; moreover , either @xmath751 , or @xmath752 . the conditions @xmath753 define a codimension two subspace as desired .",
    "we thus need to show that if @xmath750 and @xmath752 , then @xmath745 implies a nontrivial condition on @xmath249 .",
    "to find such a condition , note that @xmath754 and that @xmath755 does not depend on @xmath249 .",
    "now , let us take @xmath756 ; we can verify that @xmath757 , so @xmath758 .",
    "we note that @xmath759 , @xmath760 , @xmath761 and so forth .",
    "thus , @xmath762 .",
    "however , setting @xmath763 , we get @xmath764 , which is a nontrivial degree two polynomial in @xmath765 that should equal the number @xmath766 .",
    "this gives the other codimension 1 condition , and so @xmath767 is at least of codimension 2 in @xmath729 as desired .",
    "in this section , we will outline the proof of lemma [ lemma : sp2nkey ] , which states : @xmath768 we use the basis for @xmath7 defined in section [ section : sp2n ] , in which @xmath594 is represented by the matrix @xmath675 .",
    "let us multiply ( [ eqn : identity ] ) by @xmath637 and sum over @xmath340 to get the equivalent assertion that @xmath769 since the whole sum is @xmath649-invariant ( even though each term considered separately is not ) , we can look at the restriction of the sum to @xmath58 .",
    "thus , this sum equals zero if and only if @xmath770    we choose the following basis @xmath648 for @xmath593 : @xmath771 , @xmath772 , @xmath773 , for all @xmath774 , and for all @xmath775 , the elements @xmath776 , @xmath777 , @xmath778 , and @xmath779 .",
    "we observe that for any @xmath780 , there exists a unique basis vector in @xmath648 that takes @xmath781 to @xmath782 ; we shall denote this element by @xmath783 .",
    "these @xmath784 are not pairwise distinct since there are basis vectors with two nonzero entries .",
    "since @xmath785 acts transitively on @xmath7 , we can assume @xmath786 .",
    "using the above basis , we get @xmath787 where @xmath788 we now restrict to @xmath58 .",
    "we have @xmath789 only when the matrices for @xmath790 and @xmath791 have nonzero entries on the diagonal , or if @xmath790 and @xmath791 have nonzero entries at the @xmath340-th row @xmath400-th column and @xmath400-th row @xmath340-th column , respectively .",
    "this can only happen when @xmath792 for some @xmath793 .",
    "we can list all the ways this can happen for @xmath794 or @xmath795 with @xmath796 ( keeping in mind that @xmath797 and @xmath798 ) :      to calculate the derivatives , let @xmath805 be the 4 by 4 matrix formed by the intersections of the first , second , @xmath806-th , and @xmath807-th rows and columns of @xmath142 , and let @xmath808 be the @xmath809 by @xmath809 matrix formed by the intersections of the remaining rows and columns .",
    "the space of all such @xmath808 is isomorphic to @xmath810 , and we denote the cartan subalgebra of diagonal matrices of this space by @xmath811 .",
    "all six of the above derivatives evaluate to the same polynomial in @xmath811 times the corresponding derivative in @xmath812 ; for instance , @xmath813 with @xmath814 and @xmath815 $ ] .",
    "thus , we can reduce our problem to @xmath812 , and straightforward computations verify ( [ eqn : identity ] ) for @xmath812 .",
    "similarly , when @xmath816 ( that is , when the term is of the form @xmath817 ) , all computations will reduce to analogous ones in @xmath818 .",
