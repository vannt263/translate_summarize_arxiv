    "the geometrical characterization of granular media ( grains , pores , fibers , etc . ) is an important issue in materials and process sciences . indeed ,",
    "several granular media can be modeled as random sets where the heterogeneity of the particles is studied with a probabilistic approach @xcite . in this context , the random closed sets ( racss ) have been particularly studied @xcite to get geometrical characteristics of such granular media .",
    "a racs denotes a random variable defined on a probability space @xmath0 valued in @xmath1 , the family of closed subsets of @xmath2 provided with the @xmath3-algebra @xmath4 , where @xmath5 denotes the class of compact subsets on @xmath2 . in a probabilistic point of view",
    ", the distribution of a convex racs is uniquely determined from the choquet capacity functional @xcite .",
    "however , such a description is not suitable for explicitly determining the geometrical shape of the racs .",
    "an alternative way is to describe a racs by the probability distribution of real - valued geometrical characteristics ( area , perimeter , diameters , etc . ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show how such characteristics can be used to describe the geometrical shape of a convex random closed set in @xmath6 .",
    "it has already been shown @xcite that the moments of the feret diameter of a  convex random closed set in @xmath6 can be obtained by the area measures on morphological transforms of it . a feret diameter ( also known as caliper diameter )",
    "is a measure of a set size along a specified direction .",
    "it can be defined as the distance between the two parallel planes restricting the set perpendicular to that direction .",
    "a set @xmath7 is said to be central symmetric or , more simply , symmetric if it is equal to the set @xmath8 .",
    "note that the feret diameter is not sensitive to such a central symmetrization @xcite .",
    "indeed , for a nonempty compact convex set @xmath9 , its symmetrized set @xmath10 ( see @xcite ) has the same feret diameter as @xmath11 .",
    "consequently , the feret diameter of a convex set @xmath11 is not enough to fully reconstruct @xmath11 ( but only its symmetrized set ) .",
    "however , the feret diameter is still useful to describe the shape of convex sets for two reasons .",
    "firstly , a convex set @xmath11 and its symmetrized set @xmath12 share a lot of common geometrical descriptors ( perimeter , eccentricity , etc . ) .",
    "secondly , there are many applications in which symmetric convex particles are considered . in this way",
    ", the reported work is focused on the symmetric convex sets ( i.e. , @xmath13 ) . by abusing the notation ,",
    "the conditions `` nonempty and compact '' will be often omitted in this paper . in other words , without explicit mentioning of the contrary , a _ convex set _ will refer to a nonempty compact convex set .    in this paper",
    ", we show that the feret diameter of a random symmetric convex set can be used to define some approximations of it as random zonotopes .",
    "the polygonal approximation of a deterministic convex set has already been studied several times @xcite . however , in most cases , the approximation is made by using the support function , which is not available in most of the geometric stochastic models .",
    "random polygons have already been studied several times @xcite .",
    "however , they are defined in different ways and for other objectives , and they are not characterized from their feret diameters . in our point of view , a zonotope ( which is a minkowski sum of line segments ) is described by its faces ( direction and length ) and can be characterized by its feret diameter .",
    "we will show that the feret diameter of a symmetric convex set evaluated on a finite number of directions @xmath14 can be used to define some approximations of it as zonotope .",
    "such zonotope approximations will be generalized to the random symmetric convex sets .",
    "therefore , a random symmetric convex set will be approximated by a random zonotope , and such approximations will be characterized from the feret diameter of the random symmetric convex set .",
    "the considered random zonotope will be uniquely determined by the lengths of its faces , and their directions will be assumed to be known .",
    "the approximations considered are consistent as @xmath15 with respect to the hausdorff distance .",
    "this work is a preliminary study in order to describe the geometrical characteristics of a population of convex particles in the context of image analysis .",
    "indeed , such images of population of convex particles can be modeled by stochastic geometric models .",
    "in such a model , the projection of a  particle represented by a random convex set . consequently , this work can be used to get information on such convex particles .",
    "in addition , when the particles are supposed to be symmetric , they have a symmetric 2-d projection that can be fully characterized by the feret diameter .",
    "such a symmetric hypothesis is suitable in several industrial applications in chemical engineering ( gas absorption , distillation , liquid  liquid extraction , petroleum processes , crystallization , etc . ) .",
    "an area of application is the gas ",
    "liquid reactions . indeed in a such process",
    ", the gas bubbles can be modeled as an ellipsoid the 2-d projections of which are ellipses ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the main area of application is crystals manufacturing . indeed , many crystals are 3-d zonohedrons , and their 2-d projections are zonotopes .",
    "for example , the crystals of oxalate ammonium @xcite , the crystals of calcium oxalate dihydrate @xcite , or the ( l)-glutamic acid @xcite . in such applications ,",
    "the considered approximations coincide with the real data .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the first part is devoted to the case of a  deterministic symmetric convex set @xmath11 .",
    "some properties of the feret diameter are first recalled , and then for any integer @xmath14 , an approximation @xmath16 of @xmath11 as a zonotope @xcite is described .",
    "it is shown that this approximation is consistent as @xmath15 with respect to the distance @xcite . a  more accurate zonotope approximation @xmath17 of @xmath11 that is invariant up to a rotation",
    "is also defined with the consistency also satisfied .",
    "this approximation is particularly interesting to describe the geometrical shape of @xmath11 .",
    "the second part is devoted to a characterization of the random zonotopes .",
    "first , we explore some properties of the random process associated with the feret diameter",
    ". then we study the random zonotopes , define some their classes , and discuss their descriptions by their faces .",
    "finally , we study the characterization of some random zonotopes from their feret diameters random process .",
    "in the last part , we study a random symmetric convex set @xmath11 .",
    "we show that it can still be described as precisely as we want by a random zonotope @xmath16 and up to a rotation by a random zonotope @xmath18 with respect to the hausdorff distance . we give the properties of these approximates and",
    "show that they can be characterized from the feret diameter random process of @xmath11 .",
    "in particular , the mean and autocovariance of the feret diameter random process of @xmath11 can be used to get the mean and the variances of the random vectors composed by the face lengths of their zonotope approximations .",
    "the aim of this section is to discuss how a convex set @xmath11 can be described as a zonotope .",
    "we will show that @xmath11 can always be approximated as precisely as we want by zonotopes and how such zonotopes can be characterized from the feret diameter of  @xmath11 .",

    "the support function of @xmath11 is defined as @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the euclidean dot product .",

    "items  [ it : positivementhomogene ] and [ it : sousadditive ] relate the convexity of the support function , and expression allows the reconstruction of a convex set from its support function .",
    "note that the positive homogeneity of the support function involves that it can be completely determined on the euclidean unit sphere .",
    "we adopt the following representation for the support function of @xmath11 : @xmath35 which is a continuous and @xmath36-periodic function .",
    "note that the feret diameter of a convex set @xmath11 , denoted @xmath37 , can be expressed by the support function as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the usual notation for the symmetric set @xmath40 .",
    "it is easy to see that the feret diameter of @xmath11 coincides with the support function of @xmath41 , where @xmath25 denotes the minkowski sum .",
    "therefore , the functional @xmath37 is sufficient to fully characterize the symmetrized body @xmath12 .",
