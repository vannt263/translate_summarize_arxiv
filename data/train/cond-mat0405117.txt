    "there is at present no paradigmatic ` non - fermi liquid ' in more than one dimension , in the same sense as there is the luttinger liquid in the 1d case .",
    "it is therefore of continuous interest to study failures of the fermi liquid concept in special cases , accessible to concrete calculation .",
    "the behavior of electrons in the presence of localized obstructions has long been a fertile ground for investigating deviations from simple fermi liquid behavior .",
    "examples are the quantum hall effect  @xcite , the kondo problem  @xcite , localization by impurities  @xcite , and the mott metal - to - insulator transition  @xcite .",
    "all of these save the last involve fixed impurity distributions , and their unusual behavior is related to the creation of localized states in the presence of scatterers . because of this , states accessible to weak probes can not be understood in the picture of nearly independent quasiparticles .",
    "the mott transition is unique among the above because the localized obstructions are the mobile electrons themselves , due to the strong on - site repulsion between electrons of the opposite spin .",
    "this means translational invariance is not broken , and obstruction is dynamical , which makes the problem much more difficult than with quenched disorder . despite many contributions which have shaped our present understanding  @xcite , no picture of the mott transition has emerged to date , which convincingly describes the phenomenon in space and time .",
    "motivated by the mott problem in the charge - transfer limit , which is of primary interest for high - temperature superconductors  @xcite , the present work describes non - fermi liquid behavior in one model of the falicov - kimball  @xcite group , which are intermediate between the quenched - disorder case and the fully dynamical mott case : the disorder is heavy , but annealed . in this way",
    "translational invariance is restored at the level of the ensemble , while the dynamics still relates to static disorder .",
    "the present model is the only one in the group in which the disorder is truly geometric , _",
    "i.e. _ quantum processes do not physically interact with any classical degree of freedom .",
    "this makes it an interesting test - bed for non - fermi liquid behavior , and indeed it is found that geometric obstruction induces collective behavior in the ` strange metal ' state beyond half - filling .",
    "it somewhat resembles normal @xmath0he at 0.5  k , where the entropy saturates at @xmath1 per atom  @xcite , simply because the atoms push against each other , obstructing kinetic motion . in the limit of low hopping overlap",
    ", the model develops an unexpected similarity to the kauzmann paradox  @xcite in vitreous liquids , despite the fact that all calculations are at equilibrium , so one can not speak of kinetic slow - down in the usual sense .    for intermediate - to - large overlaps ,",
    "the model appears at first sight as a renormalized fermi liquid .",
    "however , the ` equilibrium thermopower , ' @xmath2 , behaves exactly oppositely to what is predicted from the effective one - particle density of states ( 1@xmath3-dos ) at the same temperature and filling .",
    "this persistence of quantum collectivity is observed because geometric obstructions take the form of boundary conditions , so they can not be suppressed by hopping fluctuations .",
    "the technique used to analyze the equilibrium properties of the model is presented here for the first time .",
    "it enables one to find a closed analytical expression for the free energy .",
    "the essential idea is to remain in the fock space of the mobile fermions , while evaluating the logarithm of the annealed partition function .",
    "the one - particle part of this logarithm is then itself a one - particle operator in fock space , and can be diagonalized exactly , just like any tight - binding hamiltonian .",
    "with such a careful treatment of pauli correlations , it is sufficient to expand the annealed free energy to the first non - trivial term in a kubo cluster cumulant expansion  @xcite .",
    "the resulting analytical expression is exactly correct in both the atomic and metallic limits , and qualitatively compares well with numerical calculations on similar models .",
    "the geometric falicov - kimball model used here has been introduced previously  @xcite .",
    "it is given by the following modification of the well - known emery ( three - band ) model  @xcite : @xmath4 where @xmath5 describes the four oxygen @xmath3-orbitals around a copper @xmath6-orbital , and @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 are the number operators of the copper and oxygen sites .",
    "notice that only up - spins can hop .",
    "this is a simple realization of the idea behind gutzwiller s approximation : fermions of one spin orientation see those of the other ` as if occupying a band of width zero '  @xcite .",
    "the static down - spins are scattered at random . if one lands on an oxygen site , it pays the price of a charge - transfer energy @xmath10 between oxygen and copper , but is otherwise inactive .",
    "thus the mobile up - spins see a lattice with defects , different for each arrangement of down - spins .",
    "the situation is summarized in figure  [ fig_rtm ] .",
    "( for those familiar with the emery model , note that the up- and down - spins here correspond to physical holes in the copper @xmath6-orbitals , not electrons . )    in this variant of the falicov - kimball  @xcite model , there is no physical scattering off the heavy classical spins .",
    "instead the mobile spins see a ` torn ' lattice with open boundary conditions where the hopping has been turned off .",
    "thus they are in the strong - coupling limit on the one hand , and there is no singularity in their hamiltonian , on the other .",
    "now there intervenes a significant topological simplification , namely the ` crosses ' of hopping overlaps impinging on copper sites tile the plane , as visible in fig .",
    "this gives the model its name , random - tiling ( rt ) model , and makes it possible to express the annealed free energy of the problem by a kubo cluster - cumulant expansion without leaving the fock space of up - spins  @xcite .",
    "double occupation of copper sites is disallowed by a separate factor @xmath11 in the partition function , with @xmath12 .",
    "this factor is not entangled with the hamiltonian , so it is not an interaction , but pure bookkeeping , to force all the mobile spins away from the ` torn ' part of the lattice .",
    "the projector @xmath13 in eq .",
    "( [ rt ] ) is treated exactly , which is essential  @xcite : both the pauli principle and the geometric obstruction are treated on an equal footing .",
    "one projects the fock - space kubo expansion onto the single - particle subspace , and keeps the first non - trivial term , while higher single - particle terms can be shown to be negligible .",
    "this gives a one - particle quantum free - energy operator , whose spectrum can be exactly obtained in closed form .",
    "it is built from up - spin wave functions which anneal the geometric disorder .",
    "it provides the effective background for all residual ( two - particle ) interactions , so it is of interest to study by itself .",
    "the mott - hubbard transition has already been studied in some detail  @xcite .",
    "the present section is purely technical , and quite independent of the rest of the article .",
    "it describes how the annealed free energy of the random - tiling model can be written without leaving the fock space of up - spins .",
    "the one - particle part of this expression takes the form of a rapidly convergent cluster cumulant expansion around the atomic limit .",
    "the main strength of the procedure is that it never violates either the geometric or the pauli constraints . in particular",
    ", it is shown that the same closed expression exactly recovers the metallic free - fermion limit for the up - spins , when the down - spin concentration goes to zero .",
    "this is the _ opposite _ limit from the atomic one , which attests to the advantage of working in fock space .",
    "such physical considerations are collected in the last part of this section , to which one may prefer to skip at first reading .",
    "the physical picture described above corresponds at equilibrium to the evaluation of the canonical partition function @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the hamiltonian  ( [ rt ] ) , under the geometric constraint , that mobile up - spins do not land on the copper sites occupied by the down - spins , to which the hopping has been turned off by the projector in  ( [ rt ] ) .",
    "as already mentioned above , this is implemented by actually evaluating the unconstrained trace of @xmath16 where the disentangled term @xmath17 enforces the constraint , with @xmath18(the form with @xmath19 turns out to be more convenient for later manipulation . )",
    "it puts the mobile up - spins onto that part of the lattice which is not ` torn ' by the down - spins on copper sites , acting through the projector @xmath20 in eq .",
    "( [ rt ] ) .",
    "one can easily put @xmath21 in the final expressions , but it is neater to keep a finite @xmath22 .",
    "as expected , the results are numerically independent of @xmath23 in this limit .",
    "the trace over down - spins in eq .",
    "[ uz ] is trivial to perform , and results in rather laborious expressions of the generic form @xmath24 here @xmath25 are site - labelled operators in the fock space of up - spins , essentially the crosses in fig .",
    "[ fig_rtm ] .",
    "this is obvious , since a given configuration of down - spins corresponds to some choice of @xmath26 lattice sites where the hopping survives , out of a total @xmath27 sites ( @xmath27 is volume ) comprising the lattice @xmath28 .",
    "note that @xmath29 is a function of fock - space operators for the up - spins .",
    "it is something like @xmath30,\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the site hamiltonian .",
    "the @xmath32 are the thermal evolution operators for the annealed disorder with @xmath26 hopping crosses present .",
    "the main point of the method used here is to reorganize expressions like ( [ ulm ] ) by a combinatorial inversion which is valid for arbitrary non - commuting operators .",
    "this allows one to extract the one - particle part of the free energy expansion exactly , and show that corrections to its first ( one - site ) term are controlled in the range of fillings of interest here .",
    "physically , the method boils down to a combinatorial interpretation of kubo s cluster cumulant formula for the free energy .",
    "this is explained at length in ref .",
    "@xcite , where these ideas are used to cover familiar ground .",
    "in particular , the reader is reminded that the expansion parameter , corresponding to the concentration in the classical virial expansion , is an occupation probability in the general case  @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "one implements kubo s formalism by first performing the combinatorial inversion at the level of the stochastic evolution operators  ( [ ulm ] ) , and taking the logarithms only in the last step . to be explicit ,",
    "introduce the binomial transform    @xmath33    when one of these expressions is inserted into the other , the result is an identity , so they are valid independently of what the @xmath32 may be",
    ". then a very short exercise shows that the generating function for the @xmath32 s may be expressed in terms of the @xmath34 as @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "this result depends only on the relation ( [ invb ] ) , and in particular , nothing is assumed about commutativity . since the @xmath32 are canonical evolution operators , the sum in ( [ fiz ] ) is the corresponding grand canonical operator .",
    "hence @xmath38 involves the chemical potential for the hopping crosses , @xmath39 , say . in the present context , it will be more convenient to express the expansion parameter @xmath40 in terms of the chemical potential of the static down - spins , call it @xmath41 . since the hopping cross is absent",
    "when the down spin is present on a copper site , the two chemical potentials are effectively connected by a particle - hole transformation . when the energy origin is conveniently chosen so that @xmath42",
    ", this amounts to @xmath43 , i.e. @xmath44 for the range of concentrations considered in this article , half - filling and beyond , the chemical potential of the static down - spins will turn out to be at the oxygen energy , @xmath45 , so that @xmath40 is exponentially small .",
    "thus it provides rapid convergence in the expansion of the one - particle part of eq .",
    "( [ uz ] ) for these concentrations .      set the bare copper energy @xmath42 . in emery - model jargon ,",

    "the number of oxygen sites per unit cell is @xmath58 . in the next section , the logarithm of eq .",
    "( [ op ] ) will be explicitly computed in fock space .",
    "assume for now that this has been done , and that the one - particle operator in braces in ( [ op ] ) has been diagonalized .",
    "then the trace can also be performed in the space of up - spins . introducing a chemical potential @xmath59 for these latter",

    "is physically transparent : there are static down - spins , sitting in one level at @xmath42 , and @xmath58 levels at the oxygen energy @xmath70 .",
    "the last term , affecting the count of down - spins , comes from the interaction with the up - spins , as coded by the dependence of their dispersion on @xmath41 .",
    "this dispersion is derived in the next section , giving a complete , closed model .",
    "its dependence on the chemical potential of the down - spins is expected on general thermodynamic grounds , since the presence of down - spins affects the configurations available to up - spins .      in the previous section ,",
    "the binomial transform was used to treat the stochastic evolution operator induced by the geometric constraint ( annealment ) .",
    "the manipulations were mostly an exercise in bookkeeping . in this section ,",
    "the pauli constraint is considered , and the main tool is the evaluation of analytic functions of matrix arguments .",
    "this is the straightforward way to evaluate analytic functions of fock space operators , if one is only interested in the resulting one - particle part .",
    "analytic functions of matrix arguments are evaluated as usual , by diagonalization : @xmath71 to prepare the ground requires , however , one last combinatorial trick .",
    "namely , take the @xmath72 in ( [ ulm ] ) to be @xmath73",
    ". then @xmath74 can play the role of an ` @xmath75 ' in ( [ ulm ] ) , since @xmath76 in ( [ prvi ] ) is a sum over _ all _ site - indexed terms , each playing the role of an ` @xmath25 ' in ( [ ulm ] ) .",

    "let us first summarize the physical truncations made in the preceding derivation .",
    "two distinct meanings of ` first non - trivial term ' were employed .",
    "one is to keep to the one - particle part of the fock space .",
    "this is guaranteed by the fock - space formalism itself , or more technically by the fact that one has passed from operators to numbers only in the last step of the calculation , when diagonalizing the operator  ( [ heff ] ) .",
    "the other is to keep to first order in the expansion in @xmath40 .",
    "this is a little more tricky , because the final spectrum  ( [ spec ] ) of the free energy is non - linear in @xmath40 . here ` first - order ' actually means first - order at the level of the evolution operator .",
    "this is especially evident in the forms  ( [ heff ] ) and  ( [ heff ] ) .",
    "operationally , the rule is to keep to first order in @xmath40 under the logarithm , but the one - particle part of the resulting logarithmic operator must be extracted exactly , _",
    "i.e. _ without further truncation in @xmath40 .",
    "the above one - particle effective free energy is formally the first ( one - site ) non - trivial term in an expansion around the atomic limit . in terms of the expansion parameter @xmath102 , where @xmath41 is the chemical potential of the down - spins ,",
    "this is an expansion around @xmath105 , when the copper sites are completely occupied by down - spins .",
    "it will now be shown that the result is correct also for @xmath106 , which means no down - spins at all ( @xmath107 ) . then the exact non - interacting band is recovered .",
    "this is a very useful check that the two truncation prescriptions discussed in the previous paragraph are mutually consistent . in particular",
    ", it shows that keeping to first order in @xmath40 does not violate the pauli principle .",
    "this is a benefit of working in fock space  in similar expansions around the classical limit , the pauli correlations are only taken into account in an inclusion - exclusion procedure  @xcite , which remains approximate to all finite orders in the expansion parameter .",
    "taking @xmath107 in eq .",
    "( [ zeta ] ) , one gets @xmath108 putting all this together , the hopping amplitudes ( [ hops ] ) become @xmath109 which gives the dispersion for the free limit of the hamiltonian ( [ rt ] ) .",
    "this confirms that the one - particle part of the original problem has been treated correctly .",
    "it is also easy to verify that putting @xmath105 gives the same result as @xmath110 in the original hamiltonian , but this is of course expected .",
    "it will now be shown that the one - particle part of the expansion in @xmath40 is controlled , for the concentrations considered in this article .",
    "the higher order terms in @xmath40 contain one - particle contributions coming from the diagonalization of larger ` molecules , ' such as cu@xmath111o@xmath112 ( say ) , which appears when two ` hopping crosses ' share an oxygen .",
    "this has the typical structure of a connected - cluster expansion .",
    "the general term is @xmath113 . for down - spin concentrations beyond half - filling , the saddle - point equations give @xmath114 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath115 ( remember we put @xmath42 ) .",
    "note from eqs .",
    "( [ heff ] ) and  ( [ sincos ] ) that the magnitude of the term multiplying @xmath40 is roughly @xmath116 , so the overall estimate for the first term is @xmath117 .",

    "quickly saturate as a function of cluster size , they can not offset the addition of a whole bare @xmath120 with each new cu site added to a ` molecule . '",
    "hence the expansion is rapidly convergent in the range of fillings considered below .    for down - spin fillings below the mott transition , _",
    "i.e. _ corresponding to the lower hubbard band ( lhb ) , @xmath121 , meaning @xmath40 is some appreciable fraction of unity , not exponentially small . then presumably higher - order single - particle terms could play a role",
    "this is consistent with the fact that in the lhb , there is a significant contribution of the interaction to the entropy , while the same is exponentially small beyond the mott transition  the system goes from liquid to gas , absorbing latent heat  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that the exact band result is recovered in the limit @xmath106 suggests that the present calculation should not be qualitatively incorrect even in the lhb , not of main interest here .",

    "both @xmath59 and @xmath41 change with temperature , since the particle number is fixed for the up- and down - spins separately . in fig .",
    "[ fig_enup_t ] , the entropy of mobile spins is shown as a function of temperature , for two values of the bare hopping and several concentrations .",

    "the curve at @xmath126 even shows a ` kauzmann paradox '  @xcite , where extrapolation of the high - energy part would give a negative entropy at zero temperature . of course , the entropy is strictly zero at @xmath127 , since the free energy  ( [ model ] ) is microscopic by construction .",
    "the plateaus correspond to regions of low @xmath125 , associated with the difficulty of finding new states , which gives peaks in @xmath125 ( not shown ) between @xmath127 and the plateau positions .",
    "the plateaus are identified with static disorder in the obstructed copper sites .",
    "the proof is as follows : call the concentration of up - spins on the coppers @xmath128 .",
    "if they were static , their contribution to the entropy would be just @xmath129 and beyond half - filling , each copper site would be singly occupied , either by an up - spin or a down - spin .",

    "this means that in the regime @xmath134 , excitation of the system proceeds in two steps .",
    "first the copper positional degrees of freedom are fully saturated : their entropy can not be greater than that of the correspondig static disorder .",

    "the chemical potential traverses the band fairly rapidly as the temperature increases , and leaves it roughly around the temperature at which the plateau appears .",

    "it has been noted  @xcite that the two calculations in fig .",
    "[ fig_cv_hubb ] differ significantly in their outcomes .",
    "first , in the qmc results the first peak loses strength much faster with decreasing doping .",

    ", the first peak is expected to scale with the non - interacting bandwidth @xmath152 , so its position should not depend on concentration , except insofar as due to the changing position of the fermi level .",
    "this is visible in the left column of fig .",
    "[ fig_cv ] .",
    "the first peak there barely moves , but it moves a little more in the bottom left panel , where the non - interacting band is wider , so the fermi level shifts more rapidly with concentration .",
    "also , the narrower the lhb , the sharper the first peak , and the more persistent as the concentration decreases .",
    "this suggests a physical interpretation of the differences in fig .",
    "[ fig_cv_hubb ] .",
    "the qmc heat capacities imply that the effective band seen by one - band hubbard electrons below half - filling rapidly widens as the concentration decreases .",
    "the lanczos calculation implies a situation similar to the present model in the lhb : band - width independent of concentration , and the effective band somewhat narrower than the qmc prediction .    to summarize , below half - filling the present analytical method gives similar qualitative behavior of thermodynamic quantities as other , numerically much more involved treatments of one - band models .",
    "it is also quantitatively correct in the known exact limits , of high and low temperature , and high and low doping . where it can be checked quantitatively in the intermediate regime , namely in fig",
    ".  [ fig_sscu_t ] , it is correct as well .",
    "it misses the gap in the up - spin spectrum around half - filling , replacing it with a br bandwidth collapse , presumably because it retains only one - particle terms in the fock - space free energy operator .",
    "the doping dependence above half - filling is qualitatively different than expected from the one - band analogy . at fixed hamiltonian parameters ,",
    "there is a transfer of spectral weight to a new scale , which emerges only with doping .",
    "the new scale is connected with interband excitations across the renormalized charge - transfer gap .",
    "the present calculation also parallels lanczos calculations on the hubbard model , both in the shape and behavior of the peaks in the heat capacity below half - filling .",
    "the main modelling interest of the present article was to determine when the one - particle construction , adopted to calculate the free energy , indeed corresponds to a fermi liquid , and when it does not .",
    "for that purpose , a minimal negative criterion to observe a non - fermi liquid at a finite temperature was adopted .",
    "a system is not a fermi liquid if the susceptibilities do not follow from the 1@xmath3-dos at that temperature .",
    "put conversely , a necessary condition for a system to be a fermi liquid is that the 1@xmath3-dos responds ` rigidly ' to an infinitesimal change in temperature .",
    "it has been found previously  @xcite that the mott transition in the rt model is first order , from a liquid of light particles , in the lower hubbard band , to a gas of heavy ones , in the renormalized in - gap band .",
    "( while the down - spin entropy drops to zero at the transition , indicating af order , the chemical potential is a monotonous function of the filling , _",
    "i.e. _ there is no phase separation . ) in the present work , it is shown that while the liquid is a fermi liquid , the gas is not .",
    "the absence of residual interactions ( which makes it a gas ) has been bought at the price of an anomalous variation of the effective mass with the temperature , such that the thermopower susceptibility ( [ thermo ] ) can not be predicted from the 1@xmath3-dos at any given temperature .",
    "this remains so even if the hopping overlap is large , because the model is always in the strong - coupling limit : changing the hopping does not affect the geometric obstructions , as obvious from eq .",
    "( [ rt ] ) .",
    "the collectivity involved is very simple .",
    "the fermions need to agree which are the best positions for the annealed impurities , in precise analogy to @xmath0he atoms pushing against each other .    at low hopping overlap ,",
    "this geometric effect so dominates the mean properties of the gas , that it is unable to find new states of motion in a range of temperatures , giving rise to plateaus in the entropy .",
    "( extrapolating experimental trends  @xcite , one could imagine similar plateaus appearing in @xmath0he around 0.5  k , if the pressure were sufficiently increased . )",
    "these are remarkably similar to kauzmann plateaus in vitreous liquids , where they are due to the configurational rearrangements falling out of equilibrium .",
    "clearly the kauzmann phenomenon  @xcite is a non - specific sign that kinetic exploration of configuration space has been obstructed , whatever the responsible mechanism .",
    "here it has an interesting connection with the brinkmann - rice ( br ) bandwidth collapse  @xcite , which is signalled in fig .",
    "[ fig_enup_t ] by a steep rise of the entropy from zero temperature at half - filling , indicating an infinite effective mass . by the same token",
    ", the entropy plateau means that the effective mass is zero , and it is obtained by continuous deformation of the br entropy curves with doping .",
    "it may seem surprising that obstruction of kinetic motion should be associated with zero thermodynamic effective mass , but note that in the absence of new states , there can be neither conduction nor dissipation .",
    "zero effective mass is just the equilibrium version of what is observed in the hall effect : the longitudinal hall conductance and resistance simultaneously drop to ( almost ) zero at the steps in the transverse resistance , precisely because most of the carriers are localized  @xcite .    the place of the present calculation among various cluster approaches is simple to state . it is the ordinary kubo cluster cumulant expansion of the annealed free energy , with the single proviso that it is calculated in fock space . the transition from operators to numbers is made at the very end , after the single - particle fock term has been extracted .",
    "it is theoretically quite revealing that the results presented here could be obtained by diagonalizing a single cuo@xmath119 molecule , _ i.e. _ the lowest non - trivial term in the underlying cluster expansion .",
    "clearly , the main work was in fact done by the algebraic and combinatorial machinery which respectively enforced both the pauli principle and the geometric constraint .",
    "once these kinematical issues were properly separated from the dynamical ones , it turned out the problem was dominated by the former .",
    "this outcome is physically plausible by adiabatic arguments : the low - energy physics of the falicov - kimball model is not controlled by any elaborate dynamical correlations , such as one would expect in the mott case , where the scatterers and the scattered are equally light .",
    "it is also consistent with the previous observation  @xcite that the system is a gas beyond half - filling . in the lower hubbard band , where it is a liquid",
    ", higher - order clusters should affect the results , but that is not expected to be qualitatively significant .",
    "the comparison with other , numerically much heavier calculations in the preceding section gives some grounds for reflection on the mott problem .",
    "this has been dominated for the past forty years by gutzwiller s intuitions  @xcite , that electrons of one spin see those of the other as a ` smeared background ' ( gutzwiller ansatz ) , and further ` as if occupying a band of width zero ' ( gutzwiller approximation ) .",
    "this point of view clearly implies there should be some similarity between falicov - kimball and hubbard - model low - energy behavior .",
    "such a similarity appears to have been found in one of the calculations cited above  @xcite , in the smooth evolution of the entropy as @xmath173 was raised from zero to one .",
    "if one knew that gutzwiller s proposals were correct , the very similar evolution of the entropy , observed in the present calculation as @xmath175 was increased , would be naturally expected .",
    "as things stand , one should keep in mind the alternative resonating - valence - bond ( rvb ) scenario of anderson  @xcite , in which quantum coherence between the two spin orientations is an essential ingredient of mott s insulating ground state .",
    "thus the possibility remains open , that the falicov - kimball limit acts as a kind of trap for all approximate treatments of the hubbard model which incidentally destroy this coherence , over time or space .",
    "it is also of some interest that the heat capacities in the rt model are qualitatively more similar to numerical hubbard model results , than to one - band falicov - kimball results .",
    "it is possible that the oxygen degree of freedom plays a role analogous to the ` other ' spin in the one - band hubbard model .    to conclude ,",
    "geometric obstruction in thermodynamic equilibrium has been explored in an analytic single - particle quantum model of falicov - kimball type . in the regime @xmath134 ,",
    "it gives rise to a plateau in the entropy of mobile spins . for @xmath177 ,",
    "the mobile spins appear to be normally metallic , only with renormalized parameters . beyond half - filling ,",
    "their equilibrium thermopower susceptibility nevertheless reflects the microscopic kinematic restrictions , behaving oppositely to what is expected from the single - particle properties .",
