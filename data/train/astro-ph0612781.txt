    "objects of different scale and nature in the universe : from young and very old stars to galactic nuclei show existence of collimated outbursts - jets . geometrical sizes of jets lay between parsecs and megaparsecs .",
    "the origin of jets is not well understood and only several qualitative mechanisms are proposed which are not justified by calculations .",
    "theory of jets must give answers to three main questions : how jets are formed ?",
    "how are they stabilized ?",
    "how do they radiate ?",
    "the last question is related to the problem of the origin if relativistic particles in outbursts from agn , where synchrotron emission is observed .",
    "relativistic particles , ejected from the central machine rapidly loose their energy so the problem arises of particle acceleration inside the jet , see review of bisnovatyi - kogan ( 1993 ) .",
    "it is convenient sometimes to investigate jets in a simple model of infinitely long circular cylinder , chandrasekhar & fermi ( 1953 ) .",
    "the magnetic field in the collimated jets determines its direction , and the axial current may stabilize the jet s elongated form at large distances from the source ( e.g. in agns ) , ( bisnovatyi - kogan et al . , 1969 ) , see also istomin and pariev ( 1996 ) , beskin ( 2005 ) .",
    "when observed with high angular resolution these jets show a structure with bright knots separated by relatively dark regions ( thomson et al . , 1993 ) .",
    "high percentages of polarization , sometimes exceeding 50% , indicate the nonthermal nature of the radiation , which is well explained as synchrotron emission of the relativistic electrons in an ordered magnetic field .",
    "estimates of the lifetime of these electrons , based on the observed luminosities and spectra , often give values much less than the kinematic ages @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the distance of the emitting point from the central source .",
    "there is a necessity of continuous re - acceleration of the electrons in the jets in order to explain the observations .",
    "the acceleration mechanism for electrons in extragalactic jets proposed by bisnovatyi - kogan & lovelace ( 1995 ) , considers that intense long - wavelength electromagnetic oscillations accompany a relativistic jet , and the electromagnetic wave amplitudes envisioned are sufficient to give in situ acceleration of electrons to the very high energies observed @xmath2 ev .",
    "it was assumed that jets are formed by a sequence of outbursts from the nucleus with considerable charge separation at the moment of the outburst .",
    "the direction of motion of the outbursts is determined by the large - scale magnetic field .",
    "when the emitted wave is strong enough it washes out the medium around and the density can become very small , consisting only of the accelerated particles .",
    "the action of the oscillating knot is similar to the action of a pulsar , considered as an inclined magnetic rotator .",
    "both emit strong electromagnetic waves , which could effectively accelerate particles .",
    "the model of enhanced oscillations of the cylinder , and electromagnetic field around it , have been studied by bisnovatyi - kogan ( 2004 ) .",
    "here we consider stabilization of a jet by pure magnetohydrodynamic mechanism , connected with torsional oscillations .",
    "such type of oscillations in neutron stars had been considered by bastrukov et al .",
    "we suggest that the matter in the jet is rotating , and different parts of the jet rotate in different directions .",
    "such distribution of the rotational velocity produces azimuthal magnetic field , which prevents a disruption of the jet .",
    "the jet remains to be in a dynamical equilibrium , when it is representing a periodical , or quasiperiodical structure along the axis , and its radius is oscillating with time all along the axis",
    ". the space and time period of oscillations depend on the conditions at jet formation : the length scale , the amplitude of the rotational velocity , and the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "the time period of oscillations should be obtained during construction of the dynamical model , what also should show at which input parameters may exist a long jet , stabilized by torsional oscillations .",
    "2d nonstationary mhd calculations are needed , to solve the problem numerically . here",
    "we construct a very simplified model of this phenomena , which , nonetheless , permits to confirm the reality of such stabilization , to estimate the range of parameters at which is takes place , and the connection between the time and space scales , magnetic field strength , and the amplitude of rotational velocity .",
    "axially symmetric mhd equations at @xmath3 , for the perfect gas with an infinite conductivity , are written , in cylindric coordinates @xmath4 , in the form ( landau and lifshits , 1982 ; bisnovatyi - kogan , 2001 )    @xmath5    @xmath6    @xmath7    @xmath8=0,\\ ] ]    @xmath9    @xmath10    @xmath11,\\ ] ]    @xmath12    @xmath13    @xmath14    @xmath15    @xmath16    @xmath17=-f\\ ] ]    @xmath18    here @xmath19 is the velocity vector , @xmath20 is the magnetic field vector , @xmath21 is the vector of the electrical current , @xmath22 are density , pressure , and internal energy , respectively , @xmath23 is the cooling function , due to photons or neutrino .",
    "we consider a long cylinder with a magnetic field directed along its axis .",
    "this cylinder will expand unlimitly under the action of pressure and magnetic forces , so no confinement will be reached . the limitation of the radius of this cylinder could be possible in dynamic state , when the whole cylinder undergoes magneto - torsional oscillations .",
    "such oscillations produce toroidal field , which prevent a radial expansion .",
    "there is a competition between the induced toroidal field , compressing the cylinder in radial direction , and gas pressure , together with the field along the cylinder axis ( poloidal ) , tending to increase its radius.during magneto - torsional oscillations there are phases , when either compression or expansion forces prevail , and , depending on the input parameters , we may expect tree kinds of a behavior of such cylinder .",
    "the oscillation amplitude is low , so the cylinder suffers unlimited expansion ( no confinement )    \\2 .",
    "the oscillation amplitude is too high , so the pinch action of the toroidal field destroys the cylinder , and leads to formation of separated blobs .",
    "the oscillation amplitude is moderate , so the cylinder survives for an unlimited time , and its parameters ( radius , density , magnetic field etc . )",
    "change periodically , or quasi - periodically in time .",
    "solution of mhd equations ( [ eq1])-([eq14 ] ) could give , in principle , the answer about a correctness of the above scenario .",
    "it is reasonable nevertheless to try to find a simple approximate way for obtaining a qualitative answer , and to make a rough estimation of parameters leading to different regimes .",
    "we ll try to simplify the system of equations in such a way , that the resulting system should contain the most important property of the dynamical competition between different forces , to check the possibility of the dynamical confinement.we use for this purpose a profiling procedure .",
    "let us neglect the gravity in the the direction of the cylinder axis ( @xmath24 ) , and approximate density by a function @xmath25 , suggesting a uniform density along the radius . cylinder density .",
    "the components of the velocity and magnetic field are approximated as    @xmath26    @xmath27    in this case the current components ( [ eq9])-([eq11 ] ) are written as    @xmath28    after neglecting velocity @xmath29 along the axis , we should omit the corresponding euler equation ( [ eq3 ] ) , and the radial pressure gradient is approximated by the linear function    @xmath30    where the constant @xmath31 is connected with the equation of state , @xmath32 is the pressure , @xmath33 is the radius of the cylinder . in the subsequent consideration",
    "we consider an adiabatic case , where the polytropic equation of state @xmath34 is considered instead of the energy equation ( [ eq13 ] ) .",
    "neglecting the @xmath24 derivatives in the poisson equation ( [ eq12 ] ) , we obtain @xmath35 . substituting ( [ eq15])-([eq18 ] ) into the original system of the equations , we obtain for the profiling functions the following equations    @xmath36",

    "the frequency of non - linear oscillations is smaller , and we may write              on the edge of the cylinder the rotational velocity can not exceed the light velocity , so the solution with initial conditions in ( [ eq54 ] ) , corresponding to @xmath156 , has a physical sense only at @xmath157 . taking @xmath158 for a strongly non - linear oscillations",
