    "fourier analysis reveals the x - ray emission of low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) to be variable on short timescales , often with several characteristic quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ) peaks identified between @xmath8 hz and @xmath8 khz @xcite .",
    "the highest - frequency qpos , reaching up to @xmath9 hz and usually occurring in pairs , are of particular interest , as their periods correspond to the dynamical time - scale in the inner accretion disk , where strong - field effects of gravity are crucially important .",
    "there is no agreement as to the physical origin of the qpos @xcite . in the wealth of observational papers published on qpos ,",
    "many have studied the qpo properties as a function of count rate , luminosity , spectra , lower - frequency features and so on , but very few have focussed on the coherence time , which is in fact a very constraining parameter for qpo models . in this paper , we study the previously reported kilo - hz qpos in the x - ray burster , 4u 1608 - 52 , with the aim of characterizing the quality factor , and hence coherence time , of its qpo over a wide range of frequency .",
    "we have selected this source for two main reasons : first its qpos are known to be strong , and second in the qpo discovery paper of @xcite , a quality factor @xmath10 of up to @xmath3 was reported for the qpo , together with apparent correlations between its frequency and both its amplitude and width .",
    "we have retrieved the 1996 and 1998 data of 4u1608 - 52 from the rxte archive .",
    "these data have already been discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the 1996 data were recorded during the decline of an x - ray outburst , whereas the 1998 data sampled a whole outburst phase from the source . here , we have restricted the analysis to the _ science event _ unbinned data .",
    "we have thus excluded the 1996 march 6th data which were obtained in a binned data mode with no spectral information . as the sensitivity for qpo detection increases with the number of photons detected , we have selected only those observations in which the five rxte proportional counter array ( pca ) units were operating @xcite . this represents more than 250 kiloseconds of data .",
    "the dataset is divided into 21 segments recorded within different , sometimes consecutive , orbital revolutions of the satellite .",
    "we have computed leahy normalized fourier power density spectra ( pds ) between 1 and 2048 hz over 1 s intervals ( 1 hz resolution ) , using x - ray photons of energy between 2 and 40 kev .",
    "it is well known that the qpo frequency can vary by as much as 50 hz in a few thousand seconds .",
    "the goal of our analysis is to estimate q , while keeping the contribution of the frequency shifts as small as possible .",
    "this implies that the qpo profile properties have to be estimated on the shortest possible timescales . for 4u1608 - 52 , which shows strong qpos , this can usually be done with 32 s. so we have averaged 32 one - second pds and searched for a qpo peak using a sliding window algorithm , as described in @xcite . in segment 11 ,",
    "where the qpo is the weakest , we have averaged 128 one - second pds .",
    "we have preferred to use 32 summed 1 hz spectra rather than a single power spectrum obtained over , say , 32 s as in this way we can make a direct comparison with the results discussed below (  2.2 ) , which rely on having 1 s time resolution . using 32 s spectra would formally give better frequency resolution , but we have found that the reduction in the measured widths and the improvement in the uncertainties in the parameters are very small .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ dbarret_t3 ]      we have searched for the second qpo in the data using the shifted 32 s pds used above .",
    "we detect an otherwise invisible higher - frequency qpo in 5 of the 21 segments used here . a weaker signal is detected in segments 1 to 3 , 13 to 15 , 16 to 18 and 20 - 21 , which we group to obtain a meaningful fit .",
    "the results of fitting the higher - frequency qpos are listed in table [ dbarret_t3 ] .",
    "given the relatively large width of the high - frequency qpo , the window for the fit is 200 hz on each side of the qpo peak , excluding the region around the lower - frequency qpo .",
    "these qpos have been previously reported in @xcite .",
    "what is noticeable is that the higher - frequency qpo is much broader than the lower one , with q less than @xmath7 .",
    "this is a well known observational fact @xcite .",
    "interestingly , there is no apparent correlation between the coherence time of the higher frequency qpos and its frequency ( of the type seen in figure [ dbarret_f5 ] for the lower - frequency qpo ) , but we note that the frequencies do not span a wide range and that the error bars are relatively large .",
    "we have carried out a systematic study of the kilo - hz qpo of 4u1608 - 52 , with the aim of investigating the coherence time of the underlying oscillator . by following the lower kilo - hz qpo over the shortest timescales permitted by the data statistics ( down to 32 s ) to minimise the contribution of the long - term frequency drifts , with a shift - and - add technique , we have found a lower limit on the quality factor larger than @xmath11 in 14 of the 21 segments of analysed data .",
    "we have shown that in this object q is as high as 200 for thousands of seconds . in many sources",
    ", the strength of the signal does not allow the study of the qpos on such short timescales , which may explain why the q reported in the literature are generally lower than this .",
    "frequency drifts as large as 5 hz are observed between consecutive 32 s pds . in an attempt to remove the contribution of this short - term drift to the width of the qpo",
    ", we have applied the shift - and - add procedure to the 1 s pds , using a sliding - window technique to estimate the qpo frequency every second . if the frequency drift were linear over 32 s ,",
    "this method should remove the drift contribution to the width measured on 32 s and provide an estimate of the qpo width on a 1 s timescale .",
    "interestingly enough , the recovered qpo width is not significantly smaller than the width measured on 32 s. this surprising result could be explained by the fact that the error bars on the frequency are of the order of the expected gain , causing an artificial blurring of the qpo profile in the shift - and - add process .",
    "alternatively , this might be indication that the frequency , amplitude , or phase of the underlying signal varies on time scales much shorter than 32 s. in this case , this would most likely imply that the q factor reported in table [ dbarret_t1 ] with the present technique underestimates the intrinsic q of the qpo .    determining the coherence time of the underlying oscillator from the width of the qpo over the wide range of frequency spanned ( between 560 hz and 890 hz ) , we have shown that there is a clear pattern in which the coherence time increases with frequency up to a maximum at @xmath5 hz . at both ends of the frequency range",
    ", the decreasing strength of the qpo seems to be associated with a decrease of _ both _ its amplitude and its coherence .",
    "we now discuss the implications of the above results for qpo models .",
    "there are two different classes of models of the khz qpos : those involving clumps within or above the accretion disk ( e.g. , @xcite,@xcite for a recent review ) , and those involving oscillations of the disk ( reviewed in @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "if inhomogeneities can form in the accretion flow in the form of clumps which are more luminous than their surroundings and which orbit around the central star , the viewing geometry might be such that the clumps will produce luminosity variations @xcite .",
    "inhomogeneities lying at a radius r and having a radial extent @xmath12 will be sheared by differential rotation and will therefore have a finite lifetime .",
    "the maximum lifetime for such a clump to be stretched to an axisymmetric ring is given by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the keplerian period at radius r @xcite .",
    "in the clump model , this lifetime is comparable to the coherence time of the qpo @xmath15 .",
    "such clumps will produce a luminosity variation of at most @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "hence , @xmath17 , so high coherence of the signal and its high amplitude are incompatible in the clump model . in our case",
    "@xmath18 is of the order of 10% ( see figure [ dbarret_f6 ] ) .",
    "this would imply @xmath19 second ( or q @xmath20 ) , much shorter than the coherence time we found in our analysis ( see figure [ dbarret_f5 ] ) .",
    "it is also worth noting that in the above formula the clump lifetime ( and signal amplitude ) are predicted to decrease with increasing frequency , ( e.g. livio & bath 1982 ) , unlike the observed behaviour in figures [ dbarret_f5 ] and [ dbarret_f6 ] .",
    "this is clearly not what we observe in this source ( see figure [ dbarret_f6 ] ) .",
    "alternatively , one can make the assumption that the radial extent the blob is of the order of the disk height ( _ h _ ) .",
    "shakura and sunyaev ( 1973 ) estimate @xmath21 , and the radius of the relevant orbit is on the order of the stellar radius , or a few times larger . for an accreting neutron star with a large fraction of eddington luminosity , @xmath22 is a reasonable estimate , which again leads to the same conclusions .",
    "we have also found that the higher - frequency kilo - hz qpo is much fainter and is characterised by a much lower quality factor .",
    "this result is hard to reconcile with models in which the higher - frequency qpo is a keplerian frequency at some radius ( e.g. , the sonic point , @xcite ) , and the lower qpo is a beat frequency generated by interaction of the neutron star radiation with clumps originating at that particular radius .",
    "this model predicts that the width of the two qpos should be similar , because the stellar spin frequency is expected to be highly coherent . in 4u1608 - 52 , we have shown the width of the higher - frequency qpo to be much larger than the width of the lower - frequency qpo .",
    "another model of qpos has been proposed in which clumps leave the accretion disk and for some reason follow test particle orbits . in this so - called relativistic precession model ( e.g. stella & vietri 1999 )",
    ", the clump is responsible for all three frequencies : two kilo - hz qpos and a lower - frequency qpo , also called the horizontal branch oscillation .",
    "since the same agent is responsible for the two khz qpos , the coherence times should be about the same .",
    "we have shown here that the coherence time of the higher - frequency qpo is at least a factor of ten lower than that of the lower - frequency qpo ( see table 3 ) .",
    "more stable non - linear structures ( vortices ) may persist in the accretion disk , but these will be subject to radial inflow unless they are anchored by an external magnetic field @xcite . the inflow velocity at radius @xmath23 in an @xmath24-disk of thickness @xmath25 , is a factor of @xmath26 lower than the orbital velocity , where @xmath27 is the dimensionless viscosity .",
    "so , for typical disks , within @xmath7 orbits the fluid is carried inwards by a distance equal to a few per cent of its initial radius , and suffers a percentage change in orbital frequency which is 1.5 times larger .",
    "thus all models of this class seem to be incompatible with a high q factor , and the relationships found between the coherence time with frequency and rms amplitudes .",
    "there is growing evidence that the oscillations originate in the disk itself , in particular because the same phenomena are observed in a wide range of accreting x - ray sources , from white dwarfs to black holes @xcite .",
    "several models , relating qpos to disk oscillations have been proposed , some of them making clear predictions of what the quality factor of the qpo should be .",
    "this is the case , for instance , for the transition layer model proposed by @xcite . in this model ,",
    "a shock occurs where the keplerian disk adjusts to the sub - keplerian flow and the transition can undergo various types of oscillations under the influence of the gas , radiation , magnetic pressure , and gravitational force . in this case q can in principle reach 100 .",
    "it is expected to increase with frequency but also with luminosity ( @xcite ) . in our data",
    "set it is clear that there is not a good correlation between q and the source count rate .    for acoustic waves in isotropic turbulence @xcite predict @xmath28 .",
    "here @xmath29 is viscosity parameter for a shakura - sunyaev disk and the wavelength , @xmath30 , is much greater than @xmath25 , yielding a rather low value of @xmath31 .",
    "anisotropic turbulence increases this to @xmath32 , as observed in black holes . for g - modes and isotropic turbulence ,",
    "@xmath31 is the higher value of @xmath33 and @xmath34 , but the highest values of q are obtained for @xmath35-modes in anisotropic turbulence , @xmath36 . for c - modes , which correspond to a warp revolving at the lense - thirring frequency ( a general - relativistic effect ) , this value is enhanced by a factor approximately equal to the square of the ratio of orbital velocity to the speed of sound ( the discussion in this section follows @xcite ) . in the very hot disk around the neutron stars this enhancement may still be insufficient to explain the high q reported here .",
    "however , some modes are excited , rather than damped , by viscosity and may enter the non - linear regime @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the kilo - hz qpo in 4u1608 - 52 is a highly coherent signal with an inferred coherence time of up to about one tenth of a second .",
    "this result , as well as the dependence of the qpo coherence time on frequency and amplitude which we report are hard to reconcile with qpo models involving orbiting clumps . this leaves the accretion disk oscillations as the the most likely alternative for accounting for these signals .",
