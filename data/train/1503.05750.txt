    "the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the universe ( see @xcite and references therein ) has opened a new window in cosmological studies .",
    "indeed , the underlying physical process responsible for this phenomenon is considered as one of the fundamental problems in cosmology . within the framework of general relativity ,",
    "scalar fields provide possible dark energy models which can describe , but not so far explain , this acceleration .",
    "scalar field models require the choice of a self - interaction potential @xmath0 for the scalar field @xmath1 .",
    "the considerations of a specific potential @xmath0 is done by an adhoc requirement ( ansatz ) . in this manner",
    "various candidates have been proposed in the literature , such as an inverse power law , exponential , hyperbolic and the list goes on ( for review see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "one such ansatz , which we shall consider in the following , has been done by rubano and barrow @xcite ( see also @xcite ) who found that if the scalar field behaves as a perfect fluid then the potential @xmath2 , where the constants @xmath3 are given in terms of observable cosmological parameters , namely the dark - energy equation of state ( eos ) parameter and @xmath4 .",
    "obviously it is important to proposed potentials which are realistic and at the same time lead to exactly soluble models in the flrw spacetime .",
    "the reason for employing the noether symmetries is that noether symmetries provide us with the noether integrals which facilitate the analytic solution of the field equations . as an example , in extended theories of gravity , where the birkhoff theorem is not guaranteed , the noether approach provides a means of describing the global dynamics using the first integrals of motion @xcite .",
    "furthermore , besides the technical possibility of reducing the dynamical system , the first integrals of motion always give rise to conserved currents that are not only present in physical space - time but also in configuration spaces ( see discussion in @xcite ) . in space - time such currents are linear ( momentum , angular momentum etc . )",
    "but in configuration space the conserved quantities appear as relations between dynamical variables @xcite .",
    "the latter implies that in the configuration space ( minisuperspace ) , the first integrals are considered as `` selection rules '' for scalar field potentials and coupling functions in the case of modified gravity theories .",
    "the above features have inspired many authors to propose the admittance of a noether ( point or dynamical ) symmetry by the field equations as a selection rule for dark - energy models , including those of modified gravity @xcite .",
    "* *    in particular it has been shown that the dynamical noether symmetries are associated with the killing tensors of the space @xcite and that the noether point symmetries are related to the homothetic algebra of the space ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "therefore the requirement of a noether symmetry is indeed a geometric demand hence independent of the particular dynamics .",
    "in scalar field cosmology the system develops in minisuperspace whose geometry is defined by the field equations . therefore the requirement that the field equations admit a noether symmetry becomes , according to the above results , a geometric requirement on a geometry which is inherent to the system .    in this work by using a more general geometric criterion , i.e. by employing the lie point symmetries of the wheeler - dewitt ( wdw ) equation , we extend the work of rubano and barrow @xcite to a general family of hyperbolic scalar - field potentials @xmath0 .    in section [ sfc ] ,",
    "we give the basic theory of the scalar - field cosmology in a flrw spacetime .",
    "the basic definitions and results from the lie and noether point symmetries of partial differential equations and the application in the wdw equation are presented in section [ preliminaries ] . in section [ wdwsym ]",
    ", we consider our cosmological model , which includes a hyperbolic family of scalar field potentials with a perfect fluid with constant equation of state parameter @xmath5 .",
    "we study the existence of lie point symmetries of the wdw equation , where we find that for our model the wdw equation admits lie point symmetries if the free parameters of the potential and the parameter @xmath5 are related . in section [ exactsol ]",
    "we apply the lie point symmetries of the wdw equation in order to construct invariant solutions of the wdw equation and exact solutions of the field equations .",
    "also , in section [ dynanalysis ] we perform a dynamical analysis by studying the fixed points of the field equations in the dimensionless variables for the general model and we show that when the cosmological model is liouville integrable ( the model admits conservation laws ) , there is a unique stable point which describes the de sitter universe . finally , in section [ conclusion ] we draw some conclusions .",

    "@xmath22 is the energy - momentum tensor of baryonic  matter and radiation and @xmath23 is the energy - momentum tensor associated with the scalar field @xmath1 .",
    "modeling the expanding universe as a fluid ( which includes radiation , matter and de ) with @xmath24velocity @xmath25 , proper isotropic density @xmath26 and proper isotropic pressure @xmath27 gives @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the variable @xmath31 denotes the energy density of the scalar field and @xmath32 is the corresponding isotropic pressure .",
    "moreover the parameters @xmath33 of the scalar field are given by @xmath34    for the flrw spacetime , for comoving observers ( @xmath35 ) , the einstein field equations ( [ sf.03 ] ) are @xmath36 and @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the hubble function .    furthermore , assuming that the scalar field and matter do not interact , we have the  two conservation laws@xmath39@xmath40 while the corresponding equation of state ( eos ) parameters are given by @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "in what follows we assume a constant @xmath43 so that @xmath44 ( @xmath45 for cold matter and @xmath46 for  radiation ) , where @xmath47 is the matter density at the present time .",
    "generically , some high - energy field theories suggest that the dark energy eos parameter may be a function of cosmic time ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .    replacing ( [ sf.04 ] ) in ( [ sf.09 ] ) we have the klein - gordon equation@xmath48 where @xmath49 .",

    "in this section , we show that if the wdw equation admits lie symmetries which form an abelian lie algebra , then the wdw equation is liouville integrable ; that is , the field equations can be solved by quadratures .",
    "a lie symmetry of a differential equation @xmath68 is the generator of the one parameter point transformation which leaves invariant the differential equation @xmath69 .",

    "as we discussed above , the method of using the noether symmetries of the cosmological field equations has been applied by many authors in scalar - field cosmology , in @xmath82 gravity and other modified gravity theories .",
    "recently @xcite , it has been proposed that the cosmological model will be determined by the existence of lie symmetries of the wdw equation of quantum cosmology .",
    "this selection rule is more general than that imposed by the noether symmetries of the field equations , because , as it has been shown in @xcite , the wdw equation is possible to admit lie point symmetries while the lagrangian of the field equations does not admit noether point symmetries . in the following",
    "we discuss the application of lie symmetries in the wdw equation .",
    "specifically , we discuss the reduction process and we show how to construct noetherian conservation laws for a conformally related lagrangian of the field equations from the lie point symmetries of the wdw equation .",
    "the lagrangian of the field equations in minimally coupled scalar field cosmology in  a spatially flat flrw spacetime with a perfect fluid with a constant equation of state parameter @xmath62 is @xmath83 the field equations are the euler - lagrange equations of ( [ lang.01 ] ) with respect to the variables @xmath84 and are equations ( [ frie2 ] ) and ( [ sf.10 ] ) .",
    "as the lagrangian is independent of time , we also have the hamiltonian constraint ( [ sf.07 ] ) , which , in terms of the momenta @xmath85 becomes @xmath86 finally , the field equations are equivalent to the following hamiltonian system:@xmath87@xmath88    the wdw equation is the klein gordon equation which is defined by the conformal laplacian operator .",
    "the general conformal klein gordon equation is:@xmath89 where @xmath90 is the laplacian operator , @xmath91 is the metric of the space and @xmath92 .",
    "we brake the lagrangian ( [ lang.01 ] ) in two parts .",

    "specifically , the minisuperspace is a 2-dimensional lorentz manifold whose coordinates are the scale factor and the scalar field .",
    "the symmetries of this space are related to the lie and the noether symmetries of the dynamical field equations .",
    "the metric of the minisuperspace is defined by the kinematic part of the lagrangian ( [ lang.01 ] ) for the dynamics of the field . the rest of the lagrangian is considered to be the `` effective potential '' of the dynamical system that is defined by the gravitational and scalar fields .",

    "the latter can be seen as the hamilton - jacobi equation of a hamiltonian system moving in the same geometry under the conformal laplace operator of the wdw equation and with the same potential .",
    "specifically , the wdw equation ( [ lang.05 ] ) in scalar field cosmology provides the null hamilton - jacobi equation : @xmath116    furthermore , in @xcite it was also shown that the symmetries of the wdw equation can be used in order to find noether point symmetries for classical particles .",
    "however , the null hamilton - jacobi equation is separable if the @xmath117- dimensional hamiltonian system admits @xmath117 conservation laws @xmath118 ( symmetries ) i.e. @xmath117 corresponding noether symmetries which are independent and in involution , i.e. @xmath119 where @xmath120 denotes the poisson bracket .",
    "if this is the case , then the hamiltonian system is liouville integrable @xcite .",
    "that means that it is possible for the wdw equation to admit an invariant solution and at the same time the classical hamiltonian system to be not integrable .",
    "therefore , in order for the wdw equation to admit an invariant solution and the hamiltonian system to be liouville integrable , the @xmath117- dimensional wdw _",
    "_ equation must admit at least @xmath121 independent lie point symmetries , @xmath122 , which form an abelian lie algebra .",

    "that is , when the field equations are liouville integrable by noether point symmetries then there exists a coordinate system where the wdw equation admits @xmath117 oscillatory terms in the solution and _ vice versa_. it is important to note that this result is more general and includes the one given in @xcite when @xmath127 that is , if one considers the killing algebra of the minisuperspace only .",
    "we conclude that for the reduction / solution of the wdw we may consider directly the lie point symmetries of the wdw equation which are given in terms of the ckvs of the space instead of restricting ourselves to the noether point symmetries only , as has been done in @xcite .",
