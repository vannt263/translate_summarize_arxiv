    "small hydrocarbons and pure carbon chains are formed and they can in turn be the small nuclei from which larger c - rich molecules , such as the poli - aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) can be built .",
    "these molecules are proposed as responsible for the observed emission labeled as unidentified infrared bands ( uibs ) .    in order to draw the clearest picture of the chemical composition , structure and dynamics of crl618 ,",

    "the crl 618 observations presented in this paper are part of a line survey , carried out with the iram-30 m telescope , and complemented with the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cernicharo et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "the iram-30 m telescope has presently the largest effective aperture operating at the 3 , 2 and 1.3 mm atmospheric windows .",
    "the observations started in 1994 and were completed in the winter of 2001 - 02 . in order to avoid confusion between the signal and the image sidebands ,",
    "the receivers were optimized for image sideband rejection larger than 12 db , which resulted in practically no sideband contamination , except for just a few cases where a very intense line ( co , hcn , ... ) was present in the image sideband .",
    "receivers covered the following frequency ranges ( in ghz ) : 82 - 116 , 130 - 184 , 201 - 258 , 240 - 279 .",
    "the pointing and focus were always checked on the target source , since crl618 exhibits a continuum of about 0.3 k in the t@xmath14 scale of the iram-30 m telescope , across the surveyed frequency range ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the pointing was kept within 2  accuracy .",
    "we carried out the observations using the wobbler - switching mode with offsets of 60  and frequencies of 1 hz , in order to obtain very flat baselines .",
    "this is very important because some spectra are so crowded with lines that their reduction could be difficult otherwise ( not enough baseline ) .",
    "the backends used were two 512 mhz filter banks connected to the receivers operating below 200 ghz , and a 512 mhz autocorrelator with channel width of 1.25 mhz connected to the others .",
    "system temperatures were typically 100 - 400 k at 3 mm , 200 - 600 k at 2 mm and 300 - 800 k at 1.3 mm .",
    "the observations performed in several observing runs in 2000 , 2001 and 2002 with the 10.4 meter dish of the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) at the summit of mauna kea ( hawaii ) made use of a helium - cooled sis receiver operating in double - sideband mode in the frequency range 280 - 360 ghz .",
    "the continuum emission from crl618 at the cso has a level of 0.05 - 0.06 k in the t@xmath14 scale , too low to allow pointing on the source .",
    "the pointing was therefore checked on the available planets and was kept within 3 - 4  accuracy ( the hpbw ranged from 20  to 25  ) .",
    "the system temperatures varied from 500 k to 1200 k. in order to obtain flat baselines we used the chopping of the secondary mirror technique at a frequency of about 1 hz and offset of 90  . in order to discriminate whether the lines are from the signal or from the image sideband , the observations were made twice with a frequency shift of a few tens of mhz ( usually 50 ) .",
    "the rotational spectrum of cyanoacetylene , hc@xmath0n , has been investigated in vibrational states up to about 1750 @xmath1 by mbosei et al .",
    "the resulting data base for this molecule has been provided to us by a. fayt . this work has been recently published ( fayt et al . 2004 ) .",
    "the frequencies have been checked against our millimeter wave line survey with a remarkable agreement in the detected vibrational states .",
    "there are three doubly degenerate bending modes of hc@xmath0n , called @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 in order of decreasing energy ( 223 , 499 and 663 @xmath1 ) . when considering the rotation , their degeneracy",
    "is broken due to the direction of the rotation axis .",
    "this is known as @xmath18-doubling .",
    "@xmath19 is the lowest energy stretching mode ( 880.6 @xmath1 ) .",
    "the other 3 vibrational ( stretching ) modes have energies above 2000 @xmath1 and are not seen in crl618 . in this work ,",
    "we have been able to detect hc@xmath0n pure rotational lines in the ground and 14 different vibrationally excited states .",
    "detections have been also obtained in a number of isotopomers , but they will be discussed in a separate work .",
    "the lines are labeled by the rotational quantum numbers ( j@xmath20j@xmath21 ) , the vibrational quantum numbers ( @xmath22,@xmath23,@xmath24,@xmath25 ) and the @xmath18-doubling parameters : [ @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28 ] .",
    "table [ t1 ] provides the observed line parameters ( velocity , width and integrated area ) of a pair of rotational transitions ( j=1211 and j=2625 ) for all detected vibrationally excited states .",
    "the j=1211 lines always display an absorption feature centered at @xmath2 -27.5 kms@xmath3 accompanied by weaker emission ( undetected in some cases ) centered around the lsr velocity of the source . in the j=2625 lines",
    "the absorption is barely detected and the emission is always much stronger .",
    "the selected rotational numbers are representative of the two different types of line profiles observed in hc@xmath0n and in other molecules toward crl618 .",
    "of the complete frequency survey , as described in section [ sct : obs ] , the data set used for the analysis presented in this paper consists of :    * the continuum measured in each setting across the frequency ranges covered : 80 - 116.5 , 132 - 177 and 204 - 276 ghz . * those spectra containing hc@xmath0n rotational lines in a subset of vibrational states , selected to sample the range of the vibrational energies among those detected .",
    "the selected vibrational states are : ( 0000 ) , ( 0001 ) , ( 0002 ) , ( 0010 ) , ( 0100 ) , ( 0003 ) , ( 0011 ) , ( 1000 ) , ( 0012 ) , and ( 0102 ) which vibrational energies are : 0 , 223 , 446 , 499 , 663 , 669 , 722 , 881 , 945 , and 1109 @xmath1 respectively .",
    "the central star has an effective temperature of 30000 k and it is sourrounded by an hii region and its pdr .",
    "continuum emission from the hii region and the dust affect the population of the molecular levels and has to be taken into account in modelling the source .",
    "the properties of the measured continuum will be discussed in this section .",
    "the level of continuum emission is important to explain the features seen in the line profiles of many molecules in crl618 .",
    "although the wobbler - switching method used at the 30 m telescope for this work should provide in principle a precise continuum level for each spectrum directly , the continuum levels of different spectra never match perfectly .",
    "moreover , earlier work has shown evidence of variability over several years ( see below ) .",
    "therefore , we have decided to use all the pointing data to retrieve the continuum by fitting gaussians to the pointing scans and storing the peak of the fitted gaussian ( in t@xmath14 scale ) and the central frequency . the obvious bad scans and",
    "those where the pointing errors were larger than 2  have been ignored .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig1](open circles ) .",
    "t@xmath29 and fluxes have been derived from a linear fit to those data ( actually a horizontal line ) , scaled by the corresponding beam and forward efficiencies of the 30 m telescope . in principle , this analysis could be affected by the presence of lines . however , the total flux from the lines represents less than 3 - 5 % of to the continuum in most frequency settings .",
    "we have just ignored the few frequency settings with very strong lines such as the lowest rotational transitions of co and hcn . in total flux",
    "our measurements give 1.75 jy at 90 ghz , 2.4 jy at 150 ghz and 3.4 jy at 240 ghz .",
    "several continuum measurements of crl618 at different frequencies exist . in an early interferometric mapping carried out at cm wavelengths with the vla",

    "( peak continuum flux : 140 mjy  beam@xmath3 ) . at 1.3 mm ,",
    "walmsley et al . ( 1991 ) found fluxes varying from 1.0 to 3.3 jy between 1987 and 1990 .",
    "if this variability is real , it could explain part of the scattering in the data points presented in figure [ fig1 ] ( obtained over several winters ) .",
    "earlier work ( kwok & feldman 1981 , spergel et al .",
    "1983 ) also present the source as variable at centimeter wavelengths .",
    "other measured fluxes found in the literature include shibata et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , 1.48 jy at 115 ghz , and martn - pintado et al .",
    "( 1998 ) who measured the following at 22.3 , 87.6 , 147.0 and 231.9 ghz : 0.24@xmath310.02 , 1.1@xmath310.1 , 1.8@xmath310.2 , 2.0@xmath310.3 jy , values about 25 - 32 % smaller than our own results ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) that represent an average over at least 4 years .",
    "from the line survey currently under way in the 280 - 360 ghz range , the measured continuum emission averages 0.06 - 0.07 k in the t@xmath14 scale ( @xmath2 0.1 k in t@xmath29 ) .",
    "this result agrees with the trend observed at the higher end of the iram 30 m survey ( 275 ghz ) given the smaller size of the cso antenna ( 10.4 m ) .",
    "the profiles of hc@xmath0n rotational lines within the ground vibrational state ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) show evidence of the high velocity molecular wind ( hvmw ) , also seen in lines of co and other molecules . in hc@xmath0n ,",
    "the hvmw component of the line profile extends some 200 kms@xmath3 in some cases ( see figure [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "in addition to this one , there is another component associated to a slowly expanding molecular envelope around the ultracompact hii region .",
    "this component has a maximum half power width of about 18 kms@xmath3 and is approximately centered at the lsr velocity of crl618 ( -21.3 kms@xmath3 ) .",
    "two different absorption dips are present ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the first one appears at -37 kms@xmath3 in all the lines at least up to j=3736 .",
    "it turns out that this feature is related to the [ 1 0 0]e component of the rotational transitions of the ( 0100 ) state .",
    "the other absorption feature at -55 kms@xmath3 is due to expanding gas in the line of sight of the continuum source and is also found in low - j hcn ( neri et al .",
    "1992 ) and co ( cernicharo et al . 1989 , herpin et al . 2002 ) . on the red side of the line , between approximately -8 and 7 kms@xmath3",
    ", there is evidence of emission that neri et al .",
    "1992 attributed to an unresolved structure located to the north - east of the hii region .",
    "the hc@xmath0n rotational lines in the ( 0001 ) vibrational level , at least below j@xmath20 @xmath2 20 , still trace gas at higher velocities than that seen in rotational lines corresponding to higher energy vibrational levels ( see below ) .",
    "for example , the j=15 - 14 transition in ( 0001 ) shows an absorption dip that clearly starts below -50 kms@xmath3 , more than 30 kms@xmath3 apart from the lsr velocity of the source ( see figure [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "however , for j@xmath20 above 20 this colder and faster outflow is not significant in the level population anymore .      the hc@xmath0n lines in the rest of the detected vibrationally excited states display patterns with many common characteristics .",
    "the lines appear dominantly in emission at 1.3 mm ( at the iram-30 m radiotelescope ) and at shorter wavelengths ( cso observations at 0.850 mm ) with a half power width ranging from 5 to 16 kms@xmath3 , but mostly around 8 - 10 kms@xmath3 . however , the majority of lines in the 2 and 3 mm windows show p - cygni profiles , with the absorption part being systematically deeper at lower frequencies .",
    "this absorption is centered in the range -26 to -31 kms@xmath3 , as expected for an expanding envelope with velocities around 5 - 10 kms@xmath3 surrounding the central continuum source at the lsr velocity of crl618 .",
    "the absorption is less deep and shifts to more negative velocities as the emission part gets stronger with increasing j. at frequencies well below 80 ghz , almost all lines , from other species also , appear strictly in absorption .",
    "the velocity of the absorption feature in hc@xmath0n rotational lines , with j@xmath20 @xmath32 7 , in different vibrationally excited states , observed with the effelsberg 100 m radiotelescope ( wyrowski et al . 2003 ) is around -26 or -27 kms@xmath3 .",
    "thorwirth et al .",
    "2003 also report hcn @xmath33j=0 , @xmath18-doubling transitions purely in absorption at the same velocity , as do martn - pintado et al .",
    "( 1995 ) for nh@xmath0 ( 3,3 ) .",
    "the lowest transitions we have observed ( j=9 - 8 , j=10 - 9 ) in some",
    "highly excited vibrational states such as ( 0100 ) and ( 1000 ) do not show emission and the absorption feature is also centered around -27.5 kms@xmath3 .",
    "in this work we assume that the bulk of vibrationally excited hc@xmath0n emission comes from a compact envelope expanding at about 10 kms@xmath3 around the central continuum source",
    ". the availability of rotational ladders in so many different vibrationally excited hc@xmath0n states should provide a quite precise picture of the size ratio of the slowly expanding gas region with respect to the continuum source , the shape of the envelope , the temperature profile , velocity field and hc@xmath0n density distribution .",
    "all this is explored in sections [ sc : model ] and [ sc : simulations ] .      in order to reproduce the observed rotational hc@xmath0n ladders we have built a model , for lte conditions , of an expanding envelope around a continuum source . because of blending with the selected hc@xmath0n lines for the analysis , we have also introduced hc@xmath34n with an abundance ratio of 1/3 respect to hc@xmath0n ( cernicharo et al .",
    "1987 ; gulin and cernicharo 1991 ) , and isotopic species of hc@xmath0n using a @xmath35c/@xmath36c ratio of 15 .",
    "the lines are formed as follows : first , the central continuum source is responsible for the observed continuum level .",
    "the gas situated between the continuum source and the earth absorbs that continuum and also emits .",
    "the gas in regions outside the line of sight to the continuum source contributes by emission only .",
    "the continuum source is considered opaque to the emission of the gas behind it .",
    "the spectrum of the continuum source and its size ratio with respect to the gas region , turn out to be key parameters to fit the simulations to the observed hc@xmath0n rotational lines .",
    "the absorption takes place primarily at the terminal velocity of the expanding envelope in front of the continuum source .",
    "the emission can help to `` fill '' the absorption dip depending on the characteristics of the velocity field and the turbulence velocity .",
    "the simplest model considers a spherical expanding envelope of gas surrounding a central continuum source ( also spherical ) .",
    "the envelope is divided into different shells where the total hc@xmath0n number density and the temperature vary according to a power law , and radial expansion and turbulent velocities are linearly interpolated between input values at the boundaries .",
    "such a simple model can only approximately reproduce the main observational characteristics of the hc@xmath0n rotational ladders in crl618 .",
    "a more complex model has been developed to account for an elongated envelope with non - radial velocity components .",
    "we consider an external angular size of the ( spherical ) slowly expanding envelope @xmath37 and then we truncate it so that , in the truncation direction , the size is : @xmath38=@xmath39 , @xmath40 being the truncation parameter ( see figure [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "other geometric details of this model are the following : a first coordinate system ( xyz ) is defined with the z axis running in the direction where the sphere is truncated , and x , y are orthogonal to each other and to z. the velocity field will be a function of [ ( x@xmath41+y@xmath41)@xmath42,z ] ( azimuthal symmetry in the xy plane ) , and the temperature and gas densities will only be a function of r=(x@xmath41+y@xmath41+z@xmath41)@xmath42 ( radial symmetry ) .",
    "the second coordinate system has the axis x in common with x just described , and the remaining two ( y,z ) are rotated respect to ( y , z ) by an angle @xmath43 so that z points to the earth ( line of sight )",
    ". the `` edge - on '' case therefore corresponds to i=90@xmath44 .",
    "the continuum source is spherical with an angular radius @xmath45 .",
    "the value of @xmath45 has to be in the range 0.15-0.4  in order to be compatible with data presented in section [ sectcont ] .",
    "we use as input parameter its ratio @xmath46 respect to the external angular size of the slowly expanding envelope , @xmath46=@xmath45/@xmath37 .",
    "the effective temperature of the continuum source would depend on that size in order to match the observed continuum .",
    "in general , the equivalent size @xmath45 would be a function of frequency .",
    "however , a constant size and a frequency dependent @xmath47 , characterized by a spectral index @xmath48 ( see following equation ) , fit the data very nicely ( see figure [ fig1 ] and table [ tablecont ] ) .",
    "@xmath49^{s}{\\rm , }   \\label{tcont}\\ ] ]    in the elongated envelope case , the velocity field can not be exactly radial : @xmath50 ( @xmath51 if r@xmath521 ) .",
    "the extra velocity component in the xy plane makes the velocity pattern look as in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "this kind of velocity field has the advantage of having gas with the same velocity projection in regions in and out the column between the continuum source and the earth .",
    "some extra gas is thus allowed to contribute filling the absorption dip ( not only the turbulence velocity helps to do this , see figure [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "the velocity field remains unchanged by rotation respect to the y or z axis .",
    "therefore , in the @xmath43=0@xmath44,90@xmath44 cases ( `` edge - on '' or `` orthogonal '' envelope cases ) , only the radiative transfer results as a function of the impact parameter @xmath53 ( defined as an angle ) have to be used in the numerical convolution with the antenna beam pattern .",
    "if @xmath43 takes any intermediate value , the numerical integration becomes dramatically more time consuming ( 10 - 100 times ) because the azimuthal symmetry respect to the xy plane is broken and the convolution has to be performed in both @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( azimuthal angle around the z or line - of - sight axis , see figure [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "as we have seen , the model has an important number of parameters .",
    "some of them can be fixed with some confidence , based on data such as the continuum flux ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) and the estimated distance to the source .",
    "the other parameters , velocity field , kinetic temperature , shape of the slowly expanding envelope , ratio between its size and that of the continuum source , and hc@xmath0n column density , can be constrained by running a number of models .",
    "it is quite straightforward to find the best values for all parameters , with the exception of the kinetic temperature and hc@xmath0n column density .",
    "this is discussed below .",
    "the first step in the simulation process has concentrated on the continuum source .",
    "we have considered different sizes for it ( constant with frequency ) and we have calculated its effective temperature at a reference frequency ( 200 ghz ) and the spectral index , @xmath48 , to match the observed continuum ( figure [ fig1 ] ) . based on the references given in section [ sectcont ] ,",
    "the range of sizes we have explored is 0.15  to 0.40  .",
    "the results are given in table [ tablecont ] .",
    "for each set of values , the fit to our continuum data is very good , typically as shown on figure [ fig1 ] . as the external size of the gas region we are modeling is around 1.5  and",
    "the ratio of this size to the continuum source size is a key parameter for reproducing the observed line profiles , the preferred values among the five given alternatives are highlighted in bold face .    as the number of physical parameters and lines observed",
    "are both large , a general numerical fit to constrain all physical parameters simultaneously is not possible .",
    "rather , it is necessary to run a large number of models in several steps in order to find a reasonable match to all the observed hc@xmath0n rotational ladders .",
    "as this is very time consuming , the simulations have been restricted to the ( 0002 ) , ( 0010 ) , ( 0100 ) , ( 0003 ) , ( 0011 ) , ( 1000 ) , ( 0012 ) , and ( 0102 ) vibrational states , as explained in section [ sct : results ] .    in the search for the best solution we also need to define a parameter to evaluate the quality of the fit . ideally , this parameter has to give equal weight to the different lines , independently of the frequency resolution .",
    "we thus defined an overall @xmath55 as follows :    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is the number of suitable lines in figure [ fig6 ] , @xmath58 are the data ( total flux divided by the contiuum flux ) , @xmath59 are the model results , @xmath60 is the number of channels where @xmath61 , i.e. we do not consider channels where the signal is just the continuum level , or lines from species other that hc@xmath12n or hc@xmath62n .",
    "in addition , if a line from other chemical species overlaps with those from hc@xmath12n or hc@xmath62n , the corresponding spectrum is discarded .",
    "note also that in figure [ fig6 ] not all the @xmath18-type lines are shown in each case due to the sometimes large velocity separation .",
    "only the data shown in the figure are used to calculate @xmath55 .",
    "blending between different vibrational states or within the same vibrational state has been treated in our simulations .",
    "the two parameters that we have tried to determine by looking at @xmath55 in a grid of models are the temperature of the gas and the hc@xmath12n column density . in order to illustrate how the best solution ( [ fig6 ] ) is found we show in figure [ fig7 ] the values of parameter @xmath55 as a function of these two parameters .",
    "the overall set of parameters characterizing the slowly expanding molecular envelope is then shown on table [ table2 ] .",
    "the kinetic temperature found here ( 250 - 275 k ) is in very good agreement with the value derived from iso ir data by cernicharo et al .",
    "2001a , b . the average column density of absorbing hc@xmath0n in front of the continuum source is found to be in the range 2.0 - 3.5@xmath410@xmath5 @xmath6 .",
    "hc@xmath0n column densities in front of the continuum source where determined to be 5@xmath410@xmath63 @xmath6 by cernicharo et al .",
    "( 2001a ) from iso observations of hc@xmath0n ( 0100 ) and ( 0001 ) bending modes in absorption around 14 @xmath64 m .",
    "the difference between both estimates could be related to two facts : first , the iso data lacks the spectral resolution needed to fully resolve the individual lines used for the estimate .",
    "second , cernicharo et al .",
