    "<S> we report on the results from _ suzaku _ x - ray observations of the radio complex region called kookaburra , which includes two adjacent tev @xmath0-ray sources hess  j1418 - 609 and hess  j1420 - 607 . </S>",
    "<S> the _ suzaku _ </S>",
    "<S> observation revealed x - ray diffuse emission around a middle - aged pulsar psr  j1420 - 6048 and a plausible pwn rabbit with elongated sizes of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the peaks of the diffuse x - ray emission are located within the @xmath0-ray excess maps obtained by h.e.s.s . and </S>",
    "<S> the offsets from the @xmath0-ray peaks are @xmath3 for psr  j1420 - 6048 and @xmath4 for rabbit . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray spectra of the two sources were well reproduced by absorbed power - law models with @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral shapes tend to become softer according to the distance from the x - ray peaks . assuming the one zone electron emission model as the first order approximation </S>",
    "<S> , the ambient magnetic field strengths of hess  j1420 - 607 and hess  j1418 - 609 can be estimated as 3  @xmath6 g , and @xmath7 g , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray spectral and spatial properties strongly support that both tev sources are pulsar wind nebulae , in which electrons and positrons accelerated at termination shocks of the pulsar winds are losing their energies via the synchrotron radiation and inverse compton scattering as they are transported outward . </S>"
