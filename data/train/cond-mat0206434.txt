    "the evaluation of effective properties for two  dimensional ( 2d ) two  component composites , which determine the behavior of the medium at large scales , given rise by keller @xcite and dykhne @xcite , remains a topic of high activity . among different approaches ( variational bounds @xcite ; asymptotic @xcite ; numerical @xcite ; network analogue @xcite ) used to consider this problem , the analytical approach , being classical problem of mathematical physics , is surprisingly very difficult",
    ". exact values of effective parameters are of great interest even though these values are established in idealized models .",
    "it seems that explicit formulae are available only as exceptions .",
    "such formulae which solve the field equations were obtained for two  component regular checkerboard with square @xcite , rectangular @xcite and triangular @xcite unit cell using complex  variables analysis . another technique ( integral equations )",
    "was used in the recent papers dealt with square @xcite and triangular @xcite regular checkerboard .",
    "almost all these studies were directed towards effective conductivity @xmath3 evaluation despite of important fact that the heterogeneity contributed to the conducting composite some dielectric properties .",
    "the homogeneous metal does not possess static dielectric properties ( such as electric susceptibility ) because only core electrons can contribute there , but their influence is obviously small .",
    "however , heterogeneity leads to the extra charge concentration at the boundaries of different phases , which results essentially nonzero effective electric susceptibility @xmath4 .",
    "the implication follows that the relation between the conductivity @xmath1 and susceptibility @xmath0 effective tensors must exist .    in the present paper",
    "we will consider the regular 2d two  component rhombic checkerboard and derive such relation .",
    "this middle ",
    "symmetric structure belongs to @xmath5plane group @xcite and gives rise to anisotropy of @xmath1 . in some sense",
    "this anisotropic model is more universal than the regular 2d two  component rectangular checkerboard ( @xmath6plane group ) .",
    "really , the effective electric properties are mostly determined by the corner points of the cell , where the electric field is singular @xcite .",
    "the structure of composite near these points in rhombic checkerboard is governed by _",
    "arbitrary _ angular variable .",
    "the regular checkerboard structure is composed of rhombic conducting cells with isotropic homogeneous conductivities @xmath7 and @xmath8 , hereafter @xmath9 . the backbone of such structure can be represented as the set of images of the letter `` x '' with infinitely long legs , which are shifted up and down to distance @xmath10 , @xmath11 ; @xmath12 is the smallest angle between legs ( see figure [ rom1 ] ) .",
    "the side of the cell is scaled by unit length . such arrangement of the checkerboard allows to generate the kernel for the integral equation by single series summation rather than by double summation @xcite .",
    "we will consider the external unit field @xmath13 be applied in vertical direction @xmath14 .",
    "it is one of the principal axes of the effective material tensors .",
    "another axis @xmath15 may be considered just changing @xmath16 .",
    "let us proceed with solution of laplace equation for a scalar potential @xmath17 at the infinite plane @xmath18 @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the two - dimensional green function and @xmath21 is a charge distribution at the plane .",
    "the boundary conditions at the edge relate normal components of the field @xmath22 and of the current density @xmath23 @xmath24 where a new variable @xmath25 is introduced to measure the distance along the edge of a unit cell counted from the cell corner and @xmath26 hereafter is the charge distribution at the edge . the boundary conditions ( [ int3 ] ) allow to write master equation @xmath27 finding the corresponding derivatives @xmath28 ( see appendix [ appendix1 ] ) we come to the integral equation @xmath29 where a new function @xmath30 reflects a periodic interchange of the constituents ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) with variation of argument @xmath25 @xmath31\\;,\\;\\;g(-t)=-g(t)\\;;\\;\\;g(t)=-1\\;\\;\\;\\mbox{for}\\;\\;\\ ; 0 < t\\leq 1\\ ; , \\label{int7c}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the function @xmath32 gives the remainder on division of @xmath25 by 2 and @xmath33 $ ] gives -1 , 0 or 1 depending on whether @xmath34 is negative , zero , or positive .",
    "the kernel @xmath35 is given by formula @xmath36 \\label{int7a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is worth to represent the kernel for further summation as @xmath37\\;,\\label{int7b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the zeros @xmath38 and @xmath39 of both denominators in ( [ int7a ] ) read @xmath40 making use of identity @xmath41 we can evaluate ( [ int7b ] ) in the sense of principal value and reduce essentially the kernel of integral equation ( [ int7 ] ) @xmath42 the further simplification of the kernel @xmath35 can be continued by usage of trigonometry . introducing @xmath43",
    "we obtain finally the integral equation @xmath44 where @xmath45 the function @xmath46 being a solution of integral equation ( [ int12 ] ) makes it possible to find an exact expression of the effective conductivity tensor @xmath1 ( see section [ suscept ] ) .",
    "we start this section with two algebraic properties of the function @xmath46 , which will be used in order to simplify further calculation .",
    "these are the parity and periodicity of the functions @xmath47 , @xmath46 , which are following from ( [ int12 ] ) @xmath48 they are in full agreement with physics of the charge distribution @xmath46 along the edges of the cells .",
    "a proof follows from an accurate evaluation of integral in ( [ int12 ] ) .",
    "indeed , the parity property follows due to ( [ int7c ] ) and identity @xmath49 @xmath50 the periodicity could be proven in the similar way .",
    "a similar integral equation was appeared in ref .",
    "for the two  component checkerboard with square unit cell .",
    "its solution is presented by the means of weierstrass elliptic function @xmath51 , where @xmath52 , and is found by inspection its behavior near the branch points @xmath53 and @xmath54 @xmath55 the equality of the exponents @xmath56 is here essential .",
    "already the two  component checkerboard with triangle unit cell @xcite breaks the validity of ( [ int13 ] ) , that made unattainable an explicit solution , but only an efficient approximate method was proposed .",
    "the rhombic structure , discussed in the present paper , also gives rise to distinct exponents .",
    "asymptotic behavior of @xmath46 near the branch points @xmath53 and @xmath54 can be found from the equation ( [ int12 ] ) ( see appendix [ appendix1 ] ) @xmath57\\;,\\label{int14}\\\\ e_n^{(i)}(t)\\sim \\rho(t)\\stackrel{t\\rightarrow 1 } \\sim   ( 1-t)^{2\\mu_1}\\;&,&\\ ; \\sin \\pi \\mu_1= z\\sin\\left[\\alpha+\\mu_1\\left(2\\alpha-\\pi\\right)\\right]\\;. \\label{int15}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then @xmath58 and for a large contrast in conductivities @xmath59 : @xmath60 .",
    "this shows that the generic rhombic cell ( @xmath61 ) does not lead to the solution of ( [ int12 ] ) , which can be built out by simple rescaling of weierstrass elliptic functions .",
    "an explicit solution of integral equation remains to be performed .",
    "it turns out that the integral equation ( [ int12 ] ) , obtained in the present section , is sufficient to establish an exact relation between effective electric conductivity @xmath1 and effective electric susceptibility @xmath0 , which was not to our knowledge discussed earlier .",
    "let us consider the polarization of the rhombic checkerboard at the scales large , compared to the size of the cells .",
    "the effective electric susceptibility is the tensor which defined by @xmath62 where @xmath63 is polarization and @xmath64 is external electric field .",
    "in the reference frame ( figure [ rom1 ] ) , when @xmath0 is diagonalized , its @xmath65component is determined by induced dipole moment @xmath66 per unit square : @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is dipole moment of area @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the sizes of a sample .",
    "the summation covers all induced edge ",
    "charges @xmath71 which are placed within the area @xmath18 .",
    "the sample which is composed of @xmath72 unit cells has the area @xmath73 .",
    "the formula ( [ int17 ] ) can be reduced making use of parity and periodicity properties ( [ int12a ] ) of @xmath46 .",
    "its accurate evaluation reads @xmath74 taking into account the inparity ( [ int7c ] ) of the function @xmath30 we obtain finally @xmath75 we define also the effective conductivity @xmath3 as a ratio of the current @xmath76 through the @xmath34cross - section of the checkerboard per the unit length to the applied field @xmath77 @xmath78 due to keller @xcite the principal values of the tensor @xmath1 satisfy the duality relations @xmath79 relating now two physical quantities ( [ int18 ] ) , ( [ int5 ] ) , we make use of auxiliary integral equation , obtained by integrating the equation ( [ int12 ] ) ( see appendix [ appendix2 ] ) @xmath80 the last relation could be rewritten in new notations ( [ int18 ] ) , ( [ int5 ] ) @xmath81 one can think that @xmath7 , which appeared in ( [ int20 ] ) , breaks the universality of the formulae .",
    "actually , the denominator contains the maximal value of partial conductivities @xmath82 .",
    "in fact , we have established the tensorial relation in any reference frame @xmath83 where @xmath84 is an identity matrix .",
    "formula ( [ int20a ] ) results in the particular square ",
    "checkerboard case : @xmath85 .",
    "let us consider now two different cases of the weak and large contrast in partial conductivities .",
    "@xmath86 , or @xmath87 :    in the first order on @xmath88 the integral equation ( [ int12 ] ) gives according to definition ( [ int5 ] ) @xmath89 and therefore @xmath90    \\2 .",
    "@xmath91 :    in this limit the corner points @xmath92 of the cell become important .",
    "making use of the distribution ( [ int14 ] ) for the fields and charge @xmath93 one can find approximately in leading terms @xmath94 actually , the coefficient was found in @xcite : @xmath95 .",
    "formula ( [ int22 ] ) implies as well @xmath96",
    "\\1 . we have derived the integral equation for the effective conductivity problem for the regular 2d two  component rhombic checkerboard .",
    "an asymptotic behavior of the electric field was investigated near the singular points @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the heterogeneity of composite leads to the extra charge concentration at the boundaries of different phases that results essentially nonzero effective electric susceptibility .",
    "the exact relation ( [ int20a ] ) between the two most important electrical properties , namely , effective conductivity @xmath1 and effective susceptibility @xmath0 , of rhombic composite was established .",
    "an absence of specific angular parameter @xmath12 in this formula make us possible to conjecture its validity for any anisotropic two  component structure .",
    "it is shown that the tensor of electrical susceptibility has surprisingly simple structure in both cases of large and small contrast in partial conductivities @xmath2 .",
    "the relation derived in present paper is definitely valid for cylindrical samples .",
