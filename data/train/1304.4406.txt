    "most people live in cities @xcite and the largest part of current greenhouse gas ( ghg ) emissions is associated with urban areas @xcite . however , a characterization of the metropolis as dirty and polluting may be misleading considering the finding that various positive features , such as innovation or economic activity , are more effective in large cities ( we always refer to population when we speak about the size of a city ) compared to smaller ones @xcite .",
    "accordingly , it is relevant how city size and co@xmath0 emissions are related , i.e.  to which extent a similar scaling or allometric effect can be identified .",
    "the outcome could shed light on the question of how sustainable urban life is @xcite .    while dodman @xcite argues that per capita emissions from cities are lower than the corresponding country value , hoornweg et al .",
    "@xcite find that emissions on different scales vary considerably for the same resident , depending on whether production- or consumption - based figures are considered .",
    "brown et al .",
    "@xcite conclude that metropolitan areas can have a large impact towards a climate - friendly environment .",
    "usually , proportionality between city size and city emissions is assumed , i.e.  the more inhabitants , the more co@xmath0 is emitted .",
    "however , this assumption has neither been verified nor disproved empirically , which is mostly due to the lack of comparable emission values on the city scale . in case",
    "the linearity holds it could be used to more accurately estimate emissions of cities for which no data is available .",
    "currently , linearity is assumed for downscaling emissions from a country to high resolution raster scale , e.g.  @xcite . in case",
    "the correlations between population and emissions are non - linear , the question arises which form they take and which factors determine their shape  the influence of a country s development stage is particularly interesting .",
    "a proposal for a principal standard for urban emission inventories has recently been suggested by c40 cities climate leadership group and iclei local governments for sustainability in collaboration with world resources institute , world bank , unep , and un - habitat @xcite .",
    "however , for currently existing inventories a multitude of methodologies have been and are still in use .",
    "it ranges widely in terms of the area , sector or emission(s ) of interest , the precision of the methodologies applied , and in how far the inventories followed the methodology and traceably documented the input , methods , and findings in the published results .",
    "the literature and its urban emissions figures considered for this study reflect this heterogeneity , which could be a source of dispersion . since the standard procedure of emission reporting as described in the ipcc guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories @xcite , an analogous decompdecomposition into emissions from cities could aid in assessing their sustainability ,",
    "i.e.  a _ reporting scheme for cities _ is desirable ( measurable , reportable , verifiable ) .",
    "we investigate co@xmath0 emissions versus the city size of 256 large cities situated in 33 different countries .",
    "we relate the two quantities employing a power - law with the exponent  @xmath4 to characterize whether the emissions depend linearly , super- or sub - linearly on the city size , i.e.  whether large cities emit more co@xmath0 per capita than small cities , or vice versa . a priori",
    ", the scaling could be different for the various countries we investigate .",
    "therefore we examine the influence of economic development and study how the exponent of the power - law relates to the countries per capita gross domestic product ( gdp ) in purchasing power parity ( ppp ) values ( we always refer to gdp(ppp ) and omit `` ppp '' from now on ) .",
    "finally , we derive how the total emissions of a country depend on the size of the largest city .",
    "we show that a transition occurs from super- to sub - linear behavior at approximately 10,000 $ gdp / cap ( @xmath5 ) , where the domination of the largest city is overcome .",

    "we begin our analysis by plotting the annual amount of co@xmath0 emission @xmath13 ( we always refer to _ annual _ figures and omit `` annual '' for simplicity ) against the corresponding city population @xmath14 . dividing by the per capita emissions of the corresponding countries we make the city emissions of different countries comparable . in fig .",

    "notwithstanding the large error - bars , the results indicate that there is a difference in scaling between developing and developed countries , i.e.  cities in ( economically ) developing countries tend to a super - linear relation between population and co@xmath0 emissions ( @xmath18 ) , while cities of ( economically ) developed countries tend to a sub - linear relation ( @xmath17 ) .",

    "relating emissions from cities to the emissions from an entire country could help to understand the drivers of emissions . estimating the emissions of an entire country with the aforementioned relationship between city size and emissions requires taking into account how many cities exist for each size .",

    "the six elements water availability , nutrition , energy supply , housing / shelter , sanitation and social cohesion were found to be significantly related to co@xmath0 emissions , while the others were only loosely coupled to co@xmath0 emissions @xcite .",
    "emissions are determined by a combination of advancement of technology and level of consumption .",
    "thus , people in developed countries cause more emissions  despite advanced technology  simply due to their increased consumption of all kinds of resources and services .    per capita emissions",
    "are much higher in developed countries and adjusting for emissions embodied in international trade further increases this discrepancy @xcite .",
    "davis & caldeira @xcite pointed out that due to international trade the production - based accounting of emissions may not be very helpful .",
    "instead they proposed to consider consumption - based inventories where the co@xmath0 emissions for the production of a good is accounted to the country where the good is consumed .",
    "it would be interesting to see how co@xmath0 emissions and city size relate considering consumption - based emissions .",
    "a study focusing on household energy use across and within approximately 50 metropolitan areas in the us ( a pronounced net importer of co@xmath0 emissions ) showed that the spatial distribution of the population was an important determinant of per - household emission levels @xcite . across metropolitan areas per capita emissions",
    "were negatively associated with city population , which is principally in line with our findings .",
    "their findings underline how urban development and transportation can significantly impact emissions and provide entry points for understanding the super- and sub - linear correlations found in our study .",

    "@xcite point out a population scaling effect for ghg emissions and urban population ( larger cities may be less efficient than smaller ones ) . using a top - down method driven by global emissions and population datasets ,",
    "they differentiate the spatial distribution of urban emissions worldwide by sectors , regions and country level of development .",
    "minx et al .",
    "@xcite study the 434 municipalities in the uk and find that the consumption - based co@xmath0-emissions are mainly determined by socio - economic factors , increasing with income , education , and car ownership but decreases with household size .",
    "applying aspects of such approaches for inquiry into explanations for both super- and sub - linear behavior shows promising properties for regional and global studies .",
    "we do not know the reasons for the suggested _ @xmath4-transition _ but the underlying processes seem to depend on the development of the considered country",
    ". a possible explanation could be the allocation of facilities @xcite .",
    "@xcite find that commercial facilities exhibit linear and public ones sub - linear scaling with population . if it is assumed that facility types differ in emissions and that public sector development varies , then different emissions scaling can be expected depending on country development .",
    "another explanation could be a different structures of city economies in the light of shifts from industry to services , which has been discussed as an important mechanism of carbon reduction due to modernization @xcite .",
    "such differences in the structure and change of the economies depend on the degree of development  at least they are evident on the scale of countries @xcite . for a further discussion , we refer to @xcite .",
    "in addition to lifestyles and economic composition , the geographical city size can have positive or negative effects in terms of co@xmath0 emissions . on the one hand ,",
    "the compactness of cities implies shorter distances and less emissions from transport .",
    "since generally the ( public ) transport system is better established in developed countries , emissions in cities can depend on the development of the corresponding country .",
    "moreover , an inverse relationship between compactness and co2 emissions has been reported for japan , the usa , and china , suggesting that compact cities emit less co@xmath0 @xcite .    on the other hand , super- or sub - linear scaling",
    "could be related to the urban heat island effect which is more pronounced in large cities but might depend on the climate where they are located @xcite , which in turn can affect the heating and cooling behavior of people , see e.g.  @xcite .    unfortunately , we can only provide poor evidence of a development dependent @xmath4 .",
    "the analyzed figures have been collected by various authors and can not exclude differences in the technical details of the inventories , and in rigor with which the varying methodologies were abided by and reported .",
    "this shows how the available data on city emissions is still insufficient and we urge for a systematic and comparable reporting of co@xmath0 emissions from cities , for example as recently proposed @xcite .",
    "we plan to verify our results in future research based on updated city inventories as they become available .",
    "the same holds for alternative data sources , such as the high resolution fossil fuel combustion co@xmath0 emissions fluxes for the us @xcite or data from the greenhouse gases observing satellite ( gosat ) @xcite and local detailed ghg monitoring programmes , e.g. @xcite .",
    "we thank a.  nockert and s.  huber for help with the data as well as n.  schwarz and x.  gabaix for useful comments .",
