    "kagra ( previously called lcgt for large - scale cryogenic gravitational - wave telescope ) is a japanese 3-km optical interferometer currently under construction in the kamioka mine .",
    "the aim of the detector is frequent observation of gravitational waves from faraway galaxies and to obtain unique information on the universe .",
    "the observation will be performed with other detectors in the us ( advanced ligo  @xcite ) and europe ( advanced virgo  @xcite and geo - hf  @xcite ) , which are now being upgraded after several - year observations in the initial configurations .",
    "kagra and the other three detectors are called second - generation gravitational - wave detectors .",
    "there are two unique features in the detector configuration of kagra .",
    "one is that the entire detector is constructed in the underground .",
    "both seismic noise and gravity gradient noise are low in the underground .",
    "in addition , the low rms motion relaxes the requirement on the interferometer control and reduces electro - magnetic noise .",
    "the other special feature is the cryogenic operation of the interferometer .",
    "the sapphire test masses are cooled down to 20  k and mirror thermal noise is lower than that of room - temperature detectors .",
    "another benefit of the cryogenic operation is that the mirror causes almost no thermal lensing effect , which is one of the biggest issues for the room - temperature detectors , for the high thermal conductivity of sapphire at 20  k.    the unique features of kagra come along with unique issues .",
    "the baseline length is limited by the size of the mountain .",
    "the floor is tilted for the water drainage system .",
    "the mirror is made of sapphire instead of classic fused silica .",
    "the laser power is limited by the amount of the absorbed heat that can be extracted through the suspension fibers .",
    "the detector configuration of kagra is designed with these issues fully considered",
    ". some of our knowledge of the underground cryogenic interferometer will be useful for a third - generation gravitational - wave detector , einstein telescope  @xcite for example , which is planned to be built underground and operated in a cryogenic temperature .",
    "figure  [ fig : ifo ] shows the schematic view of the kagra detector . the optical configuration is a michelson interferometer with the high - finesse arm cavities and the folded recycling cavities .",
    "the signal recycling cavity reduces the storage time of the signal fields resonating in the arm cavities in order to retain a broad bandwidth ; this system is called resonant - sideband extraction ( rse )  @xcite .",
    "the four test - mass mirrors in the arm cavities are cooled down to 20  k to reduce thermal fluctuations .",
    "these mirrors are made of sapphire and suspended by sapphire fibers .",
    "the mass of the sapphire mirrors ranges between @xmath1  kg , depending on the availability .",
    "the laser power after the mode - cleaner ranges between @xmath2  w , depending on the absorption of the sapphire mirror ; the less absorption , the more power we can inject .",
    "the power recycling gain is about 10 and the finesse of the arm cavity is 1550 .",
    "the power reflectivity of the signal recycling mirror is 85  % and the resonant condition of the signal recycling cavity is detuned by @xmath3  deg to increase the detector sensitivity to the gravitational waves from the neutron - star binaries ( the major parameters are listed in [ appa ] ) .",
    "our primary target source is the neutron - star binaries since the event rate can be well estimated and the waveform during the inspiral is predictable . in the end , the observable distance of the neutron - star binary inspirals with kagra ranges between @xmath4  mpc , with which we will be able to detect @xmath5 neutron - star binary signals per year  @xcite@xcite@xcite . here",
    "the normal incidence of the wave is assumed in the calculation of inspiral range .",
    "kagra project was approved by the japanese government in 2010 .",
    "the initial phase will be the room - temperature operation without the recycling cavities .",
    "this is called initial kagra or ikagra .",
    "a short - term observation of ikagra is planned in 2015 .",
    "the test masses of ikagra are 10  kg silica mirrors provided by courtesy of ligo . in the second phase ,",
    "the test masses are replaced by the 23  kg ( or 30  kg ) sapphire mirrors to be cooled down . the suspension system is upgraded and the recycling mirrors are introduced .",
    "this is the baseline - design kagra or bkagra .",
    "observations with bkagra will start in @xmath6 .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectrum ] shows the estimated noise budget of kagra  @xcite .",
    "hereafter we assume the safest parameter set , namely the 23  kg mass and the 50  w laser .",
    "the sensitivity is limited by quantum noise at most frequencies , and also suspension thermal noise is close to limit the sensitivity at low frequencies ( @xmath7  hz ) .",
    "this reflects quite well the characteristic of the detector .",
    "while mirror thermal noise is low for the cryogenic operation , shot noise is higher than other advanced detectors due to the low laser power for the cryogenic operation .",
    "the lighter mass increases quantum radiation pressure noise and suspension thermal noise .",
    "the fiber thickness is not determined by its strength but by the amount of the heat transferred from the test mass to the upper stages that are connected to the cryo - cooler .",
    "the thick fiber increases suspension thermal noise .",
    "the peak of suspension thermal noise at 130  hz is the vertical - mode resonance and the peaks starting at 230  hz are the violin modes .",
    "the peak at 16  hz is the vertical resonance of the wire suspending the recoil mass .",
    "we discuss more in detail about each noise curve in the following sections .",
    "seismic noise and gravity gradient noise ( ggn ) are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : seismic ] , thermal noise is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : thermal ] , and quantum noise is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : qn ] .",
    "on the left side of fig .",
    "[ fig : vis ] are shown the schematic views of type - a and type - b suspensions .",
    "the type - a is a 2-story suspension with short and steady inverted pendula on the top floor , 4 geometric anti - spring ( gas ) filters in the middle , and the triple pendulum at the bottom for the cryogenic test masses .",
    "the type - b is for the beamsplitter and the recycling mirrors . while the type - a suspension system has more gas filters and the isolation ratio is better than type - b at low frequencies , vibrations of the cryo - cooler transferred through the heat link limit the noise performance above a few hz . in the end",
    "the noise levels of type - a and type - b are nearly equal in the observation band .",
    "the seismic motion of the kagra site in the kamioka mine is @xmath8 times lower than that of the tama site at @xmath9  hz  @xcite . the temperature and the humidity fluctuations measured in the mine are 0.01  deg per day and 0.08  % per day , respectively  @xcite .    on the right side of fig .",
    "[ fig : vis ] are shown the seismic noise spectra with the type - a and type - b suspensions together with the ggn spectra , which were simulated by courtesy of jan harms at caltech using seismic data of the kamioka region provided by a research group in nikhef  @xcite .",
    "the test masses are located at least 200  m away from the surface of the mountain .",
    "it is an advantage of the underground observatory that ggn from the surface of the mountain is suppressed .",
    "figure  [ fig : cryostat ] shows the schematic view of the cryogenic system that contains a sapphire test mass suspended by sapphire fibers in the cryostat vacuum chamber .",
    "the outer / inner radiation shield is connected to the 1st - stage/2nd - stage of the cryo - cooler through the pure - metal heat path and cooled down to 80  k/8  k. the two stages are connected to the pulse - tube cryo - cooler ( ptc ) through the flexible heat links and the ptc is on the vibration reduction stage  @xcite .",
    "the last 3 stages of the suspension system are inside the radiation shields .",
    "the platform is connected to the inner shield through the 7 pure aluminum heat links of 1  mm diameter , and the intermediate mass suspended under the platform is connected to the platform through the 5 heat links of 3  mm diameter .",
    "the heat absorbed in the test mass is transferred to the intermediate mass through the suspension fiber and then transferred to the upper stages through the heat links .    the transferable heat from an object at temperature @xmath10 to an object at temperature @xmath11 is given by the following equation : @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are diameter , length , number , and thermal conductivity of the fiber or the heat link , respectively .",
    "the thermal conductivity depends on the fiber diameter due to the surface scattering and also depends highly on the temperature .",
    "while the thermal conductivity can be calculated using the debye model  @xcite , we use the following simple equation that is derived from measurement results and is good below @xmath17  k : @xmath18  ( w / m / k ) .        with the full laser power injected , about 800  w light transmits through the input test mass ( itm ) and 400  kw light is stored in the cavity .",
    "the absorption of the sapphire substrate ranges between @xmath19  ppm / cm in a recent measurement  @xcite .",
    "the absorption of the silica / tantala doublet coatings measured at 20  k is @xmath20  ppm  @xcite . to be on a safer side",
    ", we assume 50  ppm / cm for the substrate and 1.0  ppm for the coatings . there is additional 200  mw heat introduced through the radiation from the apertures and the view ports . in total ,",
    "about 1.2  w heat is absorbed by the test mass with the full power .",
    "there are point - like defects on the mirror surface and about 10  ppm of the light in the cavity is scattered around to contribute to increase the temperature of the inner radiation shield .",
    "the inner shield is coated with the diamond - like carbon ( dlc ) to reduce time to cool down the test masses before the operation .",
    "the absorptivity of the 1.0  @xmath21 dlc coating on the cp aluminum at 10  @xmath21 is as high as 0.41 , so that the mirror can be cooled faster with the radiation from the mirror to the inner shield  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the scattered light is also absorbed by the inner shield more effectively .",
    "most of the scattered light , about @xmath22  w , is absorbed and the heat can increase the temperature of the inner shield to @xmath23  k. all of these facts taken into account , the test mass temperature would become 23  k with the full laser power .    as is shown in the left panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : tn ] , mirror thermal noise , especially substrate thermoelastic noise , increases with the mirror temperature . the inspiral range of the neutron - star binary with the full - power operation decreases from 250  mpc to 230  mpc when the mirror temperature increases from 20  k to 23  k. it is then rather better to decrease the laser power . the mirror temperature can be 20  k with about 60  % of the laser power . shot noise increases and thermal noise decreases .",
    "the inspiral range is then 240  mpc .",
    "an alternative solution for the increasing heat absorption would be to use thicker fibers . replacing the 1.6  mm fiber by a 2.0  mm fiber , we could retain the mirror temperature of 20  k with the full laser power injected in return to an increase of suspension thermal noise",
    ". the inspiral range would be then slightly higher , but this strategy takes away the possibility of the sensitivity improvement in the case the absorption be lower than the estimate .      the mirror thermal noise curve in fig .  [ fig : spectrum ] is the sum of substrate brownian noise , coating brownian noise , and substrate thermoelastic noise .",
    "coating thermo - optic noise is supposedly low at 20  k and is ignored here .",
    "the substrate brownian noise and coating brownian noise levels for each mirror are given by  @xcite@xcite @xmath24 respectively .",
    "here @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 are the boltzmann constant , mirror temperature , frequency , coating thickness , beam radius , poisson ratio , young s modulus , and mechanical loss angle , respectively , with the subscript @xmath33 indicating substrate for @xmath34 and coatings for @xmath35 . as for the coatings ,",
    "the total thermal noise level is a sum of the noise level for silica layers and the noise level for tantala layers .",
    ".the last fractions in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : tn1 ] ) and ( [ eq : tn2 ] ) that consist of young s modulus and poisson ratio ( in the unit of 1/pa ) .",
    "the sapphire substrate has an advantage that these coefficients are low . [",
