    "realistic nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) potentials , such as the argonne v18 @xcite , the bonn cd potential @xcite , or potentials from chiral perturbation theory @xcite , describe experimental two - nucleon data with high accuracy .",

    ", one often applies transformation techniques , such as the unitary correlation operator method ( ucom ) @xcite or the similarity renormalization group ( srg ) @xcite that maintain the phase shifts of the original interaction .",
    "consequently , there exists a series of effective realistic interactions , which all succeed in describing two - nucleon data with the same precision but differ in their momentum - dependence and off - shell behavior .",
    "they also lead to different induced three- and many - body interactions .",
    "many of these effective realistic nn interactions are formulated in a partial wave matrix representation in momentum space , which is not very suitable for visualizing position space properties of the potential . in this article",
    "we present a phase - space representation for nn interactions , which depends on relative distance and relative momentum .",
    "this allows to demonstrate momentum space properties as induced by the softening of the potential or non - localities originating from having different potentials in different partial waves . at the same time it also allows to study position space properties like the short - range repulsion and its renormalization or the effect of the srg transformation on the long - range part .",
    "one also sees effects in position space originating from cutoffs in momentum space .",

    "another motivation for the phase - space representation is that an intuitive and descriptive picture of the interaction is also helpful in creating an operator based representations for many - body methods that work with wave packets @xcite like antisymmetrized molecular dynamics @xcite or fermionic molecular dynamics @xcite because their basis states possess no angular momentum quantum numbers .",

    "[ fig : argonne ]  ( b ) the phase - space representation of the ucom transformed argonne potential .",
    "it contains besides the local and the quadratic angular momentum term also a term quadratic in momentum : @xmath214 in this case the expansion is also limited to @xmath215 . while the @xmath216 part contains only contributions from the angular momentum term , @xmath217 has now also input from the quadratic momentum term .",
    "in contrast to the bare argonne potential , the @xmath218 part of the ucom transformed argonne potential shows for @xmath219 a much softer potential , which was of course the intention of ucom . on the other hand",
    "a clear @xmath40-dependence originating from the new @xmath50 term of the ucom transformed potential appears .",
    "one might wonder about the behavior of the phase - space representation at small distances @xmath39 and high momenta @xmath40 where it becomes strongly negative .",
    "but one has to keep in mind that the @xmath50 term in the ucom potential originates from the transformation of the kinetic energy @xmath220 .",
    "the full hamilton function , obtained by adding the kinetic energy @xmath221 again , is still repulsive in this region . in a classical view",
    "the momentum dependencies change the relative velocity of the particle pair . in the repulsive core area they speed up and spend less time there so that the density is depleted , which corresponds to the correlation hole in the wave function .",
    "the phase - space representation therefore shows in a very lucid way how the unitary ucom transformation , which does not alter the phase shifts , succeeds in softening the potential by introducing momentum dependencies .    the phase - space representation of @xmath222 in fig .",
    "[ fig : argonne ]  ( b ) was obtained by first calculating its antisymmetrized matrix elements @xmath223 and then performing the procedure explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : antisymmpsr ] to extract the phase - space representation of @xmath222 from its matrix elements . the direct way to get @xmath74 from the known operator form of @xmath222 was used to test if the procedure is working properly .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : argonne ]  ( c ) and ( d ) we display the phase - space representation of the srg transformed argonne potential for two values of the flow parameter .",
    "for @xmath224 , a typical value used in many - body calculations , the srg transformed interaction looks quite different from the ucom one , although the correlation function @xmath168 , which determines the ucom transformation , was taken to map the zero energy scattering solution for @xmath189 onto the srg solution for @xmath224 ( as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : rp - l ] ) .",
    "the first striking difference is that for @xmath53 and @xmath191 the srg potential is at all distances @xmath39 attractive while the ucom potential is still repulsive for @xmath225 .",
    "the original argonne potential turns repulsive at @xmath226 .",
    "the second conspicuous feature of the srg potential is its long range , much longer than that of the original potential .",
    "this aspect and its consequences will be discussed further in fig .",
    "[ fig : core ] .    with increasing momentum @xmath40 the @xmath53 srg transformed potential becomes more and more repulsive at short distances @xmath39 .",
    "a further interesting , but annoying , result is that for all @xmath46 at large @xmath198 oscillations develop , quite at variance with the ucom transformed interaction .",
    "srg evolves the effective interaction in the different @xmath70-channels independently , while ucom uses operators . as already indicated in the previous sec .",
    "[ sec : rp - l ] independent treatment of the @xmath70-channels may lead to complicated momentum dependencies showing up at larger values of @xmath198 .",
    "the speed of the evolution of @xmath174 may very well differ for different @xmath70 because it is determined by the strength of the generator @xmath227 $ ] which increases with the curvature of @xmath174 .",
    "or in other words , the larger an off - diagonal matrix element @xmath228 is , the faster it decreases in size .",
    "therefore @xmath229 is smoothened differently from @xmath230 and both channels can not be interpreted anymore as being projected from a potential with a simple momentum dependence .    in @xmath231-body space",
    "the srg transformation leaves the observables invariant if the evolution eq .",
    "includes up to @xmath231-body operators .",
    "that means that the oscillations at large @xmath198 in 2-body space have to be compensated by induced many - body forces .",
    "this might explain the fact , that large scale shell model calculations for larger mass numbers show significant contributions from 3-body and higher terms in the srg evolved effective interaction , see ref .",
    "@xcite .    for the large flow parameter @xmath232 ,",
    "corresponding to a very soft potential , the oscillations are still present , see fig .",
    "[ fig : argonne ]  ( d ) .    fig .",
    "[ fig : argonnet0 ] displays the same phase - space representations as fig .",
    "[ fig : argonne ] but for @xmath207 , i.e. the ucom transformed one and the srg descendants for @xmath224 and @xmath232 .",
    "both , the ucom and srg transformation soften the strong repulsion but srg produces again oscillations .",
    "all considerations and discussions for the even channels also apply here for the odd channels and need not be repeated .    the phase - space representation for @xmath233 , @xmath176 is not shown for @xmath234 because the spatial part of the wave function has to be antisymmetric and",
    "thus only odd @xmath70 contribute . as there is no information for @xmath195 available , our method was not able to extract numerically stable results from the matrix elements in the region @xmath234 .",
    "but this is also not necessary because states with @xmath235 can not probe this area .",
    "the last example shows the phase - space representation of the chiral n3lo potential for @xmath236 , @xmath208 from entem and machleidt @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : n3lo ]  ( a ) ) .",
    "its two - body part includes pion - exchange contributions and local and non - local contact terms .",
    "furthermore , the potential is regularized by a ( smooth ) momentum cutoff at @xmath237 . to describe the momentum dependence of the n3lo potential , we need terms at least up to @xmath162 in the expansion of phase - space representation . for @xmath53 and @xmath191",
    "the phase - space representation shows repulsion at short distances , although much weaker than in case of the argonne interaction , and attraction at larger distances . with increasing @xmath40",
    "the phase - space representation clearly visualizes the momentum cutoff around @xmath238 . for higher @xmath46 one sees momentum structures that are more complicated than those of the argonne potential .",
    "[ fig : n3lo ]  ( b ) and ( c ) display the phase - space representations of the srg transformed n3lo potential for @xmath224 and @xmath232 .",
    "below @xmath239 srg clearly softens the bare n3lo and the transformed potentials are rather smooth . but for larger momenta @xmath40 they develop a lively @xmath39 and @xmath40 dependence , that is even more pronounced than for the bare n3lo interaction . the ucom transformation of the n3lo interaction is shown because it has not been investigated yet .",
    "finally we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : core ] the local projections of the potentials as defined in eq .  .",
    "the results agree with those in fig .  2 of ref .",
    "@xcite as explained above .",
    "the bare n3lo potential is much less repulsive than the bare argonne potential but a repulsive force , as given by the gradient of the potential , sets in already for @xmath240 .",
    "furthermore there is an overshooting above @xmath241 despite the fact that also in n3lo the long range part is determined by pion exchange .",
    "this overshooting is a fringe effect , which results from the cutoff in momentum space . due to the power counting in momentum one feels obliged to sharpen the cutoff function @xmath242 with higher order @xmath243 . but",
    "this leads to more pronounced fringes , which we regard as problematic .",
    "@xcite emphasizes the universal behavior of the srg evolved interactions seen in the similarity of the local projections of the evolved argonne and n3lo potentials . by comparing fig .",
    "[ fig : argonne ]  ( d ) with fig .",
    "[ fig : n3lo ]  ( c ) one realizes that the universality is not only seen at @xmath244 but extends to about @xmath245 .",
    "one could not anticipate this by looking at the pseudo - local projection for @xmath246 displayed in fig .  4 of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the argonne and the n3lo case still differ substantially .",
    "there are infinitely many non - local potentials with identical phase shifts , which differ in their degree of non - locality or momentum dependence .",
    "they also differ in the size of their corresponding three- and more - body interactions that are needed to correctly describe many - body systems .",
    "in such a situation the question arises how to constrain the form of the nuclear interaction beyond general symmetry considerations such that it is useful and numerically manageable for a wide variety of low energy nuclear structure applications .",
    "our intuition favors local potentials because in daily life they are very successful for describing the forces between two objects .",
    "the reason is that usually the relative velocity @xmath247 of the two objects is small .",
    "there are essentially two smallness conditions , the first is that @xmath247 is small compared to the speed of light @xmath248 , so that retardation effects can be neglected and an instantaneous action at a distance picture with a static potential is suited , like the coulomb potential .",
    "the lowest order relativistic correction , proportional to @xmath249 , is the lorentz force , or for particles with spin and magnetic moment , like nucleons or electrons , the spin - orbit interaction . the next order @xmath250 terms originate from relativistic kinematics or the relativistic energy - momentum relation . in the case of nucleons",
    "a typical speed is given by the fermi momentum of 260  mev / c which corresponds to @xmath251 .",
    "therefore relativistic effects are expected to be small but not negligible .",
    "the second smallness condition comes when one regards the interaction between two objects that are composed of particles bound together by their mutual microscopic interaction , like two atoms or two nucleons .",
    "the potential between the electrically or color neutral particles is then of the van der waals type and originates from the microscopic electric or microscopic strong interaction between the constituents . in that case",
    "one can imagine for the pair at rest a static local potential as function of the distance @xmath39 between their center of masses .",
    "the local potential is defined as the total energy of the two - body system minus the total energy at large distance , where the two objects do not interact anymore .",
    "this is a useful picture if the relative velocity is much smaller than the intrinsic velocities of the constituents ( the electrons in case of atom - atom potentials ) so that the mutual polarization can readjust instantaneously . in the case of atoms",
    "the chemical reactions proceed at small enough velocities so that one can usually work with local potentials .    for nucleons",
    "the situation is different .",
    "if one takes as an estimate of the time scale for polarization the excitation energy of the @xmath252-resonance of 300  mev , which corresponds to an oscillation time of 4  fm/@xmath248 , one would argue that for a static local potential a typical interaction time or passage should be much longer than that . for traveling a distance of 2  fm at fermi velocity",
    "one needs about 7  fm/@xmath248 , which is of the same order as the oscillation time and the polarization can not adjust instantaneously .",
    "this simple estimate indicates already that virtual excitations of resonances should play an important role and lead to non - localities or momentum dependencies and many - body interactions when the resonances are not treated as explicit degrees of freedom .    from these simple arguments it is not surprising that a purely local potential can not fit the phase shifts of nucleon - nucleon scattering up to @xmath253  mev or the corresponding @xmath254 .",
    "but it still makes sense to expand in @xmath249 or @xmath255 and keep terms up to @xmath65 or @xmath256 if needed .",
    "reproducing measured phase shifts is only one part of the task in modeling the nuclear interaction . in an interacting many - body system like a nucleus ,",
    "the nucleon pairs are not on - shell , meaning that they neither have a sharp energy nor is their relative momentum in the same way related to their mutual energy as in the scattering process .",
    "furthermore , as they are interacting simultaneously with other nucleons their relative angular momentum is also not in an eigenstate of @xmath144",
    ". therefore information coming from bound many - body states can and should be used to reduce the arbitrariness in non - local versus local parts or in off - shell properties",
    ".    for these reasons it makes sense to start with an operator structure that has local radial dependencies augmented with low powers in @xmath257 and @xmath258 in accordance with the global symmetries like invariance under parity , rotation and translation .",
    "the power expansion together with spin and isospin structures can then be used to establish perturbative counting schemes based on chiral symmetry . keeping an operator based interaction of this type",
    "will prevent the introduction of uncontrolled off - shell behavior in the many - body case and also hopefully avoids the need for @xmath243-body interactions with ever increasing @xmath243 .",
    "it is very desirable to develop schemes that do not produce complicated non - localities or momentum dependencies , neither when choosing the resolution scale nor when re - normalizing to low momentum many - body hilbert spaces .",
    "recently there have been attempts @xcite to use local regulators in chiral effective field theories .",
    "the non - smooth behavior of the resulting potential @xcite might indicate deficiencies of the presently employed regulators .",
    "reproducing nuclear phase shifts up to @xmath259mev with a non - relativistic schrdinger equation requires two - body interactions that are non - local in coordinate space or in other words momentum dependent . as a rule of thumb",
    "one can say that potentials with a weak momentum dependence ( almost local ) exhibit a strong short range repulsion while softer potentials have a stronger momentum dependence . although all realistic potentials , may they have stronger or weaker momentum dependence , describe the nuclear two - body problem equally well , they can give quite different results in the many - body case .",
    "this is to some extend compensated in the many - body system by appropriate many - body forces that come along with the respective two - body interaction .",
    "while many - body quantum monte carlo methods @xcite work best with local potentials , methods based on many - body hilbert spaces spanned by slater determinants converge better when softer interactions are used .",
    "the reason is that a slater determinant basis can not represent with sufficient accuracy the short range repulsive and tensor correlations induced by a hard interaction .    as these correlations at nuclear densities are mainly of short ranged two - body type and universal in the sense that they do not depend on the mass number of the nucleus or its excitation energy @xcite it should be possible to renormalize them into the effective interaction without strong induced three- or higher - body contributions . therefore a useful strategy would be to renormalize a given hard interaction only at small distances",
    ". then it should be sufficient to include only the three - body part of the induced many - body interactions , as the probability to find four and more particles simultaneously close together is very small .",
    "this concept is pursued by ucom but the calculation of induced many - body interactions in ucom is very complicated . on the other hand a srg transformation that explicitly takes the universality of short - range correlations into account has still to be developed .",
    "another approach is to limit the resolution scale already in the derivation of the interaction and to seek a smallness parameter to order the possible contributions that are allowed by symmetries .",
    "however , if one wants to retain the phase shifts the above rule of thumbs applies in any case .    in many of these attempts",
    "one represents the interaction in terms of momentum space matrix elements because they are well suited for calculating phase shifts and many - body matrix elements .",
    "also similarity renormalization group methods naturally work within such a basis .",
    "a drawback in doing that is that the explicit operator structure of the interaction and the intuitive picture is lost .",
    "this paper attempts to recover the intuition by extracting the kirkwood phase - space representation of the interaction from a given set of matrix elements . with this phase - space representation",
    "one can visualize for example in a quantitative way the difference in momentum dependence between the softer n3lo chiral potential and the hard argonne potential .",
    "one also sees how ucom or srg renormalization transforms short range repulsion into momentum dependence ( retaining the phase shifts ) .",
    "one observes that the srg transformation shows a universal behavior not only for the local projection , i.e. at momentum @xmath191 , but results in a dominant @xmath53 part , which depends only on @xmath39 and @xmath40 , with a weak quadratic @xmath40-dependence for momenta up to @xmath260@xmath261 .",
    "the @xmath262 parts are an order of magnitude smaller or in other words the dependence on @xmath71 , @xmath263 and @xmath264 is weaker indicating that an ansatz with low powers in @xmath144 should be sufficient .",
    "but the phase - space representation uncovers also peculiarities that are hidden in the matrix element representation , like the effects of inconsiderate ways of implementing momentum cutoffs or shortcomings of the renormalization .",
    "one sees for example that the srg transformation develops an irregular phase - space behavior for momenta @xmath40 larger than about 1.5@xmath261 for the argonne potential and about 1.2@xmath261 for the n3lo potential , which limits the range of the smooth universal behavior .",
    "one should investigate if an appropriate choice of the srg generator can extend the range , because 1.2@xmath261 is still below the fermi momentum @xmath265 .    in continuation of the work presented in this paper",
    "the phase - space representation will be extended to include spin - orbit and tensor forces in the @xmath266 channels .",
    "this work was supported by the helmholtz alliance program of the helmholtz association , contract ha216/emmi `` extremes of density and temperature : cosmic matter in the laboratory '' .",
    "in the following we calculate @xmath267 by expanding first @xmath107 and then @xmath268 in spherical harmonics .",
