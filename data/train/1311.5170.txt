    "this paper is devoted to the study of periodic solutions of the rod equation .",
    "a first physical motivation comes from the study of the response of hyper - elastic rings under the action of an initial radial stretch .",
    "as the nonlinear dispersive waves propagating inside it could eventually lead to cracks , an important problem is the determination of conditions that must be fulfilled in order to prevent their formation .",
    "the main issue of the present paper will be a precise description of crack mechanisms inside such rings .",
    "a second reason for studying periodic solutions is that periodic waves spontaneously arise also in hyper - elastic rods : indeed , it has been recently observed that the solitary waves propagating inside an ideally infinite length rod can suddenly feature a transition into waves with finite period as their amplitude increases , see @xcite .",
    "our third motivation comes from the study of shallow water waves inside channels .",
    "indeed , the camassa  holm equation ( at least in the dispersionless case ) is a particular case , corresponding to @xmath2 , of the rod equation below : if the motion of small amplitude waves is usually modeled by the kdv equation , larger amplitude waves , and in particular breaking waves , are more accurately described by the camassa  holm equation .",
    "in fact , both the kdv and the camassa  holm equation can be rigorously derived as an asymptotic model from the free surface euler equations for irrotational inviscid flows , in the so - called shallow water regime @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote respectively the average elevation of the liquid over the bottom and the characteristic wavelength .",
    "the camassa ",
    "holm equation models small , but finite , amplitude waves , _",
    "i.e. _ waves such that the dimensionless amplitude parameter @xmath6 satisfies @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the typical amplitude , whereas the derivation of kdv would require the more stringent scaling @xmath9 . the camassa ",
    "holm equation thus better captures the genuinely nonlinear behavior of larger amplitude waves and , contrary to kdv , admits both permanent solutions and solutions that blow up in finite time . for a detailed discussion on these issues , see @xcite .",
    "let @xmath10 be the unit circle .",
    "the cauchy problem for the periodic rod equation is written as follows : @xmath11 the real parameter @xmath1 is related to the finger deformation tensor of the material .",
    "both positive and negative values  @xmath1 are admissible .",
    "we refer to @xcite for more details on the physical background and the mathematical derivation of the model .",
    "the function  @xmath12 in   is the kernel of the convolution operator @xmath13 .",
    "it is the continuous @xmath14-periodic function given by @xmath15 - 1/2)}{2\\sinh(1/2)},\\ ] ] where @xmath16 $ ] denotes the integer part .",
    "the camassa ",
    "holm case @xmath2 is somewhat particular , as in this case   inherits a bi - hamiltonian structure and the equation is completely integrable , in the sense of infinite - dimensional hamiltonian systems : in suitable variables ( action - angle ) , the flow is equivalent to a linear flow at constant speed on the jacobi variety associated to a ( mostly infinite - dimensional ) torus , cf . the discussion in @xcite .",
    "moreover , the camassa - holm equation is a re - expression of geodesic flow on the diffeomorphism group of the circle , see the discussion in @xcite . for these reasons , many important results valid for the camassa",
    " holm equation do not go through in the general case .",
    "for example , in the case of the camassa ",
    "holm equation on the real line , a striking necessary and sufficient condition for the global existence of strong solution can be given in terms on the initial potential @xmath17 , see  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , very little is known on the global existence of strong solutions when @xmath18 : it can even happen ( when @xmath19 ) that all nonzero solutions blow up in finite time .",
    "smooth solitary waves that are global strong solutions were constructed at least for some  @xmath1 , see  @xcite .",
    "these are essentially the only known examples of global smooth solutions",
    ".    our working assumption will be that @xmath20 belongs to the sobolev space @xmath21 , for some @xmath22 .",
    "then , for any @xmath23 , the cauchy problem for the rod equation is locally well - posed , in the sense that there exist a maximal time @xmath24 and a unique solution @xmath25 . moreover , the solution  @xmath26 depends continuously on the initial data .",
    "it is also known that  @xmath26 admits several invariant integrals , among which the energy integral , @xmath27 in particular , because of the conservation of the sobolev @xmath28-norm , the solution @xmath29 remains uniformly bounded up to the time  @xmath30 . on the other hand , if @xmath31 then @xmath32 ( @xmath22 ) and the precise blowup scenario , often named wave breaking mechanism , is the following : @xmath33 see , _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "we will state our two main theorems in the next section after preparing some notations .",
    "loosely , the first theorem asserts that if @xmath34 is _ not too small _ , then there exist a constant @xmath35 such that if @xmath36 in at least one point @xmath37 , then the solution arising from @xmath38 must blow up in finite time .",
    "our second theorem quantifies the above result : it precises what `` @xmath34 not too small '' means , addressing also the delicate issue of finding sharp estimates for  @xmath39 .",
    "for example , in the particular case of the periodic _ camassa  holm _ equation we get that a sufficient condition for the blowup is : @xmath40    an analogue but weaker result was recently established in our previous paper  @xcite , where we dealt with non - periodic solutions on the whole real line with vanishing boundary conditions as @xmath41 . in the present paper , we take advantage of the specific structure of periodic solutions in order to make improvements on our previous work in two directions .",
    "first of all , the analogue blowup result for the rod equation on  @xmath42 could be established in  @xcite only in the range @xmath43 in the non - periodic case .",
    "but the relevant estimates on the circle that we will establish turn out to be much stronger .",
    "they allow us to cover blowup results of periodic solutions _",
    "e.g. _ for arbitrary large @xmath1 ( or @xmath1 negative and arbitrary small ) .",
    "the following corollary of theorem  [ maintheo ] is therefore specific to periodic solutions :    [ coro - as ] there exists an absolute constant @xmath44 ( it can be checked numerically that @xmath45 ) with the following property . if @xmath38 , with @xmath22 , is such that for some @xmath37 , @xmath46 , or otherwise @xmath47 , then the solutions ( unique , but depending on  @xmath1 ) of the rod equation   arising from @xmath20 blow up in finite time respectively if @xmath48 or @xmath49 . in both cases ,",
    "the maximal existence time is @xmath50 as @xmath51 .",
    "there is a second important difference between in the behavior of periodic and non - periodic solutions .",
    "it can happen that two initial data @xmath38 and @xmath52 agree on an arbitrarily large finite interval , and that periodic solution arising from @xmath20 blows up , whereas the solution arising from @xmath53 and vanishing at infinity exists globally . as a comparison , the blowup criterion in  @xcite for solutions in @xmath54 of the camassa ",
    "holm equation reads @xmath55 ; on the other hand , according to  , in the periodic case the condition @xmath56 would be enough for the development of a singularity .",
    "in general , for @xmath57 $ ] , the coefficient @xmath39 in   is considerably lower than the corresponding coefficient @xmath58 computed in  @xcite for the blowup criterion of non - periodic solutions .",
    "the most important feature of our blowup criteria  - is that it they are _ local - in - space_. this means that these criteria involve a condition _ only on a small neighborhood of a single point _ of the datum .",
    "their validity is somewhat surprising , as equation   is non - local .",
    "a huge number of previous papers addressed the blowup issue of solutions to equation  , ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite ; ( the older references only dealt with the camassa  holm equation ) .",
    "but the corresponding blowup criteria systematically involved the computation of some global quantities of @xmath20 : typically , conditions of the form @xmath59 or some other integral conditions on @xmath20 , or otherwise antisymmetry conditions , etc .",
    "the main idea ( inspired to us combining those of @xcite ) will be to study the evolution of @xmath60 and @xmath61 along the trajectories of the flow map of  @xmath62 , for an appropriate parameter  @xmath63 to be determined in order to optimize the blowup result .",
    "the main technical issue of the present paper will be the study of a two - parameters family of minimization problems .",
    "such minimization problems arise when computing the best constants in the relevant convolution estimates .",
    "calculus of variation tools have been already successfully used for the study of blowup criteria of the rod equation , see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite .",
    "the difference with respect to these papers is that our approach requires the minimization of non - coercive functionals .",
    "once such minima are computed , the proof of the blowup can follow the steps of  @xcite .",
    "we finish this introduction by mentioning a second simple consequence of our main theorem  [ maintheo ] , that seems to be of independent interest .",
    "its result applies in particular to the case @xmath2 .",
    "it is a new result ( at best of our knowledge ) also for the camassa  holm equation .",
    "[ cnge ] let @xmath64 , be a global solution of the rod equation   with @xmath65 or @xmath66 ( where @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) .",
    "if @xmath26 vanishes at some point @xmath69 , then @xmath26 must be the trivial solution : @xmath70 for all @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "corollary  [ cnge ] improves an earlier result by a.  constantin and j.  escher @xcite , asserting that the trivial solution is the only global solution of the periodic camassa ",
    "holm equation such that _ for all @xmath71 , @xmath73 such that @xmath74_. basically , we manage to replace their condition  `` @xmath75  '' by the much weaker one `` @xmath76  '' . more importantly , unlike  @xcite",
    ", our approach will make use of only few properties of the equation , and is more suitable for generalizations .",
    "it might be surprising that our results _ a priori _ excludes a small neighborhood of the origin for the parameter  @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , such restriction might be purely technical .",
    "however , one should observe that @xmath77 _ must be excluded_. the reason is that for @xmath77 all solutions arising from @xmath38 are global in time . indeed",
    ", the blowup scenario   is never fulfilled .",
    "it is worth noticing that for @xmath77 the rod equation reduces to the bbm equation introduced by benjamin , bona and mahony in  @xcite as a model for surface wave in channels .",
    "we will establish a result similar to that of corollary  [ cnge ] for non - periodic solutions vanishing for @xmath41 ( see corollary  [ cnge2 ] at the end of the paper for the precise statement ) . in this case , we will need that the global solution  @xmath26 is such that @xmath78 in at least two different points , or otherwise that @xmath79 decays sufficiently fast as @xmath41 to conclude that @xmath80 for all @xmath81 .",
    "in section  [ sec : two ] we state our main results , theorem  [ maintheo ] and theorem  [ theoquant ] .",
    "the first theorem is proved in section  [ sec : first p ] . in section  [ sec : fo ] we study a minimization problem that will play an important role for the proof of theorem  [ theoquant ] , given in section  [ sec : tq ] .",
    "corollary  [ coro - as ] will immediately follows from assertion  ( ii ) of this theorem .",
    "we will study in more detail the camassa ",
    "holm equation in section  [ sec : ch ] .",
    "corollary  [ cnge ] is established in section  [ sec : cor ] where we also provide some new results for non - periodic solutions .",
    "an appendix showing the agreement between our theorems and some numerical results concludes the paper .",
    "we start preparing some notations . for any real constant @xmath82 and @xmath83 ,",
    "let @xmath84 defined by @xmath85 proposition  [ prop1 ] below will characterize the set of parameters @xmath86 for which the functional appearing in   is bounded from below as well as the subset for which the infimum is achieved .",
    "we also introduce , for @xmath87 , the quantity @xmath88 $ ] defined by @xmath89 with the usual convention that @xmath90 if the infimum is taken on the empty set .",
    "our main result is the following blowup theorem :    [ maintheo ] let @xmath87 be such that @xmath91 .",
    "let @xmath38 with @xmath22 and assume that there exists @xmath37 , such that @xmath92 then the corresponding solution @xmath26 of equation   in @xmath93 arising from @xmath20 blows up in finite time . moreover , the maximal time  @xmath30 is estimated by @xmath94 and , for some @xmath95 , the blowup rate is @xmath96    theorem  [ maintheo ] is meaningful only if @xmath1 is such that @xmath91 .",
    "the validity of such condition is _ a priori _ not clear , as it might happen that the set in equation   is empty .",
    "an important part of the present paper will be devoted to the technical issue of discussing the validity of the condition @xmath91 and next estimating @xmath39 .",
    "this will be done by establishing some sharp estimates on @xmath97 .    in order to state our next theorem ,",
    "let us introduce the complex number @xmath98 where @xmath99 denotes any of the two complex square roots .",
    "we also consider the four constants ( that will be constructed in   below ) : @xmath100    [ theoquant ]    * for any @xmath101\\cup[\\gamma_1^+,+\\infty)$ ] , we have @xmath91 , so that theorem  [ maintheo ] applies in such range . more precisely , if @xmath102\\cup[\\gamma_2^+,\\infty)$ ] , then @xmath103 if otherwise @xmath104\\cup[\\gamma_1^+,\\gamma_2^+]$ ] , then @xmath39 can be estimated as in inequality   below ( in  , @xmath105 denotes legendre function of the first kind of degree  @xmath106 ) . *",
    "the limit @xmath107 does exist and @xmath108    it is worth observing that we have @xmath109 if and only if @xmath19 .",
    "this can be checked directly from the definitions  - .",
    "accordingly , the right - hand side in   vanishes for @xmath19 . in particular , we recover the known fact ( see @xcite ) that for @xmath19 any nonzero initial datum @xmath38 ( with @xmath22 ) gives rise to a solution that blows up in finite time . moreover , the maximal time  @xmath30 satisfies @xmath110    the upper bounds   are not optimal but , strikingly , they are _ almost sharp_. indeed we can compute the numerical approximation of @xmath39 with arbitrary high precision .",
    "we find that the error between the above bounds and the numerical value is only of order @xmath111 .",
    "for example , we find @xmath112 that is indeed very close to the bound  . moreover , in the camassa  holm case , we find numerically that @xmath113 .",
    "this is in good agreement with estimate  , that for @xmath2 provided us with the bound @xmath114 .",
    "we will devote the appendix to a more detailed discussion of the numerical results .",
    "such analysis will also show that the effective range of applicability of theorem  [ maintheo ] is slightly larger than the range @xmath115\\cup[\\gamma_1^+,\\infty)$ ] predicted by theorem  [ theoquant ] .",
    "the reader should compare figure  [ upbound - betag ] with figure  [ courbe - beta - gamma ] at the end of the paper : the former plot is obtained analytically and the latter numerically .     given by theorem  [ theoquant ] .",
    "the estimate is valid outside the interval @xmath116 $ ] ( gray region).,title=\"fig:\",width=566,height=340 ] -3.5 cm    this paper does not address the problem of the continuation of the solution after the blowup as this issue is extensively studied in the literature .",
    "e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "for any real  @xmath83 , let us consider the 1-periodic function @xmath117 where @xmath12 is the kernel introduced in   and @xmath118 denotes the distributional derivative on  @xmath42 , that agrees in this case with the classical a.e .",
