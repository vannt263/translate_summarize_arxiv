    "the rather extensive literature concerning the `` inverse scattering problem '' and the `` inverse sturm - liouville problem '' on graphs have mostly followed separate pathways except for a very few results  @xcite . in the following paragraphs , we briefly recall the previous results on these subjects and at the end we will situate the result of this paper with respect to the others .",
    "indeed , as it will be seen later , the inverse sturm - liouville problem considered in this paper raises from the necessity of finding a minimal setup for solving the inverse scattering problem .",
    "the paper  @xcite considers a star - shape graph consisting of @xmath0 infinite branches and solves the inverse scattering problem assuming the measurement of @xmath1 reflection coefficients .",
    "next , in the paper  @xcite , harmer provides an extension of the previous result with general self - adjoint boundary conditions at the central node .",
    "this however necessitates the knowledge of @xmath0 reflection coefficients .",
    "+ the paper  @xcite studies the relation between the scattering data and the topology of the graph .",
    "they show that the knowledge of the scattering matrix is not enough to determine uniquely the topological structure of a generic graph . in  @xcite ,",
    "avdonin and kurasov consider again a star - shape graph with @xmath0 finite branches .",
    "they , show that the knowledge of one diagonal element of the response operator allows one to reconstruct the potential on the edge corresponding to this element .",
    "as mentioned above , in parallel to the research on inverse scattering problems , another class of papers consider the inverse problem for sturm - liouville operators on compact graphs .",
    "these results can be seen as extensions of the classical result provided by borg  @xcite , on the recovering of the sturm - liouville operator from two spectra on a finite interval .",
    "the main progress in this field has been made by yurko  @xcite ,  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the paper  @xcite deals with the inverse spectral problem on a tree .",
    "the idea is to generalize the borg s result in the following sense : for a tree with @xmath2 boundary vertices , it is sufficient to know @xmath2 spectra , corresponding to @xmath2 different settings for boundary conditions at the extremities , to retrieve the potentials on the tree . in the recent paper  @xcite , the same kind of result",
    "is proposed for a star - shape graph including a loop joined to the central node .",
    "finally , @xcite provides a generalization of  @xcite to higher order differential operators on a star - shape graph .",
    "+ in  @xcite , the author proves that under some restrictive assumptions on the spectrum of a sturm - liouville operator on a star - shape graph with some fixed boundary conditions , the knowledge of this spectra can determine uniquely the sturm - liouille operator .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the inverse scattering problem motivated by the application in fault - detection / diagnostic of star - shape lc transmission networks .",
    "we are interested in minimal experimental setting providing enough information on the network and the potentials on its branches .",
    "the graph consists of @xmath0 finite branches joined at a central node and we add a infinite branch to this central node for the experimentation .",
    "we will see that the knowledge of the reflection coefficient is equivalent to the knowledge of the spectra for the sturm - liouville operator defined on the compact part of the graph for various boundary conditions at the central node . by considering the associated inverse sturm - liouville problem",
    ", we will show that under some assumptions on the geometry of the metric graph , the knowledge of only two reflection coefficients , corresponding to two settings for the boundary conditions at the terminal nodes , is enough to determine the potentials ( at least locally ) .    in the next section",
    ", we explain the application under study and the associated experimental setup .",
    "we will show that the inverse scattering problem for the so - called telegrapher s equation ( lossless case ) on the network is equivalent to an inverse scattering problem for a schrdinger operator over the metric graph of the network . in section  [ sec :",
    "direct ] , we will consider the direct scattering problem and we will characterize the reflection coefficient in terms of the fundamental solutions for sturm - liouville operators on branches . in section  [ sec : geometry ] , we will show that the knowledge of only one reflection coefficient is enough to identify the lengthes of the branches of the metric graph .",
    "this result will be useful to locate hard faults ( open or short circuits ) .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : potential ] we consider the main problem of recovering the potentials from the knowledge of one or two reflection coefficients .",
    "this result will be useful to locate soft faults ( local variations of the electrical characteristics).we will prove the equivalence of the inverse scattering problem with an associated inverse sturm - liouville problem on the compact part of the graph .",
    "this inverse problem is then treated applying the methods extending the classical result by borg  @xcite .",
    "the electric signal transmission through a wired network is , generally , modeled with the `` telegrapher s equation '' and characterized by the parameters @xmath3 ( functions of the space position @xmath4 along the transmission lines ) representing the inductance @xmath5 , capacitance @xmath6 , resistance @xmath7 and loss conductance @xmath8 per unit of length .",
    "these parameters allow a rather complete and understandable description of the transmission lines and are sufficient to represent the lines in the frequency range used during reflectometry . in the sequel",
    "we will suppose that this model can be used for all frequencies .",
    "however , it appears to be impossible to retrieve all these parameters uniquely through the information provided by reflectometry experiments . everywhere ,",
    "through this paper , we will consider the simpler nonuniform lossless situation ( @xmath9 ) . as we will see later ,",
    "the reflectometry measurement is still not enough to retrieve the both parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 but rather an aggregate of these two parameters , the local characteristic impedance @xmath10 .",
    "following  @xcite and  @xcite , the presentation of the reflectometry experiment of this section , is based on a model derived from the `` telegrapher s equation '' and parameterized by @xmath11 . to cope with the network case , we have translated the kirchhoff rules at the nodes of the network within this new modeling framework .",
    "note that , in this paper , we restrict ourselves to the case of a simple star - shape network and therefore the only node of the graph where the kirchhoff rules need to be adapted is the central one .",
    "the faults , in which we are interested through this approach , are represented by the lengths of the branches ( hard faults ) and by the heterogeneities of @xmath11 along the branches ( soft faults ) .",
    "the considered reflectometry experiment model is based on a far - field method consisting in adding a uniform infinite wire joined to the network at its central node . in practice , connecting a matched charge to the extremity of a finite line , is sufficient to emulate the electrical propagation through an infinite line .",
    "the linearity of the transmission line model allows to replace any test by an equivalent test in harmonic regime .",
    "we can therefore start by stating the telegrapher s equation in the harmonic regime , i.e. the tension and the current intensity are respectively of the form @xmath12 and @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the time frequency and @xmath4 the position . on each line , we have    @xmath15    through this paper , we assume that    * a1 * : :    the distributed parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17    are twice continuously differentiable on the transmission lines ; * a2 * : :    they are strictly positive , @xmath18 ; * a3 * : :    the characteristic impedance @xmath10 is    continuous at the central node of the star - shape network ; * a4 * : :    the transmission lines are uniform in a neighborhood of the    extremities of the branches .    _ the liouville transformation . _",
    "note that the reflectometry experiment leads to observing the tensions and currents along the time at some position : only the travelling times ( and amplitudes ) of waves are accessible by such experiments .",
    "a fault can only be localized in terms of the traveling time of the reflected test wave starting from the test point .",
    "this leads to a particular change of variables , the liouville transformation , allowing to work with the traveling time rather than spatial coordinates .",
    "let us recall this transformation : @xmath19 which corresponds to the wave traveling time from the position @xmath20 to the position @xmath4 .",
    "remark that after this transformation , @xmath14 is also the wave number on each branch .",
    "the inverse transformation being well defined , we will write @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the telegrapher s equation   becomes    @xmath25    _ the wave decomposition and equivalent forms of the telegrapher s equation .",
    "_ define @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "we have the following decomposition of @xmath28 :    @xmath29    in particular , in an interval where a branch is uniform , @xmath30 , and the solution is the sum of waves of opposite directions . for any @xmath31 and @xmath32 in this interval : @xmath33",
    "define now @xmath34 and @xmath35 , with @xmath36 .",
    "the telegrapher s equation   becomes a schrdinger equation : @xmath37    it can be seen from and , that , the knowledge of the potential @xmath38 or of @xmath39 and of the boundary conditions on @xmath28 and @xmath40 is sufficient to compute the solution of on the network . in our lossless situation ,",
    "we have chosen @xmath41 as the parameter to be identified through the reflectometry experiment .",
    "a variant of , the zakharov - shabat equations , would be the good choice in the more general lossy case .",
    "remark that @xmath42 .",
    "_ the reflection coefficient .",
    "_ taking @xmath43 , oriented toward the increasing @xmath32 , as a reference forward wave , the reflection coefficient is the following ratio of backward over forward wave amplitudes : @xmath44 . in particular , @xmath45 : defined in this way , the reflection coefficient is constant in intervals where @xmath11 is constant . for an arbitrary @xmath32 ,",
    "denoting by @xmath46 the ( possibly infinite ) apparent impedance at @xmath32 , we still define the reflection coefficient as being @xmath47 with this definition , in general , @xmath48 , and , using , it is easy to check that @xmath7 is solution of the following riccati equation : @xmath49 finally , note that , we will only consider `` positive real '' terminal impedances @xmath50 , in the sense that @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "this together with the fact that @xmath53 is positive implies that @xmath54 .",

    "we have @xmath69 and @xmath70 for all @xmath71 . as , @xmath45 , the reflection coefficient",
    "can then be determined from the measurement of the tension @xmath72 anywhere in @xmath67 . in the sequel , we will use a test branch @xmath59 with a constant @xmath11 connecting a matched generator to the central node . the measured reflection coefficient on this branch ,",
    "will be simply written @xmath73 . as we will work with @xmath74",
    ", we choose @xmath75 , so that @xmath76 .",
    "finally , it will be convenient to take the same positive orientation on all the branches , from the central node at @xmath77 toward the increasing @xmath32 .",

    "_ in order to recover the potential of the star - shape network , we will need to consider two experimental settings , with open circuit or short circuit at the extremities of the branches .",
    "this will lead to a problem similar to solving an inverse spectral problem for the sturm - liouville operator when two spectra are known .",
    "the first setting corresponds to open circuit configuration at the extremities of the finite branches ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "this , together with the assumption  * a4 * on the local uniformity of the lines around @xmath62 s , leads to boundary conditions of the form @xmath80 , or equivalently , we obtain the setting called , the neumann configuration : @xmath81    the second setting corresponds to the short circuit configuration at the extremities of the finite branches ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "this leads to boundary conditions of the form @xmath82 , or equivalently , we obtain the setting called , the dirichlet configuration : @xmath83    [ rem : riccati ] in some of the applications that we have in mind , the reflectometry experiment has to take place without perturbing significantly the normal utilization of the transmission network , so that using open or short circuits conditions would be impossible .",
    "there is a way to circumvent this problem by computing the results of the open or short circuit experiments from results of two less invasive experiments .",
    "the idea is to use nonlinear superposition properties of solutions of riccati equations as in @xcite , in order to get a closed - form representation of the reflection coefficient , solution of , as a function of a general load impedance ( value of @xmath84 at the extremity of a branch ) and of two particular solutions corresponding to two load impedances more compatible with the network utilization .",
