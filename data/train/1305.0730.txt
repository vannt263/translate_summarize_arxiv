    "these solutions have been further studied in @xcite . the analytic solution for the entire black hole",
    "was constructed and shown to be one quarter - bps .",
    "for particular choices of prepotential and for particular values of the gauge couplings , these black holes can be embedded into m - theory and are asymptotic to @xmath9 .",
    "the goal of this work is to study supersymmetric , asymptotically @xmath0 black holes in more general gauged supergravities , with both vector and hypermultiplets .",
    "the specific theories we focus on are consistent truncations of string or m - theory .",
    "supersymmetric black holes in these theories involve running hypermultiplet scalars and are substantially different from the examples in @xcite .",
    "the presence of hypers prevents us from finding analytic solutions of the bps conditions , nevertheless we study analytically the space of supersymmetric horizon solutions @xmath10 and show that there is a large variety of them",
    ". we will then find explicit spherically symmetric black hole solutions interpolating between @xmath0 and @xmath11 by numerical methods .",
    "the black holes we construct have both electric and magnetic charges .    our demand that the supergravity theory is a consistent truncation of m - theory and that the asymptotic @xmath0 preserves @xmath1 supersymmetry limits our search quite severely .",
    "some of the gauged supergravity theories studied in @xcite correspond to the @xmath1 truncations @xcite of the de - wit / nicolai @xmath12 theory @xcite where only massless vector multiplets are kept . in this paper",
    "we will focus on more general theories obtained as consistent truncations of m - theory on seven - dimensional sasaki - einstein manifolds .",
    "a consistent truncation of eleven - dimensional supergravity on a sasaki - einstein manifold to a universal sector was obtained in @xcite .",
    "more recently the general reduction of eleven - dimensional supergravity to four dimensions on left - invariant coset manifolds with @xmath13-structure has been performed in @xcite . exploiting the coset structure of the internal manifold it is possible to truncate the theory in such a way to also keep massive kaluza - klein multiplets .",
    "these reductions can , by their very construction , be lifted directly to the higher dimensional theory and are guaranteed to solve the higher dimensional equations of motion .",
    "the black holes we construct represent the gravitational backreaction of bound states of m2 and m5-branes wrapped on curved manifolds in much the same manner as was detailed by maldacena and nunez @xcite for d3-branes in @xmath14 and m5-branes in @xmath15 . to preserve supersymmetry ,",

    "d3-branes , for particular charges , the bulk system will flow to @xmath16 in the ir and the entire solution represents an asymptotically @xmath17 black string .",
    "the general regular flow preserves just 2 real supercharges and thus in iib string theory it is @xmath18-bps .",
    "similarly , for the asymptotically @xmath19 , black m5-brane solutions , depending on the charges , the ir geometry is @xmath20 and the dual @xmath21 may have @xmath1 or @xmath22 supersymmetry .",
    "these @xmath1 scft s and their generalizations have been of much recent interest @xcite and the @xmath22 case has also been studied @xcite .    by embedding the @xmath0 black holes in m - theory",
    "we can see them as m2-brane wrapping a riemann surface .",
    "for particular charges , the bulk system will flow to @xmath23 in the ir and represents a black hole with regular horizon .",
    "the original examples found in @xcite can be reinterpreted in this way ; it has four equal magnetic charges and can be embedded in @xmath24 .",
    "the explicit analytic solution is known and it involves constant scalars and a hyperbolic horizon . a generalization of @xcite to m2-branes wrapping @xmath25 was performed in @xcite where certain very symmetric twists were considered . fully regular solutions for m2 branes wrapping a two - sphere with running scalars were finally found in @xcite in the form of @xmath0 black holes .",
    "it is note - worthy that of all these scenarios of branes wrapping riemann surfaces , the complete analytic solution for general charges is known only for m2-branes on @xmath25 with magnetic charges @xcite .",
    "one way to generalize these constructions of branes wrapped on @xmath25 is to have more general transverse spaces .",
    "this is the focus of this article . for m5-branes",
    "one can orbifold @xmath26 while for d3-branes one can replace @xmath27 by an arbitrary @xmath28 manifold and indeed a suitable consistent truncation on @xmath29 has indeed been constructed @xcite . for m2-branes one can replace @xmath30 by a seven - dimensional sasaki - einstein manifold @xmath4 and , as discussed above , the work of @xcite provides us with a rich set of consistent truncations to explore .",
    "interestingly , in our analysis we find that there are no solutions for pure m2-brane backgrounds , there must be additional electric and magnetic charges corresponding to wrapped m2 and m5-branes on internal cycles .",
    "asymptotically @xmath0 black holes with more general transverse space can be found in @xcite and @xcite where the solutions were studied directly in m - theory .",

    "the solution in @xcite can be considered as a state in the twisted abjm theory @xcite .",
    "the solutions we have found in this paper can be seen as states in ( twisted and deformed ) three dimensional chern - simons matter theory dual to the m - theory compactifications of homogeneous sasaki - einstein manifolds .",
    "one feature of these theories compared to abjm is the presence of many baryonic symmetries that couple to the vector multiplets arising from non trivial two - cycles in the sasaki - einstein manifold . in terms of the worldvolume theory ,",

    "the hypermultiplet scalars interact with the vector - multiplet scalars through the scalar potential : around a generic @xmath0 vacuum the eigenmodes mix the hypers and vectors . in the models we study ,",
    "we employ a particular simplification on the hypermultiplet scalar manifold and find solutions where only one real hypermultiplet scalar has a non - trivial profile .",
