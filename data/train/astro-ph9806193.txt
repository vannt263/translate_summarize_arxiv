    ", dressler 1980 ; lahav , nemiroff & piran 1990 , santiago & strauss 1992 ; loveday 1995 ; hermit 1996 ; guzzo 1997 ) implies that not all of them are exact tracers of the underlying mass distribution .",
    "it is obvious from the emptiness of large voids ( , kirshner 1987 ) and the spikiness of the galaxy distribution with @xmath17 spacing ( , broadhurst 1992 ) , especially at high redshifts ( steidel 1996 ; 1998 ) , that if the structure has evolved by standard gravitational instability theory ( gi ) then the galaxy distribution must be biased .",
    "arguments for different kinds of biasing schemes have been put forward and physical mechanisms for biasing have been proposed ( , kaiser 1984 ; davis 1985 ; bardeen 1996 ; dekel & silk 1986 ; dekel & rees 1987 ; braun , dekel & shapiro 1988 ; babul & white 1991 ; lahav & saslaw 1992 ) .",
    "cosmological simulations of galaxy formation clearly indicate galaxy biasing , even at the level of galactic halos ( , cen & ostriker 1992 ; kauffmann , nusser & steinmetz 1997 ; blanton 1998 ; somerville 1998 ) . the biasing becomes stronger at higher redshifts ( , bagla 1998a , 1998b ; jing & suto 1998 ; wechsler 1998 ) .",
    "the biasing scheme is interesting by itself as a constraint on the process of galaxy formation , but it is of even greater importance in many attempts to estimate the cosmological density parameter @xmath18 .",
    "if one assumes a linear and deterministic biasing relation of the sort @xmath19 between the density fluctuations of galaxies and mass , and applies the linear approximation for gravitational instability , @xmath20 with @xmath21 ( peebles 1980 ) , then the observables @xmath22 and @xmath23 are related via the degenerate combination @xmath24 .",
    "thus , one can not pretend to have determined @xmath18 by measuring @xmath13 without a detailed knowledge of the relevant biasing scheme .",
    "it turns out that different methods lead to different estimates of @xmath13 , sometimes from the same data themselves ( for reviews see dekel 1994 , table 1 ; strauss & willick 1995 , table 3 ; dekel , burstein & white 1997 ; dekel 1998a ) .",
    "most recent estimates for optical and iras galaxies lie in the range @xmath25 .",
    "the methods include , for example : ( a ) comparisons of local moments of @xmath1 ( from redshift surveys ) and @xmath2 ( from peculiar velocities ) or the corresponding power spectra or correlation functions ; ( b ) linear regressions of the fields @xmath1 and @xmath2 or the corresponding velocity fields ; ( c ) analyses of redshift distortions in redshift surveys ; and ( d ) comparisons of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) dipole with the local - group velocity as predicted from the galaxy distribution .    in order to sharpen our determination of @xmath18",
    "it is important that we understand the sources for this scatter in the estimates of @xmath13 .",
    "some of this scatter is due to the different types of galaxies involved , and some may be due to unaccounted - for effects of nonlinear gravity and perhaps other sources of systematic errors in the data or the methods . in this paper",
    "we investigate the possible contribution to this scatter by nontrivial properties of the biasing scheme  the deviations from linear biasing and the stochastic nature of the biasing scheme .",
    "this is done using a simple and natural formalism for general galaxy biasing .",
    "the biasing of density peaks in a gaussian random field is well formulated ( , kaiser 1984 ; bardeen 1986 ) and it provides a very crude theoretical framework for the origin of galaxy density biasing . in this scheme , the galaxy  galaxy and mass  mass correlation functions are related in the linear regime via ( r ) = b^2 ( r ) , [ eq : xi ] where the biasing parameter @xmath26 is a constant independent of scale @xmath27 . however , a much more specific linear biasing model is often assumed in common applications , in which the local density fluctuation fields of galaxies and mass are assumed to be deterministically related via the relation ( ) = b ( ) .",
    "[ eq : linear ] note that follows from , but the reverse is not true .",
    "the deterministic linear biasing model is not a viable model .",
    "it is based on no theoretical motivation .",
    "if @xmath28 , it must break down in deep voids because values of @xmath22 below @xmath29 are forbidden by definition . even in the simple case of no evolution in comoving galaxy number density , the linear biasing relation is not preserved during the course of fluctuation growth .",
    "non - linear biasing , where @xmath26 varies with @xmath2 , is inevitable .    indeed ,",
    "the theoretical analysis of the biasing of collapsed halos versus the underlying mass ( mo & white 1996 ) , using the extended press - schechter approximation ( bond 1991 ) , predicts that the biasing is nonlinear and provides a useful approximation for its behavior as a function of scale , time and mass threshold .",
    "@xmath30-body simulations provide a more accurate description of the nonlinearity of halo biasing ( see figure  [ fig:1 ] ; somerville 1998 ) , and show that the model of mo & white is a good approximation . we provide more details about theoretical , numerical and observational constraints on the exact shape of nonlinear biasing in   [ sec : constraints ] , where we estimate the magnitude of nonlinear biasing effects .",
    "it is important to realize that once the biasing is nonlinear at one smoothing scale , the smoothing operation acting on the density fields guarantees that the biasing at any other smoothing scale obeys a different functional form of @xmath31 and is also non - deterministic .",
    "thus , any deviation from the simplified linear biasing model must also involve both scale - dependence and scatter .",
    "the focus of this paper is therefore on the consequences of the stochastic properties of the biasing process , which could either be related to the nonlinearity as mentioned above , or arise from other sources of scatter .",
    "an obvious part of this stochasticity can be attributed to the discrete sampling of the density field by galaxies  the shot noise .",
    "in addition , a statistical , physical scatter in the efficiency of galaxy formation as a function of @xmath2 is inevitable in any realistic scenario .",
    "it is hard to believe that the sole property affecting the efficiency of galaxy formation is the underlying mass density at a certain smoothing scale ( larger than the scale of galaxies ) .",
    "for example , the random variations in the density on smaller scales is likely to be reflected in the efficiency of galaxy formation . as another example",
    ", the local geometry of the background structure , via the deformation tensor , must play a role too . in this case , the three eigenvalues of the deformation tensor are relevant parameters .",
    "such hidden variables would show up as physical scatter in the density - density relation .",
    "a similar scatter is noticeable in the distribution of particular morphological types versus the underlying total galaxy distribution ( lahav & saslaw 1992 ) .",
    "the hidden scatter is clearly seen for halos in simulations including gravity alone (   [ sec : constraints ] below and figure  [ fig:1 ] based on somerville ( 1998 ) even before the more complex processes involving gas dynamics , star formation and feedback affect the biasing and in particular its scatter .    in practice , there are two alternative options for dealing with the shot noise component of the scatter",
    ". in some cases one can estimate the shot noise and try to remove it prior to the analysis of measuring @xmath13 .",
    "this is sometimes difficult , , because of the finite extent of the galaxies which introduces anti - correlations on small scales .",
    "the shot noise is especially large and hard to estimate in the case where the biasing refers to light density rather than number density .",
    "the alternative is to treat the shot noise as an intrinsic part of the local stochasticity of the biasing relation without trying to separate it from the physical scatter .",
    "the formalism developed below is valid in either case .    in ",
    "[ sec : local ] we present the biasing formalism , separate the effects of nonlinear biasing and stochastic biasing , and apply the formalism to measurements involving local second - order moments of @xmath2 and @xmath22 . in   [ sec : cor ] we derive relations for two - point correlation functions in the presence of local biasing scatter . in   [ sec : dist ] we apply the formalism to the analysis of redshift distortions . in ",

    "the concept of galaxy biasing is meaningful only for smoothing scales larger than the comoving scale of individual galaxies , namely a few mpc .",
    "an example would thus be a top - hat window of radius @xmath36 , for which the rms fluctuations of optical galaxies is about unity .",

    "as can be seen from the definitions of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , this measure is independent of the stochasticity of the biasing .",
    "it thus allows one to maintain general nonlinearity while addressing stochasticity .",

    "if the biasing conditional distribution , @xmath59 , is a gaussian [ still allowing @xmath31 and @xmath5 to vary with @xmath2 ] , then the first- and second - order moments fully characterize the biasing relation .",

    "<S> we propose a general formalism for galaxy biasing and apply it to methods for measuring cosmological parameters , such as regression of light versus mass , the analysis of redshift distortions , measures involving skewness and the cosmic virial theorem . the common linear and deterministic relation @xmath0 between the density fluctuation fields of galaxies @xmath1 and mass @xmath2 is replaced by the conditional distribution @xmath3 of these random fields , smoothed at a given scale at a given time . the nonlinearity is characterized by the conditional mean @xmath4 , while the local scatter is represented by the conditional variance @xmath5 and higher moments . </S>",
    "<S> the scatter arises from hidden factors affecting galaxy formation and from shot noise unless it has been properly removed .    for applications involving second - order local moments , </S>",
    "<S> the biasing is defined by three natural parameters : the slope @xmath6 of the regression of @xmath1 on @xmath2 , a nonlinearity @xmath7 , and a scatter @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of variances @xmath9 and the correlation coefficient @xmath10 mix these parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the nonlinearity and the scatter lead to underestimates of order @xmath11 and @xmath12 in the different estimators of @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the nonlinear effects are typically smaller .    </S>",
    "<S> local stochasticity affects the redshift - distortion analysis only by limiting the useful range of scales , especially for power spectra . in this range , for linear stochastic biasing </S>",
    "<S> , the analysis reduces to kaiser s formula for @xmath6 ( not @xmath15 ) , independent of the scatter . </S>",
    "<S> the distortion analysis is affected by nonlinear properties of biasing but in a weak way .    </S>",
    "<S> estimates of the nontrivial features of the biasing scheme are made based on simulations and toy models , and strategies for measuring them are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> they may partly explain the range of estimates for @xmath13 .    </S>",
