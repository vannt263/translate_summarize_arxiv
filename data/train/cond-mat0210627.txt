    "the calculation of non - zero - temperature and dynamical properties , such as magnetic transition temperatures and conductivities , is a long - standing and difficult problem in materials theory , but one for which the recent theoretical development of the dynamical mean field method @xcite offers a promising avenue for progress . this method , which allows an exact ( in principle ) treatment of local correlations has been recently used in combination with ab initio band calculations to estimate the transition temperatures of @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xcite , and in combination with a tight binding parametrization of band theory to elucidate the physics of the colossal magnetoresistance manganites @xcite and models of magnetic semiconductors @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we apply the method to study ferrimagnetic members of the double perovskite family of materials .",
    "these are compounds of chemical formula @xmath3 , with @xmath4 an alkaline earth such as @xmath5 , @xmath6 or @xmath7 , and @xmath8 two different transition metal ions . in the ferrimagnets of present interest the @xmath9 site is occupied by @xmath1 and @xmath10 site by a member of the @xmath11 or @xmath12 transition metal series such as @xmath13 or @xmath14 .",
    "the double perovskite family of materials have long been known @xcite but the ferrimagetic members listed above have become the subject of recent interest @xcite because they seem to be to be metallic ( except perhaps in the @xmath6 case @xcite ferrimagnets with magnetic transition temperatures greater than room temperature and apparently highly spin - polarized conduction bands , raising the possibility of interesting device applications as spin valves @xcite , elements in magnetic information storage systems @xcite and as sources of spin polarized electrons for spintronic applications @xcite .",
    "the materials are also of fundamental interest , because their physics and materials science are far from understood .",
    "for example , apparently minor changes in chemical composition or processing conditions can change the electrical behavior from metallic to insulating , or the magnetic transition temperature from @xmath15 to @xmath16 .",
    "more generally , the materials provide examples of novel behaviors associated with partial filling of transition metal @xmath17 shells , which have been little studied in comparison to the @xmath18 transition metal series @xcite .",
    "further , the specific materials we wish to study are believed to be half metallic ferrimagnets , but the obvious strong interaction which could give rise to half metallicity ( a hunds coupling on the @xmath1 ) exists on only one of the two sites , unlike the situation in the somewhat analogous cmr materials .",
    "thus behavior arising from the interplay of magnetic order and carrier motion may be different .",
    "finally , the origin of the magnetism is not settled .",
    "a natural guess is that it is due to the strong hunds coupling on the @xmath1 site , but other interactions have been proposed to be important @xcite    in this paper we present a model for the low ( less than , say @xmath19 ) lying electronic states , which are important for transport and magnetism .",
    "our model consists of a tight binding description of the bands , which we derive from previously published first principles calculations @xcite and general arguments , and a local interaction ( namely a hunds coupling on the @xmath1 site ) .",
    "the key physical assumption made in our model is that the magnetism is driven by the strong hunds coupling on the @xmath1 site .",
    "important technical issues include the two dimensional nature of the underlying band structure and the multiorbital nature of the material .",
    "we solve the model in the dynamical mean field approximation , and from our solution determine the magnetic transition temperature and optical conductivity , and attempt to determine the general materials aspects which control @xmath20 .",
    "this paper supercedes a previous paper @xcite , in which the model hamiltonian used did not provide an adequate approximation to the underlying band structure .",
    "double perovskite systems form in the @xmath3 crystal structure which generalizes the @xmath21 perovskite structure familiar from ferroelectrics , high temperature superconductors and the colossal magnetoresistance rare earth manganites by having two different @xmath9 site ions . in the double perovskite materials of interest here ,",
    "@xmath4 is an alkaline earth such as @xmath5 , @xmath6 or @xmath7 and the @xmath8 sites form a rocksalt structure , i.e. a simple cubic lattice with a doubled unit cell and one sublattice occupied by @xmath1 and the other by a transition metal from the @xmath11 or @xmath12 series such as @xmath14 or @xmath13 . the crystal fields and atomic energetics are such that the formal valences correspond to @xmath1 with a half filled , maximally polarized @xmath22-shell while the @xmath23 has one or two d electrons distributed over the @xmath24 levels @xcite .",
    "we will focus on electronic states arising from the transition metal d - levels .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the low lying , electronically active degrees of freedom may be written as the sum of a hopping part arising from the band structure and an interaction part : @xmath25 the relevant portions of the calculated @xcite band structure involve three bands ( degenerate in the ideal double perovskite structure ) arising from the three transition metal @xmath24 levels @xmath26 to a high degree of accuracy these three bands do not hybridize with each other and the physics is therefore described by a three - fold degenerate tight binding model .",
    "the planar character of the @xmath24 levels implies that the tight binding model has an interesting two dimensionality , which may be summarized as follows .",
    "the @xmath27 orbital on a @xmath1 site hybridizes via a matrix element @xmath28 with the @xmath27 levels on the four nearest neighbor ( @xmath29 ) , sites _ in the same plane _ and via a much smaller matrix element @xmath30 to the four nearest @xmath1 ions also in the same plane .",
    "the hopping in the third direction is negligible , because of the planar character and @xmath31 orbital symmetry of the @xmath27 wave function .",
    "the @xmath27 orbital on a @xmath23 site hybridizes with the four in - plane near neighbor @xmath1 sites via the same hopping matrix element @xmath28 and with the four in - plane second nearest neighbor ( @xmath32 sites , via another matrix element @xmath33 which is not particularly small , because of the more spatially extended character of the @xmath22-electrons in @xmath17 orbitals .",
    "further neighbor hoppings are also found to be important in other @xmath24-based @xmath11 systems such as @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "it is natural to assume that the magnetic character of the material derives from the strongly magentic nature of the @xmath1 ion and we therefore assume that the dominant interaction arises from the strong atomic hunds coupling of the @xmath1 .",
    "to write the hamiltonian explicitly we focus the cubic lattice of @xmath8 sites in the underlying single perovskite structure , labelling these sites by @xmath35 and the operator creating an electron into orbital @xmath36 and spin @xmath37 by @xmath38 .",
    "although we refer to this orbital as a @xmath39-orbital it in fact represents a hybrid , composed mainly of transition metal @xmath22 and oxygen @xmath40 orbitals , of the correct local symmetry . we introduce a nearest neighbor ( @xmath41 ) hopping @xmath28 and two second neighbor ( same sublattice ) hoppings @xmath42 and @xmath30 representing @xmath43 or @xmath44 hoppings respectively .",
    "as noted above we expect that @xmath42 corresponding to to @xmath43 hopping is relatively large , because of the larger spatial extent of the @xmath17 orbitals while @xmath30 is essentially negligible . to obtain the conductivity we couple in the electric field by using a vector potential and the peierls phase ansatz .",
    "this approximation has been shown to be accurate in other transition metal oxide contexts @xcite.thus the hopping portion of the hamiltonian is the sum of three identical tight binding models , one for each orbital .",
    "the hamiltonians take the general form ( note that the first sum runs over all lattice sites , the second over the @xmath45 ( non - fe ) and the third over the b ( fe ) sites , while @xmath46 labels the in - plane direction relevant to orbital @xmath47 and we have set the electric charge @xmath48 and the speed of light @xmath49 equal to unity ) @xmath50    @xmath51 implies an interesting band structure , which is most plainly revealed by writing @xmath51 in momentum space in a matrix notation where the upper left entry corresponds to @xmath1 and the lower right to @xmath14 , thus if @xmath52 we have , for the @xmath31 orbitals @xmath53= \\label { hbandxy}\\\\ & \\left ( \\begin{array } [ c]{cc}%   0 & -2t_{1}\\left (   \\cos p_{x}+\\cos p_{y}\\right )   \\\\ -2t_{1}\\left (   \\cos p_{x}+\\cos p_{y}\\right )    & -4t_{2}\\cos p_{x}\\cos p_{y}% \\end{array }   \\right ) \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have set the @xmath54 distance to unity and the momenta are restricted to the reduced brillouin zone @xmath55      the most important interaction effect constrains the occupancy of the @xmath9 ( @xmath56 site .",
    "the formal valence of @xmath1 is @xmath57 and the strong hunds coupling characteristic of @xmath1 ( and found in the local spin density approximation to band theory ) means that in the @xmath58 configuration all of the @xmath1 @xmath22-electrons are aligned , leading to a filled , completely spin - polarized @xmath22-shell .",
    "two charge fluctuation processes are possible : @xmath59 or @xmath60 the strongly stable nature of the filled d - shell implies that the @xmath61 process is dominant . to express this physics",
    "we introduce a strong hunds coupling on the @xmath9 ( @xmath1 ) site , expressing the fact that in the ground state the @xmath1 is in the @xmath57 maximal spin configuration , and an energy splitting parameter @xmath62 expressing the differing electronegativities of the @xmath9 and @xmath45 sites .",
    "thus we write @xmath63 for the calculations presented in this paper we will specialize to cubic symmetry ,",
    "so the @xmath62 are the same for all three orbitals , but this restriction may easily be lifted .",
    "the energy scale relevant for the @xmath60 valence fluctuation is @xmath64 examination of published band structures @xcite indicates that @xmath65 while the @xmath66 process has a much larger energy of @xmath67 in a fully spin polarized ground state , the interaction terms simply become level shifts , @xmath68 and @xmath69 for the majority and minority spin bands .",
    "transitions onto the majority - spin @xmath1 orbital involve very large energies , so to simplify the calculations at @xmath70 we will take the limit @xmath71 with @xmath72 fixed .",
    "we henceforth refer to the quantity @xmath72 as @xmath62 . because the local spin density approximation may not be accurate for strongly interacting systems such as the double perovskites , we will consider a range of @xmath62 here .",
    "other authors @xcite have argued that an additional hunds - type coupling on the @xmath45 site is important .",
    "technical limitations prevent us from treating such an interaction accurately , so we do not include it here .",
    "eq [ hbandxy ] may be thought of as describing two bands of electrons : one on the @xmath1 sites , with intrinsic bandwidth set by @xmath30 and one on the non-@xmath1 sites , with intrinsic bandwidth set by @xmath42 .",
    "the two bands hybridize via the overlap @xmath73 .",
    "we see immediately that the hybridization vanishes along the line @xmath74 which also contains the van hove points @xmath75 and @xmath76 at which the density of states of the two individual bands diverges . near these points",

    "comparison of this density of states to the published band theory results @xcite shows that these parameters reproduce the band density of states accurately .",
    "the main difference is that if the @xmath83 and @xmath62 are adjusted to correctly reproduce the minority spin band , then the upper ( non-@xmath1-portion of the majority spin band is positioned about @xmath84 too low in energy .",
    "the extra shift in the majority spin @xmath14 orbitals must be attributed to a hunds coupling on the non - fe site , not included here .",
    "the two features seen in our calculated density of states near @xmath84 arise from  states in the vicinity of the van hove points @xmath85 and @xmath86 where the hybridization vanishes and the @xmath9 and @xmath45 sites have energy @xmath87 and @xmath88 respectively@xmath89 whereas the peak at @xmath90 arises from the van hove point @xmath91 of the @xmath45 ( non - fe ) band , where as noted above the hybridization to the @xmath1 vanishes .",
    "formal valence arguments indicate that the material contains one or two d - electrons beyond the filled shell @xmath92 @xmath93 configuration .",
    "fig 1 shows that for the band theory parameters , these carriers go into states with only a small admixture of @xmath1 .",
    "the physics behind this result is that for this sign of @xmath94 the strongly hybridized states near @xmath95 are at the bottom of the band described by the @xmath96only term in @xmath51 , and are pushed further away from the @xmath1 states by usual level repulsion , leading to a mainly non - fe character of the lowest states . for @xmath97 ( @xmath13 ) only the minority spin band is occupied ( the majority spins occupy low - lying @xmath1 states off of the plotted scale ) .",

    "to evaluate the properties of @xmath117 we use the dynamical mean field method @xcite this method is extensively described and justified elsewhere , and is relevant here because the principal interactions are local . in brief the central approximation",
