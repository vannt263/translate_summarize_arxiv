    "excitons in semiconductor crystals @xcite and nanostructures @xcite,@xcite are a very interesting and challenging object to search for the process of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) .",
    "nowadays there is a lot of experimental evidence that the optically inactive para - excitons in cu@xmath0o can form a highly correlated state , or the excitonic bose einstein condensate @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "a moving condensate of para - excitons in a 3d cu@xmath0o crystal turns out to be spatially inhomogeneous in the direction of motion , and the registered velocities of coherent exciton packets turn out to be always less , but approximately equal to the longitudinal sound speed of the crystal @xcite .    analyzing recent experimental @xcite,@xcite,@xcite and theoretical @xcite-@xcite studies of bec of excitons in cu@xmath1o , we can conclude that there are essentially two different stages of this process .",
    "the first stage is the kinetic one , with the characteristic time scale of @xmath2ns . at this stage ,",
    "a condensate of long - living para - excitons begins to be formed from a quasi - equilibrium degenerate state of excitons ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) when the concentration and the effective temperature of excitons in a cloud meet the conditions of bose - einstein condensation @xcite .",
    "note that we do not discuss here the behavior of ortho - excitons ( with the lifetime @xmath5ns ) and their influence on the para - exciton condensation process . for more details about the ortho - excitons in cu@xmath1o , ortho - para - exciton conversion , etc .",
    "see @xcite,@xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the most intriguing feature of the kinetic stage is that formation of the para - exciton condensate and the process of momentum transfer to the para - exciton cloud are happening simultaneously .",
    "if the diameter of an excitation spot on the crystal surface is large enough , @xmath6 , and the energy of a laser beam satisfies @xmath7 , nonequilibrium acoustic phonons may play the key role in the process of momentum transfer . as a result , the mode with macroscopical occupancy of the excitons appears to be with @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the packet velocity .",
    "indeed , the theoretical results obtained in the framework of the `` phonon wind '' model @xcite,@xcite and the experimental observations @xcite,@xcite,@xcite are the strong arguments in favor of this idea . to the authors knowledge , there are no realistic theoretical models of the kinetic stage of para - exciton condensate formation where quantum degeneracy of the appearing exciton state and possible coherence of nonequilibrium phonons pushing the excitons would be taken into account . indeed , the condensate formation and many other processes involving it are essentially nonliner ones .",
    "therefore , the condensate , or , better , the _ macroscopically occupied mode _ , can be different from @xmath11 , and the language of the states in @xmath12-space and their occupation numbers @xmath13 may be not relevant to the problem , see @xcite .    in this study , we will not explore the stage of condensate formation .",
    "instead , we investigate the second , quasi - equilibrium stage , in which the condensate has already been formed and it moves through a crystal with some constant velocity and characteristic shape of the density profile . in theory ,",
    "the time scale of this `` transport '' stage , @xmath14 , could be determined by the para - exciton lifetime ( @xmath15s @xcite ) . in practice",
    ", it is determined by the characteristic size @xmath16 of a high - quality single crystal available for experiments : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the longitudinal sound velocity .",
    "we assume that at the `` transport '' stage , the temperature of the moving packet ( condensed@xmath19noncondensed particles ) is approximately equal to the lattice temperature , @xmath20 then we can consider the simplest case of @xmath21 and disregard the influence of all sorts of _ nonequilibrium _ phonons ( which appear at the stages of exciton formation , thermalization @xcite ) on the formed moving condensate .",
    "any theory of the exciton bec in cu@xmath0o has to point out some physical mechanism(s ) by means of which the key experimental facts can be explained .",
    "( for example , the condensate moves without friction within a narrow interval of velocities localized near @xmath18 , and the shape of the stable macroscopic wave function of excitons resembles soliton profiles @xcite . ) here we explore a simple model of the ballistic exciton - phonon condensate . in this case , the general structure of the hamiltonian of the moving exciton packet and the lattice phonons is the following : @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the bose - field operator describing the excitons , @xmath24 is the field operator of lattice displacements , @xmath25 is the momentum density operator canonically conjugate to @xmath24 , and @xmath26 is the momentum operator .",
    "note that the hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) is written in the reference frame moving with the exciton packet , i.e. @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the ballistic velocity of the packet .",
    "to derive the equations of motion of the field operators ( and generalize these equations to the case of @xmath29 ) , it is more convenient to start from the lagrangian . in the proposed model , the lagrangian density has the following form in the co - moving frame @xmath30 @xmath31 - _ g^ - ^2 ^ - _ 0 ( ^(*x*,t))^2 ( ( * x*,t))^2 - _ 1(^ ( * x*,t))^3((*x*,t))^3 + @xmath32 + ( _ t)^2 -c_l^2 ( _ j_s)^2 -c_l^2_3 ( _ j_s)^3 -(_t_x + _ x _ t ) + v^2(_x)^2- @xmath31 @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the exciton `` bare''mass ( @xmath35 for @xmath36s excitons in cu@xmath0o ) , @xmath37 is the exciton - exciton interaction constant ( @xmath38 corresponds to the repulsive interaction between para - excitons in cu@xmath0o @xcite ) , @xmath39 is the crystal density , @xmath40 is the exciton - longitudinal phonon coupling constant , and @xmath41 .",
    "the energy of a free exciton is @xmath42 .",
    "although the validity of the condition @xmath43 ( @xmath44 is the exciton bohr radius ) makes it possible to disregard all the multiple - particle interactions with more than two participating particles in @xmath45 @xcite , we include the hard - core repulsion term originated from the three - particle interaction in @xmath46 , i.e. @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( for 3d case , one has to take @xmath49 because @xmath50 and @xmath51 ; see the discussion in @xcite . )",
    "moreover , in the lagrangian of the displacement field , we include the first nonlinear term @xmath52 .",
    "( the dimensionless parameter @xmath53 originates from taylor s expansion of an interparticle potential @xmath54 of the medium atoms . ) assuming that a dilute excitonic packet moves in a weekly nonlinear medium , we will not take into account more higher nonlinear terms in ( [ lagrangian ] ) .    for simplicity s sake",
    ", we take all the interaction terms in @xmath55 in the _ local _ form and disregard the interaction between the excitons and transverse phonons of the crystal . note",
    "that the ballistic velocity @xmath10 is one of the parameters of the theory , and we will not take into account the excitonic normal component and velocity , i.e. @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",
    "this means that we choose the spatial part of the coherent phase of the packet , @xmath58 , to be in the simplest form , @xmath59    the equations of motion can be easily derived by the standard variational method from the following condition : @xmath60 indeed , after transforming the bose - fields @xmath61 and @xmath23 by @xmath62 we can write these equations as follows : @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65    we assume that the condensate of excitons _ exists_.",
    "this means that the following representation of the exciton bose - field holds : @xmath66 . here",
    "@xmath67 is the classical part of the field operator @xmath23 or , in other words , the condensate wave function , and @xmath68 is the fluctuational part of @xmath23 , which describes out - of - condensate particles .",
    "one of the important objects in the theory of bec is the correlation functions of bose - fields . the standard way to calculate them in this model ( the excitonic function @xmath69 , for example , )",
    "can be based on the effective action or the effective hamiltonian approaches @xcite .",
    "indeed , one can , first , integrate over the phonon variables @xmath70 , get the expression for @xmath71 and , second , use @xmath72 ( or @xmath73 ) to derive the equations of motion for @xmath74 , @xmath68 , correlation functions , etc ..    in this work we do not follow that way ; instead , we treat excitons and phonons equally @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "this means that the displacement field @xmath24 can have a nontrivial coherent part too , i.e. @xmath75 and @xmath76 , and the actual moving condensate can be an exciton - phonon one , i.e. @xmath77 . then the equation of motion for the classical parts of the fields @xmath23 and @xmath24 can be derived by use of the variational method from @xmath78 , in which all the fields can be considered as the classical ones .",
    "eventually we have @xmath79 @xmath80 @xmath81 notice that deriving these equations we disregarded the interaction between the classical ( condensate ) and the fluctuational ( noncondensate ) parts of the fields .",
    "that is certainly a good approximation for @xmath21 and @xmath82 cases @xcite .    in this article , a steady - state of the condensate",
    "is the object of the main interest . in the co - moving frame of reference , the condensate steady - state is just the stationary solution of eqs .",
    "( [ eq11]),([eq22 ] ) and it can be taken in the form @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the real number functions , and @xmath86 is the coherent phase of the condensate wave function in the co - moving frame , see eq .",
    "( [ superf ] ) .",
    "( this phase can be taken equal zero if only a single condensate is the subject of interest . )",
    "then , the following equations have to be solved , ( @xmath87 ) : @xmath88 @xmath89 note that in order to simplify eq .",
    "( [ eq22 ] ) to eq .",
    "( [ eq222 ] ) , we assumed only @xmath90 . in this model ,",
    "it is enough to obtain localized solutions for the displacement field .",
    "solving eqs . ( [ eq111]),([eq222 ] ) in 3d space seems to be a difficult problem .",
    "however , these equations can be essentially simplified if we assume that the condensate is inhomogeneous along the @xmath91-axis only , that is @xmath92 note that the cross - section area of an excitation spot , @xmath93 , has to be basically constant across the sample cross - section . in this case , the problem can be considered as an effectively one - dimensional one .",
    "such an effective reduction of dimensionality transforms difficult ( nonlocal differential ) equations for the condensate wave function into a rather simple differential ones , and obtained in this way the effective 1d model for the condensate wave function @xmath94 conserves all the important properties of the `` parent '' 3d model .",
    "indeed , if @xmath95 , the following equations stand for the condensate ( @xmath96 ) : @xmath97 @xmath98 the last equation can be easily integrated , @xmath99 and solved relative to @xmath100 . here",
    "@xmath101 note that the medium nonlinearity parameter @xmath53 can be enhanced by the factor of the order of @xmath102 if the value of @xmath10 is less , but close to @xmath18 .",

    "if @xmath107 , we can always represent the solution of ( [ 11deq]),([11deqd ] ) in the following form @xmath108 ( indeed , the parameters of medium nonlinearity can be chosen as @xmath107 and @xmath109 @xcite . ) after substitution of ( [ dc ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ 1deq ] ) , eqs .",
    "( [ 1deq ] ) , ( [ 11deq ] ) can be rewritten as follows : @xmath110 @xmath111 where the interparticle interaction constants are renormalized as follows @xmath112 and more higher nonlinear terms are designated by @xmath113 . a small parameter in eq .",
    "( [ kappa ] ) comes from the term @xmath114 where @xmath115 and @xmath116 is the mass of the crystal elementary cell .",
    "the effective two - particle interaction constant @xmath117 can be * negative * if the velocity of the condensate lies inside the interval @xmath118 , where @xmath119 outside this interval , @xmath120 @xcite and the velocity @xmath121 can be called the first ` critical ' velocity in the model .",
    "the meaning of this velocity can be clarified by rewriting ( [ kappa ] ) in the dimensionless form , @xmath122 if @xmath123 , @xmath124 where @xmath125 and @xmath126 are the characteristic energy and the cross - section of two - particle collisions in the exciton subsystem .",
    "the following inequalities are true for excitons in a crystal @xmath127 and , usually , the value of the parameter @xmath128 is @xmath129 .    for para - excitons in cu@xmath00",

    "this makes the inequality ( [ negative ] ) valid at , say , @xmath133 , or @xmath134 .",
    "thus , within the effective 1d model , the critical factor @xmath135 is the following ratio @xmath136 and , for the substances with @xmath137 , the regime with @xmath138 can be obtained at velocities _ reasonably close _ but not equal to @xmath18 , for example , beginning from some @xmath139 , ( @xmath140 ) .    on the other hand , the effective three - particle interaction constant @xmath141 is always positive for crystals with @xmath142 .",

    "the effective vertex @xmath146 is enhanced by the medium nonlinearity , and the both terms in the r.h.s . of ( [ three - part ] ) can be equally important at @xmath147 .",
    "note that in the case of _ strongly nonlinear lattices _ with excitons , the effective interaction vertices in ( [ 1deqmod ] ) ( @xmath148 , @xmath149 , etc . ) depend on the velocity @xmath10 and the parameters of medium nonlinearity ( @xmath53 , @xmath150 , etc . ) .",
    "then the effective exciton - exciton interaction can be strongly renormalized at sufficiently large gamma - factors @xmath151 and the vertices may change their signs as it can happen with @xmath117 . in this article , however , we consider the case of _ weakly nonlinear medium _ with excitons ( e.g. , a crystal with long living excitons ) . more accurately , this means that at velocities @xmath152 the effective vertex @xmath117 became @xmath153 , while the more higher vertices , such as @xmath154 and @xmath155 , do not change their sign ; they remain @xmath156 at @xmath157 .",

    "( [ energy ] ) , ( generally , @xmath631 ) .",
    "moreover , we have to assume that the total momentum of the condensates , @xmath632 , may not be conserved because of lattice participation in such a condensate `` merger '' .",
    "however , the challenging question of the results of coherent packet collision needs further theoretical and experimental efforts .",
    "in this study , we considered a model within which the inhomogeneous excitonic _ condensate _ with a nonzero momentum can be investigated .",
    "the important physics we include in our model is the exciton - phonon interaction and the appearance of a coherent part of the crystal displacement field , which renormalizes the x - x interaction vertices .",
    "then , the condensate wave function and its energy can be calculated exactly in the simplest quasi-1d model , and the solution is a sort of davydov s soliton @xcite .",
    "we believe that the transport and other unusual properties of the coherent para - exciton packets in cu@xmath0o can be described in the framework of the proposed model properly generalized to meet more realistic conditions .",
    "we showed that there are two critical velocities in the theory , namely , @xmath121 and @xmath580 .",
    "the first one , @xmath121 , comes from the renormalization of two particle exciton - exciton interaction due to phonons , and the bright soliton state can be formed if @xmath595 .",
    "then , the important parameter , which controls the shape and the characteristic width of the condensate wave function , is @xmath633 , see eqs .",
    "( [ mu1]),([need2 ] ) .",
    "the second velocity , @xmath580 , comes from use of landau arguments @xcite for investigation of the dynamic stability / instability of the moving condensate .",
    "in fact , the important parameter , which controls the emission of excitations , is @xmath634 , see eq .",
    "( [ cr_mu ] ) .",
    "then , within the semiclassical approximation for the condensate excitations , we found more close @xmath10 is to @xmath18 ( @xmath635 ) more stable the coherent packet is .",
    "it is interesting to discuss the possibility of observation of an instability when the condensate can be formed in the inhomogeneous state with @xmath636 , but with @xmath637 , or , better , @xmath638 .",
    "such a coherent packet has to disappear during its move through a single pure crystal used for experiments .",
    "as the shape of the moving packet depends on time , the form of the registered signal may depend on the crystal length changing from the solitonic to the standard diffusion density profile .",
    "we found that the excited states of the moving exciton - phonon condensate can be described by use of the language of elementary excitations .",
    "although the possibility of their direct observation is an unclear question itself ( and , thus , the question about the gap in the excitation spectrum is still an open one ) , the stability conditions of the moving condensate can be derived from the low - energy asymptotics of the excitation spectra at @xmath345 .",
    "however , the stability problem is not without difficulties @xcite,@xcite .",
    "one can easily imagine the situation when the condensate moves in a very high quality crystal , but with some impurity region prepared , f.ex .",
    ", in the middle of the sample . in this case , the excitonic superfluidity can be examined by impurity scattering of the ballistic condensate . indeed",
    ", such impurities could bound the noncondensed excitons , which always accompany the condensate , and could mediate , for instance , the emission of the outside excitations .",
    "the last process may lead to depletion of the condensate and , perhaps , some other observable effects , such as damping , bound exciton pl , etc ..",
