    "in 1988 , becklin & zuckerman announced the discovery of the coolest dwarf star yet seen .",
    "imaged with the first generation of infrared cameras , this companion to the white dwarf gd165 went without proper classification for several years .",
    "the l dwarf prototype , gd165b came to represent the first new class of main sequence stars in 100 years , a class believed to retain both stellar and substellar objects over the age of the galaxy @xcite . since that time , over two hundred and fifty objects of this spectral type have been discovered .",
    "rather ubiquitous in the field and in young clusters , l dwarfs have remained relatively infrequent companions to stars with @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "understanding the overall statistics and individual properties of the lowest mass companion systems is important for both star and planet formation .",
    "this paper describes the properties of a very cool companion to the white dwarf gd1400 ( wd0145 - 221 , @xmath4 eq .",
    "j2000 ) . spectroscopic and photometric evidence is presented that indicates the presence of a low mass , l type dwarf within @xmath5 of the primary .",
    "optical @xmath6 band data were taken 3 january 2004 with the ccd camera on the nickel 1 meter telescope at lick observatory .",
    "gd1400 and a nearby tycho 2 catalog star ( tyc4688 - 111 - 1 ) were both observed for a total of 3 minutes , each in 3 separate 1 minute exposures , yielding @xmath7 on gd1400 and @xmath8 on the @xmath9 mag calibrator @xcite .",
    "conditions were clear but with poor seeing ( @xmath10 ) that appeared to remain relatively stable between target and calibrator observations .",
    "the individual frames were bias subtracted , flat fielded , registered and then averaged to create a single reduced image upon which to perform photometric measurements .",
    "photometry was executed with @xmath11 and @xmath12 diameter apertures on both gd1400 and calibrator , including telluric extinction corrections , producing consistent results to within @xmath13 mag .",
    "the error in the measured flux of each object was @xmath14 mag .",
    "the published uncertainty in the magnitude of tyc4688 - 111 - 1 is 0.12 mag @xcite .",
    "the result for gd1400 is @xmath15 mag .",
    "gd1400 was observed on 16 january 2004 , using the near infrared spectrograph ( nirspec , mclean et al .",
    "1998 ) at keck observatory .",
    "nirspec was used in low resolution mode with a @xmath17 slit , yielding a spectral resolution of @xmath18 .",
    "the seeing was poor during the observations ( @xmath19 at @xmath16 ) and the telescope suffered from significant windshake at the location of gd1400 , so no companion was resolved , nor was any elongation detected except due to the effects of windshake .",
    "two 10 minute spectra ( dithered by @xmath20 for sky subtraction ) were obtained in @xmath16 band using the n7 filter , which yielded a wavelength coverage of @xmath21 m .",
    "the observations had a fixed position angle on the sky of @xmath22 .",
    "hd63586 , an a0v star , was observed at similar airmass for atmospheric calibration .",
    "the spectrum of gd1400 was reduced using the redspec data reduction package .",
    "the images were cleaned of bad pixels , flat fielded , pair subtracted , and spatially rectified .",
    "two spectra of gd1400 were extracted , averaged , divided by the calibrator spectrum ( scaled by a blackbody ) , wavelength calibrated and normalized .",
    "the average of the two spectra is shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "an unresolved companion was suspected based on the optical and near infrared data available on gd1400 . in the following sections",
    ", evidence is presented that reveals a low mass companion causing excess emission at @xmath23 m .",
    "there exist two independent spectroscopic analyses of the hydrogen rich ( da ) white dwarf gd1400 . both @xcite and @xcite give results based on high resolution spectroscopy that agree quite well ; @xmath24 k , log @xmath25 and @xmath26 k , log @xmath27 respectively .",
    "the average and standard deviation of these two results ( @xmath28 k , log @xmath29 ) were used to predict model colors and absolute magnitudes , with errors , for gd1400 @xcite .    before considering distances and absolute magnitudes for gd1400b",
    ", the flux ratio of primary and secondary should be considered .",
    "based on the measured @xmath6 magnitude and the @xmath30 model predicted color for gd1400 , the predicted @xmath16 magnitude is @xmath31 mag ( model predicted color has less than 0.01 mag uncertainty and is essentially independent of surface gravity  the error is all measurement error in @xmath6 ) .",
    "the 2mass point source catalog gives a snr=19.2 measurement of @xmath32 mag for the composite pair .",
    "ignoring corrections between @xmath23 m filter sets , a deconvolved magnitude of @xmath33 mag is calculated for the companion . if the white dwarf models are accurate , the companion and primary appear equally luminous at this wavelength .",
    "there is little or no excess emission measured for gd1400 at @xmath34 m , which is consistent with a very red color of @xmath0 for its companion ( table [ tbl-1 ] ) ; consistent with a spectral type of l5.5 or later @xcite . within the uncertainties of the 2mass",
    "measured @xmath35 magnitude of the composite and the white dwarf model extrapolation , it is possible that the companion @xmath35 band flux is undetected .",
    "the radius of gd1400 , which has been determined spectroscopically by two independent measurements , can be used to estimate an absolute magnitude for gd1400b . at an assumed 39 pc photometric distance for gd1400 ( based on",
    "the model predicted absolute magnitude of @xmath36 mag for the white dwarf ) an absolute @xmath16 magnitude of @xmath37 mag is determined for the l dwarf companion .",
    "these data are most compatible with spectral type l6 and @xmath38 k for gd1400b @xcite .      coincidentally , the gd165 system ( da4.2+dl4 ) , which has a white dwarf primary with similar temperature and surface gravity to gd1400 , will serve as a useful guide and comparator for the following analysis .",
    "there are two independent spectroscopic parameter determinations for gd165 .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite give similar results ; @xmath39 k , log @xmath40 and @xmath41 k , log @xmath42 , respectively . also , gd165 has a trigonometric parallax which places it at 31.5 pc .",
    "the difference between the model predicted versus measured absolute magnitudes for gd165a are 0.06 mag at @xmath6 , 0.03 mag at @xmath35 and 0.04 mag at @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "hence the models appear quite accurate in this case .",
    "in contrast to the equally luminous components of the gd1400 system , gd165b is 0.41 mag brighter than its white dwarf primary at @xmath16 .",
    "provided that brown dwarfs and the lowest mass stars all have radii near @xmath43 after 1 gyr @xcite , gd1400b appears cooler than the l4 dwarf gd165b .",
    "the total @xmath35 band flux of the gd1400 system is consistent ( within the errors ) with a single star , yet the combined @xmath35 band flux of both components of the gd165 system is 0.29 mag brighter than the flux from the white dwarf alone @xcite . again , if the white dwarf and brown dwarf models used here are accurate , gd1400b appears to be cooler than gd165b .",
    "although this photometric evidence points to an object cooler than gd165b , there is still room for some error in the models and perhaps even in the spectroscopy of the primary white dwarf .",
    "the gd1400 system is unresolved and there currently exists no trigonometric parallax .      near infrared spectroscopy",
    "was performed to examine the possibility of a red background object or dust as the cause of the excess emission seen at @xmath23 m .",
    "the @xmath2 m spectrum of gd1400 is shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the two features seen at @xmath44 m and @xmath45 m are co bandheads , which are indicative of a low mass companion and readily visible in this composite spectrum . an 11,500 k blackbody spectrum , scaled to have exactly half the flux of the composite at @xmath46 m , was subtracted from the spectrum in figure [ fig1 ] , thus effectively removing the expected contribution from the featureless white dwarf at these wavelengths .",
    "the resulting spectrum is shown in figure [ fig2 ] .    in the subtracted spectrum ,",
    "both co bandheads have @xmath47 .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the equivalent widths of these features for several m and l dwarfs from @xcite together with gd1400b  all measured in a uniform way for this work .",
    "the equivalent widths for gd1400b appear stronger than those of known single l and m dwarfs .",
    "oversubtraction of the white dwarf continuum from the composite spectrum could , in principle , cause the measured co bandhead equivalent widths to be larger than their intrinsic values .",
    "another possibility is close binary interactions , such as heating of the companion by the white dwarf .",
    "further observations are necessary to reconcile this apparent anomaly .",
    "there is an absence of na at @xmath48 m , which can be seen weakly as late as spectral type l2 , but not later .",
    "equivalent widths vary between @xmath49  for early l dwarfs @xcite .",
    "a measurement of this region in the spectrum of gd1400b is consistent with an equivalent width of @xmath50  .",
    "the noise in the region from @xmath51 m is 0.040 flux units per resolution element and the na line typically has a full width of @xmath52  @xcite in late m dwarfs , or roughly 5 resolution elements of 2.6 pixels each .",
    "hence , an equivalent width as small as 1.0  could have been detected at the @xmath53 level .",
    "the lack of na is inconsistent with an m dwarf .",
    "the conclusion based on spectroscopy alone is that an early l type can not be ruled out with confidence .",
    "although the equivalent widths of the first and second co bandheads are larger than those seen in single l and late m dwarfs , this could be due to close binary interactions or model uncertainties which led to oversubtraction of the white dwarf flux .",
    "the fact that na is not manifest in the spectrum may be at odds with the co equivalent widths , but is consistent with the photometry .",
    "gd1400 , a @xmath54 white dwarf , has been cooling for 0.51 gyr according to models ( p. bergeron 2002 , private communication ) . from the initial to final mass relation for white dwarfs @xcite , a white dwarf with this mass has evolved from a main sequence progenitor with a mass in the range @xmath55 .",
    "the main sequence lifetime then falls within the range @xmath56 gyr @xcite , yielding a total age between @xmath57 gyr .",
    "the very moderate proper motion of gd1400 , @xmath58 @xcite , also supports the conclusion that this is a relatively young system . assuming @xmath59 , its galactic space velocity relative to the lsr is @xmath60 ( @xmath61 is taken to be positive toward the galactic anticenter , @xmath6 positive in the direction of galactic rotation , and @xmath62 positive toward the north galactic pole ) , with a total space motion of only @xmath63 with respect to the sun",
    " typical of young disk objects @xcite . at 1.25 gyr ,",
    "a @xmath38 k brown dwarf is predicted to have @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "the orbital separation of gd1400b is uncertain .",
    "the system remained unresolved in subsequent nirspec @xmath16 band images taken two weeks after the spectrum was obtained .",
    "the image with the best spatial resolution reveals a full width of @xmath65 and a sufficiently symmetric psf to rule out an equally luminous binary with separation @xmath66 .",
    "although there is the possibility of a chance alignment , the most likely explanation for the unresolved nature of the binary is a relatively small , @xmath67 au , semimajor axis .    during the agb phase of stellar evolution ,",
    "orbiting bodies outside of @xmath68 au should eschew the expanding envelope and eventually have their semimajor axes expanded by a factor ( typically 3 to 5 ) related to the mass lost @xcite . inside of @xmath68 au",
    ", a companion should inspiral due to tidal and frictional interaction with the slow agb wind and expanding photosphere @xcite .",
    "hence , it is likely that the semimajor axis of gd1400b s orbit is less than a few au .",
    "a sensitive search for radial velocity variations might be able to confirm or rule out a close binary system .",
    "based on photometric data presented here , the first unambiguous substellar companion to a white dwarf may have been discovered within @xmath5 ( @xmath69 au ) of gd1400 ( da4.4 ) .",
    "however , the near infrared spectroscopy may indicate a co temperature that is higher than the photospheric temperature indicated by the photometry",
    ". this could be the result of close binary interactions causing the co bandheads to appear more strongly than in isolated l dwarfs or may be due to errors in the models used to remove the flux of the primary .    from a direct comparison with the gd165 binary system ( relying on the same white dwarf and brown dwarf models )",
    ", it appears that gd1400b is cooler than spectral type l4 .",
    "the deconvolved magnitudes and colors of gd1400b are most consistent with spectral type l6 , indicative of a @xmath70 brown dwarf at an estimated age of 1.25 gyr .",
    "its true nature and origins remain uncertain until more is known about the binary system",
    ". a trigonometic parallax determination , radial velocity measurements , or very high resolution imaging should be able to further constrain the properties of this system .",
    "both authors owe a debt of gratitude to m. cushing for kindly providing us with his spectra for analysis here and to n. scoville for donating some of his keck nirspec time to observe gd1400 .",
    "j. farihi wishes to express sincere thanks to b. zuckerman for his assistance in acquiring the optical data , to e. gates of lick observatory for taking the optical data , to l. prato & m. mcgovern for securing follow up near infrared images and many helpful discussions , and to e. e. becklin & b. zuckerman for careful readings of the manuscript and constructive comments .",
