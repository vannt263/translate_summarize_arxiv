    "in present - day galaxies , it is known that more than half of main - sequence stars are found in binaries or low - order multiple systems not only for low - mass stars but also for massive stars ( e.g. , tohline 2002 ; kroupa 2004 ) . regarding the upper mass limit , a very massive binary of the order of @xmath2",
    "is found in the large magellanic cloud @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been revealed that the binary fraction of pre - main - sequence stars is comparable to that of main - sequence stars @xcite .",
    "this implies that binaries possibly form prior to the pre - main - sequence phase .",
    "recent studies on the formation of population iii stars have shown that the first stars in the universe are likely to be as massive as @xmath3 @xcite or to have formed in a bimodal initial mass function with peaks of @xmath4 and several @xmath2 @xcite . in light of present - day star formation ,",
    "a portion of population iii stars appear able to form in binary systems .",
    "population iii binaries could play an important role for the thermal history of the universe through the formation of massive binary black holes ( bhs ) , accreting binaries , and population iii type ia supernovae ( sne ) .",
    "for instance , the accreting binaries may emit ultraviolet radiation in a longer timescale than the lifetime of massive stars themselves and therefore can be a reionization source in the early universe @xcite .",
    "the binary formation for present - day stars has been studied through elaborate numerical simulations @xcite . however",
    ", no study has been made on the formation of population iii binaries .",
    "so far , studies of population iii protostars have focused on the core collapse of single stars which proceeds through the cooling by primordial hydrogen molecules @xcite .",
    "the previous studies imply that ( 1 ) the initial stellar core is on the order of @xmath5 , which is not so different from the present - day protostars , ( 2 ) the mass accretion rate is as high as a few tens of @xmath6 with the sound speed @xmath7 , which is numerically @xmath8 for @xmath9k gas because no coolant works to cool down to less than @xmath10k in primordial gas , and ( 3 ) the thermal history follows the evolution with an adiabatic exponent of @xmath11 until reaching the central density of @xmath12 , above which hydrogen molecules are dissociated and therefore the temperature increases with @xmath13 .    on the basis of these findings ,",
    "we study the formation of population iii binary stars .",
    "we perform a three - dimensional hydrodynamic simulation with nested grids in order to resolve the core collapse and the subsequent fragmentation . in the next section ,",
    "the numerical model is described . in  [ results ] , we present the numerical results for the collapse and fragmentation of population iii stellar core .  [ discussion ] is devoted to the discussion of the cosmological implications of population iii binaries .",
    "in the previous three - dimensional numerical simulations of the formation of population iii stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , filamentary structure commonly appears before it is broken into many pieces .",
    "hence , we consider a cylindrical cloud as the initial condition , in which the cloud is assumed to be in hydrostatic balance with the central temperature and density of @xmath14k and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "the equation of state is assumed to be polytropic with @xmath16 .",
    "the polytropic constant @xmath17 is proportional to @xmath18 and fixed to @xmath19 in si units throughout the calculation .",
    "therefore , if a different initial density is adopted , the temperature is scaled as @xmath20 .",
    "we add a 5% sinusoidal density fluctuation of one critical wavelength along the cylinder axis , above which the cylinder is gravitationally unstable .",
    "in addition , in the azimuthal direction , a perturbation of @xmath21 and 4 mode is blended with @xmath22 .",
    "the total mass for one critical wavelength is @xmath23 for the assumed initial density .",
    "we note that , since actual simulations are done with dimensionless units , the present model follows the scaling as @xmath24 for the system mass and @xmath25 for the linear size of computational domain .",
    "for instance , the numerical results can be translated into a massive case with @xmath26 and @xmath27 , if we renormalize the simulation by @xmath28 .",
    "the rotation of the initial cloud is specified by a model parameter @xmath1 , which is defined by the ratio of the centrifugal force to the pressure gradient force , i.e. , @xmath29 . for a given @xmath1 , the specific angular momentum at the outer boundary , @xmath30 ,",
    "is given by @xmath31^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath32 is the mass per unit length .",
    "we construct four models with different rotation of @xmath33 0.0 , 0.1 , 0.3 and 1.0 .",
    "the hydrodynamic evolution of the cloud is solved by a three - dimensional nested grid code , which is developed by @xcite . at the initial epoch",
    ", the cylinder is represented in @xmath34 grid points , assuming a mirror symmetry with respect to the equatorial plane .",
    "we introduce a new finer grid so that the resolution satisfies the condition that the half - width of the half - maximum density should be resolved with more than 8 grid points . here",
    "16 levels for nested grids are allowed , and therefore the final spatial resolution @xmath35 . here",
    "we set @xmath36au and therefore @xmath37au . the self - gravity is calculated self - consistently by solving the poisson equation with a multigrid iteration method @xcite .",
    "the numerical results can be divided into two cases of low and high @xmath1 cases . here , we show the typical results of these models .",
    "figure 1 shows the density distribution and velocity fields for a case of @xmath38 . at the initial stage ( fig .",
    "1a ) , the ratio of rotation energy @xmath39 to gravitational energy @xmath40 is as small as @xmath41 . the filamentary cloud fragments as a results of gravitational instability , and each fragment undergoes the runaway collapse . in early stages of runaway collapse , the dense cloud shrinks , keeping an approximately spherical shape .",
    "at the stage of @xmath42 @xmath43 , @xmath44 of spherical core reaches 0.245 because of the spin - up of the central cloud during the collapse .",
    "after that , the spherical collapsing core forms a runaway collapsing disk in the central region ( fig .",
    "when the cloud collapses near to the centrifugal barrier , a rotationally supported disk , the radius of which is @xmath45 au is formed ( fig .",
    "1c ) at the stage of @xmath46 @xmath43 .",
    "the formation of a rotationally - supported disk is an important consequence for the binary formation .",
    "if the equation of state is perfectly isothermal ( @xmath47 ) , the runaway collapse of a rotating cloud continues to form the central singularity without forming a rotationally supported disk @xcite .",
    "however , the present simulation shows that the runaway collapse stops before producing the central singularity in the case of @xmath48 .",
    "this is an essential difference between isothermal and @xmath48 evolution . after a rotationally",
    "supported disk forms , the envelope accretes onto the disk ( fig .",
    "1d ) . in this disk ,",
    "the toomre @xmath49 is slightly less than unity .",
    "however , the disk radius is smaller than the critical wavelength of ring instability .",
    "the disk is therefore stable at this stage .",
    "the disk radius and mass grow via accretion from the infalling envelope .",
    "when the radius increases up to 0.1 au , which is larger than the critical wavelength , the disk suffers from ring instability ( fig .",
    "the rotating ring is unstable against nonaxisymmetric modes , finally evolving into a binary core ( fig .",
    "the binary core separation is @xmath50au .",
    "the simulation was terminated just before the central density reaches @xmath51 .",
    "the subsequent equation of state is expected to deviate from @xmath48 to @xmath52 .",
    "when the binary core forms , the core mass is approximately @xmath53 .",
    "the binary core can continue to grow through further accretion .",
    "the accretion rate onto the binary system is @xmath54 .",
    "saigo & hanawa ( 1998 ) derived a larson - penston type accretion rate onto a disk as @xmath55 .",
    "the present accretion rate is comparable to this prediction for the temperature of @xmath56k which is attained by the stage of @xmath57 @xmath43 . except for the formation of a binary core , the mass accretion after core formation is likely to be similar to the case of a single population iii star @xcite .    for another low @xmath1 case",
    ", we have simulated a @xmath58 model as well . as a result",
    ", we have found that the dynamical evolution is very similar to the case of @xmath38 . eventually , a binary core forms .",
    "models with @xmath59 exhibit the evolution different from the low @xmath1 models described in the previous section .",
    "figure 2 shows the evolution of a high @xmath1 case . at the initial stage ( fig .",
    "2a ) , @xmath60 . the runaway collapse proceeds in a manner similar to the case of @xmath38 ( fig .",
    "2b ) . until a",
    "nearly spherical collapsing cloud forms , @xmath44 increases up to @xmath61 , owing to the enhanced rotation energy .",
    "then a bar mode structure emerges as shown in figure 2c , because the bar mode instability can set in when @xmath62 ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "simultaneously , the angular momentum is transferred by a bar mode , as studied by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the ambient matter accretes onto this bar ( fig .",
    "2d ) , but no ring forms owing to effective angular momentum transfer . as a result",
    ", the bar collapses into a denser bar ( fig .",
    "2e ) , eventually reaching stellar density of @xmath51 ( fig .",
    "2f ) without fragmenting into a multiple system .    to see the dependence on the initial perturbation",
    ", we ran simulations with @xmath63 , and 50% . as a result , we found that the final results are almost the same regardless of the initial perturbations .",
    "this is because the initial azimuthal perturbation is smoothed out in the course of the thermal history with @xmath48 .",
    "we have simulated the collapse of a rotating cylinder while assuming the primordial gas thermal history . as a result",
    ", we have found that to form a binary system , the formation of a rotationally supported disk is indispensable , which is realized only by a lower rotation parameter .",
    "the rotation - supported disk undergoes ring - mode instability , eventually fragmenting in to binary cores .",
    "in contrast , the case with a relatively high rotation parameter leads to a bar - mode instability and the angular momentum efficiently transferred by the bar , resulting in the collapse into a single stellar core .",
    "these results show that the initial conditions with less angular momentum are more prone to binary formation and therefore imply that a significant fraction of population iii stars are expected to form in binary systems .    in the present simulation ,",
    "we have started with high initial density .",
    "if we use the scaling for mass and linear size and renormalize the physical quantities by a lower initial density such as @xmath64 , then the simulation predicts the formation of a massive binary with several hundred @xmath65 and a separation of @xmath9au .",
    "@xcite showed that the mass of population iii stars could bifurcate according to the initial filament density .",
    "if the initial density is above the critical density of h@xmath66 molecules , @xmath67 , then the fragment mass is peaked around @xmath68 , whereas the peak is shifted to @xmath69 for @xmath64 .        1 .",
    "a star of @xmath73 evolves into a white dwarf after asymptotic giant branch mass loss .",
    "2 .   a star of @xmath74 results in a type ii sn .",
    "+ item a star of @xmath75 probably collapses into a bh .",
    "a star of @xmath76 is partly or completely disrupted by the electron - positron pair instability .",
    "4 .   a star with mass of @xmath77 collapses completely to a bh without ejecting any heavy elements .    combining such population iii stellar evolution with the present results",
    ", we may expect a wide variety of population iii binaries .",
    "if a binary is as massive as @xmath78 , it can result in a binary bh .",
    "recently , @xcite argued that a population iii binary bh could be the intensive gravitational wave burst sources , which may be detected by the laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory . if there is a slight mass difference in a massive binary , a system composed of a @xmath79 population iii star and several @xmath80 bhs may form .",
    "then the mass ejected from a massive star can accrete onto a companion bh , resulting in a possible source of ionizing radiation in the early universe @xcite .",
    "the population iii bh accretion may be an important clue for the early reionization that is suggested by the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ @xcite .",
    "if a low - mass population iii binary forms , population iii type ia sn might occur . in this case",
    ", heavy elements synthesized in a more rapidly evolving star can pollute a companion star by stellar wind .",
    "the evolution is likely to be sensitive to the metallicity - dependent opacity of accretion flow .",
    "population iii type ia sne seem worth studying in the future , because they may play an important role in the thermal history in the universe .",
    "we thank k. omukai , k. tomisaka , and t. tsuribe for stimulating discussion and t. hanawa for contribution to construction of the nested grid code .",
