    "the diffusion  reaction system with two initially separated diffusing particles of spices @xmath4 and @xmath5 reacting according to the formula @xmath6 has been intensively studied during past years @xcite . as the diffusion - reaction equations describing the system are nonlinear , it is difficult to solve them and their general solutions remain unknown ( except of very special cases ) .",
    "thus , to simplify the calculations one usually uses various approximations , such as the quasistationary approximation @xcite , the scaling method @xcite , or the perturbation one @xcite . using these methods , there were derived characteristic functions of the system which include : the time evolution of the reaction front @xmath7 , the width of the reaction zone @xmath8 or the width of the depletion zone @xmath9 @xcite which all appear to be the power functions of time @xmath10 .",
    "the results were confirmed by numerical calculations and simulations @xcite .",
    "however , as the methods of extracting the power functions are not based on analytical solutions of subdiffusion - reaction equations ( not even on their approximately forms ) the proportionality coefficient @xmath3 is unknown .",
    "the coefficient carries dynamical information about the system e.g. how the diffusion coefficient influences the process .",
    "as far as we know , there were only a few attempts to determine of @xmath3 by means of the quasistationary approximation @xcite .",
    "the situation is more complicated in the case of the subfiffusion system since the equations describing the system contain a derivative of fractional order .",
    "subdiffusion occurs in systems where mobility of particles is significantly hindered due to internal structure of the medium , as in porous media or gels @xcite .",
    "the subdiffusion is characterized by a time dependence of the mean square displacement of transported particle @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the subdiffusion coefficient measured in the units @xmath13 and @xmath2 is the subdiffusion parameter which obeys @xmath14 . for @xmath15 one deals with the normal diffusion . since no explicit solutions of the nonlinear ( sub)diffusion - reaction equations",
    "are known , one commonly considers a simplified system , for example a one in which diffusion coefficients of both reactants are assumed to be equal to each other .",
    "there is assumed that the some characteristic functions are the same in the system with any simplified assumptions @xcite .",
    "the problem is to choose a method to study the subdiffusion - reaction equations .",
    "the scaling method dose not allow one to determine @xmath3 unless special conditions are taken into account .",
    "the perturbation method is of small efficiency because the first order correction is often insufficient , while the higher order corrections are hard to obtain even in the case of normal diffusion .",
    "so , there are a few problems solved using this method @xcite .",
    "an alternative method is the quasistationary one . in the case of normal diffusion - reaction system",
    "it is based on the assumption that process proceeds so slowly that changes of concentration of transported substance are small in some regions @xcite .",
    "since the subdiffusion process is significantly slower than the normal diffusion one , we expect that the quasistationary approximation is also applicable to the subdiffusive case .",
    "thus , we adopt the method in this study . the scaling method and the quasistationary approximation one",
    "are often treated as equivalent to each other .",
    "we note however that the equivalence holds only in the long time limit @xcite . at shorter times applicability of the quasistationary method",
    "does not imply applicability of scaling one and vice versa ( this problem will be discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper we find that the time evolution of the reaction front is given by the formula @xmath16 for a system with arbitrary non  zero values of the subdiffusion coefficients .",
    "the coefficient @xmath3 fulfills the special equation derived in this paper .",
    "our analytical results are confirmed by the numerical solutions of subdiffusion  reaction equations .",
    "a real system is usually three  dimensional , but we assume that it is homogeneous in the plane perpendicular to the @xmath17 axis . therefore , we involve only one space variable @xmath17 into considerations . the subdiffusion ",
    "reaction equations are @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 denotes the concentration of the diffusing particles of species @xmath21 , @xmath22  the subdiffusion coefficient , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , the parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 occur in the reaction term ( eq .  ( [ eq4 ] ) below ) ; the riemann  liouville fractional time derivative is defined for the case of @xmath14 as @xmath27 throughout this paper we assume that both of the reactants are mobile @xmath28 .",
    "let us note that the choice of the reaction term is not obvious @xcite .",
    "the reaction term , which we involve into considerations and which was used to study the subdiffusion ",
    "reaction system in @xcite , is @xmath29 where the term @xmath30 within the mean field approximation reads @xmath31 @xmath32 is the reaction rate and the parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 are determined experimentally .",
    "we assume that the particles of reactants @xmath4 and @xmath5 are initially separated from each other .",
    "thus , the initial conditions are @xmath33 it was observed @xcite that when the process starts , there appear characteristic regions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] ) : the depletion zone @xmath34 , which is defined as a region where the concentrations are significantly smaller than the initial ones ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) , the reaction region where the production of particles @xmath37 is significant ( @xmath38 ) , and the diffusion region @xmath39 , where the reaction term @xmath30 is close to zero and the particle transport appears to be almost subdiffusive ( i.e. without chemical reactions ) .    schematic view of the system under considerations ; @xmath0 is the reaction front , @xmath34 and @xmath39 denote the depletion zone and the diffusion region , respectively . ]    for the normal diffusion the widths of the depletion zone @xmath40 and the reaction region @xmath41 grow as the power functions of time @xcite , @xmath42 , with @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , where @xmath45 .",
    "the value of parameter @xmath46 depends on the system under study . for the system where the reactants @xmath4 and @xmath5 are mobile",
    ", there is @xmath47 and for the system with a mobile reactant @xmath4 and a static reactant @xmath5 we have @xmath48 , where @xmath25 is the parameter occurring in the reaction term @xmath49 in eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . as was reported in @xcite , @xmath50 evolve in time according to the power functions also for the subdiffusive  reaction system with @xmath51 .",
    "an important characteristics of the system under consideration is the time evolution of the reaction front @xmath0 .",
    "it is defined as a point where the reaction term @xmath30 reaches its maximum @xmath52 or , as argued in @xcite , for @xmath53 it is defined by the relation @xmath54 and in more general situation by @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , these definitions are difficult to apply for the numerically obtained concentrations . in the following ,",
    "we use the definition of the reaction front as @xmath56 although the relations defining the reaction front are not always equivalent to each other , all of them provide to @xmath57 lying inside the reaction region , and in the long time limit the definitions lead to the power functions of time .    for the normal diffusion",
    "there is the dependence @xcite @xmath58 with @xmath59 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite by means of the scaling method that the relation ( [ xfg ] ) with @xmath60 holds for the subdiffusive system where the subdiffusion coefficients of reactants are equal to each other .",
    "the quasistatic approximation assumes that the concentration profile is a slowly varying function of time in a given region .",
    "thus , the time derivation is small and consequently , the r.h.s . of ( sub)diffusion equation ( [ eq2 ] ) is also small in the region .",
    "it requires @xmath61    since the reaction term is relatively large in the reaction zone , the quasistatic approximation holds in this zone under the condition @xmath62 we note that the condition ( [ r3 ] ) is fulfilled when the concentration profiles are given in the scaling form @xcite .    in the diffusive region",
    "where @xmath63 , the quasistatic approximation is applicable when the concentration is a linear function of @xmath17 , as the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) then vanishes .",
    "the regions outside the reaction zone , where the concentration linearly varies with @xmath17 , determine the borders of the quasistatic region .",
    "the solution of subdiffusion equation without chemical reactions works here .    in the studies of the normal diffusion with reactions ,",
    "one introduces the quasistatic approximation referring to the equilibration time @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath64 is of order of the average time which is needed for the substance to spread over the interval of length @xmath50 when the substance flows from outside of the interval . for the normal diffusion - reaction system",
    "this parameter was estimated from the relation @xmath65 .",
    "taking @xmath66 and @xmath67 one gets @xmath68 . for",
    "the subdiffusive system the relation @xmath69 provides @xmath70    as for the normal diffusion case , let us assume that the relative change of the flux @xmath71 fulfills the relation @xmath72 which gives @xmath73 the balance between the subdiffusion term and the reaction one is achieved when the equilibration time @xmath64 of the reaction region is negligibly small comparing to the time ( @xmath74 ) of relative change of the flux in the long time limit .",
    "so , the quasistatic approximation is applicable when @xmath75 the quasistatic region is usually defined as a region where at least one of the conditions ( [ r2 ] ) , ( [ r3 ] ) or ( [ r4 ] ) is fulfilled . as far as we know ,",
    "the equivalence of these definitions have not been proven yet . in our considerations",

    "( [ r2 ] ) is assumed .",
    "as in the normal diffusion reaction system , to find the widths of appropriate region we assume that the parameters @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the irrelevant parameters of the system .",
    "this means that the results obtained for @xmath79 and/or @xmath80 are qualitatively equivalent to the one with @xmath81 and/or @xmath82 , except of very few obvious cases ( for example , when @xmath83 the reaction front does not move ) . in this section",
    "we derive the time evolution of the widths of the reaction region @xmath50 and the depletion zone @xmath76 under condition @xmath83 .    at first",
    "we argue that the assumption @xmath45 is correct not only for the diffusive but for the subdiffusive systems as well . in @xcite",

    "let us assume that the initial concentrations and subdiffusion coefficients of both reactants are equal to each other @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",

    ", the flux vanishes at the wall . in this case the green s function can be obtained by replacing the wall by the auxiliary ips of the same strength in the position symmetric to the initial point @xmath151 with respect to the wall @xmath154 where @xmath155 denotes the green s function for homogeneous system . in the case of fully absorbing wall",
