    "in this note we consider the abstract second order system @xmath0 where @xmath1 are selfadjoint operators in a hilbert space @xmath2 with the scalar product @xmath3 linear in the second and antilinear in the first variable . for simplicity , we assume that the operators @xmath4 are positive definite and that @xmath5 are bounded .",

    "the resolvent of @xmath10 is immediately seen to be given by @xmath16\\ ] ] with @xmath17 at least for those @xmath18 for which @xmath19 remains positive definite .",
    "this formula is rigorous , if @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 are all bounded , otherwise the terms @xmath23 and @xmath24 have to be replaced by their closures ; the latter are obviously everywhere defined and bounded .",
    "most existing works on the exponential decay estimate the infimum of all @xmath25 for which @xmath26    the infimum value @xmath27 of all possible @xmath25 in ( [ bound ] ) ( the _ type of the semigroup _ in the terminology of @xcite ) is often equal to the maximal real part of the spectrum of @xmath10 . in",
    "looking for this infimum usually little attention is paid to the constant @xmath28 which may tend to infinity as @xmath25 approaches the infimum ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . since this constant plays a key role in controlling the finite - time behaviour of the system we are interested in a bound in which both @xmath25 and @xmath28 are tried to be made simply computable from the coefficients @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "in fact , we obtain a family of estimates ( [ bound ] ) for any @xmath25 from the interval @xmath29 $ ] , where @xmath30 while @xmath28 is an expression with similar ingredients .",
    "the set @xmath31 is called _ the numerical range _ of the matrix pencil @xmath19 ( cf .",
    "e.g @xcite ) .",
    "our result implies , in fact , @xmath32 the bound for @xmath33 , obtained in @xcite reads in our notations @xmath34 the values @xmath35 and @xmath36 are not easy to compare in general . for any underdamped system i.e.",
    "whenever the expression under the square root in ( [ gamma00 ] ) is uniformly negative , we obviously have @xmath37 . for further comparisons",

    "i , ch .  6 . for the wave equation with distributed viscous damping .",
    "the bound obtained there is much less explicit than ours ; this actually made impossible any comparison of the two .",
    "as a by - product , we prove that @xmath33 is equal to the supremum of the real part of the spectrum of @xmath10 for `` partly overdamped systems '' i.e. for those for which @xmath38 is positive definite .",
    "another case in which this equality is shown to hold are the so - called modally damped systems .",
    "our main tool will be the spectral shift substitution @xmath39 which gives rise to a new phase space representation , equivalent to the previous one .",
    "this yields a fairly simple total - energy decay estimate .",
    "applications are made to both finite matrices and differential operators of mathematical physics .",
    "the obtained estimate is shown to be ( asymptotically ) attainable and therefore in some weak sense optimal .",
    "on the other hand , our estimate is void , if damping has a nontrivial nulspace . while there are such systems with no exponential decay at all , there are still many relevant cases whose decay is not covered by our theory . in sec .",
    "2 we provide illustrating examples .    the substitution @xmath40 yields @xmath41 @xmath42 and ( [ system_mck ] ) reads @xmath43 with @xmath44 as long as @xmath45 stay positive definite this is equivalent to the phase space representation @xmath46,\\ ] ] @xmath47,\\quad\\ ] ] with the solution @xmath48 we now connect these two representations .",

    "our general operator setting requires additional justifications of these steps .",
    "also , we need a more explicit bound on the condition number which appears on the right hand side of ( [ decay0 ] ) .",

    "since @xmath35 is negative then for @xmath83 both @xmath61 and @xmath84 remain positive definite .",
    "the boundedness of @xmath5 implies ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath85 so both ( [ lmu ] ) and its inverse @xmath86\\ ] ] are everywhere defined and bounded ( a straightforward calculation shows that the one is the inverse of the other ) .",

    "* under our assumption , as in the proof of proposition [ infbound ] , it follows that @xmath75 is not boundedly invertible while @xmath19 is positive definite for any @xmath100 .",
    "now , the @xmath101-block in the resolvent matrix in ( [ resolvent ] ) gets unbounded for @xmath102 .",
