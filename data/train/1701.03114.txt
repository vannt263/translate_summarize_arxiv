    "the goal of information theory is to find the fundamental limits imposed on information processing and transmission by the laws of physics .",
    "one of the early breakthroughs in quantum information theory was the characterisation of the capacity of a classical - quantum ( c - q ) channel to transmit classical information by holevo  @xcite and schumacher - westmoreland  @xcite .",
    "the _ classical capacity _ of a quantum channel is defined is the maximal rate ( in bits per channel use ) at which we can transmit information such that the decoding error vanishes asymptotically as the length of the code increases .",
    "however , for many practical applications there are natural restrictions on the code length imposed , for example , by limitations on how much quantum information can be processed coherently .",
    "therefore it is crucial to go beyond the asymptotic treatment and understand the intricate tradeoff between decoding error probability , code rate and code length .    for this purpose , we will study families of codes that _ both _ have a rate approaching the capacity and an error probability that vanishes asymptotically as the code length @xmath0 increases .",
    "the following tradeoff relation gives a rough illustration of our main result : if the code rate approaches capacity as @xmath1 for some @xmath2 , then the decoding error can not be smaller than @xmath3 .",

    "our work thus complements previous work on the boundary cases corresponding to @xmath5 . the error exponent ( or reliability function ) of c - q channels ( see , e.g. , refs .",
