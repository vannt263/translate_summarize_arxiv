    "emission lines at @xmath7 kev are the strongest discrete features in the x - ray band , and indeed appear to be ubiquitous in all kind of accreting compact objects .",
    "these have been observed in active galactic nuclei ( agn , see e.g.  tanaka et al .",
    "1995 ; fabian et al .",
    "2002 , and references therein ) , in x - ray binaries containing stellar mass black holes ( see e.g.  miller et al .  2002 ; miller et al .",
    "2004 ) as well as in x - ray binaries containing a low magnetised neutron star ( lmxbs , see e.g.  bhattacharyya & strohmayer 2007 ; cackett et al .  2008 ; pandel et al .",
    "2008 ; da  et al .",
    "these lines are therefore a powerful tool to exploit the physical properties of the emitting region that in most cases is quite close to the compact object .",
    "the line profile often appears very smeared and asymmetric , with red wings extending down to 3 kev or even less . in",
    "most ( if not all ) cases this profile has been ascribed to the doppler and relativistic effects caused by the high keplerian velocities in the accretion disc which extends deeply in the gravitational potential well of the compact object .    in fact ( see matt 2006 for a review , and references therein ) , if an emission line is produced in an accretion disc , which is illuminated by the main comptonised continuum coming from a corona , the high velocities in the disc produce a double peaked line profile : the blue - shifted peak arising from matter approaching the observer and the red - shifted peak from matter receding .",
    "the separation in frequency between these two peaks depends on the line - of - sight velocity difference , which in turn depends on the inclination of the disc and on the radius where the emission occurs . at small radii",
    "the keplerian velocities become relativistic , and this causes that the intensity of the blue peak apparently exceeds that of the red peak because of doppler boosting .",
    "finally , for very small radii , the gravitational redshift becomes important and the entire profile may be shifted to lower energies ( see fabian et al .",
    "1989 and laor 1991 for detailed modelling of these profiles ) .",
    "although compelling evidence can been found in literature that iron line profiles often appear broad and asymmetric , and important diagnostics of the emitting region have been inferred ( see e.g.  reynolds , brenneman , & garofalo 2005 as a review ) , alternative explanations for the line broadening have been suggested .",
    "in fact , it is also possible to obtain broad and asymmetric profiles by comptonisation of line photons in a medium of moderate optical depth and temperature of a few kev ( e.g.  kallman & white 1989 ; brandt & matt 1994 ; misra & kembhavi 1998 ; rozanska & madej 2008 ; see , however , reynolds & wilms 2000 for a discussion of the case of mcg63015 ) or with other kind of non - thermal comptonisation ( laurent & titarchuk 2007 ) ; complex absorption may also mimic a very broad relativistic profile ( miller et al .",
    "even if the relativistic disc line is often the most convincing solution , it is clear that more direct and unambiguous evidences would be highly desirable .",
    "in this paper we present a high statistics and well resolved disc line profile in a lmxb containing a neutron star , together with other identified broad emission features and an iron absorption edge compatible with coming from the same disc region .",
    "we are therefore able to find the disc parameters with unprecedented precision .",
    "705 is a lmxb containing a neutron star .",
    "it shows type i bursts and the typical aperiodic variability usually observed for lmxbs of the atoll class ( olive , barret , & gierlinski 2003 ) .",
    "similarly to x - ray binaries containing black holes , this source shows regularly state transitions : from a high / soft state , where the x - ray spectrum is dominated by soft spectral components with typical temperatures less than a few kev , to low / hard states where the x - ray spectrum is dominated by a hard thermal comptonisation ( e.g.  barret & olive 2002 ; piraino et al .",
    "a chandra high energy transmission grating ( hetg ) observation of this source performed in 2001 ( when the source was in a soft state ) revealed the presence of a broad iron line at @xmath8 kev which was well fitted by a _",
    "diskline _ profile ( di salvo et al .",
    "however , the _ diskline _ profile gave an equally good fit as using a simple gaussian profile , the double peaked profile was not resolved in the chandra / hetg spectrum , and hence we could not exclude other possible origins for the broad iron line profile .",
    "the relativistic nature of the iron line profile in 705 has been very recently confirmed by a suzaku observation ; the inferred inner radius of the disc was @xmath9 , while the inclination of the system with respect to the line of sight resulted to be @xmath10 ( reis , fabian , & young 2009 ) .    in order to unambiguously resolve the line profile",
    ", we obtained a dedicated _ xmm - newton _ observation of this source that was performed in august 2006 .",
    "however , _",
    "xmm - newton _ caught the source during a hard state , and the line was observed to be much weaker than during the chandra observation ( these results will be presented in a forthcoming paper ) .",
    "we therefore asked for a target of opportunity observation with _ xmm - newton _ in order to observe the source during a soft state .",
    "the too trigger was a source count rate higher than 10 c / s observed by the all sky monitor ( asm ) on board rxte .",
    "this last observation was performed on august 24th 2008 ( when the asm count rate was about 20 c / s ) for a total exposure time of about 45  ks . in this paper",
    "we present the spectral analysis of the data from this last _ xmm - newton _ observation .",
    "the epic  pn camera was operated in timing mode , to prevent photon pile - up and to allow an analysis of the coherent and aperiodic timing behaviour of the source .",
    "mos cameras were switched off during the observation in order to allocate as much telemetry as possible to the pn , and the reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs ) was operated in the standard spectroscopy mode . since we are interested here in a study of the iron line profile at @xmath11  kev , we focus our study only on epic  pn data",
    ". data were extracted and reduced using sas v.8.0.0 .",
    "we produced a calibrated epic ",
    "pn event list through the _ epproc _ pipeline .",
    "we extracted the source spectrum selecting a 13 pixels wide stripe around the source position equivalent to @xmath12 ( which should encircle more than @xmath13 of the energy up to 9 kev ) , and considered only pattern@xmath144 and flag=0 events as a standard procedure to eliminate spurious events .",
    "the background spectrum was extracted from a region of the pn field of view as far as possible from the source position .    for spectral analysis",
    "the epic  pn energy channels were grouped by a factor of four in order to avoid an oversampling of the energy resolution bin of the instrument .",
    "the x - ray spectral package we use to model the observed emission is heasarc _ xspec _ v.12.3.0 .",
    "the average count rate during our observation of 705 was 767 c / s in the whole pn energy range .",
    "this is below the maximum count rate to avoid deteriorated response due to photon pile - up for pn observations in timing mode , that is 800 c / s as reported in the _ xmm - newton _ user handbook .",
    "however , in order to check that pile - up does not significantly affect the pn spectrum , we have also extracted the pn spectrum excluding the contributions from the central brightest pixels in order to minimise the pile - up effect .",
    "results from the two spectral sets are perfectly consistent with each other , and we therefore decided to proceed using the spectrum with the highest signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "we started to fit the continuum in the pn 2.411 kev energy range with the typical model used for neutron star lmxbs of the atoll class , which revealed to be the best fit continuum for this source too ( see e.g.  di salvo et al .  2005 ;",
    "piraino et al .  2007 ; barret & olive 2002 ) , that is a blackbody and a thermal comptonised component modelled by _ comptt _ ( titarchuk 1994 ) , modified at low energy by photoelectric absorption modelled by _ phabs _ in xspec .",
    "this continuum model gave , however , an unacceptable fit , corresponding to a @xmath15 for the presence of evident localised residuals in the whole pn range .",
    "the most prominent is a clear iron line profile at energies from 5.5 to 7.5 kev at more than @xmath16 from the best fit continuum ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    ".the best fit parameters of the continuum emission of the _ xmm - newton_/pn spectrum of 705 .",
    "the blackbody luminosity is given in units of @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the bolometric luminosity in units of @xmath19  ergs / s and @xmath20 the distance to the source in units of 10  kpc .",
    "the blackbody radius is calculated in the hypothesis of spherical emission and for a distance of 7.4  kpc .",
    "flux is calculated in the @xmath21 kev band .",
    "uncertainties are given at @xmath13 confidence level . [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in order to fit these residuals we added to our continuum model gaussian emission lines at @xmath22 kev ( s  xvi ) , @xmath23 kev ( ar  xviii ) , @xmath24 kev ( ca xix ) , and @xmath25 kev ( fe  xxv ) , respectively .",
    "this gave a great improvement of the fit , corresponding to a @xmath26 .",
    "all these lines appear to be significantly broader than the pn energy resolution , with their gaussian @xmath27 going from 120 ev for s xvi to 160 ev for ar xviii , to 170 ev for ca xix , and to 260 ev for fe xxv , respectively .",
    "note that a relatively broad ( @xmath28 ev ) emission feature at @xmath22  kev and compatible with the ly@xmath1 transition of s  xvi was already significantly detected in the chandra / hetg spectrum of this source ( di salvo et al .",
    "the fit is further improved if we add an absorption edge at 8.47 kev , most probably caused by photoelectric absorption of fe xxv ( this fit gives @xmath29 ) .",
    "since the iron line profile visible in the residuals shown in figure  1 clearly suggests a double peaked shape , typical of a relativistically smeared line produced by reflection of the primary comptonisation spectrum from an accretion disc , we substitute the gaussian at 6.7 kev with a diskline profile , obtaining again a significant improvement of the fit ( @xmath30 , corresponding to a @xmath31 for the addition of three parameters ) .",
    "all the diskline parameters appear very well determined by the fit , and their best - fit values do not depend from the particular choice of the continuum model .",
    "the widths of the other gaussian lines are also quite large , @xmath32 ev , suggesting that these lines may also be affected by doppler and relativistic distortions . to prove this hypothesis",
    ", we hence substitute these gaussian lines with disklines , with all the parameters fixed at those of the iron diskline , and we just fitted the line centroid energy and the normalisation of these components . in this way we obtain an equally good fit , with a @xmath33 ( note that the @xmath34 is higher but we have now 3 free parameters less with respect to the fit with gaussian lines ) .",
    "we note that , although the uncertainties obtained from the fit are very small ( less than 1% on the line energies ) , the rest - frame energies we obtain for all these low - energy lines are perfectly compatible with the rest - frame energies of the strongest expected transitions in the pn ( 2.410 kev ) range ( see table  2 ) . moreover , from the line rest - frame energies",
    "we can infer that lighter elements ( s and ar ) are in a h - like configuration , while heavier elements ( ca and fe ) are in a he - like configuration .",
    "this suggests a ionisation parameter of @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is defined as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the ionising x - ray luminosity , @xmath39 the density in the reflector , and @xmath40 the distance with respect to the emitting central sources .     in the @xmath41 kev pn range with respect to the continuum model , composed by the photoelectric absorption phabs , a blackbody and the comptonisation model comptt , fitted in the whole pn range but excluding the @xmath42 kev range .",

    "3 we show the unfolded spectrum of the source .    finally , to check the statistical significance of the diskline profile for the iron emission line , we have substituted the diskline with a gaussian in order to compare the corresponding @xmath34s . in this case , the @xmath47 increases from @xmath48 using a diskline profile to @xmath49 using a gaussian profile for the iron line .",
    "the diskline gives a better fit , with a @xmath50 for the addition of 3 parameters ( an f - test would give a probability of chance improvement of the fit of @xmath51 ) .",

    "in fact , using two gaussian profiles to describe the iron emission line , we find a @xmath52 which is worse than what we obtain using just one diskline profile .",
    "moreover , the gaussian centroid energies are not easily explained in terms of blending of different iron lines , since the strongest gaussian peaks at @xmath53  kev , while the other gaussian ( much weaker than the first one ) is centred at @xmath54  kev and tries to fit the red peak of the line profile . fixing this line energy to @xmath55  kev ( or using two diskline profiles at 6.4 kev and 6.7 kev , respectively , instead of gaussians )",

    "the iron k@xmath1 line at @xmath11 kev is one of the most important diagnostic tools in x - ray spectra of accreting black holes . in particular ,",
    "if the line is produced in the innermost part of the accretion disc , the line profile is distorted by doppler effects caused by the fast keplerian motion and relativistic effects caused by the distorted space - time very close to the compact object .",
    "these effects produce characteristic smeared and asymmetric profiles , from which we can derive essential information on the physical parameters of the accretion disc close to the compact object .",
    "the same physics should apply to x - ray binaries containing a low - magnetised neutron star , since the geometry of the accretion flow close to the central compact object is very similar .",
    "indeed , compelling evidences have been found that iron line profiles in neutron star lmxbs are smeared by relativistic effects in the inner accretion disc .",
    "the first clear example was the _ xmm - newton _ spectrum of atoll source ser x1 ( bhattacharyya & strohmayer 2007 ) , where the fit of the line profile with a laor model was statistically preferred with respect to a simple gaussian model .",
    "the relativistic nature of the iron line profile in ser x1 was also confirmed by a suzaku observation ( cackett et al .",
    "cackett et al .",
    "( 2008 ) also detect relativistic iron line profiles in suzaku observations of the z - source gx 349 + 2 ( see also iaria et al .",
    "2009 ) and the atoll source 4u  182030 .",
    "a relativistic line profile is also observed in an _ xmm - newton _ observation of the z - source gx  340 + 0 ( da  et al .",
    "2009 ) and in the atoll source and accreting millisecond pulsar sax  j1808.43658 ( papitto et al .  2009 ; cackett et al .",
    "a broad iron line profile is also observed in the _ xmm - newton _ observation of the bright atoll 4u  1636536 ( pandel et al .",
    "2008 ) ; in this case the authors suggest that the broad line should be interpreted as a blending of several lines from iron in different ionisation states .",
    "finally , the presence of a relativistic iron line profile in chandra data of the atoll source 705 was suggested by di salvo et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and recently confirmed by suzaku observations of this source ( reis et al .",
    "2009 ) .    in this paper we have presented a high quality spectrum of the lmxb and atoll source 705 acquired by _ xmm - newton _ during a soft state",
    "we have shown that this spectrum is well described by a coherent disc - reflection scenario , confirming with the highest statistics so far that the broadening mechanism is due to doppler and relativistic effects at the inner edge of an accretion disc .",
    "the high statistics of the _ xmm - newton_/pn spectrum allows us to determine the best fit parameters with unprecedented precision .",
    "the parameters of the continuum are in good agreement with previous results ( e.g. piraino et al .  2007 ) .",
    "the presence of several emission lines and an absorption edge from highly ionised elements ( the most abundant emitters in the pn range ) testifies the presence of a highly ionised matter in the reflector .",
    "we have estimated a not - extreme value of the ionisation parameter , @xmath35 , compatible with the presence of h - like s and ar and he - like ca and fe .",
    "the iron line profile clearly shows the signature of a disc origin .",
    "the rest - frame energy , @xmath56 kev , is compatible with the k@xmath1 transition of he - like iron ( fe  xxv , resonance or intercombination line ) , testifying that the reflecting matter is highly ionised .",
    "the line appears to be produced from @xmath57 ( where @xmath58 is the gravitational radius and it is 1.5 km for a @xmath59 neutron star ) to @xmath60 .",
    "the inner radius of the disc therefore results to be @xmath61  km , where @xmath62 is the neutron star mass in units of @xmath63 .",
    "note that , for reasonable values of the neutron star mass , this measure clearly indicate that the disc is truncated significantly far from the neutron star surface .",
    "interestingly the radius of the soft blackbody emission , that we identify ( in agreement with piraino et al .  2007 ) with optically thick emission from the accretion disc , gives a radius of @xmath64  km , calculated under the simple hypothesis of spherical emission and for a distance to the source of 7.4 kpc ( haberl & titarchuk 1995 ) .",
    "despite the uncertainties in the emission geometry and distance to the source , the coincidence between the inner radius of the disc as calculated from the diskline and from the blackbody emission , is at least compelling .",
    "this is the first time to our knowledge that such a large consistency is found among all the spectral components in a neutron star lmxb .",
    "the power law dependence of the disc emissivity , @xmath65 , is parametrised by the index @xmath66 which is @xmath67 , indicating that the disc emission is dominated by irradiation by a central source ( see fabian et al.1989 ) . finally , the disc inclination with respect to the line of sight is also well determined , @xmath68 degrees .",
    "signatures of a disc reflection origin are present not only in the iron line profile , but also in the entire spectrum , and in particular in the discrete features present at soft x - rays .",
    "these are produced by the most abundant elements in the pn band , again highly ionised ( h or he - like elements ) .",
    "in particular we find emission features from s xvi , ar xviii , and ca xix , respectively , and all of them appear quite broad , with a fwhm which steadily increases with line energy , as expected in the hypothesis of doppler broadening .",
    "fitting these lines with disklines , where we fix the emissivity index , the inner and outer disc radii , and the inclination angle to the corresponding values of the iron diskline profile , we obtain an equally good fit , indicating that these lines are compatible with being produced in the same region where the iron line is produced .",
    "as expected , the iron absorption edge from fe  xxv is also detected in the spectrum .",
    "however , it also appears to be smeared ( with a width of about 0.7 kev ) and at an energy of @xmath69 kev , which appears to be significantly redshifted with respect to the rest - frame energy of 8.828  kev ( according to the hullac code value ) by @xmath70 .",
    "a smeared and redshifted edge is also in agreement with the hypothesis that this feature is produced in the inner accretion disc .",
    "for instance , in the hypothesis that this redshift is explained by gravitational redshift , the relation between the observed energy and the rest - frame energy may be written as @xmath71 , where @xmath72^{1/2}$ ] , from which we can derive the ( averaged ) radius of the emitting region , @xmath73 , that is very close in radius to the region where the iron _ diskline _ is produced . in conclusion ,",
    "the extraordinary high quality _ xmm - newton _ spectrum of 705 can be considered as a testbed for testing and developing high resolution reflection models .",
    "attempts to fit this spectrum with available reflection models ( see e.g.  ross & fabian 2005 which consider reflection models from highly ionised media ) are in progress ; the results are already good and will be published in a forthcoming paper . however",
    ", none of the reflection models available to date include all the features we observe in this spectrum ; in particular emission lines from ar and ca are still missing . developing self - consistent and complete reflection models appears to be a very important task in view of the future , high resolution , x - ray missions , since with these spectra we are really looking at the innermost accretion disc .",
