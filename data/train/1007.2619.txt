    "understanding the confinement of gluons is a challenging problem , because characteristic and significant quantities providing both analytical and numerical access are difficult to identify straightforwardly . in recent years , the study of the confinement mechanism based on the ir behavior of gauge - dependent correlation functions has turned out to be both fruitful and inspiring .",
    "most prominently , this has lead to two different confinement scenarios : the gribov - zwanziger @xcite scenario on one hand and the kugo - ojima scenario on the other hand @xcite .",
    "this scenarios are mutually related and connect signatures of color confinement with the low - momentum behavior of gluon and ghost correlation functions .",
    "they have been intensely investigated by a variety of nonperturbative field theoretical tools such as lattice gauge theory @xcite as well as functional methods @xcite .",
    "even if color confinement is eventually properly accounted for by a corresponding ir behavior of correlation functions , indicating , e.g , positivity violation and the absence of colored states in the physical state space , the remaining pressing open question is the relation of color confinement to quark confinement .",
    "typical quark - confinement criteria such as those based on the wilson - loop or polyakov - loop expectation value @xcite in quenched qcd have long remained inaccessible from the pure knowledge of low - order correlation functions of the gauge sector .",
    "for instance , a direct computation of the heavy - quark potential requires additional knowledge , e.g. , of the quark - gluon vertex  @xcite or of the static gluon correlator in the coulomb gauge  @xcite .    in  @xcite",
    "a more direct relation between color confinement and quark confinement has been established . there , a thermodynamic order parameter , namely the polyakov loop , has been computed from the yang - mills propagators , thereby establishing for the first time a direct link between the ir behavior of correlation functions and quark confinement . aside from the above relation of color confinement and quark confinement , the relation between quark confinement and chiral symmetry breaking has more recently been studied with the aid of so - called dual observables  @xcite .",
    "these formal and computational advances better our understanding of the mechanisms underlying confinement and chiral symmetry breaking and pave the way towards a first principle access to qcd with functional methods .",
    "in particular , the approach put forward in  @xcite gives us access not only to an order parameter for confinement , the polyakov loop , but also to its full effective potential .",
    "the latter is a crucial input in polyakov loop extended effective models such as the pnjl and the pqm models  @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the polyakov loop potential is an external input the parameter of which are fixed to reproduce pure yang - mills lattice results .",
    "evidently , these physics constraints do not completely fix the potential , leave aside its extension to full qcd .",
    "different potentials have been studied , for a comparison see e.g. @xcite , and the physics at finite chemical potential is in fact very sensitive to parameter changes . in this regard",
    "the present approach provides the opportunity for a qualitative improvement of the above models since it allows to fix the yang - mills potentials completely from first principles , see also @xcite .",
    "this has motivated further studies such as the delevopment of a framework for the study of qcd with two colors @xcite .",
    "moreover the present approach underlies the fully dynamical continuum study of two - flavor qcd at finite temperature and quark chemical potential put forward in @xcite .",
    "the present work is devoted to a more detailed analysis of the interrelation between color confinement and quark confinement as deduced in @xcite .",
    "in addition to providing a more comprehensive technical insight into the underlying ideas , we illustrate this interrelation and the generality of the approach by applying it to a variety of non - abelian gauge theories near the deconfinement phase transition .",
    "in fact , while the phase transition is of second order in @xmath5 yang - mills theory , it is well - known from lattice simulations that a first - order phase transition occurs in @xmath1 gauge theories with @xmath6 .",
    "this brings up the question on how the nature of the phase transition is related to the properties of the underlying gauge group .",
    "it has been conjectured in @xcite based on the order - disorder nature of the deconfinement phase transition with respect to center symmetry that the phase transition of @xmath5 yang - mills theory should fall into the ising universality class .",
    "this observation based on the symmetry properties of the center of the gauge group does not necessarily extend to the other gauge groups with a center symmetry agreeing with a 2nd order universality class . in",
    "@xcite it has been conjectured that the dynamics near the critical temperature is sensitive to the mismatch of the number of dynamical degrees of freedom in the confined and deconfined phase . in accordance with this conjecture",
    "a first - order phase transition has been found for @xmath3 even though the center of the group is @xmath7  @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we study @xmath3 and @xmath4 gauge theory ( the center of both groups is @xmath7 ) and compare the results to our findings for @xmath1 gauge theories also in order to shed more light on the conjecture put forward in  @xcite .    our study of the deconfinement phase transition is based on an order parameter related to the polyakov loop variable , @xmath8 = \\frac{1}{{n_{\\text{c } } } } { \\mathrm{tr}}\\ , \\cp\\ , \\exp \\left ( { \\mathrm{i}}g    \\int\\limits_0^\\beta dx_0\\ , \\mathsf{a}_0(x_0,x ) \\right ) , \\label{1}\\ ] ] more precisely on the expectation value of @xmath9 in polyakov gauge , see also @xcite .",
    "then , @xmath10 is sensitive to topological defects related to confinement @xcite , and also serves as a deconfinement order parameter .",
    "the effective potential of @xmath9 is accessible from the knowledge of gauge correlation functions by means of the functional renormalization group ( rg ) , @xcite . as an additional characteristic ingredient for a quantitative understanding of the phase transition",
    "we introduce and identify eigenvalue distributions of the order parameter which exhibit characteristic traces and facilitate a quantitative understanding of the behavior of the corresponding effective potential .",

    "the infrared ( ir ) regulator scale @xmath14 separates the fluctuations with momenta @xmath15 which are already included in @xmath11 , from those with smaller momenta which still have to be integrated out . the full rg trajectory is given by the solution to the wetterich equation ( @xmath16 ) , @xmath17=\\frac{1}{2 } { \\mathrm{str}}\\0{1}{{\\gamma_k^{(2)}}[\\phi]+r_k } { \\partial_t}r_k\\ , , \\label{floweq}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 denotes the second functional derivative with respect to the dynamical field @xmath19 , collectively summarizing gluon and ghost fields in the present context .",

    ", as @xmath29 does not vanish for large momenta .",
    "whereas the representation thus is of limited practical use in the general case , it is ideally suited for the determination of an order - parameter potential which is uv finite from the beginning , as is the weiss potential .",
    "in fact , our quantitative results for the order - parameter potential are dominated already by the first term of eq .  .",
    "for the remainder of this section , we will , however , be concerned with an optimized strategy to evaluate the contributions from the @xmath30 term .",
    "the evaluation of this ` rg - improvement term ' @xmath31 requires two nontrivial ingredients : full gluon and ghost propagators in the presence of an ir regulator , @xmath32 and the flow of the inverse propagator @xmath29 .",
    "this information has been made available in @xcite where the full momentum dependence of landau - gauge propagators has been computed within optimized rg flows . for earlier rg calculations , acquiring partial knowledge about yang - mills propagators and providing evidence for the kugo - ojima / gribov - zwanziger confinement scenarios ,",

    "optimization of the rg flow has not only the advantage of a more stable and faster convergent numerical scheme ; in a given truncation , it can actually be posed as a stability / convergence problem @xcite .",
    "it also provides for a link to using propagators obtained from lattice simulations , see below .",
    "full functional optimization can be reformulated as the quest for a minimal flow trajectory for general functional flows @xcite .",
    "in other words , for a given gap @xmath33 of the propagator which constitutes the inverse of the physical infrared cut - off , the integrated optimized flow is already as close as possible to the full theory , as the remaining flow trajectory is minimal .",

    "let us elucidate aspects of the optimized flow in the context of the integrated flow .",

    "the second term on the right - hand side of the first line constitutes an rg improvement term .",
    "in order to arrive at the effective potential for an order - parameter field , we parameterize the fluctuations with respect to a background field which is related to the order parameter . in yang - mills theories , this decomposition into fluctuating modes and the background field can be organized such that the resulting background - field action preserves a residual gauge symmetry , e.  g. @xcite .",
    "this approach using the background - field gauge can be understood as a simple extension of yang - mills theories within general covariant gauges .",
    "the gauge condition @xmath51 is generalized to @xmath52 for an unspecified background field @xmath53 .",

    "a less strict gauian average over the gauge condition @xmath54 with a probability distribution @xmath55 leads to the background - field equivalent of a general covariant gauge .",
    "such a formulation has the benefit of an auxiliary gauge symmetry for the effective action under a transformation of both , the full gauge field @xmath56 and the background @xmath57 . in this manner ,",

    "we emphasize that the background - field gauge transformation is an auxiliary symmetry .",

    "these follow from a gauge or brst transformation of the field @xmath19 at fixed background . indeed ,",

    "for instance , this approach predicts the existence of an infrared fixed point of the coupling at zero and finite temperature @xcite , as it is similarly found in landau gauge qcd .",
    "however , within the present context of the order - parameter potential , it is crucial to go beyond the approximation used in @xcite , as the confinement - deconfinement phase transition is rather sensitive to the correct mid - momentum and infrared behavior of the fluctuation - field propagator @xmath72 $ ] .",
    "therefore , a proper distinction between the fluctuation - field and background - field dependence of the action is mandatory .",
    "the crucial ingredient for our studies of the confinement phase transition is the two - point function @xmath72 $ ] .",
    "as it is not the output of the pure background - field flow , we have to compute it separately .",
    "from now on , we restrict ourselves to the landau - dewitt gauge   with the gauge parameter set to @xmath75 .",
    "this gauge has several benefits : first , it projects on ( covariantly ) transversal degrees of freedom , and second , the longitudinal components of green functions decouple from the dynamics of the transversal ones , and thirdly it is a fixed point of the flow @xcite .",
    "as the longitudinal components are subject to modified slavnov - taylor identities , this minimizes the truncation error .",
    "this is also related to a second issue , namely the gauge dependence of the background - field effective action @xmath70 $ ] . for landau - dewitt gauge",
    ", this action is identical to the geometrical effective action , see e.g. @xcite , which is gauge invariant also with respect to quantum gauge transformations .",
    "there , the fluctuation field agrees with @xmath58 only in leading order .",
    "the background - field approach in landau - dewitt gauge can indeed be understood as the leading order of a manifestly gauge - invariant approach to functional rg flows @xcite .",

    "the @xmath81 terms can not be obtained from the landau gauge propagator .",
    "they are indeed related to higher landau - gauge green functions .",

    "this family of solutions can be parameterized by an infrared boundary condition for the ghost propagator , specifying a value for @xmath88 .",
    "this fact is reflected in recent lattice solutions on relatively small lattices , @xcite , and in the strong - coupling limit  @xcite , for an alternative point of view see @xcite .    for @xmath89",
    ", there is a unique _ scaling _ solution , @xcite .",
    "the two exponents @xmath90 and @xmath91 are then related by the sum rule arising from a non - renormalization theorem for the ghost - gluon vertex @xcite , @xmath92 in @xmath93 dimensional spacetime @xcite .",
    "admissible solutions are bound to lie in the range @xmath94 $ ] . in pure non - abelian gauge theories , @xmath91 has been computed by a variety of methods  @xcite .",
    "the precise value depends on the ir behavior of the ghost - gluon vertex  @xcite . in most dse and frg computations",
    "we are led to ( @xmath95 ) @xmath96 being the value for the optimized regulator @xcite .",
    "the regulator dependence in frg computations leads to a @xmath91 range of @xmath97 $ ] , see @xcite ; for a specific flow , see @xcite .",
    "these results entail the kugo - ojima / gribov - zwanziger confinement scenario .",
    "the gluon is infrared screened , the propagator even tends to zero , see , , whereas the ghost is infrared enhanced . due to the non - renormalization property of the ghost - gluon vertex , @xcite",
    ", a running coupling can be defined in terms of @xmath98 which runs towards an ir fixed point , see eq .  .",
    "in fig .  [",
    "fig : propagators ] , we show the momentum dependence of the ghost- and gluon propagator as obtained from a functional rg study  @xcite in comparison to lattice results @xcite .",
    "a different type of _ decoupling _ solution is found for non - vanishing @xmath99 : here , the gluon propagator tends to a constant in the infrared , @xmath100 , for related work see e.g.@xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that the gluon propagator then does not correspond to the propagator of a massive physical particle , but clear indications for positivity violation related to gluon confinement are observed , @xcite .",
    "still , the gluon decouples from the dynamics as does a massive particle .",
    "the qualitative infrared behavior is then characterized by the exponents @xmath101 though the infrared exponents for the scaling eq : scaling and decoupling solutions eq : decoupling deviate from another , the propagators do only differ in the deep infrared .",
    "it has been suggested in @xcite that the infrared boundary condition is directly related to the global part of the gauge fixing , hence reflecting different resolutions of the gribov problem .",
    "indeed , the infrared boundary condition has been used as a global completion of the gauge fixing in @xcite .    for most parts of the present work ,",
    "the difference between the scaling and the decoupling solution is of minor importance . for concrete numerical computations , we combine information about the propagators as obtained from the lattice as well as functional methods , completing these propagators in the deep ir with the scaling solution .",
    "the latter is actually singled out by the requirement of global brst for landau gauge yang - mills with standard local brst invariance .",
    "the discussion so far applies to yang - mills theory at zero temperature .",
    "several modifications arise in the presence of a thermal bath , such as the immediate replacement of continuous loop energies @xmath102 by matsubara frequencies @xmath103 in the imaginary - time formalism .",
    "moreover , the gluon propagator acquires an additional component , as the contributions longitudinal and transversal to the heat bath become independent .    in this work",
    ", we neglect the finite - temperature modifications of the propagators , but work with zero - temperature propagators evaluated at the matsubara frequencies . in scalar theories",
    "it has been shown that this approximation already provides a quantitative insight into the finite - temperature phase structure  @xcite .",
    "first results for finite - temperature gluon- and ghost - propagators indeed indicate that the propagators are little modified  @xcite for matsubara frequencies @xmath104 with @xmath105 .",
    "significant changes have been found for the gluon propagator longitudinal to the heat bath which is increased compared to the transversal counterpart .",
    "we stress that the inclusion of the full temperature dependence of the propagators as well as the order - parameter fluctuations is inevitable for an accurate determination of , e.g. , the critical exponents or the thermodynamic properties of the theory ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of finite temperature also takes influence on the form of the propagator at finite background field , as another field invariant , the polyakov loop @xmath106 , exists .",
    "this adds further terms to the right - hand side of eq .  .",
    "specializing to constant background fields @xmath107 , we find schematically @xmath108)^{ab}_{\\mu\\nu}=(\\gamma_{k}^{(2,0)}[0,0 ] ( -d^2 ) ) ^{ab}_{\\mu\\nu}+\\ , l\\,\\,\\text{terms } \\,,\\ ] ] since the @xmath81 term in eq : genprop vanishes , @xmath109 , for @xmath110const . in this work",
    "we drop the @xmath106 contribution in eq : genpropa0 which is related to the second derivative of the order - parameter potential via nielsen identities  @xcite .",
    "we expect that this term affects our results only on a quantitative level , e.  g. , the quality of critical exponents .",
    "for example in @xmath5 gauge theory , we expect a second - order phase transition . here , the critical dynamics encoded in the critical exponents is sensitive to order - parameter fluctuations as is well known from studies of scalar @xmath111 theories .",
    "the @xmath106 terms take a direct influence on the spectrum of order - parameter fluctuations , so that we expect these terms to be relevant at criticality . indeed ,",
    "the role of order - parameter fluctuations has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath5 where the correct @xmath112 critical exponents have been found . however , the phase transition in @xmath1 gauge theories ( @xmath6 ) is of first order and therefore less affected by our approximation of dropping the @xmath106 terms .",
    "let us finally stress that our approximations at finite temperature do not take any influence on our conclusions about confinement in the zero - temperature limit , discussed below .",
    "in particular , the background covariantization of the transverse propagator in eq .   becomes exact in this limit , representing a first important result of our present work .",
    "this paves the way for a fully consistent low - energy rg analysis of qcd in the background - field formalism , see refs .",
    "@xcite for a study of 1-flavor qcd .    from eq .   and the above results for the landau gauge propagators we already conclude that the truncation eq : nectrunc is not working well in the ( deep ) infrared ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "there we expect a fixed point for the coupling , eq : alphas , which entails a constant dressing for the propagator of the background field , @xmath114 : background gauge invariance leads to rg invariance of @xmath115 , and hence to @xmath116 which results in a constant dressing .",
    "therefore the background field propagator @xmath117 diverges in the infrared whereas the propagator of the dynamical fluctuation field @xmath118 , @xmath119 is suppressed in the infrared for both scaling and decoupling solution .",
    "moreover , the ghost propagator is infrared enhanced for the scaling solution in contradistinction to the one - loop truncation used so far in most background field flows , that is @xmath120 which would only be compatible with the decoupling solution .",
    "we conclude that important aspects of the infrared physics can easily be missed by truncations based on eq : nectrunc .",
    "our study of the deconfinement phase transition is based on an order parameter related to the polyakov loop variable , see eq .  .",
    "the negative logarithm of the polyakov loop expectation value @xmath121 can be interpreted as the free energy of a single static color source in the fundamental representation of the gauge group @xcite . in this sense ,",
    "an infinite free energy associated with confinement is indicated as @xmath122 , whereas @xmath123 signals deconfinement . for gauge groups with a nontrivial center",
    ", @xmath124 measures whether center symmetry is realized by the ensemble under consideration @xcite . as @xmath124 transforms nontrivially under center transformations a center - symmetric ( disordered ) ground state automatically ensures @xmath125 , whereas deconfinement @xmath126 is related to the breaking of this symmetry , pointing to an ordered phase .",
    "the background - field formalism used in this work allows us to fix the fluctuations with respect to landau - dewitt gauge and simultaneously maintain gauge invariance for the background field @xmath53 which we relate to the polyakov loop in the following manner : we use the polyakov gauge  @xcite by gauge - rotating the background field into the cartan subalgebra and imposing @xmath127 . from the knowledge of @xmath128 ,",
    "the value of the corresponding polyakov loop @xmath129 $ ] can immediately be inferred .",
    "once the effective action @xmath130 $ ] is constructed within the background - field formalism , the minimum of the action represents the expectation value of the fluctuating quantum field , @xmath131 .",
    "the corresponding polyakov - loop value then is @xmath132 = l[{\\langle \\mathsf{a}_0\\rangle}]$ ] .    in addition to @xmath124 ,",
    "also @xmath133 $ ] serves as an order parameter for confinement : first , @xmath133 $ ] is an upper bound for the polyakov loop expectation value due to the jensen inequality , @xmath133\\geq \\langle l [ \\mathsf{a}_0]\\rangle$ ] , and therefore is nonzero in the deconfined phase .",
    "second , it has been shown in @xcite that @xmath133 $ ] vanishes identically in the center - symmetric phase where also @xmath134 \\rangle=0 $ ] .",
    "we conclude that together with @xmath133 $ ] also @xmath135 is an order parameter for center symmetry and confinement in the polyakov gauge . in the following ,",
    "we indeed concentrate on the effective potential @xmath136 for this order parameter .",
    "let us now recapitulate the confinement criterion put forward in ref .",
    "this criterion relates the ir behavior of gluon and ghost 2-point functions to the effective potential for the order parameter @xmath9 , starting from the full flow as displayed in eq .  .",
    "the following simplified analytical discussion is based on the assumption that the second term in eq .",
