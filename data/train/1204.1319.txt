    "the color glass condensate ( cgc ) formalism has been successfully applied to many processes in high energy collisions involving at least one hadron or nucleus in the initial state .",
    "examples are structure functions ( inclusive and diffractive ) in deeply inelastic scattering of electrons on protons or nuclei , and particle production in proton - proton , proton - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus collisions , for a recent review see ref.@xcite . the predicted suppression of @xmath2 for the single inclusive hadron production in deuteron - nucleus ( da ) collisions as well as the disappearance of the away side peak in di - hadron angular correlations in the forward rapidity region of rhic  @xcite are two of most robust predictions of the formalism which have been confirmed @xcite , see also refs.@xcite .",
    "the cgc formalism has been also successful in providing predictions for the first lhc data @xcite in proton - proton ( pp ) and nucleus - nucleus collisions @xcite",
    ". nevertheless , there are more recent , alternative phenomenological approaches which combine nuclear shadowing , transverse momentum broadening and cold matter energy loss to describe the rhic data  @xcite .",
    "therefore , one needs to consider other observables which may help clarify the underlying dynamics of forward rapidity particle production at small @xmath0 .",
    "inclusive prompt photon production  @xcite and prompt photon - hadron angular correlations  @xcite in the forward rapidity region are two such examples .",
    "furthermore , there are advantages to studying prompt photon production as compared to hadron production .",
    "it is theoretically cleaner ; one avoids the difficulties involved with description of hadronization of final state quarks and gluons , usually described by fragmentation functions valid at high transverse momentum .",
    "also , one does not have to worry about possible initial state - final state interference effects which may be present for hadron production . in case of photon - hadron vs. di - hadron angular correlations ,",
    "again the underlying theoretical understanding is more robust . unlike di - hadron correlations which involve higher number of wilson lines  @xcite",
    ", photon - hadron correlations depend only on the dipole cross section properties of which are well understood .",
    "both processes have been investigated previously , albeit not in detail and only in a limited kinematic range @xcite , see also refs.@xcite . in this work ,",
    "we extend the existing results for inclusive prompt photon production by clearly separating the contribution of direct and fragmentation photons .",
    "we show that direct photons are more sensitive to gluon saturation effects in the kinematics regions considered .",
    "we then investigate the dependence of prompt photon - hadron azimuthal angular correlations on high gluon density effects and show that gluon saturation effects lead to disappearance of the away side peak .",
    "the effect is very similar to the disappearance of the away side peak in di - hadron correlations observed in the forward rapidity region of rhic in da collisions  @xcite .",
    "therefore , a measurement of this correlation at rhic and the lhc would greatly help to clarify the role of cgc in the dynamics of particle production at high energy .",
    "the advantage of the cgc formalism over the more phenomenological models is that the cross section for many of these processes have the same common ingredient  @xcite , the dipole total cross section ; the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude of a quark - antiquark dipole on a proton or nucleus target . its rapidity ( energy ) dependence is governed by the b - jimwlk / bk evolutions equations  @xcite and is pretty well - understood .",

    ", the projectile is treated in the collinear factorization , and therefore the photon radiation from quark at this level has the standard features of pqcd , including the back - to - back correlation in the transverse momentum . as a result of multiple scatterings , the quark acquires a transverse momentum comparable with the saturation scale , the only relevant scale in the system , and the intrinsic angular correlations are washed way .    in",

    "it is clear that the away - side prompt photon - hadron cross - section ( at @xmath141 ) is suppressed for the bigger saturation scale ( corresponding to a denser system ) .",
    "it is also seen from that @xmath128 is very sensitive to the initial saturation scale .",
    "unfortunately , this bring rather large theoretical uncertainties .",
    "however , as we will show in the following the suppression of the way - side correlations seems to be a robust feature of our results and it less depends on our theoretical uncertainties .    in",
    "we show the relative azimuthal correlations obtained from the rcbk solution for a fixed initial saturation scale @xmath142 and @xmath143 at forward rapidities @xmath133 at rhic @xmath107 tev for two different kinematics windows of transverse momenta : we show in top panel , the results with a fix transverse momentum of prompt photon @xmath144 gev at different transverse momentum of produced hadron , and in down panel , with a fixed transverse momentum of hadron @xmath135 gev but at various transverse momentum of the produced prompt photon .",
    "it is seen , the relative azimuthal correlation is suppressed at @xmath145 as the transverse momentum of the produced hadron or prompt photon decreases and becomes comparable to the actual saturation scale of the system .",
    "this is the case regardless which of two transverse momenta of the hadron or prompt photon decreases . in lower panel",
    ", it is seen that when the prompt photon transverse momentum becomes comparable with the saturation effect the away - side azimuthal angular correlation of photon - hadron completely washes away .",
    "the same effect happens at lower transverse momentum of the produced hadron .",
    "this is simply because of fragmentation effect namely the transverse momentum of the produced parton ( that should be compared with the saturation scale ) is higher than the transverse momentum of the fragmented hadron .",
    "again , the suppression of away - side correlations is clearly due to the saturation effect since as we lower the transverse momentum of the produced particle , the system of hadron - photon become more sensitive to the small - x gluon saturation .",
    "note that the hadron - photon cross - section in has collinear singularity .",
    "therefore for a proper investigation of the correlations at @xmath146 , in principle , one should first extract the collinear singularity in a same fashion as demonstrated in section ii by introducing the quark - photon fragmentation function .",
    "therefore , our results at near - side @xmath147 should be less reliable .",
    "nevertheless , we expect that the sensitivity to the collinear singularity effect should drop out in the correlation defined in via normalization .",
    "we checked that contrary to the away - side correlations , the near - side peak is not sensitive to the saturation physics as the correlations does not change with varying the density of the system , see also .    in order to further understand the relative sensitivity of the away side peak to saturation dynamics , in , @xmath128 we compare at various energies at rhic and the lhc for a fixed transverse momentum of",
    "the produced prompt photon @xmath135 gev and hadron @xmath136 gev at rapidity @xmath133 .",
    "it is clear that the away side peak goes away as one increases the energy .",
    "again this is due to the fact that as we increase the energy , the gluon density increases and non - linear gluon recombination or the saturation effect becomes important . from , it is obvious that at the lhc the away - side azimuthal correlations of photon - hadron will be strongly suppressed .",
    "we conclude that the suppression of the away - side azimuthal photon - hadron correlations defined via , with decreasing the transverse momentum of the produced prompt photon or hadron , or increasing the energy , or increasing the size / density of system , all uniquely can be explained within the universal picture of gluon saturation without invoking any new parameters or ingredients to our model .",
    "we have investigated prompt photon production and prompt photon - hadron azimuthal angular correlations in proton - proton and proton - nucleus collisions using the color glass condensate formalism . we have provided predictions in the kinematic regions appropriate to rhic and the lhc experiments . we have shown that single inclusive and direct prompt photon production cross section in p(d)a collisions at forward rapidities at both rhic and the lhc is suppressed , as compared to normalized production cross section in proton - proton collisions . at rhic , a good portion of the predicted suppression is due to the projectile being a deuteron rather than a proton .",
    "this suppression is larger at the lhc compared to rhic which is even more impressive given that the projectile at the lhc is a proton .",
    "we showed that direct photon production is most affected by gluon saturation effects in the target nucleus than the fragmentation photons .",
    "however , at the lhc energies at forward rapidities the nuclear modification suppression for direct , fragmentation and inclusive prompt photon production is rather similar .",
    "we showed that the nuclear modification factor @xmath90 for inclusive prompt photon production at rhic and the lhc is a sensitive probe of small - x dynamics .",
    "we note that our results based on gluon saturation dynamics and using the color glass condensate formalism are different from those coming from the collinear factorization @xcite",
    ". therefore , @xmath90 measurement at rhic and the lhc is a crucial test of different factorization schemes , see also refs.@xcite for other observables .",
    "we have also studied prompt photon - hadron azimuthal angular correlations in kinematic regions which can be probed by rhic and the lhc experiments .",
    "it is shown that the away side peak in photon - hadron angular correlation goes away as one lowers the final state particle s momenta , very similarly to the disappearance of the away side peak in di - hadron correlations in forward rapidity da collisions at rhic . at fixed transverse momenta , the suppression of the away side peak gets stronger as one goes to larger rapidities ( more forward ) or higher energy or denser system as expected , due to stronger saturation effects in the target nucleus .",
    "presently , we are not aware of any alternative approach which leads to this novel phenomenon .",
    "note that in contrast to the nuclear modification factor for prompt photon , the prompt photon - hadron azimuthal angular correlation defined via eq.([az ] ) is free from the isospin effect , and can be considered as a cleaner probe of saturation effect .",
    "finally , we emphasize that prompt photon - hadron azimuthal angular correlations suffers from much less theoretical uncertainties as compared to di - hadron azimuthal angular correlations and thus a measurement of this correlation would go a long way toward establishing the dominance of gluon saturation effects at small @xmath25",
    ".    it will be interesting to see what the predictions of pqcd - motivated models  @xcite are for photon - hadron azimuthal angular correlations . in these models",
    "one usually needs to combine models of higher twist shadowing , the cronin effect and cold matter energy loss in order to describe the data on single inclusive hadron production and di - hadron azimuthal angular correlations .",
    "the advantage of the cgc formalism is that the same framework can be used to describe nuclear shadowing of structure functions  @xcite at small @xmath0 and includes transverse momentum broadening ( the cronin effect )  @xcite .",
    "it does not however include cold matter energy loss due to longitudinal momentum transfer between the projectile and the target which may be important at the very forward rapidities .",
    "it is not clear at the moment how to calculate this effect from first principles qcd . even though this energy loss itself is small , due to steepness of the production cross section at forward rapidity",
    ", it can suppress the cross section significantly .",
    "the purpose of this appendix is to define the kinematics and derive the needed relations between various light - cone energy fractions which appear in the production cross sections used .",
    "this is slightly different from the standard relations used in production cross sections based on collinear factorization theorems of pqcd .",
    "we first consider scattering of a quark on the target where a photon and a quark are produced , depicted in fig .  1 , q(p ) a ( p_a)(k ) q(l ) x , where @xmath11 is a label for the multi - gluon state , described by a classical field representing a proton or nucleus target . in the standard pqcd ( leading twist )",
    "kinematics , only one parton from the target interacts .",
    "this is not the case here since the target is described by a classical gluon field representing a multi - gluon state with intrinsic momentum rather than an individual gluon with a well defined energy fraction @xmath25 and zero transverse momentum .",
    "nevertheless , since most of the gluons in the target wave function have momentum of order @xmath148 , one can think of the state describing the target as being labeled by a ( four ) momentum @xmath149 . in this sense ,",
    "the gluons in the target collectively carry fraction @xmath25 of the target energy and have intrinsic transverse momentum denoted @xmath150 .",
    "this also means that there is no integration over @xmath25 in our case unlike the collinearly factorized cross sections in pqcd ( this basically corresponds to setting @xmath25 equal to the lower limit of @xmath25 integration in pqcd cross sections ) .",
    "we thus have @xmath151 where @xmath152 are the momenta of the incoming projectile , target and the produced hadron respectively .",
    "( pseudo)-rapidities of the produced quark and photon are related to their energies via @xmath153 imposing energy - momentum conservation at the partonic level via @xmath154 and using leads to @xmath155 the above relations and ( and the on mass shell condition ) can be used to derive the following expressions for the energy fractions @xmath156 .",
    "we obtain , @xmath157 where the final hadron transverse momentum and rapidity are denoted by @xmath27 and @xmath158 , and we used @xmath159 . note that light - cone momentum fraction @xmath25 appears in the dipole forward scattering amplitude @xmath19 whereas @xmath13 is the fraction of the projectile proton ( deuteron ) carried by the incident quark , see . to derive an expression for the lower limit of @xmath31 integration in , we note that @xmath160 . using the relation between the minus components of the four momenta given above ,",
    "we get x_q = k^- + .",
    "the minimum value of @xmath31 occurs when @xmath13 is maximum , i.e. , @xmath161 .",
    "we then have z_f^min = q^- - k^- , which can be written in terms of the transverse momenta and rapidities of the final state hadron and photon as z_f^min = e^_h 1 - e^_.    we now consider the kinematics of single inclusive photon production cross section .",
    "the cross section is obtained from by integrating over the final state quark momenta .",
    "this requires some care as we have now explicitly separated direct and fragmentation photons in . again using eqs.([a1 ] , [ a2 ] , [ a31 ] )",
    ", we obtain the following relation , x_g=(k_te^-_+ ) , [ xg1 ] where opposite to , we avoided to introduce @xmath158 and @xmath31 .",
    "one can use the energy - momentum delta functions in to obtain the following relation    , where the parameter @xmath114 is the fraction of energy of parton carried away by photon and it is defined as follows , z = e^_. in case of direct photons with transverse momentum @xmath52 , one should shift momentum @xmath36 in ( this is how we obtained the expersion ) . assuming that @xmath162",
    ", we get [ a6 ] |x_g = , where we have now used @xmath58 to denote the light cone momentum fraction of the target carried by gluons for production of direct photons so as to distinguish it from the momentum fraction involved in production of fragmentation photons . in the later case",
    ", the integration variable @xmath43 has been shifted twice . implementing the shifts in and noting that the @xmath43 integration in the fragmentation photon production cross section is dominated by its singularity at @xmath163 we get , for fragmentation photons , x_g=.    we are grateful to javier albacete for useful communications and for providing us with the latest tables for the numerical solution of rcbk equation .",

    "<S> we investigate inclusive prompt photon and semi - inclusive prompt photon - hadron production in high energy proton - nucleus collisions using the color glass condensate ( cgc ) formalism which incorporates non - linear dynamics of gluon saturation at small @xmath0 via balitsky - kovchegov equation with running coupling . for inclusive prompt photon production , we rewrite the cross - section in terms of direct and fragmentation contributions and show that the direct photon ( and isolated prompt photon ) production is more sensitive to gluon saturation effects . </S>",
    "<S> we then analyze azimuthal correlations in photon - hadron production in high energy proton - nucleus collisions and obtain a strong suppression of the away - side peak in photon - hadron correlations at forward rapidities , similar to the observed mono - jet production in deuteron - gold collisions at forward rapidity at rhic . </S>",
    "<S> we make predictions for the nuclear modification factor @xmath1 and photon - hadron azimuthal correlations in proton(deuteron)-nucleus collisions at rhic and the lhc at various rapidities . </S>"
