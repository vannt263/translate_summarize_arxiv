    "the geometric structure of bicn is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : geometry](a),(b ) . this new 2d material can be regarded as a freestanding high - buckled hexagonal bilayer bi film functionalized by the cyano groups(-cn ) from top and bottom sides .",
    "this functionalization will greatly modify the buckling structure and electronic properties as well .",
    "the optimized lattice constant of bicn is 5.54 @xmath5 and the buckling height of bi atoms is only 0.25 @xmath5 .",
    "the in - plane bond length of two nearest bi atoms is 3.21 @xmath5 and the out - plane bond length of bi and -cn is 2.23 @xmath5 . the computed phonon spectrum is shown in fig .  [ fig : geometry](c ) .",
    "there are eighteen phonon modes for six atoms in the unit cell , but for a better view we here just show ten phonon modes with the lowest frequency .",
    "the absence of imaginary vibrational frequency over the whole first brillouin zone ( fbz ) confirms the dynamic stability of this system .",
    "the thermodynamic stability is also confirmed by first principle molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations and the evaluation of formation energy .",
    "we use a 4@xmath64 supercell to perform the md simulation at 300k and 500k respectively .",
    "random chosen samples of geometric structure after md running for 2.3 ps are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : md ] .",
    "we can see the honeycomb of bi atom is well maintained at 300k while the -cn functional groups have a little swing due to the thermal perturbation .",
    "moreover , even at 500k , the structure of bicn is still unbroken .",
    "the formation energy of bicn is defined as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the total energy of bicn monolayer and @xmath9 are the chemical potential of bi , c , n atoms using bulk bismuth , diamond , nitrogen molecules , respectively .",
    "the @xmath10 are the numbers of bi , c , n atoms in the unitcell .",
    "the calculated formation energy of bicn is about -8.18 ev per unitcell , which is much larger then bich@xmath11(-0.52 ev per unitcell )  @xcite , bih(0.92 ev per unitcell )  @xcite , bif(-4.92 ev per unitcell )  @xcite , bicl(-2.04 ev per unitcell )  @xcite , and bii(-1.04 ev per unitcell ) . these indicate bicn has the most highly thermodynamic stability among the functionalized bismuth bilayers .      figure  [ fig : bs](a ) shows the bandstructures of bicn with soc ( red color ) and without soc ( black color ) . in the absence of soc ,",
    "the system is a graphene - like dirac semimetal with valence and conduction bands touching each other at the k ( k ) points in the fbz , forming dirac cone with isotropic linearly dispersion relation .",
    "the fermi level just crosses the dirac points and make it a typical dirac semimetal with the fermi velocity @xmath12 m / s .",
    "the atomic orbital projections of the band near the dirac points show that the main band components come from the @xmath13 orbitals of bi atoms .",
    "it is greatly different from that of graphene whose dirac cone is formed by the half - occupied @xmath14 orbital in a honeycomb structure . when soc is turned on , the original gapless dirac cone is opened and the system becomes a ti with a huge non - trivial gap of 1.28 ev at k point and indirect gap of 1.04 ev between conduction band maximum ( cbm ) at @xmath4 point and valence band maximum ( vbm ) at k point .",
    "due to the existence of space inversion symmetry for bicn system , we can simply calculate the topological invariant by the parity method proposed by fu and kane  @xcite .",
    "the topological invariant index @xmath15 indicates a topological trivial phase while @xmath16 means a topological nontrivial phase . here",
    "@xmath17 is define as @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the parity of the 2n@xmath21 occupied eigenstate at time - reversal invariant point ( trip ) @xmath22 , and n is the number of the kramers pairs of valence bands .",
    "the parity table of twelve pairs of the occupied valence bands at @xmath4 and three m points is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bs](b ) . from total parities we obtain topological index @xmath16 , which explicitly proves bicn to be a 2d ti .    for structures with a finite boundary ,",
    "2d tis have odd number pairs of helical edge states traversing the bulk band gap .",
    "these kinds of edge states can provide dissipationless conducting channels at boundary of a sample and be protected by the topological invariance . to further demonstrate the topological properties of bicn system we calculate the electronic structure of its zigzag nanoribbon with width of 5.44 nm ( n=12 ) . to eliminate the effect of dangling bonds on the edge ,",
    "the marginal bi atoms are saturated by hydrogen atoms .",
    "figure  [ fig : bs](c ) displays the bandstructure of the zigzag nanoribbon .",
    "we can clearly see one pair of edge state ( red lines ) traverse the bulk gap , cross each other and form a dirac point at the middle of 1d bz .",
    "each state of the pair transports in opposite direction with filtered spin due to the protection of time reverse symmetry . besides , the ribbon has two inversed - symmetric edges , so each edge state above has its degenerate copies for another edge .",
    "figure  [ fig : bs](d ) depicts the charge density distribution of edge states near the dirac point , which clearly shows they are well - localized along the edge of the ribbon .    in the following ,",
    "we build a four - band model to capture the low - energy physics of bicn .",
    "akin to the bilayer bi film with hydrogenated or halogenated from both sides  @xcite , the symmetry - adopted basis functions can be written as linear combination of @xmath23 and @xmath24 orbitals of bi atoms , i.e. @xmath25 , @xmath26 in the symmetric bicn , with two distinct sites a and b in a unit cell , and @xmath27 as valley index ( k or k ) .",
    "expanding the hamiltonian to the first order of k around k ( k ) point , the symmetry - allowed four - bands low - energy effective model involving soc can be written as @xmath28 where pauli matrix @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 denote a , b sublattices , valley index , and spin respectively .",
    "the second term is the on - site soc , which exactly plays a crucial role to develop a topological nontrivial phase with a giant gap .",
    "the above low - energy effective hamiltonian is invariable under the space inversion operation and the time reversal operation .",
    "the only two parameters @xmath12 m / s and @xmath32 ev are determined by fitting with the dft calculations .    so far we have demonstrated bicn to be a new kind of 2d tis , and clarified the related physics . there are some advantages need to be emphasized here .",
    "firstly , bicn is saturated by cyano groups(-cn ) on both sides , which may protect it from being destroyed by environment .",
    "secondly , the giant non - trivial band gap is induced by the on - site soc of bi , very robust against the external strain and electric field as well as finite temperature ( details at part ii and i of supplemental material ) .",
    "thirdly , the large gap of 1.04 ev can effectively suppress the emergence of heat - activated carriers from bulk state and ensure the realization of qsh effects at room temperature .",
    "besides , the giant gap will facilitate the localization of edge states and avoid the coupling of the edge states from different edges for narrow nanoribbons  @xcite .",
    "last , with graphene - like hexagonal structure , the electronic structure of bicn is valley related , which may have broad applications in valleytronics .",
    "recently several 2d tis are predicted , such as low - buckled silicene  @xcite , stanene  @xcite , bilayer - bi film  @xcite and so on .",
    "however , for practical applications , these predicted 2d materials must be placed or grown on a substrate , which would influence the electronic structure and topological properties of the hosts  @xcite .",
    "so we specifically consider bicn and its allotrope @xmath33bicn on monolayer h - bn and mos@xmath2 .",
    "( here @xmath33bicn can be regarded as a bilayer bi film passivated by -cn from oneside not both sides shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : geo - sub](c),(d ) .",
    "detailed properties are provided in part iii of supplemental material ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : geo - sub ] we construct four heterostructures composed of bicn/@xmath33bicn and the substrates with structural mismatches less than 5@xmath34 .",
    "the lattice constants of the substrates are fixed and the interlayer distances and atomic positions are relaxed to reach lowest energy structures with the vdw corrections .    to understand the interactions between bicn/@xmath33bicn and the substrates , the adsorption energies , denoted as e@xmath35=e@xmath36-e@xmath37-e@xmath38 , are evaluated ( where e@xmath36 , e@xmath37 , and e@xmath38 are energies of the composite system , substrate , and bicn/@xmath33bicn respectively ) . here",
    "we calculate the dependence of the total energy e on the interlayer distance d with respect to the e@xmath39 and d@xmath39 at the equilibrium state , as plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : formation - energy ] .",
    "when d - d@xmath40 grows large enough , the e@xmath41-e@xmath42 will converges to a constant value , which is exactly the value of e@xmath35 . based on our calculation , the adsorption energies for bicn on h - bn and mos@xmath2 are 7.78 and 8.82 mev/@xmath43 , which are close to the vdw interlayer binding energy of graphite  @xcite .",
    "the adsorption energies for @xmath33bicn on h - bn and mos2 are 17.78 and 22.88 mev/@xmath43 , which are smaller than that of mos@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "hence both can be regarded as typical vdw - type heterojuctions .",
    "comparing the bicn and @xmath33bicn on substrates , the former has relatively smaller adsorption energy . because both sides of the bi layer in bicn are protected by saturated -cn , which has weak interlayer interaction with substrates .",
    "for the @xmath33bicn case , since the bi layer directly faces to the substrates , it has relatively stronger interlayer interaction than the former , but still in the vdw range .",
    "electronic structures for the four systems are listed in fig .",
    "[ fig : substrate - band](e)-(h ) .",
    "the red dot line represents the bands from bicn/@xmath33bicn and the black bands are derived from the substrates . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : substrate - band ] ( e ) and ( f ) , the bandstructures of bicn ( red ) and two substrates ( black ) bn and mos@xmath2 are separated without being mixed .",
    "the shape of band from bicn layer in the composite system is the same as its pristine bandstructure in the same supercell , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : substrate - band](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "they are the same as the case of @xmath33bicn on mos@xmath2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : substrate - band](d ) and ( h ) ) .",
    "thus the topological properties of the bicn on these substrates still keep invariant .",
    "it should be noticed that the fermi level crosses the valence band and conduction band from different parts of the heterojuctions and the whole systems become metallic . however",
    "we ll show that the metallic property is mainly caused by the large work function difference of bicn/@xmath33bicn and the substrates , and the insulating property will recover when implying a proper gate voltage .",
    "the detailed process is discussed in part iv of supplemental material .",
    "the bandsturcture of the @xmath33bicn layer are well - located and almost intact at middle of the large band gap of substrate h - bn , and as shown in fig  [ fig : substrate - band ] ( g ) and ( c ) , which indicate it is an ideal topological insulating vdw heterostructure .",
    "based on dft calculation , we predict that bicn , i.e. , bilayer bi film passivated with -cn group , is a novel stable 2d bi - based material , and demonstrate that it is also a new kind of 2d ti with giant soc gap ( @xmath0 ev ) by direct calculation of the topological invariant and clear plot of the helical edge states .",
    "moreover , the low - energy effective hamiltonian is given , and two candidate substrates are proposed .",
    "dft calculation shows that the two substrates can stabilize and weakly interact with bicn via vdw interaction and thus do not affect the electronic properties , especially the band topology of bicn monolayer .",
    "bilayer bi film with a buckling honeycomb lattice has been manufactured through molecular - beam epitaxy  @xcite , and the topological edge states are observed as well  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "chemical functionalization of such 2d materials is a powerful tool to create new materials with desirable features .",
    "although many cyanides are toxic , there are some environment friendly cyanation reagents , for example , application of a new catalytic system for cyanation reaction of various aryl halides using k@xmath44[fe(cn)@xmath45 as cyanating source has been feasible experimentally  @xcite , which indicates that k@xmath44[fe(cn)@xmath45 could also provide cn- group for the manufacture of bicn . therefore , it is very promising that bicn may be synthesized by chemical reaction in solvents or by exposure of bilayer bi film to atomic or molecular gases .",
    "2d tis have been proved to be strong against disorder as long as @xmath46 gauge symmetry , and @xmath47 symmetries are respected on average .",
    "breaking any symmetry may induce an exotic phenomenon .",
    "a spontaneous magnetization can break @xmath47 symmetry and yield two valley - polarized quantum anomalous hall phases with a chern number from -1 to 1 , tunable by an external magnetic field orientation  @xcite .",
    "a proximity coupling to a superconductor can break @xmath46 gauge symmetry producing a @xmath1 topological superconductor with a majorana kramers pair  @xcite .",
    "our first principle calculations are carried out by the vasp ( vienna ab - initio simulation package )  @xcite within the generalized - gradient approximation ( gga ) of perdew , burke , and ernzerhof ( pbe )  @xcite .",
    "the cutoff energy of plane wave basis is set as 500 ev for the calculations .",
    "the k - meshes of @xmath48 and @xmath49 are set for 2d unit cell and 1d nanoribbon calculations , respectively .",
    "the structures are relaxed with remaining force on each atoms less than 0.01ev/@xmath5 and the self - consistent calculations are converged with energy difference less than 1 mev / atom for two successive steps .",
    "a vacuum layer of 18 @xmath5 was included in z direction to avoid the interaction of its periodic image .",
    "the phonon spectrum is calculated by quantum espresso  @xcite .",
    "the biaxial strain is implied by the change of lattice constant .",
