    "lattice gauge theory predicts that at high temperatures / densities a new state of matter is formed , a plasma of quarks and gluons ( qgp ) @xcite .",
    "there is strong circumstantial evidence that in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions such a plasma is created for a short amount of time .",
    "it quickly expands and hadronizes .",
    "it is the main objective of the present experiments at the ultrarelativistic heavy ion colliders to study the properties of the qgp .",
    "the experiments of the last ten years at rhic as well as the first runs at lhc have revealed that the hadron multiplicities are compatible with the assumption that hadrons are produced in statistical equilibrium at a temperature compatible with the predictions of lattice gauge calculations for the chiral / confinement phase transition @xcite .",
    "therefore the hadrons which are formed from plasma constituents are only of very limited use for the understanding of properties of the qgp .    for the study of the properties of the qgp during its expansion one",
    "has to rely on probes which do not come to an equilibrium with the plasma constituents .",
    "high - momentum heavy hadrons , those which contain a charm or a bottom quark , are such a probe . due to the high energy required for their production",
    "heavy quarks are created in hard collisions during the initial phase of the reaction and do not annihilate in later phases  @xcite .",
    "the number of these collisions can be determined from the collision geometry and the initial momentum distribution of the heavy quarks can be calculated from perturbative qcd ( pqcd )  @xcite . during the expansion of the plasma the heavy quarks interact with the plasma constituents , light quarks and gluons , but their initial momentum distribution is so different from that of the plasma particles that they do not come to thermal equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "therefore , their final momentum distribution at hadronization contains the desired information on the properties of the plasma during its evolution and this information is transferred to the heavy hadrons whose kinematics is largely determined by that of the entrained heavy quark .",
    "the interpretation of the experimental ( open ) heavy flavor results is in reality a double challenge : one has to understand the elementary interaction of the heavy quarks with the plasma constituents but also the expansion of the plasma itself . for the same elementary interaction",
    "different expansion scenarios yield different results of the observables  @xcite .",
    "heavy quarks interact with the plasma constituents either by elastic collisions @xcite or by inelastic radiative collisions @xcite or both @xcite . whereas radiative collisions dominate the energy loss of light quarks , for the heavy quarks the relative importance of the elastic and of the radiative energy loss",
    "is debated .",
    "detailed calculations for an expanding plasma are not available yet and the approximate calculations , using a static plasma of a given length , indicate that both are of the same order of magnitude  @xcite .",
    "another complication for the judgement of the importance of the radiative energy loss is the landau pomeranchuck migdal ( lpm ) effect , which states that radiative collisions are not independent but that a second gluon can only be emitted after the first one is formed .    for energetic light quarks",
    "the lpm effect in an infinite medium with a constant temperature and with static scattering centers has been evaluated independently by zakharov  @xcite and by baier , dokshitzer , mueller , peign and schiff  @xcite .",
    "later it has been found that both approaches are identical  @xcite and the approach has been extended to an expanding medium by applying time - dependent transport coefficients @xcite or time - dependent parton densities  @xcite .",
    "more recently arnold , moore and yaffe  @xcite , using diagrammatic methods , extended these calculations to dynamical gauge fields .",
    "the influence of the lpm effect for heavy quarks in a static medium is , however , presently still under debate and the calculation of how it shows up in an expanding medium whose temperature is rapidly changing is a theoretical challenge which has not been met yet .",
    "a while ago we have advanced a pqcd - inspired calculation for the elastic collisions of heavy quarks with the qgp constituents which employs a running coupling constant and an infrared regulator which reproduces the energy loss of the heavy quarks in the hard thermal loop approach  @xcite .",
    "embedding these cross sections in the hydrodynamical description of the expanding plasma of heinz and kolb  @xcite we could show that the collisional energy loss underpredicts the measured energy loss of heavy mesons at large momenta as well as their elliptic flow by roughly a factor of two .",
    "it is the purpose of this article to provide the basis for an extension of our pqcd calculation toward the calculation of the radiative energy loss .",
    "some preliminary considerations have been published in @xcite , where the calculation of @xcite for the radiative cross section was extended to the case of a collision implying one heavy quark . in  @xcite , it is argued that for heavy quarks of intermediate energy , those which constitute the bulk of the production at rhic and lhc , the gluon formation - time is strongly reduced by mass effects , so that coherence effects can be discarded in first approximation . in this respect ,",
    "we offer a complementary viewpoint to the works of  @xcite where heavy quarks are assumed to be ultrarelativistic and where the phase space boundaries are not of primary importance .",
    "the same viewpoint will be adopted in the present work in order to deduce and study the radiative cross section that will be later implemented in our monte carlo simulations in the same spirit as  @xcite .",
    "the colliding light partons will be naturally considered as genuine dynamical degrees of freedom ",
    "see @xcite as well  and not as fixed scattering centers , as it was the case in most of the aforementioned works .    starting out in section  [ sec : model ] from the standard qcd radiation matrix elements we calculate the gluon emission cross section for the collisions of a heavy quark with a light quark .",
    "the complexity of this result can be substantially reduced by realizing that matrix elements can be regrouped into three gauge invariant subgroups out of which one is dominating the energy loss .",
    "we then establish that pqcd and scalar qcd ( sqcd ) give only slightly different results as far as the energy loss of the heavy quark in a single collision is concerned .",
    "therefore we continue our calculation in the sqcd approach which allows to compare our results with previous work of gunion and bertsch for the light quark sector  @xcite .",
    "we then discuss in section  [ sec : gluon_distribution ] the radiated gluon distribution and in particular the `` dead cone '' effect , the suppression of almost collinear gluon emission .",
    "this effect has been proposed a while ago by dokshitzer and kharzeev  @xcite .",
    "we show that the emission of gluons with a small traverse momentum ( with respect to the direction of the incoming quark ) is reduced but remains finite as soon as this effect is calculated with gauge invariant matrix elements . in section  [ sec : rad_cross_section ] we calculate the fractional radiative energy loss cross section @xmath0 as well as its integral over @xmath1 entering the calculation of the radiative energy loss @xmath2 ; we pay a particular attention to the kinematic region for which @xmath3 but @xmath4 not @xmath5 , relevant for production of heavy quarks at intermediate @xmath6 in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions at rhic and lhc . in section  [ sec : gluon_mass ] we extend the model by introducing a finite gluon mass , as done in a number of phenomenological approaches to study heavy ion collisions .",
    "we study in detail the influence of such a mass for the radiative energy loss . in section [ sec : energy_loss ] , we then provide a comparison of radiative and collisional energy loss . in an upcoming publication",
    "we will embed these results into a numerical simulation of the radiative and collisional energy loss using the hydrodynamical expansion scenario of ref .",
    "preliminary results for this approach have been presented recently  @xcite .",
    "the starting point of our calculation are those five qcd bremsstrahlung diagrams which are of the order of @xmath7 and describe the creation of a gluon of 4-momentum @xmath8 in a collision between a heavy quark @xmath9 with mass @xmath10 and incoming ( outgoing ) 4-momentum @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) and a light quark @xmath13 taken as massless with incoming ( outgoing ) 4-momentum @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) which is part of the plasma .",

    "<S> employing scalar qcd we study the gluon emission of heavy quarks created by the interaction with light quarks considered as dynamical scattering centers . </S>",
    "<S> we develop approximation formulas for the high energy limit and study when the full calculation reaches this high energy limit . for zero quark masses and in the high energy limit our model reproduces the gunion - bertsch results . </S>",
    "<S> we justify why scalar qcd represents a good approximation to the full qcd approach for the energy loss of heavy quarks . in the regime of accessible phenomenology </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the emission at small transverse momentum ( dead cone effect ) is less suppressed than originally suggested . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate the influence of a finite gluon mass on the discussed results . </S>"
