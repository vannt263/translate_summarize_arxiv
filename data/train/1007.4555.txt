    "the current state of knowledge of planets around intermediate - mass ( @xmath6  ) stars is reminiscent of the general knowledge of exoplanets in 2001 . at that time",
    "there were 32 planets known , mostly orbiting sun - like stars .",
    "the distributions of semimajor axes and masses ( ) of these early exoplanet discoveries , drawn from the exoplanet orbit database[multiblock footnote omitted ] , are shown in figure  [ fig : firstplanets ] , illustrating the prevalence of giant planets in unexpectedly close - in orbitshere seems to be no compelling reason why the ... planets should not , in some instances , be much closer to their parent star than is the case in the solar system .",
    "it would be of interest to test whether there are any such objects . ''",
    "@xcite ] . as of 2010 may there are 31 planets known to orbit intermediate - mass stars ( @xmath7  ) , and the semimajor axes of planets in this new class was surprising , but for a different reason : there are no planets orbiting closer than 0.6  au @xcite . as @xcite showed , the planet populations orbiting host stars on either side of 1.5  are distinct at the 4-@xmath8 level .",
    "close - in , jovian planets are relatively easy to detect using radial velocities because of the larger amplitude they induce and the increased number of orbit cycles per observing time baseline .",
    "their absence therefore can not be due to an observational bias given the large population of planets at longer periods .",
    "instead , it appears that stellar mass has a dramatic effect on the semimajor axis distribution of planets .",
    "however , it is not clear whether this effect is a reflection of the process of planet formation and migration , or instead related to the effects of the evolution of the host stars",
    ".    stellar evolution may be an important factor because doppler surveys of intermediate - mass stars are largely restricted to post - main - sequence targets . while massive , main - sequence stars are poor doppler targets due to their rapid rotation (  @xmath9  ; @xcite ) , their evolved counterparts on the giant and subgiant branches are much slower rotators (  @xmath10  ) and therefore have the narrow absorption lines required for precise doppler measurements . however , as stars evolve their atmospheres expand and may encroach upon the orbits of their planets .",
    "simulations by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite have suggested that the engulfment planets by the expanding atmospheres of stars can account for the lack of close - in planets around k - giants and clump - giants ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "while doppler surveys have encountered a barren region around a stars inward of 0.6  au , transit surveys have discovered two examples of hot jupiters around intermediate - mass stars .",
    "ogle2-tr - l9 and wasp-33 are 1.5  stars orbited by jovian planets with semimajor axes @xmath11  au and 0.026  au , respectively @xcite .",
    "these detections demonstrate that close - in planets exist around a - type dwarfs , adding additional concern that the lack of planets close to evolved intermediate - mass stars is the result of stellar engulfment .",
    "unfortunately , the complicated observational and selection biases inherent to ground - based , wide - field transit surveys make it difficult to measure accurate occurrence rates that can be meaningfully compared to those measured from doppler surveys @xcite .    among the various types of evolved stars ,",
    "subgiants offer a unique view of the population of hot jupiters around intermediate - mass stars .",
    "the radii of subgiants have inflated by only a factor of @xmath12 compared to their main - sequence values .",
    "the simulations of @xcite show that planets with @xmath13  au should be safe from the tidal influence of stars near the base of the rgb ( see their figure 2 ) .",
    "it is only after stars start to ascend the rgb and have their radii expand to an appreciable fraction of an au that tidal influences become important .",
    "the occurrence rates and semimajor axis distribution of close - in planets around subgiants should therefore be representative of the properties of planets around a - type dwarfs .",
    "we are conducting a doppler survey of intermediate - mass subgiants at keck and lick observatories to study the effects of stellar mass on the physical properties and orbital architectures of planetary systems .",
    "our survey has resulted in the detection of 14 planets around 12 intermediate - mass ( @xmath14  ) stars , and 4 additional planets around less - massive subgiants ( * ? ? ?",
