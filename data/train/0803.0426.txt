    "galaxy formation scenarios must explain the rather uniform global properties of early - type galaxies as seen in the fundamental plane ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) while simultaneously accounting for the diversity seen in the internal kinematics and stellar populations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , the maps of the stellar kinematics of 48 elliptical and s0 galaxies from the sauron optical integral - field unit ( ifu ) have shown a wide variety of kinematic substructures , from large embedded discs to small counter - rotating cores ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "major mergers have been found to reproduce many of the kinematic substructures observed in the sauron maps without invoking post - merger star formation @xcite .",
    "however , many of the kinematically decoupled components ( kdcs ) in the sauron maps are very young @xcite , suggesting their stars formed in situ , and not as part of another galaxy .    over the past twenty years",
    ", it has been shown that e / s0s do have detectable amounts of cool and cold gas .",
    "cold dust was first found in the iras survey in which around 45% of ellipticals were detected in both the 60 and 100  @xmath4 m bands @xcite .",
    "molecular gas detections have often been biased toward dust - rich or infrared - bright galaxies , but two recent surveys do not select on these criteria and give detection rates of 28% for e / s0s in the sauron representative sample @xcite and 78% for s0s in a volume - limited sample @xcite . particularly interesting for substructure formation are the maps of cold molecular gas provided by interferometric co observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these maps often show rotating molecular gas discs on the same spatial scales as kdcs .",
    "while the current evidence indirectly connects molecular gas discs with young kdcs , the details of the connection are still unknown .",
    "do all molecular discs form stellar components ?",
    "do stars form everywhere in the molecular disc , or only in the densest regions ? does the regularity of the morphology of the molecular disc ( presumably indicating how long since the gas was accreted ) correlate with the age of the stars ? to answer these questions , we must compare the molecular gas morphology and kinematics to the stellar morphology , kinematics and ages in a spatially - resolved manner .",
    "this comparison requires interferometric co maps and optical ( or near - infrared ) ifu data for many individual galaxies . with this comparison in mind ,",
    "we have started to obtain co synthesis maps for the @xmath5 early - type sauron galaxies recently detected in co ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .    in this paper , we present the first co synthesis maps of ngc  2768 and compare the molecular gas to the stellar and ionised gas properties from sauron .",
    "ngc  2768 is classified as an e6 galaxy in rc3 @xcite , an s0 in the carnegie atlas of galaxies @xcite , and as a fast rotator in the recently proposed kinematic classification scheme of @xcite .",
    "@xcite first discovered both the polar orientation of the inner dust lane and the rotation of the ionized gas about the major axis , suggesting an external accretion origin for the dust and gas .",
    "ngc  2768 has a low - luminosity active galactic nucleus ( agn ) with a low - ionisation nuclear emission - line region ( liner ) spectrum @xcite , a compact radio core @xcite and an x - ray source consistent with being a point source @xcite .",
    "general properties of ngc  2768 are listed in table  [ tab : basic ] .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe the calibration and reduction of the data from the plateau de bure interferometer .",
    "section 3 presents flux measurements for the continuum data and channel maps , total intensity maps and velocity fields for the co line data . in section 4 , we discuss the origin and fate of the molecular gas and also consider the contributions to the mm continuum flux from the low - luminosity agn ( llagn ) and cold dust .",
    "we draw our conclusions in section 5 .",

    "the interferometric observations of the co(1 - 0 ) and co(2 - 1 ) lines presented here reveal a kiloparsec polar ring or disc of molecular gas within the early - type galaxy ngc  2768 .",
    "this molecular gas reveals the potential of this galaxy to form kinematic substructure through star formation .",
    "however , neither the kinematics nor the linestrengths of ngc  2768 as measured by sauron show clear evidence of a young stellar population .",
    "this limits any star formation coincident with the molecular gas to be very recent and/or too small a luminosity - weighted fraction of the background old stellar population to contribute to the linestrengths and kinematics .",
    "the asymmetric and unrelaxed nature of the co(1 - 0 ) emission suggests that the molecular gas in ngc  2768 was recently accreted and is possibly still being accreted , in agreement with the much more extended but disturbed h@xmath2i distribution .",
    "searching the neighbourhood of ngc  2768 for potential gas - donor galaxies , many h@xmath2i - rich low - luminosity galaxies are found , all of which could be the source of h@xmath2i seen in and around ngc  2768 , although ugc  4808 seems the most likely , being closest in projected distance and aligned with the extended h@xmath2i distribution .",
    "these co observations of ngc  2768 probe new regions of parameter space in terms of molecular gas in early - type galaxies , with recently accreted , polar - rotating gas of only @xmath6 m@xmath7 .",
    "as surveys have indicated lower co detection rates in higher - luminosity e and s0 galaxies @xcite , ngc  2768 is also notable for being the brightest in b - band of the co detections in @xcite . whether the lack of observed star formation has to do with the ( short ) time since the gas has been accreted , the ( low ) mass of molecular gas available for star formation , the polar dynamics of the gas , or some host - galaxy property will take more investigation to discover , including an analysis of the molecular gas distributions of other early - type galaxies with integral - field data .",
