    "the reconstruction of admittivies @xmath3 from electrical boundary measurements is known as the _ inverse admittivity problem_. the unknown admittivity appears as a complex coefficient @xmath4 in the generalized laplace equation @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the electric potential , @xmath7 is the conductivity of the medium , @xmath8 is the permittivity , and @xmath9 is the temporal angular frequency of the applied electromagnetic wave . the data is the dirichlet - to - neumann , or voltage - to - current density map defined by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the solution to . by the trace theorem @xmath12 .    in this work we present a direct reconstruction algorithm for the admittivity  @xmath3 .",
    "the majority of the theory is based on the 2000 paper by francini @xcite in which it is established that if @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a bounded domain in @xmath2 with lipschitz boundary , then the real - valued functions @xmath7 and @xmath8 are uniquely determined by the dirichlet - to - neumann map , provided that the imaginary part of the admittivity is sufficiently small .",
    "the proof in @xcite is based on the d - bar method and is nearly constructive , but equations linking the scattering transform and the exponentially growing solutions to the dirichlet - to - neumann data are not used in the proof , and so it does not contain a complete set of equations for reconstructing the admittivity . in this work , we derive the necessary equations for a direct , nonlinear reconstruction algorithm for the admittivity  @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , we establish the existence of exponentially growing solutions to , which prove to be useful in relating the dirichlet - to - neumann data to the scattering transform .",
    "the reconstruction formula in @xcite is for the potential  @xmath15 , whose relationship to  @xmath3 is described below .",
    "we provide a direct formula for  @xmath3 from the d - bar equations in @xcite , which is computationally advantageous as well .",
    "the inverse admittivity problem has an important application known as electrical impedance tomography ( eit ) .",
    "the fact that the electrical conductivity and permittivity vary in the different tissues and organs in the body allows one to form an image from the reconstructed admittivity distribution . in the 2-d geometry , eit is clinically useful for chest imaging .",
    "conductivity images have been used for monitoring pulmonary perfusion @xcite , determining regional ventilation in the lungs @xcite , and the detection of pneumothorax @xcite , for example . in three dimensions ,",
    "conductivity images have been used , for instance , in head imaging @xcite and knowledge of the admittivity has been applied to breast cancer detection @xcite .    reconstruction algorithms based on a least - squares approach that reconstruct permittivity include @xcite .",
    "the aforementioned algorithms are iterative , whereas the work presented here is a direct method that makes use of exponentially growing solutions , or complex geometrical optics ( cgo ) solutions , to the admittivity equation .",
    "the steps of the algorithm are to compute these cgo solutions from knowledge of the dirichlet - to - neumann map , to compute a scattering transform matrix , to solve two systems of @xmath16 ( d - bar ) equations in the complex frequency variable @xmath17 for the cgo solutions to a related elliptic system , and finally to reconstruct the admittivity from the values of these solutions at @xmath18 . in this work ,",
    "we provide a complete implementation of this algorithm and present reconstructions of several numerical phantoms relevant to medical eit imaging .",
    "the phantoms we consider here are discontinuous at the organ boundaries , which is actually outside the theory of the algorithm . the work @xcite contains computations of smooth admittivities and validates our formulas and computations by comparing the results of the intermediate functions ( cgo solutions and scattering transforms ) with those computed from knowledge of the admittivity .",
    "we briefly review the history of results using cgo solutions on the inverse conductivity problem in dimension 2 .",
    "the inverse conductivity problem was first introduced by a.p .",
    "caldern @xcite in 1980 , where he proved that , in a linearized version of the problem , the dirichlet - to - neumann map uniquely determines the conductivity , and he proposed a direct reconstruction method for this case .",
    "an implementation in dimension two for experimental data is found in @xcite . in 1996 ,",
    "nachman @xcite presented a constructive proof of global uniqueness for twice differentiable conductivities using d - bar methods .",
    "the d - bar algorithm following from @xcite has been applied to simulated data in @xcite and to experimental data on tanks and _ in vivo _ human data in @xcite .",
    "while the initial scattering transform was regularized using a born approximation , a more recent paper @xcite contains a full nonlinear regularization analysis , including estimates on speed of convergence in banach spaces , for twice differentiable conductivities .",
    "the regularity conditions on the conductivity were relaxed to once - differentiable in @xcite .",
    "the proof uses d - bar techniques and formulates the problem as a first - order elliptic system .",
    "a reconstruction method based on @xcite can be found in @xcite .",
    "francini @xcite provided a proof of unique identifiability for the inverse admittivity problem for @xmath19 , with @xmath9 small .",
    "her work provides a nearly constructive proof based on d - bar methods on a first - order elliptic system similar to that in @xcite . a non - constructive proof that applies to complex admittivities with no smallness assumption is found in @xcite .",
    "astala and pivrinta provide a cgo - based constructive proof for real conductivities @xmath20 and numerical results related to this work can be found in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : theory ] we describe the direct reconstruction algorithm , which is comprised of boundary integral equations for the exponentially growing solutions to involving the dirichlet - to - neumann data , boundary integral equations relating those cgo solutions and the cgo solutions @xmath21 of the first order system , equations for the scattering transform involving only the traces of @xmath21 , the @xmath22 equations established in @xcite , and the direct reconstruction formula for @xmath15 and thus @xmath3 .",

    "results on noisy and non - noisy simulated data of a cross - sectional chest with discontinuous organ boundaries are found in section [ sec : results ] .",

    "a useful link can be established through exponentially growing solutions to the admittivity equation . for @xmath63 with compact support , equation can be studied on all of @xmath2 , and introducing the complex parameter @xmath17 , two distinct exponentially growing solutions , which differ in their asymptotics , exist .",
