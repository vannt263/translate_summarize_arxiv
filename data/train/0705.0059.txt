    "it improves over conventional techniques such as neutron activation analysis ( naa ) , inductively - coupled plasma mass spectrometry ( icp - ms ) as well as secondary ion mass spectrometry ( sims ) , and has been successfully applied to a wide variety of disciplines like archeology , geology , environmental science , biomedicine , safeguards of nuclear materials and so on  @xcite .",
    "measurement of trace concentrations of naturally - occurring , as well as cosmic - ray or fission induced radioactive isotopes is an important technique with major impact to low background experiments  @xcite .",
    "the texono collaboration is pursuing a research program in low energy neutrino and astroparticle physics  @xcite .",
    "an important aspect is to devise procedures for measuring such trace radiopurity using the ams techniques .",
    "significant improvements in sensitivities and flexibilities over existing methods can be expected .",
    "results were published already for the measurement of trace @xmath16i  @xcite in inorganic crystal and organic liquid scintillator ( ls ) .",
    "the isotope @xmath16i is a long - lived fission fragment , where the corresponding ams procedures are already matured and well - established . in this article .",
    "we report on our efforts and results on potassium ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the isotope @xmath17 is stable and exists in large abundance in nature @xmath18 and there are no prior attempts to measure trace abundance of it with ams .",
    "these poses new experimental challenges and the results reported here represent advances in the field .",
    "potassium has three naturally - occurring isotopes : @xmath17 , @xmath0 and @xmath19k with isotopic abundances of 93.26% , 0.0117% and 6.73% , respectively . among these ,",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath19k are stable while @xmath0 has a half - live of @xmath20  years , where the dominant decay channels are : @xmath21 and @xmath22 both decays pose severe background problems to low - count - rate experiments where the signals are at the sub - mev energy range , such as the studies of pp and @xmath23be solar neutrinos , the searches of cold dark matter , as well as of neutrino magnetic moments with reactor neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "potassium contaminations in the active detector materials will give rise to a continuous @xmath24-decay background up to 1.31  mev , while those in the passive materials in the vicinity of the detector will produce @xmath25-rays at 1.46  mev which , after compton scatterings , can lead to background at the sub - mev range .",
    "the suppression and an efficient measurement technique of ultra - low amount of potassium in a wide spectrum of materials are therefore an issue of crucial significance . as an illustrative example , in order for the borexino and kamland experiments to achieve the goals of studying the low energy @xmath23be solar neutrinos with ls , the required contaminations of @xmath0 should be less than @xmath26  g / g .",
    "while the radioactive isotope of interest to low background experiments is @xmath0 , the ams techniques devised in this work are for the measurement of @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath17-to-@xmath0 ratio of 7971:1 is constant for naturally - occurring materials .",
    "therefore , a measurement of ultra - low @xmath0 radio - purities is equivalent to one on the level of @xmath17-contaminations , but with a sensitivity enhancement factor of almost @xmath27 .",
    "in addition , @xmath0 measurements by the ams techniques are vulnerable to background contaminations by @xmath28ca , a stable isotope which exists in abundance in nature .",
