    "as matter accretes from astrophysical disks onto a central body ( such as protostars , neutron stars , and black holes ) angular momentum is rapidly transported outward .",
    "this redistribution of angular momentum is far too rapid to be explained by collisional viscosity .",
    "it is believed that turbulence initiated and sustained by magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) plasma instabilities can be responsible for the enhancement of effective viscosity in accretion disks ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ; pringle 1981 ) .",
    "disks appear to be hydrodynamically linearly stable according to the rayleigh criterion .",
    "however , it is not clear whether through a nonlinear process a hydrodynamically stable flow can become turbulent , a topic that has been debated vigorously .",
    "recently , it has been shown experimentally that hydrodynamic turbulence in astrophysically relevant flows at reynolds numbers up to several million can not provide the required effective viscosity ( ji , burin , schartman & goodman 2006 ) .",
    "the ineffectiveness of hydrodynamic turbulence in transporting momentum has motivated the search for other instabilities that could yield enhanced viscosity .",
    "a candidate for such instability is the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) .",
    "the mri , originally studied by velikhov 1959 and chandrasekhar 1960 ,   was analyzed for astrophysical disks by balbus and hawley in the early 1990s ( balbus & hawley 1991 ) .",
    "they showed that a differentially rotating disk in the presence of weak magnetic field is mhd unstable .",
    "thus , under appropriate conditions , the mri can lead to turbulent momentum transport in disks ( see , e. g. , balbus & hawley 1998 , and the references therein ) .",
    "the momentum transport arises from maxwell or reynolds fluid stresses . in this paper",
    ", we investigate whether those stresses and momentum transport can be provided by a current - driven mhd instability , rather than through the flow - driven mri .",
    "in particular , we consider in depth a tearing instability , which is a resistive mhd instability , that causes magnetic reconnection and can persist in a strong magnetic field ( in regions in which the mri could be stabilized by the strong field ) .",
    "magnetic fields have long been considered to be prevalent in some disk regions , as well as to play a key role in jets emanating from disk regions .",
    "observational evidence is in hand for the existence of strong magnetic fields in disks , although the observations are limited . in recent years",
    ", direct measurements have shown strong evidence of magnetic field in protostellar disks .",
    "existence of a significant azimuthal magnetic field of about 1 kg has been confirmed by observations around fu orionis in the innermost regions of its accretion disk ( donati et al .",
    "the complex topology of magnetic field around stars during their formation has also be confirmed through observation and extrapolation of the reconstructed surface magnetic field .",
    "recent observation and analysis of magnetic field on the surface of classical t tauri stars ( ctts ) suggest strong octopolar field ( @xmath0 1.2 kg ) and smaller dipolar field ( @xmath0 0.35 kg ) ( donati et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "there is some indirect evidence of strong magnetic field in protosolar nebula based on the magnetization of primitive meteorites .",
    "it was suggested that an mhd nebular dynamo can generate a magnetic field with intensity of up to 10 g at the distance of a few astronomical units from the sun ( levy 1978 ) , and was shown that this magnetic field can produce flares in a nebular corona ( levy & araki 1989 ) , which may account for the magnetized meteorites .",
    "the source of large - scale magnetic fields of ctts could be the combination of fossil field ( from interstellar media ) and field generated through dynamo action ( donati et al .",
    "2007 ) . however , the source of large - scale magnetic field in disks is still unknown .",
    "large - scale magnetic fields in disks may be supplied externally and may also be generated through a kinematic alpha - omega dynamo ( reyes - ruiz & stepinski 1999 ; torkelssson & brandenburg 1994 ; rudiger , elstner & stepinski 1995 ) .",
    "mri can also produce a turbulent small - scale mhd dynamo ( brandenburg et al .",
    "1995 ; hawley et al .",
    "2001 ) , however , the generation of large - scale magnetic field by mri is not known to occur .",
    "based on the observational evidence of magnetic field and the modeling of self - generated large - scale magnetic field ( mhd dynamo ) in disks , we examine current - driven instabilities as a candidate for angular momentum transport in an mri stable magnetized disk with large currents .    in this paper , we explore the possibility of angular momentum transport in disks by current - driven instabilities in situations where mri is stable ( due to strong magnetic field ) and can not provide the required effective viscosity .",
    "we recognize three classes of situations that current - driven instabilities may be important in transporting angular momentum in astrophysical disks ; 1 ) in the inner disk region around a young magnetized protostar 2 ) in the innermost and active regions of weakly - ionized protostellar and protoplanetary disks 3 ) in the upper and lower surfaces layers of a protoplanetary disk and magnetized coronas .",
    "below we further discuss these situations .",
    "the strong and complex large - scale magnetic fields detected in protostellar disks can provide the free energy ( current ) for current - driven instability and magnetic reconnection in these systems .",
    "disk - star interaction and accreting matter to the stars along the complex magnetic field lines have been studied through mhd simulations by long , romanova & lovelace ( 2008 ) ( and the reference therein ) . however , with open and complex field lines attached to the disk observed at radii only up to several stellar radii and with disk differential rotation , magnetic reconnection may be important in the inner region of a disk close to a young protostar ( such as ctts ) and cause radial angular momentum transport .",
    "current - driven instabilities may also be important in protoplanetary and protostellar disks ( e.g. protosolar nebulas , disks around ctts ) .",
    "however , in weakly ionized protoplanetary disks , the magnetic field might not be well coupled to the gas throughout the whole disk .",
    "therefore , magnetic reconnection can only play a role in some parts of these disks which are thermally ionized ( the innermost region r@xmath10.1au ) or nonthermally ionized by cosmic rays ( in the outer active region ) .",
    "other possible candidates for momentum transport in disks are dynamo modes and flow - driven mri .",
    "the notion of angular momentum transport through magnetic stresses from the oscillating dynamo modes has been examined by stepinski & levy ( 1990 ) in a protostellar nebula in the absence of flow - driven mri turbulence .",
    "it was estimated that a magnetic field strength of @xmath2 g is needed for transport of angular momentum from protostar into a surrounding disk .",
    "torkelssson & brandenburg ( 1994 ) also found stronger magnetic torques from quadropolar dynamo solutions .",
    "the effectiveness of mri in transporting angular momentum transport in weakly - ionized disks is limited and strongly depends on the ionization factor .",
    "it has been shown that in the so - called dead zone between the active layers in protoplanetary disks , mri can not operate ( gammie 1996 ; fleming & stone 2003 ; zhu , hartmann & gammie 2010 ) .   however , including nonideal effects such as hall effect and ambipolar diffusion have shown to change the stability and the saturation of mri in weakly - ionized protoplanetary disks ( wardle 1999 ; balbus & terquem 2001 ; wardle 2007 ) .     in strongly magnetized coronas where mri is stable ,",
    "the role of current - driven instabilities can become significant .",
    "magnetic activity at the surface of the disks , possibly originated from the internal dynamos , may produce coronas , which can transport angular momentum vertically and radially . using local simulations ,",
    "miller & stone ( 2000 ) showed the generation of strongly magnetized corona ( force - free ) through an mri - driven turbulence originated in the core of a disk with initially weak magnetic field .",
    "they also investigated angular momentum transport from mri in a vertically extended local domain .",
    "however , the possibility of angular momentum transport in the strongly magnetized , mri stable force - free corona was not studied .",
    "theoretical models have also been developed to study the possibility of angular momentum transport by the coronal magnetic field ( goodman 2003 ; uzdensky & goodman 2008 ) .",
    "the current - driven instabilities can also become important in corona , upper and lower layers of protoplanetary disks , with significant currents , where mri neither operates in the core region ( dead zone ) nor is unstable in the coronas .    in this paper",
    ", we specify the equilibrium magnetic field ( and corresponding current density ) in disk geometry , which is chosen to be sufficiently strong that the flow - driven mri is stable .",
    "we then study current - driven instabilities . unlike flow - driven mri and pressure - driven interchange instabilities , which can be treated locally",
    ", current - driven instabilities are driven due to equilibrium gradients with scale length comparable to the global scale lengths .",
    "it is shown that gradients in global equilibrium parallel current provide the driving source for both ideal and resistive current - driven ( tearing ) instabilities .",
    "ideal current - driven instabilities are global modes ( with global velocity perturbations ) with fast alfvenic growth rates which are independent of resistivity . however , for tearing modes , resistivity is important in the vicinity of the radius at which the wave number parallel to the magnetic field vanishes ( i.e. , @xmath3 = k @xmath4 b / b = 0 ) .",
    "magnetic reconnection ( or tearing ) occurs at such radial locations .",
    "although the reconnection occurs locally in radius , the tearing modes are global in their radial extent .",
    "therefore , tearing modes are usually treated using asymptotic matching where solutions outside the reconnecting layer ( outer layer or ideal @xmath5 solutions ) are matched with the inner layer ( reconnecting layer @xmath6 ) solutions .",
    "we investigate the physics of momentum transport through three sets of calculations of increasing completeness .",
    "first , we perform linear stability analysis to establish conditions for instability and to investigate radial structure of the modes .",
    "second , through quasilinear analytic theory , we calculate the maxwell stress in the outer ideal region and show its dependence on the azimuthal flow shear and instability growth rate .",
    "we find that in the presence of azimuthal keplerian flow , the radial and azimuthal magnetic fluctuations are in phase and causes a nonzero maxwell stress for a single ( a single spatial fourier component ) current - driven mode and thus momentum transport .",
    "we also examine the structure of the stress for a single mode in the quasilinear regime .",
    "we show that the stress and the resulting momentum transport is localized to the vicinity of the reconnection layer . however , an ideal current - driven instability has a global maxwell stress , and therefore produces more global transport .",
    "third , we compute the simultaneous nonlinear evolution of multiple modes , each corresponding to different reconnection layers ( separated radially ) . with the inclusion of nonlinear mode coupling ,",
    "the maxwell stress becomes global , extending over the full plasma cross - section .",
    "we perform nonlinear computations which are 1 ) weakly nonlinear driven 2 ) strongly nonlinear driven . in the weakly nonlinear driven case , many current - driven modes are linearly unstable while the effect of nonlinear coupling to stable modes is weak . in the strongly nonlinear case however , many stable modes are nonlinearly driven by linearly unstable modes .",
    "it is shown that in the weakly nonlinear driven case , the nonlinear structure of maxwell stress is global mainly due to the growth of an ideal current - driven instability . however , in the strongly nonlinear case , the global structure of the maxwell stress is mainly due to the nonlinear coupling of many tearing modes .",
    "we also estimate the effectiveness of the current - driven instabilities for angular momentum transport using the standard shakura - sunyaev @xmath7 model for both the weakly nonlinear driven and strongly nonlinear driven cases .",
    "we find that maxwell stress is much larger for the strongly nonlinear case compared to the weakly nonlinear case and @xmath8 are about @xmath9 and @xmath10 for the weakly nonlinear driven and strongly nonlinear driven case , respectively .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the characteristics of momentum transport by current - driven instabilities and the model used are described in sections  [ sec : physics ] and [ sec : model ] , respectively .",
    "single mode calculations are presented in section [ sec : single ] . in section [ sec : single1 ] , equilibrium and linear stability analysis are described .",
    "analytical quasilinear calculation of maxwell stress and the structure of single mode in quasilinear regime are presented in section [ sec : analy ] .",
    "we present full nonlinear multiple mode computations in section [ sec : nonlin ] .",
    "multiple computations for a weakly nonlinear driven and a strongly nonlinear driven case are presented in sections [ sec : nonlin1 ] and [ sec : nonlin2 ] , respectively .",
    "we summarize in section [ sec : summ ] .",
    "the momentum transport caused by current - driven instability has the same origin in fluctuation - induced stresses as does the well - studied flow - driven mri . in that sense ,",
    "the mechanism for transport is the same , although the underlying mhd instability is different in its energy source and spatial structure .",
    "the change in flow is given by the mhd momentum equation @xmath11 for a rotating , cylindrical plasma we decompose the flow and magnetic fields into spatially mean and fluctuating quantities , where mean values ( denoted by @xmath12 ) are averaged over axial and azimuthal directions and fluctuating values subtract out the mean .",
    "if we then average the above equation over the axial and azimuthal directions we find @xmath13 which describes the time evolution of the mean flow which depends upon radius and time .",
    "we see that the mean flow can evolve from fluctuating flow ( arising from a reynolds stress , the first term on the rhs ) and fluctuating magnetic field ( the maxwell stress or lorentz force of the second term on the rhs ) .",
    "these terms , quadratic in the fluctuations , can be nonzero upon spatial averaging .",
    "mhd current - driven instabilities produce spatially fluctuating quantities that , through the reynolds and maxwell stress alter the radial profile of the axial and azimuthal mean flow .",
    "these forces can decrease the flow at one radius , while increasing it another , essentially transporting momentum radially . in this sense",
    ", the mechanism is identical to momentum transport from the well - studied magneto- rotational instability .",
    "crucial differences lie in the energy source , spatial structure , and dynamics of the underlying instabilities .",
    "the mri is a global ideal instability ( occurs at zero resistivity ) with the stresses acting globally in radius .",
    "the current - driven tearing instability also has an amplitude that is global in radius , but the forces on the rhs of the eq .",
    "[ eq : mom ] act locally in radius for a single instability . for a single tearing instability magnetic reconnection occurs at one radial location that for which the wavelength parallel to the equilibrium magnetic field becomes infinite ( biskamp 1993 ) .",
    "that is , the instability amplitude is constant along the helical magnetic field at this radius , although it varies in the azimuthal and axial directions .",
    "only the vicinity of this radius is electrical resistivity important .",
    "the resistive layer of narrow radial extent , within which reconnection occurs , functions as a boundary layer between two ideal regions . within this region amplitudes of velocity and current density can become large , leading to locally strong forces that alter flow .",
    "an additional difference between the mri and tearing instability is that momentum transport in the mri can be understood as the instability acting to diminish its energy source ( flow gradient ) . for the tearing instability",
    "the analogue is the reduction of the current density , which is a strong effect of the instability .",
    "reduction of the flow gradient can be viewed as a parasitic effect of the tearing mode .",
    "interestingly , the mri also alters the magnetic field ( ebrahimi , prager & schnack 2009 ) , so both instabilities alter the flow and field .",
    "we should note that an ideal current - driven instability despite having the same energy source as tearing instability , exhibits different characteristics .",
    "a major difference is that for an ideal current - driven instability ( with no reconnecting layer in the plasma volume ) , the fluctuation - induced forces are global as will be shown below .    the tearing mode , being a resistive instability , does not lend itself to simple analytic calculation of instability - induced transport",
    "however , in section  [ sec : analy ] , an analytic calculation of the transport is provided for the ideal region .",
    "we find that in the presence of azimuthal flow , the radial and azimuthal magnetic fluctuations are in phase and results in a non - zero maxwell stress .",
    "the resulting stress ( and the direction of angular momentum transport ) depends on the global equilibrium as well as the global radial mode structure .",
    "we therefore employ quasilinear computations to show the structure of stresses and outward momentum transport .",
    "it will be shown that the structure of the stresses for ideal current - driven and tearing modes are very different , therefore they can affect the momentum transport differently . with multiple tearing modes present , nonlinear three - wave interactions alter the structure of the modes and the forces broaden radially .",
    "throughout this work , we employ the mhd equations in doubly periodic @xmath14 cylindrical geometry for both the analytic and computational studies .",
