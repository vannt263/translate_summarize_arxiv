    "the da white dwarf non - radially pulsators stars , known as zz cet stars , have traditionally been found as isolated field objects . until recently 34 were known ( fontaine et al .",
    "2003 ) , but a further tranche of 34 were just announced ( d.  sullivan , this conference ) .",
    "the zz cet pulsation strip in the hr diagram roughly extends over the range 11000 k @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath0 12000 k ( bergeron et al .  1995 ) , so it is of interest to see whether cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) with temperatures in that range also show pulsations ( though the width and centre of gravity of the instability strip may be modified in the presence of accretion : townsley & bildsten 2003 ) .    until recently only one such hybrid cv / zz system was known : gw lib ( warner & van zyl 1998 ) , which has a measured @xmath1 of 14700 k ( szkody et al .",
    "2002a )  though this may be affected by non - allowance for the mysterious emission source that adds a 2.08 h photometric modulation independent of the 1.28 h orbital period ( woudt & warner 2002 ) .",
    "the principal periods in gw lib are near 650 s , 376 s and 236 s.    a second cv / zz system , sdssj161033.64 - 010223.3 ( sdss1610 hereafter ) , was discovered in june 2003 ( woudt & warner 2003 ) and was selected as a candidate on the basis of its spectrum as published in the first release of cvs in the sloan digital sky survey ( szkody et al .",
    "sdss1610 resembles gw lib in clearly showing absorption lines of the underlying white dwarf primary , as well as the emission lines characteristic of an accreting system .",
    "its light curve is shown in figure 1 ( top panel ) .",
    "its periodicities are near 607 s , 345 s and 221 s , with a harmonic at 304 s.    there is evidently a window of opportunity among the cvs of low rate of accretion ( @xmath2 ) : the @xmath1 of the white dwarf is determined by @xmath2 , largely through compressional heating in the interior ( sion 2003 ) , and it happens that an @xmath2 that maintains @xmath1 in the instability strip is sufficient to produce balmer emission lines but not too large to give the accretion disc a luminosity large enough to hide the flux from the white dwarf . from the observed depth of ,",
    "e.g. , h@xmath3 , the fraction of flux contributed by the white dwarf can be estimated ; for gw lib this is @xmath4 50% and in sdss 1610 it is even greater .",
    "the low @xmath2 in these systems automatically leads to the expectation that they will be dwarf novae of very long outburst interval @xmath5 ( see , e.g. , warner ( 1995 ) ) .",
    "comparison with z cha , which has @xmath6 50 d , shows that although the latter s primary is visible in the spectrum , it is far more covered by accretion disc flux than in the known cv / zz stars . at the other end of the @xmath5 range ,",
    "gw lib has only had one observed outburst ( in 1983 ) and sdss 1610 has had none . because the low @xmath2 systems are intrinsically faint they will in general be apparently faint  it is the ability of the sdss to find cvs to faint limits that has opened the possibility of increasing the number of known cv / zz stars .",
    "some of the zz cet stars show frequency patterns that have been ascribed to direct resonance between the principal driving modes and the wealth of other available modes ( odonoghue , warner & cropper 1992 ) .",
    "thus in vy hor , gd 154 and pg 1351 + 489 the eigenfrequencies are almost completely described by the sequence @xmath7 and @xmath8 , where @xmath9 = 1 , 2 , ... and @xmath10 = 0 , 1 , 2 , ... , and @xmath11 is a small quantity ( odonoghue , warner & cropper 1992 ; robinson et al .  1978 ; winget , nather & hill 1987 ) . for vy hor",
    "@xmath11 = 0.037 , for gd 154 @xmath11  =  0.03 and for pg 1351 @xmath11 = 0.03 . in gw lib and sdss1610 , with the still rather limited observational data for the latter , we find a similar situation , but with the sequences @xmath7 and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 for gw lib and @xmath14 for sdss1610 .",
    "this may be a coincidence , but it could indicate that a different resonance condition is operating in accreting zz cet stars .",
    "the publication of the second sdss cv release ( szkody et al .",
    "2003 ) revealed at least three further candidate cv / zz stars .",
    "we have observed sdssj013132.39 - 090122.3 and sdssj220553.98 + 115553.7 ( see also figure 1 ) and find that indeed both have zz cet primaries .",
    "at the time of writing this leaves the strong candidate sdss 1238 to be examined later in the observing season .",
    "the fourier transforms in figure 2 show that in sdss0131 the dominant periods are near 595 s and 335 s with weak oscillations also near 260 s ; sdss2205 has strong oscillations near 575 s and 330 s , with weak oscillations near 475 s. in both cases the ratio of the stronger periods is @xmath4 1.75 , as in gw lib and sdss1610 .",
    "the total number of cvs in the first two ssds releases is 60 , of which we have found that probably @xmath4 8% are cv / zz combinations .",
    "it is estimated that the final total of cvs found in the sdss will be @xmath4 400 ( szkody et al .",
    "2002b ) , so in a few years we may expect to have more than 30 cv / zz stars to study in detail .",
