    "europium ( eu ) is one of the few lanthanides that commonly exists in stable divalent and trivalent states .",
    "this behavior is unusual for most lanthanides , which almost exclusively form compounds with an oxidation state of + 3 . in the case of eu the + 2 state",
    "is stabilized by the fact that it corresponds to a half - filled @xmath4-shell .",
    "eu@xmath0 is a frequently used dopant in luminescent materials because of the dipole allowed optical transition from the lowest 4__f__@xmath55__d__@xmath6 excited state to the 4__f__@xmath75__d__@xmath8 ground state . in terms of its use as an activator for scintillators or x - ray phosphors",
    "the fact that eu can exist in both the eu@xmath0 and eu@xmath9 form makes the eu@xmath0 ion a good hole trap for the holes created by the incident gamma or x - ray .",
    "this is similar to ce which acts as a hole trap in the ce@xmath9 valence state since the ce@xmath10 form is also stable .",
    "the scintillation decay time of 400 - 1500ns for eu@xmath0 activated compounds limits their use for applications requiring ultrafast scintillation such as medical tomography .",
    "however , the decay time is fast enough to avoid deterious effects of signal pile up for many other application areas such as homeland security , non - proliferation etc .",
    "the recent `` rediscovery '' of sri@xmath2:eu as an extremely bright scintillator with energy resolution similar to that of labr@xmath11:ce has sparked interest in investigating eu doped compounds to be employed for radioisotope identification.@xcite more recently two new scintillators , ba@xmath2csi@xmath3:eu and babri : eu , with light yield comparable to sri@xmath2:eu have been discovered@xcite although babri : eu was previously known to be a bright x - ray phosphor.@xcite in particular , ba@xmath2csi@xmath3:eu is reported to be less hygroscopic than labr@xmath11 and sri@xmath2.@xcite furthermore , in a recent review@xcite dorenbos observes that significant improvements in scintillation light yield over sri@xmath2:eu may be possible for eu@xmath0 activated scintillators .",
    "first - principles calculations within the framework of density functional theory ( dft ) have previously been employed to study and search for new bright rare - earth doped inorganic scintillator materials.@xcite we have previously developed a systematic calculation procedure to study ce@xmath9 doped scintillator materials based on studies of about a hundred inorganic host compounds.@xcite our theoretical criteria are based on calculating the relative positions of ce 4__f _ _ and 5__d _ _ states with respect to host valence and conduction band edges , respectively .",
    "this approach has been validated for known ce scintillators , non - scintillators and new ce - doped candidate materials for bright scintillation have also been predicted.@xcite theoretically calculable parameters that we use to predict candidate materials for bright scintillation are    1 .   the size of the host material bandgap .",
    "the number of electron - hole pairs produced by the incident @xmath12-ray is inversely proportional to the host material bandgap .",
    "the energy difference between the valence band maximum ( vbm ) of the host and the eu 4__f _ _ level .",
    "the eu 4__f _ _ level must be above the vbm for scintillation .",
    "3 .   the level of localization of the lowest _ d _ character excited state determines if it is a host conduction band ( cb ) state or a eu 5__d _ _ character state .",
    "this is to determine if the excited eu 5__d _ _ state is in the gap of the host material .",
    "overall a necessary condition for luminescence and scintillation is that the eu 4__f _ _ and 5__d _ _ levels should lie in the gap of the host material and the eu 4__f__-vbm gap should not be too large or hole trapping on the eu site will be less favored .",
    "the excited eu 5__d _ _ level should not be too close to the cbm or thermal quenching will reduce the brightness at room temperature . trapping processes on",
    "the host associated with electron traps , hole traps or self - trapped excitons can also reduce or quench the brightness of a scintillator but they are beyond the scope of the present study .",
    "the present work is an extension of our calculation scheme for ce - doped systems to study eu luminescence for candidate scintillator materials and the reader should consult our previous paper @xcite for more details of the approach .",
    "we have previously reported preliminary theoretical results for ba@xmath2csi@xmath3:eu and bafi : eu.@xcite in this paper we report on more accurate calculations for those systems , using larger cell sizes , as well as new eu doped candidate materials .",
    "this theoretical approach can also be used to select candidate materials for eu@xmath0-activated phosphors for efficient lighting applications etc . noting that the necessary criterion for such applications is that the eu 4__f _ _ and 5__d _ _ levels should lie in the gap of the host material and the 5__d _ _",
    "should not be too close to the cbm to prevent thermal quenching .",
    "unlike scintillators , in phosphors used for lighting , the 4__f _ _ electron is directly excited , so the size of the bandgap and the proximity of the 4__f _ _ to the vbm are not directly related to a phosphor s performance for these types of applications .",
    "in order to simulate the effect of a single eu@xmath0 dopant in a host lattice we construct a large supercell by periodically repeating the unit cell of the host crystal and then replace one of the host divalent cations ( ba@xmath0 , sr@xmath0 or ca@xmath0 ) with eu@xmath0 .",
    "the initial atomic positions and symmetry information of the host crystal were taken from the inorganic crystal structure database ( icsd).@xcite atomic relaxation studies of the doped system were performed within the framework of density functional theory using the vasp code.@xcite spin - polarized calculations were performed with pbe@xcite and lda approximations to the exchange - correlation functional and using the frozen - core projector - augmented wavefunction ( paw ) method@xcite as implemented in the vasp code.@xcite the europium pseudopotential was chosen to include ( 5@xmath13,5@xmath14,6@xmath13,4__f__,5__d _ _ ) as valence electrons .",
    "the plane wave cutoff energy for the electronic wavefunctions was set to 500 ev .",
    "integration within the brillouin zone was performed on a @xmath15 centered grid of _ k_-points . the number of irreducible _",
    "k_-points was chosen to be 4 or 8 depending on the size and geometry of the supercell .",
    "the total energy convergence criterion was set to 10@xmath16  ev and the maximum component of force acting on any atom in the relaxed geometry was less than 0.01  ev@xmath17 .",
    "pbe+u@xcite calculations were performed using the rotationally invariant method of dudarev@xcite for an on - site + u correction to treat the eu 4__f _ _ electrons with a single parameter u@xmath18 .",
    "we tuned the empirical u@xmath19 parameter to give the best agreement with experimental data and related previous calculations for the ground state eu 4__f _ _ to host vbm gap as described in the next section .",
    "host bandgaps were calculated at the level of pbe , hse functionals and the gw@xcite approximation .",
    "commonly used density functionals such as pbe and lda are known to underestimate the bandgap of semiconductors and insulators . a hybrid functional approach combining a fraction of screened exchange with an explicit density functional",
    "has been shown to give eigenenergies which are generally in much better agreement with experiment ; especially for semiconductors.@xcite these hybrid functional eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are therefore superior starting points for quasi - particle corrections using the gw approximation .",
    "bandgaps calculated using an hse+g@xmath20w@xmath20 approach have been shown to be in good agreement with experiments.@xcite hse06@xcite calculations were performed using the default fraction ( @xmath21=0.25 ) of nonlocal fock exchange .",
    "subsequently , quasi - particle bandgaps were determined within the single - shot g@xmath20w@xmath20 approach .",
    "convergence of representative g@xmath20w@xmath20 calculations were checked with respect to the number of empty bands and energy cutoffs used in the gw calculation .",
    "eu@xmath0 in the ground state , has a half - filled 4__f__@xmath7 shell with all the spins aligned and in the excited state has the 4__f__@xmath55__d__@xmath6 structure with the six 4__f _ _ electrons spin aligned leaving one empty 4__f _ _ state .",
    "while for a very accurate modeling of the 4__f _ _ electrons and their interactions more advanced theories than pbe+u may be required we found that a + u correction for eu doped materials gives reasonable quantitative agreement between theory and experiment for 4__f _ _ electron energy levels .",
    "also our purpose in this paper is to provide a high throughput method for qualitative prediction of scintillator properties of new materials rather than perform costly more accurate calculations for a small number of systems . in order to set the correct ground state spin alignment of the 4__f _ _ electrons we set nupdown=7 in the vasp input file .",
    "typical values of u@xmath19 reported in the literature for bulk eu@xmath0 compounds are @xmath22 6ev.@xcite we found that setting u@xmath19= 6ev places the eu@xmath0 4__f _ _ level incorrectly with respect to the host valence band maximum . for example , pbe+u calculations of bai@xmath2:eu position the eu@xmath0 4__f _ _ level below the vbm ( figure 1 ) .",
    "this is inconsistent with the fact that bai@xmath2:eu is a known scintillator material and hence the eu 4__f _ _ states should lie above the host vbm.@xcite from our studies of ce@xmath9 doped compounds we found that the 4__f _ _ states of rare - earth dopants can have very atomic - like character as opposed to an itinerant nature which is possible in ce bulk compounds .",
    "therefore , the + u correction required for wide bandgap eu doped systems may be significantly different from bulk eu systems and we explored the possibility of determining u@xmath19 empirically based on our previous studies of ce - doped systems as well as experimentally measured 4__f__-vbm energy gaps for eu@xmath0 doped inorganic compounds .",
    "density of states calculated for bai@xmath2:eu with ( a ) u@xmath19= 2.2ev and ( b ) u@xmath19= 6ev .",
    "eu 4@xmath23 ( spin up ) states are clearly below the vbm for u@xmath19= 6ev .",
    "fermi level is set at 0ev . ]",
    "direct experimental measurement of the eu@xmath0 4__f__-vbm gap is available for a very few compounds such as caga@xmath2s@xmath24:eu.@xcite the energy level scheme of large bandgap compounds such as caf@xmath2 , srf@xmath2 and baf@xmath2 doped with eu@xmath0 is known from detailed experiments .",
    "caf@xmath2 , srf@xmath2 and baf@xmath2 have bandgaps of 12.1ev , 11.25ev and 11.0ev respectively,@xcite with estimates for the 4__f__-vbm energy gap at 7.9ev , 7.5ev and 7.0ev respectively.@xcite the emphasis in our search for new bright scintillator materials is not on such materials since a large band gap fundamentally limits the number of electron - hole ( e - h ) pairs generated by an incoming @xmath12-ray . also in the context of the bandgap error in lda calculations for these systems , since the 4__f _ _ level can lie above the midpoint of the bandgap , we may expect a large error in our 4__f__-vbm due to the bandgap error .",
    "therefore , fitting the + u parameter to these systems may yield different values from the lower bangap systems we are interested in where the eu@xmath0 4__f _ _ level is close to the vbm . for the lower bandgap systems we may expect the error in the 4__f",
    "_ _ level due to the bandgap error to be small and the self - interaction error to be dominant .",
    "we , therefore , only used the experimentally determined 4__f__-vbm gap ( = 1.75 ev@xcite ) for caga@xmath2s@xmath24:eu to fit the u@xmath19 parameter where the 4__f _ _ level is relatively close to the vbm .",
    "dorenbos has proposed an alternative empirical method to estimate the location of eu@xmath0 levels relative to the host valence and conduction band edge.@xcite the 4__f__-vbm gap is estimated based on the energy required for charge - transfer from the host vb to eu@xmath9 while the location of the lowest 5__d _ _ level requires an estimation of the host conduction band edge .",
    "this approach , as stated in the paper,@xcite can introduce systematic errors as large as 0.5ev and it depends on the measured eu absorption and emission wavelengths.@xcite therefore we did not use this data for fitting the u@xmath19 parameter .",
    "we estimate the 4__f__-vbm gap using the same u@xmath19 for eu 4__f _ _ electrons as determined for ce 4__f _ _ electrons in our earlier work.@xcite we verified that the character of the eu 4__f _ _ electrons is very similar to the ce 4__f _ _ electron and atomic - like in nature .",
    "table  [ tab : table1 ] summarizes these results for selected eu - activated luminescent materials .",
    "choosing u@xmath19=2.2ev gave very good agreement with experimental data for caga@xmath2s@xmath24:eu .",
    "this is similar to the u@xmath19 used for lower band gap and more covalent iodides and sulfides in our studies of ce - doped systems.@xcite we set u@xmath19 = 2.5ev for oxides and non - iodide halides as was found to give the best fit to experimental data for ce systems . since the 4__f _ _",
    "electrons are screened by the outer 5__s _ _ and 5__p _ _ electrons the character of the eu 4__f _ _ electrons remains very similar in different host compounds so we can use the u@xmath19 parameter thus determined to estimate the eu 4@xmath23-vbm energy gap in new candidate host compounds from first - principles .",
    "while the limited amount of experimental data for the 4__f _ _ level in eu doped systems does not allow us to directly confirm this from the experimental point of view we did find this to be the case for ce doped systems where experimental data for a range of different host materials with different 4__f _ _ levels",
    "is available.@xcite    [ cols=\"<,^,^,<,^,<,^ , < \" , ]     table  [ tab : table2 ] presents the results of host pbe bandgaps , ground state eu 4__f__-vbm gaps for the relaxed structure and localization percentage and ratio of the ( eu@xmath0 ) * excited state for a selection of scintillators and non - scintillators .",
    "the localization percentage in table  [ tab : table2 ] is the percentage of the normalized single electron density in a voronoi cell centered on the eu atom .",
    "the ratio in table  [ tab : table2 ] is the ratio of the localization percentage of a state on the eu site to its next largest localization percentage on a different cation .",
    "non - scintillators refers to compounds where eu@xmath0 luminescence has not been observed experimentally .",
    "we have performed calculations for about sixty different eu doped materials and present the best candidates for new bright scintillation , based on our calculated criteria , at the bottom of table  [ tab : table2 ] as well as ba@xmath2hfs@xmath24:eu and bao : eu which are predicted non - scintillators .",
    "we obtain good qualitative agreement for known scintillators and non - scintillators for the relation between our calculated parameters and their performance as scintillators .",
    "in particular , there is no localization of the excited states for non - scintillators while known bright scintillators such as sri@xmath2:eu and babri : eu have moderate bandgap , low 4@xmath23-vbm gap , and very localized 5__d _ _ character states centered on eu .",
    "convergence tests were carried out with respect to cell size for the systems in table  [ tab : table2 ] .",
    "the cell sizes quoted in table  [ tab : table2 ] were chosen to give the 4@xmath23 levels converged to less than 0.1ev and the localization data converged to within 10% .    amongst the non - scintillators , the lowest excited state",
    "has predominately @xmath25 character in bas , bao , srzro@xmath11 and ba@xmath2hfs@xmath24 corresponding primarily to ba 5@xmath25 , zr 4@xmath25 and hf 5@xmath25 character states .",
    "whereas in srga@xmath2o@xmath24 and ba@xmath2ga@xmath2s@xmath3 the excited state has strongly ga 4@xmath13 character .",
    "thus the presence of the second cation ( zr , hf or ga ) introduces a lower energy state which constitutes the cbm .",
    "the cbm state associated with the second cation is below the sr or ba @xmath25 character states as well as the first eu @xmath26 state . in all our studies for eu doped materials we found that",
    "if the cbm has no @xmath25 character then there is no eu emission .",
    "if the cbm is of @xmath13 or @xmath14 character then it seems to put in a relatively much lower cbm so that the eu 5@xmath25 states are always in the conduction band . therefore determining if the dominant character of the cbm of the host material is @xmath25 or not can possibly be used to determine if the doped material is a candidate phosphor or scintillator with eu doping .",
    "furthermore , we also find that even if the cbm is of @xmath25 character unless that @xmath25 character is associated with the dopant site atom for eu ( ca , sr and ba in our studies ) then the eu 5@xmath25 is in the conduction band and there is no emission .",
    "we also find that for many systems there is some level of hybridization between the ca , sr and ba 5d states and the other cation states forming the cbm .",
    "further studies would be required to see if these rules hold for all eu and ce doped phosphors .",
    "dorenbos @xcite distinguishes between two types of eu phosphor materials which he refers to as type i and type ii . for type",
    "i the cbm is formed by @xmath25 character states from the ca , sr or ba while for type ii the cbm has the character of one of the other cations in the host material .",
    "as mentioned above , in our studies we find there are many materials that fall between these two classifications in the sense that the cbm is formed by a hybridization of states from the different cations of the host material .",
    "overall though we find the bright scintillators have a cbm of predominantly ca , sr and ba @xmath25 character ( type i ) while the weaker scintillators and non - scintillators are closer to type ii systems , but there exist also non - scintillators of type i such as bao .",
    "bas crystallizes in the rocksalt @xmath27 structure similar to cas and srs both of which are known to exhibit eu@xmath0 activated luminescence .",
    "there are contradictory reports in the literature on eu@xmath0 emission in bas : eu with earlier data of kasano et al.@xcite quoting an emission wavelength at 572 nm . recently ,",
    "smet et al.@xcite observed a peak centered at 873 nm characterized as `` anomalous emission '' but no band at 572 nm in the emission spectra .",
    "they present an energy level scheme for bas : eu@xmath0 but state that placement of 5__d _ _ states is qualitative .",
    "let us try to estimate the 5@xmath25-cbm gap noting that the reported low temperature 4__f__@xmath285__d__(lowest ) absorption wavelength is 542nm.@xcite the theoretically calculated 4@xmath23-vbm gap in bas : eu is 1.63 ev .",
    "the bandgap of bas from the optical absorption spectrum is reported as 3.88ev@xcite and 3.9ev.@xcite subtracting the absorption energy and 4@xmath23-vbm energy from the bandgap gives the lowest 5__d _ _ state slightly above the cbm . on the other hand ,",
    "if we consider the bandgap of 3.49ev as quoted by smet et al.@xcite then the location of the 5@xmath25 level is @xmath290.5ev above the cbm , in very good agreement with their results .",
    "overall our results based on measuring localization of the excited ( eu@xmath0 ) * state are in agreement with recent experimental results for bas : eu.@xcite    similar to bas ,",
    "bao crystallizes in the rocksalt structure and based on negligible localization of the excited state on eu site we predict it to be a non - scintillator .",
    "we are not aware of any published data on absorption ( or emission ) wavelength for bao : eu and there is one publication where it was studied for potential scintillation applications however , the host was found to be excessively hygroscopic.@xcite it is instructive to note that mo and ms ( m= ba , sr , ca ) compounds , by dorenbos classification , are examples of type i systems where the band gap decreases much faster than eu emission ( and absorption ) energies.@xcite    alkaline earth halide and mixed halide compounds are some of the brightest known eu - activated scintillators and our calculations qualitatively agree with measured data in the literature for this class of systems .",
    "the barium systems bacl@xmath2 , babr@xmath2 , bai@xmath2 , baclbr and babri are isomorphous and occur in the orthorhombic pbcl@xmath2 structure .",
    "the bandgap and 4@xmath23-vbm gap increases as we go up the periodic table from diiodides to dichlorides .",
    "barium fluorohalides such as bafi occur in a tetragonal structure similar to matlockite ( pbfcl ) .",
    "bafi is not hygroscopic unlike other ba halides or mixed halides however , due to its layered structure it cleaves easily.@xcite bafi : eu , babrcl : eu and babri : eu are known x - ray phosphors with bafi : eu being the most commonly used x - ray storage phosphor . as can be seen from table ii all the alkaline halides have very localized excited eu 5d states below the cbm while the brightest ones ( babri , sri@xmath2 ) also have the lowest bandgaps and 4@xmath23-vbm gaps .",
    "bai@xmath2 has the lowest bandgap of all the alkaline earth halides in the table but is less bright than babri and sri@xmath2 .",
    "this may be due to trapping centers as suggested in some of the experimental studies of bai@xmath2.@xcite the alkaline earth diiodide cai@xmath2 is one of the brightest known scintillators and occurs in the hexagonal @xmath30 , structure which is different from the other diiodides like sri@xmath2 and bai@xmath2 which are orthorhombic .",
    "this in part explains why the calculated bandgap for cai@xmath2 is actually lower than for sri@xmath2 .",
    "from the theory we find it has a low 4@xmath23-vbm and a very localized excited eu 5@xmath25 state .",
    "the oxide based hosts listed in table  [ tab : table2 ] are characterized by higher bandgaps than the halides or sulphides , larger 4@xmath23-vb gaps and relatively good localization on the eu site although typically not as high as the bright halides .",
    "many of the oxide host materials such as the silicates are relatively easy to grow in crystal form and have higher thermal stability so even though no oxide based scintillator is known that has brightness comparable to the very bright halide scintillators such as sri@xmath2 there is continued interest in new oxides for phosphor as well as scintillator applications .",
