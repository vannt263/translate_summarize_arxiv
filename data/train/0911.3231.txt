    "the concept of dielectric permittivity in media with temporal dispersion is commonly used in electrodynamics and condensed matter physics ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . for not too strong fields",
    "the dielectric permittivity @xmath0 depending on the time - like variable @xmath1 is introduced from the linear integral relation between the electric field @xmath2 and the electric displacement @xmath3 .",
    "then the frequency - dependent permittivity @xmath4 is defined using the fourier transformations of the fields @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "below we argue that this procedure , which is wholly satisfactory for dielectric materials , faces additional regularization problems in an infinite medium containing free charge carriers .",
    "this leads us to the conclusion that some applications of the frequency - dependent dielectric permittivities allowing for free charge carriers might be not rigorously justified .",
    "as one such example we discuss the dielectric permittivity of the drude model which leads to widely discussed difficulties when substituted into the lifshitz formula for the van der waals and casimir force at nonzero temperature @xcite .",
    "for simplicity we consider an isotropic nonmagnetic medium of infinite extent .",
    "if its properties do not depend on time , the linear dependence between @xmath5 and @xmath6 satisfying causality ( here and below we omit the argument @xmath7 ) is given by @xmath8 the kernel @xmath9 of the integral operator on the right - hand side of ( [ eq1 ] ) is called the dielectric permittivity for media with temporal dispersion .",
    "we represent it in the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a continuous real - valued function and the delta function @xmath12 is defined on the interval @xmath13 in the following manner @xcite : @xmath14,{\\ \\ } -\\infty < t < t .",
    "\\end{array } \\right . \\label{eq2a}\\ ] ] here , @xmath15 is an arbitrary function which has bounded variation in the vicinity of the point @xmath16 .",
    "note that from physical point of view the function @xmath11 is defined only for @xmath17 ; for @xmath18 it can be ascribed any values ( including to vanish in that region ) .    substituting ( [ eq2 ] ) into ( [ eq1 ] ) with account of ( [ eq2a ] ) and introducing the new variable @xmath19 , we rearrange ( [ eq1 ] ) to @xcite @xmath20 representing the real functions @xmath5 and @xmath6 as fourier integrals ,",
    "@xmath21 one can rewrite ( [ eq3 ] ) in terms of fourier transforms of the fields @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath4 are complex - valued functions . from ( [ eq5 ] )",
    "it follows that @xmath4 is an analytic function in the upper half - plane of complex @xmath25 including the real axis with possible exception of the point @xmath26 . as a result ,",
    "the real and imaginary parts of @xmath4 are connected by means of the kramers - kronig relations @xcite .",
    "note that in contrast , for instance , to @xcite we always consider fields defined in @xmath27-space as real and only their fourier transforms might be complex .    the equivalence between ( [ eq3 ] ) and ( [ eq5 ] ) requires the existence of integrals ( [ eq4 ] ) ( and respective inverse fourier transformations ) and the possibility to change the order of integrations with respect to @xmath28 and @xmath29 . in mathematics",
    "there are many different conditions on how to assign a rigorous meaning to ( [ eq4 ] ) and respective inverse formulas .",
    "the most widely used demand is that the function @xmath5 should have a bounded variation and be integrable together with its modulus , i.e. , should belong to @xmath30 . in this case the function @xmath23 is also bounded , uniformly continuous on the axis @xmath31 and @xmath32 when @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath6 should possess the same properties .",
    "the change of order of integrations is possible if both integrals under consideration are uniformly convergent .",
    "it can be easily seen that the above conditions permitting to introduce the frequency - dependent dielectric permittivity @xmath4 in accordance with ( [ eq5 ] ) are not directly applicable for media with free charge carriers . as an example we consider the widely used dielectric permittivity of the drude model , describing such media @xcite",
    ", @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the plasma frequency and @xmath36 is the relaxation parameter .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath26 may lead to mathematical problems in fourier transformation . to make a link between @xmath37 and real - valued physical fields @xmath6 and @xmath5 , it would be of interest to determine the respective function @xmath38 .",
    "the substitution of ( [ eq6 ] ) into ( [ eq5 ] ) leads to the following equations @xmath39 from the first equation , by means of the inverse cosine fourier transformation performed with the help of the integral 3.723(2 ) in @xcite , one finds @xmath40 it is easily seen that the substitution of ( [ eq8 ] ) into the first equation of ( [ eq7 ] ) with account of 3.893(2 ) in @xcite leads to a correct identity , however , substituted into the second equation of ( [ eq7 ] ) fails . on the other hand ,",
    "using the inverse sine fourier transformation and the integral 3.725(1 ) in @xcite , the second equation of ( [ eq7 ] ) leads to a different result @xmath41 now , the substitution of ( [ eq9 ] ) into the right - hand sides of equations ( [ eq7 ] ) reproduces their left - hand sides up to additional undefined terms and thus also violates the equalities .",
    "the pathological properties under consideration are explained by the fact that @xmath37 results in @xmath23 which is unbounded in any vicinity of @xmath26 .",
    "this means that @xmath5 can not be represented as a fourier integral ( [ eq4 ] ) and both the definition of @xmath4 in ( [ eq5 ] ) and equivalent equations ( [ eq7 ] ) become unjustified .",
    "the question arises of whether there is a possibility to consistently define the function @xmath38 related to the frequency - dependent permittivity ( [ eq6 ] ) . keeping in mind that in the case of the drude model the second equality in ( [ eq5 ] ) can not be considered as a classical fourier transformation",
    ", we make an attempt to assign a definite meaning to the function @xmath38 by considering the generalized inverse transformation of the quantity @xmath42 defined as @xmath43 here , the addition of an infinitesimally small quantity @xmath44 establishes the rule on how to bypass the pole of @xmath45 at @xmath26 and the following notations are used @xmath46    in @xmath47 the integrated function is regular at @xmath26 .",
    "this integral can be found in 3.354(5 ) @xcite , @xmath48 the second integral in ( [ eq11 ] ) can be calculated using the contours consisting of the real axis in the complex @xmath25-plane and semicircles of infinitely large radii centered at the origin in the lower half - plane ( for @xmath49 ) and in the upper half - plane ( for @xmath50 ) .",
    "the result is @xmath51 where for @xmath49 the contributions from the two poles at @xmath52 and @xmath53 were taken into account whereas for @xmath50 only one pole at @xmath54 determines the value of @xmath55 . substituting ( [ eq12 ] ) and ( [ eq13 ] ) into the right - hand side of ( [ eq10 ] ) we arrive at @xmath56",
    "it is seen that the suggested rule leads to the same result ( [ eq9 ] ) , as was obtained by the inverse sine fourier transformation from the imaginary part of @xmath37 in ( [ eq7 ] ) .",
    "a similar situation occurs for other dielectric permittivities taking into account free charge carriers , e.g. , for the dielectric permittivities of the plasma model and of the normal skin effect , @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the dc conductivity . in both cases",
    "the mathematical conditions permitting to perform the fourier transformation in the classical understanding are violated . however , by using the same considerations as presented above in the case of the drude model , one may assign a meaning analogous to ( 10 ) to the second formula in ( [ eq5 ] ) and obtain the following dielectric permittivities as functions of @xmath1 : @xmath59 it should be remarked that @xmath60 is obtainable also from ( [ eq14 ] ) in the limiting case @xmath61 .",
    "now let us check for consistency the respective results for @xmath5 .",
    "for example , we choose the electric field in the form @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 describes the spatial dependence of the field .",
    "as already stated ( [ eq17 ] ) , the function @xmath6 satisfies all required conditions and can be presented as fourier integral .",
    "its fourier transform is calculated using the formula 3.896(4 ) in @xcite , @xmath65 substituting ( [ eq14 ] ) and ( [ eq17 ] ) into ( [ eq3 ] ) and using the formula 3.322(2 ) in @xcite we arrive at @xmath66 , \\label{eq19}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 is the error function and @xmath68 .",
    "keeping in mind that @xcite @xmath69 we obtain for @xmath70 @xmath71 this is what one expects on physical grounds because for an infinite medium containing free charge carriers the action of switching on and then switching off electric field should result in a nonzero residual displacement ( for a finite medium , the presence of external electric field leads to the accumulation of positive and negative charges on the opposite boundary surfaces and to the vanishing total electric field inside such a medium @xcite ; after the external electric field switches off , the accumulated charges are distributed uniformly over the volume of the medium leading to zero electric displacement at @xmath72 ) .",
    "however , the first equality in ( [ eq21 ] ) means that @xmath5 is not an integrable function over the interval @xmath31 .",
    "this makes impossible the use of the standard fourier transformation ( [ eq4 ] ) and resulting equality ( [ eq5 ] ) , and makes the whole formalism not self - consistent .",
    "this can be seen even more clearly if one defines @xmath23 in accordance with the first equality in ( [ eq5 ] ) , where @xmath73 and @xmath24 is given in ( [ eq18 ] ) , and then calculates the electric displacement using the first equality in ( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "the obtained quantity which we notate @xmath74 is calculated using the formulas 3.954(2 ) in @xcite and 2.5.36(6,11 ) in @xcite .",
    "the result is @xmath75 where @xmath76 is defined in ( [ eq19 ] ) .",
    "it has nonzero values at both @xmath77 and @xmath78 : @xmath79 derivation of a different electric displacement than in ( [ eq19 ] ) , which does not vanish at @xmath78 , i.e. , before the switching on of the electric field , can be understood as an artifact resulting from the use of the fourier integral of a nonintegrable function @xmath80 ( the definition of the fourier integral as a generalized function used in mathematics in this case seems to be not appropriate in our physical situation because it is natural to understand the electric displacement as a usual function ) .",
    "this suggests that in the presence of free charge carriers the standard definition of the frequency - dependent dielectric permittivity basing on the formal representation of @xmath81 and @xmath76 in terms of fourier integrals is not satisfactory and requires some additional regularization procedure .",
    "as an example of such procedure , we consider the modified dielectric permittivity of the drude model @xmath82 where , in contrast with ( [ eq10 ] ) , the quantity @xmath83 is not infinitesimally small . in accordance with ( [ eq23a ] )",
    "@xmath84 is regular at @xmath26 .",
    "the substitution of ( [ eq23a ] ) into ( [ eq5 ] ) leads to @xmath85 it can be easily seen that both the inverse cosine and sine fourier transformations performed in ( [ eq23b ] ) lead to the common result @xmath86 substituting this into ( [ eq3 ] ) and performing calculations with the electric field ( [ eq17 ] ) , we arrive at the modified electric displacement @xmath87 . \\label{eq24d}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the limiting case @xmath88 ( [ eq24d ] ) coincides with ( [ eq19 ] ) .",
    "precisely the same result , as in ( [ eq24d ] ) , is obtained if one considers @xmath89 and then finds @xmath90 from the first equality in ( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "thus , when we assume @xmath91 , both methods of the calculation of the electric displacement are in agreement .",
    "the reason is that for @xmath91 the functions @xmath5 and @xmath23 belong to @xmath30 and all fourier transformations are well defined .",
    "however , to obtain the correct physical results for an infinite medium , one must put @xmath92 in ( [ eq24d ] ) and return to ( [ eq19 ] ) .",
    "the point is that ( [ eq24d ] ) with @xmath91 leads to @xmath93 when @xmath70 [ as it must be for functions belonging to @xmath30 ] . at the same time , in the presence of free charge carriers , the electric displacement in an infinite medium remains nonzero in accordance with ( [ eq21 ] ) after the electric field is switched off .",
    "thus , the limiting transitions @xmath70 and @xmath88 are not interchangeable .",
    "the situation is quite different for dielectric materials at zero temperature which do not contain free charge carriers ( i.e. , for true insulators ) . in this case",
    "the dielectric permittivity can be represented in the form @xcite @xmath95 where @xmath96 are the oscillator frequencies , @xmath97 are the relaxation parameters , and @xmath98 are the oscillator strengths of @xmath99 oscillators . in this case",
    "the second equality of ( [ eq5 ] ) results in @xmath100 performing the inverse cosine fourier transformation in the first equation of ( [ eq25 ] ) with the help of the integrals 3.733(1,3 ) in @xcite we obtain @xmath101 precisely the same result is obtained by means of the inverse sine fourier transformation from the second equation in ( [ eq25 ] ) when one uses the integral 3.733(2 ) in @xcite . in this case",
    "all involved fourier integrals exist in the classical sense with no use of regularization and @xmath102 is well defined .",
    "substituting the electric field ( [ eq17 ] ) into ( [ eq3 ] ) and using the integral 3.897(1 ) in @xcite , we obtain the electric displacement in an insulating media , @xmath103\\right\\ } , \\label{eq27}\\ ] ] where @xmath104 the same result is obtained by means of the inverse fourier transformation from @xmath23 found using the first equality in ( [ eq5 ] ) , as it should be . from ( [ eq27 ] ) and ( [ eq20 ] )",
    "it can be easily seen that @xmath105 when @xmath70 , as it should be for insulating materials , and that both @xmath5 and @xmath23 belong to @xmath106 .",
    "to conclude , we have shown that the definition of the frequency - dependent dielectric permittivity for materials containing free charge carriers by means of fourier transformation of the fields is not as straightforward as in the case of insulators .",
    "the essence of the problem is in the use of the idealization of an infinite medium . for insulators",
    "this idealization is applicable if the sizes of the bodies are much greater than some characteristic parameter ( e.g. , the width of a gap between the bodies ) .",
    "however , for media with movable free charge carriers such kind of conditions fail .",
    "the physical situation for an infinite medium turns out to be totally different from the case of finite bodies of any conceivable size .",
    "in fact for conductors @xmath4 is a quantity obtained through formal application of fourier transformation in the region where it needs additional regularization . in spite of a great number of successful applications ( see , e.g. , @xcite )",
    "there are delicate cases where such procedure leads to problems . as an example one could mention the use of @xmath42 as a response function in the fluctuation - dissipation theorem and related puzzles in the theory of thermal casimir force @xcite . during the last ten years the thermal casimir force was the subject of considerable discussion .",
    "it was suggested @xcite to describe it using the lifshitz theory combined with the drude model ( [ eq6 ] ) . in the limit of large separations between the test bodies",
    "the predictions of the drude model approach were found to be in agreement with classical statistical physics @xcite . on the other hand , at short separations the predictions of this approach were excluded experimentally , whereas the predictions based on the use of the plasma model in ( [ eq15 ] ) were found to be consistent with the data @xcite .",
    "the question on how to correctly calculate the thermal casimir force still remains to be answered .",
    "keeping in mind that the lifshitz theory is based on the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , we would like to emphasize that the application of this theorem with poorly defined response functions can not be considered as either exact or rigorous and might cause currently discussed problems .",
