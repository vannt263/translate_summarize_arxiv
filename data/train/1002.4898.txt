    "to estimate the mass - loss rates of the new hh jets in carina , we first estimate electron densities from the intensity measured in images . the h@xmath0 emission measure in an ionized nebulosity depends on the electron density , @xmath12 as well as the emitting path length @xmath13 through the object . for a collimated jet ,",
    "we take @xmath13 to be the diameter of the jet body , or @xmath14 .",
    "table  4 lists estimates for @xmath13 for each hh jet and jet candidate taken from spatially resolved jet structures in our acs images . an expression between @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and the emission measure",
    "can be simplified to    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the h@xmath0 intensity measured in our narrowband f658n acs images in units of 10@xmath17 ergs s@xmath6 @xmath18 arcsec@xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the emitting path length through the jet in pc ( see smith et al .",
    "2004c ; bally et al .",
    "2006 ; walawender et al .",
    "table 4 lists measured values of @xmath16 and the corresponding estimates of @xmath12 calculated in this way .",
    "obviously there is wide variation in both @xmath16 and @xmath12 at different positions in each jet .",
    "the values of @xmath16 are therefore typical average values of bright emission features in the jet flow taken to be representative of the inner jet",
    ". we account for variations in @xmath16 along the jet ( sharp drops in intensity in figure  [ fig : trace901 ] , for example ) with a geometric filling factor @xmath21 , as noted below , since the observed density that causes the observed emission measure does not uniformly fill the column of the jet .    to provide rough estimates of the mass - loss rates for the carina hh jets from the electron densities in table 4 , we treat the jets as approximately cylindrical .",
    "therefore , the portions of the jets where we have chosen to measure representative values of @xmath13 , @xmath16 , and @xmath21 correspond to inner parts of the jet that are well collimated , such as hh  666  m and the inner parts of hh  900 , 901 , and 902 discussed in the previous section .",
    "even so , clumping at internal shocks begins to affect the emissivity , so to account for this effect ( bright knots separated by empty relatively spaces ) we adopt a geometric filling factor @xmath21 , estimated from the morphology in images .",
    "note that for hh  666  m , where we measure @xmath22 separately for a bright knot and a fainter region between knots , the derived mass - loss rate differs by only @xmath320% . for hh objects like hh  1003c , 1008 , 1009 , hhc-4 , etc .",
    ", where clear bow shocks but no clear collimated jet can be seen , we can not provide estimates of @xmath22 in this way , although we do give estimates of @xmath12 .",
    "adopting cylindrical structure for the collimated jets that we can measure , then , the average mass - loss rate flowing through _ one side _ of the jet is given by    @xmath23    where @xmath24=1.35 is the mean molecular weight , @xmath25 is the proton mass , @xmath26 is the jet speed , and @xmath21 is a geometric filling factor inferred from structure in images . to represent the total mass carried away by both sides of a bipolar jet , this number must be multiplied by 2 .",
    "numerically , this can then be expressed as    @xmath27    where @xmath11 is the jet speed in units of 200 km s@xmath6 .",
    "this expression is used to calculate the values of @xmath22 in table 4 , which also lists adopted values of @xmath11 and @xmath21 . using only a single - epoch of images and no kinematic information ,",
    "we can make only rough estimates of the characteristic mass - loss rates for the carina jets .",
    "better estimates will come from future studies that can provide proper motions with multi - epoch images and doppler shifts from high resolution spectra . for now , we adopt @xmath11 = 1.0 as a fiducial value for all . in hh  666 , spectra show speeds of roughly 200 km s@xmath6 for hh  666  m and o ( smith et al.2004c ) , and this is a typical speed for the inner parts of hh jets .",
    "also , we will be comparing these jet mass - loss rates to those derived in the same way for jets in the orion nebula , for which bally et al.(2006 ) adopted 200 km s@xmath6 for the speed of most jets .     listed in table 6 of bally et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , but multiplied by 2 to account for contributions from both sides of a bipolar jet , as we have done for table 4 ( see text ) .",
    "these orion mass - loss rates were derived using the same method we adopted for carina.,width=249 ]    there are , of course , considerable uncertainties in the estimates of @xmath22 in table  4 .",
    "as noted above , the denser jets have an unknown neutral h fraction , the filling factor @xmath21 that we adopt is rather subjective , and the jet speed is not known for all sources except hh  666 . although the choice of filling factor is subjective , it is guided by the jet structure in high resolution images , and is likely to be reliable to within @xmath2830% .",
    "judging from a wide array of observations of hh jets , the adopted velocity of 200 km s@xmath6 is a representative choice , introducing a factor of @xmath32 uncertainty . fortunately , more accurate estimates of the jet speed and possibly also the ionization fraction can be obtained with more detailed spectroscopic followup and a later epoch of _ hst _ imaging to measure proper motions of the jets ( these observations are needed to confirm the candidate jet objects anyway ) .",
    "the estimates of @xmath22 are probably good to within a factor of 23 or perhaps somewhat more , and are adequate to convey the rough distribution of jet mass - loss rates that we are sensitive to .",
    "this level of accuracy is comparable to expected intrinsic variability of the mass - loss rate over time for an individual jet anyway .",
    "for the one case where detailed spectroscopic observations are available , hh666 , it is reassuring that the electron density derived from the emission measure in image data ( table 4 ) agrees with the electron density derived from spectral diagnotstics like the [ s  ii ] doublet intensity ratio ( smith et al .",
    "2004c ) .",
    "while the electron density is subject to uncertain estimates of @xmath13 , we note that there is not much variation in derived values of @xmath12 in table 4 , which vary by less than a factor of 10 ( 200 to 2000 @xmath29 ) .",
    "in general , the fainter jets have @xmath12 of a few 10@xmath30 @xmath29 , while the brightest jets have densities around or slightly above 10@xmath31 @xmath29 .",
    "the faint end is likely a selection effect , in the sense that lower @xmath22 jets with densities near or below 10@xmath30 @xmath29 would have emission measures fainter than fluctuations in the background h  ii region and would be difficult to detect .",
    "jets with densities much above 2000 @xmath29 might have dense jet cores that remain largely neutral , despite the strong uv radiation , so that h@xmath0 emission does not necessarily trace the jet mass ( e.g. , hartigan et al .  1994 ) .",
    "this is another reason to suspect that for the densest jets , then , it is likely that the mass - loss rates and densities in table 4 are underestimates .",
    "we measure a range of mass - loss rates ranging from 8@xmath110@xmath2 @xmath5 yr@xmath6 up to @xmath310@xmath4 @xmath5 yr@xmath6 .",
    "these jet mass - loss rates trace a range of active accretion rates onto their driving protostellar sources . if one assumes that the mass - loss rate of the jet is roughly 10% of the accretion rate onto the star ( e.g. , calvet 1997 ) , the observed jet mass - loss rates in carina imply relatively high mass accretion rates of 10@xmath32 to 10@xmath33 @xmath5 yr@xmath6 .",
    "( if the visible hh jet is only some fraction of the wind driven from the protostellar disk , then implied accretion rates are even higher . )",
    "these are on the high end for the distribution of mass accretion rates measured for nearby sources ( e.g. , calvet et al .",
    "2000 ) , so the high mass - loss rate jets in our sample may trace more massive protostars or brief episodic accretion / outflow events akin to fu ori outbursts . indeed ,",
    "mass accretion rates around 10@xmath33 m@xmath34 yr@xmath6 are comparable to the episodic bursts of accretion inferred to occur in early protostellar phases ( calvet et al .",
    "jets in our sample with more typical mass - loss rates around 10@xmath32 @xmath5 yr@xmath6 are comparable to those of famous nearby hh jets like hh  34 , 47 , and 111 ( e.g. , hartigan et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : mdot ] illustrates a consequence of selection effects determining the lower jet densities that we are sensitive to .",
    "this is a histogram of the mass - loss rates for carina hh jets in table 4 ( black hatched ) compared to a similarly sized sample of hh jets in orion ( bally et al .",
    "bally et al .",
    "list several values for @xmath22 for each jet in their table  6 that are derived with different assumptions ; the values that we have plotted in figure  [ fig : mdot ] correspond to @xmath35 in their table 6 ( multiplied by a factor of 2 to account for both sides of a bipolar jet , to be consistent with our estimates in table 4 ) .",
    "these values were derived using the same method adopted here ( i.e. , eqn .",
    "2 ) , and therefore provide a useful comparison , subject to the same uncertainties and potential systematic effects . the sample discussed by bally et al .  ( 2006 ) was studied with a similar _ hst_/acs survey in the f658n filter .",
    "it is also worth noting that this sample of orion jets represents those found in the _",
    "outer _ parts of the orion nebula , not in the brightest inner region near the trapezium .",
    "the contrast between jets and the background nebula is therefore comparable to carina .",
    "the main lesson from figure  [ fig : mdot ] is that in carina we are likely missing a large number of hh jets at the lower end of the @xmath22 distribution , even with _ hst _",
    ", if this distribution is similar to that in orion .",
    "both show a similar slope in the jet mass - loss function , with very roughly @xmath36 . the @xmath22 distribution for carina hh jets peaks at @xmath310@xmath37 @xmath5 yr@xmath6 , whereas that in orion seems to peak at lower values around 10@xmath38 @xmath5 yr@xmath6 .",
    "orion is 5 times closer to us than carina , so with the same _ hst _ camera , it is easier to detected fainter , thinner shock filaments and narrower jets that have lower mass - loss rates .",
    "the thin filaments of these weaker hh jets may be lost in the bright nebular background with the lower physical spatial resolution achieved in carina .",
    "if the @xmath22 distribution in orion is representative of the intrinsic distribution in carina , then it is likely that the hh jets we have detected in carina are roughly half ( or less ) of the total number of protostellar outflows in the region we surveyed .",
    "our acs h@xmath0 survey did not uniformly cover the entire carina nebula , however , and is not an unbiased sample with any strict completeness criteria ( see figure  [ fig : map ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , it seems likely that we are missing a large number of weaker jets . extrapolating from the 39 jets we detected with hst , correcting for both a factor of @xmath32 because of undetected jets at the low end of the @xmath22 range plus the fact that we only surveyed a portion of the nebula with _ hst _ , it is likely that carina currently harbors at least 150200 active protostellar jets .",
    "a key qualitative result of this study is that the _ hst _ images of carina reveal several cases where hh jets emerge from tiny cometary clouds ( roughly 0.01@xmath390.05 pc in size ) .",
    "the most striking example was hh  900 , but several other examples are seen as well , like hh  901 , 1006 , 1011 , 1013 , hhc-1 , and hhc-3 .",
    "the presence of a collimated hh jet emerging from such a globule requires that the globule harbor an actively accreting protostar , so it proves that even the smallest clouds  which appear to be only shredded remnants of a larger molecular cloud  are , in fact , important sites of ongoing active star formation in an evolving h  ii region like carina . since the phase during which an active hh outflow may be detected is quite short ( a few 10@xmath40 yr ) compared to the expected evaporation time of the cloud ( @xmath4110@xmath42 yr ) , and because we are biased toward detecting the most powerful outflows ( see above ) , it is possible that more of these small clouds also harbor young stars .",
    "interestingly , the clouds from which the jets emerge are small enough and isolated enough that they may be formation sites of a _ single _ star or binary system .",
    "this makes them valuable objects for case studies in star formation because their isolated nature simplifies the complexities normally encountered in crowded massive star - forming regions .",
    "there is another reason that these objects may be of particular interest , having to do with the looming deaths of several nearby massive stars and possible connections to our own solar system .",
    "as discussed above for the case of hh  900 , these globules are destined to intercept the sn ejecta that will soon result from the deaths of @xmath43 car and several other massive stars that are only a few parsecs away .",
    "this can lead to efficient injection of radioactive nuclides into the tiny clouds , as is thought to have occurred in our own solar system , making these objects possible analogs of the conditions that formed the sun . in the specific case of hh  900",
    ", we showed in  3.2.2 that the cross - sectional size of its cloud would intercept a fraction of the sn ejecta from a hypothetical @xmath43 carinae sn that would be commensurate with the amount of sn ejecta thought to be injected into the cloud from which the solar system formed . that estimate was for only a single sn , but carina harbors @xmath370 o stars ( smith 2006a ) , a few dozen of which are likely to explode in the next 12 myr .",
    "these _ multiple _ sne can greatly enhance the amount of young sn ejecta that will be imparted to these clouds . without a second generation of stars forming at the periphery of a giant h  ii region , as seen in carina , it would be difficult to recreate the conditions necessary for the birth of the solar system .",
    "the proto - solar cloud must have been fairly close to a sn and the cloud itself must have cast a fairly wide net in order to intercept enough fresh sn ejecta .",
    "orion has also been discussed as a possible analog of the conditions under which the solar system formed , where young low - mass stars are seen in close proximity to an o - type star .",
    "however , remember that although one sees young protoplanetary disks very close to an o - type star that will _ eventually _ explode as a sn , that o star in orion ( @xmath44c ori ) is still very young and not ready to explode yet . by the time it evolves off the main sequence and ends its life 5 - 6 myr from now , the trapezium will likely have dissolved and the proplyds we see now will have long since had their disks evaporated . in carina , on the other hand , several of the most massive stars are already 3 myr old and appear poised to explode in short order  @xmath43  car , in particular , is thought to be near its end .",
    "furthermore , the region will not witness just one sn from @xmath43 car , but rather , in the next 1 - 2 myr there will be a rapid succession of a few dozen sne , several of them from some of the most massive stars known .",
    "this key difference makes a massive evolving h  ii region like carina seem like the most promising analog for the cradle of the solar system .",
    "are not always straight . hh jets with a gentle s - shape bend can result from precession of the axis of the driving source ( e.g. , devine et al .",
    "1997 ) , whereas cases in which both opposing flows in a bipolar jet bend in the same direction require an external agent .",
    "these types of bent jets , reviewed recently by bally et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , are interesting as they provide a potential diagnostic of bulk flows of plasma in the surrounding environment . in other words , they serve as `` wind socks '' in h  ii regions .",
    "they have been compared to the head - tail systems of jets from radio galaxies .",
    "several types of externally bent jets ( as opposed to precessing jets ) have been discussed .",
    "some collimated jets show a clear bend _ toward _ the center of star formation activity with increasing separation from the jet source , such as hh  499 and other jets in ngc  1333 ( bally & reipurth 2001 ) . in these cases the jet bend results because the young star that drives it is moving through a stationary ambient medium , as might occur if young star is dynamically ejected from the active star - forming cluster ( bally & reipurth 2001 ) .    in regions where young massive stars are present near a jet , such as in the orion nebula ,",
    "jets tend to bend _ away _ from the massive o - type stars . in these cases ,",
    "the bending may be caused by the influence of winds or uv radiation from the massive stars .",
    "this can occur by several mechanisms ( see bally et al .",
    "2006 ) , including the direct ram pressure of a side wind ( stellar winds or a bulk flow of plasma in the h  ii region cavity ) , radiation pressure acting on dust grains entrained by the jet , or the rocket effect if neutral gas in the jet becomes ionized by uv radiation .",
    "all of these forces act to push the jet flow away from the massive stars that provide winds and radiation .",
    "manifestations of this type of jet bending include the class of ll  ori objects ( bally et al .",
    "2001 ) , as well as smoothly curved bipolar jets like hh  502 ( bally et al .  2006 ) and hh  555 ( bally & reipurth 2003 ) .    a protostellar jet expanding away from its driving source may also bend suddenly if the jet has a grazing collision with a nearby cloud or other obstacle ( another jet , another star s disk , etc . ) . in this collision",
    ", the jet may be deflected in a different direction ( e.g. , raga & cant 1996 ; gouveia dal pino 1999 ) .",
    "examples of this phenomenon include the hh  110/270 combination ( rodriguez et al .",
    "1998 ; reipurth & olberg 1991 ) and the hh  83/84 complex ( reipurth et al.1997a ) .    among",
    "the 39 known hh jets and jet candidates in carina , we detect an interesting variety of jet bends .",
    "we discuss these in the context of three different types of jet bending , illustrated schematically in figure  [ fig : bend ] , numbered according to the three cases discussed below :    \\1 .",
    "first , our _ hst _ images reveal several examples of jets that bend _ away _ from nearby o - type stars , as expected in a region with rather harsh environmental conditions driven by the @xmath370 o - type stars in carina ( smith 2006a ) .",
    "this is the same as the case discussed above , exemplified by jets and ll  ori objects in orion ( bally et al.2006 ) .",
    "see bally et al .",
    "( 2006 ) for quantitative estimates of the forces that bend such jets",
    ". examples of this phenomenon in carina include hh  901 , 903 , 1004 , 1012 , 1017 , hhc-3 , hhc-5 , and hhc-8 .",
    "two of these , hh  1012 and hhc-8 , appear to be true ll  ori objects .",
    "this class of bent jets tends to be found closer to o stars , being more directly impacted by stellar winds and radiation .",
    "counter to expectations , several jets exhibit _ no perceptable bend of their jet axis _ , or very weak bends .",
    "these jets are surprisingly straight , considering the harsh environment in which they reside .",
    "a good example discussed previously is hh  666 ( smith et al.2004c ) , which maintains a very straight jet axis as each of its bipolar flows moves more than a parsec from the point where the jet was launched .",
    "other clear examples of straight bipolar jets among the new sample of jets and jet candidates in carina are hh  902 and 1010 .",
    "hh  902 does show some material that appears to be swept back in between clumps , but dense knots in the jet maintain a straight trajectory .",
    "these jets emerge from the heads of large dust pillars that have clearly been shaped by feedback from massive stars , so the straight axis is somewhat surprising .",
    "one possible explanation for the lack of any perceptible bend in the jets has to do with the immediate environment into which they are expanding once they exit the obscured part of the natal dust pillar .",
    "namely , the bright - rimmed dust pillars are clearly irradiated by a strong uv flux , and probably have dense photoevaporative flows from their surfaces ( depicted by short arrows in figure  [ fig : bend ] )",
    ". these dense photoevaporative flows from the head of a curved dust pillar will be radially divergent , so they will flow in essentially the same direction as any hh jet emerging from the pillar ( i.e. normal to the surface of the pillar ) .",
    "several dust pillars , such as the one associated with hh  666 , show clear empirical evidence for dense flows in the form of streaks and striations proceeding radially from the irregular surface of the cloud .",
    "these flows will therefore exert no side force on the jet to divert its trajectory , and these dense photoevaporative flows may even _ shield _ the hh jet from the sideward ram pressure of a bulk flow of plasma in the larger wind - blown bubble .",
    "around some pillar heads , one can see evidence for a stand - off shock between the photoevaporative flow and winds .",
    "intermediate cases are also possible , as in hh  903 , where the bulk flow of h  ii region plasma is in the process of crossing the pillar .",
    "lastly , we also see jets that ",
    "counter - intuitively  bend _ toward _ nearby massive stars .",
    "the best example of this , discussed earlier , is hh  900 .",
    "this behavior is somewhat perplexing , because it is probably not attributable to dynamical ejection from that cluster as in the case of bent jets in ngc  1333 ( bally & reipurth 2001 ) .",
    "( in the case of hh  900 , the cloud and its star would need to have been ejected from tr  16 , but the cluster is much older than the young cometary cloud , and the tail of hh  900 points away from tr  16 . ) the explanation for this type of jet bend may be similar to the previous case  i.e.  the influence of strong photoevaporative flows from the surfaces of molecular clouds . in this case , however , the dominant photoevaporative flow is not from the curved surface of the pillar or cloud from which the jet emerges , but from a neighboring cloud surface , as depicted for case 3 in figure  [ fig : bend ] .",
    "hh  900 is located very close to the edge of a dark molecular cloud , which shows a very bright pdr at ir wavelengths , as we noted in  3.2.2 .",
    "if hh  900 is embedded within this photoevaporative flow , the bulk flow could create the effective condition of a `` tail wind '' in its environment , so that the ram pressure pushes its bipolar jet toward the massive stars .",
    "while photoionizing radiation from o stars in tr  16 has probably led to the initial sculpting of the cometary cloud and its tail that points away from the massive stars , this tail wind may also be the agent responsible for producing the unusual zig - zags in the thin tail of hh  900 s parent globule ( figure  [ fig : hh900 ] ) by acting to compress it from the opposite direction .",
    "most of the hh jets in carina emerge from elongated cometary clouds or dust pillars , and some of the most striking examples are bipolar jets whose axis is nearly perpendicular to the elongated dust pillar .",
    "one may naturally wonder if there is any correlation between the jet axis orientation and the orientation of the underlying cloud ( and hence , the direction toward the massive stars whose radiation has shaped it ) .",
    "in fact , as this paper was nearing completion , lora , raga , & esquivel ( 2009 ) proposed that just such a preferential alignment should exist .",
    "this was based on 3d simulations of the interaction between an advancing ionization front and a neutral cloud , wherein compressed clumps of gas that form at the unstable interface tend to collapse and have angular momentum vectors perpendicular to the direction of the radiation flow .",
    "the clouds themselves tend to be elongated in the same direction as the radiation flow , forming structures akin to cometary clouds and dust pillars .",
    "if cores in these clumps collapse to form protostars and accretion disks , lora et al .",
    "( 2009 ) infer that the resulting hh jets will have a preferential orientation perpendicular to the long axis of their cometary cloud or dust pillar .",
    "we can test this hypothesis with the large number of jets discovered in a single region like carina , many of which emerge from dust pillars or cometary clouds that betray their dominant direction of incident radiation .",
    "if true , the angle between the jet axis and the long axis of a dust pillar or cometary cloud should favor orientations near 90 .",
    "figure  [ fig : orient ] shows a histogram of this projected angle measured in _",
    "hst _ images .",
    "this includes all hh jets and jet candidates for which an approximate cloud axis and jet axis could be measured ( i.e. this does not include hh jets like those in ngc  3324 , which emerge from a relatively straight ionization front , nor does it include hh objects like hh  1009 or hhc-4 , 7 , and 9 that lack clear collimated jets ; obviously hh  1017 and 1018 are not included because they have no associated dust pillar ) .",
    "we conclude from figure  [ fig : orient ] that in this sample , we detect no obvious correlation between the projected angles",
    ". there does not appear to be a preferred physical orientation between the jets and their parent clouds , at least not that we can detect .",
    "two caveats are that the hypothesis of lora et al .",
    "( 2009 ) requires that the formation of the protostars driving the jets was triggered by the advancing ionization front .",
    "we do not know what fraction of the jet sources in carina formed on their own and which ones were triggered .",
    "furthermore , the physical angle between the jet axis and its dust pillar is not necessarily the same as the angle projected on the sky .",
    "even jets perpendicular to their dust pillars can be oriented in such a way that the angle between them projected on the sky is not 90 .",
    "one must either select jets known to have their dust pillar axis near the plane of the sky , or one must study the statistical distribution of angles for random projections .    in any case",
    ", we find no evidence that selection effects like the jet direction will bias the sample of jets detected in our images .",
    "one might imagine , for example , that jets emerging perpendicular to the axis of a cometary cloud would be easier to detect than those more closely aligned to its axis , but this is apparently not the case ( e.g. , hh  1006 ) , so we consider it unlikely that we are missing a large number of jets whose axis is aligned with the cloud",
    ".      externally irradiated jets and outflows appear to be common in young h  ii regions .",
    "the orion nebula contains dozens of examples ranging from tiny , low mass - loss - rate jets visible only on high - angular resolution images such as those delivered by _",
    "hst _ ( bally et al .  2006 ) to giant outflow lobes such as the parsec - scale hh  400 ( bally et al .",
    "the carina nebula also contains a growing collection of such jets and outflows ( smith , bally , & brooks 2004c ; this work ) .",
    "however , the total momentum and energy injected by these outflows is unimportant in the global momentum and energy budget of the h  ii region .",
    "as in the orion nebula , momentum injection is dominated by the uv radiation field and stellar winds of the massive stars .",
    "the mass injection rate of the carina outflows ranges from less than @xmath45 @xmath5  yr@xmath6 to over @xmath46 @xmath5  yr@xmath6 per outflow . while the velocities for most outflows have not been determined by either spectroscopy or proper motions , typical values for such flows range from under 100 km  s@xmath6 to over 400 km  s@xmath6 .",
    "radial velocity measurements for hh  666 indicate a range of velocities up to 250 km  s@xmath6 ( smith et al .",
    "2004c ) . using a relatively large value for protostellar outflows of @xmath47 @xmath5  yr@xmath6 and a flow velocity of 200 km  s@xmath6 , and assuming that at any typical time there are 100 active outflows in the region , the total rate of momentum injection into the nebula would be about @xmath48 @xmath5  km  s@xmath19 .",
    "this is probably generaous since this estimate used the outflow parameters near the maximum values observed , and assumes that only about 20% of the true number of flows have been detected .",
    "the two dominant sources of internal motions in the nebula are likely to be the ionized photoevaporative / photoablation flows from dense cloud fragments trapped in the nebular interior and the impacts of massive - star winds .",
    "the average lyman continuum luminosity of the carina nebula is about @xmath49 ionizing photons per second ( smith 2006a ; smith & brooks 2007 ) ; it may have been a bit higher while the three current wnh stars and @xmath43 car were main - sequence stars ( see smith 2006a ) .",
    "the total value of @xmath50 may have decreased by as much as 30% in recent times as three massive stars evolved into their wnh phase and @xmath43  car became an lbv with a cooler atmosphere / wind .",
    "the dusty homunculus generated by the great eruption in the 1840s absorbs the uv luminosity of both this massive star and its companion , lowering the lyman continuum luminosity by as much as 20% since the 1840s .",
    "photoablation - generated momentum injection into the carina nebula is determined by the incident flux of ionizing euv ( @xmath51 912  ) radiation .",
    "dense spherical clouds lose mass to euv photo - abaltion at a rate    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is a factor of order unity that accounts for the illumination geometry ( @xmath54 1 for a sphere illuminated from only 1 direction ; @xmath53=4 for isotropic illumination from all directions ) , @xmath55 1.35 is the mean molecular weight , @xmath25 is the mass of hydrogen , @xmath56 cm@xmath31  s@xmath6 is the case - b recombination coeffficient for hydrogen at @xmath58  k , @xmath59 is the distance from the ionizing source with lyman continuum luminosity @xmath50 , and @xmath60 10 to 20 km  s@xmath6 is the velocity of the photoablation flow .",
    "the electron density in the limit of a high - density spherical neutral condensation of radius @xmath61 is given by    @xmath62    assuming that there are about 100 dense globules and pillars photoablating in the nebular interior , that their typical radii are about @xmath61=0.2  pc , and that they are located at an average distance of @xmath59=3  pc from the nearest ionizing sources , dense gas injects plasma at a rate of order @xmath22 = 0.02 @xmath5  yr@xmath6 .",
    "assuming that these flows have a velocity given by the sound speed in the plasma implies a momentum injection rate @xmath63 0.25 m@xmath34  km  s@xmath19 , two orders of magnitude larger than the injection rate by protostellar outflows .",
    "considering the growth of the @xmath64 @xmath5 h   ii region over the course of @xmath65 3  myr by ionization of the surrounding molecular cloud complex implies @xmath66 0.3 @xmath5  yr@xmath6 and @xmath63 1.2 @xmath5  km  s@xmath19 .",
    "this is at least three orders of magnitude larger than the injection rate by protostellar outflows .",
    "the force does not scale with @xmath22 due to the different geometry .    finally , using a total stellar - wind mass injection rate of @xmath67 @xmath5  yr@xmath6 ( smith & brooks 2007 ; smith 2006a ) at a typical velocity @xmath68 = @xmath69 km  s@xmath6 for an o - type star , implies a momentum injection rate @xmath70  km  s@xmath19 , comparable to the injection rate by photoablating clumps .",
    "the observed protostellar outflow sources inject momentum at a rate less than @xmath71 times the rate of combined injection rate from photoablation and massive star winds .",
    "they are therefore globally unimportant , even if our survey has left a large number of smaller jets undetected .",
    "numerical studies suggest that hh jets can be significant in the global turbulence of a cloud ( e.g. , wang et al .",
    "2009 ) , but our study indicates that this can only apply up to the time when massive stars are born , at which point hh jets become globally negligible",
    ". they may still be important locally , within clouds in outer parts of the nebula that are shielded behind ionization fronts .    while hh jets do not contribute significantly to the energy and momentum budget of the region",
    ", they do have a role to play .",
    "the presence of outflows in carina provides important corroborating evidence for ongoing star formation in the dense clouds in and surrounding the nebula .",
    "they provide important diagnostics of physical conditions and nebular flows .",
    "they are the `` wind socks '' that serve to trace the motions of plasma , and the forces that act on various plasma components . the direction and amount of bending probes the forces acting on the jet beams and outflow lobes .",
    "furthermore , the structure and properties of the jets and their source globules may provide diagnostics of the recent radiation history of the carina nebula .",
    "this topic will be addressed in a future paper .",
    "based on a narrow - band h@xmath0 imaging survey of the carina nebula with _ hst_/acs , we have reported the discovery of 38 new hh jets and candidate jets . including the one jet that was previously discovered in ground - based data , hh  666 ( smith et al .",
    "2004c ) , there are 22 hh jets and 17 candidate hh objects .",
    "we described each jet and its respective environment in detail . with assumed outflow speeds",
    ", we use the imaging data to derive the distribution of mass - loss rates for this sample if jets .",
    "a comparison with a similar distribution in orion , where narrow shock filaments can be resolved more easily , shows that our survey is insensitive to jets with mass - loss rates below 10@xmath7 @xmath5 yr@xmath6 .",
    "we must have missed several other jets , since this was a targeted study that did not cover the nebula uniformly .",
    "conservatively , there may be 150200 active protostellar jets in carina .",
    "this large number of jets signifies active outflow activity in carina , and the short lifetime of these outflows suggests that there is a large population of accreting young protostars and ysos in the region .",
    "we expect future ir studies to detect the driving sources of these hh jets , plus numerous other embedded ysos from which hh jets are not seen .",
    "ysos that are embedded within small dark clouds in the south pillars offer a likely analog to the cradle of the solar system , based on their proximity to a large number of very massive stars that will explode in the near future , polluting these clouds with radioactive nuclides like the @xmath9fe seen in solar system chondrites .",
    "while we detected a few objects that are true proplyds like the ones seen in orion , especially in the core of tr  14 , there are a large number of small dark clouds that probably contain young stars .",
    "we also discussed the bending ( or not ) of hh jets exposed to feedback in giant h  ii regions and how the shaping of the jets depends on their location relative to bulk flows of plasma throughout the region .",
    "in particular , we find that photoevaporative flows from the surfaces of molecular clouds and dust pillars can significantly affect a jet s morphology for sources near the periphery of a giant h  ii region .",
    "lastly , we evaluated the contribution of mass , energy , and turbulence injection by hh jets in carina , finding that jets are negligible compared to winds and radiation from massive stars .",
    "the list of objects discovered provides the largest sample of irradiated outflows in a giant h  ii region , and followup studies with ir imaging and optical spectroscopy will characterize the physics of outflows exposed to feedback in a region like that where the sun formed , and where most stars are born .",
    "hh catalog numbers are assigned by b.  reipurth in order to correspond with the list of herbig - haro objects maintained at http://ifa.hawaii.edu/reipurth/ , and we appreciate his patience in trying to assign consecutive hh numbers to our non - consecutive requests . we acknowledge input during early phases of this project from j.a .",
