    "the ads / cft correspondence is an extremely fruitful theoretical idea that played a central role in the past . in its simplest instance , it links the integrability of the world - sheet @xmath3-model for type iib superstring to the strong coupling behaviour of four dimensional gauge theories . in the specific case of planar @xmath4 super yang - mills theory ,",
    "integrability methods determine the spectrum of anomalous dimensions as a function of the t hooft coupling @xmath5 , from weak to strong coupling .",
    "more precisely , the spectrum was shown to be captured by suitable y - system equations @xcite .",
    "these equations are expected to be general and valid for any operator , including short ones .",
    "the first attempt of explorations of the flow of the anomalous dimension concerned the simplest @xmath6 sector of the theory and the simplest operator present in this sector , the konishi operator .",

    ". the sub - leading coefficient in the string theory expansion was found in @xcite .",
    "a highly nontrivial observation which allows one to reproduce the one - loop result almost without efforts was made recently in @xcite .",
    "the second nontrivial strong coupling expansion coefficient was derived analytically in @xcite by using the one - loop expression for a general @xmath7 folded string @xcite .",
