    "has been found time delay values between optical ubv and nir ( jhkl ) variations for two different luminosity cyrcles of ngc  4151 activities ( see fig.1 ) : case a ( 1969 - 1980 ) and case b ( 1990 - 1998 ) .",
    "we have found that time delay is longer for case b following to significantly more high level of luminosity in this cyrcle comparative to the past case a.    we are going to report about the new time delay determinations using optical ubv and nir data for ngc 4151 in the minimum after high state b ( then we call interval 1999 - 2004 as case c ) .",
    "the past nir time delays for ngc  4151 at cases a and b as well as new ones for case c ( this work and minezaki at al .",

    "the ratio of slow - to - fast variations amplitudes are much bigger for the case c than it was before . due to the reason we need to remove the slow components in the optical and nir light curves before using them for cross - correlation .",
    "this operation does not change the results but makes the peak in cross - correlation significanty more sharper .    as it is seen from the fig.2 time delay for @xmath0 variations from optical ones",
    "is about 100 days .",
    "our data are in very good coincidences with light curves in minezaki et al ( 2004 ) .",
    "we were able to combine the data with our results and then use the combined data for cross - correlation analysis .",
    "we have got time delay between @xmath21 and @xmath0 varations about 50 days for the same time interval as in the minezaki et al . meanwhile",
    "the result has not got any confirmation in our analysis with all optical data but the same time interval data for @xmath0 data as in minezaki et al .",
    "minezaki et al .",
    "really minezaki et al have used for analysis just two short and smooth curves with only one minimum in them .",
    "if ir and optical data have some difference at additional slow trend then obtained value for time delay might be very significantly depending from this fact .",
    "the dust ( graphite grains ) can not be survived on distances from nucleus closer than some critical value . so radiation of central source cleans dust from the inner region leaving a hole in its distribution .",
    "radii of these holes can be estimated using nir variations time delays .",
    "these time delays probably can give us redshift - independent luminosities of agns oknyanskij ( 2000 , 2002 ) .",
    "this interpretation has obvious problem if take into account strong variability of agns . if the grains are depleted when the uv luminosity peaks , and can not reform , then a dust - free hole surrounding the central source will be created with radius corresponding to the sublimation distance at the uv peak ( barvanis , 1992 ) .",
    "so to explain short nir time delay values in case a ( in despite of known from historical light curve previous very high states ) we have to involve some explanation for recovering or reformation for the dust particles .",
    "one of the way has been considered by barvanis ( 1992 ) - the dust partical can servive in clouds into the sublimation radius for the peak cases .",
    "the high state at case b was untypicaly long and dust particls probably were sublimated very significantly .",
    "so it is interesting to find from observatios how fast the dust can be recavered or reform .",
    "time delay between optical and nir variations is a variable value and it is changed with state of the nucleus activity .",
    "we have found that time delay for @xmath0 variations in the last low state is about 100 days , ie about the same as it is for @xmath1 in cases b and c.    in a case ngc 4151 we have an opportunity to investigate changes of the dust hole radius in different activity states of the nucleus and estimate that the time needed for recovering or reformation for the dust particles is longer than several years .",
    "alternative explanations can be : anisotropy of radiation field , shielding of the central source on a light of sight , and also special orientation of the dust region ."
