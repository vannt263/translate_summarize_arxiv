    "there is accumulated evidence both from astrophysics and cosmology that about 1/4 of the energy budget of the universe consists of so called dark matter  @xcite , namely a component which is non - relativistic and neither feels the electromagnetic nor the strong interaction .",
    "it is known that in the standard model of particle physics there is not a suitable dark matter candidate .",
    "supersymmetry , a very well - motivated idea , is perhaps the most popular way beyond the standard model , and it provides us with an ideal candidate for playing the role of cold dark matter in the universe .    out of the several dark matter candidates , certainly the most well - studied case is the one of the neutralino .",
    "however , the gravitino is also a very compelling candidate for several reasons .",
    "its interactions are completely fixed by the supergravity lagrangian , its mass @xmath0 is directly related to the scale at which supersymmetry is broken , and finally the reheating temperature after inflation @xmath1 , which is essential for the precise baryon asymmetry generation mechanism , plays a certain role in gravitino cosmology .",
    "the mssm  @xcite is the most economical supersymmetric extension of the standarm model .",
    "however , it suffers from the so - called @xmath2 problem  @xcite .",
    "the natural values for the higgs / higgsino mass parameter @xmath2 is either @xmath3 or the planck mass , while phenomenology requires the @xmath2 should be at the electroweak scale . the simplest supersymmetric model that solves the @xmath2 problem is the nmssm  @xcite , where one more singlet chiral superfield is introduced .",
    "it is therefore interesting to try to see whether a particular cosmological scenario , with gravitino lsp and neutralino nlsp in the framework of the nmssm , is a viable one .",
    "the particle physics model is defined by the superpotential @xmath4 as well as the soft breaking masses and couplings @xmath5 when the singlet acquires a vaccum expectation value , s , we obtain an effective @xmath2 parameter , @xmath6 .",
    "imposing universality at the gut scale , a small controllable number of free parameters remains , namely +    @xmath7    and the sign of the effective @xmath2 parameter can be chosen at will .",
    "because of the extra singlet superfield , in the nmssm there is a larger higgs sector and a larger neutralino sector .",
    "the neutralino mass matrix is characterized by the appearence of a fifth neutralino state , meaning that the composition of the lightest neutralino has an extra singlino contribution @xmath8 in the following , neutralinos with @xmath9 , or @xmath10 , will be referred to as bino- or singlino - like , respectively .",
    "furthermore , in the higgs sector we have now two cp - odd neutral , and three cp - even neutral higgses .",
    "we make the assumption that there is no cp - violation in the higgs sector , and therefore the cp - even and cp - odd states do not mix .",
    "we are not interested in the cp - odd states , while the cp - even higgs interaction and physical eigenstates are related by the transformation @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the unitary matrix that diagonalises the cp - even symmetric mass matrix , @xmath13 , and the physical eigenstates are ordered as @xmath14 .",
    "after inflation gravitinos can be produced in two ways .",
    "one way to produce gravitinos is with scatterings from the thermal bath , and another is from the out - of - equillibrium decays of the nlsp , which decouple from the thermal bath before primordial big - bang nucleosynthesis and decay after the bbn time .",
    "thus , imposing the wmap bounds  @xcite we can write for the gravitino abundance @xmath15 where @xmath16 with @xmath17 the mass of the nlsp , and @xmath18 the abundance the nlsp would have , had it not decayed into the gravitino . the thermal contribution is given by ( approximately for a light gravitino , @xmath19 )  @xcite @xmath20      the nslp is unstable with a lifetime that is typically larger than bbn time @xmath21  sec .",
    "energetic particles produced by the nlsp decay may dissociate the background nuclei and significantly affect the primordial abundances of light elements . if such processes occur with sizable rates , the predictions of the standard bbn scenario would be altered and the success of the primordial nucleosynthesis would be spoiled .",
    "bbn constraints on cosmological scenarios with exotic long - lived particles predicted by physics beyond the standard model have been studied , and here we have used the figure 2 of ref .",
    "thus , we need to compute the lifetime of the neutralino .",
    "there are three main decay channels , namely neutralino decaying into gravitino and a standard model particle that can be one of the followings : photon , z boson and higgs .",
    "the supergravity lagrangian is known , and the feynman rules for the gravitino interactions have been derived  @xcite . therefore , the neutralino lifetime is given by @xmath22 and the exact expressions for the diferent contributions can be found in  @xcite .",
    "we have used nmssmtools  @xcite , a computer software that computes the masses of the higgses and the superpartners , the couplings , and the relic density of the neutralino , for a given set of the free parameters .",
    "we have performed a random scan over the whole parameter space ( with fixed @xmath23 motivated by the muon anomalous magnetic moment ) , and we have selected only those points that satisfy i ) theoretical requirements , such as neutralino lsp , correct electroweak symmetry breaking , absence of tachyonic masses etc . , and ii ) lep bounds on the higgs mass , collider bounds on susy particle masses , and experimental data from b - physics .",
    "finally , for any given point in the cnmssm parameter space , the neutralino lifetime is a function of the gravitino mass only . imposing the bbn constraints we find the maximum allowed gravitino mass , and from the cold dark matter bound we can determine the maximum allowed reheating temperature .",
    "for all the acceptable points the lightest neutralino is either a bino or a singlino , and our main results are summarized in the figures below .    for the bino case",
    ", figure  1 shows the maximum allowed reheating temperature after inflation versus the maximum allowed gravitino mass , both in gev .",
    "although it can not be seen directly from the figures , the maximum possible gravitino mass in the bino case is @xmath24  gev , and the corresponding reheating temperature is @xmath25  gev .",
    "therefore , we see that a ) the gravitino in this scenario must be much lighter than the rest of superpatners , but nevertheless it is still in the gravity - mediated susy - breaking scheme , and b ) the reheating temperature after inflation is not large enough for thermal leptogenesis .    for the singlino case ,",
    "we show in figure  2 the maximum allowed reheating temperature versus gravitino mass , both in gev .",
    "this time the neutralino relic density is even larger than before , and gravitino now must be extremely light .",
    "this is due to the smallness of the coefficients @xmath26 in the decay rate to gravitino and photon .",
    "for the same lifetime as before , the gravitino mass must be several orders of magnitude lower than in the bino case .",
    "the last figure shows that in the singlino case the reheating temperature can not be larger than about @xmath27  gev .",
    "however , this value is much lower than the minimum value required for the computation of the gravitino thermal production @xmath28  tev , and therefore we conclude that this scenario must be excluded .",
    "in the framework of the cnmssm , we have considered a possible cosmological scenario with the gravitino lsp and the neutralino nlsp .",
    "the gravitino is stable and plays the role of cold dark matter in the universe , while the neutralino is unstable and decays to gravitino .",
    "we have taken into account the relevant gravitino production mechanisms , which are i ) the nlsp decay , and ii ) scattering processes from the thermal bath .",
    "our results can be seen in the figures .",
    "we have found that i ) the gravitino is necessarily very light , and ii ) the reheating temperature after inflation is two orders of magnitude lower than the temperature required for thermal leptogenesis .",
    "the singlino scenario must be excluded , while in the bino case it is hardly possible to have a gravitino in the gravity - mediated susy - breaking scheme .",
