    "tremendous advances have been made over the past decade in our knowledge of the quark and gluon ( or parton ) substructure of the nucleon , with the availability of new high energy scattering data from various accelerator facilities worldwide @xcite .",
    "results from the final analysis of data from the @xmath3 collider hera have allowed a detailed mapping of the partonic landscape at small values of the nucleon s parton momentum fraction @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "data from high energy @xmath4 scattering at the tevatron on weak boson and jet production have provided a wealth of complementary information on the nucleon s flavor structure . at lower energies ,",
    "precision structure function measurements at the high luminosity cebaf accelerator at jefferson lab have enabled a detailed investigation of nucleon structure at large values of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "more recently , fascinating glimpses into the role played by sea quarks and gluons in the proton have been seen in various channels in @xmath5 collisions at the lhc .    to analyze the vast amounts of data from the various facilities",
    ", concerted efforts are being made to systematically extract information about the nucleon s quark and gluon structure in the form of parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) @xcite . while much of the effort has in the past been directed at the small-@xmath2 frontier made accessible through the highest energy colliders , relatively less attention has been focused on the region of large momentum fractions , where nonperturbative qcd effects generally play a more important role .    the cteq - jefferson lab ( cj ) collaboration @xcite has performed a series of global pdf analyses @xcite with the aim of maximally utilizing data at the highest @xmath2 values amenable to perturbative qcd treatment .",
    "the additional complications of working with data down to relatively low values of four - momentum transfer @xmath6 ( @xmath7  gev@xmath8 ) and invariant final state masses @xmath9 ( @xmath10  gev@xmath8 ) have been met with developments in the theoretical description of various effects which come into prominence at such kinematics .",
    "the importance of @xmath11 power corrections , arising from target mass and higher twist effects , has been emphasized @xcite particularly in the analysis of fixed - target deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) data , which found leading twist pdfs to be stable down to low @xmath6 values with the inclusion of both of these effects .    moreover , since the cj analyses typically fit both proton and deuterium data , the description of the latter requires careful treatment of nuclear corrections at large values of @xmath2 , at all @xmath6 scales .",
    "the @xmath12-quark pdf is especially sensitive to the deuterium corrections for @xmath13 , and historically has suffered from large uncertainties due to the model dependence of the nuclear effects @xcite . to adequately allow for the full range of nuclear model uncertainties , the cj12 analysis @xcite produced three sets of pdfs corresponding to different strengths ( minimum , medium and maximum ) of the nuclear effects , which served to provide a more realistic estimate of the @xmath12-quark pdf uncertainty compared with previous fits .    in this analysis , which we refer to as `` cj15 '' , we examine the impact of new large rapidity charged lepton and @xmath0-boson asymmetry data from the tevatron @xcite on the determination of next - to - leading order ( nlo ) pdfs and their errors , particularly at large values of @xmath2 .",
    "we also include for the first time new jefferson lab data on the free neutron structure function obtained from backward spectator proton tagging in semi - inclusive dis @xcite , which do not suffer from the same uncertainties that have afflicted previous neutron extractions .",
    "we present a more complete treatment of the nuclear corrections in deuterium , examining a range of high - precision deuteron wave functions and several models for the nucleon off - shell corrections .",
    "in contrast to our earlier fits @xcite , which relied on physically - motivated models for the off - shell effects , the precision of the new data allows us to perform a purely phenomenological fit , with the off - shell parameters determined directly from the data .",
    "other improvements in the cj15 analysis include a more robust parametrization of the @xmath14 asymmetry , which accommodates different asymptotic behaviors as @xmath15 , and the implementation of the s - acot scheme @xcite for heavy quarks .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : thy ] we review the theoretical formalism underpinning our global analysis , including the choice of parametrization for the various pdfs .",
    "we discuss the treatment of mass thresholds , and the application of finite-@xmath6 corrections from target mass and higher twist effects that are necessary to describe the low-@xmath6 , large-@xmath2 data .",
    "a detailed investigation of nuclear corrections in the deuteron follows , in which we outline several models and parametrizations of nucleon off - shell corrections , which represent the main uncertainty in the computation of the nuclear effects .    in sec .",

    "here we compare the cj15 pdfs with other modern parametrizations , as well as with selected observables .",
    "in addition to the nlo analysis , we also perform a leading order ( lo ) fit , which is useful for certain applications , such as monte carlo generators or for estimating cross sections and event rates for new experiments .",
    "our central results deal with the role played by the nuclear corrections and their uncertainties in the global analysis , and how these can be reduced by exploiting the interplay of different observables sensitive to the @xmath12-quark pdf .",
    "we discuss the consequences of the new analysis for the shape of the deuteron to isoscalar nucleon structure function ratio , and the closely related question of the behavior of the @xmath1 pdf ratio at large @xmath2 . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] we summarize our results and discuss possible future improvements in pdf determination that are expected to come with new data from collider and fixed - target experiments .",
    "in this section we present the theoretical framework on which the cj15 pdf analysis is based .",
    "we begin with a discussion of the parametrizations chosen for the various flavor pdfs , noting the particular forms used here for the @xmath1 and @xmath14 ratios compared with earlier work .",
    "we then describe our treatment of heavy quarks , and the implementation of finite-@xmath6 corrections .",
    "a detailed discussion of the nuclear corrections in the deuteron follows , where we review previous attempts to account for nucleon off - shell effects , and describe the approach taken in this analysis .      for the parametrization of the pdfs at the input scale @xmath16 , chosen here to be the mass of the charm quark , @xmath17",
    ", a standard 5-parameter form is adopted for most parton species  @xmath18 , @xmath19 this form applies to the valence @xmath20 and @xmath21 distributions , the light antiquark sea @xmath22 , and the gluon distribution @xmath23 .",
    "the charm quark is considered to be radiatively generated from the gluons . to allow greater flexibility for the valence @xmath24 pdf in the large-@xmath2 region , we add in a small admixture of the valence @xmath25-quark pdf , @xmath26 with @xmath27 and @xmath28 as two additional parameters .",
    "the result of this modification is that the ratio @xmath29 as @xmath15 , provided that @xmath30 , which is usually the case .",
    "this form avoids potentially large biases on the @xmath12-quark pdf central value @xcite , as well as on its pdf error estimate @xcite , as we discuss in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] . a finite , nonzero value of the @xmath31 ratio is also expected in several nonperturbative models of hadron structure @xcite .",
    "the normalization parameters @xmath32 for the @xmath33 and @xmath24 distributions are fixed by the appropriate valence quark number sum rules , while @xmath34 is fixed by the momentum sum rule .",
    "in the cj12 pdf sets the combinations @xmath35 were parametrized separately . in that analysis",
    "it was found to be difficult to control the size of the @xmath36 distribution relative to the @xmath37 at values of @xmath2 above about 0.3 , since there were essentially no constraints on the sea quarks .",
    "consequently some fits generated @xmath36 pdfs that became negative in this region .",
    "while this had little effect on the nlo fits since the terms were very small there , it was nonetheless unsatisfactory when one considered lo fits where the pdfs are expected to be positive . in the present analysis we therefore parametrize directly the ratio @xmath14 instead of the difference @xmath38 . for the functional form of @xmath14 at the input scale @xmath16",
    "we choose @xmath39 which ensures that in the limit @xmath15 one has @xmath40 .",
    "this is actually a theoretical prejudice since the sea quark pdfs are fed by @xmath6 evolution which , in the absence of isospin symmetry violating effects , generates equal @xmath36 and @xmath37 contributions .",
    "since the existing data are not able to reliably determine the large-@xmath2 behavior of the ratio , we have also performed alternative fits using @xmath41 , which vanishes in the @xmath15 limit .",
    "data from the e866 dilepton production experiment @xcite currently provide the strongest constraints on the @xmath14 ratio and show a decrease below unity in the region @xmath42 , albeit with large errors .",
    "it was found that either parametrization could achieve excellent fits to the data included in the global analysis . in the central fits",
    "presented here we choose the parametrization in eq.([eq : dboub ] ) . in the near future",
    "the seaquest experiment ( e906 ) @xcite at fermilab is expected to yield data with higher statistical precision that will constrain the @xmath14 ratio to larger @xmath2 values , and so answer the question as to which parametrization is more suitable .    for the strange quark distribution ,",
    "the strongest constraints have traditionally come from charm meson production in neutrino dis from nuclei . in keeping with the approach adopted in our previous analyses @xcite",
    ", we do not include neutrino scattering data in the current fit because of uncertainties in relating structure functions of heavy nuclei to those of free nucleons .",
    "in particular , a proper treatment of dimuon production on nuclear targets requires inclusion of initial state as well as final state nuclear effects @xcite .",
    "the former are relatively well understood and accounted for by using nuclear pdfs @xcite .",
    "the latter , however , are much less known and include effects such as the scattered charm quark energy loss while traversing the target nucleus , or @xmath43 meson  nucleon interactions for mesons hadronizing within the nucleus .",
    "these effects have often been underestimated theoretically in the analysis of heavy - ion reactions , and are essentially unknown experimentally in nuclear dis , constituting a potentially large source of systematic uncertainty .",
    "consequently , we follow our previous strategy in assuming flavor independence of the shape of the sea quark pdfs , with a fixed ratio @xmath44 we further make the usual assumption that @xmath45 , and take @xmath46 .",
    "recently an analysis of atlas data on @xmath0 and @xmath47 production in @xmath5 collisions at the lhc claimed a significantly larger strange quark sea , with @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "however , in a combined fit to data on charm production from neutrino dis and from the lhc , alekhin _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite argued that the apparent strange quark enhancement is likely due to a corresponding suppression of the @xmath36-quark pdf at small @xmath2 .",
    "they point out that this reflects the limitations of attempts to separate individual quark flavor pdfs based solely on data from @xmath49 scattering .",
    "note that in all of these analyses the assumption is made that @xmath50 .",
    "possible differences between the @xmath51 and @xmath52 pdfs can arise from both perturbative @xcite and nonperturbative @xcite effects and could affect , for example , the extraction of the weak mixing angle from neutrino data @xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis of the strange quark pdf using lhc and other data within the cj framework will be performed in future work .",
    "the existence of heavy quark pdfs in the nucleon introduces new mass scales and leads to the appearance of logarithmic terms of the form @xmath53 in perturbative qcd calculations , where @xmath54 is the mass of the heavy quark .",
    "as @xmath6 grows these can become large and need to be resummed .",
    "the evolution equations for the pdfs sum these potentially large logarithms . in schemes where the heavy quarks are treated as massless in the hard scattering subprocesses ,",
    "the heavy quark mass enters via the boundary conditions on the pdfs at the heavy quark threshold .",
    "typically this takes the form of imposing that the heavy quark pdf vanishes for @xmath6 below @xmath55 , with massless evolution being used as @xmath6 increases .",
    "although valid asymptotically , this result does not treat the threshold region correctly , since the threshold occurs in the variable @xmath9 , not @xmath6 .    in this analysis",
    "we are interested in determining the pdfs over ranges of @xmath6 and @xmath2 that include the threshold regions for the @xmath28 and @xmath27 quarks . to correctly treat these regions we implement the s - acot scheme as presented in ref .",
    "this is a simplified version that is equivalent to the variable flavor acot scheme @xcite .",
    "the s - acot scheme has been implemented for the neutral current dis processes in the present analysis and we take the masses of the charm and bottom quarks to be @xmath56  gev and @xmath57  gev , respectively .      the cuts on @xmath6 and @xmath9 imposed on the data sets used in this analysis ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : data ] below ) significantly increase the number of data points available to constrain pdfs . while this allows access to a greater range of kinematics and",
    "leads to reduced pdf uncertainties , especially at higher values of @xmath2 , it also requires careful treatment of subleading , @xmath58 power corrections to the leading twist calculations .",
    "the most basic correction arises from imposing exact kinematics on twist - two matrix elements at finite values of @xmath6 , which gives rise to effects that scale with @xmath59 .",
    "these target mass corrections ( tmcs ) were first evaluated within the operator product expansion ( ope ) @xcite for dis processes , and allow structure functions at finite @xmath6 to be expressed in terms of their @xmath60 ( or `` massless '' ) values . for the @xmath61 structure function , for instance , one has @xcite",
    "@xmath62      { f_2^{(0)}(u , q^2 ) \\over u^2 } ,    \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\label{eq : ope_f2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 is the structure function in the @xmath60 limit . here",
    "the massless limit functions are evaluated in terms of the modified scaling variable @xmath64 @xcite , @xmath65 which approaches @xmath2 as @xmath60 .",
    "later work within the collinear factorization framework provided an alternative formulation of tmcs @xcite , which had the advantage that it could also be applied to processes other than inclusive dis @xcite .",
    "to @xmath58 the two approaches can in fact be shown to be equivalent .",
    "a number of other prescriptions have also been proposed in the literature @xcite , using different approximations to the ope and collinear factorization methods . in the context of a global pdf fit",
    ", it was found in ref .",
    "@xcite that differences arising from the various prescriptions can be effectively compensated by the presence of phenomenological higher twist terms . in the present analysis we use the standard ope expression for the tmcs in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ope_f2 ] ) .    for other subleading @xmath11 corrections , which include higher twists but also other residual power corrections ,",
    "we follow our earlier work @xcite and parametrize the correction in terms of a phenomenological @xmath2-dependent function , @xmath66 where @xmath67 denotes the leading twist structure function , including tmcs .",
    "the higher twist coefficient function is parametrized by a polynomial function as @xmath68 with @xmath69 and @xmath70 as free parameters .",
    "for simplicity we assume the high twist correction to be isospin independent ( see , however , refs .",
    "@xcite ) ; the possible isospin dependence of @xmath61 and other structure functions will be studied in a future dedicated analysis .      as in the previous cj pdf analyses @xcite , the use of deuterium dis and drell - yan data necessitates taking into account the differences between pdfs in the deuteron and those in the free proton and neutron .",
    "the cj15 analysis follows a similar approach , with several improvements over the earlier implementations , as we discuss in this section .",
    "while the earlier analyses applied nuclear corrections only to deep - inelastic deuteron structure functions , here we formulate the corrections at the parton level and generalize the treatment to any process involving quark , antiquark or gluon pdfs in the deuteron .",
    "generally , the nuclear corrections in high energy reactions account for fermi motion , binding , and nucleon off - shell effects , which are implemented in the form of convolutions with nuclear smearing functions .",
    "the nuclear effects become increasingly important at intermediate and large values of @xmath2 , and will be the focus of this section .",
    "in addition , rescattering effects mediated by pomeron and pion exchange mechanisms give rise to shadowing at small values of @xmath2 ( @xmath71 ) @xcite and a small amount of antishadowing at @xmath72 @xcite ; in this analysis we implement these using the results from ref .  @xcite . in practice , however , the shadowing and antishadowing corrections are very small , and have negligible effect on the phenomenology considered in this paper .      from the standard nuclear impulse approximation for the scattering of a projectile ( lepton or hadron ) from a deuteron @xmath12 , the momentum distribution of a parton inside the deuteron is given by a convolution of the corresponding pdf in the bound nucleon and a momentum distribution @xmath73 of nucleons in the deuteron ( or `` smearing function '' ) .",
    "taking for illustration the pdf for a quark of flavor @xmath74 ( the generalization to antiquarks and gluons is straightforward ) , its parton momentum distribution in the deuteron can be computed as @xcite @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the nucleon momentum fraction in the deuteron , with @xmath77 and @xmath78 the four - momenta of the nucleon and deuteron , respectively , and @xmath79 is the deuteron mass .",
    "the nucleon virtuality @xmath80 defines the degree to which the bound nucleon is off its mass shell , @xmath81 , and the function @xmath82 represents the quark pdf in the off - shell nucleon . for the isoscalar deuteron",
    ", a sum over the nucleons @xmath83 is implied .",
    "while the off - shell nucleon pdf @xmath82 is not by itself an observable , its dependence on the virtuality @xmath80 can be studied within a given theoretical framework .",
    "since the bound state effects in the deuteron are the smallest of all the atomic nuclei , one may expand the off - shell nucleon distribution to lowest order about its on - shell limit @xcite , @xmath84 where the coefficient of the off - shell term is given by @xmath85 the on - shell term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : qoff ] ) leads to the standard on - shell convolution representation for the nuclear pdf , while the off - shell term can be evaluated as an additive correction . defining the total quark pdf in the deuteron as the sum of the on - shell and off - shell contributions , @xmath86 ,",
    "the two components can be written as    [ eq : qd ] @xmath87    the on - shell and off - shell smearing functions @xmath88 and @xmath89 are taken to be the same for the proton and neutron ( isospin symmetry breaking effects are not expected to be significant ) and are given by @xcite    @xmath90    a systematic method for computing the smearing functions is within the weak binding approximation , in terms of the deuteron wave function @xcite . for large @xmath91 the on - shell smearing function",
    "@xmath88 has a simple probabilistic interpretation in terms of the light - cone momentum fraction @xmath92 of the deuteron carried by the struck nucleon , where @xmath93 is the `` plus '' component of the four - vector @xmath77 . at finite @xmath6 , however , the smearing functions depend also on the parameter @xmath94 , which characterizes the deviation from the bjorken limit , and the momentum fraction variable is @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the separation energy .",
    "in fact , the @xmath97 dependence of the smearing functions is different for the @xmath98 and @xmath61 dis structure functions , and for drell - yan cross sections , so that the convolutions at finite @xmath6 depend on the deuteron observable that is being computed .    for the deuteron wave functions we consider several modern potentials based on high - precision fits to nucleon ",
    "nucleon scattering data .",
    "the models differ primarily in their treatment of the short range @xmath99 interaction , while the long range part of the wave functions is constrained by the chiral symmetry of qcd and parametrized through one - pion exchange .",
    "specifically , the nonrelativistic av18 @xcite and cd - bonn @xcite @xmath99 potential models ( which fit around 3,000 data points in terms of @xmath100 parameters ) , and the more recent relativistic wjc-1 and wjc-2 @xcite potentials ( which describe almost 4,000 data points in terms 27 and 15 parameters , respectively ) , provide wave functions with a representative spread of behaviors in the low and high momentum regions . of these",
    ", the cd - bonn wave function has the softest momentum distribution , while the wjc-1 wave function has the hardest , with the others lying between the two .",
    "the differences in the strength of the high - momentum tails of the wave functions are reflected in differences between the behaviors of the nuclear corrections at large values of @xmath2 .",
    "note that the effects of the nuclear smearing corrections are not suppressed at large @xmath6 , and must be considered at all scales wherever data at @xmath101 are used @xcite .",
    "while the effects of the nuclear smearing are relatively well understood , at least in the sense that they can be directly related to the properties of the deuteron wave function , the nucleon off - shell correction in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : qoff ] ) and ( [ eq : deltafn ] ) is much more uncertain and model dependent . in the literature a number of model studies have been performed to estimate the modification of pdfs in bound nucleons relative to the free nucleon pdfs @xcite , some of which have been motivated by the original observation of the nuclear emc effect @xcite ( namely , the deviation of the nuclear to deuterium structure function ratio from unity ) .",
    "some early studies of off - shell corrections to pdfs were based on spectator quark models @xcite , in which the scattering takes place from a quark that is accompanied by a `` diquark '' system ( proton with a quark removed ) that is a spectator to the deep - inelastic collision .",
    "the scattering amplitude was represented through a quark spectral function characterized by an ultraviolet momentum cutoff scale @xmath102 and an invariant mass of the spectator system , both of which were fixed by comparing with the on - shell structure function data .",
    "the effects of nucleon off - shell corrections on global pdf analysis were explored in the cteq6x analysis @xcite using a simple analytic parametrization of the corrections computed in the relativistic quark spectator model of ref .",
    "@xcite . in the subsequent cj11 analysis @xcite a more elaborate off - shell model",
    "was considered @xcite , in which the corrections were related to the change in the nucleon s confinement radius in the nuclear medium , as well as the average virtuality of the bound nucleons .",
    "the change in the confinement radius ( or nucleon `` swelling '' ) ranged between 1.5% and 1.8% , and the virtuality of the bound nucleons @xmath103 was independently varied between @xmath104 to @xmath105 for the four deuteron wave functions discussed above .",
    "most recently , the cj12 global analysis @xcite further took into account the correlations between the nucleon swelling and the deuteron wave function , defining a set of nuclear corrections that ranged from mild ( for the hardest , wjc-1 wave function @xcite coupled to a small , 0.3% nucleon swelling ) to strong ( for the softest , cd - bonn wave function @xcite with a large , 2.1% swelling parameter ) .",
    "the entire range of nuclear corrections was consistent with the existing experimental data , with each of the cj12min , cj12mid and cj12max pdf sets giving essentially the same @xmath106 values for the global fit , @xmath107 .    in the present cj15 analysis , in order to decrease the model dependence of the off - shell correction and",
    "increase the flexibility of the fit , we follow the proposal of kulagin and petti @xcite and employ a phenomenological parametrization with parameters fitted to data . from the constraint that the off - shell correction does not modify the number of valence quarks in the nucleon , @xmath108 & = & 0 , \\label{eq : norm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one can infer that the function @xmath109 must have one or more zeros in the physical range between @xmath110 and 1 .",
    "we can therefore take the off - shell function @xmath109 to be parametrized by the form @xmath111 with the zeros @xmath112 and @xmath113 and normalization @xmath114 free parameters .",
    "in practice we fit the zero crossing parameter @xmath112 and the normalization @xmath114 , which then allows the second zero crossing @xmath113 to be determined from eq .",

    "more specifically , in the ocs model three masses for the respective spectator states ( `` @xmath121 '' for valence quarks , `` @xmath122 '' for sea quarks , and `` @xmath123 '' for gluons ) were fitted to the isoscalar valence , sea quark and gluon pdfs in the free nucleon .",

    "the jr14 analysis @xcite uses similar smearing functions to those used in our fit , but does not include nucleon off - shell corrections .",
    "furthermore , it uses the @xmath203 criterion for the 1@xmath204 confidence level , based on statistical considerations alone , introducing additional systematic uncertainties through the dependence of the fit on the input scale .",
    "the resulting uncertainty on @xmath1 is larger than that in cj15 in the intermediate-@xmath2 region , which may reflect the absence of the recent @xmath0 and lepton asymmetry data in the jr14 fit .",
    "the range of @xmath1 values extrapolated to @xmath205 is similar to the cj15 band within errors , although the form of the jr14 parametrization forces @xmath206 at @xmath191 .",
    "the cj15 uncertainty band in fig .  [ fig : du_pdfs ] is also similar to that found in the ct14 global analysis @xcite , which does not apply any nuclear corrections to deuterium data , on the basis of the somewhat higher @xmath9 cuts utilized .",
    "the ct14 analysis uses a parametrization based on bernstein polynomials multiplying a common factor @xmath207 , and fixes the exponents @xmath208 to be the same for the @xmath25- and @xmath12-quark pdfs , thereby allowing finite values of the @xmath1 ratio in the @xmath15 limit .",
    "the results of the two analyses largely overlap over much of the @xmath2 range , with the ct14 distributions being slightly above the cj15 error band at @xmath196 .",
    "this is reminiscent of the higher @xmath1 ratio observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : du_nuc ] when the nuclear corrections are switched off .",
    "finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig : du_err ] we show the @xmath1 uncertainty from the cj15 fit compared with the uncertainties obtained in fits excluding dis deuteron or @xmath0 asymmetry data . the @xmath0 asymmetry data , which are statistically dominated by the d  results , provide the main constraint on the @xmath1 ratio at @xmath101 .",
    "at @xmath189 , where the statistical power of the reconstructed @xmath0 asymmetry data becomes limited , the global deuteron dis data play a vital role in reducing the uncertainty in the @xmath1 ratio by more than 50% . at @xmath209 , the statistical power of the dis data",
    "is utilized instead to fit the off - shell function @xmath109 .",
    "the combination of these two observables provides a good illustration of the complementarity of different data sets in global fits in constraining pdfs over extended regions of @xmath2 .",
    "we have presented here results of the cj15 global nlo analysis of parton distributions , taking into account the latest developments in theory and the availability of new data .",
    "focusing particularly , but not exclusively , on the large-@xmath2 region , the new analysis features a more comprehensive treatment of nuclear corrections to deuterium data , as well as a more flexible parametrization of the su(2 ) light antiquark asymmetry , and an improved treatment of heavy quarks .",
    "in contrast to the earlier cj12 fit @xcite , which used physically motivated models for the nucleon off - shell corrections , the present analysis allows the magnitude and shape of the off - shell effects to be phenomenologically constrained directly from data .",
    "along with the expanded set of proton and deuteron dis data afforded by our less restrictive kinematic cuts @xmath210 and @xmath131  gev@xmath8 , we also include new results from the bonus experiment at jefferson lab @xcite , which provide the first determination of the neutron structure function essentially free of nuclear correction uncertainties . the greatest impact on the fits , however , comes from the new d@xmath0 asymmetry data at large rapidity @xcite , which because of their high precision and kinematic reach are able to place significant constraints on pdfs at high @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , while the previous cj12 analysis provided three sets of pdfs corresponding to a range of different deuterium and off - shell models , the new @xmath0 asymmetry data strongly favor models with smaller nuclear corrections , closer to the `` cj12min '' pdf set @xcite . within the parametrization of the nucleon",
    "off - shell corrections adopted here , our analysis has a slight preference for deuteron wave functions with softer momentum distributions , but essentially indistinguishable fits can be obtained with each of the deuteron models considered .",
    "our approach to the nuclear corrections is similar in spirit to the phenomenological analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , which makes use of dis data on a wide range of nuclear targets and finds the ratio @xmath116 to have a universal shape similar to that for @xmath211 for heavy nuclei . from the proton and deuterium data alone , however , we find no evidence for an enhancement of @xmath116 in the vicinity of @xmath149 . the only way to definitively resolve this question may be with data on the free neutron structure function that are not subject to assumptions about nuclear corrections in deuterium",
    ". the phenomenological approach of fitting the nuclear effects directly was also utilized in refs .",
    "@xcite , who parametrized the entire nuclear correction by a function that mimics both the effects of the smearing and the nucleon off - shell correction .",
    "since the nuclear physics of the deuteron at long distances is relatively well understood , our philosophy is to include in the theoretical description the effects that can be computed reliably , and parametrize those that are more strongly model dependent .    as anticipated in refs .",
    "@xcite and elaborated in ref .",
    "@xcite , the new precision measurements of observables that are sensitive to the @xmath12-quark pdf but less sensitive to nuclear corrections are seen to play an important role in allowing global qcd fits to constrain models of nuclear corrections in the deuteron . in particular , a simultaneous fit of the new @xmath0 charge asymmetry data @xcite and the slac deuteron dis structure functions @xcite is only possible when nuclear corrections are taken into account .",
    "the interplay of these two data sets within our cj15 fit has provided the first determination of the off - shell behavior of quarks in the deuteron within a global qcd context . at the same time , the @xmath1 ratio has seen a significant reduction in its uncertainty at @xmath13 , with an extrapolated range at @xmath15 from 0 to @xmath212 , or about half of the range found in the cj12 fit . this range is expected to be further reduced once new data from experiments at the energy - upgraded jefferson lab facility become available @xcite , that will probe pdfs up to @xmath213 at dis kinematics .",
    "the first of these , involving the simultaneous measurement of inclusive dis cross section from @xmath214he and @xmath214h @xcite , in which the nuclear corrections are expected to mostly cancel @xcite , is expected to begin data taking in 2016 .",
    "the current analysis provides a timely benchmark against which the upcoming experimental results can be calibrated .",
