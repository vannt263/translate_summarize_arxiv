    "we denote by @xmath35 and @xmath36 the expressions on the right - hand sides of ( [ e ] ) and ( [ o ] ) , respectively .",
    "the jockusch - propp s proof of theorem [ jpthm ] is algebraic , and no combinatorial proof has been known .",
    "let @xmath37 be a ( finite , connected ) region on the square lattice .",
    "a _ domino tiling _ of @xmath37 is a covering of @xmath37 by dominoes so that there are no gaps or overlaps .",
    "we use the notation @xmath38 for the number of domino tilings of the region @xmath37 .",
    "the _ aztec diamond _ of order @xmath0 is the union of all unit squares inside the contour @xmath39 .",
    "the aztec diamond of order @xmath40 is shown in figure [ qa ] .",
    "it has been proven that the number of domino tilings of the aztec diamond of order @xmath0 is @xmath41 .",
    "see @xcite for the four original proofs ; and e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for further proofs .",
    "jockusch and propp @xcite introduced three types of _ quartered aztec diamonds _ ( denoted by @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 ) obtained by dividing the aztec diamond of order @xmath0 into four parts by two zigzag cuts passing the center as in figure [ qa ] ( for @xmath45 ) .",
    "they proved that the domino tilings of the quartered aztec diamond are enumerated by @xmath35 or @xmath36 , where @xmath30 are the first @xmath46 odd positive integers or the first @xmath46 even positive integers .",
    "the author gave a new proof for this result by using ciucu s factorization theorem ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.2 ) ) in @xcite .",
    "# 1#2#3#4#5 @font    # 1#2#3#4#5 @font    besides the aztec diamonds , we are also interested in a similar family of regions called _ aztec rectangles _ ( see figure [ qaztec2](a ) for the aztec rectangle of size @xmath47 ) .",
    "denote by @xmath48 the aztec rectangle region having @xmath49 squares along the southwest side and @xmath0 squares along the northwest side .",
    "we also consider the _ trimmed aztec rectangle _",
    "@xmath50 obtained from the ordinary @xmath48 by removing all squares running along its northwest and northeast sides ( illustrated in figure [ qaztec2](d ) ) .",
    "we generalize the jockusch - propp s quartered aztec diamonds as follows . remove all squares at even positions ( from the bottom to top ) on the southwest side of @xmath48 , and remove arbitrarily @xmath51 squares on the southeast sides .",
    "assume that we are removing all squares , except for the @xmath52-st , the @xmath53-nd , @xmath54 , and the @xmath55-th ones , from the southeast side , and denote by @xmath56 the resulting region ( see figure [ qaztec2](b ) ) .",
    "we also have an odd - analog @xmath57 of the above region when removing odd squares ( instead of the even ones ) from the southwest side , and removing all squares from the southeast side , except for the squares at the positions @xmath58 ( illustrated in figure [ qaztec2](c ) ) .",
    "if we remove all even squares on the southwest side of the trimmed aztec rectangle @xmath50 , and also remove the squares at the positions @xmath58 from its southeast side , we get the region @xmath59 ( shown in figure [ qaztec2](e ) ) . repeating the process with the odd squares on the southwest side removed , we get the region @xmath60 ( pictured in figure [ qaztec2](f ) ) .",
    "we call each of the above four regions a _ quartered aztec rectangle _ ( qar ) .",
    "we notice that the quartered aztec diamonds of order @xmath61 are obtained from the @xmath62- and @xmath63-qars by specializing @xmath64 and @xmath65 or @xmath66 , depending on the region considered ; and the quartered aztec diamonds of order @xmath67 are obtained similarly from the @xmath68- and @xmath69-qars having size @xmath70 .    surprisingly , the functions @xmath35 and @xmath36 in theorem [ jpthm ] also counts the domino tilings of the qars .",

    "the proof extends an idea of jockusch and propp for the case of quartered aztec diamonds . on the other hand ,",
    "our combinatorial proof and theorem [ trithm ] yield a combinatorial proof for jockusch - propp s theorem [ jpthm ] .",
    "finally , it is worth to notice that ciucu ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theore 4.1 ) showed a related correspondence between the domino tilings of the _ aztec rectangle with holes _",
    "( i.e. aztec rectangle with certain squares removed ) and a 2-enumeration of the so - called _ alternating sign matrices _ , which in turn are in bijection with the monotone triangles ( see @xcite ) . however ,",
    "the 2-enumeration of alternating sign matrices ( or monotone triangles ) does _ not _ imply the 2-enumeration of amts in theorem [ jpthm ] ; and the enumeration of tilings of an aztec rectangle with holes does _ not _ imply directly the tiling formula of the qars either .",
    "we prove only the equalities ( [ main1 ] ) and ( [ main3 ] ) , as ( [ main2 ] ) and ( [ main4 ] ) can be obtained by a perfectly analogous manner .    in this proof",
    ", we always rotate the qars by @xmath81 clockwise to help the visualization of our arguments .",
    "first , we can see that the dominoes on the top of @xmath82 are all forced ; and by removing these dominoes , we get the region @xmath83 .",
    "this implies that the two qars in ( [ main1 ] ) have the same number of domino tilings .",
    "thus , we only need to show that @xmath84          color the region @xmath83 black and white so that any two squares sharing an edge have different colors , and that the bottommost squares are black . given a tiling @xmath89 of the region .",
    "figure [ amt2](a ) shows a sample domino tiling of the qar ( with @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 ) .",
    "we say a black square is _ matched upward _ or _ matched downward _ , depending on whether the white square covered by the same domino is above or below it .",
    "we use the arrows to show in figure [ amt2](a ) the dominoes containing matched - upward black squares .",
    "the qar ( rotated by @xmath81 ) can be partitioned into @xmath96 rows of squares ; and we call these rows black or white depending on the color of their squares .",
    "we now describe the amt @xmath97 .",
    "we label all black squares on each row by @xmath98 from left to right ( we also label all black squares removed on the bottommost row ) .",
    "denote by @xmath99 the black square at the position @xmath100 on the @xmath101-th row ( from the top ) .",
    "the positive entries in the @xmath101-th row of @xmath102 are the labels ( positions ) of the matched - upward squares on the @xmath101-th black row . by the antisymmetry",
    ", @xmath102 is completely determined by its positive entries ( see the illustration in figure [ amt2](b ) ; the positive entries of the amt are restricted inside the dotted right triangle ) .",
    "we would like to show that @xmath103 is well defined , i.e. we will verify that @xmath104 . consider the strip consisting of @xmath105 top rows in the qar , for @xmath106 .",
    "there are @xmath107 black squares and @xmath108 white squares in this strip .",
    "thus , there are @xmath109 white squares in the strip , which are matched with some black squares outside the strip",
    ". these must be @xmath109 white squares on the @xmath110-th white row , and those white squares are matched with some black squares on the @xmath101-th black row .",
    "it means that there are @xmath109 matched - upward black squares on the @xmath101-th black row ; equivalently , the @xmath101-th row of @xmath102 has exactly @xmath109 positive entries .",
    "since each row of @xmath102 records the positions of matched - upward squares in a black row , the entries in each row of @xmath102 are strictly increasing from left to right .",
    "we now want to verify that the entries in each diagonal are weakly increasing from left to right .",
    "since @xmath102 is antisymmetric , we only need to prove this monotonicity for the right half of @xmath102 , which contains all positive entries .",
    "assume that the @xmath101-th row of @xmath102 has the positive entries @xmath111 , where @xmath112 .",
    "we only need to show that @xmath113 for any odd @xmath101 , and that @xmath114 for any even @xmath101 .",
    "we consider first the case when @xmath101 is odd .",
    "consider the first inequality @xmath115 .",
    "we assume otherwise that @xmath116 , then by definition , all ( black ) squares @xmath117 are matched downward .",
    "however , the square @xmath118 can not be matched upward , since all white neighbor squares above it are already matched with other black squares , a contradiction ( see figure [ amt3](a ) for @xmath119 ; the upper black row is the @xmath110-th one ; the matched - downward squares on the @xmath101-th black row are not shown in the picture ; and the square having black core indicates the square that can not be matched ) .",
    "_ + since @xmath123 , we only need to show that @xmath124 .",
    "assume otherwise that @xmath125 , then same situation as in the previous paragraph happens with the square @xmath126 : all of its upper white neighbors are matched with other black squares , so it can not be matched upward , a contradiction ( see figure [ amt3](b ) for the case @xmath119 and @xmath127 ; the square having black core indicates the one can not be matched ) .",
    "+ _ case 2 .",
    "@xmath128 . _ + one can see that the dominoes containing the black squares @xmath129 are all forced , and these black squares are all matched downward ( see figures [ amt4](a ) and ( b ) for the two possibility in the case when @xmath130 and @xmath131 ) .",
    "thus , the second match - upward square in the @xmath110-th black row must be on the right of @xmath132 , this means that @xmath133 .",
    "thus , we only need to show that @xmath124 . again , assume otherwise that we have the opposite inequality @xmath125 . in this case , the square @xmath126 can not be matched upward , a contradiction ( see the two possible cases in figure [ amt5 ] ) .",
    "we now consider the case when @xmath101 is even .",
    "the leftmost inequality in ( [ ineq2 ] ) , @xmath138 , follows easily from considering forced dominoes .",
    "similar to the case of odd @xmath101 , by considering two cases when @xmath139 and when @xmath140 , we get now the inequality @xmath141 .",
    "then ( [ ineq2 ] ) is obtained by applying this argument repeatedly .    in summary",
    ", @xmath142 is indeed an amt of order @xmath61 .",
    "moreover , since all black squares on the bottom of the qar must be matched upward , the positive entries in the bottommost row of @xmath102 are @xmath143 .",
    "therefore , @xmath144 , and the map @xmath103 is well defined .",
    "next , we want to compute the cardinality of the set @xmath147 for any given amt @xmath148 , i.e. we want to find out how many different domino tilings of @xmath83 corresponding to @xmath102 .",
    "let @xmath146 be the set of positive entries of @xmath102 which do not appear in the row above ( see the circled entries in figure [ amt2b](b ) ) .",
    "we assign to each black square of @xmath83 a label @xmath149 or @xmath150 , so that only the black squares @xmath151 have label @xmath149 , and all other ones have label @xmath150 .",
    "a tiling @xmath89 corresponds to @xmath102 if and only if all @xmath149-squares are matched upward and all @xmath150-squares are matched downward in @xmath89 .",
    "view the qar @xmath83 as the union of @xmath152 columns of black or white squares .",
    "imagine that we are dropping dominoes to cover successively the squares in the first black column , so that the ones with label @xmath149 ( resp . , @xmath150 )",
    "are matched upward ( resp .",
    ", downward ) .",
    "one can see that all the dominoes are forced , except for those cases when a @xmath149-square stays right below a @xmath150-square ( this correspond to a @xmath24 in one row of @xmath102 but not in the row above it ) . at each exceptional place ,",
    "we have two ways cover these two black squares by two parallel dominoes , which create a @xmath153 block ( see the @xmath154-blocks restricted by the bold contours in figure [ amt2b](a ) ) . if we now drop dominoes to cover the squares in the second black column , all dominoes are forced , except for some @xmath153-block corresponding to a @xmath27 that appears in some row of @xmath102 but not in the preceding row .",
    "continuing in this way , one can see that the whole tiling is forced , except for certain @xmath153-blocks corresponding to the elements of @xmath146 .",
    "since each block can be covered in two ways , the number of tilings @xmath89 corresponding to @xmath102 is @xmath155 . in particular , @xmath103 is surjective ; and we obtain @xmath156 which implies ( [ main1 ] ) .",
    "next , we prove the equality ( [ main3 ] ) .",
    "similar to ( [ main1 ] ) , the first equality follows from the fact that @xmath157 is obtained by removing forced dominoes on the top of @xmath158 .",
    "thus , we only need to show that @xmath159      we construct a map @xmath160 similar to @xmath103 in the proof of ( [ main1 ] ) , the only difference is that the @xmath101-th row of the amt @xmath161 records the positions of the squares on the @xmath101-th black row , which are _ not _ matched upward ( _ including the squares removed on the bottom of @xmath162 _ ) .",
    "figure [ amt6 ] illustrates the map @xmath163 for @xmath164 , @xmath91 , @xmath165 , @xmath166 , and @xmath167 .",
    "similar to the equality ( [ main1 ] ) , one can verify that @xmath161 is indeed an amt in @xmath168 , i.e. @xmath163 is well defined .",
    "similarly , given an amt @xmath169 . by doing the same domino - dropping process",
    ", we get that there are now @xmath170 tilings of @xmath157 corresponding to @xmath102 , where @xmath171 is the set of positive entries of @xmath102 , which do not appear in the row _ below_.",
    "it means that @xmath172 , and @xmath163 is surjective .",
    "we now compare the cardinalities of two sets @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "denote by @xmath175 the @xmath101-th row of @xmath102 , and @xmath176 and @xmath177 .",
    "partition @xmath102 into two sets @xmath178 , the set of all entries on the even rows , and @xmath179 , the set of all entries on the odd rows .",
    "we will compare the numbers of elements of @xmath180 and @xmath181 in each of these subsets .    remove the positive entries , which appear in both rows @xmath182 and @xmath183 . by the definition ,",
    "the remaining positive entries on @xmath182 are in @xmath184 and the remaining positive ones on @xmath183 are in @xmath185 . since @xmath183 has one positive entry more than @xmath182 ( since each row @xmath186 has @xmath187 positive entries , and @xmath188 ) , we have @xmath189 , for @xmath190 . adding up all latter equalities for @xmath190 , we have @xmath191 .",
    "similarly , we have @xmath192 , for @xmath193 , so @xmath194 .",
