    "the inner parts of some spiral galaxies show higher star formation rates than usual and this star formation is frequently arranged in a ring or pseudo - ring pattern around their nuclei . in general ,",
    "circumnuclear star forming regions ( cnsfr ) , also referred to as `` hotspots '' , are alike luminous and large disk hii regions , but look more compact and show higher peak surphace brightness ( kennicut et al .",
    "1989 ) . in many cases",
    "they contribute substantially to the uv emission of the entire nuclear region ( _ e.g. _ colina et al .",
    "their h@xmath1 luminosities overlap with those of hii galaxies being typically higher than 10@xmath2 erg s@xmath3 which points to relatively massive ionizing star clusters .",
    "these regions are expected to show a high metallicity as corresponds to their position near the galactic bulge .",
    "they have considerable weight in the determination of abundance gradients , which in turn are widely used to constrain chemical evolution models , and constitute excellent laboratories to study how star formation proceeds in high metallicity environments .",
    "12 cnsfrs were observed with the 4.2 m wht at the roque de los muchachos observatory using the isis double spectrograph , with the eev12 and tek4 detectors in the blue and red arm respectively with the dichroic at @xmath47500   .",
    "gratings r300b in the blue arm and r600r in the red arm were used , covering the spectral ranges @xmath43650 - @xmath47000  in the blue and ( @xmath48850 -@xmath49650 ) in the near ir , yielding spectral dispersions of 1.73  pixel@xmath3 in the blue arm and 0.79  pixel@xmath3 in the red arm .",
    "a slit width of 1 arcesec was used .",
    "the nominal spatial sampling was 0.4 arcsec pixel@xmath3 in each frame and the average seeing for this night was @xmath51.2 arcsec .",
    "the data were reduced using the iraf ( image reduction and analysis facility ) package following standard procedures .",
    "the high spectral dispersion used in the near infrared allowed the almost complete elimination of the night - sky oh emission lines and , in fact , the observed @xmath49532/@xmath49069 ratio is close to the theoretical value of 2.48 in all cases .",
    "telluric absorptions have been removed from the spectra of the regions by dividing by a relatively featureless continuum of a subdwarf star observed in the same night .",
    "examples of blue and red spectra are shown in figure 1 .",
    "emission line fluxes were measured using the iraf splot software package .",
    "the presence of a conspicuous underlying stellar population , more evident in the blue spectra , in most observed regions complicates the measurements .",
    "an example of underlying absorption can be seen in the inset to the left panel of figure 1 . a two - component ( emission and absorption )",
    "gaussian fit was performed in order to correct the balmer lines for underlying absorption .",
    "an example of this procedure is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the low excitation of the regions , as evidenced by the weakness of the [ oiii ] @xmath4 5007   line ( see left panel of figure 1 ) , precludes the detection and measurement of the auroral [ oiii ] @xmath4 3463   necessary for the derivation of the electron temperature .",
    "it is therefore impossible to obtain a direct determination of the oxygen abundances .",
    "empirical calibrations have to be used instead . in the left panel of figure 3",
    "we show the calibration of oxygen abundance by the commonly used @xmath6 parameter defined as @xmath7\\lambda 3727,29 + [ oiii]\\lambda 4959,5007)/h_\\beta$ ] ( pagel et al .",
    "data on hii galaxies , disc hii regions and cnsfr are shown . the hii region sample (",

    "solid ones for our observed objects and open ones for regions in ngc  3310 and ngc  7714 , known to have under - solar abundances ( pastoriza et .",
    "1993 ; gonzlez - delgado et al .",
    "as can be seen the calibration is two - folded , shows a considerable scatter and its high abundance end is not well sampled .",
    "the position of the observed cnsfr is indicated .",
    "their observed @xmath6 values , lower than those of the lowest abundance galaxy known ( izw18 ) , indicates that cnsfr belong to the high abundance branch of the calibration showing possibly the highest metallcities shown by hii region like objects . in the right panel of figure 3",
    "the position of the regions is indicated in the @xmath11 ( [ nii]/ h@xmath12 ) abundance calibration diagram ( denicol et al .",
    "2002 ) , which shows a linear behaviour .",
    "again cnsfr appear to show the highest oxygen abundances .",
    "the left panel of figure 4 shows the [ nii]/[oii ] ratio _ versus _ the @xmath11 abundance parameter .",
    "since a good correlation has been found to exist between the [ nii]/[oii ] ratio and the n@xmath13/o@xmath13 ionic abundance ratio , which in turn can be assumed to measure the n / o ratio , this graph is the observational equivalent of the n / o _ vs _ o / h diagram .",
    "we can see that a very tight correlation exists for all represented objects : hii galaxies , low and high abundance hii regions and cnsfr .",

    "1991 ) , and the @xmath11 parameter .",
    "it can be seen that the observed cnsfr show the lowest excitation of the sample .",
    "a hint on the ionizing temperature of the regions can be obtained through the use of the @xmath0 parameter , which is a measure of the softness of the ionizing radiation ( see vlchez & pagel 1988 ) and increases with decreasing ionizing temperature .",
