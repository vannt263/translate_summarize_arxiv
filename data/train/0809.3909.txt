    "reionization marks a crucial event in the history of the universe , when the first sources of ultra - violet ( uv ) radiation ionize the neutral intergalactic medium ( igm ) and affect the subsequent formation of the cosmic structures .",
    "when reionization ends , the small amount of left neutral hydrogen is responsible for the absorption lines that we observe today in the spectra of far objects .",
    "however , the way in which this complex phenomenon occurs is still not well understood and the most recent observations paint it as a spatially inhomogeneous and not istantaneous process . while the gunn & peterson trough of the high-@xmath2 qso spectra suggests a late epoch of reionization at @xmath3 @xcite , the very recent analysis of the 5-year wmap data on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) polarization shows an igm optical depth @xmath4 which is in better agreement with an earlier reionization redshift , @xmath5 @xcite . on the other hand , a late reionization end at @xmath6 is also probed by the igm temperature measured at @xmath7 @xcite and by the lack of evolution in the luminosity function of lyman-@xmath8 galaxies between @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( * ? ? ?",

    "* ) have been proposed to describe this poorly understood reionization process .",
    "they basically relate the statistical properties and morphology of the ionized regions to the hierarchical growth of the ionizing sources , making more or less detailed assumptions to describe the ionization and recombination processes acting on the igm .",
    "since the first sources of uv background radiation appear in the firstly formed dark matter haloes , which correspond to the highest peaks of the primordial density field , the reionization process is expected to strongly depend on the main parameters describing the cosmological model and the power spectrum of primordial density fluctuations .",
    "for instance , the possible presence of an evolving component of dark energy can imprint signatures in the resulting morphology of the ionized regions and change the time - scales of the whole process ( see , e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "also the nature and the statistical distribution of the primordial matter fluctuations can influence the reionization history .",
    "although the standard scenario for the origin of the structures assumes that the primordial perturbations are adiabatic and have a ( almost ) gaussian distribution , small deviations from primordial gaussianity affect the dark halo counts , in the rare - event tail , thus also in the high peaks of the density field which originated collapsed objects at high @xmath2 .",
    "aim of this work is to investigate the effects of some level of non - gaussianity in the primordial density field on the reionization history .",
    "we will make use of analytical techniques to describe the processes in action on the igm .",
    "in particular , we will extend previous works in which the considered non - gaussian models have density fluctuations described by a renormalized @xmath12 probability distribution with @xmath13 degrees of freedom @xcite or by a modified poisson distribution with a given expectation value @xmath14 @xcite . here",
    "we will adopt a more convenient way to introduce primordial non - gaussianity , which has now become standard in the literature , based on the parameter @xmath0 ( see the next section for its definition ) .",
    "in particular , we will assume two different kinds of non - gaussianity , characterized by a scale - independent and a scale - dependent @xmath0 parameter .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section [",
    "sect : ng ] we introduce the main characteristics of the cosmological models with primordial non - gaussianity considered here .",
    "section [ sect : model ] reviews the main assumptions of the analytical model adopted to describe the cosmic reionization process .",
    "the main results of our analysis are presented and discussed in section [ sect : res ] .",
    "finally in section [ sect : conclu ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to study the process of reionization under the assumption that the formation of the first ionizing sources is driven by the spherical collapse of overdense regions in a non - gaussian primordial density field .",
    "the predicted reionization history will be compared to that obtained assuming the ` standard ' model , with a gaussian distribution of primordial perturbations , that will represent our ` reference ' case .",
    "all the models considered in this work share the cosmological parameters suggested by the recent analysis of the 5-year wmap data @xcite : a @xmath15cdm cosmology where the contributions to the present density parameter from dark matter , cosmological constant and baryons are @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , respectively ; the hubble constant ( in units of 100 km / s / mpc ) is @xmath19 .",
    "the normalization of the cold dark matter power spectrum is fixed by assuming @xmath20 and the primordial spectral index is taken to be @xmath21 .",
    "we will describe the level of primordial non - gaussianity using the dimensionless parameter @xmath0 which weighs the quadratic correction to the linear gaussian term in bardeen s gauge - invariant potential @xmath22 : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a gaussian random field and @xmath25 denotes a convolution . on scales smaller than the hubble radius ,",
    "@xmath22 is minus the usual newtonian gravitational potential . with our convention",
    ", a positive value for @xmath0 leads to a positive skewness for the distribution of the matter density fluctuations .    as shown by eq.([eq:1a ] ) , in general the non - gaussian contribution to the gravitational potential @xmath22 can be written as a convolution between a space- and/or shape - dependent @xmath26 and the quadratic term @xmath27 .",
    "the possible dependences of @xmath28 are often neglected in the literature : this is done mostly for sake of simplificity , but it can motivated by the small _ r.m.s .",
    "_ value of @xmath22 . in this case",
    "the bispectrum of the gravitational potential , defined as @xmath29 @xmath30 being dirac s delta function , assumes a dependence on the wavenumbers called _ local shape _ , for which the term @xmath31 can be expressed as @xmath32\\ .\\ ] ] in the previous equation @xmath33 represents the normalized power - spectrum of @xmath22 .",
    "bispectra which can be expressed like in eq.([eq:1f ] ) are typical for models where the non - gaussianity is produced outside the horizon or when the inflaton has a varying decay rate .",
    "it can be shown that eq.([eq:1f ] ) assumes the largest values for squeezed configurations , i.e. when one wavenumber is much smaller than the other two .",
    "alternative models for primordial non - gaussianity , based on a single field with higher derivative terms , predict a different shape for the bispectrum , having the so - called _",

    "the maximum amplitude of the bispectrum is where the wavenumbers are all equal .",
    "we refer to @xcite for an extended discussion about the role of bispectrum shapes in the parametrization of primordial non - gaussianity and @xcite for a review on the predictions for @xmath0 in different inflationary models .    at present ,",
    "the strongest constraints on the parameter @xmath0 are based on cmb data . analysing the 5-year temperature maps obtained by the satellite wmap",
    ", @xcite derived @xmath35 when the local shape for the bispectrum is assumed , and @xmath36 for the equilateral shape .",
    "both limits have been estimated at the 95 per cent confidence level .",
    "the fact that the presence of some amount of primordial non - gaussianity alters the growth of density fluctuations and then the formation and evolution of cosmic structures , suggests that the large - scale structure ( lss ) of the universe can be an alternative powerful probe for @xmath0 , which has also the important advantage of being based mostly on three - dimensional data .",
    "many theoretical studies , based both on analytic and numerical analyses , have investigated the constraining capability of different observables like the abundances of virialised objects like clusters @xcite , halo biasing @xcite , galaxy bispectrum @xcite , density mass field distribution @xcite and topology @xcite , integrated sachs - wolfe effect @xcite , low density intergalactic medium and the lyman-@xmath8 flux @xcite , 21-centimeter fluctuations @xcite , and reionization , as discussed in this paper . in general , the application of these theoretical results to real lss data provided weaker constraints on @xmath0 with respect to the cmb .",
    "the only exception is the very recent analysis made by @xcite , who applied the bias formalism to a compendium of large - scale data , including the spectroscopic and photometric luminous red galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , the sdss photometric quasars and the cross - correlation between galaxies and dark matter via integrated sachs - wolfe effect . considering the local shape",
    "only , they found @xmath37 ( at 95 per cent confidence level ) .",
    "it is important to notice that the scales probed by cmb and lss are generally different and can give complementary information on @xmath0 if the primordial non - gaussianity is assumed to be scale - dependent ( see the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "in this work , we consider non - gaussian model with bispectrum having both the local and equilateral shapes .",
    "we will use values for @xmath28 in the range constrained by the 5-year wmap results @xcite , i.e. @xmath35 and @xmath36 for local and equilateral shapes , respectively . in the last case",
    ", we also allow the non - gaussianity to vary with the scale , assuming the dependence proposed by @xcite , namely : @xmath38 the normalisation of the previous relation is chosen in order to avoid violating the wmap constraints : for this reason @xmath0 represents the equilateral parameter measured on the @xmath39 scale of @xmath40mpc , roughly corresponding to largest multipole used by @xcite to estimate the non - gaussianity in the wmap data , @xmath41 .",
    "the slope @xmath8 is a free parameter , assumed to be constant , such that @xmath42 between cmb and cluster scales .",
    "following @xcite we consider small negative values for @xmath8 , to enhance the non - gaussianity on scales smaller than cmb .",
    "the resulting behaviour for the @xmath0 parameter is shown in fig.[fig:00a ] , where we assume @xmath43 , for the slope of the scale dependence , and @xmath44 , and @xmath45 as pivoting values at the cmb scale , in agreement with the wmap equilateral constraints .",
    "it is evident from the plot that , with our assumption for the scale - dependence relation of non - gaussianity , the absolute value of @xmath0 at the scales relevant for the halo formation , and then for reionization , can be a factor 2 - 3 larger than the maximum amount directly derived from the cmb analysis : this can amplify the possible effects of primordial non - gaussianity .",
    "furthermore , we note that the possible non - gaussianity probes also are based on observational data coming from different ranges of redshift .",
    "deviations from gaussianity influence the evolution of the density fluctuations , and affect the distribution of the virialized dark matter haloes at a given cosmological epoch .",
    "this reflects on the mass function : its high - mass tail is enhanced ( reduced ) in case of positive ( negative ) values of @xmath0 .",
    "while in the gaussian case , the @xcite ( ps74 hereafter ) approach , together with its modern improvements @xcite , represent powerful tools to model the evolution of the ionizing sources , for mildly non - gaussian fields it is possible to make use of the analytic relation found by @xcite extending the ps74 formalism , which has been positively tested against the results of high - resolution n - body simulations by @xcite . if @xmath46 represents the density of dark matter haloes with mass @xmath47 at redshift @xmath2 as obtained assuming gaussian initial conditions , here modeled assuming the relation found by @xcite , the corresponding expression for a non - gaussian models having the same cosmological parameters can be written as @xmath48 where the correction factor @xmath49 is given by @xmath50\\bigg |\\exp\\bigg(\\frac{\\delta^{3}_{c}s_{3}}{6\\sigma^{2}_{m}}\\bigg)\\ .\\ ] ] in the previous relation @xmath51 , @xmath52 represents the collapse threshold at @xmath2 , @xmath53 is the mass variance at @xmath54 and @xmath55 is the normalized skewness of the primordial density field on mass scale @xmath47 , namely @xmath56 .",
    "then in order to compute the mass function for non - gaussian models it is necessary to evaluate the third - order moment @xmath57 , that depends on the bispectrum of the gravitational potential @xmath58 : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the fourier transform of a spherical top - hat function on the mass scale @xmath47 , @xmath61 , being @xmath62 the cold dark matter transfer function and @xmath63 is required to go from the gravitational potential to the density via the poisson equation .    in fig.[fig:0a ]",
    "we show , as a function of the halo mass , @xmath57 and @xmath64 , for models with both local and equilateral shapes .",
    "both skewness parameters are given per unit non - gaussianity parameter @xmath0 ; for the equilateral case we also consider the possibility of scale - dependence for the non - gaussian term .",
    "as already shown by @xcite , the two classes of models give quite different predictions for both the amplitude and the mass dependence of the two considered quantities , but this discrepancy decreases as the mass scale increases , since the local and the equilateral cases become more and more similar .",
    "the scale - dependence of @xmath0 strongly affects the non - gaussianity contribution for the smaller masses scales and this effect grows when higher negative @xmath8 parameters are assumed .        inserting the values for @xmath65 in eq.([eq:1d ] )",
    ", we can estimate the effects of primordial non - gaussianity on the dark matter halo distribution at the cosmological epochs relevant for the process of reionization .",
    "the results , shown in terms of ratio with respect to the gaussian predictions , are shown in fig.[fig:1a ] , for both local and equilateral shapes ( upper and lower panels , respectively ) .",
    "here we adopt for the @xmath0 parameter at the cmb scale the values corresponding to the 95 per cent confidence level , as derived from the 5-year wmap data:@xmath66 for the local shape , and @xmath67 for equilateral one .",
    "since the mass density probability function is positively skewed in case of positive ( @xmath68 ) non - gaussian contributions , the probability of overcoming the collapse threshold becomes higher . as a consequence ,",
    "the formation of high - mass haloes is enhanced and anticipated when @xmath68 .",
    "[ fig:1a ] shows that the mass function can be increased by a factor of 10 at @xmath69 for haloes with mass @xmath70 when compared to the standard scenario .",
    "we should however remark that high - mass haloes ( @xmath71 ) at early cosmological epochs are rare events , as shown also by the small number density at @xmath69 in the reference case , @xmath72/mpc@xmath73 .",
    "then this effect is expected to have a little impact on integrated quantities as the total ionized fraction ot the igm optical depth . unlike the local model ,",
    "the scale dependence of non - gaussianity increases the abundance of the low - mass haloes by a factor of @xmath1 at @xmath69 when compared to the standard case .",
    "the opposite applies for @xmath74 .",
    "as already noticed by @xcite [ see also @xcite ] , this effect is more evident at early cosmological epochs , exactly when the process of igm ionization starts .",
    "for this reason a non - gaussian distribution of the primordial density field can affect the way in which reionization occurs , leaving its imprints on it , as we will investigate in the next sections .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the main assumptions underlying the analytic model adopted to describe the process of cosmic reionization .",
    "this model is based on the approach proposed by @xcite [ see also @xcite for further details ] ; our implementation , however , differs in some aspects which will be discussed later .    in this model , the statistical properties of the ionized regions",
    "are related to the hierarchical growth of the ionizing sources through simple assumptions on how the galaxies ionize the igm and on how the igm recombines . a one - to - one correspondence between the distribution of galaxies and hii regions is established , such that a single galaxy of mass @xmath75 can ionize a region of mass @xmath76 . here",
    "@xmath77 represents the ionization efficiency of the galaxy , and it is strictly dependent on the nature of the ionizing sources",
    ". we will take it as a constant , fixed in such a way that reionization ends at @xmath10 .",
    "since at high @xmath2 the cooling of the gas becomes efficient in haloes having a virial temperature @xmath78 k , unlike in @xcite , in our analysis we consider only type ia ( @xmath79 k @xmath80 k ) and type ib ( @xmath81 k ) haloes , neglecting the contribution of the type ii sources , which would correspond to haloes with @xmath82 k @xmath83 k. we recall that the distinction between the halo types is related to the way in which they impact the igm : type ia sources can grow only in neutral regions , while type ib haloes can appear also in ionized regions .",
    "consequently they affect differently the ionization phases of igm .",
    "the total collapsed fraction @xmath84 at different redshifts can be computed using eq.([eq:1c ] ) : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the present - day matter density and @xmath87 is the minimum mass corresponding to the virial temperature @xmath88 , which can be computed by inverting the relation proposed by @xcite , namely : @xmath89 in the previous equation , @xmath90 represents the virial overdensity at redshift @xmath2 and @xmath91 is the matter density parameter at redshift @xmath2 .",
    "consequently , the collapsed fractions in ia and ib haloes are given by @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 are the minimum masses for ib and ia sources , obtained using in eq.([eq:3a ] ) @xmath95 and @xmath79 k , respectively .",
    "the action of the ionizing sources is smoothed down by the recombination of the igm , here considered as a homogeneous gas .",
    "the recombination rate is linearly dependent on the igm clumping factor @xmath96 , for which , following @xcite , we assume a redshift evolution modeled as : @xmath97 being @xmath98 a free parameter . as shown by @xcite , the predicted reionization history of the universe",
    "has significant uncertainties introduced by the poor knowledge of the @xmath2-dependence of the clumping factor , which can not be robustly constrained even considering the 3-year wmap results for the reionization optical depth . since they found good consistency between predicted and observed optical depths irrespectively of the amount of primordial non - gaussianity in the models they consider , we decide to set @xmath99 .",
    "in this case , the @xmath2-dependence of @xmath100 is neglected and @xmath101 .",
    "the impact of the assumption of a constant clumping factor will be discussed later .",
    "the probability that a photon emitted at a given cosmological epoch @xmath102 is still ionizing at @xmath103 can be written as @xmath104 with @xmath105 , being @xmath106 the recombination coefficient of hi ( @xmath107 cm@xmath73/s at @xmath109 k ) and @xmath110/@xmath111 the hydrogen density at redshift @xmath2 .",
    "then , the filling factor @xmath112 at a given cosmological epoch is @xmath113\\times\\nonumber\\\\ & \\times&\\frac{\\mathrm{d}f_{{\\rm coll},ia}}{\\mathrm{d}z'}(z')\\bigg\\}p(z',z)\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the ionizing efficiency is assumed to be the same for the different types of haloes .",
    "we notice that the different nature of type ib and ia sources appears in the right - hand side of eq.([eq:2e ] ) , where the @xmath114 factor explicitly considers that type ia haloes form only in neutral regions .",
    "finally , the hii filling factor allows us to estimate the reionization optical depth as follows : @xmath115 here @xmath116 represents the cross - section of the thompson scattering , @xmath117 is the free - electron density , @xmath118 is the speed of light , @xmath119 is the helium mass fraction , @xmath120 is the baryon density at redshift @xmath2 and the factor 1.08 approximately accounts for the contribution of the hei reionization , assuming that the hii and heii fractions are equal and neglecting the effects of the heii to heiii phase transition .",
    "in this section we present and discuss the main results of the application of the previous model under the assumption that the structure formation history is starting from a primordial non - gaussian density field . the corresponding predictions will be compared to the reionization scenario obtained for the gaussian ` reference ' case .",
    "first of all , using the minimum collapsed mass at each cosmological epoch as derived from the @xmath47-@xmath88 relation proposed by @xcite , we can compute the total collapsed fractions for different kinds of sources , following eq.([eq:2b ] ) .",
    "the results are presented in fig.[fig:3a ] , where we show the collapsed fractions of ia and ib haloes for the local and the equilateral cases here considered and their redshift evolution compared to the predictions for the gaussian scenario .",
    "we can notice that for both the local and the equilateral models , positive values for @xmath0 produce an enhancement of the collapsed fraction at a fixed redshift , given the larger probability for high - mass haloes in the primordial distribution . when scale - dependent non - gaussianity is considered , this effect becomes higher as the power - law parameter @xmath8 decreases .",
    "the opposite trend is observed when negative @xmath0 values are assumed : in this case we obtain a reduction of the non - gaussian collapsed fraction , due to the smaller probability for high - mass haloes at high @xmath2 .",
    "the evolution of the collapsed fraction due to non - gaussianity strongly affects the amount of ionized igm at different cosmological epochs . as illustred in fig.[fig:3b ] , that shows the evolution of the filling factor both for local and equilateral models , a positive primordial non - gaussianity produces , if a scale - dependent @xmath0 parameter is assumed , an increase of the ionized igm density , that can become 5 times higher than that predicted in the gaussian case .",
    "the igm reionization results slower when negative values are considered , since the smaller collapsed fraction produces a mild evolution of the filling factor , that is smaller compared to the gaussian case , at every cosmological epoch .",
    "finally in fig.[fig:4b ] we show the effects of the primordial non - gaussianity on the reionization optical depth @xmath121 assuming both local and equilateral models . as a consequence of the evolution of the ionized fraction , in the initial phases of reionization the values of @xmath121 for the models with positive @xmath0 are higher than those predicted for the gaussian case .",
    "in particular , when a scale - dependent non - gaussianity is assumed , the change in @xmath121 is higher than 10 per cent for @xmath122 . in this case",
    ", the non - gaussian optical depth would be @xmath123 at @xmath124 , that is still consistent with the last wmap observations ( @xmath125 ) . assuming a local shape with largest positive @xmath0 here considered we find @xmath126 .",
    "notice that for the gaussian model we predict a reionization optical depth at @xmath127 @xmath128 .",
    "we notice that our results are in qualitative agreement with the reionisation picture resulting from the analysis performed by @xcite .",
    "however , a direct comparison can not be done because of the differences in the considered cosmological parameters : in particular they assume the ones suggested by the first - year wmap analysis , with a significantly higher power spectrum normalization ( @xmath129 ) .",
    "furthermore , they parametrize the degree of non - gaussianity using the expectation value of the considered modified poisson distribution @xmath14 , that is inversely proportional to the @xmath0 parameter here used : @xmath130 .",
    "their results show that a high amount of primordial non - gaussianity ( small @xmath14 , i.e. high @xmath0 ) produces large deviations with respect to the gaussian case in the ionized fraction and the igm optical depth , in agreement with our results .",
    "we should , however , notice that for the gaussian reference model the estimate of @xmath121 in @xcite differs by 20 per cent with respect the value we predict using the 5-year wmap cosmology .        the predicted reionization optical depth ( at @xmath127 ) as a function of the non - gaussianity parameter @xmath0",
    "is shown in fig.[fig:6b ] for the local and equilateral cases .",
    "indeed , the standard deviation on the current estimate of @xmath121 from the last wmap results ( @xmath131 per cent ) does not allow us to strictly constrain the scale dependence of non - gaussianity and , as shown by @xcite , should affect the @xmath0 value by a @xmath132 per cent and @xmath133 per cent uncertainty for the local and equilateral shapes , respectively .",
    "we estimate that in order to distinguish among the different scale dependences , a precision between @xmath134 per cent ( @xmath74 ) and @xmath135 per cent ( @xmath68 ) on the @xmath121 measurement is required , using cmb - like experiments . in this sense",
    ", the smaller standard deviations expected by planck ( @xmath136 per cent ) @xcite could better probe the reionization optical depth and would possibly constrain the non - gaussianity parameter with an uncertainty of @xmath134 per cent and @xmath137 per cent in the local and equilaterals models , respectively .",
    "we should however keep in mind that the current wmap estimate of @xmath121 cited in this paper is affected by cosmic variance , since it is based on the bispectrum of the cosmic microwave background .",
    "recent works investigate alternative methods to avoid this problem ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .        as a general warning",
    ", we stress that the description of the recombination process in the analytic model here adopted relies on some simplifying assumptions which can affect the way in which reionization occurs . a deeper investigation of the igm statistical distribution would require the analysis of suitable numerical simulations having non - gaussian initial conditions .",
    "as an example of possible biases introduced by the model uncertainties , in fig.[fig:5b ] we show how a time - evolving clumping factor impacts the reionization optical depth .",
    "the results have been obtained by setting @xmath138 in eq.([eq:2c ] ) , as suggested by @xcite , for which the reionization optical depth is in agreement with the 3-year wmap results for many degrees of non - gaussianity .    in order to estimate the relative importance of the details of the analytic modelling of the reionization process here adopted , we can compare the igm optical depths predicted assuming @xmath99 ( fig.[fig:4b ] ) and @xmath138 ( fig.[fig:5b ] ) .",
    "as shown by the corresponding left panels , for the gaussian model the effect on @xmath121 due to the change in @xmath98 and then to the unknown igm physics is approximately of 10 per cent .",
    "viceversa , considering the non - gaussian to gaussian ratios ( shown in the right panels of figs.[fig:4b ] and [ fig:5b ] ) , changing @xmath98 from 0 to 2 produces negligible effects on the results .",
    "in fact we find that at high @xmath2 the ratios obtained with @xmath99 and @xmath138 differ by less than 1 per cent for the mildly non - gaussian models and by @xmath139 per cent for the non - gaussian models with the most extreme scale - dependence ( @xmath45 ) . by looking at the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:5b ] , we notice that for this last model the effect of introducing a primordial non - gaussianity can rise up to 10 per cent .",
    "this shows that the non - gaussian to gaussian ratios are only mildly affected by the choice of the recombination model : this justifies the fact that in this paper we preferred to show most of the results in terms of ratios in spite of absolute values .",
    "finally , we remark that our approach , which is based on the ps74 formalism and its extensions , can not fully account for the source clustering , that could indeed have relevant effects on the morphology of the hii regions . since the source distribution depends on the clustering amplitude through the bias parameter , that is different if a primordial non - gaussianity is considered ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we expect that our results could be affected by this approximation , which can be improved only with suitable numerical simulations .",
    "the aim of this work was to investigate how primordial non - gaussianity may alter the reionization history when compared to the standard scenario based on gaussian statistics .",
    "we have chosen a simple analytic method to describe the physical processes acting on the igm to make predictions on the evolution of the ionized fraction and the reionization optical depth .",
    "our work extends previous analyses @xcite based on simplified ways to introduce primordial non - gaussianity , considering models motivated by inflation .",
    "in particular we assume two different hierarchical evolution scenarios for the ionizing sources , characterized by scale - independent and scale - dependent non - gaussianity .",
    "all scenarios here considered are not violating the constraints coming from the recent analysis of the 5-year wmap data .",
    "our main conclusions can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "non - gaussianity affects the abundance of the dark matter haloes , since the formation of high - mass collapsed objects is enhanced ( reduced ) when positive ( negative ) values for the @xmath0 parameter are assumed .",
    "this effect is more evident at earlier cosmological epochs , exactly when reionization begins .",
    "2 .   as a consequence , for positive primordial non - gaussianity",
    ", the collapsed fraction in type ia and ib sources is higher than for the gaussian case at the same epoch , and the difference increases with @xmath2 .",
    "the opposite result applies when @xmath74 is assumed .",
    "the igm filling factor is higher and its evolution is faster than in the gaussian scenario if a positive @xmath0 is assumed .",
    "this effect is enhanced for a scale - dependent non - gaussianity , that can produce a 5 times higher @xmath140 with respect to the gaussian case , at early cosmological epochs .",
    "viceversa the filling factor is smaller and has a mild redshift evolution for negative @xmath0 .",

    "we finally remark that our predictions of the reionization optical depth in non - gaussian cosmologies are in agreement with that estimated by 5-year wmap analysis within @xmath141 error bars and a precision higher than that of wmap is required to constrain non - gaussianity and its scale dependence .",
    "ideally one would simulate reionization in non - gaussian cosmological models using hydrodynamical simulations that incorporate all the relevant physical processes in a consistent framework ( most importantly radiative transfer effects in the igm ) . however , such approach is very time consuming due to the large box size and the high resolution required to simulate large volumes and , at the same time , the physics of the sources of radiation .",
    "for this reason , some approximate semi - analytic schemes such as the one presentend here are still useful especially when calibrated on the more robust results of the hydrodynamical runs .",
