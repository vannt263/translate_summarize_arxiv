    "one of the most important aspects of biological systems is their capacity to learn and memorize patterns and to adapt themselves to exogenous and endogenous stimuli by tuning signal transduction pathways activity . the mechanistic description of this behavior is typically depicted as a `` switch '' that can drive the cell fate to different stable states characterized by some observables such as levels of proteins , messengers , organelles or phenotypes @xcite . the biochemical machinery of signal transduction pathways is largely based on enzymatic reactions , whose average kinetic can be described within the framework of chemical kinetics and enzyme reactions as pioneered by michaelis and menten @xcite .",
    "the steady state velocity equation accounts for the majority of known enzymatic reactions , and can be adjusted to the description of regulatory properties such as cooperativity , allostericity and activation / inhibition@xcite .",
    "theoretical interest in enzymatic reactions has never stopped since michaelis - menten s work and has lead to new discoveries such as zero - order ultrasensitivity @xcite . among various enzymatic processes ,",
    "a wide and important class comprises the reversible addition and removal of phosphoric groups via phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions catalyzed by kinases and phosphatases .",
    "the phospho / dephosphorylation cycle ( pdpc ) is a reversible post - translational substrate modification that is central to cellular signalling regulation and can play a key role in the switch phenomenon for several biological processes ( @xcite ) .",
    "dual pdpc s are classified as homogeneous and heterogeneous based on the number of different kinases and phosphatases ( @xcite ) ; the homogeneous has one kinase and one phosphatase , while the heterogeneous has two kinases and two phosphatases .",
    "variants of homogeneous and heterogeneous dual pdpc s may only have a non - specific phosphatase and two specific kinases @xcite or , symmetrically , a non - specific kinase and two specific phosphatases .",
    "the pdpc with the non - specific phosphatase controls the phosphorylation state of ampa receptors that mediates induction of long term potentiation ( ltp ) and long term depression ( ltd ) in vitro and in vivo@xcite .",
    "recently , several authors have reported bistability in homogeneus ppdpc @xcite ) as well as those with a non - specific phosphatase and two different kinases @xcite .",
    "the bistable behaviour of the homogeneous system is explained on the basis of a competition between the substrates for the enzymes .",
    "the majority of studies on biophysical analysis of phospho / dephosphorylation cycle have been performed in a averaged , deterministic framework based on michaelis - menten ( mm ) approach , using the steady state approximation .",
    "however , recently some authors @xcite have pointed to the role of fluctuations in the dynamics of biochemical reactions . indeed , in a single cell",
    ", the concentration of molecules ( substrates and enzymes ) can be low , and thus it is necessary to study the pdpc cycle within a stochastic framework . a `` natural '' way to cope with this problem",
    "is the so - called chemical master equation ( cme ) approach @xcite , that realizes in an exact way the probabilistic dynamics of a finite number of molecules , and recovers the chemical kinetics of the law of mass action , which yields the continuous michaelis - menten equation in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath0 , ) using the mean field approximation . in this paper",
    "we study a stochastic formulation of enzymatic cycles that has been extensively considered by several authors ( @xcite ) .",
    "the deterministic descriptions of these models characterize the stability of fixed points and give a geometrical interpretation of the observed steady states , as the intersection of conic curves(@xcite ) .",
    "the stochastic description can in fact provide further information on the relative stability of the different steady states in terms of a stationary distribution .",
    "we propose a perturbative approach for computing the stationary solution out of the thermodynamics equilibrium .",
    "we also point out the role of currents in the transition from a mono - modal distribution to a bimodal distribution ; this corresponds to bifurcation in the deterministic approach .",
    "the possibility that chemical fluxes control the distribution shape suggests a generic mechanism used by biochemical systems out of thermodynamic equilibrium to obtain a plastic behavior .",
    "moreover , we show that at the bimodal transition there exists a diffusion region in the configuration space where a fokker - planck equation can be introduced to approximate the stationary solution .",
    "analogous models have been previously studied @xcite for single - step pdpc .",
    "the process shown in fig . ( [ double_cycle_gen ] ) is a two - step chain of addition / removal reactions of chemical groups and may , in general , model important biological processes such as phenotype switching ( ultrasensitivity ) and chromatine modification by histone acetylation / deacetylation as well as phospho / dephosphorylation reactions . without loss of generality , we perform a detailed study of the homogeneous phospho / dephosphorylation two - step cycles ( pdpc cycles ) where two enzymes drive phosphorylation and dephosphorylation respectively .",

    "the biochemical meaning is that the enzyme quantities should scale as the total number of molecule @xmath15 , to have a finite thermodynamic limit @xmath17 , in the transition rates ( [ twoenz ] ) .",
    "as it is known from the theory of one - step markov processes , the cme ( [ markov1s ] ) has a unique stationary solution @xmath18 that describes the statistical properties of the system on a long time scale .",

    "however , when a phase transition occurs due to the bifurcation of the stable solution , fluctuations are relevant even for large @xmath15 and the cme approach is necessary . in the next section",
    "we discuss the stationary distribution properties for the cme ( [ markov1s ] ) .",
    "the stationary solution @xmath18 of the cme ( [ markov1s ] ) can be characterized by a discrete version of the zero divergence condition for the current vector @xmath21 components(see appendix ) @xmath22 and the cme r.h.s .",

    "the net transport across any closed path is zero and we have no current source in the network . as discussed in @xcite",
    "we distinguish two cases : when the potential @xmath25 is constant ( the so called  detailed balance condition \" ) and the converse case corresponding to a non - equilibrium stationary state . in this case the stationary solution @xmath30 is characterized by the condition @xmath31 over all the states , whereas in the other case we have macroscopic chemical fluxes in the system .",
    "when detailed balance holds , simple algebraic manipulations ( see appendix ) result in the following conditions for the stationary solutions @xmath32 where the discrete drift vector field components @xmath33 are defined by : @xmath34 equations ( 9 ) and ( [ det_bal_staz ] ) imply the existence of a potential @xmath35 such that @xmath36         using definition ( [ twoenz ] ) it is possible to explicitly compute a set of parameter values for the pdpc cycle , that satisfy the detailed balance condition ( [ det_bal2 ] ) according to the relations @xmath37 where the reaction velocities @xmath38 are arbitrary .",
    "the stationary distribution is given by the maxwell - boltzmann distribution @xmath39 where the potential @xmath35 is computed by integrating equation ( [ det_bal2 ] ) and choosing the initial value @xmath40 to normalize the distribution ( [ max_boltz ] ) .",
    "using a thermodynamical analogy , we can interpret the potential difference @xmath41 as the chemical energy needed to reach the state @xmath28 from the initial state @xmath42 . as a consequence , the vector field ( [ field ] ) represents the work for one - step transition along the @xmath7 or @xmath8 direction .",
    "definition ( [ max_boltz ] ) also implies that the critical points of the stationary distribution are characterized by the conditions @xmath43 and coincides with the critical points of the mm equations . in figure [ detbal_fig ]",
    "we plot the stationary distributions ( [ max_boltz ] ) in the case @xmath44 with @xmath45 and @xmath46 ; we consider two symmetric cases : @xmath47 with @xmath48 or @xmath49 ( all the units are arbitrary ) . in the first case ,",
    "the probability distribution is unimodal , whereas in the second case the transition to a bimodal distribution is observed .",

    ", the dynamics of transient states may depend critically on finite size effects not described by using the fokker - planck approximation@xcite . to cope with these problems in the pdpc model further studies are necessary .    when the current ( [ rotore ] ) is not zero the cme ( [ markov1s ] ) relaxes toward a non - equilibrium stationary state ( ness ) and the field ( [ field ] ) is not conservative .",
    "we shall perform a perturbative approach to point out the effects of currents on the ness nearby the transition region to the bimodal regime .",
    "we consider the following decomposition for the vector field @xmath53 where the rotor potential @xmath54 takes into account the irreversible rotational part .",
    "the potential @xmath54 can be recursively computed using the discrete laplace equation @xmath55 where @xmath56 , with the boundary conditions @xmath57 ( see appendix ) .",
    "assuming that the potential @xmath58 is small with respect to @xmath59 , we can approximate the ness by using the maxwell - boltzmann distribution ( [ max_boltz ] ) with @xmath60 .",
    "however , as we shall show in the next section , at the phase transition even the effect of small currents becomes critical , and the study of higher perturbative orders is necessary . to point out the relation among the rotor potential @xmath58 , the ness @xmath30 and the chemical flux @xmath61 , we compute the first perturbative order letting @xmath62 . from definition ( [ current ] ) the condition ( 8) reads : @xmath63    @xmath64 turns out to be an effective potential that simulates the current s effect on the unperturbed stationary distribution by using a conservative force .",
    "we note that if the rotor potential @xmath58 is zero , then both the current potential @xmath2 and the potential correction @xmath65 are zero , so that all these quantities are of the same perturbative order , and the first perturbative order of eqs .",
    "( [ current_nq ] ) reads @xmath66 from the previous equations we see that the currents depend both on the rotor potential @xmath58 and the potential correction @xmath65 , which is unknown ; thus they can not be directly computed from ( [ current_nq1 ] ) .",

    "it is interesting to analyze equation ( [ pot_pert ] ) in the phase transition regime .",
    "when the recombination terms @xmath72,@xmath73 are almost equal and their variation is small ( for our parameter choice this is true for @xmath74 and @xmath75 ) the r.h.s . can be approximated by @xmath76\\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as a consequence , in the transition regime this term is negligible since both @xmath77 and @xmath78 tend toward zero in the diffusion region where the bifurcation occurs ; thus the first perturbative order is not enough to compute the stationary distribution correction , but higher orders should be considered .",
    "in order to study the non equilibrium stationary conditions in the double phosphorylation cycle ( [ double_cycle_eq_two_enz ] ) we have perturbed the detailed balance conditions considered in figure ( [ detbal_fig ] ) by changing the value of the mm constants @xmath79 and @xmath80 . in figure ( [ rot_fig ] )",
    "we show the rotor field of the potential @xmath58 in the cases @xmath81 and @xmath82 when the detailed balance condition ( [ det_bal_cond ] ) does not hold .",
    "we see that in the first case ( left picture ) the rotor field tends to move the particles from the borders toward the central region @xmath83 , so that we expect an increase of the probability distribution in the center , whereas in the second case the rotor field is directed from the central region to the borders and we expect a decrease of the probability distribution in this region . to illustrate the effect of the potential @xmath58 , we compare the zero - order approximation of the probability distribution ( [ max_boltz ] ) , where the potential @xmath84 is computed using decomposition ( [ field_nc ] ) with the stationary solution of the cme ( [ markov1s ] ) .",

    "for the first parameter set , the zero - order approximation is a bimodal distribution , but the effect of the currents induced by the rotor potential @xmath58 ( see fig .",
    "[ rot_fig ] ) left ) are able to destroy the bimodal behaviour by depressing the two maximal at the border ( see fig .",
    "if we increase the value of the @xmath87 and @xmath88 ( case ii ) , the exact stationary distribution becomes bimodal and the effect of currents is to introduce a strong transition probability between the two distribution maxima ( fig .",
    "[ dist02_fig ] ) .    therefore , when the mm constants @xmath89 and @xmath90 are @xmath91 ( we note that for @xmath46 , the detailed balance holds ) , the non - conservative nature of the field ( [ field_nc ] ) introduces a delay in the phase transition from a mono - modal to a bimodal distribution . however , when we consider @xmath92 ( cases iii and iv ) the rotor potential @xmath58 moves the particle towards the borders and the central part of the distribution is depressed .",
    "this is shown in the figure [ dist03_fig ] where we compare the zero - order approximation of the stationary distribution and the solution of the cme using the case iii parameters of the table [ table1 ] .",
    "finally , in case iv of table [ table1 ] , the cme stationary solution undergoes a transition to a bimodal distribution , whereas the zero - order approximation is still mono - modal ( fig .",

    "the distribution is bimodal ( cfr .",
    "figure 8) and the current lines tend to be orthogonal to the distribution gradient near the maximal value.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]        using the stationary solution one can also compute the currents according to definition ( [ current ] ) . in figure ( 9 ) we plot the current vector in case iv parameters to show that the current tends to become normal to the distribution gradient near the maximal value .",
    "this result can be also understood using the perturbative approach ( [ pot_pert ] ) , where one shows that the main effect of the @xmath65 potential correction is to compensate the rotor field of @xmath58 along the distribution gradient directions . as a consequence ,",
    "the current is zero at the maximal distribution value and condition ( [ crit_point ] ) defines the critical points of the stationary distribution even in the non - conservative case .",
    "the cme approach we present here is a powerful method for studying complex cellular processes , even with significant simplifications such as spatial homogeneity of volumes where the chemical reactions are taking place .",
    "the cme theory is attractive for a variety of reasons , including the richness of aspects ( the capability of coping with fluctuations and chemical fluxes ) and the possibility of developing thermodynamics , starting from the distribution function .",
    "the violation of detailed balance gives information on the `` openness '' of the system and on the nature of the bistable regimes , which are induced by the external environment ; in contrast , it is a free - energy equilibrium when detailed balance holds .",
    "this statement can be expressed in a more rigorous form by introducing the vector field generated from the ratio between the generation and recombination terms , by decomposing it into a sum of `` conservative '' and `` rotational '' fields ( helmholtz decomposition ) and by relating the chemical fluxes to the non - conservative field . the magnitude of deviations from detailed balance influences the form of the stationary distribution at the transition to a bistable regime , which may be driven by the currents .",
    "an interesting test for the prediction of the pdpc cme model would be to perform one experiment with the parameter values chosen to satisfy db and compare it with another set of parameters where db is not fulfilled .",
    "our results show that the pdpc can operate across these two regions , and that the transition regime can be explained by the role of the currents , that , within a thermodynamic framework , can be interpreted as the effect of an external energy source .",
    "a full thermodynamic analysis of this cycle is beyond the scope of this paper , but we can surmise that this approach might be extended to other cycles in order to quantify if , and how much energy , is required to maintain or create bistability . another way to extend this analysis would be the generalization to @xmath93-step phospho / dephosphorylation cycles , where the stationary distribution will be the product of @xmath93 independent one - dimensional distributions . in conclusion , our results could be important for a deeper characterization of biochemical signaling cycles that are the molecular basis for complex cellular behaviors implemented as a `` switch '' between states .",

    "<S> dual phospho / dephosphorylation cycles , as well as covalent enzymatic - catalyzed modifications of substrates are widely diffused within cellular systems and are crucial for the control of complex responses such as learning , memory and cellular fate determination . despite the large body of deterministic studies and the increasing work aimed at elucidating the effect of noise in such systems , some aspects remain unclear . here </S>",
    "<S> we study the stationary distribution provided by the two - dimensional chemical master equation for a well - known model of a two step phospho / dephosphorylation cycle using the quasi - steady state approximation of enzymatic kinetics . </S>",
    "<S> our aim is to analyze the role of fluctuations and the molecules distribution properties in the transition to a bistable regime . when detailed balance conditions are satisfied it is possible to compute equilibrium distributions in a closed and explicit form . </S>",
    "<S> when detailed balance is not satisfied , the stationary non - equilibrium state is strongly influenced by the chemical fluxes . in the last case , </S>",
    "<S> we show how the external field derived from the generation and recombination transition rates , can be decomposed by the helmholtz theorem , into a conservative and a rotational ( irreversible ) part . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , this decomposition , allows to compute the stationary distribution via a perturbative approach . for a finite number of molecules there </S>",
    "<S> exists diffusion dynamics in a macroscopic region of the state space where a relevant transition rate between the two critical points is observed . </S>",
    "<S> further , the stationary distribution function can be approximated by the solution of a fokker - planck equation . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate the theoretical results using several numerical simulations . </S>"
