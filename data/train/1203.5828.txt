    "in the past 20 years or so , impressive progress has been made in characterising the evolution of galaxy physical properties over a large fraction of cosmic time .",
    "a consistent picture , at least crudely , has emerged in which the global stellar mass density decreases by a factor of 2 or so from @xmath2 to 2 and the comoving cosmic star - formation rate ( sfr ) density increases by more than a factor of 10 over the past 8 gyr , peaks around @xmath4 to 3 and then declines almost linearly with time to higher redshift ( e.g. , lilly et al . 1996 ; madau et al .",

    "the key question that dominates both observational and theoretical efforts today is what physical processes play the dominant role in driving the evolution of the cosmic star - formation activity .",
    "processes such as a decline in the major - merger rate , reduced gas accretion in halos , feedback from central massive black holes and supernova , and environmental effects ( ram pressure stripping of gas , strangulation of the extended halo , etc . )",
    "can all impact on the star - formation activity ( e.g. , kere et al . 2005 , 2009 ; bell et al .",

    "; croton et al . 2006 ; somerville et al . 2008 ; lotz et al . 2008 ) .",
    "since galaxies form in dark matter halos and their evolution is influenced by the accretion and successive merging of halos ( white & rees 1978 ; fall & efstathiou 1980 ; blumenthal et al .",
    "1984 ) , it is reasonable to assume that the physical properties of galaxies should correlate to those of the host halos ( such as the mass of the halo ) .",
    "observationally , finding the mass of the host halo can be achieved in a number of ways , e.g. , weak gravitational lensing ( mckay et al . 2001 ; hoekstra et al . 2004 ; sheldon et al . 2004 ; mandelbaum et al . 2006 ; sheldon et al .",
    "2009 ) , dynamical measurement of satellite galaxies ( mckay et al . 2002 ; van den bosch et al . 2004 ; conroy et al . 2007 ; more et al . 2011 ) and x - ray studies ( lin et al . 2003 ; lin & mohr 2004 ; vikhlinin et al .",
    "these techniques are at present expensive in terms of observing time and limited to low @xmath8 and small dynamical range in halo mass .",
    "alternatively , the halo model provides a simple but powerful way to statistically link galaxies with halos . in its simplest form , the halo occupation distribution ( hod ) , which gives the probability of finding @xmath9 galaxies ( with some specified properties ) in a halo of mass @xmath0 is used to interpret galaxy clustering ( e.g. , peacock & smith 2000 ; seljak 2000 ; scoccimarro et al .2001 ; berlind & weinberg 2002 ; zehavi et al .",
    "modifications of the hod include the conditional luminosity function ( clf ) which encodes the number of galaxies as a function of luminosity in a given halo ( yang et al .",
    "2003 ; van den bosch et al . 2003 ; vale & ostriker 2004 ) and the conditional stellar mass function ( csmf ) which encodes the number of galaxies as a function of stellar mass in a given halo ( yang et al . 2009 ; moster et al . 2010 ; behroozi et al .",
    "2010 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we build an extended halo model ( ehm ) to connect stellar mass , @xmath10 , and sfr , @xmath11 , with the host halo mass , @xmath0 .",
    "the ehm is a hybrid model composed of a parametrised @xmath10 - @xmath0 relation and a non - parametric @xmath10 - @xmath11 relation .",
    "the first part of the ehm is to use a parametrised relation between the distribution of stellar mass and halo mass , i.e. the csmf , to describe the statistical relation between @xmath10 and @xmath0 .",
    "the parameters in the csmf at @xmath2 are tuned by the spatial density and clustering of galaxies while their evolution in the redshift range @xmath1 is constrained by galaxy smfs only .",
    "the second part of the ehm is to extend the csmf to the joint distribution in @xmath10 and @xmath11 as a function of @xmath0 , using two different scenarios for the role of @xmath0 in determining the distribution of @xmath11 at fixed @xmath10 .",
    "this second part is non - parametric as we use the observed conditional sfr distributions at fixed @xmath10 as direct inputs .",
    "the key to building the ehm is a large sample of galaxies with reliable @xmath10 and @xmath11 estimates .",
    "the herschel multi - tiered extragalactic survey ( hermes ; oliver et al .",
    "2011 ) covering most of the well - studied extragalactic fields with ancillary data from the x - ray to radio is the perfect place to start such a project .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in section 2 , first we briefly describe the published measurements used to constrain the ehm .",
    "then , we describe the data - sets used to derive the stellar masses and sfrs of high - redshift galaxies in hermes fields . in section 3",
    ", we present the csmf in both the local universe and at high redshift .",
    "the evolution of the stellar content as a function of @xmath0 is derived using the csmf as a function of redshift and the halo accretion history from n - body simulations . in section 4 , we extend the csmf to the 2-d distribution of galaxies in the @xmath12 plane as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "the evolution of the star - formation activity as a function of @xmath0 is derived using the ehm as a function of redshift and the halo accretion history .",

    "all magnitudes are in the ab system .",
    "to constrain the @xmath10 - @xmath0 relation at @xmath2 , we use the published stellar mass function ( smf ) ( guo et al . 2010 ) and correlation functions of the sdss galaxies ( li et al .",
    "2006 ) . to constrain the redshift evolution of the @xmath10 - @xmath0 relation , we use the published smfs in prez - gonzlez et al . ( 2008 )",
