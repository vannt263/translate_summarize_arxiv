    "the invariant yields in different @xmath17 bins are obtained by correcting the measured signal for geometrical acceptance and occupancy @xcite . each @xmath17 spectrum",

    "the nuclear modification factor shows distinctive behavior for pions ( mesons ) and protons ( baryons ) @xcite .",
    "pions are suppressed , as expected from jet - quenching in the dense medium produced in the collisions , while ( anti)proton production shows scaling typical for point - like processes in the absence of medium modifications . these seemingly contradictory results point to different dominant production mechanisms of pions and protons at moderately high @xmath30 .",
