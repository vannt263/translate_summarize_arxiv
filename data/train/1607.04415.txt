    "quasars comprise the most luminous class of non - transient objects in the universe .",
    "characterizing their population and evolution is the critical tool to constrain directly the formation and evolution of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) across cosmic time .",
    "the fundamental way to characterize these objects is through the evolution of their number density with luminosity and redshift , namely the quasar luminosity function ( qlf ) .",
    "the qlf and its cosmological evolution have been a key focus of quasar studies for half a century . @xcite",
    "first determined the evolution of the quasar population and found the first evidence for a significant increase of the quasar number density with redshift in both radio and optical bands .",
    "more recently , based on measurements of the qlf from several successful surveys , such as the 2df quasar redshift survey @xcite , combo-17 @xcite , the 2df - sdss lrg and qso survey ( 2slaq ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the sdss faint quasar survey @xcite , the vimos - vlt deep survey ( vvds ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , sdss and 2slaq @xcite and boss dr9 @xcite , the qlf , especially in optical bands , has been well characterized at low to intermediate redshifts .",
    "the qlf can be parameterized with a double power law shape and pure luminosity evolution for quasars at redshifts up to @xmath10 = 2 @xcite . the bright end slope at low redshift , the effect of @xmath11cosmic downsizing@xmath11 and the density peak of quasars at 2 @xmath12 3 @xcite have been confirmed by many subsequent investigations .",
    "the measurements based on large samples from boss yield a qlf evolution best fit by a luminosity evolution and density evolution ( lede ) model at 2 @xmath12 3.5 @xcite . in their work , the bright end slope does not evolve with redshift and is different from the result of @xcite , which suggested a flatter bright end slope at high redshift than that at low redshift . to better determine the evolution of qlf parameters , a wider redshift range is needed .    towards higher redshift ,",
    "quasars are important tracers of the structure and evolution of the early universe , the evolution of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , the growth of smbhs and co - evolution of smbhs and host galaxies at early epochs .",
    "observations of the gunn - peterson effect using absorption spectra of quasars at @xmath13 5.7 have established @xmath1 6 as the end of cosmic reionization , when the igm is rapidly transforming from largely neutral to completely ionized @xcite .",
    "@xcite find evidence for uv background fluctuations at @xmath14 5.7 in excess of predictions from a single mean - free - path model , which indicates that reionization is not fully complete at that redshift .",
    "@xcite suggest that reionization is just completing at @xmath14 6 , possibly with a tail to @xmath14 5.5 .",
    "therefore , in the post - reionization epoch , the qlf at @xmath15 is needed to estimate the contribution of quasars to the ionizing background during and after the reionization epoch . although quasars are not likely to be the dominant source of ionizing photons @xcite , their exact contribution is still highly uncertain .",
    "in addition , @xmath16 quasar absorption spectra can be used to constrain the physical conditions of the igm in this key redshift range , and provide the basic boundary conditions for models of reionization , such as the evolution of igm temperature , photon mean free path , metallicity and the impact of helium reionization @xcite .    however , high redshift quasars are very rare , especially at @xmath17 5 .",
    "although more than 300,000 quasars are known , only @xmath18200 of them are at @xmath17 5 . therefore , qlf measurements at high redshift still have large uncertainties . from the combination of sdss dr7 quasars and the stripe 82 ( s82 ) faint quasar sample , @xcite provided the most complete measurement of the @xmath15 qlf so far , especially at the faint end . a factor of 2 greater decrease in the number density of luminous quasars from @xmath10 = 5 to 6 than that from @xmath10 = 4 to 5 was claimed (",
    "* hereafter m13 ) .",
    "however , their work focused on the faint end ; there are only 8 quasars with @xmath19 in the sample .",
    "a survey described in this series of papers aims at finding more luminous quasars at 4.7 @xmath12 5.5 , which allows a better determination of the bright end qlf and a better constraint on the quasar evolution model at high redshift .",
    "* hereafter paper i ) presented a new selection using sdss and the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) optical / nir colors . in this followup paper , we report our measurement of the bright end @xmath1 5 qlf using the quasar sample selected by the method presented in paper i. the outline of our paper is as follows . in section 2 , we briefly review the quasar candidate selection and the spectroscopic observations of these candidates .",
    "the survey completeness will be presented in section 3 . in this section",
    ", we use a quasar color model ( m13 ) to quantify our selection completeness and to correct the incompleteness due to the allwise detection flux limit and spectral coverage .",
    "we then calculate the binned luminosity function and fit our data using a maximum likelihood estimator in section 4 .",
    "we also study the evolution of the qlf and compare our results with previous work in this section . in section 5",
    ", we discuss the contribution of @xmath1 5 quasars to the ionizing background and the radio loud fraction of our quasar sample .",
    "we summarize our main results in section 6 . in this paper",
    ", we adopt a @xmath20cdm cosmology with parameters @xmath21 = 0.728 , @xmath22 = 0.272 , @xmath23 = 0.0456 , and h@xmath24 = 70 @xmath25 @xcite for direct comparison with the result in m13 .",
    "photometric data from the sdss are in the sdss photometric system @xcite , which is almost identical to the ab system at bright magnitudes ; photometric data from allwise are in the vega system .",
    "all sdss data shown in this paper are corrected for galactic extinction .",
    "our sdss+wise selection technique and spectroscopic follow - up observations were discussed in detail in paper i. here we briefly review the basic steps . at @xmath1 5 ,",
    "most quasars are undetectable in @xmath26-band and @xmath27-band because of the presence of strong lyman limit systems ( llss ) , which are optically thick to the uv continuum radiation from quasars @xcite .",
    "the ly@xmath28 absorption systems also begin to dominate in the @xmath29-band and ly@xmath28 emission moves to the @xmath30-band .",
    "therefore , the @xmath31/@xmath32 color - color diagram was often used to select @xmath1 5 quasar candidates in previous studies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , with increasing redshift , the @xmath32 color also becomes increasingly red and most @xmath17 5.1 quasars enter the m star locus in the @xmath31/@xmath32 color - color diagram , which makes it difficult to find @xmath17 5.1 quasars with only the optical colors .",
    "therefore , we added near - infrared colors from wise photometry data in our selection .",
    "we used typical @xmath26 , @xmath27 drop - out methods but more relaxed @xmath31/@xmath32 cuts to select candidates from the sdss dr10 database .",
    "then we cross - matched our candidates with the allwise database using a @xmath33 match radius and used @xmath10-w1/w1-w2 cuts to remove more star contaminations by the following criteria .",
    "the exact selection criteria are given in paper i. @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37    we constructed our main luminous quasar candidate sample by limiting the sdss @xmath10 band magnitudes to brighter than 19.5 , and selected a total of 420 luminous @xmath1 5 quasar candidates .",
    "we removed 78 known quasars , one known dwarf and 231 candidates with suspicious detections , such as multiple peaked objects or being affected by bright star artifacts .",
    "we visually inspected images of each candidate and removed those 231 candidates .",
    "we selected 110 candidates with high image quality as our main candidate sample .",
    "our spectroscopic follow - up campaign started in october 2013 .",
    "we observed 99 candidates from our main sample with the lijiang 2.4 m telescope ( ljt ) and xinglong 2.16 m telescope in china , the kitt peak 2.3 m bok telescope and 6.5 m mmt telescope in the u.s . , as well as the 2.3 m anu telescope in australia .",
    "64 ( 64.6% ) candidates have been identified as high - redshift quasars in the redshift range @xmath38 . as discussed in paper i ,",
    "due to the serious contamination from m - type stars , there is a gap in the previously published quasar redshift distribution at 5.2 @xmath12 5.7 with only 33 published quasars ins this redshift range . among our 64 newly identified quasars from main candidates",
    "sample , 9 quasars are at 5.2 @xmath12 5.7 , which represents an increase of 27% in the number of known quasars in this redshift range .",
    "the details of spectroscopic observation and data reduction are also given in paper i.      the redshifts of newly identified quasars are measured from @xmath39 , nv , oi / siii , cii , siiv and civ emission lines ( any available ) by an eye - recognition assistant for quasar spectra software ( asera ; * ? ? ?",
    "the typical redshift error is about 0.05 for ly@xmath28-based redshift measurement and will be less for that based on more emission lines .",
    "we calculate @xmath40 in the ab system by fitting a power - law continuum @xmath41 to the spectrum for each quasar .",
    "we assume an average quasar uv continuum slope of @xmath42 @xcite ( see details in paper i ) .",
    "our 64 new quasars from the luminous quasar candidate sample are within the absolute magnitude range @xmath43 .",
    "we calculate @xmath40 for previous known quasars using the same method .",
    "the known quasars are from the sdss dr7 and dr12 quasar catalogs ( * ? ? ?",
    "* pris et al . in prep ) , @xcite and @xcite . when we removed the known quasars from our quasar candidate sample , we missed two known quasars .",
    "these two quasars from @xcite and @xcite were also spectroscopically observed by us , and thus we use our new spectra to do the @xmath40 calculation .    for the qlf determination , we define our sample of @xmath14 5 luminous quasars as follows :    * quasars in the redshift range 4.7 @xmath44 5.4 . our selection criteria yield low completeness at redshifts lower than 4.7 or higher than 5.4 .",
    "the former is caused by the drop of w1-w2 color ( see fig . 3 in paper i ) , and the latter is caused by our @xmath45 limit .",
    "therefore , we restrict our sample to the range 4.7 @xmath44 5.4 ( see details in section 3.2 ) .",
    "* quasars in the luminosity range @xmath46 .",
    "our selection criteria yield a low completeness in the region with @xmath17 5 and @xmath47 .",
    "the mean completeness in this region is @xmath18 4% . that is caused by our sdss magnitude limit of @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , we limit our sample to @xmath46 .",
    "* our selection covers the whole sdss footprint without masked regions , which is a 14555 square degree field .",
    "based on the criteria above , there are 45 newly identified quasars in the sample of paper i , and another 54 previously known quasars that satisfy our selection criteria .",
    "this is the final complete @xmath16 luminous quasar sample that we will use to determine the @xmath16 qlf .",
    "figure 1 shows the redshift and @xmath40 distributions of both our newly identified luminous quasars and known quasars .",
    "three of our new quasars are more luminous than any previously known quasars at @xmath17 5 .",
    "it is obvious that our discovery significantly expands the @xmath1 5 luminous quasar sample .",
    "table 1 lists all 99 quasars in our sample used for the qlf determination .",

    "traditionally , quasars have been divided into two populations , radio - loud and radio - quiet @xcite .",
    "the similarity and difference between the evolution of radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars are thought to be related to black hole mass , accretion and spin.@xcite .",

    "<S> this is the second paper in a series on a new luminous @xmath0 quasar survey using optical and near - infrared colors . here </S>",
    "<S> we present a new determination of the bright end of the quasar luminosity function ( qlf ) at @xmath1 5 . </S>",
    "<S> combined our 45 new quasars with previously known quasars that satisfy our selections , we construct the largest uniform luminous @xmath1 5 quasar sample to date , with 99 quasars in the range 4.7 @xmath2 5.4 and @xmath3 , within the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) footprint . </S>",
    "<S> we use a modified 1/v@xmath4 method including flux limit correction to derive a binned qlf , and we model the parametric qlf using maximum likelihood estimation . with the faint - end slope of the qlf fixed as @xmath5 from previous deeper samples , </S>",
    "<S> the best fit of our qlf gives a flatter bright end slope @xmath6 and a fainter break magnitude @xmath7 than previous studies at similar redshift . </S>",
    "<S> combined with previous work at lower and higher redshifts , our result is consistent with a luminosity evolution and density evolution ( lede ) model . using the best fit qlf , the contribution of quasars to the ionizing background at @xmath1 5 </S>",
    "<S> is found to be 18% @xmath8 45% with a clumping factor @xmath9 of 2 @xmath8 5 . </S>",
    "<S> our sample suggests an evolution of radio loud fraction with optical luminosity but no obvious evolution with redshift . </S>"
