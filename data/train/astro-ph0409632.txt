    "the ic 65 group of four late type galaxies ( ic 65 , ugc 608 , ugc 622 , and an `` edge - on '' galaxy - pgc 138291 ) has been studied by van moorsel ( 1983 ) in the 21 cm hi line with the wsrt .",
    "he noted : `` each of these four galaxies show asymmetric features in their hi distribution , especially ugc 622 .",
    "... the presence of hi asymmetries and the small dispersion in radial velocities makes it likely that all detected four galaxies are members of one group '' at the distance of @xmath6 mpc ( @xmath7 km / s / mpc is assumed ) .",
    "because of its unfavourable location close to the zone of avoidance ( @xmath8 ) this group was not registered in earlier catalogs of nearby groups , and has been registered as the lyon group of galaxies ( lgg ) 16 ( garcia 1993 ) .",
    "it fulfills selection criteria of the hickson compact groups .",
    "van moorsel ( 1983 ) detected one more hi - rich lsb anonymous ( a ) galaxy located @xmath9 to the ne of ic 65 ( a  0101 + 4744 in the fig .  1 )",
    ", having systemic velocity , which is close to the group mean .",
    "this encourages us to look for further dwarf companions in the area of this particular group .",
    "we carried out a systematic search for new lsb dwarf member candidates of this particular group by utilizing the digitized poss ii ( dss 2 ) blue and red frames , which were previously linearized and photometrically calibrated by us .",
    "the searched area was @xmath10 , i.e. 0.67 @xmath11 0.67 mpc at the distance of the group .",
    "the detection of objects was performed by means of running the sextractor software ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) in double - image mode on the blue and red dss 2 frames .",
    "galaxies were selected in the sextracted catalog by several steps using the stellarity index , diameters and surface brightness ( sb ) characteristics . in a crowded environment of the ic 65 group",
    "the automatic selection was insufficient .",
    "we needed to take the morphologies into account . in effect , the final list of 105 galaxies was selected , which is believed to be complete for objects with diameters @xmath12 at the 25.5 @xmath13 isophote .",
    "0.1 cm    ( 160,70 )    in order to disentangle the possible new dwarf members of the group from distant field galaxies , we applied two criteria : 1 ) the binggeli s ( 1994 ) empirical relation between the central sb and absolute magnitude , common both for de and dirr galaxies ( fig .",
    "2a ) , and 2 ) the empirical light concentration parameter , as proposed by trentham et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , versus sextracted colour index ( fig .",
    "2b ) . as a result",
    ", we have selected four lsb irregular galaxies , which show the lowest light concentration ( i.e. the largest scale lengths ) , the bluest color ( @xmath14 ) , and fit the empirical binggeli s relation for dwarf galaxies .",
    "there are 7 more galaxies with lsb morphologies , but all of them with @xmath15 . at fainter magnitudes and/or smaller diameters",
    "we actually lose the ability to distinguish possible group members from the background galaxies on sb grounds .",
    "+ table  1 lists the basic data for certain group members and for new selected anonymous ( a ) probable dwarf members .",

    "deep images ( 1800 sec in @xmath31 and 1200 sec in @xmath32 ) , which were taken in 1995 under nonphotometric conditions , were calibrated by means of comparing total fluxes of a sample of nonsaturated stellar images in the photometric and nonphotometric frames .",
    "after standard correction procedures the ccd frames were smoothed by means of the adaptive filtering technique described in lorenz et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and run within the midas environment .",
    "next , the sky background was fitted by a tilted plane , using the least - squares method . after background subtraction",
    "the galaxies were interactively cleaned from disturbing objects using the interactive polygon editor .",
    "the surface brightness ( sb ) distribution was analyzed by two methods .",
    "first , we calculated the equivalent light profile by slicing the smoothed galaxy image at predefined intensity levels and counting the pixel intensities in the areas between successive isophotes .",
    "the differential counts reduced to a unit area give the azimuthally averaged intensity profile of the galaxy as a function of the equivalent radius .",
    "this procedure permits to enhance signal - to - noise ratio for the faint outskirts of the galaxies and to proceed the sb profile until @xmath33 .",
    "a set of isophotal , effective and asymptotic photometric parameters was determined on the basis of the equivalent light profiles and light growth curves .",
    "the second approach should receive some information about the two - dimensional structure .",
    "for this purpose , we used the ellipse fitting algorithm of bender & mllenhoff ( 1986 ) as available in midas .",
    "we obtained a set of radial profiles - surface brightness ( sb ) , axis ratio ( b / a ) , position angle ( pa ) and decentering ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) - in each particular passband .",
    "the color - index profile was calculated by means of combining these particular sb profiles .",
    "the sb profiles depend on the morphological type and bear some information about the possible environmental influences on the dynamical evolution of galaxies .",
    "preliminary inspection of the derived sb profiles reveals that those of the lsb dwarf galaxies show minor deviations from the pure exponential mostly in their inner parts , because of the occurrence of star - forming knots , if any .",
    "the outer ( generally rather noisy ) profile might represent the older , underlying disk of the dwarf galaxy and therefore provides physically meaningful parameters when fitted by an exponential density law .",
    "+ the luminous group members show evidence of multiple components in their sb profiles .",
    "however , the conventional bulge / disk decomposition looks straightforward only for the parent galaxy ic 65 and the late type lsb galaxy ugc 608 , both of which show evidence of a faint bulge and/or a bar component .",
    "another bright member galaxy ugc 622 shows a typical type ii profile ( freeman 1970 ) , and the `` edge - on '' galaxy is evidently a pure late type disk galaxy . the obvious first step is to fit the sb profiles with the exponential intensity law @xmath36 .",
    "the scaling parameters ( @xmath37 ) have been obtained from the sb profiles using the `` marking the disk '' method .",
    "the disk fitting range was defined for each galaxy individually in outer part of the profile . in the case of ic 65 and",
    "ugc 608 , both of which show reliable excess light above the exponential disk model , this extra light was modeled with a sersic ( 1968 ) power law @xmath38 , which has been found proper when describing the light distribution of spiral bulges ( e.g. andredakis et al .",
    "the main photometric results are presented in the form of a ) a set of 2d images ( broad - band optical and nir image , color - index image , hi contour image ( when available ) ; b ) 1d radial profiles ( sb and color - index profiles , etc . ) ; c ) tables with conventional photometric and exponential model parameters .",
    "the 2d images show important morphological aspects such as the bulge contribution , the presence of bars and the shape of spiral arms .",
    "we apply contours of the laplacian - filtered image in order to reveal specific morphological features in luminous parts of the galaxies . for the bright galaxies we extracted individual @xmath39 and @xmath40 frames from the 2mass database , and showed the @xmath2 composite image , which characterizes the distribution of old stellar populations in these galaxies .",
    "we also showed the color - index image of each bright galaxy and of those dwarf galaxies for which reliable colors could be obtained above the noise level .",
    "it is especially useful to visualize the stellar population and dust distribution .",
    "the parameters describing the axis - ratio ( @xmath41 ) and the orientation ( @xmath42 ) of the galaxy isophotes were calculated as an average obtained from fitting ellipses typically to the range of isophotes 24 - 25.5 @xmath13 . in order to quantify the irregularities in optical morphology of the outer disk of regular galaxies",
    ", we calculated the _ decentering degree _ as the displacement of the center of the most external isophote with respect to the luminosity center , normalized to the last measured radius ( marquez & moles 1999 ) .",
    "here we present an abridged version of the obtained results for the parent galaxy ic 65 ( fig .",
    "3 ) as well as for all four new probable dwarf members of the group ( figs .  4 - 7 ) .",
    "more results for all studied galaxies are given in vennik & hopp ( 2004 ) .",
    "to our present knowledge , groups of galaxies are a proper place to study interactions since the galaxy encounters in groups occur at lower velocities , compared to the clusters of galaxies , and may lead to efficient merging events .",
    "dominant luminous galaxies in the group can potentially reveal the history and evolutionary status of the respective system .",
    "old groups usually contain one or several luminous ellipticals , which may have formed in merging episodes and could have structures reminiscent of past interaction events . on the other hand ,",
    "pure spiral groups should be dynamically younger aggregates .",
    "their members could reveal ongoing interaction through morphological distortions and in their possibly triggered star - formation activity ( tanvuia et al .",
    "the dynamically youngest groups are good places to look for galaxies evolving at @xmath43 0 .",
    "the analysis ( of available photometric and kinematic data ) for the ic 65 group of galaxies leads to the following results :    @xmath44 this particular compact group of four luminous late type spiral galaxies is well isolated both in redshifts and in projection to the sky . we could identify four lsb dwarf companion candidates on deep dss 2 frames according to their sb , color and morphology .",
    "+ @xmath44 available hi imaging data show that all bright members and at least one new dwarf companion are rich in hi with hi - mass to blue luminosity ratios in the range of 0.4  1.2 .",
    "their hi halos are typically twice as extended as the optical holmberg radii of individual galaxies .",
    "the outer hi isophotes ( with column densities in the range of 2.3  8.6 @xmath45 atoms  @xmath46 ) generally appear disturbed , especially in ic 65 and in ugc 622 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "+ @xmath44 optical morphology of bright galaxies generally appears to be regular , with minor disturbances in outer isophotes : e.g. in ic 65 the decentering degree is @xmath47 8.2 % and in ugc 622 ",
    "@xmath47 6.3% , which are significantly larger than the average decentering of 2.4 @xmath48 2.7 % , found by marquez & moles ( 1999 ) for isolated spirals .",
    "+ @xmath44 all bright group members ( except pgc 138291 , which we could not study in such detail ) consist of many blue star - forming knots and plumes , especially ugc 608 .",
    "+ @xmath44 ugc 622 is a scd galaxy without a classical bulge , but containing a tiny bright nucleus .",
    "it shows type ii sb profile with two exponential sections of different scale lengths .",
    "+ @xmath44 new probable dwarf companions are all of irregular appearance with blue knots , especially a  0101 + 4744 and a  0100 + 4734 , for which a chain of blue sf patches give a cometary appearance .",
    "+ @xmath44 significant positive color gradients were found in lsb dwarf galaxies of short scale lengths , and they are related to starbursts .",
    "late type dwarfs generally show a stellar population gradient , i.e. younger and bluer stars are more centrally concentrated and redder stars dominate the underlying older disk component .",
    "morphologically disruptive interactions are expected to be more common in low - velocity - dispersion ( @xmath49 ) less evolved groups such as the local group and the m 81 group ( zabludoff 2001 ) .",
    "the ic 65 group of galaxies obviously belongs to the class of less evolved groups : with its @xmath49 = 70 km / s , observed drift in optical isophotes and obvious tidal features in hi outer isophotes , as well as with the evidence of enhanced sf activity in fragile dwarf companion candidates let us conclude that the ic 65 group of galaxies is probably dynamically young and possibly at the stage of its collapse .",
