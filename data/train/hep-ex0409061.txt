    "the na48 experiment at cern , originally designed for the measurement of the direct cp violation @xcite , performs also a rare - decay programme for the @xmath4 and @xmath0 mesons . here",
    "we report on recent measurements of the decays @xmath1 ( @xmath5 ) @xcite , @xmath2 ( @xmath6 ) and @xmath3 .",
    "results for the last two are preliminary .",
    "the @xmath0 beam was produced every 17  s in 4.8  s spills , @xmath7 @xmath0s / spill , by 400  gev protons from cern sps .",
    "the @xmath0 production target was located 126  m ( more than 20 @xmath8 ) before the 114  m fiducial volume .",
    "the detector ( cf . ref .",
    "@xcite ) consists of the magnetic and neutral spectrometer .",
    "the magnetic spectrometer consists of 4 drift chambers and bending magnet .",
    "its momentum resolution is below 1% .",
    "time resolution of the trigger hodoscope is 150  ns .",
    "neutral decays are measured in the electromagnetic calorimeter hodoscope , filled with liquid krypton and segmented into 13,212 separately read - out cells .",
    "its energy resolution is better than 1% .",
    "the spectrometer also contains a muon veto hodoscope and an additional hadronic calorimeter for independent energy measurement .",
    "decay matrix element may be expanded in partial waves , parametrized in terms of form factors @xmath10 , @xmath11 ( axial - vector part ) and @xmath12 ( vector part ) , and analysed in cabibbo - maksymowicz ( cm ) variables : invariant masses of the dipion @xmath13 and dilepton @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 angles @xmath17 and @xmath18 relative to the @xmath0 momentum , and angle @xmath19 between the dipion and dilepton planes @xcite .",
    "two types of triggers were used : the minimum bias trigger for which the requirements for the total energy deposit , hit multiplicity in drift chambers and hits coincidence in the hodoscope were used , and the dedicated @xmath5 trigger where in addition clusters multiplicity in the calorimeter were required .",
    "efficienies of both triggers were close to 99% .",
    "the most important cuts defining the @xmath5 sample were those suppressing the @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) channel ( @xmath22 around 1 for electron cadidate and @xmath23 _ vs. _ @xmath24 in disagreement with @xmath25 hypothesis ) and @xmath6 with two bremsstrahlung photons ( @xmath26 ) ( @xmath27 around @xmath28 and positivity constraint for @xmath29 energy ) .",
    "background from these processes was further diminished ( @xmath30 for @xmath26 and @xmath31 for @xmath32 ) by using neural network algorithm trained on geometric characteristics of showers and tracks .",
    "total sample amounted to 5464 @xmath5 with 62 background events .",
    "the branching ratio was determined using normalization to the @xmath21 channel , accounting for trigger efficiencies and monte carlo determined acceptances .",
    "it was found @xmath33 @xcite , where the systematic error is dominated by the uncertainty of the @xmath21 branching ratio .",
    "this result is in agreement with previous measurements @xcite and has significantly higher accuracy ( cf .",
    "fig .  1 . ) .     branching ratio results .",
    "the belt refers to the overall na48 result .",
    "_ ]    the @xmath34 is predominantly sensitive to chiral coupling @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "its value was found to be @xmath36 , in agreement with previous measurement @xcite and theoretical calculations within chiral perturbation theory @xcite but with higher accuracy .",
    "the form factors were determined by fitting differential cross sections to the data in cm variables .",
    "detector acceptance was accounted for by using monte carlo generator with radiative corrections and with flat form factors ( cf .",
    "2 ) .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the form factors values obtained from the fit were ( @xmath37 ) @xmath38 systematic errors are dominated by the background .",
    "the values are consistent with the fnal measurements @xcite and have higher accuracy .",
    "significantly non - zero value of @xmath39 indicates a possiblity of the @xmath40 rule violation at percent level .",
    "measurement of the @xmath6 decay was motivated by ( i ) lack of experimental clarity for the non - zero values of non - vector form factors @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and ( ii ) need for a precise test of the unitarity condition @xmath44 by a higher accuracy @xmath45 mesurement .    event selection was based on the @xmath46 requirement for one track .",
    "the @xmath21 background was reduced to the level @xmath47 by cuts on a combined kinematic variables assuming @xmath25 mass hypothesis .",
    "the muon veto was used for suppressing the @xmath48 background below @xmath49 . in total ,",
    "about 7 millions @xmath6 events were selected .",
    "the form factor analysis was performed by parametrizing the dalitz distribution as @xmath50 , where the vector component was parametrized as @xmath51 and the non - vector component as @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 depending on energies and masses only .",
    "two dalitz - density analyses were performed : ( i ) the complete analysis in three variables @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , and ( ii ) the two - dimensional analysis using only @xmath56 and @xmath57 , where pure @xmath58 coupling was assumed . in the first case ( scalar and tensor form factors allowed )",
    "the following results were obtained :     of the vector form factor for the @xmath6 decay . _ ]    latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned } \\lambda_+ & = & 0.0284\\pm 0.0007_{stat}\\pm 0.0013_{syst } \\nonumber \\\\        and for pure @xmath58 coupling @xmath60 both results are at confidence level 70% and systematic errors are dominanted by the uncertainty of the @xmath0 momentum spectrum .",
    "it is seen that the values of the slope @xmath61 in both analyses are in perfect agreement within errors and the values of @xmath42 and @xmath43 are consistent with zero .",
    "this suggests that there is no significant deviation from the @xmath58 coupling hypothesis , contrary to earlier results from the @xmath62 measurement from jinr @xcite and with qualitative agreement with many other experimental findings .",
    "compilation of results for the slope in the vector form factor @xmath61 is presented in fig .",
    "the na48 result agrees with the others and exhibits the highest accuracy , exceeding also recent results from other high - rate kaon experiments ktev @xcite and cplear @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 branching ratio was also determined using normalization to the @xmath63 channel .",
    "it was found to be @xmath64 .",
    "experimental error is dominated by systematic uncertainty of the @xmath0 momentum spectrum .",
    "statistical error is negligible .",
    "the normalization error represents the contribution to the systematic error coming from the uncertainty of the @xmath65 used for normalization .",
    "it is known that experimental value of the sum @xmath66 deviates from 1 by @xmath67 and , excluding @xmath68 , this slight discrepancy may either originate from @xmath69 or @xmath45 .",
    "the ckm element @xmath45 can be determined from the @xmath6 decay rate using relation @xmath70 and the phase - space integral @xmath71 . after correcting for radiative process , by counting radiative events inside dalitz - plot @xcite",
    ", one gets @xmath72 . taking average @xmath73 from chiral models : @xmath74 , we obtained @xmath75 .",
    "this is in agreement with the standard model prediction @xmath76 , assuming the value of @xmath77 @xcite and the ckm unitarity .",
    "our result gives us a tighter constraint on @xmath45 and , together with values for @xmath69 and @xmath78 , persistent discrepancy with the unitarity condition .",
    "very recently , the ktev group performed similar studies @xcite finding @xmath79 , consistent with unitarity of the ckm matrix .",
    "this rare decay proceeds via two virtual photons , each converting into @xmath81 pair .",
    "this allows for determination of the form factor for the @xmath82 decay vertex , being itself of interest for other @xmath0 leptonic decays .",
    "the 4-track trigger conditions ( space points in drift chambers and at least two reconstructed 2-track vertices ) were combined with a number of off - line cuts .",
    "main cuts used for background reduction were those on each track s @xmath83 , reconstructed kaon @xmath84 gev@xmath85 and @xmath86 gev ( cf . figs . 4 and 5 ) .",
    "after all selections 200 @xmath80 events were found with an estimated background being less than 1% . from this , using the @xmath89 channel for normalization and monte carlo for acceptance corrections , it was found @xmath90 .      9 na48 , a. lai et al . ,",
