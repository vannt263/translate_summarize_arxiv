    "entanglement entropy ( ee ) of gaussian systems has been studied thoroughly in the literature @xcite , and the focus of this paper is mostly on one spatial dimension .",
    "much of the literature involves calculating the ee when the reduced subsystem @xmath2 is taken to be one or more line intervals or , in the discretized case , one or more sets of adjacent lattice points . except for a few cases , such as a conformal field theory @xcite or a massive scalar on @xmath3 at zero temperature @xcite ,",
    "the ee is notoriously hard to compute analytically , and one often relies on numerical approaches .",
    "the question naturally arises whether the ee can be computed exactly if we did not restrict our subsystem @xmath2 to a line interval or adjacent lattice points . in this paper",
    ", we examine this question by studying gaussian systems on a lattice with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "they can arise from field theories compactified on a spatial circle of circumference @xmath4 , in which we regulate the uv divergence by discretizing the circle into @xmath5 lattice sites with lattice separation @xmath6 . concretely",
    ", we will consider a free ( 1 + 1)-dimensional massive scalar field discretized on a lattice , but the general idea can be applied to any gaussian quantum many - body system with translation symmetry .    to allow an analytical treatment , we choose the subsystem @xmath2 to be a periodic sublattice , consisting of @xmath7 evenly spaced lattice points such that @xmath8 this is summarized in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the advantage of choosing our subsystem @xmath2 in this way is that discrete translation symmetry along the circle is preserved .",
    "this will allow us to compute the ee @xmath9 exactly , despite the fact that it can be seen ( or used ) as a notion of multipartite entanglement .",
    "exact solvability is rooted in two features .",
    "firstly , for gaussian systems the ee can be obtained solely from the two - point correlation functions between the lattice sites of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "secondly , for such periodic sublattices we show that the two - point correlation matrix can be diagonalized using theorems about eigenvalues of circulant matrices .",
    "while part of our motivation is to simply have new quantum systems whose ee can be computed exactly , sublattice ee is an interesting field of study in its own right .",
    "for instance , sublattice ee with @xmath10 in spin chains was shown to be an order parameter that could signal quantum phase transitions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in one spatial dimension , sublattice ee grows extensively with the size of the sublattice even in the vacuum , in contrast to the usual logarithmic growth @xcite .",
    "we confirm this in our bosonic models as well , at least for sublattices @xmath2 with sufficiently many lattice sites .",
    "extensivity arises because the number of interface points between @xmath2 and its complement is equal to the size of @xmath2 .",
    "this continues to hold in the continuum limit , and it would be interesting to understand this holographically .    finally , we are also motivated to study the behavior of sublattice ee in various limits , such as the massless limit , the continuum limit , and the high and low temperature limits .",
    "the continuum limit we will consider here is one where both @xmath5 and @xmath11 are taken to infinity with @xmath7 fixed .",
    "this setup entangles a sparse set of points with the rest of the degrees of freedom living on the circle , as shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we present our model and discuss some relevant properties of circulant matrices . in section 3 , we review the general techniques to compute the ee exactly for gaussian systems . these techniques are applied to periodic sublattices in section 4 , which forms the bulk of this paper and is where the novel results are presented .",
    "while the techniques developed below are generally applicable to arbitrary gaussian systems , for a more detailed explanation of this point . ]",
    "we choose for concreteness to study a ( 1 + 1)-dimensional massive scalar field with hamiltonian @xmath12\\ .\\ ] ] the space is compact with length @xmath4 and we impose periodic boundary conditions @xmath13 .",
    "we then discretize the theory by letting @xmath14 be the allowed positions on the circle , with @xmath15 and @xmath16 . denoting @xmath17 and @xmath18",
    "so that both @xmath19 and @xmath20 are dimensionless , the hamiltonian becomes @xmath21\\ ] ] with periodic boundary condition @xmath22 .",
    "this is just a set of coupled harmonic oscillators , which has been considered already in @xcite and in many subsequent papers .",
    "the ground state wave function is normalizable and well - defined only if @xmath23 .",
    "the dimensionless parameters in this theory are @xmath24 , @xmath5 , and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the inverse temperature .",
    "the reduced density matrix also depends on @xmath7 , so we have four dimensionless parameters that the ee depends upon .    as we will review in detail in the next section , the calculation of the ee for gaussian systems can be computed from the two - point correlation functions of fields evaluated within the subsystem . for our model , the relevant correlators between any two points on the lattice",
    "are well known from the literature , into creation and annihilation operators . ] and we follow the notation used in @xcite",
    ". we will in particular only be interested in the correlators between points on the sublattice that are labeled by @xmath27 . by rescaling the indices by @xmath11 so that they instead run from @xmath28 to @xmath29",
    ", the correlators on the sublattice then take the form @xmath30 with @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is given via the dispersion relation @xmath33    the correlators in are true in any state for which @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the annihilation and creation operators appearing in the mode expansion of the scalar field .",
    "these conditions are for instance satisfied in the vacuum state and in the thermal state with inverse temperature @xmath37 , the latter following from the fact @xmath38= { \\text{tr}\\,}[\\rho_\\beta \\,a_i^\\dagger\\ , a_j^\\dagger]=0\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the thermal density matrix",
    ". they also are satisfied in typical states subjected to random unitary dynamics , as we will discuss in @xcite .",
    "the average number of particles with momentum mode @xmath40 in the thermal state is given by the bose - einstein distribution : @xmath41    observe that the correlation matrices in only depend on the difference @xmath42 ; such matrices are called toeplitz matrices .",
    "in fact , since we are considering periodic sublattices , the correlation matrices fall into an even more restrictive class of matrices known as _ circulant matrices_. a circulant matrix is a matrix where every row is a cyclic right shift of the row above it , so that the entire matrix is determined by its first row .",
    "for instance , the @xmath43 matrix @xmath44 is circulant , and is commonly denoted in the literature by its first row as @xmath45 .",
    "circulant matrices have many desirable properties .",
    "for instance , the sum or the product of two circulant matrices is again circulant .",
    "furthermore , their eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be determined rather easily ; for an @xmath46 circulant matrix @xmath47 the eigenvalues are given by @xmath48 and the corresponding eigenvectors are @xmath49 notice that circulant matrices all have the same eigenvectors , so that circulant matrices commute and can be diagonalized simultaneously .",
    "this is the key feature that will allow the analytical treatment of ees , as we show in the next section .",
    "for some references on circulant matrices , see @xcite .",
    "we conclude this section by pointing out that the reason the correlation matrices in our model are circulant is due to the structure of our hamiltonian .",
    "our model of a discretized massive scalar field theory on a circular lattice belongs to a more general class of coupled harmonic oscillators with hamiltonian @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a symmetric coupling matrix .",
    "translational invariance then implies that @xmath52 is toeplitz , and the periodic boundary condition @xmath22 implies that @xmath52 is circulant . the hamiltonian is a special case of with nearest - neighbor interactions @xmath53 the two - point correlation matrices of a theory are circulant if @xmath52 is circulant .",
    "however , for general subsystems , the correlation matrices restricted to the reduced subsystem will only be toeplitz .",
    "the general idea behind our method is to choose a subsystem that again respects periodicity , so that the correlation matrices restricted to the subsystem are still circulant .",
    "it is easy to check that the correlation matrices in are circulant as , for a fixed integer @xmath40 , the @xmath46 matrix @xmath54 is circulant .",
    "this idea has a broad range of applicability , since the interactions need not be restricted to nearest - neighbor interactions as in , but can also include long - range interactions as long as @xmath52 is circulant .",
    "for gaussian systems , the ee can be computed from the two - point correlators @xcite .",
    "we will use this so - called real time approach to compute the ee instead of the euclidean approach where the popular replica trick is often utilized , though both approaches are directly related @xcite .",
    "although we will be mainly focused on bosonic systems , many of the concepts presented in this section can be straightforwardly extended to fermionic gaussian systems as well .",
    "we begin by constructing the vector consisting of positions and momenta living on the sublattice @xmath55 where @xmath56 .",
    "this allows us to introduce a @xmath57 covariance matrix @xmath58 with components @xcite @xmath59 where @xmath60 run from @xmath61 and @xmath62 is the anticommutator .",
    "as this is an even - dimensional positive - definite matrix , williamson s theorem @xcite states that there exists a symplectic transformation @xmath63 that diagonalizes @xmath58 , i.e. @xmath64 here the @xmath65 s are _ not _ the eigenvalues of @xmath58 , since eigenvalues are not preserved under a symplectic transformation .",
    "they are instead what are known as symplectic eigenvalues .",
    "these symplectic eigenvalues of @xmath58 are doubly degenerate , and it can be shown that they are all at least @xmath66 as a consequence of the uncertainty principle @xcite .",
    "the reason these symplectic eigenvalues are interesting is because they allow us to determine the reduced density matrix @xcite . under the symplectic transformation ,",
    "@xmath67 is mapped to @xmath68 .",
    "since @xmath69 is diagonal , we can decompose the components of @xmath70 into creation and annihilation operators : @xmath71 in this basis , the reduced density matrix factorizes as @xcite @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the williamson number operator . from the parameters",
    "@xmath74 the modular hamiltonian @xmath75 , defined via the equation @xmath76 can be written as @xmath77 furthermore , one can establish that @xmath78 is related to the symplectic eigenvalue @xmath65 via the relation @xmath79 because the eigenvalues of @xmath80 are @xmath81 and the ee is by definition @xmath82 applying and leads directly to the equation @xmath83\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that in order for this equation to make sense , we indeed require that the symplectic eigenvalues are greater than or equal to @xmath66 .",
    "we also remark that for large @xmath65 , the term in the summation simplifies to @xmath84    we remark here that some of the literature , i.e. @xcite , also express the ee in terms of the parameters @xmath85 when @xmath86 , we have @xmath87 and when @xmath88 we have @xmath89 . in terms of these variables",
    "we can write the ee as @xmath90 the ee diverges when @xmath91 for some @xmath92 .",
    "this happens in the massless limit , as well as in the infinite temperature limit .    as an intermezzo",
    ", it is very instructive to prove the first law of ee using the symplectic eigenvalues , that is , @xmath93 where @xmath75 is the modular hamiltonian .",
    "first , we compute @xmath94 using and obtain @xmath95 next , from and we get @xmath96 using the relations and and after some algebra , we again arrive at the right - hand side of , thus proving the first law of ee . to our knowledge , has not appeared in the literature before , and it provides a novel and efficient way of computing variations in the ee . in the next section , we will exploit it to compute the variation of ee under an infinitesimal temperature deviation from the vacuum .",
    "thus far , everything in this section applies to any generic gaussian systems . for the hamiltonian",
    "however , the covariance matrix further simplifies because there are no correlations between @xmath97 and @xmath20 , as can be checked using mode expansions .",
    "therefore , @xmath98 is in fact block diagonal : @xmath99 where @xmath100 and @xmath101 were defined in .",
    "we used the fact @xmath97 and @xmath19 commute for any @xmath102 and @xmath103 in the second equality , so @xmath104 ; the analogous statement holds for the @xmath105 s .",
    "in general , given a toeplitz matrix , it is not always easy to determine its symplectic eigenvalues .",
    "however , because @xmath58 is block diagonal , it has been shown that its symplectic eigenvalues ( ignoring the double degeneracy ) are precisely the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath106 @xcite .",
    "our task is further simplified by the fact that the matrices @xmath107 and @xmath108 are circulant and are hence simultaneously diagonalizable .",
    "thus , if @xmath109 are the eigenvalues of @xmath107 and @xmath110 are those of @xmath108 , the eigenvalues of @xmath106 , and hence the symplectic eigenvalues of @xmath58 , are given by @xmath111 as the eigenvalues of circulant matrices are given in , we can now determine the @xmath65 s via , which will in turn let us determine the ee via .",
    "we present the results in the next section .",
    "as we mentioned in the previous section , the fact @xmath107 and @xmath108 are circulant matrices implies that their eigenvectors are both given by . we can thus compute their respective eigenvalues @xmath109 and @xmath110 directly from using the general formula for the eigenvalues given in . after some algebra , we obtain ( recall that @xmath112 ) @xmath113 \\ , \\\\",

    "first , we look at a system where @xmath10 , i.e. our subsystem consists of every other point on the circular lattice .",

    ", we begin our analysis of the case when @xmath10 with only two points on the circle .",
    "then our subsystem @xmath2 consists of only one point , as depicted in figure [ fig3 ] .    in this simple case ,",

    "this is the case when the separation distance between neighboring lattice sites diverges .    to make contact with @xcite",
    ", we could have expressed our results using @xmath129 defined in .",
    "as there s only one symplectic eigenvalue , we have @xmath130 the ee in this case is given by , and the reduced subsystem is a single oscillator in a thermal bath with effective temperature @xmath131 @xcite .",
    "we verify that the ee we compute indeed matches that obtained in the literature . ] ]    in the small mass limit where @xmath132 , the symplectic eigenvalue is @xmath133 which yields the vacuum ee @xmath134 the first term is a logarithmic divergence for small mass , while the second one is finite and independent of the mass @xmath125 .    next , let us move away from the vacuum and compute the correction to the ee for small temperatures where @xmath135 . using the asymptotic form of @xmath136 for @xmath137 infinity in ,",
    "we find @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the symplectic eigenvalue in the vacuum .",
    "assuming we are far from the decompactification limit , i.e. @xmath140 , the second term is exponentially suppressed and hence can be dropped .",
    "we can now use to determine the infinitesimal change in ee away from zero temperature , given that @xmath141 . in the small mass limit where @xmath142 , we find @xmath143 this result is free of divergences , and though we only computed the leading order prefactor , the corrections can easily be computed as well .",
    "the result implies that small temperature corrections are exponentially suppressed in the correlators and in the ee , a property that should be true in general .",
    "we now turn to the case where we keep the temperature finite and nonzero , and take the small mass limit @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "then it follows to leading order @xmath146 with corresponding ee @xmath147 where @xmath148 henceforth indicates subleading terms that vanish in the limit we are considering .",
    "the first term is divergent at criticality ( zero mass limit ) , and the remaining terms are independent of @xmath125 .",
    "lastly , let us see what happens in the high temperature limit , where we let @xmath149 with @xmath24 fixed .",
    "the symplectic eigenvalue to leading order becomes @xmath150 and the ee is given to be @xmath151 the massless limit of this expression matches the high temperature limit of , as it should .",
    "notice though that while for small temperatures the ee scales as @xmath152 , for large temperature the dependence of ee on @xmath153 becomes logarithmic .",
    "this is the standard behavior of the shannon entropy of a gaussian system in the large temperature limit .",

    "the ee is as always given via , but we again focus our attention on various limits .      as before ,",
    "the limit @xmath159 with a fixed @xmath125 corresponds to the vacuum .",

    "\\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as the vacuum ee is a function of two variables , @xmath7 and @xmath24 , we plotted the ee per lattice site , i.e. the `` ee density , '' versus @xmath24 for various values of @xmath7 in figure [ figs_ext ] .",
    "we see that the ee is extensive , i.e. the ee density is independent of @xmath7 , given sufficiently large @xmath24 and @xmath7 .",
    "notice further that the entropy is decreasing as function of the flow parameter @xmath24 .",
    "let us now examine what happens in the limit of small mass , i.e. @xmath132 . as in the case where we were only considering two points , @xmath139 diverges again like @xmath162 and contributes to the ee the term @xmath163 which yields the same divergent behavior as in the case @xmath164 ( see ) .",
    "ee typically diverges when the correlation length is much longer than the lattice spacing @xmath165 , since this allows for subsystem @xmath2 to be entangled with many lattice sites in the complement of @xmath2 . as decreasing @xmath125",
    "translates to increasing the correlation length , small @xmath24 implies the correlation length is much longer than the lattice spacing , and thus as expected we see a divergence in ee coming from the term in .",
    "thus far , we have ignored the contribution from the other symplectic eigenvalues .",
    "their contribution can be evaluated in the limit where we take the number of points @xmath5 to be very large but with @xmath166 fixed , so we may approximate the sum in as an integral . in particular , since @xmath65 is a function of @xmath167 , we may denote @xmath168 with @xmath169 . excluding the @xmath170 case , which we showed to have a divergence above",

    ", we see that the ee density indeed approaches this value for large @xmath7 as @xmath177 , although the contribution from @xmath139 still gives a divergence if @xmath24 is sufficiently small , as is also clear in figure .",
    "however , the divergence from @xmath139 has a @xmath178 suppression when we compute the ee density , so if we take the large @xmath5 limit faster than @xmath179 , this term does not contribute in the uv . for large values of @xmath24 ,",
    "the correlation length is small compared to the lattice spacing , and hence the ee goes to zero .",
    "similar to the previous subsection , we can now deviate from the vacuum and increase the temperature infinitesimally .",
    "it follows as before @xmath180 however , it is clear that the dominant term in the sum over @xmath92 in comes again from the zero mode @xmath181 , and the others are exponentially suppressed .",
    "thus , we find in the limit @xmath182 , @xmath183 which is fully consistent with the case @xmath119 .",

    "indeed , in the continuum , the ees @xmath226 and @xmath232 are simply given by for @xmath224 , and @xmath227 given for @xmath228 .",
    "it immediately follows that @xmath233 , i.e. the infinitely many lattice sites between @xmath2 and @xmath219 have completely decoupled @xmath2 from @xmath219 .",
    "further numerical analysis for very large values of @xmath234 shows that this is indeed the case .",
    "for gaussian systems , two - point correlation matrices that are circulant on a periodic sublattice lead to entanglement spectra and ees that can be computed exactly . this has been explicitly illustrated in this paper for a massive scalar field theory as a particular example .",
    "various extensions and generalizations are possible .",
    "firstly , an obvious extension is to apply the methods to fermionic systems such as spin chains .",
    "some models were already studied in @xcite , but a general analysis of ees of gaussian spin / fermionic systems at arbitrary temperatures is to our knowledge not known .",
    "secondly , the matrix of couplings @xmath52 in the potential terms of the hamiltonian , written as @xmath235 is of the nearest - neighbor type .",
    "one can extend this to any circulant matrix to include for instance long - range interactions .",
    "then one can compute how the ee changes in the presence of these long range interactions .",
    "one intriguing case , for instance , is to take all matrix entries in @xmath52 equal , so that all the lattice sites are equally connected .",
    "finally , one can try to extend our formalism to higher dimensions .",
    "for instance , in two spatial dimensions , we can take a finite square lattice with periodic boundary conditions , i.e. a discretized torus .",
    "we can then take as a periodic sublattice every @xmath11-th point in both directions , as long as @xmath11 divides the number of lattice sites in both directions .",
    "it would be interesting to work out explicit examples of these extensions .",
    "we stress that the framework presented here can be extended to any system with a gaussian correlator structure .",
    "one might think that such feature constrains the sytem to be free of interactions . as discussed in @xcite , this is not the only case , the crucial and paradigmatic example being large-@xmath5 gauge theories .",
    "a characteristic feature of such models is large-@xmath5 factorization @xcite , which implies an effective emergent gaussianity for reduced subsystems , even when the system is strongly interacting . in @xcite ,",
    "such large-@xmath5 factorization was exploited in fock space , where it implies extensivity of entanglement evolution . in @xcite , by studying the random unitary dynamics approach used in @xcite , we show the necessary conditions for an emergent spatial gaussianity , and argue that for such systems we can also apply the methods used in this paper .",
