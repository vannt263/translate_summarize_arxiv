    "<S> thus such transformations preserve the @xmath71 picture as far as the physical sector is concerned . )    historically , the @xmath6 picture was introduced first because : ( 1 ) it is more similar to the bosonic string , and ( 2 ) cyclic symmetry is manifest ( no need to bother with picture changing ) . the @xmath71 picture was then chosen because the physical - state conditions were more obvious . </S>",
    "<S> although in modern language the brst conditions are clear in either picture , it s interesting to examine the differences in the pictures if the ghosts are ignored , since the ghosts differ in different formulations of the superstring , but all formulations have similar integrated vertices . </S>",
    "<S> then the ground state of the @xmath71 picture is the  physical \" tachyon , at @xmath85 , while in the @xmath6 picture it s an  unphysical \" tachyon at @xmath86 . </S>",

    "<S> the proof of equivalence of the @xmath6 vector trees to the vector trees of our formalism is then simple : one only has to note that the operator algebra of the vertices is identical . </S>",
    "<S> but the vertices are identical in form ; only the explicit representation of the spin current is different . </S>",
    "<S> so one only has to check the equivalence of the two current algebras . since they are both ( 10d ) lorentz currents , quadratic in free fields , this means just checking that the central charge is the same . </S>",
    "<S> ( the same method has been used for comparing ps to the @xmath71 picture @xcite . ) </S>",
    "<S> the reason the result for the central charge is the same is that the gp result is the same as the gs result : the @xmath5-matrix algebra is the same except for a trace , which is 1/4 as big in the lightcone as for a covariant spinor , but gp again gets a factor of 1/4 from summing over ghosts . </S>",
    "<S> ( as we ll see below , similar arguments apply in loops , unless one gathers enough spin currents to produce a levi - civita tensor . )    the calculations in the @xmath6 picture ( and gp ) are somewhat harder than the @xmath71 picture because two vertices have been replaced with ones that generate more terms , which cancel . also , </S>",
    "<S> rns bosonic trees are simpler than ps or gp because integration over the vector fermion @xmath87 effectively does all @xmath5-matrix algebra </S>",
    "<S> . however , tree amplitudes with fermions are much harder in rns than ps or gp ( and increase in difficulty as the number of fermions increases ) . </S>",
    "<S> ps is still simpler than gp , because @xmath19 integration takes the place of the change in the two vertices , and so also avoids generating extra terms . </S>",
    "<S> so , for trees rns is the easiest for pure bosons , ps is easiest with fermions , and gp is a bit harder than both . </S>",
    "<S> however , gp requires fewer rules , since all vertices are the same , so it produces more terms at an intermediate stage but is easier to  program \" . </S>",
    "<S> this feature is a peculiarity of tree graphs : at the loop level we ll see that gp maintains the simplest rules , while rns produces extra terms that cancel ( because supersymmetry is not manifest ) .    at first sight these rules for gp might seem peculiar because there is no explicit integral over spinor zero - modes , as expected in known superspace approaches . </S>",
    "<S> the answer can be seen from examining the simpler ( and better understood ) case of 4d n=1 super yang - mills . since the vacuum of the open bosonic string can be identified with a constant yang - mills ghost ( or gauge parameter ) , </S>",
    "<S> we examine the ghost superfield @xmath79 , and look at @xmath88 , a supersymmetric condition . since this superfield is chiral , and supergraphs prefer unconstrained superfields , we write @xmath89 in terms of a general complex superfield @xmath90 . then clearly @xmath91 in our case . </S>",

    "<S> furthermore , this @xmath90 has a nice norm , @xmath93 . in hilbert - space notation </S>",
    "<S> we thus write the norm and supersymmetry as @xmath94 so the vacuum is supersymmetry invariant up to a brst triviality , and the norm includes zero - mode integration , but the extra zero - modes are absorbed by the vacuua , and no insertions are required . </S>",
    "<S> ( we could also use @xmath95 to define @xmath96 $ ] , @xmath97 . ) </S>",
    "<S> this supersymmetry of the vacuum is enough to ensure the amplitudes transform correctly , since the vertex operators are superfields times supersymmetry invariant currents , and the vacuum and vertex operators ( integrated and unintegrated ) are brst invariant . </S>",
    "<S> ( the unintegrated vertex operators we have used are brst invariant only after including terms higher - order in ghost @xmath19 s , which do nt contribute to amplitudes for massless external states , and probably not for massive ones either , because of the absence of ghost @xmath26 s to cancel them . ) </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the vacuum is  half - way \" up in the @xmath19 expansion was also found for the expansion in the spinor ghost coordinates in a lightcone analysis of the brst cohomology for the gp superparticle @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that this choice of vacuum is relevant only for trees ; at 1 loop one effectively does a ( super)trace over all states rather than a vacuum expectation value , so the vacuum is irrelevant . </S>",
    "<S> ( we assume a similar situation will occur at higher loops , but we have not checked yet . ) </S>",
    "<S> as we will see below , one important affect on this vacuum choice for trees , which does not affect loops , is that :    _ for tree graphs only , background fields are always evaluated in the wess - zumino gauge . _    </S>",

    "<S> , one can consider this picture for rns : for pure bosons , two vertices must be in the  @xmath82 picture \" , so it is convenient to consider those two as the initial and final states , using the vertex operators on the initial and final vacuua . </S>",
    "<S> generalizing only those 2 states to include fermions , we can write their vertex operators as in gp , but now identifying the currents with @xmath98 the first two are the usual for the spinor ( in the @xmath99 picture ) and vector ( in the @xmath82 picture ) , while the last can be identified as that for the spinor in the @xmath100 picture ( also with conformal weight 1 ) if we use the  supersymmetric gauge \" @xmath101 instead of the wz gauge . </S>",

    "<S> however , expansion of @xmath150 is unnecessary , because in vertex operators @xmath121 appears only as @xmath151 ( and as an argument of the superfields ) , and any contraction involving this vertex operator is always finite . </S>",
    "<S> ( the derivative kills the potentially divergent @xmath152 term . ) for this reason @xmath121 regularization gives only energy - momentum conservation and is irrelevant to amplitude corrections . </S>",
    "<S> but @xmath66 expansion of @xmath153 is crucial , as we will see in the next section .    </S>",
    "<S> here we give simple examples . </S>",
    "<S> the only differences from standard first - quantization of a loop of a scalar particle or bosonic string can be associated with  </S>",
    "<S> kinematic factors \" that may also depend on the positions of the vertices on the worldline / sheet . </S>",
    "<S> ( for a summary of the standard analysis of the other factors , see appendix [ loop ] . )    </S>",
    "<S> collecting the results of the zero - mode measure and the green function zero - mode behavior , _ the amplitude is zeroth order in @xmath66 . _    </S>",
    "<S> since there is an @xmath134 in the measure , we should pick up an @xmath154 in the integrand of the path integral . </S>",
    "<S> for example , one sub - diagram of the n - point 1-loop amplitude is proportional to @xmath155 then to evaluate this amplitude we should expand each @xmath153 and collect terms with @xmath154 .    </S>",
    "<S> we now notice that every @xmath140 gives @xmath156 . for @xmath157 </S>",
    "<S> there are not enough powers of @xmath158 and so their amplitudes just vanish .    </S>",
    "<S> there is no zero - mode behavior for any contraction involving @xmath159 because of the derivative . </S>",
    "<S> therefore @xmath37 contractions start to contribute only at @xmath160 ( a black dot in fig.[diagram ] ) .        </S>",
    "<S> the first nonvanishing amplitude is at @xmath161 . </S>",
    "<S> however , this is just the case where every @xmath140 from the @xmath162 s contributes @xmath156 . </S>",
    "<S> so the integration is trivially done for @xmath163 and only its spin algebra matters . </S>",
    "<S> there are two kinds of diagrams : the case where all 4 points are connected , and the case where each pair of points is connected separately ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ diagram ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> these two diagrams have opposite sign . </S>",
    "<S> each closed contraction should be traced over all ghost pyramid spinors to give @xmath136 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we get for @xmath164 , omitting external field factors , @xmath165\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{16}\\left[tr(\\gamma^{ab}\\gamma^{cd})tr(\\gamma^{ef}\\gamma^{gh})+\\mbox{2 permutations}~\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    using the mathematica code tracer.m we evaluate this gamma - matrix trace to find @xmath166[cd][ef][gh])\\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\f{1}{2}\\left[(\\delta^{ac}\\delta^{bd}-\\delta^{ad}\\delta^{bc})(\\delta^{eg}\\delta^{fh}-\\delta^{eh}\\delta^{fg})\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\quad\\quad+(\\delta^{ae}\\delta^{bf}-\\delta^{af}\\delta^{be})(\\delta^{cg}\\delta^{dh}-\\delta^{ch}\\delta^{dg})\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\quad\\quad+\\left.(\\delta^{ag}\\delta^{bh}-\\delta^{ah}\\delta^{bg})(\\delta^{ce}\\delta^{df}-\\delta^{cf}\\delta^{de})\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is the well - known kinematic factor for both tree and 1-loop . </S>",
    "<S> we can also express this results in terms of @xmath167 as @xcite @xmath168\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which can be interpreted as  graviton \" ,  dilaton \" , and  axion \" as far as lorentz ( and not gauge ) structure is concerned . </S>",
    "<S> ( in the nonplanar case , it actually corresponds to those poles for color singlets in the 1 + 2=3 + 4 channel . )    here we again prefer the superfield formalism as explained in section 2 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the 4-point one - loop case is dramatically simplified due to the ir regularization . consider the 4 types of fully contracted operators again and then notice that they can have only limited @xmath68 factors , since each @xmath140 gives such a factor while @xmath169 does nt :    @xmath170    this means that except for @xmath109 they appear at best from the 6-point at 1 loop . </S>",
    "<S> so the only contractions for this amplitude are from @xmath171 and @xmath172 . </S>",
    "<S> we also need to consider the case where 4 @xmath173 s act on the superfields </S>",
    "<S> . then we can directly write down the kinematic factor for the manifestly supersymmetric , 4-point , 1-loop amplitude @xmath174 } w^{\\alpha}(1)w^{\\beta}(2)w^{\\gamma}(3)w^{\\delta}(4)\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\f{3}{32}tr(\\gamma^{ab}\\gamma^{cd})d_{[\\alpha}d_{\\beta]}f_{ab}(1)f_{cd}(2)w^{\\alpha}(3)w^{\\beta}(4)+\\mbox{perm.}\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\hat{k}_{4}(f^{4})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath175 is the same as @xmath163 above except that the ( super)traces do nt include the physical @xmath176 . </S>",
    "<S> of course , this missing contribution comes from @xmath177 @xmath178 @xmath179 @xmath180 plus different permutations of the @xmath173 s . </S>",
    "<S> also , the missing contribution for the @xmath181 terms comes from @xmath182}w^{\\beta})w^{\\gamma}(d_{[\\gamma}d_{\\beta]})w^{\\delta}$ ] plus different permutations . </S>",
    "<S> note that this result already has the same form as the 4d n=1 supergraph calculation for n=4 super yang - mills @xcite ( if we rewrite it in majorana notation for comparison ) , where there @xmath183 already , so @xmath18 terms are unnecessary to produce @xmath184 . </S>",
    "<S> ( there the @xmath185 comes from overall @xmath19 integration , the @xmath173 s of the @xmath186 s being killed by loop-@xmath19 integration . )    </S>",
    "<S> we give here the fermion part of the result of ( [ 4pt1loopsuper ] ) and leave details to appendix [ superamplitude ] . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath187 where @xmath188}$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> ( the @xmath189 $ ] means to sum over permutations with signs to antisymmetrize . ) </S>",
    "<S> the second form of the ffbb amplitude can be interpreted as  axion \" and  traceless graviton \" terms . </S>",
    "<S> ( using the fermion field equation and symmetry , the former term is totally antisymmetric in @xmath190 and a total curl on the fermions , as the @xmath191 factor is then for the bosons , while the latter term is symmetric and traceless in @xmath192 . ) </S>",
    "<S> we have written these amplitudes in manifestly gauge invariant form . </S>",
    "<S> note that the complete 4-point amplitude is totally symmetric in all 4 external lines . </S>",
    "<S> ( this was clear from the original form ( [ 4pt1loopsuper ] ) . ) </S>",
    "<S> this means that not only are the specific cases listed above separately symmetric between boson lines and between fermion lines ( if we had used wave functions instead of fermionic fields then they would be antisymmetric ) , but the amplitudes for other arrangements of fermions and bosons are obtained simply by permutation . </S>",
    "<S> the usual representations are given in appendix [ superamplitude ] .    in principle </S>",
    "<S> there is no difficulty to evaluate higher - point diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> some new terms occur compared to the @xmath161 case . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , @xmath159 can contribute from one vertex , acting on a field , which is indicated by a black dot in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ diagram ] . </S>",
    "<S> ( all the other vertices contribute contractions between @xmath193 and @xmath194 from @xmath25 . ) </S>",
    "<S> terms of the green function higher - order in the @xmath66 expansion start to appear and thus @xmath195 has @xmath196 dependence . </S>",
    "<S> we give a schematic diagram for various types of contractions in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ diagram ] . </S>",
    "<S> notice that our diagram exactly coincides with earlier covariant rns results @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there can also be corrections from the fermion partition function because of regularization . </S>",
    "<S> for example , this correction in the 6-point amplitude is proportional to @xmath197 ( see appendix [ partition ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> first we will consider the part of the amplitude that does nt have a black dot in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ diagram ] . </S>",
    "<S> let s call the graphs without and with a black dot @xmath198 and @xmath199 respectively . since the 5-point amplitude has 5 sides we should choose @xmath200 from exactly one side . </S>",
    "<S> this is true for both the pentagon and triangle + ellipse graphs . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between them is the gamma matrix trace factor . </S>",
    "<S> so we can write down the part of @xmath201 for a given group - index ordering ( the @xmath202th vector has @xmath203 ) as : @xmath204\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{16}[~g^{\\theta}_{0}(z_{2}-z_{1 } ) tr(\\gamma^{a_{1}b_{1}}\\gamma^{a_{2}b_{2}}\\gamma^{a_{3}b_{3}})tr(\\gamma^{a_{4}b_{4}}\\gamma^{a_{5}b_{5}})+11~\\mbox{permutations}~]\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    then we can write @xmath205 where @xmath163 was given in subsection 5.2 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath201 and @xmath206 complete the 5-point planar amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> totally antisymmetric @xmath66-tensor terms vanish because the 5 external momenta are not independent . </S>",
    "<S> notice that the light - cone gs calculation reduces to our results after heavy algebra @xcite , and rns needs a spin - structure sum to produce this result @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we postpone the @xmath207-point amplitudes to another paper , which will be interesting because of the anomaly cancellation issue . </S>",
    "<S> one good thing in our covariant formalism is that we have a totally antisymmetric @xmath66-tensor naturally in the hexagon amplitude , where we have enough momenta to have a nonvanishing result , contrary to the 5-point case .    </S>",
    "<S> there are many avenues of further study , in particular :    \\(1 ) many types of diagrams can be calculated . at the tree level , </S>",
    "<S> diagrams with many fermions have not yet been explicitly evaluated in any formalism . </S>",
    "<S> new algebraic methods for the current algebra might be useful . at the 1-loop level , little has been done with fermions or higher - point functions . </S>",
    "<S> alternative ir regularization schemes could be considered . </S>",
    "<S> the 2-loop 4-vector calculation would be a good test , and nothing more than that has been done at 2 loops , and nothing at all at higher loops .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(2 ) the hilbert space needs to be studied covariantly , especially the vacuum , to completely justify the naive manipulations we have made for tree graphs </S>",
    "<S> . it would be useful to find the relation of these methods to supergraphs , where explicit zero - mode integrations appear ( both in loops , corresponding to @xmath26 zero - modes , and an overall integral for @xmath19 zero - modes . ) massive vertex operators for physical states are expected to also be relatively simple , as the spinor ghosts should appear again in a minimal way ( as opposed to the more complicated structure of the brst operator ) . </S>",
    "<S> the analogy to second - quantized ghost pyramids ( e.g. , for higher - rank forms ) might be useful : there ghosts beyond the first generation ( i.e. , the usual faddeev - popov ghosts ) appear only at 1 loop , to define the measure .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(3 ) closer relations to other formulations might exist . </S>",
    "<S> an analog to the @xmath71 picture of rns might further simplify tree calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the many similarities with ps suggests it might be a particular gauge choice of gp that truncates the ghost spectrum . </S>"
