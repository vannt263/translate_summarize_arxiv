    "@xcite in this paper we call attention to the fact that in `` usual '' three - dimensional ( 3d ) metals the dirac points can be located along band - contact lines in the brillouin zones of the metals , the energies of the points can fill a whole interval in the energy axis , @xcite and these dirac points lead to specific electron topological transitions in the 3d metals . at these transitions",
    "topology of the fermi surface ( fs ) in the metals changes , but this change differs from the fs transformation at the well - known topological transitions of @xmath1 kind , which were first considered by lifshits .",
    "@xcite at the topological transitions of @xmath1 kind a new void of the fs appears ( disappears ) , or a neck of the fs forms ( disrupts ) .",
    "these transitions occur near critical points @xmath2 in the brillouin zone at which the electron energy @xmath3 has an extremum or a saddle point in its dependence on the quasi - momentum @xmath4 .",
    "the small vicinities of these points give singular van hove contribution @xcite @xmath5 to the electron density of states @xmath6 , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the fermi energy of the metal , and @xmath9 is the critical energy . in the @xmath10-potential",
    "the appropriate singular contribution has the form , @xmath11 , and by analogy with the second - order transitions , the topological transitions were named the @xmath1-order transitions although they are not due to a change of any symmetry .",
    "the lifshits topological transitions and their manifestations in various physical phenomena were studied theoretically and experimentally in many papers ; see the reviews , @xcite the recent papers , @xcite and references therein .",
    "in this paper we show that the topological transitions associated with the dirac points are widespread in metals no less than the @xmath1-order transitions of lifshits .",
    "the transitions discussed here occur at the points of the band - contact lines at which the energy of two touching bands reaches its maximum or minimum on these lines .",
    "these transitions are @xmath0 kind according to the classification of ref . , and we explain how these transitions can be detected in experiments .",
    "it is common knowledge that the contact of the electron energy bands in a metal can occur at symmetry points and along symmetry axis of its brillouin zone .",
    "besides , as was shown by herring , @xcite there are _ lines of an accidental contact _ between two bands in crystals .",
    "the term `` accidental '' means that the degeneracy of electron states is not caused by their symmetry .",
    "such band - contact lines along which the spectrum of the two bands has the dirac form are widespread in metals with the inversion symmetry and with a weak spin - orbit interaction .",
    "this follows from one of herring s results : @xcite if there is a point of an intersection of two energy bands in an axis of symmetry of the brillouin zone , a band - contact line perpendicular to the axis has to pass through this point .",
    "intersection of the bands at points in the axes frequently occurs even in simple metals .",
    "@xcite the literature data show that the lines of the accidental contact exist , for example , in be , mg , zn , cd , al , graphite and many other metals .",
    "the result of herring can be understood from the following simple considerations : @xcite let the two electron bands marked by the indexes @xmath12 and @xmath13 be degenerate at a quasi - momentum @xmath14 and hence have the same energy @xmath15 at this point .",
    "the @xmath16 hamiltonian @xmath17 for these bands in the vicinity of @xmath18 has the form : @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 are the matrix elements of the velocity operator for the electron states @xmath12 and @xmath13 at the point @xmath14 .",
    "note that @xmath24 and @xmath25 are real quantities for metals with inversion symmetry and with negligible spin - orbit interaction .",

    "@xcite it follows from eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) that the spectrum has the dirac form in the plane passing through the vectors @xmath29 and @xmath24 , and the degeneracy of the bands @xmath12 and @xmath13 is not lifted along the straight line passing through the point @xmath14 in the direction of the vector @xmath30 $ ] which is perpendicular to the plane . in other words ,",
    "existence of the band - degeneracy point leads to existence of the band - contact line passing through this point .",
    "of course , this degeneracy line exists not only near @xmath14 . if one takes into account terms of higher order in @xmath31 in the expansions of @xmath32 , the band - contact line will be determined by the two equations : @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "such band - contact lines are either closed curves in the brillouin zone or end on the surface of this zone . in both the cases",
    "the energy @xmath15 of the two touching bands in the degeneracy line is a periodic function of @xmath14 running this line , and @xmath15 changes between its minimum @xmath35 and maximum @xmath36 values . in experiments ,",
    "the band - contact lines in metals can be , in principle , detected via the phase analysis of the de haas - van alphen ( or shubnikikov - de haas ) oscillations since the phase of these oscillations is determined by the number of the band - contact lines penetrating the appropriate cross - section of the fermi surface .",
    "@xcite    let the fermi level @xmath8 of the metal lie in the interval : @xmath37 .",
    "then , the fermi surface @xmath38 of this metal in the vicinity of a point @xmath14 defined by @xcite @xmath39 consists of two cones with the common vertex @xmath14 and the same vertex angle penetrated by the band - contact line , see the inset in fig .",
    "one of the cones corresponds to the band @xmath12 , and the second cone corresponds to the band @xmath13 . in other words , the fermi surface has the self - intersecting shape .",

    "[ fig1][fig3 ] ) and by a sign of @xmath91 which specifies if the self - intersecting surfaces appear or disappear at @xmath92 .",
    "the electron spectrum near any critical point of interest can be reduced to expression ( [ 5 ] ) .    if a weak spin - orbit interaction is taken into account , inspection of a narrow `` tube '' in the place of the band - contact line",
    "becomes more appropriate in analyzing the electron energy spectra . inside this tube",
    "the two bands closely approach each other without their touching .",
    "hence the intersection of the appropriate fermi surfaces , strictly speaking , does not occur ( there is a small space gap between them ) .",
    "however , as our analysis shows , this fact has no essential effect on the results presented below , and so we , as a rule , neglect the spin - orbit interaction here . for reference , we note that with the spin - orbit interaction , the spectrum ( [ 5 ] ) transforms into , @xmath93^{1/2}\\!\\!\\!\\ ! ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath94 is the energy gap between the bands at @xmath95 .",
    "interestingly , at @xmath96 a minimum of the upper band and a maximum the lower band in @xmath97 occur at different values of @xmath97 , and the spectrum ( [ 5a ] ) is characterized by the indirect energy gap @xmath98 . at @xmath99",
    "the indirect gap is zero .",
    "near @xmath100 the density of the electron states @xmath6 calculated per unit volume of the crystal is the sum of its regular part @xmath101 and of its singular part @xmath5 .",

    "@xcite if @xmath106 , the singular term is absent .",
    "note that the singularity in the density of the electron states , @xmath107 , is weaker than the singularity @xmath108 at the well - known topological transitions of @xmath1 kind @xcite when a fermi - surface void appears ( disappears ) or a neck of the fermi surface forms ( disrupts ) .",
    "it also follows from formula ( [ 7 ] ) that the singular contribution to the @xmath10-potential has now the form , @xmath109 , and the topological transitions considered here are the @xmath0-order transitions according to the classification of lifshits .",
    "@xcite    it is known @xcite that the topological properties of any closed surface are completely determined by the number of its components ( its disconnected parts ) and by the number of handles for each of the components .",
    "how can the transitions consisting in appearing ( disappearing ) the self - intersecting fermi surfaces be understood from this point of view ?",
    "( recall that , in reality , there is a small gap between the touching fss if one takes into account a weak spin - orbit interaction , and the intersection of the surfaces , strictly speaking , does not occur . )",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] that at @xmath110 the appearance of the self - intersecting fs is equivalent to the disappearance of the handle that exists in the fs of the first band at @xmath111 and to the simultaneous appearance of the ovaloid of the second band .",

    "for these two combined transitions at @xmath35 and @xmath36 , the changes of the fermi - surface components or their handles are evident . on the other hand , at @xmath112 the appearance of the self - intersecting fs",
    "does not change the number of its components and handles , fig .",
    "in other words , there is no topological transition at @xmath112 , and it is for this reason that the density of the electron states does not exhibit any singularity in this case . in this context , it would be more properly to name the topological transitions discussed here the combined electron topological transitions rather than the appearance ( disappearance ) of the self - intersecting fermi surfaces .",
