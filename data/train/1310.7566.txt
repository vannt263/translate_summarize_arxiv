    "in the last decades , some statistics methods formulated to find signals in data sets of x - ray astronomy were developed , some of them based on bayesian statistics . for example , @xcite developed a method able to detect and characterize periodical signals of unknown shapes and periods . on the other hand , @xcite developed a method able to detect changing points on piecewise constant signals , which could , in principle , be used to determine if a source increases abruptly its luminosity , as while a burst .",
    "most of these methods assume a parametric distribution as the background statistical model .",
    "usually , in x - ray astronomy data analysis , the poisson distribution is used for this purpose , because the process of photon detection is considered as a poisson process , with a time - dependent rate @xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless , the process of counting photons in a ccd is not a poisson process . some photon counts result lost because of the pile - up effect @xcite .",
    "pile - up occurs when two or more photons are collected by the same or adjacent pixels in the same frame , so they result counted as only one event of greater energy .    in this paper ,",
    "two probability distributions that consider pile - up are introduced .",
    "they are obtained independently : one is based on the poisson distribution , and the other , on the exponential probability density . to prove their validity ,",
    "they are fitted to real data from rx j0720.4 - 2125 , measured by xmm - newton epic instrument . also , they are compared to each other through numerical simulations .",
    "the results show that the proposed probability distributions describe the statistics of the real data set remarkably well , and they could be used to analyze similar sets of data typically found in x - ray astronomical observations .",
    "the distributions presented in this work could be used to reformulate or improve some of the statistical methods currently used in x - ray astronomy data analysis but do not account for the pile - up effect .",
    "for x - ray telescopes working in a frame mode , the data consist of a list of counts where every count ideally corresponds to an arriving photon .",
    "these entries have attributes like detection time , photon energy , detection pattern ( or grade ) , @xmath1 and @xmath2 pixel coordinates , etc . in this paper",
    "we do not discuss the processes of data reduction and selection : we will concentrate our attention only on the arrival time of the detected events ( counts ) , which are supposed to come from a single sky source . all the necessary work to prepare the data we suppose was previously done .",
    "but in practice , some of the arriving photons are not detected by the instrument , that is , do not generate counts . on the other hand ,",
    "some counts could be not provoked by photons : for example , a count could be provoked by another incoming particle , or even , by an electronic noise .    in general , the arrival of photons to a telescope is a poisson process : such events are totally independent of one another .",
    "the incoming photons are reflected in a focusing system , and then they are collected by a detector , which in this case is a ccd array . but",
    "some photons are not reflected in mirrors , and some photons do not interact with ccds .",
    "these two phenomena , which depend on photon energy , are completely stochastic , so they do not break the initial poissonian character of the arriving photons phenomenon , that is , the interaction of photons with the detector ( or photon collection ) is a poisson process too .",
    "these effects can be described by factors that give the optical and quantum efficiencies @xcite .",
    "the estimation of the fraction of photons rejected by them is straightforward , but it is out of the scope of the present work .    when an individual photon interacts with a ccd , it makes an electrically charged print in one or more pixels @xcite .",
    "the ccd collects photons for a time called _ frame time _ , which is a fundamental time bin imposed by the instrument .",
    "when the frame time finishes , all the pixels are read , and the information of which pixels were charged and their respective amounts of electrical charge , is saved .",
    "the reading process takes some time in which the image is moved to the readout register and the collection of photons of sky sources occur in spread areas of the image , so the corresponding counts are usually discarded when the data of a particular sky source are extracted .",
    "then , the reading times can be considered as dead times in which the instrument is blind ( time gaps ) , and so they do not alter the poissonian nature of the photon interaction process .",
    "but there are features of ccd that bias the data and break the poissonian character of the photon counting process : the most important is pile - up . as we stated out earlier ,",
    "pile - up occurs when , in the same frame , two or more photons hit very close pixels , and they are interpreted as a single event ( count ) . as pile - up is an instrument saturation effect , it is not a poisson process , so the statistics of counts can not be properly described by the probability distributions for poisson processes .",
    "it is important to note that the probability of pile - up depends on the instrument characteristics and the energies of the collected photons .",
    "several authors @xcite    have studied pile - up making a detailed analysis of the mechanism of grade migration , which is fundamental if the objective is the spectral analysis or the luminosity measure of a stellar source , as pile - up provokes an apparent harder spectrum .",
    "but the scope of this work is different : it is to find probability distributions capable to describe the statistics of counts of astronomical x - ray data with no distinction between photon energies .",
    "the main purpose of them is to be used as likelihood functions ( i.e. , as background statistical models ) in statistical methods devoted to time - series signal shape characterization , which are commonly used to find periodical pulsations , burst , etc . in stellar light curves . in this way",
    ", we will consider all the details of pile - up mechanism described in one parameter , which represents the fraction of counts lost by pile - up .",
    "finally , the models proposed in this work are essentially different to those that use the one photon approximation , in which it is assumed that not more than one photon can be measured per frame    @xcite .",
    "while this kind of models are devoted to obtain the probability to measure @xmath3 photons in @xmath4 frames ( being @xmath5 ) , the models proposed here follow the purpose to obtain the probability to have @xmath6 counts in only one frame . on the other hand ,",
    "the author has no notice of a previous study of the pile - up on a waiting - time probability distribution .",
    "a poisson process is a stochastic process in which events of a certain kind occur in time independently of one another . in the case analyzed here ,",
    "such events are the interactions of x - ray photons from a stellar source with the ccd detector of an x - ray telescope .",
    "a poisson process is described by one parameter : the rate of events in time ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "there are two parametric probability distributions usually used to describe poissonian processes : the poisson and the exponential distributions .",
    "the poisson distribution is defined as @xmath8 and gives the probability to have a number of detections @xmath6 in a time interval ( i.e. , a frame time of the instrument ) @xmath9 , if the rate of detections in time is @xmath7 .",
    "it is a discrete distribution , as @xmath6 can be any natural number or zero . from now on , @xmath9 is chosen as the time unit , so the poisson distribution results @xmath10 and @xmath7 will represent the mean number of detections per frame , if the measurement is repeated a large number of times with identical conditions .",
    "the exponential distribution is defined as @xmath11 and it is a probability density distribution , in the sense that @xmath12 gives the probability to have a waiting time of between @xmath13 and @xmath14 , where waiting time is the elapsed time between two consecutive detections .",
    "as the instrument reads at regular time steps @xmath9 , it is necessary to discretize the exponential distribution in order to use it to analyze a data set . using again @xmath9 as time unit , the probability to obtain a waiting time of @xmath15 ( or simply @xmath6 ) , where @xmath6 can be any natural number or zero , results @xmath16 where the factors in parenthesis are the probabilities of a waiting time of @xmath17 to be counted as @xmath6 or @xmath18 , being @xmath19 .",
    "equations ( [ eq : disc_exp_dist-1 ] ) can be easily integrated @xmath20 we will call this probability distribution _ discrete exponential distribution_.      when two or more photons arrive to the detector in the same frame , some of them could be collected on the same place on the ccd , and interpreted as a single count .",
    "this effect , which is called pile - up , provokes less counts than the number of collected photons . in this section ,",
    "probability distributions that consider pile - up are deduced .",
    "if 2 photons are collected by the ccd in the same frame , there are two possibilities : the second photon can result piled with the first one , or not . let us call @xmath21 to the probability of the first case , in which the result is only one count .",
    "the probability of the second case , where two counts result , is @xmath22 .",
    "similarly , if three photons are collected by the ccd in the same frame , there are three possibilities : two counts , one count or none can be lost .",
    "suppose that the second photon results piled with the first one which , as we have seen before , occurs with a probability of @xmath21 .",
    "when the third photon arrives , the probability of pile - up with the previous count , which was originated by two piled photons , is @xmath23 , and the probability of not , is @xmath24 . in the first case ,",
    "the result is only one count , and in the second , two counts .",
    "now suppose that the second photon does not result piled with the first one , which occurs with a probability of @xmath22 .",
    "then , when the third photon arrives , it can result piled with one of the others two , or not .",
    "we call @xmath25 to the probability of the first situation , in which the photon results piled with one of the two previous counts , each one originated by one photon , so @xmath26 is the probability of the second situation . in the first situation the result is two counts , and in the second one , three counts",
    "the idea can be easily generalized for any number .",
    "figure [ fig : tree ] shows a tree with the different paths of pile - up in which we can have @xmath6 counts from @xmath4 collected photons , up to @xmath27 . to calculate the probability of a particular path",
    ", we must start from the first column , and pass to the next going to the lower - right node in case of pile - up , or to the upper - right one if pile - up does not occur .",
    "we repeat this step until column @xmath4 , which represents the number of photons collected by the ccd .",
    "the numbers that label each node are the numbers @xmath6 of resulting counts .",
    "the probability of the path can be obtained multiplying the factors that are pointed out in the arrows that join the nodes . on this way ,",
    "the sum of the probabilities of all the possible paths that end in the same column is 1 .",
    "tree of pile - up possibilities .",
    "the column numbers ( top numbers ) are the numbers of photons collected by the ccd .",
    "the numbers on the nodes are the number of counts that the instrument records . for each node",
    ", there are different possible paths that end in it .",
    "the paths must start in the first node ( first column ) , and follow the arrows .",
    "the probability of the paths can be calculated multiplying the factors pointed out in the arrows . ]    to obtain a formula that expresses the probability of a particular path is not difficult .",
    "dividing that path in @xmath28 elementary steps that have a segment in the upper - right direction , followed by a segment in the lower - right direction , the probability can be expressed as @xmath29\\label{eq : poisson_pile - up_general}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 , and the increments on the even coefficients ( @xmath31 ) and odd coefficients ( @xmath32 ) are the numbers of nodes that are crossed in the upper - right and the lower - right directions in the @xmath33 step .",
    "if the path starts in the lower - right direction , the first step does not have the upper - right segment , and @xmath34 is 0 . if the path ends in the upper - right direction , the last step does not have the segment in the lower - right direction , and @xmath35 is 0 .",
    "the other increments must be positive numbers .",
    "equation ( [ eq : poisson_pile - up_general ] ) is general but too complicated to be useful for pile - up probability calculation .",
    "let us make an assumption to simplify it : let us suppose that @xmath36    assumption ( [ eq : assumption_0 ] ) considers that the pile - up probability of a photon that is collected by the ccd only depends on how many counts are already in the frame , but not on if in these counts some of the previous collected photons resulted piled .    to calculate the distribution that gives the probability to obtain @xmath6 counts considering that the collected photons follow a poisson distribution",
    ", we must add the probabilities of all the nodes @xmath6 .",
    "the probability of every node is obtained multiplying the probability @xmath37 for the column of the node ( where @xmath4 is the number of collected photons and @xmath38 is the poisson distribution ( [ eq : poisson_dist ] ) ) , and the probability obtained adding the probabilities of all the paths that end in that node . after some combinatorial work , the result is @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the @xmath33 element of the m - tuple @xmath41 of the set of the m - tuples of @xmath42 , considering no permutations .",
    "formula ( [ eq : pile - up_poisson_1 ] ) is valid for @xmath43 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath44 is equal to @xmath45 .",
    "the fraction @xmath46 of lost counts with respect to the total number of collected photons results @xmath47    it is possible to go forward making another assumption on @xmath48 . for a low ratio of counts per frame with respect to the total number of pixels used to acquire the data ( i.e. far from saturation ) , it is a reasonable assumption to take @xmath49 this assumption considers that the pile - up probability is proportional to the number of previous counts in the frame . with it , and after more combinatorial work , equation ( [ eq : pile - up_poisson_1 ] ) results @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the stirling number of second kind .",
    "again , formula ( [ eq : pile - up_poisson_2 ] ) is valid for @xmath43 . for @xmath52 ,",
    "the probability is @xmath45 . in this work ,",
    "this probability distribution is called _ poisson distribution with pile - up _ , despite it is not general .",
    "it is to note that probability distribution ( [ eq : pile - up_poisson_2 ] ) is not a stuttering - poisson distribution @xcite . for a stuttering - poisson distribution ,",
    "the probability to obtain the case @xmath6 from the case @xmath4 distributed as poisson , is obtained from the convolution of @xmath4 indentically distributed random variables .",
    "but for distribution ( [ eq : pile - up_poisson_2 ] ) , the conditional probability @xmath53 is obtained by adding the probabilities of all the possible paths of pile - up , being the probabilities of each step of the paths dependant on the collection history , that is , on the number of counts that already are in the frame .",
    "so , the process of photon collection with pile - up is not stuttering - poisson , and the probability distribution ( [ eq : pile - up_poisson_2 ] ) is not a member of the stuttering - poisson class .",
    "an important feature of the function that gives the probability to obtain @xmath6 counts from @xmath4 collected photons defined in equation ( [ eq : pile - up_poisson_2 ] ) @xmath54 is that it produces alternativelly negative and positive numbers when @xmath6 is increased beyond certain value which we call @xmath55 .",
    "these values do not correspond to physical probabilities and must be considered as zero , as they are related to the complete saturation of the instrument .",
    "the last positive value must be corrected in order to satisfy the normalization condition @xmath56    figure [ fig : p_asterix ] shows the graphics of @xmath57 in function of @xmath7 and @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is obtained evaluating equation ( [ eq : pile - up_poisson_2 ] ) in @xmath55 . as we will see in section [ sec : simulation_tests ] , this procedure is not suitable when @xmath60 but , as we can see in figure [ fig : p_asterix ] , it only occurs when @xmath7 and @xmath58 are large .",
    "@xmath57 in function of @xmath7 and @xmath58 .",
    "this is the first negative value of equation ( [ eq : pile - up_poisson_2 ] ) .",
    "this value and the successive ones must be considered as zero , and the previous one must be corrected in order to preserve the normalization condition . ]    finally , applying assumption ( [ eq : assumption ] ) to equation ( [ eq : pile_up_poisson_missed_1 ] ) , and considering its taylor expansion , it can be proved that the fraction @xmath46 of lost counts with respect to the total number of collected photons results @xmath61 from equation ( [ eq : pile_up_poisson_missed_2 ] ) we can find the highest possible value of @xmath46 in function of @xmath7 taking @xmath62 @xmath63      in this case , when a number @xmath3 of photons result piled , there is a missing of @xmath64 waiting times equal to 0 in the data set , while the numbers of waiting times different to 0 are the same as they would be if pile - up were null .",
    "calling @xmath46 to the fraction of lost counts by the pile - up , and considering equation ( [ eq : disc_exp_dist ] ) , the probability distribution of waiting times taking in account the pile - up results @xmath65 we will call _ discrete exponential distribution with pile - up _ to probability distribution ( [ eq : pile - up_discrete ] ) .",
    "we can see that @xmath66 is a non negative number only if @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the same previously found for the poisson distribution with pile - up , equation ( [ eq : xmax ] ) .",
    "probability distributions like ( [ eq : pile - up_poisson_2 ] ) or ( [ eq : pile - up_discrete ] ) express , if a measure is made , the probability to obtain any of the different cases labeled as @xmath6 .",
    "probability distributions also express the fractions of cases @xmath6 that would be obtained if an infinite number of measures could be made .",
    "but the number of measures that can be made is finite so , in general , the fractions @xmath69 of the cases @xmath6 with respect to the total , differ from the probability distribution @xmath70 , being the differences due to chance .",
    "now the typical expected differences , which are called statistical errors , are estimated .",
    "if the probability of happening for the case @xmath6 in a measure is @xmath70 , then the probability of not happening is @xmath71 .",
    "if the experiment is repeated @xmath4 times , the probability to obtain @xmath72 times the case @xmath6 can be estimated through the binomial distribution .",
    "the most probable number of times in which the event @xmath6 occurs is @xmath73 , being the variance @xmath74 . as @xmath4 usually is a large number ,",
    "there is not a significant difference between the binomial distribution and the normal distribution with the same mean value and variance . from this",
    ", we can estimate the typical differences between data statistics @xmath75 with respect to their most probable expected values @xmath70 through the standard errors of the related normal distributions , that is , the square roots of the variances @xmath76    equation ( [ eq : simple_error ] ) is good enough to estimate the statistical errors for @xmath77 @xcite . in that case",
    ", it is expected that @xmath78 be less than @xmath79 for the 68 % of the cases , less than @xmath80 for the 95% of the cases , and less than @xmath81 for the 99.7% of the cases .",
    "in sections [ sub : poisson_pile - up ] and [ sub : exponential_pile - up ] two probability distributions able to describe the statistics of data sets of counts obtained from an intrinsic poissonian process , like the arrival of photons to an x - ray telescope focal plane , measured by an instrument which shows pile - up , like a ccd , were deduced .",
    "now , the problem of how to find the set of parameters that make the best fit of a probability distribution ( statistical model ) with respect to the statistics of a given data set is treated .",
    "consider the probability distribution @xmath82 that could be ( [ eq : pile - up_poisson_2 ] ) or ( [ eq : pile - up_discrete ] ) , so @xmath83 represents @xmath58 or @xmath46 . to find the best fitting parameters ,",
    "the least squares method can be used .",
    "this method consists of finding the values of the parameters that minimize the quantity @xmath84 where @xmath79 is given by equation ( [ eq : simple_error ] ) .",
    "the upper limit of the sum , @xmath85 , which in theory is infinity , in practice is a number that satisfies , on one hand , that @xmath86 for @xmath87 , and on the other , that @xmath88 , being @xmath4 the number of elements of the data set .",
    "if the probability distribution used to fit the data statistics is able to describe them , then the statistics of @xmath89 defined in equation ( [ eq : ji_square ] ) must be chi - square distributed , with @xmath90 degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "this is a consequence of the normally and independently distributed statistical errors of equation ( [ eq : simple_error ] ) .    to determine the statistical errors of the coefficients @xmath91 ,",
    "the taylor expansion of @xmath89 around its minimum is used @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the hessian of @xmath94 , and its components are equal to @xcite @xmath95    if @xmath96 , the variance of the parameters result @xmath97 @xmath98 the square roots of these quantities ( @xmath99 and @xmath100 ) are the standard errors of the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath83 estimated through the least squares method .",
    "now , let us consider the effective rate of counts @xmath101 measured by the instrument .",
    "it is related to @xmath7 and @xmath46 through @xmath102    equation ( [ eq : alpha - r - equation ] ) is useful to check the consistency of the results , and it can also be used to improve the estimations of @xmath7 and @xmath46 . as ( [ eq : alpha - r - equation ] ) permits to obtain @xmath103 and @xmath104 , it is possible to promediate @xmath7 with @xmath103 and @xmath46 with @xmath104 , with relative weights according to their statistical errors @xcite .",
    "calling @xmath105 and @xmath106 to these corrected values , they result @xmath107 @xmath108 where @xmath109 and @xmath110 are the standard errors of @xmath105 and @xmath106 @xmath111 @xmath112    for the case of the discrete exponential distribution with pile - up ( [ eq : pile - up_discrete ] ) , @xmath46 and @xmath113 are obtained directly from least squares method and equation ( [ eq : sigma_s ] ) , because @xmath46 is one of the parameters of the distribution .",
    "but , for the case of the poisson distribution with pile - up ( [ eq : pile - up_poisson_2 ] ) , @xmath46 is a function of parameters @xmath7 and @xmath58 , so @xmath113 must be obtained propagating the errors @xmath99 and @xmath114 in the function ( [ eq : pile_up_poisson_missed_2 ] ) @xmath115",

    "it is because a very low flux of photons from the source out of this range is expected .      as the luminosity of",

    "the analysis of the data sets with the probability distributions were made by searching the parameters that make the best fitting of them on the corresponding statistics of the data sets .",

    "although there are a large number of cases in which the fittings are good , there are a significative number of situations in which the fittings are not satisfactory .",
    "this behaviour points out that the model of the poisson distribution with pile - up is more restrictive than the model of the discrete exponential distribution with pile - up , in the sense that there are sets of data whose statistics can be described by de second one , but not by the first one .",
    "the tests with simulated data show that the poisson distribution with pile - up and the discrete exponential distribution with pile - up do not describe different aspects of the same phenomenon , as the poisson and exponential distribution do for a poisson process , in the sense that statistics of sets of data stochastically generated with one of them can be described by the other one and vice versa .",
    "in fact , the discrete exponential distribution with pile - up is able to describe the statistics of a set of data stochastically generated through the poisson distribution with pile - up for a wide domain , but the opposite is not true .",
    "it has a simple explanation : while the model used for the formulation of the discrete exponential distribution with pile - up only assumes that a fraction of waiting times equal to 0 is lost ( which basically is the fundamental feature of pile - up phenomenon ) , the poisson distribution with pile - up proposed here relies on two arbitrary assumptions ( equations [ eq : assumption_0 ] and [ eq : assumption ] ) which are expected to be good aproximations to the behaviour of real detectors for low values of @xmath7 and @xmath58 , but they could be replaced by other ones and still satisfying the model of the discrete exponential distribution with pile - up .",
    "so , the discrete exponential distribution with pile - up corresponds to a more general model , and it is able to describe the statistics of a whole class of models which includes the corresponding to the poisson distribution with pile - up presented in this paper .",
    "in this paper , two different probability distributions for the description of statistics of data obtained from measurements of a poissonian process by an instrument that presents pile - up are deduced .",
    "these probability distributions give the probability to have a number of counts per time bin , or a certain waiting time between consecutive counts , and they were deduced from the poisson and the exponential distributions .",
    "we call these probability distributions poisson distribution with pile - up and discrete exponential distribution with pile - up .    a general form of the poisson distribution with pile - up is complicated , because it must depend on several parameters , some of them impossed by the instrument used in data acquisition and the photon energy spectrum .",
    "but , through two assumptions , which are expected to be good approximations for low rates of photon collection , a simple analytical expression depending on only two parameters can be obtained ( equation [ eq : pile - up_poisson_2 ] ) , being this expression independent from instrument features .",
    "these parameters represent the rate of collected photons per time ( @xmath7 ) , and the probability of pile - up of a collected photon with a previous count ( @xmath58 ) . but its validity depends on the validity of the assumptions , so it is not general .    the discrete exponential distribution with pile - up results very simple .",
    "the obtained formula depends on only two parameters : @xmath7 ( the mean number of collected photons per time bin ) and @xmath46 ( the fraction of lost counts ) from the beginning , so no extra assumptions were needed .",
    "then , this distribution results to be general , and so , valid for any pile - up situation over a poissonian process . in that sense , the discrete exponential distribution with pile - up is more simple and robust than the poisson distribution with pile - up . nevertheless , in x - ray data analysis",
    ", the poisson distribution is widely used , but the exponential distribution , rarely is .",
    "to check the validity of the probability distributions presented here , first , they were fitted to the same data set using the least squares method , and their results were analyzed and compared .",
    "to do that , a set of real astronomical data was used .",
    "it was obtained from the isolated neutron star rx j0720.4 - 3125 by epic pn instrument at xmm - newton observatory .",
    "the fittings on the statistics of data result very good for both distributions , and the estimations of the mean rates of photon collection , and the fraction of lost counts , result consistent and practically coincident .",
    "so , it can be concluded that the proposed probability distributions are valid to describe the statistics of the data of this particular observation , and it is reasonable to think that they can be valid to describe other cases similar to this .",
    "also , the two probability distributions were tested between them through numerical simulations .",
    "to do that , one of them was used to generate sets of data for different values of parameters , and the other probability distribution was fitted to the statistics of the data sets , in order to find the values of its parameters that describe them best .",
    "then , the values of parameters obtained fitting the second probability distribution were compared to the parameters used in the simulation with the first probability distribution , and the consistency between both models was analyzed . both distributions were used in simulations and analysis , and the results show that discrete exponential distribution with pile - up is able to describe the statistics of data sets generated by the poisson distribution with pile - up , but the opposite is not true .",
    "we conclude that the poisson distribution with pile - up is less general than the discrete exponential distribution with pile - up .",
    "this result is consistent with the fact that the model of the poisson distribution with pile - up relies on two arbitrary assumptions , but the model of the discrete exponential distribution with pile - up does not .",
    "so , while the discrete exponential distribution with pile - up seems to be a very general model able to describe practically any pile - up situation , the validity of the poisson distribution with pile - up depends on the accuracy of the assumptions ( [ eq : assumption_0 ] ) and ( [ eq : assumption ] ) .",
    "a detailed study of when the poisson distribution with pile - up presented here is accurate enough to describe a particular situation , is out of the scope of the present work , because to determine the pertinence of the assumptions that it uses , it is necessary to consider in detail the pile - up mechanisms like the grade migration , which depend on the instrumental characteristics and the photon energy spectrum .",
    "but as we saw in section [ sec : aplication ] , both probability distributions fit remarkably well on the statistics of the real x - ray astronomical data used in this work , so we can infer that they must be able to describe the statistics of other similar real data sets .",
    "finally , it is to note that the probability distributions proposed in this paper could be useful to improve some current statistical methods for x - ray astronomy data analysis that consider the poisson distribution as the background statistical model .",
    "the poisson distribution with pile - up deduced in this work results very simple , and could easily replace the poisson distribution in some of these methods .",
