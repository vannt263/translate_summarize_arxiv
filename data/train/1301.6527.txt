    "radio supernovae ( sne ) result from the collision between a supernova shock and the progenitor s circumstellar medium ( csm ) .",
    "as the interaction between the propagating blast wave and the csm drives the particle acceleration process , supernova remnants ( snrs ) are natural laboratories for studying particle spectra and their variation in time ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "supernova 1987a in the large magellanic cloud , as the only nearby core - collapse supernova observed to date , has provided a unique opportunity to study the evolution of the sn - csm interaction in young radio remnants .",
    "the complex csm distribution in the snr is believed to have originated from a red supergiant ( rsg ) which has evolved into a blue supergiant ( bsg ) about 20,000 years before the explosion @xcite .",
    "models of the progenitor evolution suggest that the equatorially denser , i.e.  slower , rsg wind ( @xcite ) was swept up by the faster bsg wind @xcite , thus forming high density rings .",
    "in particular , beside the central circular ring in the equatorial plane ( _ equatorial ring _ , er ) , observations with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) have also revealed two outer rings that formed from the mass loss of the progenitor star , located on either side of the equatorial plane ( @xcite ) , which confer to snr 1987a a peculiar triple - ring nebula structure .",
    "since the radio detection of the remnant in mid-1990 @xcite , the synchrotron emission has been generated by the shock wave propagating into the ring - shaped distribution of the csm in the equatorial plane .",
    "monitoring of the flux density has been regularly undertaken with the molonglo observatory synthesis telescope ( most ) at 843 mhz and at 1.4 , 2.4 , 4.8 and 8.6 ghz with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) @xcite .",
    "atca observations have been ongoing for @xmath625 years ( @xcite ) .",
    "an exponential increase of the flux density has been measured at all frequencies since day @xmath65000 after the explosion , which is likely due to an increasing efficiency of the acceleration process of particles by the shock front @xcite .",
    "the morphology of the non - thermal radiation emitted by relativistic electrons accelerated in the remnant , has been investigated using images at 9 ghz since 1992 @xcite , with a spatial resolution of 05 achieved via maximum entropy super - resolution ( @xcite ) .",
    "these images have provided the first insight into the marked east - west asymmetry of the radio emission . as receivers operating in the 12 mm band ( 1626 ghz ) were introduced at the atca in 2001 , the first imaging observations at 18 ghz were undertaken in 2003 july , at an effective resolution of 045 @xcite .",
    "very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) observations of the snr were successful in 2007 october @xcite and 2008 november @xcite at 1.4 and 1.7 ghz , respectively .",
    "these observations provided the first images with @xmath7 resolution , but with low sensitivity and dynamic range . nevertheless , the vlbi images captured the presence of small - scale structures in bright regions @xcite . at the same time , atca observations at 36 ghz in 2008 april and october resulted in high - dynamic range images with an angular resolution of 03 @xcite .",
    "the 36 ghz images , in combination with the 9 ghz observations at similar epochs , were used to construct the first spectral index image of the snr , with a resolution of @xmath8 .",
    "the resultant map provided the first glimpse into the spatial variations of the synchrotron spectral index across the remnant , and hinted at the possible association between flatter spectral indices and the bright sites in both lobes . after the atca upgrade in mid-2009 with the compact array broadband backend ( cabb ) ( wilson et al .",
    "2011 ) , the remnant was imaged at higher frequencies .",
    "the first resolved image at 94 ghz was produced from observations between 2011 june and august @xcite .",
    "comparison of the 94 ghz image with data at 9 ghz yielded a low - resolution spectral index map , with a much larger region of flatter spectral index on the eastern lobe than on the western lobe .",

    "the observations at 18 ghz were performed on 2011 january 26 with the atca in 6a configuration , in two bands , each of 2-ghz width , centred on 17 and 19 ghz .",
    "atmospheric conditions were exceptional during both the 44 ghz sessions with rms of the path length fluctuations below 250 @xmath9 m , thus confirming that phase stability conditions at the atca can be met not only in winter but also in spring and summer nights @xcite .",

    "( 2009 ) .",
    "the miriad data reduction package was used to process all datasets .",
    "for the 44 ghz observations , the task atfix was first used to apply corrections to the system temperatures , instrumental phases and baseline lengths .",
    "the january and november datasets were imaged , clean - ed @xcite and self - calibrated separately before being combined . in particular ,",
    "the preliminary clean model was constructed by using 400 iterations for the january dataset and 180 for the november dataset .",
    "phase self - calibration was performed on the separate datasets and on the combined data , over a 2-minute solution interval . for imaging , a weighting parameter of robust",
    "= 0.5 @xcite was used .",
    "deconvolution of the combined data was performed with the maximum entropy method ( mem ) @xcite .",
    "the mem model of the combined data led to diffraction - limited image resolution of @xmath0 with a moderate dynamic range ( @xmath6165 ) .",
    "the diffraction - limited image was then slightly super - resolved using a @xmath1 circular beam .",
    "figure  [ fig:44_images ] shows the combined stokes - i continuum image derived from the january and november observations before and after super - resolution .",
    "the image yields an integrated flux density for the snr of @xmath14 mjy at day 8886 after the explosion , where the rms error in the image and the flux density uncertainty are added in quadrature . in stokes - q , u and v images , the source is not detected .",
    "the @xmath15 upper limits to the flux densities are 60 @xmath16jy beam@xmath17 or 2% of the maximum stokes - i flux density .",
    "the data from the 18 ghz observations were flagged , then split into the separate observing bands until the imaging and deconvolution steps , so as to account for frequency - dependent terms in the calibration step .",
    "phase self - calibration was performed over a 2-minute solution interval , which gave sufficient s / n ratio . as for the reduction procedure of the 44 ghz data , the weighting parameter robust",
    "was set at 0.5 and , after data deconvolution via mem , the resulting image was restored with the diffraction - limited beam of half - maximum size @xmath18 .",
    "because of the high s / n , a super - resolved image was also obtained by restoring the mem model with a @xmath1 circular beam , as @xcite have shown that this degree of super - resolution gives reliable images .",
    "the diffraction - limited and super - resolved versions of the stokes - i continuum 18 ghz image of snr 1987a , as derived at day 8738 since the explosion , are shown in figure  [ fig:18_image ] .",
    "the image gives an integrated flux density for the snr of @xmath19 mjy .",
    "the image parameters are summarised in table  [ tab02 ] .",
    "the emission at 44 ghz appears to be mainly distributed in an elliptical ring , with brightness peaking on the eastern lobe .",
    "the east - west asymmetry of the radio emission is a characteristic of snr 1987a , which has emerged since the first atca images @xcite , and has been monitored via the super - resolved atca images at 9 ghz ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter n08 ) .",
    "this asymmetry has been confirmed in atca observations at 18 , 36 and 94 ghz ( @xcite ) .",
    "slices through the 44 ghz image at six position angles are shown in figure  [ fig:44_profiles ] .",
    "the brightness of the eastern lobe peaks between the radial profiles at 60@xmath20 and 90@xmath20 , while the ratio of the profile maxima corresponding to the brightness peaks of the eastern and western lobes , is @xmath61.5 .",
    "overall , the eastern half of the image appears significantly brighter than the western one , with a ratio of @xmath61.6 between the integrated flux densities of the two regions , i.e. east and west of the geometric centre , approximately located @xmath675 mas east of the vlbi position of the sn @xcite [ ra @xmath21 , dec @xmath22 ( j2000 ) ] .",
    "this emission ratio is higher than the @xmath23 obtained at 9 ghz ( n08 ) and the @xmath24 measured at 36 ghz @xcite , via fitting the images with an equatorial belt torus characterised by a west - east linear gradient of the brightness distribution ( see n08 ) .",
    "the profiles also show a possible third peak slightly west of the centre of the remnant , which reaches maximum in the 120@xmath20 slice , at @xmath25 of the brightness peak of the western lobe .",
    "the overall emission from this central region is @xmath26 mjy , thus making @xmath27 of the total integrated flux density .    in figure  [ fig:44_2008 - 2011 ] ,",
    "the 44 ghz image is compared to the 2008 observations at 36 ghz ( see table  [ tab03 ] ) .",
    "the remnant expansion over the 4-year time frame is noticeable from the contours of the peak flux density at identical levels .",
    "a total integrated flux density of @xmath28 mjy is derived by scaling the flux density of the 36 ghz image to that associated with the remnant at 44 ghz at the same epoch , as @xmath29 results at day 7815 from the spectral index function that fits observations between 1.4 and 8.6 ghz ( see figure 7 in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this leads to a yearly flux density increase of @xmath30 , which is higher than the @xmath31 per year derived at 8.6 ghz by @xcite , from monitoring observations between year 20 and 21 .    in figure",
    "[ fig:44_3cm - model ] , the 44 ghz image is compared with that derived by fitting the n08 inclined - torus model to the 9 ghz observations performed in 2011 april 22 ( ng et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the fitted model has a radius of @xmath32 , which surpasses by @xmath667 mas that used to fit the 36 ghz image in 2008 @xcite .",
    "the flux of the 9 ghz model is scaled to that corresponding at 44 ghz , via the spectral index @xmath33 , which is extrapolated from contemporaneous atca observations spanning from 1.4 to 94 ghz ( see figure  [ fig : spectral_index ] ) .",
    "the resultant model image , as shown in figure  [ fig:44_3cm - model ] , has a total integrated flux density of @xmath34 mjy and the restoring beam of the diffraction - limited image at 44 ghz .",
    "the residual between the model and the actual visibilities demonstrates that the model matches the observations along the profile at pa 90@xmath20 , where the ratio of the brightness peaks between the two lobes equals the @xmath35 measured in the observations .",
    "the residual visibilities peak on the eastern lobe at pa 30@xmath20 and 150@xmath20 , since the new observations exhibit more extended bright regions than what reproduced by the linear gradient of the modelled flux distribution .",
    "the linear gradient assumption also constrains the ratio of the integrated flux density over the eastern and western halves of the image , to @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , the n08 model , which fits well the radio remnant as seen at 9 ghz , might not be applicable to the large - scale emission morphology that emerges from the 44 ghz observations .      in the diffraction - limited image , the emission at 18 ghz looks primarily ring - shaped , while a secondary structure seems to emerge from the super - resolved image ( see figure  [ fig:18_image ] ) .",
    "two arm - like features appear to stem from the northern and southern edges of the major ellipsoidal structure of the emission , peaking at pa 0@xmath20 , and extending towards the western side of the remnant . while these features suggest a double - ring formation within the snr , they might more likely be noise artefacts of the super - resolution process .    in terms of remnant asymmetry , at 18 ghz the radial profiles in figure  [ fig:18_profiles ] show that the asymmetry peaks on the eastern lobe between pa 60@xmath20 and 90@xmath20 .",
    "the asymmetry ratio between the eastern and western brightness peaks is @xmath23 , and a similar ratio is obtained from the ratio between the flux density integrated over the eastern and western halves of the image .",
    "this value matches the asymmetry ratio derived by n08 from @xmath36 data at 9 ghz .    in figure  [ fig:18_2003 - 2011 ] ,",

    "* table  [ tab03 ] ) .",
    "the morphology similarities between the 2003 and 2011 images emphasise the significant expansion of the remnant over 8 years .",
    "slices through the 2011 image indicate that the central emission varies from 20% to 24% of the brightness on the eastern lobe .",

    "from 1987 to 1992 , i.e.  in the early stages of the snr , the remnant had an expansion velocity of @xmath6 30,000 km s@xmath17 @xcite .",
    "when the radio emission re - emerged , this was followed by a drastic deceleration to 3000 km s@xmath17 @xcite . from 1992 to 2008 , the expansion has been determined from the radius of the 9 ghz images fitted via a torus model , with a resultant velocity of 4000@xmath2400 km s@xmath17 from @xmath6day 1800 to day 7620 ( n08 ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : expansion ] , the expansion of the remnant at 18 and 44 ghz is estimated as the change over time of the distance between the vlbi position of the sn @xcite and the mean position of the peak of brightness for the eastern and western lobes , as derived from the emission profile at pa 90@xmath20 centred on the sn coordinates .",
    "comparison between observations at 18 ghz at day 6003 and 8738 , gives a velocity of 4100 km s@xmath17 ( blue line ) , while the comparison between the 36 and 44 ghz datasets , within the 20082011 time frame , leads to a velocity of 3900 km s@xmath17 ( purple line ) .",
    "an identical result of @xmath55 km s@xmath17 is obtained if the 2011 dataset at 18 ghz is included in the fit of data between 2008 and 2011 , since the 18 ghz measurements align with those at 36 and 44 ghz .",
    "all fits are consistent with the 9 ghz results .    with reference to the sn position , it should be noted that both the datasets at 18 ghz ( 20032011 ) , and the datasets at 36 ghz ( 2008 ) and 44 ghz ( 2011 ) , show an asymmetric expansion of the remnant , with a larger increase of the distances between the sn position and that of the brightness peak on the eastern lobe , compared to the western side .",
    "the asymmetry in the expansion has been noted since the images at 9 ghz in early epochs @xcite , where an asymmetry in the initial expansion of the sn ejecta has been proposed as the explanation for the fact that the eastern lobe is located further than the western one from the sn site . in the case of the 18 ghz datasets ,",
    "an expansion velocity of 5900 km s@xmath17 is derived for the eastern lobe , while 2300 km s@xmath17 is the expansion velocity of the western brightness peak .",

    "the expansion velocity of the remnant western lobe is 1900@xmath2400 km s@xmath17 , while that of the eastern lobe is 6100@xmath2200 km s@xmath17 .",
    "while these values are affected by some uncertainty in identifying the location of the remnant with respect to the vlbi coordinates of the sn site , the results from the 18 , 36 and 44 ghz data imply that the expansion velocity of the eastern lobe is significantly larger than that of the western lobe .",
    "therefore , a marked asymmetry of the remnant emerges not only in terms of brightness distribution of the radio emission but also in terms of remnant expansion .",
    "spectral index maps allow the examination of the spatial variations of the spectral index , @xmath5 ( where @xmath56 ) , across the remnant and , therefore , of the electron acceleration processes associated with the propagation of the blast wave .",
    "the 2011 observations at 18 and 44 ghz have been used to derive a map of the distribution of the spectral index in the snr . to match the @xmath57 coverage of the 18 ghz observations , the visibilities from baselines greater than 400 k@xmath58 were filtered out in the 44 ghz datasets . at both frequencies ,",
    "the images have been derived using an identical reduction procedure . in particular , identical weighting parameters , deconvolution algorithm and phase self - calibration iterations",
    "were applied to both datasets .",
    "it should be noted that the self - calibration technique , while improving the image resolution , removes all absolute positional information .",
    "therefore , the astrometry of each image was compared with that prior to self - calibration and the images were shifted to align with recent vlbi observations of the remnant ( zanardo et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "this process allowed us to accurately place the position of the remnant with respect to the vlbi position of the sn mentioned in   [ morphology ] .",
    "the aligned images were then restored with a @xmath59 circular beam and regridded at a pixel scale of 3 mas .      to verify that any claimed spectral index variations have not been artificially generated by the data reduction and/or are tied to a particular spectral mapping technique , the spectral index distribution within the remnant is reconstructed via three different methods : ( _ i _ ) spectral tomography ( @xmath60 ) ; ( _ ii _ ) flux ratio ( @xmath61 ) ; ( _ iii _ ) temperature - temperature ( or t - t ) plots ( @xmath62 ) .    with the method of spectral tomography @xcite , a difference image , @xmath63 , is calculated by scaling the 44 ghz image by a trial spectral index , @xmath60 , and subtracting it from the 18 ghz image , as it follows : @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the images at frequency @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively .",
    "when @xmath60 reaches the actual spectral index of a particular feature , the feature vanishes in the local background of the difference image . on the other hand , if a component has spectral index greater or smaller than @xmath60 , the difference image appears with a distinctively positive or negative residual compared to the local background , as this component will get over or under - subtracted .",
    "the second method used to construct a spectral index map is that of direct image division , being @xmath69 . as this method is sensitive to variations in background / foreground emission that might cause spatial changes in the observed spectral index , it is not usually the preferred method to investigate the spectral index distribution over large snrs @xcite .    to validate the results from the flux density ratio @xmath70 ,",
    "the spectral variations over small regions within the remnant are also assessed from the flux slope @xmath71 , where @xmath72 .",
    "this approach was first applied by @xcite and @xcite to data of very low angular resolution , where instead of fluxes , the brightness temperatures , @xmath73 , are plotted at two frequencies , and the spectral index is derived from the best fitting line of the plotted points ( thus referred to as temperature - temperature or t - t plot ) .",
    "the slope of the best - fitting line to the @xmath74 points derived for each pixel of the images at 18 and 44 ghz ( @xmath75 and @xmath76 ) , within a specific region , yields the spectral index @xmath62 of that region . while small differences in the background levels cause spreading of the plotted t - t points , because of the intrinsic spatial averaging of the linear regression method , the regional @xmath62 values are less affected than @xmath61 by zero - level data ( @xcite ) .",

    "the spectral index gradually steepens towards the edges , with the northern and southern regions becoming over - subtracted at @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively . for the bright regions on the eastern lobe of the remnant , sites within the contours at 90% of the peak flux density ( see figure  [ fig : spectral_18 - 44_tomography ] )",

    "the entire bright area on the eastern lobe is over - subtracted for @xmath88 .",
    "on the western lobe , sites within the 60% contours have a wider range than on the eastern lobe , as @xmath60 varies from @xmath89 to @xmath85 with a north - south gradient .",
    "southern regions in the tomography maps disappear into the background for @xmath90 , with larger errors on sites close to the edges of the 10% flux density contour of the 44 ghz image .",
    "larger spectral index variations can be seen in the n - nw sites , with @xmath91 .",
    "the sites that can be associated with spectral index @xmath92 correspond to flux density at 44 ghz close to zero and , therefore , are more affected by error in the image subtraction .    the spectral index map , as derived from the direct division of the images at 44 and 18 ghz , is shown in figure  [ fig : spectral_18 - 44_divide ] .",
    "it can be seen that the spectral indices primarily vary in the range @xmath93 .",
    "in particular , on the eastern lobe , within the 90% contours of the peak flux density at both 18 and 44 ghz , @xmath93 , while slightly steeper values , @xmath94 , correspond with the western brightest sites . on both lobes , near the northern edge of the 60% contours , the spectral indices peak at @xmath95 on the eastern sites and @xmath96 on the western ones .",

    "it is noted that the regions at the edges of the @xmath61 map , i.e.  @xmath98 ( in dark - blue and black ) and @xmath99 ( in light - blue and white ) are likely affected by higher uncertainty , since these values are associated with lower s / n ratios in either the 44 or 18 ghz images .",
    "the effects of low s / n on the @xmath61 distribution can be assessed from the histogram of the spectral indices over the entire map . in figure",

    "p _ is the scalar momentum , in the scenario of ordinary diffusion , @xmath156 is the spectrum of the western side of the snr , while @xmath157 is obtained for region e1 .    the lower compression ratio in region e1 could correspond with the asymmetric expansion observed in the remnant , which appears to be driven by higher eastern velocities ( see   [ expansion ] ) . as @xmath158 @xcite , where @xmath159 and @xmath160 are the downstream and upstream gas densities , respectively , a lower compression ratio over the eastern brightest sites could be due to the higher - velocity shock drifting the cosmic rays ( cr ) upstream .",
    "the cr diffusion could induce gas heating upstream of the shock @xcite and , thus , a higher upstream pressure .",
    "if the snr magnetic field is tangled rather than uniform @xcite , the softer spectrum could be the result of local sub - diffusive particle transport , as the accelerated particles get partially trapped in the vicinity of the shock front by structures in the magnetic field @xcite . in this case , the particle spectrum corresponding to region e1 would be steeper than for diffusive transport , with @xmath161 , where @xmath162 @xcite .",
    "the softer spectrum in e1 likely implies that a lower fraction of injected particles , i.e.  a higher injection efficiency , is required for the high emission observed in the eastern region .",
    "if the stronger eastbound shock is coupled with a more efficient particle acceleration , the magnetic - field on the eastern lobe might become locally amplified ( @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , according to @xcite , with efficient cr acceleration , @xmath163 , where @xmath164 and @xmath165 are the background and fluctuating magnetic fields , respectively , and @xmath166 is the mach number of the shock .",
    "thus , a higher @xmath166 would likely induce non - linear amplifications of the magnetic field generated in the snr .",
    "as the magnetic - field amplification depends on the magnetic field orientation , it can be noted that in asymmetric bipolar ( or bilateral ) remnants , such as snr 1987a , regions of higher emission have been linked to either quasi - parallel or quasi - perpendicular magnetic field inclinations ( @xcite ) .    as regards the @xmath62 results in the northern and southern parts of the snr , adjacent small - scale features of both steeper and flatter spectra , lead to spectral indices flatter than @xmath147 in the s2 and n2 regions , while the values derived for regions n1 and s1 seem still dominated by the steeper indices associated with the bright sites on the eastern lobe .",
    "we note that , overall , the spectral indices over the high - emissivity regions are steeper than predicted by first - order fermi acceleration at a strong shock .",

    "spectral index gradients in older and larger snrs have been explained as due to multiple overlapping spectral index structures ( @xcite ) . according to hydrodynamic simulations coupled to dsa by @xcite of a spherical snr",
    ", a spectral gradient might reflect a spectral index structure over multiple concentric shells of shocked material within the forward and the reverse shocks , with a cr population varying between the concentric shells , such that the spectral index results flatter on the outer shell than on the inner ones .",
    "the scenario of sub - diffusive transport of particles at the shock front , also leads to small - scale spectral gradients in the downstream plasma , which would correspond to the transition between sub - diffusive and diffusive behaviour of the particle propagation @xcite .",
    "all methods used for spectral analysis show two inner regions of flatter spectral indices , where @xmath168 and @xmath169 . the more central feature , which overlaps with the sn site ( see figure  [ fig : spectral_18 - 44_divide ] ) , has @xmath170 , @xmath171 and @xmath172 . the second feature , located further north , can be associated with @xmath173 and @xmath174 , while the corresponding @xmath62 , between regions n1 and n2 , is affected by the nearby steeper spectra .",

    "it can be seen that the central feature of flatter electron spectrum , not only coincides with the inner region of fainter emission that is visible in the radio at higher resolution , but also partially overlaps with the western side of the optical ejecta .",

    ". nevertheless , since it corresponds to a site characterised by high flux density both at 18 and 44 ghz , the related @xmath60 and @xmath61 values are unlikely affected by significant error .    while pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) in the radio band",
    "are identified by @xmath175 @xcite , the acceleration origin in the above discussed features of @xmath176 , could be explained in terms of injection by a pulsar .",
    "further observations at high frequencies and monitoring of any morphology changes is required to clarify the nature of these features .",
    "as shown in early models of type ii snrs @xcite , the sn - csm interaction in snr 1987a has generated a main double - shock structure , which includes , from the outside inwards , the forward shock and the reverse shock . between the forward and reverse shocks , reflected shocks should be present due to the forward blast wave encountering the high - density csm in the er @xcite .",
    "while the structure of the shock can be probed by comparing the remnant morphology in the radio and x - ray wavelengths , the distribution of the progenitor dense material can be investigated via h@xmath5 images .",
    "the radio emission mainly originates at the forward shock as this collides with the dense csm associated with the er , thus creating a discontinuity in the magnetic field where particles are accelerated @xcite . the forward shock",
    "can be identified with the sharp outer edge of the snr shell , which propagates into the csm of spatially varying density .",
    "a similar scenario happens at the reverse shock , or inner edge of the snr envelope , which is normally dominated by the x - ray emission . between the reverse shock and",
    "the er , the reflected shocks lead to the higher temperatures of the shocked gas and a flatter density profile . up to day @xmath64000 , the x - ray emission has likely been generated by the interactions with the low - density hii region located on the inside of the er @xcite , whereas , in the last @xmath65000 days , it has primarily originated from the interaction with the dense inner ring @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig:44_x - ray_polar_pa ] , the 44 ghz image is compared to recent x - ray observations @xcite . as noted by @xcite ,",
    "the x - ray emission exhibits an east - west asymmetry less marked than what seen in the radio , while the north - south asymmetry is significant .",
    "in particular , the brightest x - ray site , which appears in the ne quadrant between pa 30@xmath20 and 60@xmath20 , overlaps with the brighter regions on the eastern lobe of the 44 ghz image , but peaks slightly northwards of the eastern radio peak . in the western lobe , the x - ray emission peaks at pa @xmath6270@xmath20 and between pa 300@xmath20 and 330@xmath20 .",
    "while the radio image is also reaching the western peak of brightness at pa @xmath6270@xmath20 , the region between pa 300@xmath20 and 330@xmath20 corresponds to one of the fainter sites ( see   [ morphology_44 ] ) .",
    "the offset between the x - ray and radio peaks is demonstrated in the polar projection of the two images shown in figure  [ fig:44_x - ray_polar_pa ] .",
    "the 44 ghz map and the _ hst _ image from recent observations are superimposed in figure  [ fig:44+hbl ] .",
    "it can be seen that the morphology of the radio emission matches the ring optical features .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : spectral_18 - 44_divide ] , on both the east and west sides of the optical ring , the easternmost and westernmost hot spots appear to overlap with the bright regions on the eastern and western lobes of the radio images .",
    "the fainter regions of the ring visible at 44 ghz , i.  e. located in the nw and sw quadrants , seem to coincide with sites where clusters of h@xmath5 hot spots appear somewhat disjointed .",
    "this is especially pronounced on the nw quadrant , between pa 300@xmath20 and 330@xmath20 , where the forward shock might have overtaken the er and reached less dense csm regions , while the inner surface of the ring is still hot enough to emit x - rays .",
    "as regards the remnant asymmetry , contrary to the radio images , the optical emission now appears markedly brighter on the western lobe .",
    "the difference in the asymmetry direction between the nonthermal radiation and the h@xmath5 emission is more clear in the rgb overlay shown in figure  [ fig : rgb:44+hbl+x - ray2 ] .",
    "it can be noted that the eastern lobe of the ring is dominated by the radio ( _ red _ ) and x - ray ( _ blue _ ) emissions , which turn into shades of violet in the overlay , especially in the ne quadrant where the radio and x - ray brighter sites overlap . on the western lobe , the fainter radio emission is now overshadowed by the h@xmath5 emission ( _ green _ ) .",
    "this appears to validate the hypothesis that the remnant asymmetry is likely due to an asymmetric explosion of the progenitor rather than to an asymmetric distribution of the csm .",
    "we may therefore expect the radio and x - ray emission to follow suit , with the east - west asymmetry gradually reversing .",
    "the possibility of an asymmetric initial explosion was suggested by @xcite to explain the asymmetric expansion of the remnant , whereas hydrodynamic calculations of the remnant evolution from the asymmetric explosion of a @xmath620 m@xmath177 merger of binary systems , have been proposed to explain the bsg progenitor and to link the bsg - rsg wind interaction to the triple - ring nebula structure ( @xcite ) .    in figure  [ fig:44+hbl ] , the radio emission from the inner region of the remnant as seen at 44 ghz",
    "can be compared to the optical emission from the ejecta .",
    "it is noted that the ejecta is blue and red - shifted along the line - of - sight @xcite and , like the emission from the er , the optical ejecta is characterised by an east - west asymmetric morphology , whose origin is yet unclear @xcite .",
    "the western side of the ejecta appears to overlap with the eastern part of the central feature visible at 44 ghz and , as mentioned in ",
    "[ spectral_interpretation ] , extends over a region of the snr that can be associated with flatter spectral indices .",
    "moreover , the ` hole ' in the ejecta , which is close to the sn location ( see figure  [ fig : spectral_18 - 44_divide ] ) and has become more pronounced in recent years @xcite , also overlaps with the central emission detected at 44 ghz .",
    "@xcite have estimated that the largest dust component , with mass @xmath178 , sits in the central region of the snr .",
    "however @xcite have concluded that , for observations up to 94 ghz , the dust does not contribute to the radio emission .",
    "the central feature detected at 44 ghz might therefore originate from a compact source or pwn located in the vicinity of the sn ejecta .",
    "to determine whether non - thermal radio emission from a pulsar or a pwn located in the inner regions of the snr would be detectable , we estimate the fraction of this emission that would be absorbed by the ionised gas likely located within the er . assuming the ionised mass in the ejecta , @xmath179 , to be distributed within a sphere of radius @xmath180 , the free - free optical depth , @xmath181 , is proportional to the path length through the free - free absorbing spherical region along the line - of - sight ( los ) . in convenient astronomical units ,",

    "as hii regions typically have electron temperatures of order 10@xmath191 k , indicated by @xmath192 , and , in the radio regime , @xmath193 @xcite , the free - free opacity becomes @xmath194 assuming @xmath195 , which is approximated by @xmath196 , and @xmath197 .",
    "+ figure  [ fig : ff_absorb ] shows the variation of @xmath181 as a function of the ionised mass for @xmath198 and volume size @xmath199 pc .",
    "the contour levels are plotted for @xmath200 . according to this simplified model , an ionised mass in excess of @xmath201 within a radius of 02 ( approximately corresponding to the size of the densest part of the ejecta visible with _ hst _ ) ,",
    "is required to produce a free - free optical depth of unity at 44 ghz .",
    "we note that the flux density from the emitting plasma , within a @xmath202 solid angle , given by @xmath203 , is negligible . in this scenario ,",
    "the radiation observed through the region of ionised plasma would be @xmath204 , where @xmath205 is the actual flux density at 44 ghz associated with the compact source in the background .",
    "therefore , since the flux density measured in the inner region of the 44 ghz image is @xmath206 mjy ( see   [ morphology_44 ] ) , the actual radio emission originating from a compact source inside the er could be as high as @xmath6 2.2 mjy .",
    "using the spectral index derived in figure  [ fig : spectral_index ] , this emission would lead to @xmath207 mjy at 94 ghz , which is consistent with the upper limit of 1 mjy set by @xcite at that frequency , for any discrete radio source in the central region of the remnant .    in the case of a more realistic , steeper density profile , such as",
    "that proposed by @xcite with @xmath208 , the emission from a pwn would be more heavily absorbed and could be detected only if there are holes in the ejecta . as it has been noted from _",
    "images in the r - band and b - band , the ejecta is likely to have holes @xcite ( see figures  [ fig:44+hbl ] and [ fig : rgb:44+hbl+x - ray2 ] ) , thus the radiation emitted by a pwn or compact source might escape the dense ionised material and become visible at lower frequencies . on the other hand , with a more compact density distribution , part of @xmath179 may have fallen back onto the neutron star that formed in the explosion , and , subsequently , the neutron star and any accreted ejecta might have already collapsed into a black hole .",

    "a summary of our findings is as follows :    * consistent with previous radio observations , the 44 ghz image shows a marked asymmetry in the emission distribution .",
    "more specifically , the east - west asymmetry ratio is @xmath209 from the ratio of the brightness peaks in the radial profiles at pa @xmath690@xmath20 , is @xmath35 from the integrated flux densities over the eastern and western halves of the image .",
    "these values are higher than the @xmath61.4 ratio derived for the new 18 ghz image and the ratio previously measured with images at lower frequencies . * the comparison between the new images at both 18 and 44 ghz with corresponding observations performed in earlier epochs , specifically the 2003 observations at 17 and 19 ghz and the 2008 observations at 36 ghz , highlights an asymmetric expansion of the remnant , with expansion velocities on the eastern lobe significantly higher than what measured on the western lobe . *",
    "the 1844 ghz spectral index distribution is measured at an angular resolution of @xmath59 .",
    "the spectral indices in snr 1987a primarily range between @xmath89 and @xmath210 , with a mean of @xmath86 .",
    "spectral indices associated with the brightest sites over the eastern lobe are steeper than the mean value .",
    "the steeper spectrum on the eastern lobe implies compression ratios slightly lower than on the western bright sites , and could be correlated with the higher expansion rate measured on the eastern side of the remnant .",
    "two regions of flatter spectral indices are identified , one approximately located in the centre of the snr and the other located further north .",
    "these two features lie at pa @xmath144 .",
    "* there is a strong correspondence between major features of the emission at 44 ghz , and the arrangement of the hot spots shown in the h@xmath5 emission .",
    "the direction of the east - west asymmetry of the x - ray and radio emission , is opposite to that of the h@xmath5 emission .",
    "this fact supports the hypothesis that the remnant asymmetric morphology might be due to an asymmetric explosion , rather than to an asymmetric distribution of the csm .",

    "the origin of this emission is unclear .",

    "<S> we present new imaging observations of the remnant of supernova ( sn ) 1987a at 44 ghz , performed in 2011 with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 resolution of the diffraction - limited image is the highest achieved to date in high - dynamic range . </S>",
    "<S> we also present a new atca image at 18 ghz derived from 2011 observations , which is super - resolved to @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the flux density is 40@xmath22 mjy at 44 ghz and 81@xmath26 mjy at 18 ghz . at both frequencies , </S>",
    "<S> the remnant exhibits a ring - like emission with two prominent lobes , and an east - west brightness asymmetry that peaks on the eastern lobe . </S>",
    "<S> a central feature of fainter emission appears at 44 ghz . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison with previous atca observations at 18 and 36 ghz highlights higher expansion velocities of the remnant eastern side . </S>",
    "<S> the 1844 ghz spectral index is @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral index map suggests slightly steeper values at the brightest sites on the eastern lobe , whereas flatter values are associated with the inner regions . </S>",
    "<S> the remnant morphology at 44 ghz generally matches the structure seen with contemporaneous x - ray and h@xmath5 observations . unlike the h@xmath5 emission , both the radio and x - ray emission peaks on the eastern lobe . </S>",
    "<S> the regions of flatter spectral index align and partially overlap with the optically - visible ejecta . </S>",
    "<S> simple free - free absorption models suggest that emission from a pulsar wind nebula or a compact source inside the remnant may now be detectable at high frequencies , or at low frequencies if there are holes in the ionised component of the ejecta . </S>"
