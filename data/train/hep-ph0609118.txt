    "at the time of this writing , the 2006 _ review of particle physics_@xcite has just landed on my desk .",
    "of this tome s 1232 pages , almost 10% list properties of baryon resonances . and",
    "yet , no consistent picture has yet been developed that predicts their rich spectroscopy with any degree of accuracy and consistency .",
    "quark models accommodate a number of observed multiplets but predict numerous others unsupported by experimental evidence , while treating resonances as meson - baryon bound states explains some of the resonant branching fractions but fails to reproduce the multiplet structure .",
    "both of these approaches derive from the underlying qcd theory only by employing heuristic arguments that are often obscure . and lattice gauge theory ,",
    "while not suffering this ambiguity , has far to develop before it will be able to take on such an intricate tangle of unstable states .",
    "since the beginning of 2002 , tom cohen and i have been developing a method@xcite that treats unstable baryon resonances consistently in the @xmath1 expansion of qcd as broad , unstable states [ masses lying @xmath2 above the ground - state baryons of mass @xmath3 , and widths of @xmath2 ] .",
    "the @xmath1 expansion is a well - defined field - theoretical limit of qcd - like theories ( specifically , qcd with @xmath0 rather than 3 colors ) and therefore escapes the criticisms of the previous paragraph . on the other hand , in its basic form",
    "the @xmath1 expansion tells only how to count powers of @xmath1 and does not by itself provide a means of computing dynamical quantities .",
    "even so , it provides an organizing principle of remarkable power,@xcite especially for baryons .",
    "this formalism has been outlined in a number of earlier conference proceedings,@xcite the first of which was the preceding installment of this caqcd series.@xcite since space here is limited , i provide only a sketchy description of the origin of the method in sec .",
    "[ old ] and refer the interested reader to the prior write - ups for more detail , and in sec .",
    "[ new ] summarize findings since the last caqcd conference.@xcite",
    "chiral soliton models , particularly the skyrme model , achieved a degree of fashionability in the early to mid-1980 s , owing to a series of papers@xcite discussing their topological character and connection to large @xmath0 .",
    "prominent in this era were a number of works noting the model independence of a number of their predictions , particularly linear relations between meson - baryon scattering amplitudes ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath5).@xcite as gradually became clear , these results are consequences of an underlying symmetry imposed by the soliton s hedgehog configuration , which is characterized by the quantum number @xmath6 , where @xmath7 ; the scattering amplitudes , labeled by good @xmath8 and @xmath9 quantum numbers , are then obtained by forming linear combinations of the @xmath6-labeled amplitudes in an exercise of `` clebschology . ''",
    "subsequently it was recognized that the underlying @xmath6 conservation can be expressed , via crossing from the @xmath10 channel to the @xmath11 channel , in terms of the rule @xmath12.@xcite nevertheless , the connection of these results to large @xmath0 depended upon identifying the hedgehog configuration and its excitations with this limit ; it is certainly a reasonable approach , because the ground - state baryons are built from the hedgehog , which exhibits the maximal symmetry between @xmath8 and @xmath9 characterizing the ground - state baryons . nevertheless , to see true compatibility with large @xmath0",
    "one needs a formalism that studies real meson - baryon scattering in the large @xmath0 limit ; this is provided by the consistency condition approach developed in the early 1990s.@xcite one offshoot of this program@xcite showed the @xmath13 rule to be an immediate consequence , and moreover that amplitudes with @xmath14 are suppressed by at least @xmath15 .",
    "the pieces were then in place to show that 1 ) the old linear amplitude relations based on @xmath6 are true large @xmath0 results,@xcite 2 ) the relations apply also to the baryon resonances embedded in these amplitudes,@xcite and 3 ) @xmath16 corrections can be incorporated@xcite by including suppressed amplitudes with @xmath17 .",
    "moreover , while the ground - state band of baryons , @xmath18 , in the naive quark and chiral soliton pictures for large @xmath0 is the same , the irreducible excited baryon multiplets of the quark picture turn out to be reducible collections of multiplets labeled by @xmath6 ( `` compatibility'').@xcite the underlying @xmath6 conservation leads to a predictive pattern@xcite of allowed and forbidden decays [ explaining , _",
    "e.g. _ , the dominance of the @xmath19 decay of @xmath20 , since the @xmath21 pole in the @xmath22 negative - parity channel couples only to @xmath19 ] , tells what types of resonant multiplets are allowed,@xcite and respects the broadness of resonances and configuration mixing between resonances of the same quantum numbers.@xcite",
    "[ [ pion - photoproduction . ] ] pion photoproduction .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the same approach that applies to meson - baryon scattering may be employed as well for other cases of physical interest . as long as the quantum numbers and @xmath1 suppressions of the fields coupling to the baryon are known ,",
    "the same methods apply . here",
    "one has in mind such processes as photoproduction,@xcite electroproduction , or real or virtual compton scattering .",
    "photons , for example , carry both isovector and isoscalar quantum numbers , the former dominating@xcite in baryon couplings by a factor of @xmath0 .",
    "amplitudes that include the leading [ relative @xmath2 ] and first subleading [ @xmath24 isovector and the leading [ @xmath24 isoscalar amplitudes then produces linear relations among multipole amplitudes with relative @xmath25 corrections.@xcite while the relations obtained this way that reflect the dominance of isovector over isoscalar amplitudes agree quite impressively with data ( _ i.e. _ , the amplitudes have the same shape as functions of photon energy ) , a number of other relations , particularly for magnetic multipoles , superficially appear to fare badly .",
    "however , in those cases the threshold behaviors still agree quite well , followed by seemingly divergent behavior in the respective resonant regions .",
    "these discrepancies appear to be due to the slightly different placement [ at @xmath26 of resonances that are degenerate in the large @xmath0 limit but with different @xmath27 values .",
    "when a comparison of the amplitude relations is performed by taking _ on - resonance _",
    "couplings@xcite , the linear relations good to @xmath25 do indeed produce agreement to within about 1 part in 9.@xcite    [ [ three - flavors . ] ] three flavors .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the work summarized in the previous section all referred to systems either containing only @xmath28 and @xmath29 quarks , or those in which any heavier quarks are inert spectators . in nature",
    ", however , there appears to be some evidence that not only the baryon ground - state band but resonances as well exhibit a degree of su(3 ) flavor symmetry .",
    "the first task in such analysis in the @xmath1 expansion is to have the group theory under control , which requires tables of su(3 ) clebsch - gordan coefficients ( cgc ) as functions of @xmath0 ; the standard ladder operator methods may be employed to derive them.@xcite since baryons at large @xmath0 have the quantum numbers of @xmath0 quarks , their su(3 ) representations are much larger than for @xmath30 ; for example , the analogue to the 3-color , 3-flavor octet is called `` * 8 * '' : @xmath31 $ ] , which has @xmath32 states .",
    "one finds that the linear amplitude relations connecting resonances of different @xmath8 and @xmath9 for two flavors contain su(3 ) cgc in the 3-flavor case , and therefore link together members of distinct su(3 ) multiplets with various @xmath9 values.@xcite such a phenomenon is known from chiral soliton models , and occurs for the same reason : the group theory is inherited from large @xmath0 ! once a single resonance is found and its quantum numbers are measured , large @xmath0 tells what other states of different @xmath9 , @xmath8 , and strangeness should be degenerate to @xmath33 [ not counting the additive @xmath34150  mev contribution for each @xmath10-quark ] in both mass and width .",
    "this is a very useful diagnostic when one has a candidate exotic baryon , such as was the @xmath35.@xcite    but it is also useful in identifying su(3 ) partners of nonexotic resonances .",
    "for example , the @xmath20 should have strange partners@xcite that are also @xmath36-philic ; and in fact , there exists the @xmath37 state @xmath38 that lies only 5  mev above the @xmath39 threshold ( the phase space for @xmath40 is 6 times larger ) , and yet its branching ratio to this channel is 1025% .",
    "other convincing examples@xcite following the large @xmath0 reasoning populate the sector of @xmath41 and @xmath42 resonances , but in many cases the uncertainty on branching ratios , or even the existence of the resonances themselves , is questionable .",
    "for example , large @xmath0 makes definite statements about the spectroscopy and decays of @xmath43 and @xmath44 resonances as well , but too little is known about them experimentally to make definitive comparisons .",
    "as noted in the previous section , the familiar quark model multiplets at large @xmath0 such as the su(6)@xmath45o(3 ) ( `` * 70*'',@xmath46 ) actually form collections of distinct irreducible multiplets in large @xmath0 . in the case",
    "just mentioned , one finds 5 such multiplets , labeled by @xmath47 , whose masses can differ at @xmath2 . those with @xmath48",
    "define the multiplets with nonstrange members ( _ e.g. _ , `` * 8 * '' , `` * 10 * '' ) , while those with @xmath49 define multiplets whose states of maximal hypercharge have a strange quark ( _ e.g. _ , `` * 1 * '' ) .",
    "an unexpected result arises in the su(3 ) group theory , in the form a a theorem restricting which meson - baryon states have leading - order [ @xmath2 , by unitarity ] cgc.@xcite one can prove that su(3 ) cgc for _",
    "meson _ @xmath51 _ baryon_@xmath52 can be @xmath2 only if @xmath53 , which is to say that the meson must have a hypercharge equal to the difference of the tops of the two baryon representations . in particular , the dominant two - body decay mode of a @xmath41 resonance in an `` * 8 * '' is predicted to be @xmath54 , while one in a `` * 1 * '' prefers @xmath55 .",
    "evidence for this remarkable result appears in , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath56 @xmath57 , where the coupling constant to @xmath55 , once the threshold @xmath58 factor is taken into account , is 45 [ = @xmath3 ] times larger than that for @xmath40 .",
    "indeed , the su(3 ) content of @xmath56 is traditionally assigned to be dominantly singlet .",
    "the su(3 ) theorem is also the key ingredient in the proof that the @xmath13 rule holds for three - flavor as well as two - flavor processes , and moreover that processes with strangeness exchange are suppressed ( the @xmath60 rule).@xcite this result predicts , for example , that the process @xmath61 is suppressed in cross section by @xmath1 compared to @xmath62 .    [ [ decoupling - spurious - states . ] ] decoupling spurious states .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    since , as noted , large @xmath0 baryons inhabit much larger su(3 ) representations and also allow much higher spins than for @xmath63 , most of these states must be @xmath64 artifacts and need to be decoupled from the theory as spurious if they appear in amplitudes for physical @xmath30 processes .",
    "the effects of such states must disappear smoothly and exactly at the value of @xmath0 where they become spurious.@xcite it would be extremely coincidental for such decoupling to occur through cancellation among dynamical quantities , which depend sensitively upon nonperturbative effects , not least of which are the precise values of quark masses .",
    "we therefore argue@xcite that the only sources of true decoupling are group - theoretical in nature , either because the states of interest have isospin or strangeness values too high to reach in conventional @xmath30 meson - baryon scattering , or lie in states in su(3 ) multiplets that decouple when @xmath30 .",
    "such decoupling appears through factors of @xmath65 , a very special type of @xmath1 correction .",
    "for example , for @xmath64 the `` * 1 * '' contains states with @xmath43 quantum numbers , and the su(3 ) coupling for @xmath66 to this state indeed contains a factor of @xmath67 .",
    "[ [ interplay - of - chiral - and - large - n_c - limits . ] ] interplay of chiral and large @xmath0 limits .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    since meson - baryon scattering at threshold has also been studied in the context of another well - known expansion of strong interaction physics , the chiral expansion , it is natural to ask how the chiral and large @xmath0 limits cooperate and compete.@xcite the large @xmath0 counting constraints for scattering amplitudes formally hold at all energies , while the chiral results become increasingly better the closer one approaches threshold . among these results",
    "are the famed weinberg - tomozawa relation ( between @xmath68 @xmath69 scattering lengths ) .",
    "other well - known results relevant to the chiral @xmath70 in meson - baryon scattering are the adler - weisberger ( aw ) and goldberger - oehme - miyazawa ( gmo ) cross section sum rules .    from the point of view of the @xmath1 expansion ,",
    "scattering lengths are simply the derivatives of scattering amplitudes at zero meson energy .",
    "one finds that the combination corresponding to the wt and other chiral - limit relations are @xmath2 but very well satisfied experimentally ( as expected for threshold results ) , while most combinations that are @xmath71 are not as well satisfied , but still have magnitudes consistent with the naive counting [ that is , a dimensionless @xmath71 combination is not larger than , say , 2/3 ] .",
    "the aw and gmo sum rules are not chiral limit results ( they sum over all allowed energies ) , but nevertheless refer to chiral @xmath70 s . in these cases",
    "one encounters the effect of the noncommutativity of the two limits : in particular , both fail if the large @xmath0 limit is taken prior to the chiral limit , a consequence of the fact that the @xmath72-@xmath73 mass difference is @xmath71 and therefore falls below @xmath74 for sufficiently large @xmath0 . in that case",
    "the @xmath72 becomes stable and must be treated on the same footing as the @xmath73 .",
    "the @xmath1 expansion provides a formalism in which to analyze meson - baryon scattering processes , including their rich spectrum of embedded resonances .",
    "the resonances appear in multiplets that bear a similarity to , but are more fundamental than , the old su(6)@xmath45o(3 ) quark model multiplets .",
    "these multiplets have distinct dominant decay channels , it e.g. , by preferring @xmath55 over @xmath75 or @xmath40 .",
    "they are constrained by preferring @xmath12 , @xmath60 processes .",
    "the problem of removing spurious ( @xmath64 ) states from the theory has been solved , and the nature of the interplay between the chiral and large @xmath0 limits in meson - baryon scattering has been explored .    a number of interesting formal and phenomenological issues remain to be resolved .",
    "for example , all results presented here hold for single - meson scattering ; of course , constraints also occur for scattering with , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath76 final states , but these are as yet unexplored . moreover , the three - flavor scattering results presented thus far only scratch the surface of the detailed phenomenological analysis that is now possible .",
    "a reliable means now exists to shed light on one of the darker corners of particle physics .",
