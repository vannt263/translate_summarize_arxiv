    "* system - bath model . *",
    "we consider a qubit system interacting with a bosonic bath , described by a full hamiltonian : @xmath2where @xmath3 is the free hamiltonian of the qubit ( assuming @xmath4 ) , with @xmath5 being the pauli operator of the qubit and @xmath6 standing for the transition frequency between the two levels of the qubit ; @xmath7 is the free hamitonian of the bosonic bath with @xmath8 and @xmath9 being the bosonic creation and annihilation operators of the @xmath10th mode of frequency @xmath11 ; and @xmath12is the interaction hamiltonian between the qubit and the bath with @xmath13 being the coupling strength between the qubit and the @xmath10th mode of the bath",
    ". one essential aspect of our study is that the interaction hamiltonian @xmath14 is in a non - rwa form . because of the difficulty in studying this kind of non - rwa interaction , previous studies have used a rwa treatment for simplicity by assuming the interaction hamiltonian as @xmath15where the effect of the counter - rotating terms were omitted .",
    "recently , it was found that the counter - rotating terms are necessary in order to accurately describe the spin - boson interaction  @xcite and using the conventional rwa approach may lead to faulty results@xcite .",
    "assume that the whole system is initially in the state @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the initial state of the qubit and chosen as a maximally mixed state @xmath18 .",
    "the bath is considered to be initially in a vacuum state @xmath19vac@xmath20 with @xmath21vac@xmath22 .",
    "the system - bath coupling spectrum is assumed as a lorentz - type @xmath23where @xmath24 is the broadening width of the bosonic mode of frequency @xmath25 , which is connected to the bath correlation time @xmath26 .",
    "the relaxation time scale @xmath27 , on which the state of the system changes , is related to @xmath28 by @xmath29 the @xmath28 partly reflects the system - bath coupling strength , because one will obtain the effective coupling strength as @xmath30 after integrating the spectrum @xmath31 over the entire region of @xmath25 .",
    "the evolution under the total hamiltonian  ( [ eq : ham ] ) can be translated into the language of quantum channel .",
    "thus the evolution map of the basis vectors can be described as @xmath32where @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) represents the ground ( excited ) state of the qubit while the vector @xmath21even@xmath35 ( @xmath21odd@xmath35 ) describes the evolved vector of the bath , which is actually a superposition of all the number states ( e.g. , @xmath36 ) with an even ( odd ) excitation number ( i.e. , @xmath37 is even or odd ) .",
    "note that the subscript @xmath38(@xmath39 ) of @xmath21even@xmath35 ( @xmath21odd@xmath35 ) corresponds to the initial vector @xmath40vac@xmath41 .",
    "the vectors satisfy the orthogonality @xmath42even@xmath21odd@xmath43 ( including @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) .",
    "they also satisfy the normalizing condition @xmath42even@xmath21even@xmath46 and @xmath42odd@xmath21odd@xmath46 .",
    "the overlap @xmath42even@xmath21even@xmath47 or @xmath42odd@xmath21odd@xmath47 ( @xmath45 ) outputs a complex number .",
    "the probabilities  @xmath48 and @xmath49 are time - dependent , with @xmath50 $ ]  and  @xmath51 $ ] .",

    "@xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) stands for the matrix elements of the qubit s initial state , while @xmath58 @xmath59even@xmath21even@xmath60 and @xmath61 @xmath62odd@xmath21odd@xmath63 are the time - dependent complex numbers .    *",
    "experimental setup and implementation of the non - rwa channel .",
    "* our experimental setup is sketched in fig.1 . in fig.1(a ) , pairs of photons with a 810 nm wavelength are produced by pumping a type - i beta - barium - borate ( bbo ) crystal with ultraviolet pulses at @xmath64  nm centered wavelength .",
    "then one photon is led into a state - preparation process .",
    "that is , the first polarized beam splitter ( pbs@xmath65 ) selects the horizontally - polarized state @xmath66 of the photon , and then a half wave plate ( hwp ) and a quarter - wave plate ( qwp ) can rotate @xmath66 into one of the six eigenstates of the pauli operators .",
    "fig.1(b ) accomplishes the task of the non - rwa quantum channel .",
    "we use the horizontal and vertical polarization modes @xmath66 and @xmath67 to encode the qubit s basis states .",
    "the bath acts by a collective performance of four path modes @xmath68 with @xmath69 . in order to briefly introduce the implementation of the channel , let us start from the output of pbs@xmath70 , where the @xmath71 and @xmath72 components are spatially separated so that each one can be rotated with the wave plate hwp@xmath65 by angle @xmath73 $ ] and the wave plate hwp@xmath70 by angle @xmath74 @xmath75 $ ] .",
    "after rotating by the wave plate hwp@xmath65 , the @xmath66 mode becomes a superposition as @xmath76 . by transmitting it along a loop",
    ", the superposition state undergoes pbs@xmath70 again  and couples with the spatial modes @xmath77 and",
    "@xmath78 encoded as the path numbers in fig .",
    "1(b ) , resulting in the state latexmath:[$\\cos 2\\theta _ { 1}|h\\rangle     it is worth noting that we make use of two soleil - babinet compensators ( sbc@xmath65 and sbc@xmath70 ) in order to append a phase @xmath80 to the passing components @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) . here",
    ", @xmath81 is  the photon frequency and @xmath82 is the traveling  time of the photon across the sbc , where @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) denotes the thickness of sbc@xmath85 , @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) indicates the indices of refraction ( corresponding to the @xmath71 and @xmath72 polarizations ) , and @xmath88 is the vacuum speed of light .",
    "hence there are four phases @xmath89 $ ] appended to the polarization states of photons passing sbc@xmath65 and sbc@xmath70 .",
    "this innovative design enables us to realistically describe the varying phase of the off - diagonal elements of the system s density matrix .    in fig.1(b ) , there are several birefringent calcite beam displacers ( bd@xmath90 ) which deviate the @xmath71 component and transmit the @xmath72 one . among them , we insert some wave plates to implement operations on the polarization states .",
    "the angles of hwp@xmath91 are adjusted as @xmath92 $ ] and @xmath93 $ ] to transform a single component ( @xmath71 or @xmath72 ) into a superposition form , while the angles of hwp@xmath94 are fixed at @xmath95 to convert @xmath71 into @xmath72 or vice versa .",
    "the input - output states of fig.1(b ) are mapped as follows(see details in the method section ) :    @xmath96    where @xmath97 and @xmath98 . by comparing eq.([hv_map ] ) with eq.([nonrwa_map",
    "] ) , it can be seen that the reduced density operator of the system in eq.([rho_nonrwa ] ) is successfully reproduced , by setting the parameters @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 .",
    "it is noted that according to the hierarchy equation method@xcite , the qubit state at an arbitrary time @xmath103 can be simulated by adjusting the parameters @xmath104 and @xmath105 according to the theoretical results obtained by the hierarchy equation method .    in fig.1(c ) , the density matrix of the output state is reconstructed by quantum tomography process where ten different coincidence measurement bases are set by qwps , hwps and pbss .",
    "eight of the bases are set along paths 0 and 3 , while the rest are set along the paths 1 and 2 .",
    "finally , the photons are detected by single - photon detectors equipped with 10 nm interference filters .    as an application , our proposed experimental setup ( fig .",
    "1 ) can be used to implement the channel governed by the rwa treatment of the interaction hamiltonian in eq.([rwa - hint ] ) . based on the evolution map in eq.([hv_map ] ) , one can set the hwp angles @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and adjust @xmath108 $ ] according to the theoretical results with rwa . furthermore , the phases @xmath109 is adjusted in @xmath110 $ ] according to the theoretical results , and @xmath111 is set randomly",
    ". then the evolution map in the schrdinger picture reads : @xmath112where @xmath113 , and the spacial modes @xmath77 and @xmath114 correspond to the paths @xmath115 and @xmath116 in fig .",
    "1(b ) , respectively .",
    "if we further set the phases @xmath117 according to the interaction picture , eq.(rwa_channel ) describes the so - called amplitude decay channel which is just the channel implemented in ref .",
    "the authors in  @xcite tested strong coupling cases in order to explore abundant non - markovianity .",
    "however , it was theoretically predicated that the channels with or without rwa can cause quite different non - markovian behavior especially in strong - coupling cases  @xcite . from this point of view , considering the quantum channels without rwa is of importance and an interesting question .",
    "another well - known channel , the so - called phase damping channel considered in@xcite , is also easy to implement in our scheme . based on eq .",
    "( [ hv_map ] ) , by setting @xmath118 , @xmath119 and adjusting @xmath93 $ ] , one can have the following evolution map : @xmath120 , and the spacial modes @xmath77 and @xmath121 correspond to the paths @xmath115 and @xmath122 in fig .",

    "*  ts parameter .",
    "* in the ts problem , * *  * * a system is sent to a distant receiver ( say bob ) through a quantum channel .",
    "before bob receives the system , a detector or manipulator ( say alice ) performs some measurements on the system",
    ". then the ts problem refers to the characterization of the influence of alice s measurement at an initial time @xmath123 ( let @xmath124 in this paper ) on the final state captured by bob at a later time @xmath125 .",
    "the ts in the qubit systems can be detected by * *  * * a concept named as ts parameter @xmath126  which is defined in terms of a temporal analogue of the steering inequality@xcite , @xmath127where @xmath128 ( @xmath129 ) stands for the @xmath130th observable measured by alice ( bob ) at @xmath123 ( @xmath125 ) and the number of observable is @xmath131 or @xmath116 . @xmath132with @xmath133 being the probability of alice s measurement outcome @xmath134 or @xmath135 .",
    "the bob s expectation value , conditioned on alice s measurement outcome , is defined as@xmath136where @xmath137 denotes the condition probability of bob s measurement outcome @xmath138 ( at @xmath125 ) on the evolved state starting from the collapsed version after alice s measurement with the outcome @xmath139 ( at @xmath123 ) . in this paper",
    ", we take the case of @xmath131 into account .",
    "the violation of the inequality in eq.([s_inequality ] ) , i.e. @xmath140 , is a  sufficient condition for the steerability .",
    "therefore , during an evolution , one can define the steerable durations conditioned by @xmath140 .    *",
    "experimental and numerical results of ts parameter . *",
    "we consider that alice chooses a pair of the pauli operators @xmath141 @xmath142 as the observables ( @xmath143 ) measuredon the initial state @xmath144 of the qubit .",
    "after the measurement , the qubit state collapses to one of the six eigenstates of the pauli operators with a probability @xmath145 .",
    "this process is usually difficult to implement in experiments , since it requires a set of nondestructive measurements .",
    "an equivalent way , adopted in this experiment , is to assume that alice prepares qubit states by rotating the polarization mode @xmath146 into one of the six eigenstates of the pauli operators , and correspondingly multiplies a probability of @xmath133 .",
    "this preparation is completed by sequentially using the pbs@xmath65 , a hwp , and a qwp [ see fig.1(a ) ] .",
    "then the qubit in the prepared state is sent through the quantum channel [ simulated in fig.1(b ) ] to bob , who performs tomography measurements [ fig.1(c ) ] .",
    "therefore , bob obtains the condition probabilities @xmath137 and calculates @xmath147 .  theoretically speaking , @xmath147 is a function of the time @xmath103 , the channel parameter @xmath28 , and the parameter @xmath24 .",
    "actually , in our experiment , the dynamics of @xmath147  is simulated by adjusting the angles of hwps and the thicknesses of sbcs .",
    "the experimental errors are estimated from the statistical variation of photon counts , which satisfy the poisson distribution .",
    "figure2 shows @xmath147 vs evolution time scaled by @xmath6 . in fig.2(a ) and fig.2(b ) , the measurement bases are @xmath148 ( @xmath149 ) and @xmath150 ( @xmath151 ) , which correspond to the eigenstates of @xmath152and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "our experimental and theoretical results are in good agreement and show the oscillation of ts parameter @xmath147 with time .",
    "more important is the steering limit , i.e. , @xmath153 , which is marked by a red - dashed horizontal line in fig .  2 .",
    "above this limit , steerability is valid .",
    "the vertical dashed lines highlight the steerable durations corresponding to @xmath140 . for the sake of comparison , we study two kinds of channels , i.e. , the non - rwa channel and the rwa channel .",
    "the former is modeled by the hamiltonian([non - rwa - hint ] ) and experimentally simulated according to the evolution map in eq.([hv_map ] ) , while the latter is modeled by the hamiltonian([rwa - hint ] ) and experimentally simulated based on the evolution map in eq.(rwa_channel ) . in both of the cases of rwa and non - rwa channels , @xmath147 is suppresed below the steering limit in most of the evolution periods due to the quantum decoherence effects . however , the difference between the two cases is  obvious .",
    "there are more peaks of @xmath147 over the steering limit in the rwa case [ fig.2(b ) ] than the non - rwa case [ fig.2(a ) ] , which implies that the rwa channel appears to provide longer steerable durations .",
    "similar conclusions can be made by comparing the results in fig .",
    "2(c ) and fig .",
    "2(d ) , where another set of measurement bases are chosen , i.e. , @xmath148 ( @xmath149 ) and @xmath154 ( @xmath155 ) ( eigenstates of @xmath156 and @xmath157 , respectively ) .",
    "however we should point out that the extra steerable durations in rwa cases are inauthentic , due to the essential defects in characterizing the system - bath interaction by using rwa .    * experimental and numerical results of ts weight .",
    "* we also experimentally test the steerable weight of ts , i.e. , @xmath158 ( see the definition in the method section ) , as illustrated in fig.3 .",
    "the experimental implementations in the input - state preparation ( at alice s side ) and the tomography measurement on the output states ( at bob s side ) are the same as those in fig.2 .",
    "the non - rwa case [ fig.3(a ) ] and rwa case [ fig.3(b ) ] are investigated .",
    "the parameters @xmath28 and @xmath24 are chosen as same as those in fig.2 .",
    "consequently , we compare the results shown in figs.3(a ) and ( b ) with those in figs.2(c ) and ( d ) . since @xmath158 is defined according to the sufficient and necessary condition of the exsitence of ts , the data of @xmath158 precisely tells us when the ts exists and disappears , especially for the durations below the ts limit @xmath153 [ fig.2(c ) and ( d ) ] , where the criterion @xmath147 is disabled to detect ts .    by comparison of fig.3(a ) with fig.3(b ) , more interesting phenomena are found , i.e. , there are obvious sudden death  and revival  of ts in the non - rwa channel , whereas they never appear in the rwa channel where ts tends to zero asymptotically .",
    "we shall emphasize that the quantum correlation like ts inevitably undergoes a sudden change to zero rather than a gradual decrease , especially when the characterization of the system - bath interaction becomes close to the actual situation .",
    "this also reminds us of the previous famous report on the sudden death of entanglement@xcite .",
    "with the proposed setup , we have experimentally implemented a non - rwa quantum channel and simulated the dynamics of a qubit system interacting with a bosonic bath , without applying born , markov and rotating - wave approximations .",
    "this kind of quantum channel provides a more realistic description of the environmental impact and allows a variety of investigation on coherence dynamics in open systems .",
    "based on this channel , we have studied the important ts problem experimentally , which is attracting much attention recently . by means of the ts inequality , the experimental data agree well with the theoretical results , showing that quantum decoherence can significantly shorten the steerable durations .",
    "furthermore , our investigation shows that although the rwa channel seems to provide longer steerable durations than the non - rwa case , the results without  rwa are closer to realistic situations and thus more reliable .    by investigating the ts weight , we observed some new interesting phenomena in the non - rwa channel , i.e. , the sudden death  and revival  of the ts , which however do not appear in the rwa channel .",
    "the rwa channel presents a false superiority compared with the non - rwa case .",
    "characterizing the quantum channel as precisely as possible is necessary and important in the study of quantum steering dynamics .",
    "our studies show that an often - used approximation method such as the rwa leads to a deviation from the facts .",
    "it remains an open question to test other quantum correlation dynamics in the non - rwa quantum channel . on the other hand ,",
    "since quantum steering inequalities are closely linked with the security of the quantum cryptographic protocols , our findings are expected to have valuable applications in secure quantum communications .",

    "the task of bob is to check whether the states he receives can be written in a hidden - state form , i.e.@xmath172 in eq.([tsw_2 ] ) , where @xmath24 ( @xmath173 ) indicates a classical random variable .",
    "@xmath174 indicates a set of positive semidefinite matrices held by bob , and @xmath175 is the deterministic single - party conditional probability according to alice s measurement outcome @xcite .",
    "nonzero @xmath158 implies that bob can not classically fabricate alice s measurement results , and thus the quantum temporal correlation ( i.e. , the ts ) exists between alice and bob .",

    "<S> characterizing the dynamics of open systems usually starts with a perturbative theory and involves various approximations , such as the born , markov and rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the approximation approaches could introduce more or less incompleteness in describing the bath behaviors . here , we consider a quantum channel , which is modeled by a qubit ( a two - level system ) interacting with a bosonic bath . </S>",
    "<S> unlike the traditional works , we experimentally simulate the system - bath interaction without applying the born , markov , and rotating - wave approximations . </S>",
    "<S> to our knowledge , this is the first experimental simulation of the quantum channels without any approximations mentioned above , by using linear optical devices . </S>",
    "<S> the results are quite useful and interesting , which not only reveal the effect of the counter - rotating terms but also present a more accurate picture of the quantum channel dynamics . besides , we experimentally investigate the dynamics of the quantum temporal steering ( ts ) , i.e. , a temporal analogue of einstein - podolsky - rosen steering . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental and theoretical results are in good agreement and show that the counter - rotating terms significantly influence the ts dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> there are obviously different dynamics of ts in non - rwa and rwa channels . </S>",
    "<S> however , we emphasize that the results without rwa are closer to realistic situations and thus more reliable . </S>",
    "<S> due to the close relationship between ts and the security of the quantum cryptographic protocols , our findings are expected to have useful applications in secure quantum communications and future interesting ts studies .    </S>",

    "<S> epr steering problems refer to the quantum nonlocal correlations , which allow one of the subsystems to remotely prepare or steer the other one via local measurements . </S>",
    "<S> epr steering is ususlly treated as an intermediate scenario lying in between the entanglement and the bell nonlocality . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , some entangled states can not be employed to achieve steering tasks , and some steerable states do not violate bell - like inequalities  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , quantum steering problems have attracted considerable interest@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> apart from the fundamental interests of steering in quantum mechanics  1,2,3,4,5,5 - 1,6,7,8,8 - 1,9,10 , there are lots of application motivations for epr steering which is thought to be the driving power of quantum secure communication and teleportation@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , steering allows quantum key distribution ( qkd ) if one party trusts his own devices but not those of the other party@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an outstanding advantage is that this steering - dominated scenario is easier to implement , when compared with the completely - device - independent protocols@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> several inequalities in terms of sufficient conditions of steerability were employed to detect steerable states@xcite , and such inequalities have been tested by several experiments  @xcite . beyond inequalities , </S>",
    "<S> a number of possible measures were developed to quantify the quantum steerability @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> very recently , skrzypczyk etal . proposed a powerful measure named the steerable weight  16,17 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , steerability was found to be equivalent to joint measurability  @xcite . a close relationship between steerability and quantum - subchannel discrimination </S>",
    "<S> was discovered in  @xcite .    among the steering studies , </S>",
    "<S> a novel and important direction is to consider quantum steering in time , i.e. , the so - called temporal steering ( ts )  21 . </S>",
    "<S> different from discussing the spatially - separated systems , ts problems focus on a single system at different times . in this frame </S>",
    "<S> , a system is sent to a distant receiver ( say bob ) through a quantum channel , then a detector or manipulator ( say alice ) performs some operations ( including measurements on the system ) before bob receives the system and performs his measurement . </S>",
    "<S> the nonzero ts accounts for how strongly alice s choice of measurements at an initial time can influence the final state captured by bob . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , ts also reveals a unique link between a quantum system s past and future features . </S>",
    "<S> no third party can steer as strongly as bob or gather full information about the final state . </S>",
    "<S> based on this quantum origin , the ts inequality@xcite becomes a very useful tool in verifying the suitability of a quantum channel for a certain qkd process . </S>",
    "<S> compared with the spatial steering inequalities , ts inequality presents a superior applicability . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the entanglement based scenarios are no longer necessary , and one can directly carry out the famous bb84 protocol and other related protocols@xcite .    in order to quantify ts , a concept of _ temporal steerable weight _ was introduced in the literature@xcite , where the authors found that ts characterized by the weight can be used to define a sufficient and practical measure of strong non - markovianity . </S>",
    "<S> this implies the evident dependence of ts dynamics on the properties of quantum channels . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it was found that ts is intrinsically associated with realism and joint measurability  @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate the influence of a quantum channel on the ts behavior . </S>",
    "<S> this is a particular ts problem rather than epr steering , because the formation of the quantum correlation between the system s initial and final state lies on the quantum channel . </S>",
    "<S> for example , during a unitary evolution , alice is able to perfectly steer the final state received by bob . </S>",
    "<S> a nontrivial case of ts refers to a non - unitary dynamics when alice s influence is erased partially or completely . </S>",
    "<S> because ts is sensitive to the characteristics of the channel , a natural question arises : what kind of channel should we take into account ?    usually , the description of the dynamics of open systems starts with a perturbative theory and involves various approximations , such as the born , markov and rotating - wave approximation  ( rwa ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is widely believed that the approximation approaches introduce more or less the incompleteness of the description of the bath . </S>",
    "<S> an efficient numerical method that avoids using the above approximations was developed by tanimura et  al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , who established a set of hierarchical equations that includes all orders of system - bath interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the hierarchy equation method has been successfully employed to describe the quantum dynamics of various physical and chemical systems  @xcite as well as some quantum devices@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the aims of this paper are as follows . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , we propose a linear - optical setup to experimentally simulate a quantum channel modeled by a quantum two - level system ( i.e. , qubit ) interacting with a bosonic bath , without applying born , markov and rotating - wave approximations . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental parameters accounting for the dynamics of the qubit are set by means of the hierarchy equation method . to the best of our knowledge , </S>",
    "<S> this is the first experimental simulation of this kind of quantum channel in a linear optical setup . </S>",
    "<S> our experimental simulation offers a fruitful testbed for the studies of open quantum systems . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , we experimentally investigate the ts problems in this channel . </S>",
    "<S> our study indeed provides a more realistic representation of the environment influence than the usual quantum channels such as the amplitude damping channel , where the environment was only treated simply . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we found that there is a lack of experimental study of ts problems up to now . </S>",
    "<S> some existing study  @xcite was only based on a phenomenologically - designed channel and thus it is impossible to highlight the important role of the system - bath interaction . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the channel under our study , governed by a system - bath hamiltonian without rwa , allows us not only to reflect the special roles of the counter - rotating terms , but also to consider the system - bath couplings in arbitrarily strong regimes . </S>"
