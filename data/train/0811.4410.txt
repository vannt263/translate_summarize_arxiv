    "many studies on fine particulate flows have based particle s description on an equation - referred to as maxey - riley - gatignol - which is an exact derivation of the forces on a particle in a nonuniform unsteady flow in the limit of vanishing reynolds numbers @xmath8 and @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the slip particle velocity respect to the fluid and @xmath11 the typical shear - scale in the flow ( @xcite ) . in the net hydrodynamical force acting on a particle given by this equation one recognizes several contributions : the steady stokes drag , the fluid acceleration force ( sum of the pressure gradient and the dissipative forces on the fluid ) , the added mass , the buoyancy , the history basset - boussinesq force , and faxn corrections .",
    "when the control parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 become finite , the non - linearity of the flow dynamics in the vicinity of the particle must be taken into account ( see the review by @xcite ) .",
    "an expression for the added mass term which is correct at any @xmath14 value has been derived by @xcite .",
    "but much more complicated is the situation for the other forces involved .",
    "the drag term becomes @xmath12 dependent and empirical expressions based on numerical computations have been proposed ( see @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , a lift force appears at finite values of @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "this force is notably hard to model because of the non - linear combination of shear and vorticity , and approximate expressions based on saffman ( small @xmath14 ) and lighthill - auton ( large @xmath14 ) mechanisms are often used in studies ( see e.g. discussion on lift on bubbles by @xcite ) .",
    "theoretical and numerical studies of fine disperse multi - phase flows , which aim at describing the behavior of a large number of particles , have adopted simplified models where the sub - dominant terms in maxey - riley - gatignol equation are neglected ( @xcite ) .",
    "a minimal model , used to address particle lagrangian dynamics in highly turbulent suspensions , takes into account only a few ingredients : the stokes drag , the auton added mass and the fluid acceleration term ( @xcite ) .",
    "this leads to : @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are respectively the fluid and the particle density , @xmath18 the fluid kinematic viscosity and @xmath19 the radius of the particle , which is considered spherical .",
    "however , the size of the particle in the above equation is essentially _",
    "virtual_. equation ( [ ppmodel ] ) contains only a time - scale , namely the particle relaxation time @xmath20 , which embodies a particle length - scale merely in combination with the kinematic viscosity of the flow and with the densities coefficients , i.e. , @xmath21 . in practice ,",
    "the drag term in equation ( [ ppmodel ] ) performs a purely temporal filtering of the flow velocity fluctuations .",
    "it is the role of faxn terms to account for the non - uniformity of the flow at the particle - size .",
    "faxn forces represent necessary physical corrections when analyzing the behavior of @xmath3 particles in turbulence . the faxn theorem for the drag force on a moving sphere states the relation @xmath22 where the integral is over surface of the sphere and @xmath23 the nonhomogeneous steady motion of the fluid in the absence of the sphere .",
    "as later shown by @xcite , faxn force corrections via sphere volume averages should also be included on the inertial hydrodynamic forces acting on the sphere .",
    "in particular the expression for the fluid acceleration and added mass force becomes : @xmath24 where similarly as above @xmath25 denotes the volume average over the spherical particle .",
    "putting together the two force contributions of eqs .",
    "( [ fd])-([fa ] ) into an equation of motion for a sphere , @xmath26 , and keeping into account the auton added mass correction for finite @xmath27 , i.e. , @xmath28 , we obtain the phenomenological faxn - corrected equation of motion : @xmath29    in the small particle limit , when @xmath30 , corrections can be approximated by taylor expansion @xmath31 ; @xmath32 , therefore the first order faxn correction accounts for the curvature of the unperturbed flow at the particle location . in a turbulent flow",
    "the correction term becomes important when @xmath33 , with a weak taylor - based reynolds number @xmath34 dependence . with the assumption @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the taylor microscale",
    ", one can roughly estimate @xmath37 .",
    "we adopt here a further approximation which allows efficient numerical computations of eq .",
    "( [ fcmodel ] ) .",
    "volume averages at particles positions are substituted by local interpolations after filtering by a gaussian envelope with standard deviation , @xmath38 , proportional to the particle radius .",

    "the surface average is obtained using the exact relation : @xmath44 which leads to : @xmath45,\\ ] ] where : @xmath46 .",
    "it can be shown that with the choice @xmath47 , the gaussian convolution gives the right prefactors for the faxn correction in the limit @xmath48 .",
    "our simplified approach for the integration of ( [ fcmodel ] ) ( fc model ) allows to track inertial particles in turbulent flows with minimal additional computational costs as compared to eq .",
    "( [ ppmodel ] ) ( pp model ) : the fluid acceleration and velocity fields are filtered once for every particle radius size , then the averaged flow at the particle positions are obtained through a tri - linear interpolation .",
    "we track particles via eq .",

    "the navier - stokes equation is discretized on a regular grid , integrated using a pseudo - spectral algorithm , and advanced in time with a @xmath49 order adams - bashford integrator .",
    "we have explored in a systematic way the two - dimensional parameter space @xmath50 $ ] in the range @xmath51 $ ] and @xmath52 $ ] for a turbulent flow at @xmath53 ( @xmath54 collocation points ) .",
    "we tracked @xmath55 particles for a total of @xmath56 large - eddy turnover time in statistically stationary conditions .",
    "lower resolution dns at @xmath57 @xmath58 have been used to explore a larger parameter space and to study the differences between the point - particle model ( [ ppmodel ] ) and the faxn corrected model ( [ fcmodel ] ) in the asymptote @xmath59 ( with @xmath60 the turbulence integral - scale ) .",
    "the validation of the numerics have been performed through careful comparison with an independent code implementing the same algorithm for particles , but with different forcing scheme , temporal integration method ( verlet algorithm ) , and local interpolation scheme ( tri - cubic algorithm ) .",

    "we compare the statistics of acceleration of particles tracked via the pp and fc equations . in the small particle limit ( @xmath69 )",
    "the two model equations behave the same way and the particle trajectory becomes the one of a fluid tracer .",
    "the ensemble - average acceleration variance reaches the value @xmath70 with the subscript @xmath71 labeling the fluid tracer acceleration . as the particle diameter",
    "is increased we notice important differences between the two models . in the pp model the drag term becomes negligible and one gets @xmath72 , with @xmath73 . in the fc model",
    "the volume average of the fluid acceleration @xmath74 reduces progressively the particle acceleration .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ figure1 ] ( left ) , where the particle acceleration variance ( normalized by @xmath75 ) is shown for three cases : neutral buoyant , heavy ( @xmath76 ) and light ( @xmath77 ) particles .",
    "we note that the behavior of @xmath78 for particles whose diameter is roughly larger than @xmath79 seems to be identical apart from the scaling factor @xmath80 .",
    "differences are also present in higher order moments : for this we focus on the flatness @xmath81 . in the large @xmath2 limit pp model",
    "gives the rather unphysical behavior @xmath82 , that is to say large particles , irrespectively of their density , show the same level of intermittency as a fluid tracer . on the other hand",
    "the faxn corrected equation gives asymptotically @xmath83 , i.e. , the gaussian flatness value , meaning that acceleration of large particles independently of their mass density value has lost its intermittent character , see fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ( right ) .",
    "furthermore , it is noticeable that above a certain critical value of the diameter the flatness of heavy / neutral and light particles reaches the same level : this suggests that also the pdfs may have very similar shapes .",
    "we study now how the fc model compares with the experimental observations listed in the introduction  recalling than none is captured by the pp model .    .",
    "inset : @xmath84 vs. @xmath85 from the same dns and exp * measurements . ]      in figure [ figure2 ] the behavior of the one - component acceleration variance , normalized by the heisenberg - yaglom scaling , @xmath86 , is displayed .",
    "although this way of normalizing the acceleration has a weak reynolds number dependence ( see @xcite ) we notice a very similar behavior as compared to the experimental measurements at @xmath87 by @xcite and with @xmath88 experiments by @xcite . in the inset of figure [ figure2 ] the same quantity but with a different normalization is shown .",
    "the particle acceleration variance there is divided by the second moment of fluid tracer acceleration @xmath89 .",
    "the experimental data from @xcite can also be rescaled in the same way by dividing @xmath90 by the value for the smallest considered particle ( which has size @xmath91 and essentially behaves as a fluid tracer ) .",
    "this alternate way of looking at the data renormalizes the weak @xmath34 dependence , providing a good agreement between the dns and experiments even when comparing results with one order of magnitude difference in @xmath34 .    in a dns",
    "one can estimate the relative weight of the terms contributing to the total acceleration : the drag and fluid acceleration terms , respectively : @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "it is important to note that in the case of neutrally buoyant particles , one finds @xmath94 with percent accuracy .",
    "it indicates that the observed effect - decrease of particle acceleration variance for increasing particle diameter - comes uniquely from volume averaging of fluid acceleration at the particle position .",
    "the drag contribution is sub - leading at all @xmath2 values ( from few percent up to 15% of total acceleration variance ) ; it just contributes to compensate the @xmath95 correlations .",
    "stated differently , one can say that the acceleration of a finite - size neutrally buoyant particle is essentially given by @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the stress tensor , @xmath98 a unit norm vector pointing outward the sphere and @xmath99 the external large - scale forcing whose contribution @xmath100 is negligible at the particle scale .",
    "one expects the situation to be different for particles whose density does not match that of the fluid .",
    "our simulations are consistent with the @xmath101 scaling which has been proposed on the basis of dimensional arguments rooted on kolmogorov 1941 turbulence phenomenology without special assumptions on particle dynamics ( @xcite ) ; however at @xmath53 the scale - separation is still too limited to observe a true scaling range .     and",

    "the second quantity under study is the acceleration probability density function . here , to cope with @xmath34 effects ,",
    "one compares only the two most similar data sets : the dns at @xmath53 and the experiment at @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "experiments have revealed a universal behavior for acceleration pdf normalized by @xmath103 in the size - range @xmath104 .",
    "dns instead shows a systematic difference in the their trend : larger particles have less intermittent acceleration statistics , see figure [ figure3 ] ( top ) .",
    "however , the shape of the pdf in the limit of large particles @xmath105 shows a good similarity . to better visualize differences , in figure [ figure3 ] ( bottom ) , we show the flatness @xmath106 vs. particle diameter for dns and experiments . as already observed , the fc model leads to decreasing intermittency for bigger neutral particles , and in the asymptotic limit @xmath107 to gaussian distribution ; also acceleration flatness is an increasing function of @xmath34 .",
    "qureshi and coworkers experiment on the other hand shows a @xmath2-independent behavior around @xmath108 . a further possible source of differences",
    "can be connected to the variations in the large scale properties of turbulent flows : experimental tracks come from a decaying grid - generated turbulence , simulations instead uses volume large - scale forced flow in a cubic domain without mean flow .      finally , we consider the dynamics of the neutral particles .",
    "we study the normalized one - component correlation function , @xmath109 . in @xcite",
    "it has been noted that pp model can not account for the increasing autocorrelation for larger particles .",
    "this is understood from equation ( [ ppmodel ] ) : in the large @xmath2 limit the drag term is negligible and the acceleration of a neutrally buoyant particle is dominated by the inertial term @xmath110 .",
    "therefore the time - correlation of acceleration , @xmath111 , is related to the temporal correlation of @xmath110 along the particle trajectory . because in the large @xmath2 limit @xmath112 ( @xcite ) , one expects an acceleration correlation time which is equal or even shorter than the one of a fluid tracer .",
    "this is confirmed by our numerics based on the pp equation ( [ ppmodel ] ) . in the fc model instead , the averaged quantity @xmath113 dominates the particle s acceleration and so its time correlation @xmath111 . in figure [ figure4 ]",
    "we show that simulations based on eq .",
    "( [ fcmodel ] ) display increasing correlation time for bigger particles , as observed in experiment ( @xcite , although at much larger @xmath34 values ) .",
    "a detailed comparison of @xmath111 curves coming from dnss with experiments by qureshi and coworkers is at present not possible , because of limited statistics .",
    "therefore , we examine integral quantities such as an integral acceleration time , @xmath114 . since by kinematic constraint the time integral of @xmath111 for a small tracer is zero , we define @xmath114 as the integral over time of the positive part of @xmath111 ; this choice proves to be stable in the experiments and weakly dependent on the unavoidable ( gaussian ) smoothing of noisy data sets ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the result of this analysis is reported in figure [ figure4 ] ( inset ) .",
    "the order of magnitude of @xmath115 , which is very near unity , as well its increasing trend with @xmath2 qualitatively confirms the prediction of the fc model at similar reynolds number . using dns results ,",
    "it is also interesting to note that this time decreases with increasing reynolds number .     for neutral particles @xmath116 , with different sizes @xmath117 and a tracer particle .",

    "we have investigated the origin of several experimental observations concerning neutrally - buoyant finite - size particle acceleration in turbulent flows and shown the relevance of faxn corrections .",
    "faxn terms account for inhomogeneities in the fluid flow at the spatial extension of the particle .",
    "they act as spatial coarse - graining of the surrounding turbulent flow , in contrast with the drag term which performs a temporal filtering .",
    "numerically , the spatial average is efficiently implemented via gaussian filtering in spectral space . comparing with experimental measurements ,",
    "the main achievements of the faxn - corrected model are : ( i ) prediction of the reduction of acceleration fluctuations at increasing the particle size ; ( ii ) prediction of the increasing of acceleration time correlation at increasing the particle size .",
    "both effects originate from the volume average of the fluid acceleration term , or in other word from the surface average of the stress tensor of the unperturbed flow .",
    "while giving the correct trend , the fc model does not solve the puzzling point of invariant pdf with particle size , observed by @xcite .",
    "the faxn corrected model marks a substantial improvement in the statistical description of realistic turbulent particle suspensions .",
    "we emphasize that none of the observed trends in the acceleration of neutrally buoyant particles can be captured by purely local models , as e.g. the point - particle one in eq .",
    "( [ ppmodel ] ) .",
    "faxn corrections are of highest relevance in the case of neutrally buoyant particles , because it is the case for which the slip velocity ( @xmath123 ) is the smallest ( as compared to @xmath124 particles ) and therefore where drag , history , lift have the least impact on the net force . in our case",
    "we observe that when increasing the size of particles , the pdfs of slip velocity normalized by the fluid velocity rms value ( @xmath125 ) change from a sharp delta - like shape ( for tracers ) to larger distributions approaching a gaussian ( for large particles ) . a size - dependent slip velocity for neutrally buoyant tracers in chaotic flows has been reported recently in @xcite : faxn corrections to the added mass",
    "should be significant in that case too .",
    "we also observe that the particle - reynolds number @xmath14 measured in our simulations attains values in the order of the hundreds , hence a more accurate description of the drag coefficient ( see for instance @xcite ) may be important particularly for a faithful reproduction of the far tails of the acceleration pdf .    _ acknowledgments : _ the authors acknowledge the grenoble team ( n. m. qureshi , c. baudet , a. cartellier and y. gagne ) for generously sharing their experimental data measurements , and j.bec for useful discussions .",
