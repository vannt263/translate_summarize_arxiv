    "in the last decade , during the advent of network science , a number of statistical descriptions were proposed to characterize the structure of the interactions of many diverse complex systems @xcite .",
    "one of the most fundamental features when characterizing the structure of a network is the size of its giant connected component , _",
    "i.e. _ , the size of the largest subset of vertices so that each pair of them is connected by a path of finite length .",
    "the existence of a giant connected component is particularly important in those networks carrying flows of different natures , such as viruses and rumours in social systems , data in technological networks or goods and humans in transportation systems .",
    "thus , the maximum capacity for the spread and transport in such systems is limited by the size of the giant connected component .",
    "apart from this practical meaning , the giant connected component is the relevant order parameter that shows the formation of a macroscopic cluster in the context of ordinary percolation @xcite .    apart from ordinary percolation , which leads to a continuous phase transition for the emergence of a macroscopic giant connected component , a number of generalizations to the usual scenario were introduced .",
    "these variants lead to other kinds of giant connected components , whose emergence is associated with different phase transitions @xcite . among these generalizations",
    "is @xmath0-core percolation , in which a giant @xmath0-core exists if the vertex mean degree of the network exceeds some threshold @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-core of a complex network is defined as the largest subgraph whose vertices have degree at least @xmath0 .",
    "thus , each two vertices in the @xmath0-core are interconnected by at least @xmath0 paths , which may partially overlap with each other",
    ".    the @xmath0-core of a given graph can be obtained by a recursive pruning algorithm that , at each step , removes all existing vertices with degrees less than @xmath0 . as the result of this pruning ,",
    "the network is decomposed into a hierarchical set of progressively enclosed @xmath0-cores with the highest @xmath0-core being placed in the center .",
    "the application of this graph decomposition technique to large real - world networks allows to describe qualitatively their structure in terms of the complete set of their @xmath0-cores @xcite .",
    "moreover , it was shown that the most efficient vertices in spreading processes are those belonging to higher @xmath0-cores of a network @xcite .",
    "for these reasons , during the last years the @xmath0-core organization of complex networks has been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "the most remarkable result is that for @xmath10 , a @xmath0-core emerges discontinuously at the percolation threshold through a hybrid phase transition , combining a discontinuity and a critical singularity and thus breaking the usual continuous scenario of ordinary percolation .",
    "very recently , it has been considered that most of real - world networks are not isolated objects but composed of many coupled , interdependent networks such that the function of one network depends on the others @xcite . for such networks ,",
    "the pruning of vertices in one network can lead to removal of dependent vertices in other networks .",
    "it was found that generalized percolation properties of these interdependent networks differ strongly from ordinary percolation on a single network @xcite .",
    "in fact , they more resemble features of k - core percolation in single networks including the hybrid phase transition .",
    "the simplest particular case of interdependent networks are multiplex networks in which each vertex depends on at most one vertex of other networks .",
    "multiplex networks can be treated as superpositions of several networks ( sometimes called layers ) with different edges @xcite . in other words ,",
    "all vertices in these networks are of the same type , but the edges are of different types ( colors ) .",
    "note that here a vertex not necessary has all types of connections .",
    "multiplexes have recently attracted a lot of attention as they are the kind of substrates representing better the interaction patterns occurring in many real systems , in which several ways for the interaction between the elements coexist .",
    "this is the case of transportation , social and technological networks among others .",
    "based on its ubiquity , the structural and dynamical properties of multiplexes have been studied in several contexts including diffusion @xcite , evolutionary games @xcite , boolean dynamics @xcite , epidemics @xcite and , of course , percolation @xcite . in this way , in @xcite , a giant viable component for multiplex networks is defined as a set of vertices in which , for every type of edges , each two vertices are interconnected by at least one path following only edges of this type . clearly , the giant viable component of a multiplex network is a subgraph of the giant connected components of all single networks ( layers ) .",
    "the theory of ordinary percolation on multiplex networks shows a hybrid transition which is the birth of the giant viable components , similar to what happens in @xmath0-core percolation on single networks .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite it was shown that the giant viable component is a subgraph of the so - called mutual component ( or mutually connected component ) . by definition",
    ", a vertex belongs to the mutual component if for every color of edges , which he has , at least one its nearest neighbor connected by an edge of this color is in the mutual component .",
    "since vertices may have among their edges , some of colors missed , some pairs of vertices in the mutual component may be interconnected by paths of incomplete set of the colors . in this paper",
    "we study the organization of specific subgraphs , @xmath1-cores for multiplex networks , where @xmath2 . generalizing the notion of a viable connected component",
    ", we define the @xmath1-viable component as a set of vertices , in which for each type @xmath11 of edges and for each two vertices , there are at least @xmath4 paths , following only edges of type @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath1-core is a giant @xmath1-viable component , where we must assume for each type @xmath11 of edges that @xmath12 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ s2 ]",
    ", we introduce an algorithm for the @xmath1-core decomposition of multiplex networks and present an analytical framework enabling us to describe the nature of the transitions corresponding to the emergence of @xmath1-cores with arbitrary @xmath13 .",
    "we apply our general results to the erds  rnyi and scale - free multiplex networks . in section  [ s3 ] , as an application to the real multiplexes , we apply the @xmath1-core algorithm to air - transportation multiplexes and compare the results with our analytical predictions .",
    "let us consider a multiplex network , having edges of types @xmath14 , with a given joint degree distribution @xmath15 and a locally tree - like structure in the infinite network limit . for simplicity , we assume that this network is completely uncorrelated , though , in principle",
    ", correlations between different edges , @xmath5 , of a vertex might be easily taken into account . to obtain the @xmath1-core of a multiplex network ,",
    "we use the following pruning algorithm : at each step we remove every vertex if for at least one type of edge @xmath11 , @xmath16 . as the result of the pruning , the degrees of some vertices change . if there are still vertices which one can prune , we remove them in the next step .",
    "the pruning is continued until no vertex remains of degree @xmath17 less than the threshold @xmath4 .",

    "the subtree of type @xmath11 is , by definition , a tree whose vertices have at least @xmath19 edges of type @xmath11 and at least @xmath20 edges of each of other types @xmath21 edges .",

    "also , when the exponent @xmath114 decreases , the transition point moves towards higher values of mean degree . in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] we compare the emergence of cores for scale - free and erds  rnyi networks .",
    "as one can see , the dependency of the cores on @xmath100 for these networks is similar and , as expected , the curves with larger @xmath114 approach to the result for erds  rnyi networks .",
    "the remarkable difference between figs .",
    "[ f3 ] and [ f4 ] for different scale - free multiplex networks points out that , similarly to ordinary @xmath0-cores , the @xmath1-cores essentially depend on the low - degree parts of the degree distributions .",
    "as an example of real multiplex networks , we consider air - transportation networks , in which vertices represent airports and edges direct flight connections between airports . since flights can be operated by different airlines , a detailed representation of this kind of systems is given by multiplexes @xcite .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we consider air - transportation multiplexes composed of two types of edges ( two different airlines ) . among the possible choices for composing these multiplexes , we have considered both low - cost airlines and major carriers .",
    "the main difference between the organization of these airlines is that low - cost companies diversify their main airports across and their goal is mainly driven by the economic growth .",
    "instead major carriers are typically associated to one country as they are originally designed to serve the national and international mobility of the corresponding citizens .",
    "these major airlines are thus designed following the so - called _ hub - and - spoke _ structure in which one airport ( the hub ) is surrounded by many low degree vertices forming a kind of star - like graph .",
    "we have considered three different types of multiplexes comprising : _ ( i ) _ two low - cost airlines , _ ( ii ) _ two major airlines , and _ ( iii ) _ one low - cost and one major airline . in particular , we have considered these combinations : @xmath128 and @xmath129 ( combination of two low - cost airlines ) , @xmath130 ( combination of two major airlines ) and @xmath131 ( combination of low - cost and major airlines ) .    fig .",

    "the common vertices have a few connections for each type of edges , which are removed in the first steps of @xmath132core algorithm .",
    "hence , this multiplex network has only a few cores .",
    "similarly , the @xmath130 multiplex network has a few cores , since these two major airlines operate from different countries and thus the connectivity of the overlapping vertices is very different .    in fig .",
    "[ f6 ] , we have compared the size of the @xmath93-core and the @xmath127-core for air - transportation multiplex networks with the corresponding analytical results , obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ eq4])([eq5 ] ) in which we made use of the degree distributions of the empirical multiplex networks .",
    "as one can see , in some cases there is a noticeable difference between theory and reality , which arises from clustering , degree - degree correlations , and structural motifs in real - world networks , which we did not take into account .",
    "furthermore , the effects of overlapping between edges from different layers in the real - world multiplex networks can also be significant as noted in @xcite .",
    "in this work we have generalized the theory of @xmath1-core percolation to the multiplex networks .",
    "our aim is to present a pruning algorithm for the @xmath1-core decomposition of multiplex networks that may be useful for describing the topological structure of these networks . to this aim",
    ", we introduced a @xmath1-viable component and showed that the @xmath1-core is the giant @xmath1-viable component if @xmath133 for each type of edges . in this case , for each two vertices in the @xmath1-viable component there are at least @xmath4 paths , following only edges of type @xmath11 , joining them .",
    "we have analytically solved the @xmath1-core percolation problem for multiplex networks with arbitrary degree distributions . in the particular case of @xmath8-core ,",
    "the transition is continuous .",
    "this is not in contradiction with previous results for ordinary percolation on multiplex networks , because in this case the @xmath8-core is not a @xmath1-viable component .",
    "we showed however that the transitions for higher cores are hybrid .",
    "noticeably , although the @xmath82 and @xmath134-cores are not viable , they also display hybrid transitions .",
    "moreover we found that the @xmath135-core on uncorrelated multiplex networks has a higher threshold than the @xmath4-core on the counterpart single networks .",
    "hence , we conclude that multiplex networks are less robust compared to their counterpart single networks , if we analyse the destruction of the @xmath1-cores induced by random removal of vertices .    in summary , the @xmath1-core problem for the multiplex networks turns out to be essentially richer than the @xmath0-core problem for single networks .",
    "the pruning algorithm allows one to extract the @xmath1-cores in the multiplex networks in an easier way than their viable components .",
    "so the @xmath1-core decomposition of these complex networks is algorithmically efficient . in the analytical framework presented here",
    ", we focused on uncorrelated and locally tree - like multiplex networks , ignoring the overlap of different types of edges , clustering , and correlations .",
