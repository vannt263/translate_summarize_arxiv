    "the interaction of electrons with phonons is of practical and fundamental interest in graphene , as it not only affects the transport properties of actual devices  @xcite , but also induces novel phenomena such as charge density waves  @xcite and superconductivity  @xcite .",
    "hence the manipulation of the electron - phonon coupling is an important issue to realize graphene - based electronic and spintronic devices  @xcite and to create new strongly correlated electron phases .",
    "in fact , several methods have been proposed to modify the electron - phonon coupling constant , @xmath2 , of graphene using charge carrier density  @xcite , magnetic field  @xcite , disorder  @xcite , and adatoms  @xcite . among them",
    ", the change of charge carrier density can tune the strength of electron - phonon coupling up to @xmath2@xmath10.05  @xcite , while electron - electron interactions are efficiently suppressed  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the presence of adatoms is predicted to drastically enhance electron - phonon coupling up to @xmath2=0.61  @xcite , so that graphene enters the regime where phonon - mediated superconductivity might exist  @xcite .",
    "however , experimental evidence of this striking enhancement in graphene has been controversial so far .",
    "the most prominent manifestation of the electron - phonon coupling is a renormalization or kink of the electronic band structure at the phonon energy accompanied by a change in the charge carrier scattering rate .",
    "these effects are directly observed using angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes )  @xcite .",
    "however , experimental studies on the role of adatoms for the electron - phonon coupling of graphene via arpes have been debated due to the hybridization of the adatom band with the graphene @xmath0 bands , referred to as band structure effect , resulting in an apparent enhancement and anisotropy of the electron - phonon coupling strength  @xcite . on the other hand , strong enhancement of the electron - phonon coupling through adatom intercalation have been reported for graphite , and discussed in same cases as the driver for superconductivity  @xcite .",
    "these previous results suggest the importance of combining experimental and theoretical studies to understand the enhancement of electron - phonon coupling in graphene .    here",
    "we present high - resolution arpes study showing a strong enhancement of the electron - phonon coupling strength in a monolayer graphene sheet via yb adsorption .",
    "a direct comparison with the theoretical band structure determined by first principles calculations show that the yb 6@xmath3 electrons transferred to the graphene layer are hybridized with the graphene @xmath0 bands , resulting in an enhanced electron - phonon coupling from @xmath2=0.05 for as grown graphene to @xmath2=0.43 for graphene with yb .",

    "<S> we present high - resolution angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy study in conjunction with first principles calculations to investigate how the interaction of electrons with phonons in graphene is modified by the presence of yb . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the transferred charges from yb to the graphene layer hybridize with the graphene @xmath0 bands , leading to a strong enhancement of the electron - phonon interaction . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , the electron - phonon coupling constant is increased by as much as a factor of 10 upon the introduction of yb with respect to as grown graphene ( @xmath10.05 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the observed coupling constant constitutes the highest value ever measured for graphene and suggests that the hybridization between graphene and the adatoms might be a critical parameter in realizing superconducting graphene . </S>"
