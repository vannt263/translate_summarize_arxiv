    "when the photon is emitted collinearly to the final state charged lepton , this process needs to be fully understood when trying to extract a precise value of the @xmath1 boson mass from tevatron data .",

    "radiative @xmath1 decay events shift the @xmath1 mass by about 65  mev in the electron , and by approximately 170  mev in the muon channel  @xcite .    for similar reasons ,",

    "@xmath12 production is sensitive to the structure of the @xmath3 quartic coupling  @xcite . furthermore , as a consequence of a general theorem  @xcite one expects a radiation zero in the sm @xmath13 amplitude .",
    "two photon radiation is expected to have a non - negligible effect on the @xmath1 mass extracted from future high precision tevatron data because approximately 0.8% of all @xmath9 events are expected to contain two well separated photons with @xmath14  mev  @xcite .",
    "finally , @xmath12 production is an irreducible background to associated production of a @xmath1 and a higgs boson in hadronic collisions , if the higgs boson decays into two photons  @xcite .    in @xmath15 collisions at a center of mass energy of 2  tev ,",
    "the total cross section for @xmath16 production is approximately 4.6  fb , when only considering leptonic decays , @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) , and @xmath19  gev and @xmath20 ( @xmath21 being the pseudorapidity )  @xcite .",
    "upgrades of the tevatron accelerator complex ( tev33 ) , beyond the main injector project , could yield an overall integrated luminosity of @xmath22  fb@xmath23 )  @xcite , making a study of @xmath12 production a realistic goal in the tev33 era .",
    "the hadronic decay modes of the @xmath1 will be difficult to observe due to the qcd @xmath24 background  @xcite .",
    "we therefore concentrate on the leptonic decays of the @xmath1 boson , and calculate the helicity amplitudes for the complete process @xmath25 including feynman diagrams where one or both photons are emitted from the final state charged lepton line . in a realistic simulation , these diagrams , together with finite @xmath1 width effects , need to be taken into account .    when including finite @xmath1 width effects , some care is needed to preserve gauge invariance .",
    "replacing the @xmath1 propagator , @xmath26 , by a breit - wigner form , @xmath27 , will disturb the gauge cancellations between the individual feynman graphs and thus lead to an amplitude which is not electromagnetically gauge invariant .",

    "finite detector resolution effects further dilute the radiation zero .",
    "the twofold ambiguity in reconstructing the parton center of mass frame originates from the nonobservation of the neutrino arising from @xmath1 decay . identifying the missing transverse energy with the transverse momentum of the neutrino ,",
    "the unobservable longitudinal neutrino momentum , @xmath41 , and thus the parton center of mass frame , can be reconstructed by imposing the constraint that the neutrino and charged lepton four momenta combine to form the @xmath1 rest mass  @xcite .",
    "the resulting quadratic equation , in general , has two solutions . finally , determining the @xmath40 distribution requires measurement of the missing transverse energy in the event . in future",
    "tevatron runs , one expects up to ten interactions per bunch crossing  @xcite .",
    "multiple interactions per crossing significantly worsen the missing transverse energy resolution , and thus tend to wash out the dip caused by the radiation zero .    for @xmath12 production , the same problems arise .",
    "in addition , it is very difficult to experimentally separate two collinear photons , and , thus , to distinguish the @xmath12 signal from @xmath28 events and from the @xmath42  jets background , where one of the jets fluctuates into a @xmath43 which decays into two almost collinear photons .",
    "one therefore has to search for a signal of the radiation zero which survives an explicit photon  photon separation requirement .    in ref .",

    "it is reasonable , however , to take the known nlo qcd correction to @xmath28 production as a guide  @xcite . at @xmath223",
    "the virtual corrections only enter via their interference with the born amplitude , and thus the radiation zero is preserved in the product . among the real emission corrections ,",
    "quark - antiquark annihilation processes dominate at tevatron energies . according to the theorem of ref .",
    "@xcite , extra gluon emission , _",
    "i.e. _ the process @xmath224 , exhibits a radiation zero at @xmath225 if the gluon is collinear to all emitted photons , and also in the soft gluon limit , @xmath226 ( again , provided the photons are collinear ) .",
    "this leaves quark - gluon initiated processes to potentially spoil the radiation zero .",
    "they are still suppressed at the tevatron , however , especially when a large photon - jet separation is required . as a result , we expect the dip signaling the radiation amplitude zero to remain observable , at tevatron energies , once nlo corrections are included .    at the lhc ( @xmath227 collisions at @xmath228  tev  @xcite ) , the bulk of the qcd corrections to @xmath12 production originates from quark gluon fusion and the kinematical region where the final state quark radiates a soft @xmath1 boson which is almost collinear to the quark .",
    "events which originate from this phase space region usually contain a high @xmath102 jet .",
    "since there is no radiation zero present in the dominating @xmath229 and @xmath230 processes , it is likely that qcd corrections considerably obscure the signal of the @xmath12 radiation zero at the lhc , as in the @xmath28 case  @xcite .",
    "this conjecture is supported by the large relative cross section of @xmath231  jet production as compared to @xmath12 production reported in ref .",
    "although a jet veto should help reducing the size of the qcd corrections , nlo qcd corrections to @xmath232  jet production may still significantly reduce the observability of the radiation zero for jet definition criteria which are realistic at lhc energies .",
    "we therefore do not consider @xmath108 production at the lhc in more detail here .",
    "we have presented a calculation of the process @xmath140 including final state bremsstrahlung diagrams and finite @xmath1 width effects , and explored the prospects to observe the radiation zero predicted by the sm for @xmath233 in future tevatron collider experiments . in order to obtain a gauge invariant scattering amplitude ,",
    "the imaginary parts of the @xmath2 triangle graphs and @xmath3 box diagrams have to be included , in addition to resumming the imaginary contributions to the @xmath1 vacuum polarization .",
    "the imaginary parts of the triangle and box diagrams were found to change the lowest order @xmath2 and @xmath3 vertex functions by a factor @xmath234 for the momentum configuration relevant for the process @xmath235 . a gauge invariant result for the @xmath235 amplitude",
    "is then obtained by replacing all @xmath1 propagators , @xmath2 and @xmath3 vertices by the full expressions of eqs .",
    "( [ wprop ] ) , ( [ wwgvertex ] ) and  ( [ wwggvertex ] ) , respectively .",
    "the same prescription also ensures that the ward identities relating the @xmath31 and @xmath236 , @xmath237 , vertex functions are fulfilled , and thus yield a gauge invariant amplitude for @xmath238 with @xmath239 , without taking into account one - loop corrections to these higher vertex functions .",
    "the sm predicts the existence of a radiation zero in @xmath240 at @xmath241 if the two photons are collinear .",
    "here @xmath156 is the angle between the @xmath1 and the incoming quark in the parton center of mass frame .",
    "since it is very difficult to experimentally separate two collinear photons , one has to search for a signal of the radiation zero which survives an explicit photon  photon separation requirement .",
    "contributions from feynman diagrams where one or both photons are emitted by the final state charged lepton eliminate the radiation zero and therefore need to be suppressed by suitable cuts .",
    "we found that a large lepton ",
    "photon separation of @xmath242 , together with a cut on the @xmath141 transverse mass of @xmath243  gev suppresses these contributions sufficiently .",
    "the @xmath12 radiation zero is signaled by a pronounced dip in the @xmath160 distribution if one requires @xmath185 .",
    "in contrast , no dip is present for @xmath186 . in order to measure the @xmath40 distribution ,",
    "the parton center of mass frame has to be reconstructed . since the neutrino originating from the @xmath1 decay",
    "is not observed in the detector , this is only possible modulo a twofold ambiguity .",
    "the two solutions can be ordered according to whether the reconstructed rapidity of the neutrino is larger ( `` plus '' solution ) or smaller ( `` minus '' solution ) than the rapidity of the charged lepton . for @xmath92 ( @xmath94 )",
    "production , the `` minus '' ( `` plus '' ) solution is found to best represent the expected kinematical features .",
    "when searching for the radiation zero in @xmath12 production it is advantageous to consider alternate variables which , unlike the @xmath160 distribution , do not depend on the neutrino momentum .",
    "the rapidity difference between the two - photon system and the electron , _",
    "i.e. _ the @xmath192 distribution , fulfills this requirement .",
    "it was found to exhibit a pronounced dip which signals the presence of the radiation zero if a @xmath46 cut is imposed ( @xmath47 being the opening angle between the two photons in the laboratory system ) .",
    "as expected , the @xmath192 distribution shows no dip for @xmath212 . a photon  photon separation cut of @xmath122 has little effect on the observability of the radiation zero .",
    "although we have restricted our discussion to @xmath108 production , our results also apply to @xmath244 .    the conditions for which one expects a radiation zero in the sm @xmath245 and @xmath7 amplitudes and the location of the zeros are closely related : the four - momentum of the photon in @xmath28 production simply has to be replaced by the four - momentum of the @xmath5 system in the @xmath12 case with the additional requirement that the two photons are collinear .",
    "we have demonstrated that a similar replacement in the @xmath28 photon  lepton rapidity difference distribution , with the less stringent requirement on the opening angle between the photons of @xmath46 , is in fact sufficient to produce an observable signal of the @xmath12 radiation zero ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : xraz0 ] ) .",
    "nlo qcd corrections to @xmath233 are expected to be modest at tevatron energies .",
