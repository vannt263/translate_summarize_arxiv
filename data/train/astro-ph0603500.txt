    ", luminosity distance must be determined in this theory .",
    "secondly , we need to model correctly the variation of matter density with redshift in the universe . in the following ,",
    "we determine a few key relations that are used in the subsequent analysis",
    ". then we compare the theoretical distance modulii with those measured , resulting in a good fit without the need to assume the existence of dark energy or dark matter .",
    "suppose @xmath8 is the total energy emitted per unit time by a source galaxy at the epoch @xmath6 ( that is , in the rest frame of the galaxy ) to be received by an observer at the present time @xmath9 .",
    "therefore we can write @xmath10 where @xmath11 is its ( normalized ) intensity distribution  a function of wavelength @xmath12 . in cgr , times at cosmological distances add according to a relativistic addition law @xcite when referred to the observer at @xmath13 . hence instead of the time interval @xmath14",
    ", we get @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the hubble - carmeli time constant . from this",
    "it can be shown @xcite that the luminosity @xmath17 of a source at the present time is related to the luminosity @xmath8 of an identical source which emitted at time @xmath6 by @xmath18 for the source at distance @xmath19 , redshift @xmath20 , emission wavelength @xmath21 and the luminosity ( [ eq : luminosity ] ) , it is straight forward to show @xcite that the observed flux integrated over all wavelengths is @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the absolute bolometric luminosity of the source galaxy .",
    "therefore the luminosity distance @xmath24 in cgr is expressed as @xmath25    it is clear that this expression for the luminosity distance in cgr when compared to that in the frw theory has the extra factor @xmath26 .",
    "hence we expect the luminosity distance to be greater in cgr than in frw theory .",
    "the line element in cgr @xcite @xmath27 represents a spherically symmetric isotropic universe .",

    "the expansion is observed at a definite time and therefore @xmath28 and hence does nt appear in ( [ eqn : lineelement ] ) .",

    "also @xmath34 can be written as a function of redshift @xmath35    now in cgr there is no scale factor like in the frw theory but we can similarly define an expansion factor as @xmath36 . if we then make the substitution for the matter density @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the matter density at the current epoch , the proper distance ( [ eqn : rctau ] ) can be rewritten as a function of @xmath39 , @xmath40    for a proper comparison with frw theory we must use the frw equivalent of @xmath41 , which is the hubble distance @xmath42 when the light we observe left the galaxy at redshift @xmath20 and is given by @xmath43 where a deceleration parameter @xmath44 has been used .",
    "the angular size of the source galaxy in frw theory is @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the actual diameter of the source galaxy and the angular distance @xmath42 is taken from ( [ eqn : rfrw ] ) .    in cgr the angular distance @xmath47",

    "equating fluxes from ( [ eq : bol ] ) and ( [ eqn : fthetacgr ] ) , substituting for @xmath51 from ( [ eqn : dthetacgr ] ) and substituting @xmath55 with @xmath56 the source temperature we get @xmath57 since for a blackbody at temperature @xmath58 the radiation with average wavelength @xmath12 has energy @xmath59 where @xmath60 is boltzmann s constant and since the wavelength varies with redshift as @xmath61 this implies @xmath62 .",
    "we assume that this holds even for a galaxy source which may not be a perfect blackbody .",

    "previously one of us @xcite , which used some of the same data but with a different density model , the @xmath137/n parameters appear to be much smaller and therefore represent better quality fits than in the former .",
    "however this is not actually the case , as a software algorithm was used in @xcite that did nt properly calculate @xmath137 .",
    "the problem with the analysis was that the errors for all data were set to unity , that is , @xmath141 . in oliveira and hartnett",
    "@xcite we calculated the correct @xmath134 parameters using ( [ eqn : chisq ] ) and published errors .",

    "the improvement has resulted from the additional factor @xmath26 in the luminosity distance and a little from the refinement of the density model @xmath66 .",
    "if we exclude the new density model and use @xmath144 where @xmath145 instead , we get @xmath146 for the best fit to the combined data set requiring @xmath147 .",
    "this indicates the improvement over hartnett @xcite is more the result of the additional factor in the luminosity distance than the better density model .",
    "looking at the curve fits of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] where the distance modulus vs redshift curves with both @xmath148 and @xmath126 are shown , it is quite clear that using the carmeli theory a universe with @xmath126 is ruled out and hence also the need for any dark matter .",
    "this is even more obvious from the residuals shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] .",
    "there the fit with @xmath148 is drawn along the @xmath149 axis and the fit with @xmath126 is shown as a broken line .",
    "the highest redshift data clearly rules out such high matter density in the universe .",
    "the best fit result of this paper , @xmath136 , with a density function that is valid for all @xmath20 over the range of observations , is also consistent with the result obtained by hartnett @xcite @xmath150 but here the 1 @xmath53 errors are significantly reduced .",
    "with the best fit @xmath151 , the predicted expansion transition redshift from ( [ eq : beta_at_omega=1 ] ) is @xmath152 this is about a factor of @xmath153 greater than the fitted value reported by riess _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite of @xmath154 , which was from a best fit to the differenced distance modulus data , a second order effect .",
    "they used a luminosity distance relation assuming a flat euclidean space ( i.e. , @xmath155 ) and fit the difference data with the deceleration parameter @xmath156 .    in the present theory ,",
    "the transition redshift @xmath4 is inherently where the density parameter @xmath157 .",
    "thus , the transition is determined simultaneously with the initial fit of @xmath49 to the data .",
    "moreover @xmath38 has been determined as a ` hubble constant free ' parameter because it comes from @xmath158 , which is evaluated from fits using ( [ eqn : magnitude ] ) .",
    "the latter is independent of the hubble constant or more precisely in this theory @xmath159 the hubble - carmeli time constant .",
    "therefore @xmath38 should be compared with @xmath160 and not with @xmath161 , where @xmath162 is the hubble constant as a fraction of @xmath163 and not to be confused with @xmath164 used in cgr .",
    "nevertheless the value of @xmath165 from @xcite and @xmath166 ( assuming a value of @xmath167 ) implies @xmath168 , which is in good agreement with the results of this work . yet",
    "caution must be advised as the problem of the analysis of the wmap data has not yet been attempted within the framework of cgr .",
    "using the small redshift limit of ( [ eqn : rctau ] ) and the hubble law at small redshift ( @xmath169 ) it has been shown @xcite that the hubble parameter @xmath170 varies with redshift .",
    "if it applies at the low redshift limit it follows from the theory that at high redshift we can write @xmath171 therefore @xmath172 in this model is redshift dependent , not constant and @xmath173 . only @xmath174 is truly independent of redshift and constant .",
    "the condition where @xmath175 only occurs at @xmath176 and where @xmath177 .    by plotting @xmath172 values determined as a function of redshift , using ( [ eqn : h0-h ] ) , it is possible to get an independent determination of @xmath162 , albeit the noise in the data is very large .",

    "separate curve fits from ( [ eqn : h0-h ] ) , with @xmath162 as a free parameter , have been applied to the two data sets , tully - fisher ( tf ) ( the solid line ) and sne type ia ( the broken line ) measurements . the former resulted in @xmath179 ( statistical ) @xmath180 ( rms ) @xmath181 and from the latter @xmath123 ( statistical ) @xmath182 ( rms ) @xmath181 .",

    "<S> several key relations are derived for cosmological general relativity which are used in standard observational cosmology . </S>",

    "<S> the best fit to the data for the local density parameter is @xmath1 . because @xmath2 is within the baryonic budget </S>",
    "<S> there is no need for any dark matter to account for the sne ia redshift luminosity data . from this local density </S>",
    "<S> it is determined that the redshift where the universe expansion transitions from deceleration to acceleration is @xmath3 . because the fitted data covers the range of the predicted transition redshift @xmath4 </S>",
