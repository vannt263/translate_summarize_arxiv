    "pulsar scintillations have been used to study the small - scale structure in the electron density in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "this microstructure covers a range of scales extending from @xmath4 km to at least 10 au following a kolmogorov - like wavenumber spectrum .",
    "that is , the slope of the three dimensional wavenumber spectrum is often estimated to be roughly @xmath5 , though there is also evidence that some lines of sight at some epochs show excess power in the wavenumber spectrum on scales near 1 au .",
    "the chief observable phenomena are intensity fluctuations in time and frequency ( interstellar scintillation or iss ) , angular broadening ( ` seeing ' ) , pulse broadening , and arrival time variations .",
    "these effects have been well studied in the three decades since pulsars were discovered .",
    "although refractive iss ( riss ) has also been recognized in compact extra - galactic radio sources , their larger angular sizes suppress the fine diffractive scintillations ( diss ) which probe the smallest scales in the medium .",
    "observers have long used dynamic spectra of pulsars to study the diffractive interstellar scintillation intensity versus time and frequency , @xmath6 .",
    "its two - dimensional correlation function is typically used to estimate the characteristic bandwidth and time scale for the scintillations .",
    "frequency dependent refraction by large scale irregularities can also modulate these diffractive quantities ( see e.g. bhat et al .",
    "some observers noted occasional periodic `` fringes '' in the dynamic spectrum which they quantified using a two - dimensional fourier analysis of the dynamic spectrum ( ewing et al . 1970 ; roberts & ables 1982 ; hewish , wolszczan , & graham 1985 ; cordes & wolszczan 1986 ; wolszczan & cordes 1987 ; and rickett , lyne & gupta 1997 ) .",
    "we now refer to the two - dimensional power spectrum of @xmath6 as the `` secondary '' spectrum of the scintillations .",
    "fringes in the dynamic spectrum appear as discrete features in the secondary spectrum and are typically explained as interference between two or more scattered images .",
    "recent observations of secondary spectra with much higher dynamic range have identified the dramatic `` parabolic arc '' phenomenon ( stinebring et al .",
    "2001 ; hereafter paper 1 ) .",
    "arcs appear as enhanced power ( at very low levels ) along parabolic curves extending out from the origin well beyond the normal diffractive feature . in this paper",
    ", we develop a theory that relates the secondary spectrum to the underlying scattered image of the pulsar .",
    "we find that the arc phenomenon is a generic feature of forward scattering and we identify conditions that enhance or diminish arcs .",
    "this paper contains an explanation for arcs referred to in paper 1 and also in a recent paper by walker et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who present a study of the arc phenomenon using approaches that complement ours . in ",
    "[ sec : obs ] we review the salient observed features of scintillation arcs .",
    "then in  [ sec : theory ] we introduce the general theory of secondary spectra through its relation to angular scattering and provide examples that lead to generalizations of the arc phenomenon . in ",
    "[ sec : ismcases ] we discuss cases relevant to the interpretation of observed phenomena . in  [ sec : scattphys ] we discuss the scattering physics and show examples of parabolic arcs from a full screen simulation of the scattering , and we end with discussion and conclusions in  [ sec : discuss ] .",
    "the continuum spectrum emitted by the pulsar is deeply modulated by interference associated with propagation through the irregular , ionized ism .",
    "propagation paths change with time owing to motions of the observer , medium and pulsar , causing the modulated spectrum to vary . the dynamic spectrum , @xmath6 , is the main observable quantity for our study .",
    "it is obtained by summing over the on - pulse portions of several to many pulse periods in a multi - channel spectrometer covering a total bandwidth up to @xmath7 mhz , for durations @xmath8 hr . we compute its two - dimensional power spectrum @xmath9 , the secondary spectrum , where the tilde indicates a two dimensional fourier transform and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are variables conjugate to @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively . the total receiver bandwidth and integration time define finite ranges for the transform .",
    "the dynamic spectrum shows randomly distributed diffractive maxima ( scintles ) in the frequency - time plane .",
    "examples are shown in figure  [ fig : dynsec_examples ] .",
    "in addition , organized patterns such as tilted scintles , periodic fringe patterns , and a loosely organized crisscross pattern have been observed and studied ( e.g. hewish , wolszczan , & graham 1985 ; cordes & wolszczan 1986 ) . in an analysis of four bright pulsars observed with high dynamic range at arecibo , we discovered that the crisscross pattern has a distinctive signature in the secondary spectrum ( paper  1 ) .",
    "faint , but clearly visible power extends away from the origin in a parabolic pattern or arc , the curvature of which depends on observing frequency and pulsar .",
    "the observational properties of these _ scintillation arcs _ are explored in more detail in hill ( 2003 ; hereafter paper  2 ) and stinebring ( in preparation , 2004 ; hereafter paper  3 ) . here",
    "we summarize the major properties of pulsar observations in order to provide a context for their theoretical explanation :    1 .   although scintillation arcs are faint , they are ubiquitous and persistent when the secondary spectrum has adequate dynamic range in the secondary spectrum is usually sufficient to show scintillation arcs .",
    "of 12 bright ( @xmath14  mjy ) pulsars that we have observed at arecibo , 10 display scintillation arcs , and the other two have features related to arcs . ] and high frequency and time resolution ( see figure  [ fig : dynsec_examples ] and paper  3 ) .",
    "the arcs often have a sharp outer edge , although in some cases ( e.g. figure  [ fig : dynsec_examples]c ) the parabola is a guide to a diffuse power distribution .",
    "there is usually power inside the parabolic arc ( figure  [ fig : dynsec_examples ] ) , but the power falls off rapidly outside the arc except in cases where the overall distribution is diffuse .",
    "3 .   the arc outlines are parabolic with minimal tilt or offset from the origin : @xmath15 .",
    "although symmetrical outlines are the norm , there are several examples of detectable shape asymmetries in our data .",
    "4 .   in contrast to the symmetrical shape typical of the arc outline , the power distribution of the secondary spectrum can be highly asymmetric in @xmath11 for a given @xmath10 and can show significant substructure .",
    "an example is shown in figure  [ fig:0834_multifreq ] .",
    "the timescale for change of this substructure is not well established , but some patterns and asymmetries have persisted for months .",
    "a particularly striking form of substructure consists of inverted _ arclets _ with the same value of @xmath16 and with apexes that lie along or inside the main arc outline ( figure  [ fig:0834_multifreq ] panels b and c ) .",
    "although a single scintillation arc is usually present for each pulsar , there is one case ( psr  b1133 + 16 ) in which multiple scintillation arcs , with different @xmath17 values , are seen ( figure  [ fig:1133_variety ] ) .",
    "at least two distinct @xmath17 values ( and , perhaps , as many as four ) are traceable over decades of time . 7 .",
    "arc curvature accurately follows a simple scaling law with observing frequency : @xmath18 ( paper  2 ) . in contemporaneous month - long observations over the range 0.4  2.2  ghz ,",
    "scintillation arcs were present at all frequencies if they were visible at any for a given pulsar , and the scintillation arc structure became sharper and better defined at high frequency .",
    "the arc curvature parameter @xmath17 is constant at the 510% level for @xmath19  years for the half dozen pulsars for which we have long - term data spans ( see paper  3 ) .    in this paper",
    "we explain or otherwise address all of these points as well as explore the dependence of arc features on properties of the scattering medium and source .",
    "though the parabolic arc phenomenon is striking and unexpected , it can be understood in terms of a simple model based on a `` thin screen '' of ionized gas containing fluctuations in electron density on a wide range of scales .",
    "incident radiation is scattered by the screen and then travels through free space to the observer , at whose location radiation has a distribution in angle of arrival .",
    "the intensity fluctuations are caused by interference between different components of the angular spectrum whose relative phases increase with distance from the screen .",
    "remarkably , we find that the arcs can be explained solely in terms of phase differences from geometrical path lengths",
    ". the phenomenon can equally well be described , using the fresnel - kirchoff diffraction integral , by spherical waves originating at a pair of points in the screen interfering at the observer having traveled along different geometric paths .",
    "thus , though the screen is dispersive , the arcs arise simply from diffraction and interference .",
    "dispersion and refraction in the screen will likely alter the shapes of the arcs , though we do not analyze these effects in this paper .    to get interference ,",
    "the screen must be illuminated by a radiation field of high spatial coherence , i.e. radiation from a point - like source .",
    "the source can be temporally incoherent because the different components of the temporal fourier transform each contribute nearly identical interference patterns , as in interferometry .",
    "two components of the angular spectrum arriving from directions @xmath20 and @xmath21 interfere to produce a two - dimensional fringe pattern whose phase varies slowly with observing frequency .",
    "the pattern is sampled in time and frequency as the observer moves through it , creating a sinusoidal fringe pattern in the dynamic spectrum .",
    "the fringe appears as a single fourier component in the secondary spectrum . under the small - angle scattering of the ism",
    "its @xmath10 coordinate is the differential geometric delay @xmath22 and its @xmath11 coordinate is the fringe rate @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is an appropriate transverse velocity ( see below ) . a quadratic relationship @xmath10 to @xmath11 results naturally from their quadratic and linear dependences on the angles .",
    "when one of the interfering waves is undeviated ( e.g. @xmath25 ) we immediately get the simple parabola @xmath26 . when the scattering is weak there will be a significant undeviated contribution resulting in a simple parabolic arc .",
    "however , we also find that an arc appears in strong scattering due to the interference of waves contained within the normal scattering disc with a faint halo of waves scattered at much larger angles .",
    "the faint halo exists only for scattering media having wavenumber spectra less steep than ( wavenumber)@xmath1 , including the kolmogorov spectrum .",
    "while the relation of @xmath10 to time delay is well known through the fourier relationship of the pulse broadening to the radio spectrum intensity scintillation , the physical interpretation of @xmath11 can be viewed in several ways besides the fringe rate .",
    "scintillation versus time is often fourier analyzed into a spectrum versus frequency ( @xmath11 ) in hz ; in turn this is simply related to spatial wavenumber @xmath27 and hence to angle of arrival ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "it can also be thought of as the beat frequency due to the different doppler shifts of the two scattered waves .",
    "thus the secondary spectrum can be considered as a differential _ delay - doppler spectrum , similar to that measured in radar applications . _      in this section we discuss the relationship between the scattered image and the secondary spectrum @xmath29 .",
    "later , in  [ sec : scattphys ] , we obtain the relation more rigorously by deriving @xmath29 as a fourth moment of the electric field .",
    "explicit results can be obtained in the limits of strong and weak scintillation , as shown in appendices [ sec : app - strong ] and [ sec : app - weak ] .",
    "we find that the weak scintillation result is simpler , being a second moment of the electric field since it only involves the interference of scattered waves with the unscattered field .",
    "however , pulsars are typically observed in strong scintillation , and the strong scintillation limit gives exactly the same result as in the approximate theory ( eq .",
    "[ eq : fpq1 ] ) used below .",
    "so we now apply the approximate theory to spherical waves from a pulsar scattered by a thin screen .",
    "consider the following geometry : a point source at @xmath30 , a thin screen at @xmath31 and an observer at @xmath32 .",
    "for convenience , we define @xmath33 .",
    "the screen changes only the phase of incident waves , but it can both diffract and refract radiation from the source . for a single frequency emitted from the source two components of the angular spectrum at angles @xmath20 , @xmath21 ( measured relative to the direct path ) sum and interfere at the observer s location with a phase difference @xmath34 .",
    "the resulting intensity is @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the intensities from each component ( e.g. cordes & wolszczan 1986 ) .",
    "the total phase difference @xmath38 , includes a contribution from geometrical path - length differences @xmath39 and from the screen phase , @xmath40 , which can include both small and large - scale structures that refract and diffract radiation .",
    "expanding @xmath34 to first order in time and frequency increments , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , the phase difference is = _ 0 + 2(f_t t + f _ ) , where @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 define the center of the observing window ; @xmath46 is the fringe rate or differential doppler shift , and @xmath47 is the differential group delay . in general @xmath48",
    "includes both a geometrical path - length difference and a dispersive term . at the end of  [",
    "sec : isconditions ] we consider the effects of dispersion , but in many cases of pulsar scintillation it can be shown that the dispersive term can be ignored .",
    "we proceed to retain only the geometric delays and obtain results ( appendix [ sec : appendixa ] ) that were reported in paper 1 : f _ & = & ( _ 2 ^ 2 - _ 1 ^ 2 ) [ eq : fnu ] + f_t & = & ( ) ( _ 2 - _ 1 ) .",

    "we examine how the form of the secondary spectrum varies with the form assumed for the scattered image , without considering the associated physical conditions in the medium .",
    "we postpone to  [ sec : scattphys ] a discussion of the scattering physics and the influence of the integration time .",
    "the integration time is important in determining whether the scattered brightness is a smooth function or is broken into speckles as discussed by narayan & goodman ( 1989 ) .",
    "this in turn influences whether the secondary spectrum takes a simple parabolic form or becomes fragmented .",
    "we analyze an arbitrary scattered image by treating its scattered brightness distribution , @xmath54 , as a probability density function ( pdf ) for the angles of scattering . in the continuous limit",

    "in  [ sec : theory ] we found two conditions that emphasize the arcs .",
    "the first is the interference between an undeviated wave and scattered waves , and the second is the enhancement of arcs when the waves are scattered preferentially parallel to the scintillation velocity .",
    "we now discuss how these conditions might occur .",
    "the basic arc , @xmath82 , is formed by interference of a core of undeviated or weakly deviated waves with widely scattered waves .",
    "there are two circumstances where a significant fraction of the total flux density can come from near @xmath152 .",
    "one is in strong scintillation , when the `` central core '' of the scattered brightness interferes with a wider low level halo , as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : powerlaw - sfn ] for a kolmogorov density spectrum and other power - law forms with @xmath124 and neglible inner scale . in this case",
    "the core of the scattered brightness is not a point source , merely much more compact than the far - out halo radiation .",
    "thus the arc is a smeared version of the form in eq .",
    "[ eq : fpqu ] , which has no power outside the basic arcline .",
    "examples were shown in figures [ fig : powfpqset ] and [ fig : kolfpqset ] .",
    "the other case is when the scattering strength is low enough that a fraction of the flux density is not broadened significantly in angle .",
    "the requirements on such an `` unscattered core '' are simply that the differential delay over the core must not exceed , say , a quarter of the wave period .",
    "then the core is simply that portion of the brightness distribution in the first fresnel zone , @xmath153 , and the electric - field components in the core sum coherently .",
    "thus the core component can be significant even if the overall scattered brightness function is much wider than the first fresnel zone .",
    "the relative strength of the core to the remainder of the brightness distribution can be defined in term of the `` strength of scintillation '' .",
    "we define this as @xmath154 , the normalized rms intensity ( scintillation index ) under the born approximation .",
    "it can be written in terms of the wave structure function @xmath155 , as @xmath156 with a simple kolmogorov spectrum , where @xmath157 , @xmath114 is the field coherence scale and @xmath158 and @xmath159 . here",
    "@xmath160 defines the scattering angle .",
    "this gives @xmath161 ; thus it is also related to the fractional diffractive bandwidth @xmath162 .",
    "note that a distinction should be made between strength of _ scattering _ and strength of _",
    "scintillation_. for radio frequencies in the ism we always expect that the overall rms phase perturbations will be very large compared to one radian , albeit over relatively large scales , which corresponds to strong _ scattering_. in contrast strong _ scintillation _ corresponds to a change in phase of more than one radian across a fresnel scale .",
    "c +    in weak scintillation ( but strong scattering ) the fraction of the flux density in the core is @xmath163 .",
    "figure [ fig : simkoliso ] ( top panels ) shows a simulation with @xmath164 , in which @xmath75 drops steeply outside the arc @xmath82 .",
    "the analysis of appendix [ sec : app - weak ] shows that in weak scintillation @xmath75 should be analyzed as a function of wavelength rather than frequency because the arcs are more clearly delineated when the simulations are fourier analyzed versus wavelength .",
    "we have also simulated weak scintillation in a nondispersive phase screen and find similar arcs . in strong scintillation there is a small fractional range of frequencies and",
    "the distinction between wavelength and frequency becomes unimportant .",
    "figure [ fig : simkoliso ] shows that the secondary spectrum in weak scintillation has a particularly well defined arc defined by a sharp outer edge .",
    "this is because it is dominated by the interference between scattered waves and the unscattered core , as described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : fpqg1 ] ) with a point component at the origin .",
    "we can ignore the mutual interference between scattered waves since they are much weaker than the core .",
    "the result is that the secondary spectrum is analogous to a hologram in which the unscattered core serves as the reference beam .",
    "the secondary spectrum can be inverted to recover the scattered brightness function using eq .",
    "( [ eq : fpqg1 ] ) , which is the analog of viewing a holographic image .",
    "the inversion , however , is not complete in that there is an ambiguity in the equation between positive and negative values of @xmath165 .",
    "nevertheless , the technique opens the prospect of mapping a two - dimensional scattered image from observations with a single dish at a resolution of milliarcseconds .",
    "as the scintillation strength increases the core becomes less prominent , and the parabolic arc loses contrast .",
    "however , we can detect arcs at very low levels and they are readily seen at large values of @xmath166 .",
    "medium strong scintillation is shown in figure [ fig : simkoliso ] ( bottom panels ) , which is a simulation of a screen with an isotropic kolmogorov spectrum with @xmath167 for which @xmath168 .",
    "the results compare well with both the ensemble average , strong scintillation computations for a kolmogorov screen in  [ sec : ismcases ] and with several of the observations shown in figure [ fig : dynsec_examples ] .",
    "we note that several of the observations in  [ sec : obs ] show sharp - edged and symmetric parabolic arcs , which appear to be more common for low or intermediate strength of scintillation ( as characterized by the apparent fractional diffractive bandwidth ) .",
    "this fits with our postulate that the arcs become sharper as the strength of scintillation decreases . in weak scintillation",
    "the born approximation applies , in which case two or more arcs can be caused by two or more screens separated along the line of sight .",
    "we have confirmed this by simulating waves passing through several screens , each of which yields a separate arc with curvature as expected for an unscattered wave incident on each screen .",
    "this is presumably the explanation for the multiple arcs seen in figure  [ fig:1133_variety ] for pulsar b1133 + 16 .    in terms of normalized variables @xmath64 the half - power widths of @xmath75 are approximately unity in strong scattering and yet we can see the arcs out to @xmath169 . as we noted earlier",
    "this corresponds to scattering angles well above the diffractive angle @xmath56 , and so probes scales much smaller than those probed by normal analysis of diffractive iss .",
    "our simulations confirm that with an inner scale in the density spectrum having a wavenumber cutoff @xmath170 , the arc will be reduced beyond where @xmath171 .",
    "however , to detect such a cut - off observationally requires very high sensitivity and a large dynamic range in the secondary spectrum .",
    "the enhancement in arc contrast when the scattering is extended along the direction of the effective velocity was discussed in ",
    "[ sec : theory ] .",
    "the enhancement is confirmed by comparing the @xmath167 simulations in figures  [ fig : simkoliso ] and [ fig : simkolaniso ] .",
    "c +    in the anisotropic case the arc consists of finely - spaced parallel arcs which are in turn crossed by reverse arclets , somewhat reminiscent of the observations .",
    "the discussion of  [ sec : pt+ext ] suggests that these are caused by the mutual interference of substructure in the angular spectrum @xmath54 .",
    "the question is , what causes the substructure ?",
    "one possibility is that it is stochastic speckle - like substructure in the image of a scatter - broadened source .",
    "alternatively , there could be discrete features in @xmath54 , ( `` multiple images '' ) caused by particular structures in the ism phase .    in our simulations ,",
    "the screen is stochastic with a kolmogorov spectrum and so it should have speckle but no deterministic multiple images .",
    "the diffractive scale , @xmath114 , is approximately the size of a stationary phase point on the screen and , also , approximately the size of a constructive maximum at the observer plane .",
    "there are , thus , @xmath172 across the 2d scattering disk that contribute to an individual point at the observer plane .",
    "this large number of speckles ( @xmath173 in these simulations ) has the effect of averaging out details in the secondary spectrum , particularly in the isotropic scattering case .",
    "the effect of anisotropy in the coherence scale is to broaden the image along one axis with respect to the other .",
    "an image elongated by a ratio of @xmath174 would have @xmath175 speckes in the @xmath68-direction but only @xmath176 in the @xmath177-direction .",
    "in short , the image would break into a line of many elliptical speckles ( elongated in @xmath177 ) distributed predominantly along @xmath68 . in comparing the anisotropic and isotropic simulations ( upper figure [ fig : simkolaniso ] and lower figure [ fig : simkoliso ] )",
    ", it appears that the arclets are more visible under anisotropy .",
    "we suggest that the changed substructure in the image is responsible .",
    "substructure may consist of short - lived speckles or longer - lived multiple subimages whose relative contributions depend on the properties of the scattering medium . in the simulations the arclets appear to be independent from one realization to the next , as expected for a speckle phenomenon .",
    "however , in some of the observations arclets persist for as long as a month ( see  [ sec : obs ] ) and exhibit a higher contrast than in the simulation .",
    "these require long - lived multiple images in the angular spectrum and so imply quasi - deterministic structures in the ism plasma .    in summary",
    "we conclude that the occasional isolated arclets ( as in figure [ fig:0834_multifreq ] ) must be caused by fine _ substructure in @xmath54 . whereas some of these may be stochastic as in the speckles of a scattered image",
    ", the long lived arclets require the existence of discrete features in the angular spectrum , which can not be part of a kolmogorov spectrum . these might be more evidence for discrete structures in the medium at scales @xmath178  au , that have been invoked to explain fringing episodes ( e.g. hewish , wolszczan & graham 1985 ; cordes & wolszczan 1986 ; wolszczan & cordes 1987 ; rickett , lyne & gupta 1997 ) and , possibly , extreme scattering events ( eses ) ( fiedler 1987 ; romani , blandford & cordes 1987 ) in quasar light curves .",
    "_      as summarized in ",
    "[ sec : obs ] the observed arcs are sometimes asymmetric as well as exhibiting reverse arclets ( e.g. figure [ fig:0834_multifreq ] ) .",
    "a scattered brightness that is asymmetric in @xmath179 can cause @xmath75 to become asymmetric in @xmath72 .",
    "we do not expect a true ensemble average brightness to be asymmetric , but the existence of large scale gradients in phase will refractively shift the seeing image , with the frequency dependence of a plasma .",
    "simulations can be used to study refractive effects , as in figure [ fig : simkolaniso ] ( bottom panels ) , which shows @xmath75 for a screen with an isotropic kolmogorov spectrum and a linear phase gradient .",
    "the phase gradient causes sloping features in the primary dynamic spectrum and asymmetry in the secondary spctrum .",
    "the apex of the parabolic arc is shifted to negative @xmath72 value and becomes brighter for positive @xmath72 .",
    "thus we suggest refraction as the explanation of the occasional asymmetry observed in the arcs .",
    "relatively large phase gradients are needed to give as much asymmetry as is sometimes observed .",
    "for example , a gradient of 2 radians per @xmath114 , which shifts the scattering disc by about its diameter , was included in the simulation of figure [ fig : simkolaniso ] to exemplify image wandering . in a stationary random medium with a kolmogorov spectrum",
    ", such large shifts can occur depending on the outer scale , but they should vary only over times long compared with the refractive scintillation timescale . this is a prediction that can be tested .    in considering the fringe frequencies in appendix [ sec : appendixa ]",
    "we only included the geometric contribution to the net phase and excluded the plasma term .",
    "we have redone the analysis to include a plasma term with a large scale gradient and curvature in the screen phase added to the small scale variations which cause diffractive scattering .",
    "we do not give the details here and present only the result and a summary of the issues involved .",
    "we analyzed the case where there are large scale phase terms following the plasma dispersion law , that shift and stretch the unscattered ray , as in the analysis of cordes , pidwerbetsky and lovelace ( 1986 ) . in the absence of diffractive scattering",
    "these refractive terms create a shifted stationary phase point ( i.e. ray center ) at @xmath180 and a weak modulation in amplitude due to focusing or defocusing over an elliptical region . with the diffractive scattering",
    "also included we find that the fringe frequency @xmath72 is unaffected by refraction but the delay @xmath71 becomes : p & = & ( _ 2 + ) ^2 - ( _ 1 + ) ^2 + & - & , where @xmath181 is a @xmath182 matrix that describes the quadratic dependence of the refracting phase from the image center . a related question is whether the shift in image position due to a phase gradient also shifts the position of minimum delay , in the fashion one might expect from fermat s principle that a ray path is one of minimum delay .",
    "however , since fermat s minimum delay is a phase delay and our variable @xmath10 or @xmath71 is a group delay , its minimum position is shifted in the opposite direction by a plasma phase gradient .",
    "this is shown by the first two terms , i.e.  @xmath183 which goes to zero at @xmath184 .",
    "however , we do not pursue this result here , since the formulation of  [ sec : theory ] does not include the frequency dependence of the scattered brightness function , which would be required for a full analysis of the frequency dependence of the plasma scattering .",
    "it is thus a topic for future theoretical study , but meanwhile the simulations provide the insight that indeed plasma refraction can cause pronounced asymmetry in the arcs .      like other scintillation phenomena",
    ", arcs will be suppressed if the source is extended . in particular , the lengths of arcs depend on the transverse spatial extent over which the scattering screen is illuminated by coherent radiation from the source . for a source of finite angular size @xmath185 as viewed at the screen , the incident wave field is spatially incoherent on scales larger than @xmath186 . an arc measured at a particular fringe rate ( @xmath11 ) represents the interference fringes of waves separated by a baseline @xmath187 at the screen , corresponding to a fringe rate @xmath188 . the fringes are visible only if the wave field is coherent over @xmath189 and are otherwise suppressed .",

    "[ eq : ft - sou ] indicates that longer arcs are expected for more compact sources , larger effective velocities , and scattering screens nearer to the observer .",
    "equivalently , using @xmath193 , the arc length can be measured along the @xmath10 axis with a corresponding cut - off , f_= ( ) ^2 , [ eq : fnu - sou ] where @xmath194^{-1/2}$ ] is the effective fresnel angle .",
    "it is useful to measure the arc s extent in @xmath11 in terms of the characteristic diss time scale , @xmath195 and to relate the characteristic diffraction scale @xmath114 to the isoplanatic angular scale , @xmath196 .",

    "the theoretical analysis under weak scintillation conditions is given in appendix d.2 , where it is seen that the squared visibility function provides a cut - off to the point - source secondary spectrum @xmath29 .",
    "a remarkable result from this analysis is that measurements of @xmath29 of an extended source can be used , in principle , to estimate the squared visibility function of the source in two dimensions  if the underlying secondary spectrum , @xmath29 , for a point source is already known .",
    "the effects of an extended source can also be analyzed in asymptotic strong scintillation .",
    "this requires the same type of analysis as for the frequency decorrelation in scintillation of an extended source .",

    "they essentially measured the phase of the `` cross secondary spectrum '' between the iss at different longitudes , at a particular @xmath53 .",
    "clearly one could extend this to study the phase along an arc in @xmath53 .",
    "such studies require high signal - to - noise ratio data with time and frequency samplings that resolve scintillations in dynamic spectra , which can be obtained on a few pulsars with the arecibo and green bank telescopes .",

    "iss has been seen in quasars and active galactic nuclei ( sometimes referred to as intraday variations ) , but few observations have had sufficient frequency coverage to consider the dynamic spectrum and test for arcs . however , spectral observations have been reported for the quasars j1819 + 385 ( de bruyn and macquart , in preparation ) and b0405 - 385 ( kedziora chudczer et al . , in preparation ) . a preliminary analysis of the data from j1819 + 385 by rickett et al .",
    "( in preparation ) showed no detectable arc , from which they set a lower limit on the source size .",
    "new observations over a wide well - sampled range of frequencies will allow better use of this technique .",
    "it is evident that we have only begun to explain the detailed structures in the parabolic arcs observed in pulsar scintillation .",
    "however , it is also clear that the basic phenomenon can be understood from a remarkably simple model of small angle scattering from a thin phase - changing screen , and does not depend on the dispersive nature of the refractive index in the screen .",
    "interference fringes between pairs of scattered waves lie at the heart of the phenomenon .",
    "the @xmath10 coordinate of the secondary spectrum is readily interpreted as the differential group delay between the two interfering waves , and the coordinate @xmath11 is interpreted as their fringe rate or , equivalently , the differential doppler frequency , which is proportional to the difference in angles of scattering projected along the direction of the scintillation velocity .",
    "we have developed the theory by modeling the interference for an arbitrary angular distribution of scattering .",
    "we have given the ensemble average secondary spectrum in asymptotic strong and weak scintillation , and we have used a full phase screen simulation to test the results under weak and intermediate strength of scintillation .",
    "the results are mutually consistent .",
    "a simple parabolic arc with apex at the origin of the @xmath53 plane arises most simply in weak scintillation as the interference between a scattered and an `` unscattered '' wave .",
    "the secondary spectrum is then of second order in the scattered field and maps to the two - dimensional wavenumber spectrum of the screen phase , though with an ambiguity in the sign of the wavenumber perpendicular to the velocity .",
    "remarkably , this gives a way to estimate two - dimensional structure in the scattering medium from observations at a single antenna , in a fashion that is analogous to holographic reconstruction .",
    "in strong scattering the parabolic arcs become less distinct since the interference between two scattered waves has to be summed over all possible angles of scattering , making it a fourth order quantity in the scattered field .",
    "nevertheless , the arc remains visible when the scattered brightenss has a compact core and a `` halo '' of low level scattering at relatively large angles .",
    "media with shallow power - law wavenumber spectra ( including the kolmogorov spectrum ) have such extended halos , and the detection of arcs provides a powerful probe of structures ten or more times smaller than those probed by normal interstellar scintillation and can thus be used to test for an inner scale cut - off in the interstellar density spectrum .",
    "the prominence of arcs depends on the isotropy of the scattering medium as well as on the slope and inner scale of its wavenumber spectrum .",
    "arcs become more prominent when the scattering is anisotropic and enhanced preferentially along the scintillation velocity . however , in simulations , prominent arcs are seen over quite a wide range of angles about this orientation .",
    "scattering that is enhanced parallel to the scintillation velocity corresponds to _ spatial structures that are elongated transverse to the velocity vector .",
    "thus the common detection of arcs may provide evidence for anisotropy in the interstellar plasma , and with careful modeling observations should yield estimates for the associated axial ratios .",
    "_    there are several details of the observed arcs for which we have only tentative explanations .",
    "we can understand the existence of discrete reverse arcs as due to discrete peaks in the scattered brightness interfering with an extended halo .",
    "such isolated peaks are to be expected in short term integrations due to speckle in the scattered image .",
    "however , observations with only a few isolated reverse arcs  and , particularly , arclets that persist for days to weeks  imply only a few discrete peaks in the scattered image , while normal speckle is expected to give multiple bright points with a much higher filling factor .",
    "this is a topic for further investigation .",
    "another observational detail is that on some occasions the arc power distribution is highly asymmetrical in fringe frequency .",
