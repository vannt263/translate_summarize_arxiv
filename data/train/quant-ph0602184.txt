    "the reduced dynamics of a quantum system in contact with a reservoir is generally described in terms of a master equation .",
    "according to a widely accepted lore , the physical and mathematical assumptions that are required in order to derive such an equation are of two types : the reservoir is much larger than the system ( in a sense that can be made mathematically precise ) and the coupling between them is very weak . in these limits ,",
    "the system has a negligible influence on the reservoir and the global properties of the latter remain unaffected during the evolution . in turns , this enables one to assume that the reservoir is in an equilibrium state ( which can be properly defined by virtue of its macroscopic features  the large number of degrees of freedom ) .",
    "one should notice that a physically clear - cut distinction between a `` large '' reservoir and one of its subsystems can only be made because of their ( small ) mutual coupling . in this respect ,",
    "the two above - mentioned hypotheses are not only consistent , but also logically intertwined .",
    "excellent introductions to this subject can be found in refs.@xcite .",
    "there is , however , another important requirement that is necessary in the derivation of the master equation , but that is often taken for granted : a factorized form of initial conditions is used to define the dynamics .",
    "this is a hypothesis of initial statistical independence that is certainly less easily justified .",
    "the objective of this article is to investigate the evolution of the system with _ correlated _ initial conditions .",
    "we shall see that in such a case nakajima ",
    "zwanzig s projection method @xcite requires an interesting refinement and a characterization of the reference state of the reservoir .",
    "several authors have addressed the question of the modifications that arise when it is not permissible to assume initially independent system - environment @xcite .",
    "in such a case , the features of the reduced dynamics have interesting spin - offs in relation to other issues , such as the ( complete ) positivity of the evolution @xcite .",

    "a more rigorous investigation will be presented elsewhere .    since some of the issues discussed in this article might not be familiar to every physicist , in particular because of the mathematical background required to study nonequilibrium statistical mechanics , we added some detailed explanations , translating some more advanced mathematical concepts into rather simple physical examples .",

    "however , we have in mind more general instances , such as nonequilibrium steady states @xcite .",
    "the main target of the present article is the reconsideration of the assumption of the factorized initial condition ( [ eqn : rhoprod ] ) .",
    "the system state @xmath31 at time @xmath21 is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the partial trace over the reservoir degrees of freedom , a linear operator from @xmath34 , the banach space of trace - class operators on the total hilbert space @xmath0 , onto @xmath35 .",

    "since we are interested in a _ correlated _ initial state @xmath22 , which is not factorized like ( [ eqn : rhoprod ] ) , a question arises as to which state should be taken as the reference state @xmath48 @xcite and whether the naive choice @xmath49 is in principle appropriate .",
    "we shall see that the situation is much more subtle than one might naively expect : the reference state @xmath48 and the reservoir dynamics can not be independent , but must satisfy some important properties in order to yield a consistent description of the physical dynamics .",
    "one of the main subjects of this article will be the specification of the correct state @xmath48 .",
    "furthermore , our analysis will show that attention should be paid to the reference state @xmath48 _ even for a factorized initial state_. this corroborates and sheds additional light on the rigorous conditions for the derivation of the master equation @xcite . at this moment , we take for granted only the stationarity ( [ batheq ] ) of @xmath48 with respect to the reservoir free dynamics , namely @xmath50 .",
    "let us project the liouville equation ( [ eqn : a1 ] ) onto the two subspaces defined by @xmath45 and @xmath51 .",
    "notice first that @xmath52 = [ \\mathcal{q},\\mathcal{l}_\\mathrm{s}]=0,\\quad \\mathcal{p}\\mathcal{l}_\\mathrm{b } = \\mathcal{l}_\\mathrm{b } \\mathcal{p}=0,\\quad [ \\mathcal{q},\\mathcal{l}_\\mathrm{b}]=0 .",

    "the state of system s evolves according to the master equation ( [ eqn : diffeq ] ) , while reservoir b remains in the state @xmath48 .",
    "these statements are proved under the following assumptions :    1 .",
    "[ spectrum ] @xmath27 is a simple eigenvalue of the reservoir liouvillian @xmath8 corresponding to the eigenvector @xmath48 and the remaining part of the spectrum of @xmath8 is absolutely continuous @xcite ( strictly speaking , for infinitely extended reservoir , the spectrum of @xmath8 can be properly defined only once the sector has been specified : in our case , the relevant sector is that containing the state @xmath48 ) ; 2 .",
    "the initial ( correlated ) state of the total system is given in the form @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a bounded superoperator ( i.e. , @xmath68 s are bounded operators ) satisfying the normalization condition @xmath69 .",
    "in other words , the initial state @xmath22 is a bounded perturbation of the state @xmath70 ( and belongs to the sector specified by it ) .",
    "several comments are in order .",
    "first , observe that the liouvillian of an infinitely extended system can bear a point spectrum , as in hypothesis ( i ) ( see for instance proposition 4.3.36 of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "second , the spectral properties required in hypothesis ( i ) imply that @xmath48 is _ mixing _ with respect to the reservoir dynamics @xmath71 @xcite , i.e. , @xmath72 for any bounded ( super)operators @xmath73 and @xmath74 of the reservoir , where @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",

    "both situations are within the scope of our analysis .     and the chemical potential @xmath77 ; ( b ) system s in interaction with a reservoir b made up of two subreservoirs at different temperatures @xmath78 and @xmath79 and chemical potentials @xmath77 and @xmath80 , with a steady current flowing between them ( ness ) . in both cases",
    ", @xmath5 is the coupling constant : a proper application of van hove s `` @xmath81 '' rescaling in the derivation of the master equation for s requires that the reference state of reservoir b be mixing . ]",
    "third , hypothesis ( i ) can be relaxed .",
    "in fact , the proof will make use only of the mixing property ( [ eqn : mixingb ] ) .",
    "therefore , the remaining part of the spectrum can contain a singular continuous part : one must simply make sure that the continuous spectrum is transient ( a property automatically verified by the absolutely continuous part , due to riemann ",
    "lebesgue s lemma ) .",
    "fourth , the correlation between system s and reservoir b is more transparent if the initial state @xmath22 in ( [ eqn : condinitialstate ] ) is written as @xmath82 where @xmath83 the last term @xmath84 represents the correlation between system s and reservoir b. the important point is that each term is a bounded perturbation of the state @xmath70 and thus belongs to the single sector specified by it ( see appendix [ app : inequivsec ] for a clarification and a tutorial discussion of this issue ) . indeed , the factorized part of the initial density matrix can be written as    @xmath85    where @xmath86 is any complete orthonormal basis of system s. clearly , @xmath84 is self - adjoint , but it is not necessarily positive - definite .",
    "fifth , the states of the type ( [ eqn : condinitialstate ] ) belong to a very general class : basically , if one deals with separable hilbert spaces , ( [ eqn : condinitialstate ] ) is of the kraus form and therefore represents a completely positive map ( that connects any two density matrices ) . for quantum mechanical systems",
    "( with discrete spectra ) , ( [ eqn : condinitialstate ] ) covers all the possible states . in more general cases",

    "iii.2 and iii.3 of ref .",
    "in such a case , any normal states with respect to @xmath87 can be written as ( [ eqn : condinitialstate ] ) with arbitrary precision .",
    "( see also the arguments in ref .  @xcite . )    finally , the projection @xmath45 in ( [ eqn : defproj ] ) must be defined in terms of @xmath48 , which is mixing and `` contained '' in the initial state @xmath22 in the sense of ( [ eqn : condinitialstate ] ) .",
    "this is the _ criterion _ for a _",
    "consistent choice _ of the reference state @xmath48 .",
    "we will see in the next section that nakajima ",
    "zwanzig s projection @xmath45 with the correct reference state @xmath48 is nothing but the eigenprojection of the liouvillian @xmath8 belonging to the simple eigenvalue @xmath27 , as suggested by ( [ eqn : proppq ] ) .",
    "note further that a state @xmath22 that refers [ in the sense of ( [ eqn : condinitialstate ] ) ] to a coherent superposition of two ( or more ) different mixing states of an infinite reservoir can not be a physical state , since it is the superposition of states belonging to different inequivalent sectors .",
    "( imagine , for example , the superposition of states with different temperatures . )",
    "hypothesis ( ii ) is therefore reasonable from this point of view and the states @xmath22 of the form ( [ eqn : condinitialstate ] ) cover diverse physically interesting states , ranging from canonical equilibrium states to ness , as far as their @xmath48 s are mixing .",
    "before we prove the theorem , let us observe that the projection @xmath45 with the correct reference state @xmath48 is nothing but the eigenprojection belonging to the simple eigenvalue @xmath27 of the reservoir liouvillian @xmath8 . to this end",
    ", we first show how the eigenprojection of @xmath27 acts on a state of the total system .    hypothesis ( i )",
    "states that for any reservoir state @xmath24 in question the spectral resolution of @xmath88 reads @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the spectral projections of @xmath8 belonging to its simple eigenvalue @xmath27 and to its absolutely continuous spectrum @xmath92 , respectively .",
    "in particular , @xmath93 by riemann - lebesgue s lemma , one gets from ( [ eq : specrestxt ] ) @xmath94 in a weak sense .",
    "the last equality follows from the condition that @xmath48 is the eigenstate belonging to the simple eigenvalue 0 .    as anticipated in the previous section ,",
    "the requirement of an absolutely continuous spectrum is not really necessary to prove ( [ eq : rl ] ) .",
    "one needs only the mixing property ( [ eqn : mixingb ] ) .",
    "indeed , let us consider a state of the total system belonging to the same sector of @xmath95 , i.e.  a state @xmath96 of the kind ( [ eqn : condinitialstate ] ) .",
    "for any operator @xmath97 , where @xmath98 s are operators of system s and @xmath99 s bounded operators of reservoir b , the mixing property ( [ eqn : mixingb ] ) of @xmath48 yields @xmath100\\nonumber\\\\ & { \\xrightarrow{t\\to\\infty } } & \\sum_i{\\mathop{\\mathrm{tr}}\\nolimits}_\\mathrm{b}\\{x_i\\omega_\\mathrm{b}\\}{\\mathop{\\mathrm{tr}}\\nolimits}\\ { a_i\\lambda({1}_\\mathrm{s}\\otimes\\omega_\\mathrm{b } ) \\ } \\nonumber\\\\ & = & { \\mathop{\\mathrm{tr}}\\nolimits}[d({\\mathop{\\mathrm{tr}}\\nolimits}_\\mathrm{b}\\{\\rho\\}\\otimes\\omega_\\mathrm{b } ) ] , \\label{eqn : diagonalprojectionb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and in this sense , we have @xmath101 for any state @xmath96 of the form ( [ eqn : condinitialstate ] ) . by comparing ( [ eq : rl ] ) and ( [ eqn : bathrelaxation ] )",
    ", it is clear that the eigenprojection @xmath90 of the liouvillian @xmath8 belonging to the eigenvalue @xmath27 acts on the total system as @xmath102 we have thus proved that ( [ eqn : pi0a ] ) holds even when the spectrum @xmath92 in ( [ eq : specrestxt ] ) contains a singular continuous part , provided that the latter be transient , i.e. , riemann  lebesgue s lemma hold also for it .",
    "furthermore , it is interesting to observe that the eigenprojection @xmath103 is nothing but the `` diagonal projection , '' that extracts the diagonal part ( with respect to the reservoir degrees of freedom ) of a density operator . to discuss the diagonal components of a reservoir with a continuous spectrum ,",
    "consider a large parameter @xmath104 , corresponding to the volume , so that the hamiltonian @xmath105 admits a discrete spectrum @xmath106 , i.e. , @xmath107 with @xmath108 for @xmath109 .",
    "then , it is easy to define the diagonal part ( with respect to the reservoir degrees of freedom ) of a density matrix of the total system , @xmath110 , @xmath111 since @xmath112 s are discrete , one easily sees that @xmath113 and thus , @xmath114 we now define the diagonal part of @xmath96 via @xmath115 assuming that the two limits can be interchanged .",
    "then , under the assumption of the ergodicity of @xmath48 [ which follows from the mixing of @xmath48 : see eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ergodicitya ] ) ] , one has , for any state @xmath96 of the type ( [ eqn : condinitialstate ] ) , @xmath116 which is the right - hand side of ( [ eqn : pi0a ] ) .",

    "is given in appendix [ app : diagonalprojection ] .",
    "it is now clear that the eigenprojection @xmath103 in ( [ eqn : pi0a ] ) acts like the projection @xmath45 defined in ( [ eqn : defproj ] ) , provided the state @xmath20 is of the form @xmath119 , with a bounded superoperator @xmath120 . since @xmath20 has evolved from the initial state ( [ eqn : condinitialstate ] )",
