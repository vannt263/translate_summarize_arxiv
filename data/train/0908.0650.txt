    "a flaring activity during the afterglow ( ag ) phase of a gamma ray burst ( grb ) was first observed in the late - time ag of grb 970508 with the narrow field instrument ( nfi ) aboard the bepposax satellite in the x - ray band @xcite , and with ground based telescopes in the optical band @xcite .",
    "it was interpreted in the framework of the fireball ( fb ) model of grbs as a delayed burst from the central grb engine @xcite .",
    "alternatively , in the cannonball ( cb ) model of grbs it was interpreted as a synchrotron radiation ( sr ) flare from an encounter of the highly relativistic jetted ejecta from an underlying supernova ( sn ) explosion with a density jump in the interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "late - time flares were later discovered in the broadband ag of several other grbs that were localized by the bepposax satellite , most notably in grb 000301c at @xmath0 days after burst @xcite where the flare was attributed to gravitational microlensing @xcite and in grb 030329 @xcite where the flare was interpreted in the framework of the fb model as due to ` refreshed shocks ' generated by a late activity of the central engine @xcite . in the cb model , however , these flares were well reproduced by the emission of sr from encounters of the jetted ejecta from an underlying sn explosion in a star formation region with density jumps within or at the border of a super bubble created by the star formation region @xcite .",
    "early - time x - ray flares ending the prompt emission phase were also detected by the wide field camera ( wfc ) aboard bepposax in a few grbs such as grb 011121 . in the fb model",
    "they were attributed to the onset of the external shock in the circumburst material . in the cb model",
    "they were interpreted as being due to the last episodes of bipolar cb ejections from a shutting off central engine . shortly after the launch of the swift satellite in november 2004 , data collected with its x - ray telescope ( xrt ) showed that x - ray flares are quite common in all the phases of the emission from grbs . in more than 50% of",
    "the grbs observed with the swift x - ray telescope ( xrt ) , flares were observed at the end of the prompt emission and/or the early ag phase @xcite . in some cases",
    "x - ray flares were observed also at very late times , of the order of several days after the prompt emission .",
    "although the information on flares is much more sketchy compared to that on the prompt gamma ray pulses , their spectral and temporal behaviours show clearly that the x - ray flares during the prompt @xmath1-ray emission follow the pattern of the @xmath1-ray pulses , suggesting they are the low energy part of these pulses .",
    "the x - ray flares ending the prompt emission and those superimposed on the early - time afterglow have a fast spectral evolution .",
    "their peak intensities decrease with time , and their spectral and temporal behaviours are similar to those of the prompt x/@xmath1-ray pulses , except that they are progressively softer and last longer . in most cases",
    "their @xmath1-ray emission probably is below the detection sensitivity of the swift broad alert telescope ( bat ) . in some cases their fluence in the xrt band",
    "exceeded that of the prompt emission in the bat 15 - 150 kev band @xcite .",
    "late - time ( @xmath2 s ) x - ray flares , however , seem to exhibit temporal and spectral behaviours that are different from those of most of the early - time flares .",
    "their power - law decline is more moderate , they are `` achromatic '' with a power - law spectrum almost identical to that of the late - time ag , and they show very little spectral evolution ( see , e.g. , the late time broad band flares in grbs 060614 @xcite and 081028 @xcite , and the hardness ratio during late time flares in swift grbs reported in the swift - xrt lightcurve repository , @xcite ) .",
    "flares in the x - ray lightcurve of swift grbs were studied phenomenologically by various observer groups @xcite .",
    "modifications of previously suggested models and new theoretical models were proposed and discussed by several authors @xcite , but none of these proposed models was shown to actually derive the observed lightcurves and spectral evolution of either early - time or late - time flares from underlying physical assumptions .",
    "flares are a natural consequence of the cannonball ( cb ) model of grbs , which was motivated by a grb - microquasar analogy @xcite . in the cb model , _ long - duration _ grbs and their ags are produced by bipolar jets of highly relativistic plasmoids of ordinary matter ejected in accretion episodes on the newly formed compact stellar object @xcite in core - collapse supernova ( sn ) explosions @xcite .",
    "it is hypothesized that an accretion disk or a torus is produced around the newly formed compact object , either by stellar material originally close to the surface of the imploding core and left behind by the explosion - generating outgoing shock , or by more distant stellar matter falling back after its passage @xcite . as observed in microquasars @xcite , each time part of the accretion disk falls abruptly onto the compact object , two jets of cannonballs ( cbs ) made of _ ordinary - matter plasma _ are emitted with large bulk - motion lorentz factors in opposite directions along the rotation axis , wherefrom matter has already fallen back onto the compact object due to lack of rotational support . the entire radiation emitted from a grb",
    "is produced by the interaction of the jet of cbs with the environmemt along its path , as illustrated in fig .",
    "the prompt @xmath1-ray and x - ray emission is dominated by inverse compton scattering ( ics ) of photons of the sn light filling the cavity produced by the pre - supernova wind / ejecta blown from the progenitor star long before the grb .",
    "the cbs electrons compton up - scatter this ` glory ' light into a narrow conical beam of @xmath1 rays along the cbs direction of motion .",
    "each cb produces a single grb pulse .",
    "an x - ray ` flare ' coincident in time with a prompt @xmath1-ray pulse is simply its low - energy part .",
    "the natural explanation of flares ending the prompt emission and during the early time afterglow is the same : ics of glory photons by the electrons of cbs ejected in late accretion episodes of fall - back matter on the newly formed central object .",
    "early - time x - ray flares without an accompanying detectable @xmath1-ray emission are usually ic flares ( icfs ) produced by cbs with relatively smaller lorentz factors , due to weakening activity of the engine : as the accretion material is consumed , one may expect the ` engine ' to have a few progressively - weakening dying pangs . like the lightcurves of the prompt grb pulses , the lightcurves of icfs exhibit a rapid softening during their fast decline phase ( see , e.g. , the xrt hardness ratio reported for swift grbs in the swift lightcurve repository , @xcite ) .    in the cb model ,",
    "each ic flare ( icf ) is followed by the emission of sr flare ( srf ) from the encounter of the cb with the wind / ejecta , which was blown from the progenitor star long before the grb ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "because of time - aberration in the observer frame , these srfs appear to have only short lag - times relative to the corresponding icfs .",
    "below their peak energy , the spectral behaviour of the ics pulses / flares is roughly @xmath3 , while the sr emission from fast cooling electrons has typically @xmath4 .",
    "thus , while the prompt kev - mev pulses / flares are dominated by ics of glory light , the ` prompt ' optical emission is dominated by sr . as the glory extends into the wind ,",
    "often the sr emission begins before the ics pulse / flare has ended .",
    "the initial expansion of the cbs and the slow - down of the leading ones by the circumburst matter may merge most of them into a single leading cb @xcite during the afterglow phase .",
    "its collimated beam of the prompt gamma rays ionizes the matter in front of it .",
    "the ions continuously impinging on a cb with a relative lorentz factor @xmath5 , where @xmath5 is the bulk motion lorentz factor of the cb , generate within it an equipartition turbulent magnetic field .",
    "the intercepted electrons are isotropized and fermi accelerated by these fields and emit isotropic synchrotron radiation in the cb s rest frame , which is doppler boosted and beamed relativistically into a narrow cone with a typical opening angle @xmath6 in the observer s rest frame .",
    "late srfs are produced mainly when the cbs encounter winds or density bumps along their path first from the progenitor star and later in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the lightcurve of these flares depends on the unknown density profile of the encountered wind / density bump that can not be predicted a - priori .",
    "but , both the early - time and the late - time srfs have a typical sr spectrum and a weak spectral evolution that are quite different from those of the accretion induced icfs and can be used to identify their origin  late ejection episodes from the central engine or density bumps .    in the cb model , short hard bursts ( shbs ) are also produced by bipolar jets of plasmoids ejected in mergers of compact objects in close binary systems such as neutron stars merger @xcite or in mass accretion episodes on compact objects in close binary systems , or in phase transitions in compact stars ( neutron stars , hyper stars and strange quark stars ) @xcite .",
    "bipolar ejections in late accretion episodes or phase transitions after cooling and loss of angular momentum probably produce the observed icfs in shbs , and sr radiation from encounters with winds / density bumps produces srfs .",
    "flares were routinely included in the cb model description of the afterglows of grbs and shbs @xcite .",
    "they were calculated from the master formulae of the model , which describe well the prompt ics emission and the emission of sr at all times .",
    "it was shown that ics explains successfully both the prompt kev - mev pulses and the x - ray flares ending the prompt emission , while the sr emitted in the collision of the jet of cbs with the wind / ejecta from the progenitor star explains well the prompt optical flares measured with robotic telescopes in very bright grbs @xcite .",
    "however , attention was focused there on the general properties of the prompt emission and the smooth afterglow , rather than on flares during the afterglow phase . moreover ,",
    "in many grb afterglows , flares are weak , or are blended , or are not well sampled , and their properties could neither be inferred reliably from the ag lightcurve nor used reliably to test theoretical models .",
    "the situation concerning prominent x - ray flares observed by the swift xrt is different .",
    "they are well resolved and their spectral properties are much better measured . in this paper",
    "we focus our attention on grb x - ray and optical lightcurves with prominent flares .",
    "in particular , we compare the cb model lightcurves and their spectral evolution with representatives set of x - ray and optical lightcurves measured with the swift xrt , and with ground - based robotic telescopes and swift uvo in space , respectively , which have prominent flares that are well sampled .",
    "such a comparison provides stringent tests of both the cb model and its interpretation of the origin of prompt emission pulses in grbs , their afterglows and the early and late time flares in their lightcurves .",
    "we show that the cb model correctly predicts their main observed properties , and reproduces well their entire lightcurves and spectral properties . for completeness",
    ", we first summarize the relevant master formula of the cb model and their simplified forms that we later use in our analysis of the x - ray and optical lightcurve of grbs .",
    "in this section we summarize the master formula of the cb model for the pulse shape and spectral evolution of ics pulses / flares ( see @xcite and references therein for their derivation ) .",
    "let @xmath7 denote the time in the observer frame after the beginning of a flare .",
    "the light - curve of a flare , produced by the electrons in the cbs by ics of thin bremsstrahlung photons filling the cavity formed by a wind blown by the progenitor star long before the grb , is generally well approximated by @xcite : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a constant that depends on the cb s baryon number , lorentz and doppler factors , and on the density of the glory light and on the redshift and distance of the grb , and @xmath10 , the peak energy of @xmath11 at time @xmath7 , is given roughly by : @xmath12 with @xmath13 being the time ( after the beginning of the flare ) when the ics photon count - rate reaches its peak value .",
    "for @xmath14 , it satisfies @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the peak energy of the time - integrated spectrum of the flare .",
    "thus , in the cb model , each ics pulse in the grb lightcurve is described by four parameters , @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 and the beginning time of the pulse when @xmath7 is taken to be 0 .",

    "<S> the many similarities between the prompt emission pulses in gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) and x - ray flares during the fast decay and afterglow phases of grbs suggest a common origin . in the cannonball ( cb ) model of grbs , </S>",
    "<S> this common origin is mass accretion episodes of fall - back matter on a newly born compact object . </S>",
    "<S> the prompt emission pulses are produced by a bipolar jet of highly relativistic plasmoids ( cbs ) ejected in the early , major episodes of mass accretion . as the accretion material is consumed , one may expect the engine s activity to weaken . </S>",
    "<S> x - ray flares ending the prompt emission and during the afterglow phase are produced in such delayed episodes of mass accretion . </S>",
    "<S> the common engine , environment and radiation mechanisms ( inverse compton scattering and synchrotron radiation ) produce their observed similarities . </S>",
    "<S> flares in both long grbs and short hard gamma ray bursts ( shbs ) can also be produced by bipolar ejections of cbs following a phase transition in compact objects due to loss of angular momentum and/or cooling . </S>",
    "<S> optical flares , however , are mostly produced in collisions of cbs with massive stellar winds / ejecta or with density bumps along their path . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we show that the master formulae of the cb model of grbs and shbs , which reproduce very well their prompt emission pulses and their smooth afterglows , seem to reproduce also very well the lightcurves and spectral evolution of the prominent x - ray and optical flares that are well sampled .    </S>",
