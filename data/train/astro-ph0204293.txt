    "in this paper we show how the temperature and the order ( first order or not ) of the qcd transition in the early universe is important in determining the relic densities of sterile neutrinos in models where they provide the dark matter .",
    "the qcd transition epoch is the regime where the quark and gluon degrees of freedom annihilate , chiral symmetry is broken , and quarks are incorporated into color singlets . for the low chemical potential ( i.e. , small baryon number or high entropy ) characterizing the universe , we expect the qcd epoch to occur at a temperature ( energy scale ) of order of the pion mass , @xmath0 . coincidentally ,",
    "this is the temperature regime where the dark matter singlet neutrinos are produced by scattering - related processes .",
    "therefore , an accurate calculation of the density of dark matter candidate sterile neutrinos requires detailed specification of the evolution of the background plasma through the qcd transition .",
    "it is conceivable that this relation between the qcd transition and sterile neutrino properties could be exploited to understand the cosmic qcd epoch .",
    "this approach is not available , for example , with supersymmetric dark matter candidates which freeze - out of the plasma at temperatures well above the qcd transition . here",

    "there is much optimism in observational cosmology , but a number of unresolved problems remain . among them",
    "is the very nature of particle dark matter and dark energy .",
    "more astrophysically , there may be a discrepancy between the quantity of substructures on galactic scales predicted in numerical simulations using @xmath3 initial conditions and that observed in the local group : the `` dwarf - galaxy problem ''  @xcite .",
    "another discrepancy exists between the observed flat and low density profiles of dwarf galaxy cores  @xcite relative to those found in @xmath4-body simulations .",
    "one solution to the dwarf - galaxy problem is a modification of the primordial power spectrum at sub - galaxy scales by thermal damping of perturbations by warm dark matter ( wdm )  @xcite .",
    "dwarf - galaxy halos in wdm scenarios form through fragmentation of larger structures , and the concentrations of their halos may be reduced  @xcite .",
    "although these problems may be signaling the presence of wdm , the apparent dwarf - galaxy problem may be the result of dispersion of baryons from halos due to late reionization or supernovae , so that the unobserved dwarf halos are simply dark .",
    "these issues could be resolved through refined calculations of star formation in small halos , or through observations of galactic substructure in , for example , gravitational lensing studies  @xcite .",
    "sterile neutrinos are a natural candidate for wdm  @xcite and cdm  @xcite , and can emerge from models with composite fermions  @xcite , mirror fermions @xcite or light axinos  @xcite .",
    "sterile neutrinos with masses of @xmath5 and small mixings with active neutrinos are produced in a nonequilibrium quantum decoherence process associated with the scattering of active neutrinos : either with the usual simplifying assumption of a small universal lepton number  @xcite ( of order of the baryon number ) or with the more liberal possibility of a large lepton number in neutrinos ( several orders of magnitude larger than the baryon number )  @xcite .",
    "we define the lepton number in a neutrino flavor here as the difference between neutrino and antineutrino number densities normalized by the photon number density , @xmath6 , at a given epoch : @xmath7 .",
    "constraints on the lepton numbers which reside in the neutrino seas can be made by requiring successful production of the light element abundances in primordial nucleosynthesis while keeping the baryon density compatible with that inferred from observations of the cosmic microwave anisotropies  @xcite .",
    "because of the near bi - maximal mixing paradigm emerging for the neutrino mass matrix , more stringent constraints can be placed on the neutrino lepton number since asymmetries in the more poorly constrained mu and tau flavors can be converted to an asymmetry in the more stringently constrained electron neutrinos through synchronized flavor transformation  @xcite .",
    "however , even the strongest constraint available , on the electron neutrino lepton number , allows @xmath8 at the epoch of nucleosynthesis . because sterile neutrinos are produced at temperatures much higher than those characterizing big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , and because the lepton number ( unlike degeneracy parameter ) is not a comoving invariant , we quote values of the lepton number at the epoch where @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , the most conservative upper bound on the lepton number at this temperature is weaker by the ratio of the number of statistical degrees of freedom @xmath10 in the plasma , @xmath11 , or @xmath12 .",
    "all lepton - number - driven mechanisms we consider are well within this conservative limit .",
    "depending on their masses and non - thermal energy distributions , the sterile neutrinos produced in the early universe can be cdm , wdm , or hot dark matter ( hdm ) .",
    "the production mechanisms and constraints on these models were studied in refs .",

    "lower bounds on the mass of the wdm particle can be made by requiring that its free - streaming not excessively damp out the small - scale structure , i.e. , behave too much like hdm .",
    "limits of this type come from the observed structure on small scales in the high - redshift lyman-@xmath15 forest  @xcite and by requiring sufficiently early reionization of the universe seen by the gunn - peterson effect  @xcite .",
    "a lower bound on the mass can also be derived from the observed phase - space densities of galaxy cores  @xcite .",

    "convincing theoretical motivation or experimental detection of the critical end point as yet does not exist , and so whether the qcd transition in the early universe behaves as condensing water ( first order ) or thickening pudding ( smooth crossover ) remains to be discovered .",
