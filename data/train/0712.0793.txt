    "englmaier & shlosman ( 2000 ) showed that in galaxies with low central mass concentrations dynamical processes would not favor the formation of central bars , but might instead give rise to nuclear spiral structure in the gas , whose exact parameters depend on the mass distribution and the sound speed.-2    in the late 1990 s , spiral patterns were found around the nuclei of many galaxies , some flocculent , such as m51 ( grillmair et al . 1997 ) , others of grand design connected to outer spiral structure ( laine et al . 1999 ) .",
    "a large bar can , according to englmaier & shlosman ( 2000 ) drive stable spiral morphology in gas well within the inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) radius , right down to the nuclear zone .",

    "we fix the inclination throughout the galaxy disk and assume that the nuclear disk component has a mass - to - light ratio of unity and dominates the nuclear regions of the galaxy . the observed velocity information can then be used to derive the disk parameters ( e.g. , fathi et al .",

    "we see no evidence for the presence of dark matter in the nucleus of this galaxy , however , the nuclear starburst population could lead to a mass - to - light ratio less that one.-2      in m83 , spiral inflow on galactic scales has been reported by l04b .",

    "if the smooth kinematic pa twist in the central @xmath25 pc is associated with a trailing spiral pattern in the circumnuclear regions of m83 ( aligned with the large scale spiral structure of m83 ) , the streaming motions indicate gas inflow along spiral paths ( e.g. , wong et al . 2004 ; maciejewski 2004 ; yuan & yang 2006 ) .",
    "the harmonic decomposition allows us to measure a @xmath11  as high as 50  within the same region .",

    "the bar is the main actor in this scenario , driving the outer spiral arms as well as the inflow from its ilr toward the inner ilr radius .",
    "the highly obscured starburst activity in the central 50 pc radius has been forming stars at a rate of @xmath29   for at least @xmath30 years with signatures of prolonged star formation ( harris et al .",

    "the co  kinematic analysis of l04b clearly showed that molecular gas spirals in from the outer regions down to a galactocentric distance of @xmath31 pc , confirming that gas can be transported efficiently from kpc scales all the way down to hundreds of pc scales close to the nucleus .",
    "our high resolution data allows us to follow this inflow along the spirals down to the central few tens of pc scales.-2    in case of the bar and spiral arms having the same pattern speed , supported by the absence of multiple pattern speeds ( zimmer et al .",
    "2004 ) , the bar in m83 could drive the outer spiral arms ( elmegreen & elmegreen 1995 ) .",
    "our study suggests that the bar also drives the spiral arms in its interior as well as the nuclear starburst . at the outer ilr , just before 20 , the well known patchy ilr ring of m83 is found ( elmegreen et al .",

    "( 2001 ) and calzetti et al .",
    "the derived inner ilr radius agrees with the scale length of the inner disk ( section  [ sec : disk ] ) , confirming the build - up of the inner disk from the outer disk material by resonant interaction exerted by the main bar in m83.-2    we confirm the derived disk parameters by applying the same fit to the one - dimensional `` true '' rotation curve presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : vrot ] , showing that the nuclear disk indeed dominates the nuclear regions of the velocity field .",

    "the zero - velocity curve goes through the dynamical nucleus , twists , and then passes through the bright knot suggested as the optical nucleus at 3  north - east of it .",
