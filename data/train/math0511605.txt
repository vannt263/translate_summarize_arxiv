    "the aim of the present paper is to construct and describe a natural measure on the set of self - avoiding loops in the plane and on any riemann surface . by a self - avoiding loop on a surface @xmath1 , we mean a continuous injective map from the unit circle into @xmath1 modulo monotone reparametrizations ( i.e. we look only at the trace of the loop and forget about its parametrization ) .",
    "we will construct a measure that possess some strong conformal invariance properties , and we shall see that this measure is the only one with these properties .",
    "let us first describe this strong conformal invariance property , phrased in terms of a measure on the set of self - avoiding loops in the plane : we say that such a measure @xmath2 satisfies conformal restriction if for any two conformally equivalent domains @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( i.e. such that there exists a conformal map from @xmath3 onto @xmath4 ) in the plane , the image of the measure @xmath2 restricted to the set of loops that stay in @xmath3 , via any conformal map @xmath5 from @xmath3 onto @xmath4 , is exactly the measure @xmath2 restricted to the set of loops that stay in @xmath4 .    note that this condition implies in particular that the measure @xmath2 is translation - invariant , scale - invariant ( and therefore that it has infinite total mass provided that @xmath6 ) , and that if @xmath2 satisfies conformal restriction , then so does @xmath7 for any positive constant @xmath8 . we are going to say that a measure on the set of self - avoiding loops is non - trivial if for some @xmath9 , the mass of the set of loops of diameter at least @xmath10 and that stay in some disc of radius @xmath11 is neither @xmath12 nor infinite .",
    "we shall prove the following result :    [ t0 ] up to multiplication by a positive constant , there exists a unique non - trivial measure on the set of self - avoiding loops in the plane that satisfies conformal restriction .    before giving some motivation ,",
    "let us now describe the counterpart of this result in term of measures on loops on riemann surfaces .",
    "suppose that for each riemann surface @xmath1 ( we do not require @xmath1 to be closed ) , we are given a measure @xmath13 on the set of self - avoiding loops on @xmath1 .",
    "we say that the family of measures @xmath14 satisfies conformal restriction if the following two conditions hold :    * for any conformal map @xmath5 from one surface @xmath1 onto another surface @xmath0 , @xmath15 * for any @xmath1 and any @xmath16 , @xmath17 is equal to the measure @xmath13 restricted to those loops that stay in @xmath0 .",
    "suppose that the family @xmath14 satisfies conformal restriction .",
    "it is then clear that the measure @xmath18 in this family satisfies conformal restriction in the previous sense .",
    "it is also easy to see that for any riemann surface @xmath1 , one can define a countable family of annular regions ( i.e. conformally equivalent to a planar annular region ) such that any self - avoiding loop in @xmath1 is contained in at least one of these regions .",
    "hence , the knowledge of the @xmath19 s for all annular regions @xmath3 determines the entire family @xmath14 .",
    "one consequence is that the entire family @xmath14 is described by the measure @xmath18 .",
    "this will lead to :    [ t1 ] up to multiplication by a positive constant , there exists a unique family of such measures @xmath14 that satisfies conformal restriction .",
    "the proof of these results will consist of two different parts .",
    "first , one shows that there exists at most one measure @xmath2 that satisfies conformal restriction , and then one constructs explicitely a measure @xmath2 that possesses this property .",
    "as we shall see , the first step is not very difficult and requires no prerequisite . on the other hand ,",
    "the existence part of the proof of the theorem is non - trivial . recall that we are not restricting ourselves to simply connected domains @xmath3 ;",
    "for instance , the measure @xmath2 will be invariant under the inversion @xmath20 from @xmath21 onto itself .    [ f1 ]        let us now list some other properties of the measures described in theorems [ t0 ] and [ t1 ] that we shall derive in this paper :    * for any given simply connected domain @xmath22 , for any simply connected @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , consider the conformal map @xmath5 from @xmath4 onto @xmath3 that fixes @xmath25 and that has a positive derivative at @xmath25 .",
    "then @xmath26 for some @xmath8 .",
    "this formula ( for fixed @xmath3 and letting @xmath25 and @xmath4 vary ) characterizes the measure @xmath19 fully ( and therefore @xmath2 too because of its scale - invariance ) .",
    "* the measure @xmath2 can be viewed as the measure on outer boundaries of planar brownian loops in the plane , where these brownian loops are defined under the `` brownian loop measure '' introduced in @xcite .",
    "this is roughly speaking a scale - invariant and translation - invariant measure on ( unrooted ) brownian loops in the plane .",
    "* for each riemann surface @xmath1 ( and in particular for @xmath27 ) , the measure @xmath13 is supported on the set of loops with hausdorff dimension @xmath28 ( see figure [ f1 ] ) .",
    "this will follow from the construction of @xmath2 via outer boundaries of brownian loops that we have just mentioned ( recall that it has been proved see @xcite that the dimension of outer boundaries of two - dimensional brownian motions is @xmath28 ) .",
    "* one can also view the measures @xmath13 as measures on `` schramm - loewner evolutions loops '' with parameter @xmath29 .",
    "this is related to the special properties of sle with that parameter ( e.g. @xcite )",
    ". it will be an instrumental fact in the proof of theorems [ t0 ] and [ t1 ] .",
    "* one can also interpret the measure @xmath2 as the scaling limit of the measure on critical percolation cluster outer perimeters .",
    "in particular , this will show that the shapes of percolation cluster outer perimeters in the scaling limit are exactly the same ( in law ) as that of brownian loops .",
    "* the @xmath2 mass of the set of loops that stay and go `` around '' the annulus @xmath30 decays like a constant times @xmath31 when @xmath32 .",
    "this estimate also holds for other annular regions by conformal invariance .",
    "this last estimate can be related to the conjecture that the measures @xmath13 are the scaling limits of simple measures on self - avoiding polygons on fine - mesh discrete approximations of the surface @xmath1 ( see section [ section6.1 ] and @xcite ) .",
    "roughly speaking , @xmath7 for some @xmath8 should be the fine - mesh limit ( i.e. @xmath33 ) of the measure that assign a mass @xmath34 to each self - avoiding loop @xmath35 on the grid @xmath36 , where @xmath37 denotes the number of steps of the loop @xmath35 , and @xmath38 is the connectivity constant of the lattice @xmath39 .    the description of measures @xmath2 in terms of brownian outer boundaries or percolation outer perimeters in the scaling limit , combined with the properties of the measures @xmath2 ( such for instance as the invariance under inversion @xmath40 ) has in turn rather surprising consequences for brownian loops and shapes of percolation clusters .",
    "in particular , it will show that the shapes of `` outer '' and `` inner '' boundaries have exactly the same law .",
    "the paper will be structured as follows : in the next section , which can be viewed as the second part of the introduction , we make some further general comments and recall a few general facts and ideas from the papers @xcite and @xcite . in section [ s3 ] , we show uniqueness of the measure @xmath2 satisfying a weaker form of conformal restriction ( namely that the restrictions of @xmath2 to simply connected sets are all conformally equivalent ) .",
    "this implies in particular the uniqueness part of theorem [ t0 ] . in the subsequent section , we",
    "will then show how to construct a measure @xmath2 satisfying this weak conformal restriction property using the brownian loop measures ( to each brownian loop we associate its outer boundary which is a self - avoiding loop ) .",
    "we will then focus on the restriction of this measure to annular regions .",
    "in particular , using sle@xmath41 considerations , we shall prove that for any two conformally equivalent annular regions in the plane , the restriction of @xmath2 to the second one is equal to the conformal image of the restriction of @xmath2 to the first one .",
    "this will in turn imply theorem [ t0 ] and show that it is possible to define @xmath13 for any surface in such a way that the obtained family of measures satisfies conformal restriction ( i.e. that theorem [ t1 ] holds too ) . in the final two sections , we will study asymptotics of the mass of loops that go around thin annuli ( motivated by the discrete self - avoiding walks problems ) and the relation to critical percolation .",
    "this paper builds on ideas of the joint paper with greg lawler and oded schramm on conformal restriction in the chordal case @xcite , and uses also the brownian loop measure introduced in joint work with greg lawler @xcite .",
    "a survey of the results concerning sle with parameter @xmath29 and brownian measures ( on excursions and loops ) that we will use can for instance be found in the first four sections of @xcite .",
    "let us however briefly recall some aspects of the two papers @xcite now in order to put our results into perspective :    because of its conformal invariance , planar brownian motion can be a useful tool to interpret and prove results in complex analysis ( e.g. @xcite ) even though many questions in this field were already settled long before brownian motion was properly defined .",
    "usually , by conformal invariance of planar brownian motion one means that the conformal image of a brownian motion started at a given point in a given domain is a ( time - changed ) brownian motion in the image domain started at the image of the starting point ( this had been first observed by paul lvy in the 1950 s and it can be viewed as a direct consequence of it s formula , see e.g. @xcite ) . if one does however not prescribe any starting point on a riemann surface and still wants to state a conformal invariance property for measures on brownian paths , it is natural to look for measures on brownian loops . in @xcite , we defined a measure on brownian loops in the complex plane ( and subsets of the complex plane ) that is indeed conformally invariant .",
    "more precisely , it satisfies a property similar to the conformal restriction that we described before ( but of course , brownian loops are not simple loops ) : the image under a conformal map @xmath5 of the measure on brownian loops restricted to those that stay in a domain @xmath22 is exactly the measure on brownian loops restricted to those loops that stay in @xmath42 . as we shall see later in this paper , it is easy to generalize the definition of the brownian loop measure to general riemann surfaces and to show that this conformal restriction property still holds .    in the case of hyperbolic surfaces ( where green s functions are finite ) such for instance as the bounded subsets of @xmath43 ,",
    "quantities like the mass of brownian loops that intersect two disjoint sets turn out to be rather natural conformal invariants that are for instance related to schwarzian derivatives ( see e.g. @xcite ) and they show up under various guises in conformal field theory .",
    "furthermore @xcite , it is natural to construct poissonized samples of these brownian loop - measures ( that we call the brownian loop - soups in @xcite ) and to study the geometry of the obtained sets @xcite .",
    "this gives a way to construct the so - called conformal loop ensembles ( cle ) that are conjectured to be the scaling limits of various critical two - dimensional models from statistical physics , see @xcite .",
    "the brownian loop - measure on compact surfaces ( for which green s functions are infinite ) , such for instance the riemann sphere , is still easy to define but not so easy to work with .",
    "for instance , the mass of the set of loops that intersect two disjoint open sets is infinite because of the too many long loops ( due to the recurrence of the brownian motion ) .",
    "this implies in particular that the corresponding brownian loop - soups become rather uninteresting , because there always exists just one dense cluster of loops .",
    "however , it should be possible to define the cles and conformal field theories on such surfaces in order to describe scaling limits of lattice models .",
    "we shall see that the measure on self - avoiding loops @xmath13 that we are defining is in a way better - suited to higher - genus surfaces and compact surfaces than the brownian loop - measure . for simply connected planar domains ,",
    "the self - avoiding loop measure @xmath2 is very directly related to the brownian loop measure ( it is the measure on `` outer boundaries of the brownian loops '' ) and therefore also to schwarzian derivatives etc .",
    "its poissonian samples also define the same cles as the brownian loop - measure does .",
    "but these nice properties will still hold for any riemann surface .",
    "for instance , it allows to construct directly loop - clusters for a loop - soup in the entire plane . in this setup ,",
    "all the nice properties of the obtained cluster boundaries are just consequences of the conformal restriction property of the family @xmath14 .",
    "let us now briefly recall some aspects of conformal restriction in the chordal case , as studied in @xcite .",
    "there , we focused on probability measures on self - avoiding curves that join two prescribed boundary points of simply connected domains ( we will only discuss simply connected domains in this paragraph ) .",
    "the law of such a curve was therefore characterized by the domain @xmath3 and also by the two end - points @xmath44 and @xmath45 of the path .",
    "we showed that there exists a unique family @xmath46 of probability measures on that set of self - avoiding curves , that satisfies conformal invariance ( i.e. @xmath47 ) and restriction in the sense that the law of the curve in @xmath3 , _ conditioned _ to stay in @xmath4 was equal to the law in the smaller domain with the boundary points @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the constraint on @xmath4 is that @xmath44 and @xmath45 are also boundary points of @xmath4 and for instance that @xmath48 is at positive distance of @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( to ensure that the curve stays in @xmath4 with positive probability so that the conditioning makes sense ) .",
    "furthermore ( see @xcite for more details ) , we showed that @xmath49 when @xmath5 is a conformal map from @xmath50 back onto @xmath3 that preserves the two boundary points @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "one can then try to define a family of measures @xmath51 on such curves in such a way that @xmath51 restricted to those curves that stay in @xmath4 is exactly equal to @xmath52 .",
    "in other words , we allow the measure to have a total mass different to 1 , but we require that the restriction property holds with no renormalizing term ( for the family @xmath53 , there is such a term due to the conditioning ) . let us add the technical condition that we restrict the definition of @xmath51 to those sets @xmath3 and points @xmath44 , @xmath45 , such that the boundary of @xmath3 is smooth in the neighborhood of @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "then , we simply define @xmath54 where @xmath5 is a conformal map from some fixed reference domain ( say @xmath55 ) onto @xmath56 . the family of measures @xmath51 is then defined modulo a multiplicative constant ( corresponding to the choice of the reference domain ) and can be shown to be the unique one ( on the set of simple paths from one boundary point to another of smooth simply connected domains ) satisfying this restriction property .",
    "it was very natural to study this chordal restriction property in the light of the definition and properties of the chordal schramm - loewner evolutions that are precisely random paths joining one boundary point of a domain to another .",
    "in fact , the probability @xmath53 is exactly the law of the sle with parameter @xmath29 in @xmath3 from @xmath44 to @xmath45 .",
    "it also turned out ( see e.g. @xcite ) that this chordal restriction property of sle with parameter @xmath29 had interpretations in terms of boundary conformal field theory , and that it yields a simple definition of the sle@xmath41 in non - simply connected domains . also , a by - product of the results of @xcite was the fact that the brownian outer boundary looked `` locally '' like that of a critical percolation boundary , and also like a sle@xmath41 , because of global identities in law between outer boundaries of the union of 5 brownian excursions and that of the union of 8 sle@xmath41 s .",
    "this showed that `` locally '' , the inside boundaries and the outside boundaries of the brownian loops and of percolation clusters looked like an sle@xmath41 .",
    "so , we see that part of the present paper is really a continuation of some of the ideas developed in @xcite . in a way , just as for the brownian loops compared to brownian motions , the measure on self - avoiding loops @xmath2 in the plane is invariant under a wider class of transformations than the chordal measures , because no marked points are prescribed .",
    "this will make it well - suited to general riemann surfaces and to the description and construction of conformally invariant quantities and objects .",
    "* further motivation . *",
    "it is also worth emphasizing that the conformal restriction property enables us to understand the behavior of these measures when one distorts locally the riemann surface ( for instance , one cuts out a small disc and glues some other structure ) , so that @xmath2 provides conformally invariant information that behaves nicely under perturbation of the conformal structure .",
    "we believe that it is a natural and hopefully fruitful way to describe useful conformal invariant quantities in this setup @xcite .",
    "also , one can note ( see e.g. @xcite ) that the space of shapes of self - avoiding loops ( as we shall define it later in the paper ) can be realized in many different ways in particular involving the lie algebra vect@xmath57 , and that it has been the subject of many investigations ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we hope to clarify the link with the present paper in @xcite .",
    "measures on loops should also be the natural setup for considerations related to the geometric - theoretical aspects of sle as looked into in @xcite .",
    "this section requires no prerequisite ( i.e. no knowledge on brownian loops nor on sle ) .",
    "let us settle a few technical details : throughout the paper , when we will talk about self - avoiding loops , we will not care about their time - parametrizations . in other words , we identify two self - avoiding loops as soon as their traces are the same .",
    "this means that two injective continuous maps @xmath58 and @xmath59 from the unit circle @xmath60 into some domain define the same loop if there exists a continuous monotone bijection @xmath61 from @xmath60 onto @xmath60 such that @xmath62 .",
    "note that with this definition , a path of zero length ( i.e. `` a point '' ) is not a self - avoiding loop .",
    "this set of self - avoiding loops can be endowed with various natural metrics .",
    "we will not discuss this here , but we have at least to specify precisely what @xmath63-field we will implicitly refer to when we define measures on this set . throughout the paper , we will say that a bounded open set @xmath44 is an annular region ( not to be confused with exact annuli ) in the plane if it is conformally equivalent to some annulus @xmath64 . in other words , @xmath44 is a bounded open set and @xmath65 has two connected components ( that are not singletons ) .",
    "the bounded connected component of @xmath65 will be called the `` hole '' of @xmath44 . for each such annular region @xmath44 , define the set @xmath66 of self - avoiding loops that stay in @xmath44 and that have a non - zero index around the hole of @xmath44 ( or in other words , that disconnects the two connected components of @xmath67 ) .",
    "we will denote by @xmath68 the @xmath63-field generated by this family .",
    "this is the @xmath63-field that we will work with ( we leave it to the interested reader to check the relation between @xmath68 and the borel @xmath63-field induced by the hausdorff distance on the set of self - avoiding loops ) .",
    "we will also use the countable family @xmath69 of annular regions @xmath44 such that the inner and the outer boundaries of @xmath44 consist of finite loops that are drawn on the lattice @xmath70 for some @xmath71 .",
    "clearly , since any annular region can be seen as the increasing limit of such dyadic annular regions , the family @xmath72 generates @xmath68 too .",
    "the sets of self - avoiding loops that we shall consider can be easily shown to be in @xmath68 ( for instance because they are countable unions of @xmath66 s ) .    when @xmath2 is a measure supported on the set of self - avoiding loops in the complex plane , then , for each simply connected domain @xmath3 ( unless otherwise stated , domains are open sets ) , we simply define @xmath19 to be the measure @xmath2 restricted to the set of loops that stay in @xmath3 . throughout this paper , by a slight abuse of notation ,",
    "we will write @xmath73 ( instead of @xmath74 ) .    recall that we say that a measure on the set of self - avoiding loops is non - trivial if for some @xmath75 , the mass of the set of loops of diameter at least @xmath10 that are contained some disc of radius @xmath11 , is neither zero nor infinity .",
    "we will also use a weaker form of conformal restriction in this paper : we will say that a measure @xmath2 on the set of self - avoiding loops in the plane satisfies _ weak _ conformal restriction if for any two simply connected domains @xmath3 , @xmath4 and any conformal map @xmath5 from @xmath3 onto @xmath4 , @xmath76 the difference with the ( strong ) conformal restriction is that here , the domains @xmath3 and @xmath4 are simply connected .",
    "we can now state the main result of this section :    [ p1 ] up to multiplication by a positive constant , there exists at most one non - trivial measure @xmath2 ( on the set of self - avoiding loops ) satisfying weak conformal restriction .",
    "furthermore , for any simply connected sets @xmath77 , and any @xmath78 , @xmath79 where @xmath8 is a positive constant ( depending on @xmath2 only ) , and @xmath5 denotes the conformal map from @xmath80 onto @xmath3 such that @xmath81 and @xmath82 is a positive real .",
    "this result does not say anything about whether this measure exists .",
    "we will also prove the following closely related lemma .",
    "it is a similar result for measures on loops that surround a given point .",
    "suppose that @xmath83 is a non - trivial measure supported on the set of self - avoiding loops in the complex plane that disconnect @xmath12 from infinity .",
    "for any simply connected domain @xmath3 containing the origin , we define again @xmath84 .",
    "[ l1 ] up to multiplication by a positive constant , there exists at most one such measure @xmath83 such that for any simply connected domain @xmath3 containing the origin and any conformal map @xmath5 defined on @xmath3 such that @xmath85 , one has @xmath86 .",
    "furthermore , there exists a positive constant @xmath8 such that for any simply connected subset @xmath87 of the unit disc @xmath88 such that @xmath89 , @xmath90 where @xmath5 is the conformal map from @xmath87 onto @xmath88 such that @xmath91 and @xmath92",
    ".    we will first prove the lemma .",
    "* proof of the lemma . *",
    "suppose that @xmath83 is a measure supported on the set of self - avoiding loops that surround the origin , such that for any simply connected domain @xmath3 containing the origin and any conformal map @xmath93 with @xmath94 , one has @xmath95 .",
    "our first goal is to prove that it necessarily satisfies ( [ e4 ] ) .",
    "consider a simply connected subset @xmath87 of the unit disc that contains the origin .",
    "we define the unique conformal map @xmath96 from @xmath87 onto @xmath88 with @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "note that as @xmath99 , @xmath100 ( recall for instance that if @xmath101 is a planar brownian motion started from the origin and stopped at its first exit time @xmath102 of @xmath87 , then @xmath103 ) .",
    "note that @xmath104 describes @xmath87 fully as @xmath105 .",
    "we now define @xmath106    , height=96 ]    this quantity measures the mass of the set of loops that stay in the unit disc but do exit the smaller domain @xmath87 ( recall also that @xmath83 is supported on the set of loops that surround the origin ) . now , under the conditions of the lemma , it is immediate to see that for any simply connected subsets @xmath87 and @xmath107 of the unit disc that do contain the origin , @xmath108 indeed , @xmath109 is the mass of loops that surround the origin , stay in @xmath88 , but hit @xmath110 or @xmath111 . note that these two sets are disjoint . but by definition @xmath112 and @xmath113 by conformal invariance ( via @xmath114 , we see that this second quantity is also equal to @xmath115 summing ( [ + 1 ] ) and ( [ + 2 ] ) , we get ( [ + ] ) .",
    "let us now focus on a simple class of domains @xmath116 in @xmath88 : for each positive @xmath117 , we let @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the positive real such that @xmath120 ( it is not difficult to work out the explicit expression of @xmath119 but we do not need it here ) . note that with this definition , the family @xmath121 is a semi - group ( i.e. @xmath122 ) because ( by symmetry ) , the composition of these two maps is still a map from some @xmath123 onto @xmath88 , and @xmath124 because @xmath125 .",

    "let @xmath135 denote the semi - group of conformal maps generated by the family @xmath136 , @xmath131 , @xmath137 ( i.e. the set of finite compositions of such maps ) . because of ( [ + ] ) , we deduce from the above that for any @xmath138 , @xmath139    the family @xmath135 is `` dense '' in the class of conformal maps @xmath140 from some simply connected subset @xmath87 onto @xmath88 in the following sense ( this is a standard fact from the theory developed by loewner ) : for any @xmath87 , there exists an increasing family @xmath141 in @xmath135 such that @xmath142 .",
    "clearly , it follows that @xmath143 .",
    "furthermore , because a loop is a compact subset of the complex plane , @xmath144 exits @xmath87",

    "the lemma will then follow from rather simple measure - theoretical considerations that we now detail .",
    "recall that a finite measure on a measurable space is characterized by its total mass and its value on a subset of the @xmath63-field that generates the @xmath63-field and that is stable under finite intersections .    until the end of this proof",

    "we have reduced the class of measures on loops that satisfy weak conformal restriction to a possibly empty one - dimensional ( i.e. via multiplication by constants ) family of measures .",
    "it is of course natural to try to construct such a measure , to make sure that this family is not empty .",
    "we are going to do this using the brownian loop - measure introduced with greg lawler in @xcite .      since it is an instrumental tool throughout the present paper , it is worthwhile to recall the construction of the brownian loop - measure defined in @xcite ( in @xmath43 and subsets of @xmath43 ) and its basic properties .",

    "we identify two brownian loops if one can be obtained from the other by an `` increasing '' reparametrization ( which is more than just identifying the traces since the brownian motions have double points  as opposed to the self - avoiding loops ) .",
    "however , and we shall use this in a moment , a brownian loop @xmath101 carries its `` natural '' time - parametrization given by its quadratic variation .",
    "it has a natural time - length @xmath200 which is not a conformally invariant quantity .",
    "in fact , it is easy to see that @xmath201 when @xmath101 is parametrized by its `` natural '' time .",

    "but , of course , brownian loops are not self - avoiding .",
    "however , for each brownian loop @xmath101 , we can define its `` outer boundary '' @xmath218 .",
    "more precisely , it is the boundary of the unbounded connected component of the complement of @xmath101 .",
    "it is not difficult to see that it is a continuous curve ( it is the outer boundary of a continuous loop ) and furthermore , it can be proved ( e.g. @xcite ) that it is a self - avoiding loop ( in other words , the brownian loop has no cut - points  these would correspond to double cut - points on a brownian curve , and a priori estimates can be used to prove that such points do almost surely not exist on a brownian curve ) .",
    "hence , @xmath209 induces a measure on ( unrooted ) self - avoiding loops in the plane .",
    "this measure exists and it satisfies conformal restriction in simply connected domains , because the outer boundary of the image of @xmath101 under a conformal map @xmath5 defined on a simply connected domain @xmath3 , is the image under @xmath5 of the outer boundary of @xmath101 . combining this with the results of the previous section , we get the existence of the measure @xmath2 ( note that this measure can be viewed as defined on @xmath68 because @xmath210 and @xmath209 are a priori defined on a richer @xmath63-field ; there are no measurability problems here ) :    there exists a non - trivial measure @xmath2 on the set of self - avoiding loops in the plane that does satisfy weak conformal restriction .",

    "let us now focus on the measure @xmath83 on loops surrounding the origin described in the previous section and on its brownian interpretation . clearly , taking the measure @xmath2 restricted to those loops that surround the origin gives a way to construct @xmath83 .",
    "on the other hand , the measure @xmath221 on brownian loops rooted at the origin defines also a measure on self - avoiding loops surrounding the origin .",
    "furthermore , the conformal invariance property of @xmath221 implies that this measure on self - avoiding loops also satisfies the conformal restriction property that we require for @xmath83 .",
    "hence :    [ p6 ] there exists a measure @xmath83 that satisfies the conditions of lemma [ l1 ] .",

    "let us insist on the fact that the two brownian measures @xmath222 and @xmath221 are very different , so that this lat result can seem somewhat surprising .",
    "the second measure on loops is supported on rooted loops that go through the origin , while for the first one , ( almost ) no loop does go through the origin .",
    "we now collect some further consequences of the previous facts concerning the brownian loop measures .",
    "these results are not really needed in our construction of the measure @xmath2 for general surfaces , but we write these consequences now to emphasize that their proof does ( mostly ) not use any sle - based argument , but just properties of planar brownian motion and conformal maps .",

    "the measure on outer boundaries of brownian loops defined under @xmath188 and @xmath224 restricted to those loops that surround both @xmath25 and @xmath223 are identical .",
    "this is just due to the fact that both measures coincide with ( a constant times ) the one defined by @xmath209 on this family of loops .",
    "let us remark that it is important in the previous corollary to consider the measures @xmath188 with no prescribed time - length for the brownian loops .",
    "indeed , the following fact shows that some maybe tempting conjectures are false :    define a brownian loop of time - length @xmath102 started from the point @xmath25 , and its outer boundary @xmath144 .",
    "define another brownian loop of time - length @xmath102 started from the point @xmath223 and its outer boundary @xmath225 .",
    "the laws of @xmath144 and of @xmath225 on the set of loops that surround both @xmath25 and @xmath223 do not ( always ) coincide .",

    "note that loops of time - length @xmath230 that surround both the origin and @xmath229 are rare .",
    "then , we focus on the mass of the set of loops that surround the circle of radius @xmath229 around the origin . in the case of the brownian loop from @xmath229 to @xmath229 , a typical loop of time - length @xmath230 with an outer boundary that surrounds the unit circle is going very fast around the circle . in the case of the loop from @xmath12 to @xmath12 ,",
    "the loop has first to reach the circle , then to go around it , and finally to come back to the origin , and this has a much smaller probability ( in the @xmath231 regime ) .",
    "let us make a little general comment on shapes for scale - invariant measures on random compact sets .",
    "we are going to write it in the case of @xmath221 , but it can clearly be adapted to the other measures that we will discuss in this paper . if we `` scale out '' the scale factor , we can see that @xmath221 defines a probability measure on the set of possible `` shapes '' . in this brownian case , we say that @xmath101 and @xmath232 have the same shape if for some @xmath233 , @xmath234 .",
    "in other words , we look at the set of rooted loops modulo scaling .",
    "there exists many different ( measurable ) ways to choose a given representative for each shape ( i.e. for each equivalence class of loops ) .",
    "one can for instance use the `` natural brownian time - parametrization '' of the loop @xmath101 , and choose the representative such that @xmath235 ( this definition works well for @xmath221-almost all loops ) .",
    "another possibility is to choose the representative such that the maximal distance to the origin on the loop is @xmath230 .",
    "consider the probability measure @xmath236 on brownian loops in the plane of time - length @xmath230 ( i.e. the real and imaginary parts are independent brownian bridges of time - length @xmath230 ) .",

    "if we look at @xmath238 where @xmath239 is defined under this product measure , it is easy to see that it is defined under the measure @xmath221 .",
    "similarly , scaling shows that @xmath240 where @xmath241 is this time the law of a brownian loop of time - length @xmath102 .",
    "clearly , for any positive real random variable @xmath87 ( that can depend on @xmath101  but does not interact with @xmath197 ) , we see that the measure of @xmath242 is always the same . in particular , this shows that one can view @xmath221 as obtained by taking the product of @xmath197 ( defined under the measure @xmath243 ) and a probability measure @xmath244 on the space of representatives ( i.e. of shapes ) of brownian loops .",
    "conversely , one way to define @xmath244 from @xmath221 goes as follows ( we safely leave this as an exercise to the reader ) : define the set of loops @xmath245 that lie in the annulus @xmath246 . then , consider the measure on shapes defined by @xmath247 .",

    "hence , it follows immediately that the constant @xmath8 in ( [ e4 ] ) is equal to 1 for @xmath221 .    in the case of @xmath209",
    ", it is more complicated to compute the constant @xmath8 .",
    "the starting point of the loop is chosen away from the origin and one has to keep only those loops that surround the origin .",
    "let us now look at the set @xmath44 of self - avoiding loops that surround the origin and have time - length between @xmath230 and @xmath251 . clearly , @xmath252 where @xmath253 denotes the area of the inside of the self - avoiding loop defined by @xmath101 .",
    "clearly , @xmath254 because of scaling .",

    "hence , at each scale , the area @xmath253 scales like the time - length of @xmath101 .",

    "in fact , it is possible to construct various other multiples of @xmath83 using the brownian loop measure @xmath209 .",
    "we list some of the possibilities :    * note that a brownian loop @xmath101 defines an integer index around any point @xmath258 , and in particular , around the origin ( since for @xmath209-almost every loop @xmath101 , @xmath259 ) .",
    "let us call @xmath260 this index .",

    "it is easy to see that this measure satisfies conformal restriction too , so that it is a multiple of the measure @xmath221 .",
    "the constant can be easily identified via the law of the index of the brownian loop ( see @xcite ) . * for each loop @xmath101 , we define the connected components @xmath263 of the complement of @xmath101 .",
    "we define a graph on this set of connected components as follows : we say that @xmath263 and @xmath264 are neighbors , if there exists a point on the loop that touches both @xmath265 and @xmath266 .",
    "it is easy to see that the existence of cut - points on planar brownian curves ( first proved in @xcite ) implies that each @xmath263 has infinitely many neighbors .",

    "we have now constructed a measure on self - avoiding loops as outer boundaries of planar brownian loops .",

    "one of the main points of the present paper is however to show that  even if its brownian construction does not work anymore  the measure on self - avoiding loops that it defines does still satisfy conformal restriction in annular regions , and therefore also on any riemann surface .",

    "let us recall the steps in our construction of @xmath2 . in the simply connected case ( and for genus @xmath394 ) , we constructed the measure @xmath2 using outer boundaries of brownian loops defined under the loop measure .",

    "in fact , we have just proved the following :    consider a brownian loop @xmath101 defined under the brownian loop measure @xmath209 , and call its outer boundary @xmath144 as before .",
    "define also the boundary @xmath399 of the connected component of @xmath400 that contains the origin . note that @xmath401 unless @xmath101 disconnect @xmath12 from infinity .",

    "suppose that @xmath101 is a brownian loop defined under the measure @xmath209 .",
    "define the family @xmath402 of its boundaries ( i.e. the boundaries of the connected components of its complement .",
    "then , define the measure on self - avoiding loops @xmath403 as @xmath404 ( i.e. we take all loops simultaneously ) .",
    "note that the complement of the brownian loop has of course only finitely many large connected components ( the number of small loops has been studied in @xcite ) .",
    "[ c15 ] we have @xmath405 .    * proof . *",
    "the measure @xmath406 is clearly translation - invariant .",
    "furthermore , if we look at the measure @xmath406 restricted to those loops that disconnect the origin from infinity , we see that we count once the inner boundary , and once the outer boundary ( if @xmath101 disconnects the origin ) and nothing else .",
    "the result follows .    for any multiply connected subset @xmath3 of the plane",
    ", it is always possible to view @xmath19 as a measure on outer boundaries of brownian loops : one just has to fill in all the holes except a given prescribed one ( this defines a simply connected subset of the riemann sphere ) and to consider outer boundaries of brownian loops defined in this domain .",
    "the conformal invariance of @xmath19 has some other consequences .",

    "these two sets are conformally equivalent ( let @xmath330 denote the conformal map from @xmath409 onto @xmath373 that is symmetric with respect to the real axis ) .",
    "one can view @xmath410 as the measure on outer boundaries @xmath144 of brownian loops @xmath101 in @xmath43 , restricted to those loops such that @xmath411 .",
    "but , one can also view it as the conformal image via @xmath330 of the measure of outer boundaries of brownian loops @xmath101 in @xmath43 such that @xmath412 = \\emptyset$ ] .",
    "hence , as for outer boundaries that do not intersect @xmath88 are concerned , one can replace the brownian loops in @xmath43 by `` brownian loops in the simply connected domain obtained from @xmath413 by identifying all conjugated points @xmath414 and @xmath415 on @xmath416 . ''",
    "let us also note that the fact that one brownian loop defines infinitely many boundaries is not in contradiction with the fact that @xmath405 because we are talking about scale - invariant ( infinite ) measure .",
    "in fact , since the lebesgue measure of a brownian path is zero , it is clear that the area enclosed by the outer boundary of a brownian loop is identical to the sum of all areas of the inner boundaries of the same loop ( so that this sum converges ) , which is another way to see why this identity holds ( with the factor @xmath417 ) .",
    "also , recall that for a brownian loop of time - length @xmath230 , it is known @xcite that the number of inner boundaries that enclose an area at least @xmath418 behaves almost surely like @xmath419 as @xmath420 ( this question was raised by ... mandelbrot ) .",
    "furthermore , the result of @xcite shows that in fact it is enough to look at the sample of one brownian loop to describe fully the measure @xmath2 in @xmath43 : if @xmath384 is a function of the `` shape '' ( i.e. a function invariant under scaling and translations ) of a connected component , and if @xmath421 are the bounded connected components of the complement of the brownian loop ordered by decreasing area , then @xcite @xmath422 tends ( in @xmath423 ) to `` @xmath424 '' , where @xmath425 is in fact the expected value of @xmath384 for the probability measure on the shape of the outer boundary of a brownian loop .",
    "let us now say a few words on the relation between brownian loop measures and @xmath13 , when the surface @xmath1 has a higher genus ( for instance when @xmath1 is the torus @xmath426 )",
    ".    we can start with the case where @xmath1 is compact ( since the other cases will follow from restriction ) .",
    "we first have to define properly the brownian loop measure .",
    "it is quite clear how to proceed : for each @xmath427 , we can define the brownian loop measure @xmath428 in @xmath1 rooted at @xmath25 in a similar way as in @xmath43 by taking the limit when @xmath193 of @xmath429 times the law of a brownian motion on @xmath1 , started uniformly on the circle of radius @xmath191 around @xmath25 and stopped at its first hitting time of the circle of radius @xmath192 around @xmath25 .",
    "note that we can define for each loop , its natural time @xmath200 ( given for by its total quadratic variation ) , but that this notion depends on the choice of a metric on @xmath1 ( they are only defined locally modulo conformal invariance ) .    after arguing that the map @xmath430 is in some sense measurable ( one can for instance couple @xmath188 and @xmath431 when @xmath25 and @xmath432 are close ) , we can define the measure @xmath433 where @xmath203 denote here the chosen metric on @xmath1 .",
    "this is now a measure on the set of rooted brownian loops in @xmath1 .",
    "finally , we erase the information of where the root is on @xmath101 , and define the corresponding measure @xmath434 on unrooted brownian loops in @xmath1 .",
    "note that when the genus of @xmath1 is zero , this is the same as the brownian measure that we have studied earlier in this paper .",
    "the proof of conformal invariance and restriction for this family of measures @xmath434 is then essentially identical to that of the restrictions of the planar measure @xmath435 .",
    "a first remark is that the boundaries of connected components of the complement of a brownian loop defined under @xmath434 are not necessarily self - avoiding anymore , even for `` planar connected components '' .",
    "consider for instance the torus @xmath436 .",
    "it can happen ( i.e. with positive mass ) that the brownian loop goes around the torus in both directions ( i.e. for instance that in the covering surface @xmath43 it goes through the neighborhood of the origin , then stays close to the segment @xmath437 $ ] and then to the segment @xmath438 $ ] and closes the loop near @xmath439 ) and that the path has local cut - points .",
    "at such a cut point , locally , both sides of the brownian motion are in the same connected component of @xmath440 .",
    "hence , the boundary of this connected component has a double point ( and in fact , it has many cut points i.e. the dimension of the set of cut points is @xmath441 , see @xcite ) .    on the other hand , for a given surface @xmath1 , the @xmath434-mass of the set of loops such that the boundaries of the connected components of its complement in @xmath1 are",
    "not all simple curves is finite .",
    "hence , focusing our attention on those loops that have simple boundaries is not so restrictive .",
    "one could then see whether there is a direct relation to the measure @xmath2 .",
    "the answer does not seem a priori obvious .",
    "recall for instance from @xcite that a brownian excursion `` conditioned to have no cut - point '' defines a restriction measure of parameter @xmath417 , i.e. the outer boundary is the same as two sle@xmath41 conditioned not to intersect .",
    "this shows that there might ( maybe surprisingly ) still exist a direct relation between @xmath2 and boundaries of some brownian loops in this case .",
    "the measure @xmath13 defines ( deterministic ) global quantities related to the riemann surface @xmath1 . for instance , one can look at the total mass of the set of loops in a given homology class .",
    "these quantities therefore provide ways to describe the moduli space of riemann surfaces .",
    "furthermore , the restriction property of @xmath2 makes it well - suited to the study of `` local deformations '' of the complex structure .",
    "in particular , suppose that two riemann surfaces @xmath1 and @xmath0 coincide almost everywhere , but are different `` inside a small circle @xmath442 '' .",
    "then , the only difference between @xmath13 and @xmath17 concerns just those loops that go through the domain encircled by @xmath442 .",
    "hence , one can control the variation of the macroscopic observables defined by the measures @xmath2 with respect to `` infinitesimal variations '' of the riemann structure .",
    "we plan to investigate this further in upcoming work @xcite .",
    "recent attention ( e.g. @xcite ) has been devoted to the question of generalizing the definition of sle to non - simply connected domains .",
    "more generally , one can try to define sle on any riemann surface .",
    "the present construction of @xmath2 on any riemann surface together with the construction of conformal loop - ensembles @xcite ( see also @xcite ) via poissonian clouds of self - avoiding loops gives a way to define families of sle - loops on any riemann surface ( even if it does not have a boundary ) .",
    "note that in the case of surfaces with boundaries ( and therefore finite greens functions ) , a poissonian cloud of brownian loops leads to the same type of simple cle , but for compact surfaces , the brownian loop - clusters become dense and uninteresting , while the clusters of self - avoiding loops still make sense .",
    "a motivation for the present paper is the desire to understand better the behavior of long self - avoiding walks on planar lattices and the related conjectures . for some background and recent status on these conjectures , see @xcite .",
    "let us mention here the following conjecture from @xcite : consider a regular periodic planar lattice @xmath443 ( to fix ideas , let us suppose that the lattice is the square lattice , the triangular lattice or the hexagonal lattice ) .",
    "recall that there exists a lattice - dependent constant @xmath444 such that the number of self - avoiding paths of length @xmath271 on @xmath443 that start at the origin behaves like @xmath445 when @xmath146 .",
    "let us now define the discrete measure @xmath446 on the set of self - avoiding loops that one can draw on @xmath447 , that ( for each @xmath271 ) puts a weight @xmath448 to each loop with @xmath271 steps .",
    "@xmath446 converges when @xmath33 to a limiting measure on self - avoiding loops .",
    "if this limiting measure is conformally invariant , then it is easy to see that it must be ( a multiple of ) our measure @xmath2 .",
    "so , if one believes in this conjecture and in conformal invariance in the scaling limit , then the fact that the definition of @xmath2 makes sense on any riemann surface and satisfies restriction in a broad sense should not be surprising .",
    "one may wonder if a further study of the ( conjectural ) limiting measure @xmath2 might be of some help to understand the conjecture better .",
    "this is what motivates the next subsection",
    ".      it would be nice to be able to have an explicit expression for the mass of the set of loops that go around an annulus in terms of its modulus ( i.e. the explicit expression of @xmath384 ) .",
    "this does not seem easy .",
    "we are now going to study the asymptotics of @xmath384 when @xmath449 .",
    "for some constant @xmath450 , @xmath451 when @xmath449 .    in other words ,",
    "if one considers a very thin tube of width @xmath230 around a very long smooth curve of length @xmath35 , the mass of the set of loops that go around the tube decays exponentially in @xmath35 .",
    "this is of course reminiscent of the fact that for the discrete grid - model @xmath452 , the mass decays exponentially in the number of steps .",
    "as we shall see , the exponent @xmath453 is very closely related to the @xmath454 exponent for sle@xmath41 as derived in @xcite .    before proving this fact ,",
    "let us first concentrate on the corresponding result for the bubble measure . for convenience , we will first use the unit disc rather than the upper half - plane . define @xmath455 ( up to a multiplicative constant ) as the limit as @xmath193 of @xmath456 times",

    "let us briefly recall how it goes in the present case of the unit disc .",
    "first , for each @xmath130 , we define the brownian excursion measure @xmath461 at @xmath414 in @xmath88 as the limit when @xmath33 of @xmath462 , where @xmath463 denotes the law of a brownian motion started from @xmath25 and stopped at its first exit of @xmath88 . then , define the excursion measure @xmath464 .",
    "this is an infinite measure , supported on the set of brownian paths in @xmath88 that start and end on @xmath416 ( each excursion has a starting point and an endpoint ) .",
    "it has been first defined in @xcite and for instance used in @xcite .",
    "it possesses strong conformal invariance properties ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "then ( see @xcite ) , for this well - chosen definition of @xmath8 , the curve @xmath283 is exactly an sle@xmath41 from @xmath465 to @xmath466 .    in the case where @xmath472 and @xmath473 and @xmath470 is the `` long arc '' @xmath474 \\}$ ] ,",

    "the @xmath461 mass of the set of excursions that hit @xmath458 is equal to @xmath476 ( just because @xmath477 is harmonic for a planar brownian motion @xmath101 ) .",
    "hence , the @xmath478-mass of the set of excursions that hit @xmath479 is equal to @xmath480",
    ". also , the @xmath478-mass of the set of excursions that hit @xmath475 and has their starting point ( resp . end point ) in @xmath470 is @xmath481 .",
    "hence , the @xmath478-mass of the set of excursions that hit @xmath458 and have both their endpoints in @xmath470 is greater than @xmath482 .",
    "it follows that the probability @xmath483 that none of the excursions used to construct the sle from @xmath465 to @xmath466 in @xmath88 does hit @xmath475 satisfies @xmath484 ( recall that for a poissonian sample of intensity measure @xmath485 , the probability that in the poissonian sample , no item belongs to the set @xmath44 is @xmath486 ) .",
    "we say that an excursion in the annulus @xmath487 goes the easy way if it disconnects @xmath230 from @xmath458 in @xmath88 .",
    "otherwise , we say that it goes the `` hard way '' .",
    "when no excursions intersect the disc @xmath475 , then the sle itself does not intersect the smaller disc either .",
    "it then remains to estimate the ( conditional ) probability that the sle goes `` the hard way '' ( i.e. `` around @xmath458 '' ) .",
    "this means exactly that none of the two following events happens :    * there exists a brownian excursion that goes the easy way .",
    "* there exists two brownian excursions that do not go the easy way , such that their union disconnects @xmath230 from @xmath488 in @xmath88 .",
    "we know already that this conditional probability decays like @xmath489 when @xmath459 is fixed and @xmath193 , for some positive @xmath490 because of the convergence of the renormalized sle measure to the bubble measure ( i.e. @xmath491 is the mass for the bubble measure of the set of bubbles that go around @xmath458 ) .    on the other hand , it is easy to note that because of scaling , when @xmath193 , the probabilities of this event for @xmath492 and the event for @xmath493 become very close ( for instance by comparing this event with the event in the strip @xmath494)$ ] ) .",
    "hence , we get that @xmath495 .",
    "we have now proved that for some constants @xmath496 , @xmath497 when @xmath449 .",
    "in fact , it is possible to identify what the constant @xmath498 is because we know that the chordal restriction exponent of sle@xmath41 is @xmath454 ( see @xcite ) . in particular",
    ", this enables for instance to estimate the probability that an sle from @xmath499 to @xmath230 in the unit disc stays in @xmath500)$ ] and the leading order term when @xmath449 can be interpreted in terms of brownian excursions in @xmath88 .",
    "the upshot is that @xmath501 . intuitively , going around the annulus is at first order like crossing the rectangle @xmath502 \\times [ 0 , \\rho]$ ] . by scaling ,",
    "this is like crossing the rectangle @xmath503 \\times [ 0 , \\pi]$ ] , and for an sle@xmath41 , this has probability of order @xmath504 .    *",
    "proof of the proposition .",
    "* it now remains to deduce the result for the loop measure @xmath2 from the result on bubbles .",
    "for this , we are going to use the decomposition of @xmath2 along a loewner chain .",
    "suppose that @xmath505 \\to \\overline { { \\hbox { \\m u}}}$ ] now denotes a continuous simple path in the unit disc @xmath88 , started from @xmath506 .",
    "we asume that it is parametrized from `` capacity '' at the origin as radial loewner chains usually are i.e. that if we define the conformal maps @xmath284 from @xmath507 $ ] onto @xmath88 such that @xmath508 and @xmath509 , then @xmath510 .",
    "in fact , we may want to think of @xmath511 as a spiral that winds very fast around the origin ( say a time - reparametrization of @xmath512 for a very small @xmath191 ) .",
    "then , for small @xmath191 , the domain @xmath116 is ( conformally speaking ) very close to the disc @xmath513 .",
    "the function @xmath514 can be viewed as the @xmath515-measure of the set of bubbles that go around the disc @xmath516 , where @xmath515 is `` the bubble measure in the unit disc '' , started at the boundary point @xmath230 .",
    "exactly as in the case of the upper - half plane , one can prove that @xmath517 }   = \\int_0^t dt \\varphi_t^{-1 } \\circ bubb .\\ ] ] hence , it follows that @xmath518 \\not= \\emptyset \\hbox { and } \\gamma \\hbox { surrounds } e^{-\\rho } { { \\hbox { \\m u } } } )    = \\int_0^t f ( r(t ) ) dt\\ ] ] where @xmath519 \\cup e^{-\\rho } { { \\hbox { \\m u } } } ) ) $ ] .",
    "if we take @xmath520 , and @xmath521 as before , and then let @xmath193 , we get immediately that @xmath522 in particular , when @xmath449 , @xmath523",
    "we are going to conclude this paper by briefly mentioning in a more informal style the direct relation between @xmath2 and the measures on outer perimeters of critical percolation clusters in their scaling limit .",
    "this will show that , as in the case of brownian loops , the inside perimeters and the outside perimeters of critical percolation clusters have the same `` law '' , and also that outside perimeters are invariant ( in law ) with respect to perturbations of the complex structure `` inside '' .",
    "let us consider critical percolation on the triangular lattice in the entire plane ( we restrict ourselves to this lattice since it is at present the only one for which conformal invariance is proved ) .",
    "we can view it as a random coloring of the faces of a hexagonal grid , where each face is colored independently in black or white with probability @xmath524 .",
    "one way to encode the obtained configuration is to define the family of loops on the hexagonal grid that separate white connected components and black connected components .",
    "these are the interfaces for this model .",
    "each of the loops is self - avoiding on the scale of the lattice and the family of all loops describes fully the percolation configuration .        for convenience ,",
    "we are going to introduce a small @xmath10 , and look at the percolation configuration on a grid of mesh - size @xmath10 ( we shall then let @xmath33 ) .",
    "it is easy to see using the russo - seymour - welsh theory that for any bounded domain @xmath3 and any @xmath525 , the mean number of loops included in @xmath3 and of diameter greater than @xmath191 remains bounded and bounded away from @xmath12 ( except of course if @xmath191 is greater than the diameter of @xmath3 ... ) as @xmath33 .",
    "furthermore , it is also easy to see that the loops will `` not remain self - avoiding '' on the large scale , i.e. , that on a large loop , one can find neighboring sites @xmath229 and @xmath526 on the hexagonal lattice of mesh - size @xmath10 and on the same loop such that the loop goes ( twice ) to a macroscopic distance between its visits of @xmath229 and @xmath526 .",
    "smirnov @xcite proved that in the scaling limit crossing probabilities of conformal rectangles for this percolation model converge to a ( conformally invariant ) limit predicted by cardy @xcite when @xmath10 goes to zero .",
    "camia and newman @xcite showed that , using smirnov s result , how one can indeed deduce convergence when @xmath33 of the joint law of all the discrete loops , towards a continuous family of loops , that are also described in terms of the sle@xmath527 processes that had been studied in @xcite .",
    "this continuous family of loops in some sense describe the joint law of the clusters in the scaling limit .",
    "in particular , one loop out of two is the outer boundary of a white cluster , the other ones being `` inside boundaries '' of white clusters .",
    "let us call @xmath528 these outer boundaries .",
    "these continuous loops are not self - avoiding ( in fact , they have many double points : the dimension of each loop is a.s . @xmath529 while the dimension of their `` boundaries '' is @xmath28 , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "let us call @xmath530 the self - avoiding loop obtained by taking the `` outer boundary '' ( i.e. the boundary of the unbounded connected component of the complement ) of @xmath531 .",
    "the conformal invariance statement can then be phrased as follows :    for each simply connected domain @xmath3 , define the law joint law @xmath532 of the set of loops @xmath533 that do stay in @xmath3 . then , if @xmath5 is a conformal map from @xmath3 onto another simply connected domain @xmath80 , then the law of @xmath534 is identical to @xmath535 .",
    "clearly , this implies also the same statement for the outer boundaries @xmath530 instead of the boundaries @xmath531 .",
    "hence , the probability measures @xmath532 satisfy a type of conformal restriction property .",
    "in fact , if we now define for each measurable set @xmath44 of self - avoiding loops @xmath536 then @xmath537 is a measure on the set of self - avoiding loops in the plane , that does satisfy conformal restriction .",
    "hence , it is equal to a constant times the measure @xmath2 that we have defined in this paper . in other words ,",
    "the measure @xmath2 can also be constructed as the outer boundary of the scaling limits of percolation cluster boundaries .",
    "the multiplicative constant @xmath8 does here not seem to be easy to determine .",
    "note that in fact , as we are focusing only on these outer boundaries @xmath530 , we do not really need the convergence of the full discrete loops to the full loops @xmath531 .",
    "indeed , it is not very hard using some a priori estimates for percolation ( i.e. the 5-arm estimate ) to see that the @xmath530 s are the limits when @xmath538 of the discrete outer perimeters of percolation clusters , where the outer perimeter of a cluster is the outer boundary of the domain obtained by `` filling in all fjords of width one '' .",
    "more precisely , consider the unbounded connected component of the complement of a cluster .",
    "we then just keep the subdomain of this component consisting of points @xmath229 such that there exist two disjoint paths from @xmath229 to infinity that avoid the cluster .",
    "the boundary of this subdomain is the discrete outer perimeter ( these discrete curves had been studied and simulated by physicists before , see e.g. @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "then , the law of the joint family of discrete outer perimeters @xmath539 converges when @xmath33 to that of @xmath540 , so that for some constant @xmath8 and any ( reasonable ) set of ( macroscopic but bounded ) loops ( for instance the set of loops that go around the hole in a given conformal annulus ) , @xmath541 the shape of a percolation cluster outer perimeter has therefore exactly the same law as that of the outer boundary of a brownian loop .",
    "note again that the proof of this result relies solely on the conformal invariance of both models and on their restriction property .",
    "the definition of the discrete outer perimeter is very non - symmetric , and it is non - local in the discrete case : because of the `` closure of fjords procedure '' , it does not suffice to look at the status of the hexagons that touch a given self - avoiding loop to decide if it is an outer perimeter .",
    "one needs to make sure that the `` fjords do not meet in the inside '' .",
    "hence , the inside / outside symmetry statement for @xmath2 is not obvious at all from this perspective either ( and this statement is based on sle considerations ) .",
    "in fact , it has rather surprising consequences , just as for the brownian loop approach .",
    "it says that outer perimeters of percolation are ( in law ) not affected by change of the conformal structure in their inside .    as for the brownian measure @xmath209 in corollary [ c15 ]",
    ", one can also characterize @xmath2 in terms of all perimeters ( not only the outer ones ) and this changes the constant @xmath8 by a factor of @xmath417 .",
    "we safely leave this to the reader .",
    "it is not difficult to check that the joint law ( i.e. measure ) of the boundaries for one percolation cluster is not the same as the joint law ( i.e. measure ) of the boundaries for one brownian loop .",
    "for instance , the existence of cut - points for brownian motions shows that in a brownian loop , there exist inner boundaries that intersect the outer boundary , and that the dimension of these intersection points is a.s .",
    "3/4 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "for the scaling limit of percolation clusters , this is not the case ( it would correspond to a `` 6 arms '' exponent  recall that we are looking at outer boundaries ) .",
    "it is just the shape of `` one prescribed '' boundary that coincide for percolation clusters and for brownian loops .",
    "finally , note that in the case of riemann surfaces of higher genus , the cut - point issue raised in the brownian loop case ( i.e. the fact that the outer boundary can have double points ) does not occur in the case of outer boundaries of percolation clusters , because the perimeters sides have a definite `` color '' ."
