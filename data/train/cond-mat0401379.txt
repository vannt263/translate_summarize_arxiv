    "the quest for the correct equations of motion describing a system is an essential task of each problem in all branches of physics .",
    "the procedure is well - known for mechanical systems , where for example the appropriate lagrangian has to be found , from which the ( newtonian ) equations of motion can be derived using variational principles .",
    "this method can in particular be applied to continuum mechanics , generating the usual bulk equations and boundary conditions .    however , for more complicated dissipative systems , these straightforward and general methods are usually not applicable .",
    "bulk diffusion , friction , and also irreversible phase transitions are important examples . in the framework of linear nonequilibrium thermodynamics ,",
    "the `` process velocity '' is proportional to the deviation of an energy functional from its equilibrium value .",
    "if we consider for example diffusion processes , then the flux of material is typically @xmath0 with the diffusion coefficient d and a chemical potential @xmath1 .",
    "similarly , for phase transformations at an interface , the resulting interface normal velocity is assumed to be proportional to the difference in chemical potentials in both phases , @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is a kinetic coefficient ) ; obviously , in both cases the chemical potential @xmath1 is the relevant driving force for this type of dynamics ; however , it is not evident how it can be expressed through the state variables of the system .",
    "therefore it is desirable to provide a method to derive the correct expression for the chemical potential using first principle techniques .",
    "for relatively simple processes , it is easy to guess it correctly , but as soon as more complicated effects are included , the results are sometimes unexpected .",
    "a particular example are elastodynamic effects , and the correct expression for the chemical potential will be derived in this paper .",
    "the influence of surface tension , also causing complicated contributions to the chemical potential , was already considered for processes at elastically stressed surfaces in @xcite ; however , the author made some systematic mistakes .",
    "this illustrates that the lack of a consistent derivation and the use of bare intuition can easily lead to wrong predictions . though the aim of the current paper is mainly to demonstrate methodological aspects how to derive consistently these expressions from variational principles , we also want to point out that the results form a basis to the understanding of important topics like solidification of superfluid helium @xcite and fracture mechanics @xcite .",
    "the asaro - tiller - grinfeld ( atg ) instability is a particular example of these processes @xcite .",
    "here one considers a solid piece of material which is either in contact with its melt such that phase transitions and thus motion of the interface are possible , or which suffers from surface diffusion . a uniaxial stress at the surface of this solid gives rise to a morphological instability ; long wave deformations lead to a reduction of the total energy .",
    "a relaxation of elastic stresses in some regions makes them more favorable in comparison to the valleys in which the stress is increased ; consequently , a corrugated surface is characterized by a modulation of the elastic energy density at the surface .",
    "this contribution favors a destabilization of the interface , counteracted by the surface energy which prefers a flat surface .",
    "after the initial development , the originally slow process becomes extremely fast and leads to an unphysical breakdown of the analytical and numerical predictions : deep groves with sharp tips advancing with increasing velocity can form in the sample @xcite . here",
    "strong surface tension and also dynamical effects become relevant , but they are not taken into account in conventional descriptions .",
    "the main problem is here that it is not obvious how these effects enter into the expression of the chemical potential .",
    "the main goal of the current paper is therefore to provide a method to derive all describing quantities in a consistent way from variational principles .",
    "a particular illustration is the grinfeld instability with surface tension .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ lagrangian ] we present the lagrangian which is used to derive all further physical laws . in particular , we consider a linear elastic medium with dynamical effects , surface tension and surface energy , under the influence of external forces . in section [ elastodynamics ]",
    "we derive the basic equations of motion and boundary conditions for the `` mechanical '' degrees of freedom , the elastic displacements , from the lagrangian . in section [ chempot ] the expression for the chemical potential at the surface of a solid body is derived using variational principles .",
    "the surface tension enters into the final expression in a complicated way , and also inertial effects appear unexpectedly .",
    "therefore , in section [ dissipation ] the rate of change of the total energy during a reshuffling of the surface is calculated ; this confirms the preceding results for the chemical potential .",
    "a specific application of these general techniques is the grinfeld instability with surface tension ( section [ grinfeld ] ) .",
    "we derive the spectrum of the initial stage of this instability .",
    "additionally , in section [ grilhe ] the energetic change during the morphological transformations is calculated , correcting inconsistencies in @xcite .",
    "appendix [ conservation ] explains the fundamental conservation laws for momentum and angular momentum for elastic systems with surface tension ; appendix [ deriv ] contains the mathematical details to express the dissipation rate and the functional derivative for a generic functional which is used to derive the chemical potential and the energy dissipation .",
    "we consider a solid body in vacuum under the influence of external forces , linear elastodynamics , surface energy and tension .",
    "the lagrangian is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the time - dependent volume of the elastic body and @xmath6 its boundary with elements @xmath7 .",
    "the expressions for kinetic and potential energy densities are @xmath8 here @xmath9 denotes the mass density , which we assume to be constant .",
    "therefore we neglect compressive effects , since @xmath10 .",
    "the elastic displacement field is denoted by @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the stress and @xmath13 the strain tensor , @xmath14 is the surface energy density and @xmath15 the surface tension coefficient .",
    "the representation of the surface tension contribution is unusual , and we will further comment on it below @xcite .",
    "the stresses @xmath16 are the given external forces which may act on some parts of the boundary ; everywhere else they are zero .",
    "we assume the volume to be two - dimensional ; @xmath17 is the tangential and @xmath18 the normal direction at the interface .    the surface _ energy _ in eq .",
    "( [ lag::eq4 ] ) expresses the energy of the original undeformed surface , whereas the surface _",
    "contribution gives the additional energy which arises from elongation of the surface due to elastic effects .",
    "notice that @xmath19 is the elongation or compression of the length element @xmath7 .",
    "surface energy gives only an additional contribution to the total energy , surface tension also couples to the elastic fields and changes the elastic boundary conditions , as will be seen in the next section .",
    "also , in section [ grilhe ] , it will be shown how the surface tension can be interpreted in a more intuitive way , by relating it to surface forces which are proportional to the local curvature of the boundary .",
    "in general , both coefficients @xmath14 and @xmath15 are of the same order of magnitude , and for a liquid they can be shown to be identical @xcite ; in general , @xmath15 can even be negative . for three - dimensional situations , the surface tension contribution in eq .",
    "( [ lag::eq4 ] ) reads in general @xmath20 with the summation of @xmath21 being restricted to the two tangential directions of the surface . in the case of surfaces with a symmetry axis",
    "higher than twofold , the surface tension tensor is diagonal , @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "stress and strain are connected by hooke s law . for simplicity",
    ", we restrict it to the isotropic case , @xmath23 with @xmath24 being the elastic modulus and @xmath25 the poisson ratio . the inverse transformation is @xmath26.\\ ] ] the action is given by the time integral @xmath27 with arbitrary initial and end times @xmath28 .",
    "since the lagrangian is translational and rotational invariant in the absence of external forces , total momentum and angular momentum are conserved .",
    "this property is not obvious if nonequilibrium processes at the surface locally change the amount of material ; a further discussion is given in appendix [ conservation ] .",
    "the euler - lagrange conditions demand that the variation of the action with respect to the displacements has to vanish @xcite . here",
    "we also take into account that the volume can change in time due to other processes .",
    "we obtain for the bulk contribution @xmath29 now we examine the first term @xmath30 in more detail .",
    "we start from the expression @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the normal velocity of the interface ; it is positive if the solid extends .",
    "we point out that the elastic velocity @xmath33 at the surface and @xmath32 are different quantities : the latter one describes the morphological changes of the shape due to nonelastic effects , for example by surface diffusion or the growth of a solid body from its undercooled melt . on the other hand",
    ", the normal displacement rate @xmath33 does not contribute to @xmath32 , since in the framework of the linear theory of elasticity one does not distinguish between the undeformed and deformed frame of reference . therefore we obtain @xmath34 the first bulk integral does not contribute since we have to demand that all variations disappear at @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "consequently , we obtain the variation of the bulk action @xmath37 \\delta u_i\\ , dv \\\\ & - & \\int\\limits_{\\partial v(t ) } [ \\sigma_{ni } + v_n \\rho \\dot{u}_i ] \\delta u_i\\ , d\\tau \\bigg\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we define the curvature of the surface to be negative for a convex body .",
    "the tangential strain is @xmath38 here , the definitions of the partial and the total tangential derivative are @xmath39 thus we get for the variation of the boundary action @xmath40 since the term containing @xmath41 can be integrated along the boundary and does not contribute . vanishing total variation , @xmath42 ,",
    "requires therefore @xmath43 these are the known elastodynamic equations , together with the boundary conditions , now also considering surface tension .",
    "the velocity dependent term in the boundary conditions ensures momentum conservation .",
    "notice that we had chosen for simplicity the particular case of a solid body inside the vacuum , and not for example in contact with a liquid or different solid phase .",
    "however , the calculations can easily be extended to these slightly more complicated case ; then in eqs .",
    "( [ mech::eq3 ] ) and ( [ mech::eq4 ] ) the difference @xmath44 $ ] between the values in the two phases appears instead @xcite .",
    "in the previous section the dynamics of the mechanical variables , the elastic displacements , was studied , requiring that the variation of @xmath45 with respect to @xmath46 vanishes .",
    "the elastic body was already considered as moving or transforming , which leads to the appearance of the interface normal velocity in the elastic boundary conditions .",
    "the reason for this surface rearrangement is not yet specified and is not of mechanical origin .",
    "a specific example would be surface diffusion .",
    "the elastic motion as `` mechanical '' process describes the motion of individual atoms due to newton s law ; in contrast , the `` chemical '' processes are related to a ( local ) change of the number of atoms and consequently of the shape of the body .",
    "demanding that the solid body is in equilibrium not only with respect to variations of the displacement vector but also with respect to this new degree of freedom , the interface position , leads to the requirement that @xmath47 holds also for variations of the surface position in normal direction by an interface shift @xmath48 .",
    "otherwise , small deviations from the condition @xmath47 initiate thermodynamical processes , driven by the chemical potential @xmath49 from the bulk lagrangian we gain @xmath50 notice that this expression contains in particular the _ difference _ between potential and kinetic bulk energy .",
    "a naive guess would be that the chemical potential is the total energy density , containing thus the _ sum _ of both contributions .",
    "however , the above explanation shows that this is not true . a further discussion on this point is given in the next section .",
    "for the boundary contribution we assume here that the surface of consideration is free of external tractions .",
    "then we get from eq .",
    "( [ deriv::eq1 ] ) @xmath51\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we used the rotation rule @xmath52 and the expression for the total derivative @xmath53 therefore the total chemical potential , @xmath54 , reads @xmath55 .",
    "\\label{chem::eq6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] obviously , one immediately reproduces the known elastostatic case with surface energy , without inertial and surface tension effects @xcite ; notice that the chemical potential is then nothing else than the energy density at the surface .",
    "inertial effects enter in an unexpected way , because instead of the _ sum _ of elastic and kinetic energy density their _ difference _ appears here .",
    "surface tension gives rise to three contributions : at first , the term @xmath56 reflects the change of the strain @xmath57 when the solid extends in normal direction , and @xmath58 expresses the elongation of a curved surface element . without dynamical effects and external forces , the last term in the surface tension contribution vanishes , because , by virtue of the boundary condition ( [ mech::eq4 ] ) and hooke s law , also @xmath59 .",
    "this full derivative appears only if both inertial contributions and surface tension are taken into account , leading to a coupling of both effects .",
    "an alternative approach to derive the expression for the chemical potential is to express the dissipation of energy due to morphological changes of the solid phase in terms of boundary integrals .",
    "then the chemical potential gives the amount of energy change at the traction free surfaces ( per atom ) if the shape of the solid is altered .",
    "it consists basically of three contributions : a change of the stressed volume reduces or increases the energy by the density @xmath60 ; also , a change of the shape modifies the boundary conditions and leads to an additional energy contribution @xmath61 .",
    "finally , complicated `` boundary '' terms arising from surface tension and energy appear .    to calculate the dissipation rate , we start with the bulk contribution , @xmath62 then we obtain @xmath63 the boundary energy is @xmath64 and its dissipation rate according to eq .",

    "we are mainly interested in local deformations of traction free surfaces ( @xmath72 ) , leading to an alternative definition of the chemical potential , @xmath73 with the same expression ( [ chem::eq6 ] ) .",
    "in particular , we clearly see that the density of the bulk _ lagrangian _ instead of the total _ energy _ is relevant for the dynamics .",
    "a straightforward application of the preceding results is the grinfeld instability @xcite ; similar to @xcite we also include surface tension here and neglect inertial effects .",
    "usually , the dynamics of this instability , either driven by evaporation and condensation or by surface diffusion , is slow , and therefore kinetic terms need not be considered here .",
    "this is at least valid in the initial stage of the instability , but has to be corrected in the late regime when this omission leads to unphysical finite time singularities @xcite .",

    "we point out that the elastic constants appear only in the combination @xmath115 , since the scenario described here is plane strain .    at a first glance ,",
    "the description of the grinfeld instability using the chemical potential and the energy calculation seem to differ in a very important sense : the chemical potential is first order in the perturbation amplitude @xmath88 ; in particular , it is sufficient to calculate all elastic fields only up to first order .",
    "the use of energetic arguments always requires the calculation of second order terms . in principle",
    ", it needs the elastic fields also up to second order , because for example in the bulk energy , also terms like @xmath116 appear .",
    "this seems to contradict the former results using the chemical potential , which should contain the same physical information .",
    "in fact , it turns out that the second order terms in the elastic fields do not enter into the final energy terms ; in other words , the same results can be obtained , setting @xmath117 in the airy function above .",
    "the explanation is now rather simple for the surface tension integral : in the first representation ( [ energy::eq1 ] ) , it seems that @xmath57 has to be evaluated up to second order . in the second representation ( [ energy::eq2 ] ) , assuming that the first term vanishes , the curvature is already of first order in @xmath88 , and hence only the first order of @xmath118 is required . for the elastic bulk energy it is known that in the present case of linear elasticity there is no interaction between the stress caused by externally applied forces and internal locked - in stress by surface tension @xcite , and therefore only first order terms are needed here .",
    "similar calculations of the total energy of a wavy surface were done in @xcite . however , the displacement fields without surface tension , as expressed by eq .",
    "( 5 ) there , are incorrect ; the correct expressions can in principle easily be obtained from the airy function ( [ airy ] ) . in particular",

    "the corner contributions in eq .",
    "( [ energy::eq2 ] ) have to be taken into account .",
