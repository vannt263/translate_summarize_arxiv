    "free - standing films of several smectic - a liquid - crystalline compounds can be heated above the bulk smectic disordering temperature without immediately rupturing , and instead are found to undergo successive layer - by - layer thinning transitions as the temperature is increased @xcite .",
    "the persistence of smectic layering in an overheated thin film is usually attributed to enhanced ordering associated with the free surfaces of the film , as is known to occur in other contexts @xcite .",
    "there is not yet , however , a clear consensus on the mechanisms by which layer thinning occurs . according to one set of theories @xcite",
    ", thinning takes place when the smectic layer structure in the middle of a film vanishes . in an alternative theory @xcite , supported by experimental studies @xcite ,",
    "layer thinning occurs by spontaneous nucleation of dislocation loops prior to the melting of the layer structure in the film interior .",
    "this mechanism is not necessarily unrelated to the former , since a sufficient reduction in the degree of interior smectic ordering is required for it to proceed .",
    "one of the key experimental observables is the variation of layer - thinning transition temperatures @xmath0 with the number of film layers @xmath1 , which is found to be well fit by the power - law relation @xmath2 , where @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is close to the bulk transition temperature .",
    "alternative mathematical relations @xcite and an upper bound @xcite for @xmath0 have been derived from the different theories . with appropriate fitting parameters ,",
    "these alternative relations all turn out to agree well with the power - law expression and , thus , are not able to distinguish between the various mechanisms .    in this paper , we examine further the connections between the different proposed mechanisms of layer - thinning transitions . as in several recent works @xcite ,",
    "our analysis is based on de gennes @xcite phenomenological landau theory for a `` presmectic '' film of a fluid exhibiting a _ second - order _ bulk a - nematic ( n ) transition .",
    "more precisely , we employ a generalization of that theory recently proposed by the present authors @xcite .",
    "one drawback of de gennes original model stems from attributing surface - enhanced smectic ordering to an external - field - like coupling term of constant magnitude , which is more appropriate for a film confined between solid walls .",
    "this has the consequence that a weak degree of smectic ordering in a thin film is predicted to persist up to arbitrarily high temperatures . in order to induce layer thinning ,",
    "recent studies based on this theory have included the effects of a pressure difference @xmath6 associated with curvature of the meniscus at the film border @xcite . according to the latter studies ,",
    "@xmath7 must be of a sufficient magnitude to cause layer thinning , although the layer - thinning transition temperatures are found to depend only logarithmically on @xmath6 .",
    "the modified version of de gennes theory proposed by the present authors @xcite utilizes a different form of the surface contribution to the free energy ( suggested by older theories of wetting @xcite ) , which is quadratic rather than linear in the surface order parameter and which restores smectic melting at high temperatures without requiring the pressure term .    according to the theory of ref.@xcite , reviewed here in sec .",
    "[ sec : non_unif ] , the free energy per area of an overheated smectic film exhibits a discrete sequence of metastable local minima , whose depths decrease with increasing number of layers up to some finite maximum @xmath8 depending on temperature . at or slightly below the temperature for which the free - energy well at @xmath8 vanishes , it was assumed in ref.@xcite that the film would spontaneously thin down to a smaller thickness .",

    ", we investigate the nucleation of dislocation loops between film domains of different thicknesses and the subsequent growth of the thinner region of the film , which is contrasted with the `` uniform - thinning '' mechanism for the film to achieve a state of lower free energy .",
    "the results are mapped onto the conventional nucleation picture , in which the activation free - energy barrier to nucleation depends on both the difference in well - depths of the homogeneous film regions and the line tension @xmath9 of the dislocation loop . here",
    "we calculate the line tension @xmath9 , activation energy , and velocity of a growing loop self - consistently in the dynamical model , and evaluate their dependence on temperature and number of layers .",
    "it is found that thinning via nucleation of dislocation loops preempts the uniform - thinning mechanism provided the pressure difference @xmath6 due to the meniscus is sufficiently large .",
