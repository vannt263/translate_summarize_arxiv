    "there are three possible explanations for the origin of the rapid rotation of be stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : ( 1 ) they were born as rapid rotators ; ( 2 ) along the main - sequence ( ms ) evolution , single stars with a sufficiently high rotational velocity on the zero - age main - sequence ( zams ) can reach equatorial velocities near the critical value , due to the transfer of angular momentum from the inner contracting part to the outer region @xcite ; and ( 3 ) they are the mass gainers that were spun up by a past episode of roche - lobe overflow ( rlof ) in an interacting binary @xcite . during the process of rlof ,",
    "matter and angular momentum are transferred from the primary star to the secondary star , spinning up the latter to very high rotation rates @xcite , which then turns into a be star . according to @xcite ,",
    "about 75% of the detected be stars may have been spun - up by binary mass transfer , while most of the remaining be stars were likely rapid rotators at birth .",
    "@xcite showed that most young b type stars have rotational velocities that are well below the limit for be star formation , suggesting that only a small fraction of be stars were born as rapid rotators . using a binary population synthesis ( bps ) method , @xcite investigated the formation of be stars by case b mass transfer , and presented a comparison between the predicted number of be stars and observations .",
    "they concluded that no more than 60% of the population of be stars can be produced by close binary interaction .",
    "@xcite also attempted to address the observed lower mass limit of @xmath10 for the be stars in bexrbs , corresponding to the spectral type b2 .",
    "they suggested that only systems with initial mass ratios ( i.e. , the ratio of the secondary mass and the primary mass ) larger than @xmath11 can produce be stars .",
    "the argument was that systems with smaller initial mass ratios do not transfer any mass stably but evolve into a spiral - in common envelope ( ce ) phase , without forming be stars .",
    "thus be stars with spectral type later than b2 can be effectively removed . in the calculations",
    ", they adopted a simple assumption that the supernova ( sn ) explosion of the primary is spherically symmetric , which helps the survival of the binary after the sn .",
    "@xcite considered the effect of an asymmetric sn explosion and used a constant value for the kick velocity .",
    "although the number of late - type be stars with a ns companion is reduced slightly , the spectral distribution of the be stars was found not to match the observations .",
    "the author then introduced possible mass loss from the binary system at the second lagrangian point @xmath12 during the mass transfer processes , with the escaped matter taking away @xmath13 times the specific angular momentum of the binary system .",
    "because of the high rate of angular momentum loss , the systems with small initial mass ratios would also undergo spiral - in and evolve towards a ce phase . therefore be stars with a ns companion",
    "should be more massive than @xmath14 .",
    "@xcite also made population synthesis calculation on the formation of be stars via binary evolution in the galaxy and the magellanic clouds , incorporating updated data of the sn kick .",
    "they assumed that a minimal initial mass ratio @xmath15 for stable mass transfer , below which ce evolution will occur .",
    "consequently the be stars evovled from close binary evolution were shown to contribute not too much to the total population of be stars ( less than 20% and possibly even as low as 5% ) .",
    "a more recent bps study of galactic bexrbs was performed by @xcite , who attempted to explain the problem of the missing bexrbs with bhs at that time .",
    "however , the discovery of mwc 656 suggests that the population of be / bh binaries are not negligible in the galaxy .    as mentioned above",
    ", the critical mass ratio @xmath0 , which is used to determine whether a binary system experiences stable mass transfer , is one of the vital factors in the formation of the be stars through binary interaction .",

    "alternatively , @xcite suggested that a star can continue to accrete even with the critical rotation , based on the argument of @xcite and @xcite that the accretion disk can regulate the mass and angular momentum flux through viscous coupling .    in summary , mass accretion can spin up the accretor , cause it to expand , and probably result in mass loss .",

    "the basic idea is that the related effective angular momentum loss can promote the binary to evolve into a ce stage , and only binaries with @xmath137 can survive . in our approach , we have taken into account both the mass transfer stability and the possible effect of mass loss under different conditions .",
    "we find that only in channel 1 of model ii , the calculated mass distribution of be stars is in line with observations , but for be / ns binaries formed from channel 2 of the same model , the distributions of both @xmath138 and @xmath133 disagree with the observation is affected by the rather uncertain mass determination of be stars , as well as by possible incompleteness of the observed sample of bexrbs . ] .",
    "we will address this issue below .",
    "@xcite found that the lowest velocity that a star has to reach to show the be - effect may vary as a function of the stellar mass .",
    "low - mass ( @xmath139 ) b stars need to rotate extremely fast ( @xmath140 , where @xmath141 is the rotational velocity at the equatorial plane ) to create an outflowing disk , while for massive stars ( @xmath142 ) , the threshold drops to @xmath143 . in fig .",
    "4 we plot the number distributions of be / ns systems in model ii as a function of @xmath144 , with the black and red curves corresponding to the threshold value of @xmath145 and 0.95 , respectively . we find that , with a higher @xmath146 , the number of low- and intermediate - mass be stars can be reduced slightly , but there are still too many such be / ns binaries .",
    "the reason is that a star can be spun up to critical rotation by accreting about @xmath147 of its original mass @xcite , and this can be practically satisfied by most post - ce mass transfer .",
    "here we propose two possible ways to remove intermediate - mass be stars in be / ns systems .",
    "( 1 ) to form a be star , there should be enough mass accreted by the secondary star with @xmath148 .",
    "when calculating the stellar rotation , we assumed that the star is rigidly rotating , while differential rotation may be more realistic .",
    "in addition , when the accretor spins up to close to the critical limit , it may lose mass due to the effect of the centrifugal force @xcite .",
    "thus more accreted mass is needed to turn a b type star into a be star .",
    "the accreted mass during the post - ce mass transfer process is relatively small with @xmath120 always @xmath149 .",
    "if this threshold works , then low- and intermediate - mass be stars would not be produced in this channel .",
    "( 2 ) the effect of magnetic braking combining strong magnetic field ( as in bp stars ) and the enhanced wind could spin down the stars .",
    "this model was established by @xcite and @xcite for the spin angular momentum evolution of the accretors in algol - type binary stars .",
    "a differentially rotating star might generate magnetic fields in its radiative atmospheres .",
    "the processes of accretion may also induce strong winds which interacts with the magnetic field ( @xmath150 1 kg ) .",
    "due to magnetic braking , the rotational velocity of the accretor may be reduced to below its critical limit and lose the character of a be star .",
    "the problem with this explanation is that no magnetic field has been reliably detected in any be star @xcite .",
    "based on the above arguments we do not favor the formation of be / ns binaries through the post - ce mass transfer . in the following we only discuss the",
    "be stars formed through channel 1 .",
    "as the mass distribution of be stars in be / ns binaries can fit the observation better in model ii , we regard it as the standard model and discuss the results in this model in the following , if not mentioned otherwise .",
    "however , we note that the assumption of 50% accretion efficiency in model ii is completely ad hoc , and models i and iii are actually more physical , considering the roles of rotation and thermal equilibrium of the accretor to constrain the accretion processes .",
    "the fact that model ii can better reproduce the bexrb population indicates that some important physics is still lacking in the treatment of the binary evolution .",
    "meanwhile , the obtained results also depend on the adopted ways of mass loss .",
    "all the three models assume isotropic re - emission of the material that is not accreted .",
    "figure  5 displays the expected distribution of be / ns binaries in the @xmath151 plane .",
    "in the left and right panels we plot the binaries with the nss originating from electron - capture sne and core - collapse sne , respectively . during core - collapse sne",
    "the newborn nss experience violent explosions and a high - velocity kick , the resulting binaries tend to have eccentricities @xmath152 . in the case of electron - capture sne , the binary eccentricities @xmath153 .",
    "the eccentricity distribution may provide important information about the two subpopulations of bexrbs resulting from different types of sne ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see however , cheng et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "there is currently only one confirmed be / bh binary in the galaxy , i.e. , mwc 656 @xcite , which contains a bh of mass @xmath154 in a @xmath155 day orbit . from our bps calculations ,",
    "the number of be / bh systems is @xmath156 in the standard model , but increases to @xmath157 in model i. in model iii , no be / bh can be formed , because in the case of stable mass transfer with @xmath158 , the secondary mass has been increased to @xmath159 .",
    "figure 6 shows the distribution of be / bh binaries in the @xmath160 plane , with the left and right panels corresponding to models i and ii , respectively ( the dashed line denotes the orbital period of nwc 656 ) .",
    "the masses of the be stars can be as low as @xmath14 in model i , while in model ii @xmath161 .",
    "@xcite have explored the formation of the populations of be / ns and be / bh binaries , and found the numbers of these two types of systems to be @xmath162 and @xmath163 , respectively .",
    "the numbers of be / bh systems from their calculation are covered by ours .",
    "in particular , the ratio of be binaries with nss to the ones with bhs is @xmath164 ( in models i and ii ) , while the preferred value is @xmath165 in @xcite .",
    "the difference results from different definitions of bexrbs and different treatments on the formation of be stars .",
    "for example , @xcite assumed that a constant fraction of b type stars are be stars , and that all binaries either survive ce evolution or evolves to a merger if the donor star is in the hg .",
    "finally we emphasize that in both @xcite and this work semi - analytic formulae ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are adopted to estimate the bh masses , which are assumed to be largely determined by the progenitor mass should be @xmath166 rather @xmath167 . ] .",
    "however , it has been shown that successful sn explosions are intertwined with failures in a complex pattern that is not well described by the progenitor initial mass and is not simply related to compactness ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "for example , progenitors with certain initial masses less than @xmath168 are likely to form bhs rather nss .",
    "this may remarkably influence the predicted number of bhs and the bh mass functions .",
    "most of the be binaries contain a he star or a wd companion ( see table 1 ) . in figs .  7 and 8 we plot the distributions of be / he and be / wd binaries in the @xmath169 plane , respectively .",
    "the mass distributions of be stars in the be / he and be / wd binaries are shown in fig .  10 with red and green curves , respectively .",
    "our calculations show that a be star can have a he companion with mass @xmath170 . when the he star s mass is less than @xmath171 , the rejuvenated ms lifetime of the be star becomes shorter than that of the he star , and such binaries contribute most to the population of be / he binaries . during the formation of be / compact star binaries",
    ", the primaries also spend some time in the he star stage when their envelopes are stripped , although these he stars are more massive and evolve quickly into compact stars before the be stars evolve off the ms .",
    "the orbital periods of be / he binaries lie between @xmath172 days and @xmath173 days , and cluster around @xmath174 days .",
    "based on the combined energy distribution of a b2v star and a @xmath175 he star companion , @xcite showed that the luminosity of the binary in xuv should be dominated by the he star . at lower frequencies the contribution of the he star is negligible and it is difficult to detect these systems .",
    "the orbital periods of be / wd binaries also range from @xmath176 days to @xmath173 days , and peak around @xmath177 days .",
    "they tend to possess intermediate - mass be stars , similar as be / he binaries .",
    "@xcite found that the peak of the @xmath64 distribution is @xmath178 days and there are very few systems with @xmath179 days .",
    "the differences mainly result from the synchronization mechanisms adopted . in @xcite ,",
    "relatively short - period be / wd binaries are removed from the population due to the operation of the synchronization mechanism of @xcite .",
    "this mechanism is more efficient than that suggested by @xcite adopted in the bse code , so stars with @xmath180 days can be synchronized and lose the be character .",
    "our calculations suggest that there may be @xmath181 be / wd binaries in the galaxy .",
    "it is interesting to note that currently there are no be / wd binaries observed in the galaxy , though three were identified in the large and small magellanic clouds @xcite .",
    "the circumstellar disk of the be star may be truncated by the tidal torque from the wd , because of its circular orbit @xcite , with little accretion onto the wd . in this case",
    "the wd s uv and optical emission powered by cooling could be detected for hottest wds .",
    "if the truncation is inefficient and the wd can accrete matter from the be star disk , it might experience episodes of shell burning ( as in nova systems ) , appearing as a transient supersoft x - ray source .",
    "however , its xuv and soft x - ray radiation is likely to be absorbed by the gas in the envelope of the be star in which the wd is embedded @xcite .",
    "analyses by @xcite and @xcite suggest that small amount of circumstellar matter local to the wd can easily suppress its x - ray emission .",
    "the masses of isolated be stars can be as low as @xmath182 @xcite .",
    "here we consider their formation through binary evolution in two ways .",
    "the first is from `` disrupted be / ns and be / bh systems '' because of the sn explosions .",
    "when the primary star evolves to experience a sn explosion and leaves a ns or bh , the binary system may be disrupted and produce an isolated be star .",
    "be stars originating from disrupted be / ns systems are much more numerous than from be / bh systems ( see table 1 ) , because of the imf and larger amplitude kicks imparted on the nss .",
    "the mass distributions of the calculated ( in the standard model ) and observed isolated be stars are plotted in fig .  9 in the blue and grey solid lines , respectively .",
    "the observational data were taken from @xcite with a magnitude limit of @xmath183 , so many late - type be stars might have been missed due to the selection effect , and the actual distribution of isolated be stars may have a even lower mass peak .",
    "the number of isolated be stars originating from disrupted be / ns systems in the standard model is estimated to be @xmath184 , about 10 times the number of the surviving be / ns systems .",
    "the masses of the be stars are generally larger than @xmath185 , similar as in be / ns systems .",
    "the second and much more important formation channel of isolated be stars is the merger of two ms stars . in the standard model ,",
    "the number of be stars formed through mergers is @xmath186 , similar as in models i and iii .",
    "this is much more than from the disrupted be / ns systems .",
    "more importantly , the predicted be stars tend to have low masses , compatible with the observation ( we need to mention that in the observed sample in fig .  9 ( also in figs . 10 and 11 below )",
    "is obviously incomplete , so we can only compare the shapes of the distributions ) , suggesting that mergers are more promising in forming isolated be stars .",
    "in this paper , we investigate the formation of be stars through mass transfer and mergers in binaries . in fig .",
    "10 we present the mass distributions of all be stars in binaries , and of isolated be stars formed from disrupted be / ns and be / bh systems .",
    "the thick blue line reflects the overall distribution of these be stars . for @xmath187 ,",
    "it is dominated by be stars with a he star and a wd companion .",
    "more massive be stars are likely to be isolated be stars from disrupted be / ns systems .",
    "how important is binary interaction in the formation of be stars ?",
    "since mergers of two ms stars may also produce be stars , we compare in fig .",
    "11 the mass distributions of be stars formed through channel 1 and mergers in the standard model , as well as all b type stars with the blue , green , and black lines , respectively .",
    "their numbers are correspondingly @xmath188 , @xmath189 , and @xmath190 .",
    "obviously these numbers depend on the fraction of massive binaries , imf , and the initial mass ratio distribution .",
    "the fraction of binaries in the galaxy has been shown to be @xmath191 with orbital periods between @xmath192 days and @xmath193 days @xcite .",
    "so we take the binary fraction to be between 50% and 100% , and plot the calculated fraction of be stars in b type stars in fig .  12 .",
    "@xcite concluded that no more than 60% of the population of be stars are formed through case b binary evolution .",
    "@xcite found that a minority of the be stars ( less than 20% and possibly as low as 5% ) are due to close binary interaction .",
    "our results show that , combining the effects of both mass transfer and merger , the fraction of be stars in b type stars can reach @xmath194 , compatible with the observational results of @xmath195 @xcite and @xmath196 @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that all the numbers of be stars cited in this work should be taken as upper limits , because not all rapidly rotating b type stars exhibit the be phenomenon .",
    "finally we summarize our results as follows .",
    "\\(1 ) by considering different possible mass accretion histories for the mass gainer in a binary , we calculate the critical mass ratios for stable mass transfer .",
    "we find that in be / ns binaries the be star masses and orbital periods are consistent with observations if they are formed by stable and nonconservative mass transfer ( i.e. , channel 1 of model ii ) .",
    "\\(2 ) there are about @xmath197 isolated be stars in the galaxy originating from both disrupted be / ns systems and mergers of two ms stars , but the latter play a much more important role .",
    "\\(3 ) the ratio of be / ns binaries to the ones with bhs can be as small as @xmath198 , suggesting that there could exist a hidden population of be / bh binaries in the galaxy .",
    "\\(4 ) both be / he and be / wd binaries tend to have low - mass be stars and orbital periods of tens of days .",
    "most of the he stars in be / he binaries are less massive than @xmath199 .",

    "the orbital period decreases from 3.2 day to 2 days after @xmath204 mass has been transferred to the secondary .",
    "meanwhile , the mass transfer rate rises to @xmath205 . at this time",
    "the radius of the secondary exceeds its rl radius and the binary becomes contact . in the middle panel , the initial @xmath206",

    "the primary has evolved off the ms and entered the shell - burning phase when rlof initiates .",
    "the mass transfer proceeds rapidly but stably at a rate @xmath207 .",
    "a small amount ( @xmath208 ) of the transferred material is able to spin up the secondary into a be star , and the rest of the material is assumed to be ejected out of the system .",
    "the orbital period decreases until the primary s mass drops to @xmath209 .",
    "after that the mass ratio reverses , and @xmath64 increases to @xmath210 days at the end of the evolution . after the envelope of the primary is stripped , a @xmath211 he core is left . in the bottom panel , the initial @xmath133",
    "is 320 days .",
