    "<S> thereby we make @xmath7 decay to random states by effective spontaneous emission with a strong rate @xmath101 , similar to the z - pumping , the decreasing energy gap between the dressed states gives rise to a leakage rate from ghz , @xmath102 ( using @xmath103 for odd @xmath104 and @xmath105 for even @xmath104 ) , which increases with the number of qubits @xmath2 .    </S>",

    "<S> these considerations , however , assume a weak driving @xmath122 , whereas for strong driving the pumping rate becomes limited by power broadening . </S>",
