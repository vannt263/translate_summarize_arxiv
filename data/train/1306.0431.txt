    "the gibbs measure is defined as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the partition function .",
    "a fundamental question for statistical physics models , such as the hard - core model , is whether there exists a unique or there are multiple infinite - volume gibbs measures on @xmath2 .",
    "an equivalent question is whether the influence of the boundary on the origin decays in the limit .",
    "more formally , for a box in @xmath2 of side length @xmath25 centered around the origin , let @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) denote the marginal probability that the origin is unoccupied conditional on the even ( odd , respectively ) vertices on the boundary being occupied . if @xmath28 then there is a unique gibbs measure on @xmath2 , and if this limit is @xmath29 then there are multiple gibbs measures .",
    "it is believed that there is a critical activity @xmath1 such that for @xmath30 uniqueness holds , and for @xmath31 non - uniqueness holds .",

    "a classical peierls type argument implies @xmath34  @xcite , and blanca et al .",
    "@xcite improved this upper bound to show @xmath35 .",
    "our focus is on the lower bound .",
    "weitz @xcite showed that @xmath36 .",
    "his result followed from the algorithmic result .",
    "for all graphs with constant maximum degree @xmath5 , @xmath6 , weitz  @xcite presented an @xmath4 for approximating the partition function . a central step in his approach",
    "is proving a certain decay of correlations property known as _ strong spatial mixing ( ssm ) _ on the graph @xmath20 .",
    "ssm says that for every @xmath37 , every @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and pair of configurations @xmath40 on @xmath41 which only differ on @xmath42 ( i.e. , @xmath43 then the difference in the influence of @xmath14 and @xmath44 on the marginal probability of @xmath11 decays exponentially in the distance of @xmath11 from the difference set  @xmath42 ( see section [ sec : prelim ] for formal definitions of these concepts ) .",
    "in contrast , _ weak spatial mixing ( wsm ) _ only requires that the influence decays exponentially in the distance to the set  @xmath41 .",
    "for the hard - core model , since fixing a vertex to be unoccupied ( or occupied ) can be realized by removing the vertex ( or the vertex and its neighbors , respectively ) , it then follows that ssm on a graph @xmath20 is equivalent to wsm for all vertex induced subgraphs of @xmath20 .    given @xmath45 where @xmath10 is an ordering of the neighbors of @xmath11 ,",
    "then weitz constructs a version of the tree of self - avoiding walks from @xmath37 that we will denote as @xmath46 ; see section [ sec : saw ] for its definition .",
    "the key property is that for every @xmath14 , if for all @xmath11 ssm holds on @xmath46 then ssm holds on @xmath20 .",
    "his variant of the self - avoiding walk tree fixes the leaves of the tree ( corresponding to the walk completing a cycle in @xmath20 ) to be occupied or unoccupied based on the ordering @xmath10 for the last vertex @xmath11 in the corresponding cycle .",
    "he then shows that ssm holds on the complete tree @xmath7 , and hence ssm holds on all trees of maximum degree @xmath5 when @xmath6 .",
    "restrepo et al .",
    "@xcite improve upon weitz s approach for @xmath2 by utilizing its structure to build a better `` bounding tree '' than @xmath7 .",
    "they define a set of branching matrices @xmath47 for @xmath48 corresponding to walks in @xmath2 containing no cycles of length @xmath49 ( see section [ sec : bm ] for a more formal introduction to these notions ) .",
    "the key point is that , for certain orderings @xmath14 , the tree @xmath8 is a subtree of the tree @xmath50 defined by @xmath47 .",
    "they then present a decay of correlation proof by using a suitable message passing approach for proving ssm for @xmath50 , and hence for @xmath8 as well .",
    "they show that ssm holds on @xmath51 for @xmath52 , and ssm holds on @xmath53 for @xmath54 .",
    "consequently , they establish that @xmath13 .",
    "in addition , a recent paper @xcite presents a simpler condition for establishing ssm based on the connective constant of @xmath2 , but the bounds obtained by that approach are currently weaker than  @xcite .",
    "our first result establishes a limit to these approaches by showing that ssm does not hold on @xmath55 .",
    "as mentioned earlier , in the construction of @xmath55 , the assignment for leaves depends on the ordering @xmath14 which , for every vertex @xmath11 , specifies an ordering of the neighbors of @xmath11 .",
    "since @xmath2 is vertex - transitive , it is natural to define an ordering that is identical for every vertex ( e.g. , based on an ordering of the directions @xmath56 , and @xmath57 ) , which we refer to as a _",
    "homogenous ordering_. thus , a homogenous ordering @xmath14 is one where @xmath58 for all @xmath59 .",
    "we prove the following result .",
    "[ thm : counter ] for",
    "all @xmath14 , all @xmath15 , ssm does not hold on @xmath8 .",
    "moreover , for all homogenous @xmath14 , all @xmath60 , ssm does not hold on @xmath8 .",
    "the theorem follows from considering a tree @xmath41 that is a subtree of @xmath8 and establishing the threshold for wsm on @xmath41 .",
    "the tree @xmath41 that we consider in the homogenous ordering case is quite simple .",
    "when @xmath61 is first in the ordering , the tree is simply the never - go - south tree ( see section  [ sec : counter ] ) . for any @xmath8 that is based on an inhomogeneous ordering @xmath14 ,",
    "we are able to find another general subtree for which the wsm does not hold when @xmath62 .",
    "such an example gives a strong evidence that in order to prove the ssm for @xmath2 when @xmath0 is close to the conjectured threshold , the self - avoiding walk tree approach might not be appropriate .",
    "there are subtrees of the saw tree of @xmath2 that have lower wsm threshold and hence one has to figure out an approach to exclude such trees .",
    "we then present an improvement of the approach of restrepo et al .",
    "@xcite for proving ssm for the trees @xmath50 .",
    "they consider a particular statistic of the marginal distributions of the vertices , and prove the correlation decay property inductively on the height .",
    "the statistics can be viewed as a message passing algorithm , a variant of belief propagation .",
    "the messages they consider are a natural generalization of the message which is used to analyze the complete tree up to the tree threshold @xmath63 ( which thereby reproves weitz s result @xcite ) .",
    "they establish a so - called dms condition as a sufficient condition for these messages to imply ssm holds on the tree under consideration .",
    "some of the limitations of their approach are that to find the settings for the parameters in their messages and the dms condition , they use a heuristic hill - climbing algorithm which might become trapped in local optima . in addition , verifying their dms condition is non - trivial .    in this paper , we consider piecewise linear functions for the messages . as a consequence , we can find these functions by solving a linear program .",
    "this yields improved results and simpler proofs of the desired contraction property .",
    "consequently , we prove ssm holds for @xmath51 when @xmath64 ( previously , @xmath65 by the dms condition ) and ssm holds for @xmath53 when @xmath66 ( previously , @xmath67 ) .",
    "this establishes the following theorem .",

    "an important observation that we repeat from the introduction to emphasize it , is that for the hard - core model , for a graph @xmath20 , ssm holds if and only if for all ( induced vertex ) subgraphs of @xmath20 wsm holds .",
    "we now detail weitz s self - avoiding walk tree construction @xcite . given @xmath17 , we fix an arbitrary ordering @xmath83 on the neighbors of each vertex @xmath84 in @xmath20 .",
    "let @xmath85 be the collection of these orderings . for each @xmath37 , the tree @xmath46 rooted at @xmath11",
    "is constructed as follows .",
    "consider the tree of self - avoiding walks originating from @xmath11 , including the vertices closing a cycle in the walks as leaves .",
    "denote this tree by @xmath86 .",
    "we assign a boundary condition to the leaves by the following rule .",
    "each leaf closes a cycle in @xmath20 , so say the leaf corresponds to vertex @xmath84 in @xmath20 and the path leading to the leaf corresponds to the path @xmath87 in @xmath20 .",
    "then if @xmath88 in the ordering @xmath83 we fix this leaf to be unoccupied , and if @xmath89 in the ordering @xmath83 we fix this leaf to be occupied .",
    "since we are in the hard core model , if the leaf is fixed to be unoccupied we simply remove that vertex from the tree . and",
    "if the leaf is fixed to be occupied , we remove that leaf and all of its neighbors from the tree , i.e. , we remove completely the subtree rooted at the parent of that leaf .",
    "if a boundary condition @xmath90 is assigned to a subset @xmath42 of @xmath20 , then the self - avoiding walk tree can also be constructed consistently to the boundary condition , i.e. , for a vertex @xmath91 of @xmath20 , we assign @xmath92 to every occurrence of @xmath84 in @xmath46 .",
    "weitz proves that , for any boundary condition on @xmath20 and any vertex @xmath11 , the marginal distribution of @xmath11 on @xmath20 is the same as the marginal distribution of the root of @xmath46 with the corresponding boundary condition .",
    "this further implies the following .",
    "[ thm : weitz ] for a specific @xmath0 , for any @xmath14 , if for all @xmath11 ssm holds for @xmath46 , then ssm holds for @xmath20 .",
    "let us first recall the recurrence of the marginal distributions on trees for the hard - core model .",
    "for now , we fix our infinite tree to be @xmath41 .",
    "let @xmath11 be a vertex of @xmath41 , and let @xmath93 denote the subtree of @xmath41 rooted at @xmath11 .",
    "let @xmath94 denote the children of @xmath11 in @xmath93 .",
    "let @xmath95 be the unoccupied probability of vertex @xmath11 in the subtree @xmath93 rooted at @xmath11 with boundary condition @xmath90 .",
    "it is straightforward to establish that @xmath95 satisfy the following recurrence : @xmath96 there are two special boundary conditions : one is called the odd boundary condition ( denoted as @xmath97 ) which occupies all the vertices at level @xmath98 when @xmath98 is odd ( and unoccupies when @xmath98 is even ) ; the other is called the even boundary condition ( denoted as @xmath99 ) which occupies all the vertices at level @xmath98 when @xmath98 is even ( and unoccupies when @xmath98 is odd ) .",
    "these two boundary conditions are the extremal ones , meaning that for any other boundary condition @xmath90 for the vertices at distance @xmath98 from the root @xmath100 of @xmath41 , @xmath101 when @xmath98 is even ( and with the inequalities reversed when @xmath98 is odd ) .    to see that wsm holds for the tree @xmath41 , it is enough to show that for the odd and even boundary conditions @xmath102 and @xmath103 , the difference of the marginal probabilities at the root @xmath104 decay exponentially in @xmath98 .",
    "recall that in order to show that uniqueness holds for @xmath2 for a certain @xmath0 , it is enough to show that for the same @xmath0 , ssm holds on a certain tree which is a super - tree of @xmath8 . due to the regularity of @xmath2 , in @xcite ,",
    "deterministic multi - type galton - watson trees are proposed to characterize the candidate super - trees .",
    "the trees can be defined by branching matrices in the following way .",
    "a branching matrix @xmath105 is simply a square matrix composed of non - negative integer entries .",
    "[ def : branching - matrix ] given a @xmath106 branching matrix @xmath105 , @xmath107 is the family of trees which can be generated under the following restrictions :    * each vertex in tree @xmath108 has its type @xmath109 .",
    "* each vertex of type @xmath110 has at most @xmath111 children of type @xmath112 .",
    "we use @xmath113 to refer to the tree that is generated by the matrix @xmath105 , specifically , we mean the largest tree in the family @xmath114 .",

    ", @xmath117 is the complete , regular tree of degree @xmath118 . because of the regularity of @xmath2",
    ", it is clear that @xmath8 is a subtree of @xmath117 . as shown in @xcite , a more sophisticated set of branching matrices @xmath119 which contain @xmath55 in their family are trees @xmath120 corresponding to all walks of @xmath2 truncated when closing a cycle of length less than or equal to a certain constant @xmath121 .",
    "clearly , @xmath120 is a super - tree of @xmath122 , because any path in @xmath120 will only avoid cycles of length @xmath123 whereas paths in @xmath8 are avoiding all cycles .",
    "when one tries to avoid a cycle of length @xmath118 , the matrix becomes @xmath124 where each type is simply representing the various stages of completing a cycle of length @xmath118 in a walk .",
    "it is easy to verify that @xmath8 , for any @xmath14 , is in the family @xmath125 .    in @xmath126 , we have not yet taken into consideration the effect of the assignments to leaves as detailed in the construction of @xmath127 in section [ sec : saw ] .",
    "when we do that , we are able to construct much more sophisticated branching matrices which yield better bounds . therefore , for @xmath48 , let @xmath47 denote the branching matrix generating the tree containing all walks in @xmath2 truncated when completing a cycle of length @xmath123 , where these leaf vertices are occupied or unoccupied according to the definition in section [ sec : saw ] based on some fixed homogeneous ordering @xmath14 of the neighbors for every vertex . by taking into account the boundary condition",
    "we obtain a smaller tree since when a walk closes a cycle with an occupied assignment to a vertex @xmath128 , this forces the parent of @xmath128 to be unoccupied , which further trims down the size of the tree .",
    "these more sophisticated matrices yield a `` tighter '' bound on @xmath8 , however the number of types increase .",
    "for example , for @xmath129 , whereas @xmath126 has 4 types , @xmath130 has 17 types ( after some simplifications ) , see @xcite for details of @xmath130 . for @xmath131",
    "there are 132 types , and for @xmath132 there are @xmath133 types .      for each @xmath134 by @xmath134 branching matrix @xmath105",

    "we use @xmath137 to denote the type of vertex @xmath138 .",
    "the following lemma , which is re - stating lemma 1 from @xcite in a slightly simpler form that is more convenient for our work , provides a sufficient condition for ssm to hold for the tree @xmath113 .",

    "a natural way to generate @xmath105 is using a dfs program that enumerates all of the types by remembering the history of the self - avoiding walk .",

    "directly is not possible , as the data will not even fit in memory .",
    "notice that the lps we create have high constraint - variable ratios .",

    "using column generation we obtain an lp that can be solved , but running the method takes too long .",
    "next we will present two of our major techniques to reduce the size of the lps so that we can solve them within a few days .      in theorem [ thm : lp ] , we break the intervals into subintervals of the same size . the algorithm was designed to start with a very coarse set of the subintervals with a uniform length and if the lp has no solution , then the algorithm will try to decrease the length and re - solve the new lp .",

    "the goal of breaking intervals is to change the primal constraints so that the objective function @xmath11 can be achieved at a smaller value . in column generation ,",
    "shadow prices are used for this purpose . however , here deciding which intervals to break , affects the objective in a nonlinear fashion .",

    "the algorithm will pick several intervals with the highest prices to break .",
    "the reason why we scale by a factor which is a function of the size of the interval is that we do not want to break the intervals that are already very small . in figure [ figure - phii ] we show a step function @xmath352 for a type @xmath110 in @xmath353 found by the lps .",
    "one can observe from the figure that most of the intervals have large lengths ; in fact , there are some small intervals in the middle as these are the intervals that create tight constraints .",

    "note that for @xmath98 even , @xmath357 corresponds to the even boundary , and @xmath358 corresponds to the odd boundary .",
