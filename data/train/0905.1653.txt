    "the recent claim from the pamela collaboration of an excess in the ratio of positrons to electrons plus positrons ( positron fraction ) , seems to support what heat and ams01 data suggested regarding the existence of a possible primary cosmic ray electrons source .",
    "however some uncertainties remain , e.g the possible enhancement of the positron flux due to the relatively poor knowledge of the propagation parameters set @xcite .",
    "a large number of candidates have been suggested that may be able to reproduce the observed positron fraction . among the exotic ones , annihilating dark matter",
    "may be the most widely studied .",
    "dark matter is assumed to annihilate in the galactic halo and its annihilation products should reach the earth and be measured .",
    "as it has been pointed out in previous works @xcite , pamela data seems to accommodate preferably leptonic channels rather than dark matter decaying to quark pairs , but typically large boost factors are required to adjust the shape to the data .",
    "this boost factors are related to an increase of the annihilation rate due to e.g. the recently invoked sommerfeld effect , annihilation of a non thermal wimp , or the usual inhomogeneities of the dark matter halo ie , clumps , dark matter mini spikes etc ... moreover , to accomodate theory to the existing data , different normalizations are required for the different experiments .",
    "more conventional scenarios can also reproduce the spectral shape . specifically in this work we analyse the possible contribution of nearby astrophysical objects i.e. pulsars , and for leptophilic dark matter .",
    "+ in the case of multiple sources , a natural explanation for the spectral shape in the atic data is found , namely the presence of peaks in the spectrum can be reproduced in case we have a convenient selection of pulsars , or in case we have a distribution of clumps contributing to the total flux with the required luminosity , however it is necessary to fine tune the pulsar parameters to fit the peaks present in the atic spectrum . on the contrary ,",
    "the fermi data shows a much flatter spectrum that can be easily reproduced by pulsars with standard parametrizations .",
    "we calculate the predicted dipole anisotropy produced in both scenarios , i.e annihilating dark matter clumps and nearby pulsars , and assess the fermi detection capability of such signature at least at the 2 sigma confidence level .",
    "cosmic ray propagation is a diffusive process due to the random galactic magnetic fields .",
    "if we denote the number of particles of type @xmath1 per unit volume found in a time t at @xmath2 with energy @xmath3 by @xmath4 @xmath5 $ ] , the evolution equation as initially written by @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xcite can be expressed as :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the diffusion term with @xmath10 @xmath11 $ ] the diffusion tensor ; @xmath12 is the convection term with @xmath13 @xmath14 $ ] the velocity of the galactic wind ; @xmath15 represents the energy loss with @xmath16 @xmath17 $ ] the rate of energy change ; @xmath18 is the fraction of particles lost by radioctive decay with a characteristic life - time @xmath19 @xmath20 $ ] ; @xmath21 is the number density of particles created or destroyed by spallation processes in the propagation due to interactions with the interestellar medium of density n , with a characteristic cross section @xmath22 @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "finally we have the source term @xmath24 @xmath25 $ ] that injects particles of type @xmath1 into the galaxy . for electron and positron propagation ,",
    "the relevant processes are diffusion , convection , energy losses and the source term .",
    "propagation can be approached in two complementary ways .",
    "the first one is to solve the transport equation using numerical methods in the same way the package _ galprop _ @xcite does .",
    "the second one is to analytically solve the transport equation with a set of realistic simplifying assumptions . in this work",
    "we use the standard _",
    "galprop _ code to get the positron and electron backgrounds and an analytical solution of the propagation equation for the primary positron s flux . for primary positron sources ,",
    "we have used the green functions formalism as described in @xcite where the two main processes , diffusion and energy losses are considered . the resulting diffusion - loss equation for this process",
    "is given by :    @xmath26    [ diff - eq ]    where @xmath27 codifies the energy losses due to ( a ) inverse compton and synchrotron radiation , ( b ) bremsstrahlung and ( c ) ionisation .",
    "at the energies we are interested @xmath28 gev the energy loss is very well aproximated by the synchrotron losses in the interstellar ( ism ) magnetic fields and inverse compton off the cmb and starlight at optical and ir frequencies .",
    "the energy loss due to these processes is calculated as @xcite :    @xmath29    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the energy density @xmath30 is the energy density of the photon background [ @xmath31 with @xmath32 .",

    "+ for the diffusion coefficient @xmath36 , three setups max , med and min can be considered @xcite which are consistent with the b / c .",
    ".diffusion setups [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     the resulting fluxes are shown ( figs .",
    "[ pulsars ] and [ young ] ) for the considered scenarios . in order to account for the experimental data in the hundreds of gev ,",
    "the conversion efficiency into pairs of monogem and geminga must be above the nominal value of 3% but inside the standard range ( 1%-30% ) considered in @xcite .",
    "this values may change depending on the diffusion setup considered , the pwn @xmath37 release delay , pulsar cutoff etc ... so it should be considered as a single realisation of the multiple possibilities that can reproduce the data @xcite .",
    "according to the standard @xmath38cdm cosmological model , a @xmath39 of the energy content of the universe is in the form of cold dark matter ( cdm ) .",
    "probably the leading candidates to account for it are weakly interacting particles ( wimps ) , with the neutralino and the kaluza - klein boson @xmath40 the most extensively studied ones . the relic density of these particles is determined by their annihilation cross section .",
    "observations of the cmb and large scale structure surveys estimate the relic density constraining the annihilation cross section up to a canonical value of @xmath41 .",
    "this value sets the rate of production of standard model particles , e.g leptons , that can be measured as tracers of dark matter annihilation .",
    "+ the signal that results from dm annihilation , depends on the squared dm density from the astrophysical side , and on the dm particle mass and cross section from the particle physics side . since the annihilation rate depends on the squared density , the presence of clumpiness or substructure imply an enhancement of the signal compared to a smooth density distribution .",
    "the present dark matter structure is considered to have its roots in small amplitude quantum fluctuations during inflation . in the accepted `` bottom - up '' hierarchical structure formation , smaller clumps",
    "gather together to form larger systems , completely determined by the initial power spectrum of the primordial fluctuations .",
    "galaxies are thus embedded in large dark matter halos that in turn are made up of self - bound substructure or subhalos .",
    "the mass distribution , abundance and internal structure of clumps is determined by means of high - resolution numerical simulations as the one conducted by diemand et al.@xcite . in this work",

    "we assume for the spatially dependent number density a spherically symmetrical navarro , frenk&white ( nfw ) profile so the density of clumps is given by    @xmath49^{2 } } \\frac{dn_{d}}{d\\log(m / m_{\\odot})}\\ ] ]    where r=20kpc and @xmath50 for a correct normalization .    for the internal structure within a clump ,",

    "we assume a universal concentration parameter c for all the clumps , found to lie in diemands simulation within the @xmath53 range , and a constant density core below @xmath54kpc .    with all these considerations ,",
    "the source term can be expressed as :    @xmath55    where f(e ) denotes the number of positrons generated per annihilation and energy interval ( for each branching channel ) and @xmath56 is the integrated squared density for each dm clump    @xmath57    once we have the source term we proceed to calculate the flux at the earth by solving the steady state ( @xmath58 ) of eq.[diff - eq ] as already done e.g in @xcite or @xcite .",
    "the eq.[diff - eq ] can be greatly simplified translating the energy into s(e ) .",
    "@xmath59    the equation then reads :    @xmath60    where @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the solution , is given by the convolution of the green function over the sources :    @xmath63    where the green function is given by :    @xmath64}{d[e(s_0)]}\\frac{e^{-(\\vec{x}-\\vec{x_0})^2/d_{diff}^{2}}}{[\\pi d_{diff}^2]^{3/2}}\\ ] ]    as a function of the integrating variable @xmath65 .",
    "@xmath66 is the diffusion distance scale given by @xmath67 in terms of the variable s(e ) with e the observed energy and @xmath68 the energy at injection .",
    "as previously stated , pamela data favours leptophilic dm , ie , candidates which annihilation products are predominantely leptons . the case of direct annihilation into electron and positron pairs can provide good fits to the atic data but it is excluded if we take into account the fermi results due to a sharp drop at the end - point ( see e.g. @xcite ) . therefore we are left with annihilations into @xmath69 and @xmath70 which provide a much softer injection spectrum and can accomodate both pamela and fermi . for such injection spectrums , large annihilation rates are required",
    ". the astrophysical boost factor , i.e , boost based on the presence of clumpiness , has been proved to be inssufficient to account for the required normalization to adjust the data . in this respect , proposals of particle physics boost factors as velocity dependent cross sections , have been recently considered .",
    "+ in this work our purpose is to evaluate the expected anisotropy resulting from sources that reproduces the observed abundances , so we will assume the required normalization to fit the data as a result of any of the considered mechanisms that can boost the annihilation rate . here",
    ", we consider a dm candidate that annilates into @xmath70 with a mass of 3.6 tev ( fig .",

    "[ fig : fig1 ]    we also address the posibility of a nearby dm clump being the responsible of the bulk of positrons found in the fermi , atic and pamela data . for this purpose , we treat here the clump as a point - like object at a given distance _",

    "this possibility has been found to be very unlikely unless the sommerfeld effect is at play , but such a source would imprint a signature in the electron arrival direction that could constitute a signal of dark matter annihilation given the absence of pulsars in the neighbourhood . in this sense ,",
    "the evaluation of such a signal makes the study meaningful .",

    "diffusion competes with large energy losses resulting in relatively short paths @xmath71o(kpc ) , so it is expected that we can use them to sample only sources within a certain distance and age .",

    "<S> recent results from the pamela @xcite , atic @xcite , ppb bets @xcite and fermi @xcite collaborations extend the energy range in the @xmath0 measurement up to unexplored energies in the hundred gevs range confirming the bump starting at about 10gev already suggested by heat @xcite and ams01 data @xcite . this bump can be explained by annihilating dark matter in the context of exotic physics , or by nearby astrophysical sources e.g. pulsars . in order to discriminate between competing models for primary positron production , </S>",
    "<S> the study of anisotropies , complementary to the spectrum determination , shows up as new tool to look for the origin of the lepton excess . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the contribution to the electron flux given by the collection of all known gamma ray pulsars ( as listed in the atnf catalogue ) and by annihilating dark matter both in case we have a clumpy halo or in case the excess can be atributed to a nearby sizeable dark matter clump . </S>",
    "<S> we address the problem of the electron anisotropy in both scenarios and estimate the prospect that a small dipole anisotropy can be found by the fermi observatory .    </S>",
