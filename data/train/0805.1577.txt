    "the wide gap semiconductors zno , gan and their alloys with wurtzite or zinc - blende structures have provoked a lot of interest in the last few years , largely due to the good optical properties as well as great potential in optoelectronics.@xcite very recently , some attention has also been given to the spin properties of these semiconductors.@xcite this is partly because of the prediction that zno can become ferromagnetic with a curie temperature above room temperature if doped with manganese.@xcite ferromagnetism and magnetoresistance in co - zno magnetic semiconductors have been also reported.@xcite moreover , long spin relaxation time observed in these materials is another promising property for possible applications in spintronic devices . ghosh _",
    "et al._@xcite have investigated the electron spin properties in @xmath4-type zno structures and discovered the electron spin relaxation time varying from 20  ns to 190ps when the temperature increases from 10 to 280  k. room temperature electron spin relaxation as long as 25  ns has also been measured by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy in colloidal @xmath4-doped zno quantum dots.@xcite in gan , beschoten _ et al._@xcite reported the electron spin lifetime of 20  ns from @xmath5  k to room temperature .",
    "recently , hole spin relaxation time about 350  ps at 1.7  k in zno epilayer has also been reported.@xcite    spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) is the key issue of semiconductor spintronics.@xcite most of the proposed schemes of electrical generation , manipulation and detection of electron or hole spins rely on the soc .",
    "a thorough understanding of the soc is therefore very important .",
    "in contrast to the zinc - blende semiconductors such as gaas , the existence of hexagonal @xmath6 axis in wurtzite semiconductors leads to an added intrinsic wurtzite structure inversion asymmetry ( wsia ) in addition to the bulk inversion asymmetry ( bia).@xcite therefore , the electron spin splittings include both the dresselhaus effect ( cubic in @xmath1 ) and rashba effect ( linear in @xmath1).@xcite the rashba effect has been vigorously discussed using group theory and @xmath0 arguments by lew yan voon _",

    "moreover , the anisotropic spin splitting is more distinct for the hh , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6](a ) . of course , for large momentum , the spin splittings of both structures show anisotropy . in addition , it is interesting to see that although the lowest conduction band and the soh band have different symmetries ( @xmath99 and @xmath73 respectively ) , they share the same form of soc . from the red and black curves in fig .",
    "[ fig6](a ) , one can see that electron and soh have similar momentum dependence of spin splitting .    the electron soc coefficient is shown in fig .  [ fig6](b ) and ( c ) .",
    "similar to the wurtzite case , @xmath9 keeps constant near the @xmath11 point and is independent on the direction of the in - plane momentum .",

    "in conclusion , we have investigated the electron and hole soc up to third order in wurtzite semiconductors . due to the intrinsic structure inversion asymmetry in addition to the bulk inversion asymmetry in wurtzite structure ,",
    "both the linear rashba effect and cubic dresselhaus effect exist .",
    "we find the relative signs of the rashba and dresselhaus terms are opposite for electrons but are the same for holes in both zno and gan . for holes with @xmath74 symmetry ,",
    "there is no linear rashba contribution . due to the negative spin splitting in zno , the signs of the rashba coefficients for both electrons and holes are opposite with those in gan .",
    "the dresselhaus spin splittings in wurtzite zno and gan are calculated by the nearest - neighbor @xmath2 tb model .",
    "we find that the electron dresselhaus term becomes the dominant soc compared with the linear rashba term when the electron concentration is higher than @xmath137  @xmath138 for zno and @xmath139  @xmath138 for gan . while for the @xmath73 and @xmath75 holes",
    ", the linear term can not be neglected due to the relatively larger hole rashba soc coefficient .",
    "the corresponding soc coefficients @xmath103 are also calculated , which are momentum - independent very near the @xmath11 point . however , at large momentum , they decrease drastically and show strong angular dependence of the in - plane momentum . in addition , we confirm that the dresselhaus parameter @xmath10 is almost a constant for very small momentum and can be regarded approximately as an universal value for all the wurtzite materials as predicted in ref .. however , for larger momentum , its @xmath1-dependence can not be neglected and the value varies strongly for different materials .    in order to compare with the zinc - blende structure , the spin splittings in cubic gan are also addressed , calculated using @xmath3 model .",
    "the isotropic spin splitting near the @xmath11 point in wurzite structures does not hold in zinc - blende structure .",
    "we believe that our results are useful for the on - going study of spin dynamics of zno and gan .",
    "after all , due to the small soc in these wide gap semiconductors , the spin relaxation time becomes very long and hence more potential applications may be figured out using these semiconductors .",
    "finally , we point out that due to the lack of the tb parameters for zno of zinc - blende structure , we can not calculate the soc coefficients for this structure .",
