    "the purpose of this paper is to discuss the importance of the rate of growth of the invariant four - volume @xmath0 of stationary non - degenerate black holes and how this rate of growth is related to their surface gravity . now whereas the three - volume of a black hole depends on the choice of slicing @xcite , and in general the associated three - volumes are finite , the full four - volume @xmath0 is usually never discussed since it is formally infinite .",
    "( consider , for example , the four - volume of the region on and below the future horizons in the kruskal - szekeres plane . ) even if we consider the black hole as created by the gravitational collapse of an object and so consider only part of the kruskal - szekeres plane on and below the future horizon and to the future of the boundary surface of the collapsing object , the four - volume still diverges as we integrate to the infinite future .",
    "however , we need not integrate to the infinite future and so in effect consider the evolution of @xmath0 . in this paper , to start , we examine explicitly in regular coordinates the four - volume bounded by the horizon , the central singularity and two distinct ingoing null cones in the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "the situation is shown schematically in figure [ figure ] .",
    "this introductory calculation points out a relation which we eventually show is a universal feature of stationary black holes : the invariant 4-volume @xmath0 of a black hole grows as @xmath4 where @xmath3 is the affine generator of the horizon and the constant of proportionality is the parikh volume @xmath5 @xcite ( equivalent to the euclidean 3-volume in spherical symmetry ) divided by the surface gravity ( @xmath6 ) . defining @xmath7 then we have an alternative definition of the surface gravity : @xmath8 .",
    "however , the reissner - nordstrm - de sitter class of black holes , for example , contain unstable cauchy horizons within their event horizons @xcite and so one might argue that in such cases we would be integrating over unphysical regions of the spacetime . to overcome this",
    "we show that the four - volume of a shell ( @xmath2 ) which terminates on the horizon is well defined and the shell can obviously be constructed so as to exclude the cauchy horizons . in this case",
    "we find @xmath9 and so @xmath6 is in fact independent of the  depth \" of integration .",
    "we use such a construction to consider cosmological horizons and to argue that because of this independence on depth , @xmath6 is a property of the horizon alone .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : first we give a general overview of the static spacetimes involved with our preliminary considerations .",
    "then the invariant partial 4-volume of a schwarzschild black hole is calculated explicitly in regular coordinates . to consider more general cases we first review the construction of regular coordinates for non - degenerate static black holes .",
    "we then calculate the invariant 4-volume @xmath0 in this more general context and explain the shell construction necessary for the consideration of cosmological horizons . to move on to the stationary case we first review parikh s construction and we then show that @xmath9 holds in general .",
    "the explicit verification in the kerr metric is relegated to an appendix .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of this alternative definition of the surface gravity .",
    "the static spacetimes under consideration here can be written in the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the metric of a unit two - sphere ( @xmath12 ) and @xmath13 , a polynomial with simple root(s ) which locate the horizon(s ) . within the context of classical general relativity the form ( [ fform ] )",
    "is of course well known as it includes the reissner - nordstrm - de sitter class of black holes .",
    "the form is also of interest for regular black holes ( those without internal singularities ) , a subject that goes back many years @xcite . the curious appearance of ( [ fform ] ) ( that is , @xmath14 ) has been discussed recently by jacobson @xcite who showed , amongst other things , that the central feature of ( [ fform ] ) is the vanishing radial null - null component of the ricci tensor .",
    "alternatively , consider the metric @xmath15 where @xmath16 . since @xmath17 is a polynomial with simple root(s )",
    "let us write @xmath18 where @xmath19 .",
    "whereas for ( [ fform ] ) all scalars constructed from the riemann tensor are finite for @xmath20 and @xmath21 , for ( [ jform ] ) these scalars diverge at @xmath22 unless @xmath23 .",
    "this , in some measure , helps to explain the prevalence of ( [ fform ] ) .",
    "the from ( [ fform ] ) is defective at @xmath22 and so for our considerations of @xmath0 we need regular coordinates .",
    "we begin with a calculation of the complete invariant 4-volume of a schwarzschild black hole in regular coordinates .",
    "as shown elsewhere @xcite , the kruskal @xcite - szekeres @xcite form of the schwarzschild metric can be given explicitly as @xmath24 where @xmath25 with @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the lambert w function @xcite .",
    "trajectories with tangents @xcite @xmath28 ( constant @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) are radial null geodesics given by @xmath31 where @xmath3 is an affine parameter ( defined , of course , only up to a linear transformation ) and we note the expansion @xmath32 trajectories with tangents @xmath33 ( constant @xmath34 and @xmath30 ) are radial null geodesics given by @xmath35 and we now note the expansion @xmath36 on the horizons @xmath37 and @xmath38 then @xmath39 and @xmath40 are affine parameters . the only singularity in ( [ ks2 ] ) occurs for @xmath41",
    ". that is , @xmath42 .",
    "as is well known , the invariant 4-volume over some region @xmath43 of spacetime is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the determinate of the metric and the integration is over @xmath43 .",
    "for the present calculation , @xmath43 is defined in figure [ figure1 ] .    from ( [ volume ] ) ,",
    "( [ ks2 ] ) and ( [ basemetric ] ) we have @xmath46 from which we find @xmath47 so that with @xmath48 from ( [ u0 ] ) we arrive at the manifestly invariant statement @xmath49 irrespective of initial conditions . this relation can be written in the equivalent form @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the surface gravity ( see below ) and @xmath52 is the euclidean 3-volume ( also see below as the euclidean form is due to the symmetry ) . defining @xmath53 we rewrite ( [ finalvol ] ) as @xmath54",
    "we start with a known construction @xcite of regular coordinates for spherically symmetric static spacetimes with non - degenerate horizons .      from ( [ fform ] )",
    "it follows that there exists coordinates @xmath40 and @xmath39 defined by @xmath55 and @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a constant .",
    "the trajectories of constant @xmath40 ( variable @xmath39 ) and of constant @xmath39 ( variable @xmath40 ) label radial null geodesics .",
    "in particular , note that @xmath58 which , though obvious , is of particular use in what follows .",
    "the intermediate form of the metric is @xmath59 where now @xmath60 .",
    "since ( [ intermediate ] ) remains defective at @xmath22 , decompose @xmath17 as @xmath61 where @xmath62 and finite .",
    "it follows that @xmath63 where the sign depends on how we choose to orientate the @xmath64 axis and @xmath65 is a constant .",
    "we now have @xmath66 where now , from ( [ rtrans ] ) , @xmath67 . from ( [ doublenull ] )",
    "we see that there is but one choice for @xmath57 that gives a regular covering at @xmath22 , @xmath68 where we have defined the surface gravity @xcite @xmath69 finally we note that @xmath70 in summary : under the transformations ( [ rtrans ] ) and ( [ ttrans ] ) the metric ( [ fform ] ) takes the form @xmath71 where again from ( [ rtrans ] ) , @xmath67 and @xmath72 the integration constant has been absorbed into the factor @xmath73 and again the choice of sign determines the orientation of the @xmath64 axis . under these transformations",
    "the killing vector @xmath74 becomes @xmath75 note that the specified construction can always be done .",
    "however , about a distinct root , say @xmath76 , a new chart must be constructed about @xmath77 . with @xmath78",
    "we arrive back at ( [ basemetric ] ) with ( [ ks2 ] ) .",
    "it is convenient to start with the intermediate form ( [ intermediate ] ) so that with ( [ c ] ) we have , prior to specifying boundary conditions , @xmath79 we now consider a shell ( @xmath2 ) from @xmath22 to @xmath80 and make use of ( [ utype ] ) and ( [ c ] ) to write @xmath81 and so from ( [ intv ] ) and ( [ intu ] ) @xmath82 as explained below , a shell - type construction is needed for the consideration of cosmological horizons .",
    "to interpret @xmath39 we now use the regular form ( [ kruskal ] ) with ( [ k ] )",
    ". trajectories with tangents @xmath83 ( constant @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) are radial null geodesics with expansion @xmath84 trajectories with tangents @xmath85 ( constant @xmath34 and @xmath30 ) are radial null geodesics with expansion @xmath86 we set the horizons @xmath22 at @xmath37 and @xmath38 so that @xmath39 and @xmath40 are affine parameters",
    ". we can now rewrite ( [ ratev ] ) in the form @xmath87 note that section iii above can be recovered form this section by setting @xmath88 and @xmath78 . proceeding as above and defining @xmath89 we rewrite ( [ ratevg ] ) as @xmath90 we see that @xmath6 is in effect independent of the thickness of the shell @xmath2 and so we view it as a property of the horizon alone .",
    "the foregoing argument applies directly to cosmological ( and cauchy ) horizons with the insertion of an absolute value in the definition of the surface gravity in ( [ surf ] ) .",
    "we emphasize this point here by way of a direct calculation in de sitter space in regular coordinates .",
    "a complete covering of de sitter space is given by @xmath91 where @xmath92 and we consider the region @xmath93 .",
    "trajectories with tangents @xmath94 ( constant @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) are radial null geodesics given by @xmath95 where @xmath3 is an affine parameter and @xmath96 . if @xmath97 then the geodesic is affinely parameterized by @xmath39 .",
    "we note the expansion @xmath98 trajectories with tangents @xmath99 ( constant @xmath34 and @xmath30 ) are radial null geodesics given by @xmath100 for @xmath101 . if @xmath102 then the geodesic is affinely parameterized by @xmath40 .",
    "we now note the expansion @xmath103 on the cosmological horizons @xmath104 , @xmath37 or @xmath38 and so @xmath39 and @xmath40 are affine parameters .",
    "there are no singularities in ( [ desitter ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath105 for @xmath106 and @xmath107 for @xmath42 . to calculate a finite volume @xmath0 for a cosmological horizon we integrate from @xmath104 out to ( say ) @xmath108 where @xmath109 .",
    "the situation considered is qualitatively similar to figure [ figure1 ] but note that @xmath110 is now increasing along @xmath111 .",
    "we now have @xmath112 where @xmath113 .",
    "we find @xmath114 so that we arrive at the manifestly invariant statement @xmath115 irrespective of initial conditions .",
    "it is a simple matter to show that ( [ initialds ] ) is equivalent to ( [ ratevg ] ) and therefore ( [ kappaform ] ) .",
    "all calculations up to this point can be considered merely motivational ( but we think important ) for the brief argument that now follows .",
    "parikh @xcite has considered the volume @xmath116 for spacetimes with non - degenerate killing vectors @xmath117 with killing parameter @xmath118 where @xmath119 .",
    "( because the parikh volume is a rate , we have introduced a superscript @xmath120 for consistency with ( [ vstar ] ) . )",
    "it is important to note that the integrand in ( [ parikh ] ) refers to the full spacetime and not a slice of it . for static spherically symmetric spacetimes",
    "it is easy to show that the parikh volume at a horizon @xmath22 is simply the euclidean 3-volume @xmath121 .",
    "however , away from ( say ) spherical symmetry , this will not be the case .",
    "now let us write @xmath122 the right hand equivalence is a usual definition of the surface gravity @xmath6 ( see , for example , wald @xcite ) .",
    "the left hand equivalence is our interpretation of @xmath6 , as verified explicitly in the foregoing motivational calculations .",
    "further explicit calculations seem essentially pointless in view of obvious equality in the center of ( [ fullkappa ] ) , and so we relegate the explicit verification in the kerr metric to the appendix .",
    "the usual physical meaning given to the surface gravity is , as explained for example by poisson @xcite ,  the force required of an observer at infinity to hold a particle ( of unit mass ) stationary at the horizon \" ( think of the schwarzschild case ) .",
    "the interpretation given here , that the surface gravity is the ratio of the parikh volume to the rate of change of the invariant four - volume for a shell of arbitrary ( but non - vanishing ) thickness bounded by the horizon , is a local interpretation that would appear to be new .",
    "an important question is , can we use this to gain further insights into black hole mechanics ?",
    "the most obvious conclusion regards the third law of black hole mechanics , @xmath123 .",
    "since @xmath124 even in the degenerate case ( consider , for example , the static spherically symmetric case ) we see that the third law demands that the rate of growth @xmath125 must remain finite . in order to violate the third law we need @xmath126 and since @xmath127 is finite , this requires @xmath128 in agreement with the formulation of israel @xcite .",
    "that is , in a sequence of quasi - static steps , the reduction of @xmath6 to zero would take infinite advanced time .",
