    "anomaly is a violation of symmetry at the quantum level . in the case of a continuous symmetry , anomaly means non - conservation of the corresponding noether current . for discrete symmetries ,",
    "however , there are no corresponding noether currents . but fujikawa s method @xcite , which is based on the calculation of the jacobian of the path - integral measure , can be used to define anomaly of discrete symmetries .",
    "let us start by considering a yang - mills theory with massless fermions @xmath4 in euclidean space time , which can be described by the following lagrangian and the path - integral : @xmath5},~ { \\cal l}=i{\\bar \\psi}{\\not d}\\psi-\\frac{1}{2g^{2 } }              { \\bf tr}\\ f^{\\mu\\nu}f_{\\mu\\nu } ,",
    "\\\\   & & d_{\\mu}=\\partial_{\\mu}-ia_{\\mu}\\ , \\ a_{\\mu}\\equiv gt^{a}a^{a}_{\\mu }     \\ , \\ { \\bf tr}[t^{a}t^{b}]=\\frac{1}{2}\\delta^{ab},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have dropped the path - integral measure of the gauge boson @xmath6 , because it does not contribute to anomaly .",
    "then we make a chiral phase rotation @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a discrete parameter . under this finite transformation ,",
    "the lagrangian is invariant , but the path - integral measure is not invariant in general , i.e. @xmath9 and the corresponding jacobian can be written as @xmath10\\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this jacobian has the same form as the jacobian for a continuous transformation @xcite .",
    "so we see that it makes sense to talk about anomaly of discrete symmetries @xcite .",
    "unlike to @xcite , in which only abelian discrete symmetries are considered , we do not assume that the discrete symmetry in question arises from the spontaneous break down of a continues local symmetry .",
    "we instead assume that an anomalous discrete symmetry at low energy is remnant of an anomaly free discrete symmetry , and that its low energy anomaly is cancelled by the gs mechanism @xcite at a more fundamental scale .",
    "first we discuss the abelian case and consider a @xmath11 transformation in a supersymmetric gauge theory , @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are a chiral superfield and a vector superfield , respectively .",
    "the transformation parameter @xmath8 is a discrete parameter , i.e. @xmath15 . the jacobian of this transformation appears in the superpotential as @xcite @xmath16_{f }    + i{\\cal a}{\\bf tr }        \\left[\\theta\\bar{w}_{\\dot{a}}\\bar{w}^{\\dot{a}}\\right]_{f},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is an anomaly coefficient , and @xmath18 is the chiral superfield for the gauge supermultiplet . this anomaly can be canceled by a shift of the dilaton superfield @xmath19 @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the kac - moody level .",
    "( for a non - abelian group , @xmath21 is a positive integer , while there is no restriction in the abelian case . ) as we can see from ( [ s ] ) , only the imaginary part of the scalar component of @xmath19 , which is the axion , should be shifted .",
    "therefore , the khler potential does not change , because the vector superfield does not change under the transformation ( [ eq,2 ] ) . from these observations , we can now obtain the anomaly cancellation conditions of the discrete symmetry",
    "@xmath22 @xcite : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are anomaly coefficients of @xmath26^{2}z_n\\ $ ] and @xmath27^{2}z_n\\ $ ] , respectively , and @xmath28 are integers .",
    "the conditions containing products of @xmath29 is omitted , because @xmath30 is not constrained to be an integer .",
    "the constants @xmath31 and @xmath32 take into account the contributions from heavy majorana and dirac fermions @xcite . as we will see in the next section , eq .",
    "( [ eq,3 ] ) exhibits the anomaly cancellation conditions for non - abelian discrete family symmetries , too .",
    "we first recall that the string coupling @xmath33 is the vev of the dilaton field , which is the real scalar component of the dilaton superfield @xmath19 .",
    "further , the gauge couplings @xmath34 are related to the string coupling according to the corresponding kac - moody levels . therefore , gauge coupling unification conditions are @xmath35 at the string scale .",
    "so , the unification conditions depend on the kac - moody levels . keeping this in mind ,",
    "we proceed with our discussion on the non - abelian case .",
    "recently , a number of models with a non - abelian discrete family symmetry are proposed @xcite .",
    "if only the sm higgs is present within the framework of renormalizable models , any non - abelian family symmetry should be hardly broken .",
    "that is , if a non - abelian family symmetry should be at most softly broken , we need more than two @xmath1 doublet higgs fields .",
    "this implies that the conditions of the ordinary unification of gauge couplings , i.e. @xmath36 , will be very difficult to be satisfied .",
    "however , as indicated in eq .",
    "( [ eq,4 ] ) , there is a possibility to satisfy the unification conditions at the string scale for non - trivial values of the kac - moody levels .",
    "before we study the unification conditions for a concrete model , we derive the gs cancellation conditions for the non - abelian case below . to this end",
    ", we consider the lagrangian @xmath37 and a non - abelian discrete chiral transformation @xmath38_{\\alpha\\beta}\\psi_{\\beta},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 are family indices .",
    "noticing that this transformation is a unitary transformation , we then calculate the jacobian and find @xmath40\\right\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 are defined as @xmath42,~~ { \\bf e}^{i\\theta_{l(r)}}\\equiv{\\bf det}\\left[{\\bf e}^{ix(y)}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , only the abelian parts of the non - abelian group contribute to anomaly , implying that the gs cancellation conditions for the non - abelian case are exactly the same as eq .",
    "( [ eq,3 ] ) for the abelian case .    to be more concrete",
    ", we consider the supersymmetric @xmath2 model of @xcite .",
    "according to our discussion above , to calculate anomaly of @xmath2 , it is sufficient to consider anomaly of its abelian subgroups @xmath43 and @xmath44 . in the model of @xcite , it turns out that the @xmath43 part does not have any anomaly , but @xmath44 , and its anomaly coefficients are computed as @xmath45 this anomaly can be canceled by the gs mechanism , if @xmath46 are satisfied . in string",
    "theory , lower kac - moody levels are preferable , and so @xmath47 , for example , is a preferable solution to ( [ level ] ) .",
    "let us see whether the unification conditions ( [ eq,4 ] ) with the levels satisfying ( [ level ] ) can be satisfied . to this end",
    ", we calculate the running of gauge couplings .",
    "fig.[fig,1 ] shows the ratio of @xmath48 ( upper line ) and @xmath49 ( lower line ) as a function energy scale . from the figure we see that @xmath49 near the planck scale @xmath50 gev is close to @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , we assume that the ratio of the two kac - moody levels is three , i.e. @xmath52 .",
    "fig.[fig,2 ] shows the running of @xmath53 with @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the unification scale is @xmath56 gev , which is slightly higher than @xmath57 .        in this example",
    "the gauge couplings do not exactly satisfy the unification conditions ( [ eq,4 ] ) at @xmath57 , but it is suggesting a right direction .",
    "if we take into account the threshold corrections at @xmath57 , for instance , the conditions could be exactly satisfied .",
