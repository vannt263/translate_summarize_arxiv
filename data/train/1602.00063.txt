    "while the field of chemical dynamics , including atomic and molecular collisional processes , has seen tremendous advances in theory , experiment , and computation over the past eight decades @xcite , computations which attempt to exactly solve the time - dependent ( td ) or time - independent ( ti ) schrdinger equation have been limited to consideration of only five @xcite and four atoms @xcite , respectively . in the former case ,",
    "solutions have been restricted to reactive processes , while the latter approach has focused on inelastic collisions , both incorporating full - dimensional dynamics on full - dimensional potential energy surfaces ( pess ) .",
    "part of the reason for the dimensional limitation in such calculations is the need for significant computational resources , but more importantly the development of software and algorithms to treat large multidimensional systems has stagnated .",
    "on the other hand , molecular electronic structure computations , or quantum chemistry , has seen rapid advances in both software and algorithm development with implementation on high performance distributed and shared - memory cpus @xcite as well as on new accelerator technologies such as graphical processing units ( gpus ) @xcite . using the coupled - cluster singles and doubles ( ccsd ) approach @xcite",
    ", it is possible today to compute and analytically fit electronic potential and coupling surfaces for systems as large as 10 atoms @xcite . as the number of internal degrees of freedom @xmath2 is @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the number of atoms , this corresponds to a 24-dimensional surface . as an illustration , figure  [ dofpot ] plots the pes dimension @xmath2 versus the number of atoms up to @xmath5 , which is approximately the limit for the size of the largest molecular systems that can be both computed on a classical compute and fitted for dynamical studies .",
    "however , the region show in green displays the largest systems that can be computed , again on a classical computer , using full dimensional dynamics for td reactive collisions .",
    "the region with @xmath6 can only be treated dynamically with quasi - classical methods , i.e. by solving newton s equations of motion for the heavy - particle trajectories .",
    "the situation for ti and quantum inelastic calculations is somewhat worse .     and",
    "pes dimension @xmath2 . regime of possible quantum scattering calculations ( green ) .",
    "regime of available pess which can currently only be treated by quasi - classical dynamical methods ( grey ) . ]    clearly computations of electronic structure have far out - paced the abilities of quantum dynamical calculations when the goal is to treat the problem nearly exact numerically and in full - dimension .",
    "therefore , it appears that there is an opportunity to apply other , more novel approaches to advance quantum chemical dynamical studies and one might naturally turn to quantum computing / simulation . there has been considerable effort to explore the prospects of applying quantum simulation to the electronic structure problem @xcite , but investigations of chemical dynamics have been sparse to date @xcite .",
    "the promising method of kassal et al @xcite applies a quantum gate - based logic approach , or digital quantum simulation ( dqs ) .",
    "however , the dqs method requires 100s of gate operations and 100s of high - fidelity , fault - tolerant qubits .",
    "as the quantum simulation hardware has not advanced sufficiently to satisfy these resource requirements , we have proposed an alternative approach , the single excitation subspace ( ses ) method , which avoids the need for fault - tolerant devices using instead available prethreshold superconducting technology @xcite .",
    "while the ses method may not be scalable , it can solve a time - dependent , real , symmetric quantum hamiltonian of dimension @xmath7 using @xmath0 qubits with a quantum computation time that is independent of @xmath0 for a single run .",
    "however , an ses computer must be fully connected requiring @xmath8 tunable couplers with @xmath0 also corresponding to the number of diabatic molecular channels in the collision problem to be simulated .",
    "the feasibility of the approach was outlined in geller et al @xcite for the simple , but well - studied @xmath9 na+he electronic excitation problem . here",
    "we extend that study to i ) ion - atom charge exchange systems with @xmath0 as large as ten , ii ) improve the trajectory calculation from the standard straight line , constant velocity approximation to explicitly solving for the relative velocity for a range of multichannel potential averaging schemes , and iii ) apply the ehrenfest symmetrization approach to correct for the loss of detail - balance due to potential averaging , with the latter two topics allowing for the classical calculations and ses simulations to be extended to low collision energies .",
    "iv ) to allow for a future classical - quantum resource comparison , a td propagator study is carried out to find the most efficient classical computational approach and v ) we end by speculating on the prospects of large - scale ses device applications to large , chemically interesting reactions not feasible on today s high performance computing platforms .",
    "while there are a variety of approaches to attack atomic and molecular collision problems on a classical computer , the one that is most relevant to the ses method is the semiclassical molecular - orbital close - coupling ( scmocc ) approach . in the scmocc method ,",

    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath15 and the system wave function @xmath16 is expanded in a molecular basis by @xmath17 with @xmath0 the size of the basis or total number of channels .",
    "the asymptotic states are defined by the ti schrdinger equation @xmath18 resulting in @xmath0 coupled equations for the expansion coefficients @xmath19 with @xmath20 the potential matrix in the basis of states @xmath21 @xmath22 in the born - oppenheimer approximation , @xmath20 are the usual electronic potentials which are diagonal in the adiabatic representation , and non - diagonal , but real and symmetric in the diabatic representation applied here .    in a semiclassical approach ,",

    "while for single channel calculations ( i.e. , @xmath80 ) there is no ambiguity in equation  ( [ velocityint ] ) , for multichannel cases , the @xmath81 term has presented a theoretical dilemma for many decades .",
    "@xmath81 must be replaced by some superposition , @xmath82 , over all channel diagonal diabatic potentials , but the exact prescription is unknown . a number of authors @xcite have proposed various schemes including : ( i ) an arithmetic average , ( ii ) a geometric average , or ( iii ) setting @xmath82 equal to the @xmath83 of an individual channel . we find that the probabilities and cross sections computed by any of these schemes are practically indistinguishable down to a kinetic energy of @xmath840.1 kev .",
    "in fact , delos et al @xcite suggested that the exact averaging prescription is unimportant as long as some type of averaging is taken into account , as illustrated in figures  [ vint2]-[potentialavg1 ] . for energies less",
    "than @xmath840.1 kev , figure  [ potentialavg2 ] shows some dispersion of the cross sections for different averaging schemes , but in this energy regime the cross sections become very small .",
    "nevertheless , the arithmetic and geometric approaches give similar results and therefore we default to an arithmetic average of all channels for @xmath82 .",
    "the application of potential averaging is clearly not a robust theoretical procedure and in fact introduces a problem in which the principle of detailed balance , @xmath85 may be violated @xcite .",
    "this deficiency becomes worse with decreasing collision energy thereby limiting the applicability of the scmocc method .",
    "billing @xcite has proposed a correction by introducing a so - called symmetrized ehrenfest approach .",
    "the method , which is not related to ehrenfest s theorems , shifts the relative velocity for a given initial channel and has been shown to give reliable cross sections for a variety of collision systems @xcite .",
    "we apply it here as a post - processing algorithm which redefines the kinetic energy @xmath86 of the collision system . for a 2-state case",
    ", the kinetic energy is redefined according to @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the redefined kinetic energy .",
    "it is presumed to be valid for @xmath89 .",

    "the former is larger than the uncorrected case for inelastic transitions below 10 kev with the difference increasing with decreasing @xmath86 . in summary , explicitly solving for the relative velocity as a function of time with arithmetic - averaged multichannel potentials and a post - processing shift of the kinetic energy via the symmetrized ehrenfest approach should allow the scmocc method to be applied to compute cross sections for kinetic energies a factor @xmath84100 smaller than with the straight line , constant velocity approximation , that is , approaching kinetic energies as low as 1 ev .     +",
