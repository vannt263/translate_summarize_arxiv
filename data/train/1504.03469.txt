    "the study of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons using the _ planck _ @xcite and bicep2 @xcite data sets has opened up a new constraint on inflationary models  @xcite . specifically , the detailed analysis of _ planck _ data  @xcite constrains single scalar - field models of slow - roll inflation , to have very low tensor - to - scalar fluctuation ratio @xmath0 , with a scalar spectral index @xmath1 possessing no appreciable running . the upper bound set by the _ planck _ collaboration  @xcite on tensor - to - scalar fluctuation ratio , related to the absence of the b - modes of polarization in the cmb , is @xmath2 , but their favored regions ( higher than 95% c.l . )",
    "point towards a more stringent bound of @xmath3 . from the theoretical view point one can see that this is in agreement with the so - called starobinsky - type ( or @xmath4 , with @xmath5 denoting the scalar space - time curvature ) inflationary models  @xcite .",
    "last year , however , the bicep2 team  @xcite made an important claim : to have made the first measurement of b - mode polarization in the cmb radiation .",
    "this measurement was initially interpreted as indication for gravitational waves at the time of the last scattering , with a tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath6 .",
    "if such claims were confirmed , they would constitute the first experimental observation of ( transverse ) primordial ( possibly quantum ) metric fluctuations .",
    "for the scalar spectal index , it has been found that @xmath1 and @xmath7 , in agreement with the _ planck _ data  @xcite .    since",
    "then a great effort has been spent in order to compare the bicep2 tensor - to - scalar ratio against the choice of inflationary paradigm ( @xmath4 @xcite , chaotic @xcite , inverse power law @xcite , hilltop @xcite , natural @xcite , supersymmetry @xcite , d - flation @xcite and the like ) .",
    "furthermore , during this period there was an intense debate as to whether the bicep2 signal is indubitably due to primordial gravitational waves , or is polluted by gravitationally - lensed e - modes and galactic foregrounds .",
    "recently , in  ref . @xcite it was stressed that magnetized dust associated with radio loops due to supernova remnants might affect the signal received by bicep2 . in the case of polarization effects by galactic dust , refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite have shown that the cosmological value of tensor - to - scalar ratio could be very small @xmath8 . within this framework ,",
    "the recent analysis on the foreground dust in the bicep2 region released by the _ planck _ collaboration  @xcite points to a significant foreground pollution which means that the bicep2 b - mode polarization data can not be used as evidence for primordial cmb polarization .",
    "recently , the joint analysis of bicep2/keck array and _ planck _ data appeared in the literature @xcite . this analysis has placed an upper bound in the tensor - to - scalar ratio , namely @xmath9 at @xmath10 significance level . in this context , the planck team has repeated the inflationary analysis by using the _ planck 2015 _ data and essentially confirm the _",
    "planck 2013 _ results : @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the crux of these studies is that the potential energy of the scalar field , is not really known and one must introduce it using phenomenological arguments , starting with the simplest possibilities .",
    "there has been intense debate and speculation about the functional form of the potential energy @xmath13 .",
    "various candidates have been proposed in the literature , such as a power law , inverse power law , exponential and so on ( for review see @xcite and references therein ) but exact solutions are not abundant and always possess special mathematical features .",
    "some time ago , a special solution for a spatially flat friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) spacetime with a perfect fluid with a constant equation of state parameter * * @xmath14 * * ( where , for radiation @xmath15 and for dust @xmath16 ) and a scalar field with a constant equation of state @xmath17 was found in @xcite .",
    "in particular , rubano and barrow @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) showed that under of specific conditions we can solve the einstein equations when the potential @xmath13 has the interesting hyperbolic form : @xmath18   ^{b } , \\label{pot}\\ ] ] where the constant @xmath19 is @xmath20 and @xmath21 note that @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the usual cosmological parameters ( although @xmath23 denotes any possible matter content according to the appropriate choice of @xmath24 ) . if we trace the late universe ( dustlike matter @xmath25 ) we have @xmath16 .",
    "we remind the reader that @xmath26 denotes the equation of state parameter of the dark energy usually parametrized by @xmath27 , with @xmath28 and @xmath29 being the pressure and density of the dark energy fluid .",
    "obviously the exponent @xmath30 plays an important role in the cosmic dynamics , since it is related with the equation of state parameter , @xmath26 . in this context , inverting eq.([bb ] ) one can prove that the equation of state parameter reduces to @xmath31 .",
    "note that the accelerated expansion of the universe poses the restriction @xmath32 which implies @xmath33 , where @xmath34 .",
    "the potential ( [ pot ] ) has some interesting geometric characteristics . under specific conditions",
    ", it behaves either as an exponential or as a power - law . if @xmath35 ( or @xmath36 ) , we find @xmath37 ( or @xmath38 ) , where @xmath39 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the initial motivation in @xcite was to use potential ( [ pot ] ) to describe the late - time acceleration of the universe , but we can also apply eq.([pot ] ) to the very early states of the cosmic evolution when the cosmic fluid is dominated by the radiation and the inflaton components . *",
    "* this might then provide a unified picture of inflation and dark energy in which both eras are described by the potential of eq.([pot ] ) .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to demonstrate compatibility of the rubano and barrow @xcite scenario with the _ planck 2015 _ data , taking into account the foreground ambiguities clouding the _ planck 2015 _ data , as mentioned previously .",

    "recall that in the dark - energy era the corresponding constants are related with the cosmological parameters [ see eqs.([aa ] ) and ( [ bb ] ) ] .",
    "therefore , in the early universe one may expect that the corresponding constants in eq.([pot1 ] ) are not necessarily equal to those derived by @xcite using arguments from the late universe where pressureless matter dominates radiation ( for comparison with the observational data see @xcite ) .",
    "when radiation dominates we have @xmath15 and so from the second equality of eq.([bb ] ) we arrive at @xmath58 note that the restriction @xmath59 implies that the potential contains a critical point .    now inserting eq.([pot1 ] ) into the slow - roll parameters we obtain after some simple algebra @xmath60@xmath61 , \\label{nn1}\\]]@xmath62   .",

    "\\label{efold2}\\ ] ] in order to proceed with the analysis we need to know the values of @xmath70 and @xmath53 .",
    "firstly , it is natural to consider that the number of e - folds lies in the interval @xmath71 $ ] . here",
    ", we set it to 55 , for concreteness .",
    "secondly , using the constraint @xmath54 and eq.([ee1 ] ) we can estimate the value of the scalar field at the end of inflation to be @xmath72 where @xmath73 .",
    "since @xmath74 the scale @xmath56 obeys the restriction @xmath75 .",
    "the point of this section is to test the viability of the potential ( [ pot1 ] ) at the inflationary level , involving the latest cosmological data . in particular , the combined analysis between _",
    "planck 2015 _ and various data such as wmap , high-@xmath76 data , and baryonic acoustic oscillations ( bao ) , shows that the scalar spectral index is @xmath11 .",
    "for the scalar spectral index in this work we use @xmath77 .",
    "furthermore , as mentioned in the introduction , the analysis of the _ planck _ collaboration places an upper limit on the tensor - to - scalar ratio is concerned , @xmath78 which is in agreement with the joint analysis of bicep2/keck array and _ planck _ @xcite .",
    "let us now briefly present our results .",
    "in figures 1 and 2 we show the confidence contours in the @xmath79 and @xmath80 planes which are provided by the planck team @xcite . on top of",
    "that we present the area for the individual sets of @xmath79 which are based on the potential ( [ pot1 ] ) , whereas in figure 2 we display the corresponding area in the case of @xmath80 . obviously , our results are consistent with those of _",
    "planck 2015_. specifically , as it can be seen from figure 1 , the tensor - to - scalar fluctuation ratio could reach the value of @xmath81 which is in a good agreement within @xmath82 with that of bicep2/keck array/_planck _ results ( @xmath83 see figure 9 in @xcite ) .",
    "notice that in order to derive @xmath84 the constants in eq.([pot1 ] ) need to obey the following inequalities : @xmath85 [ or inverting eq.([bbw ] ) we obtain @xmath86 and @xmath87 . concerning the running spectral index we obtain @xmath88 which is consistent with that of _ planck 2015 _ , namely @xmath77 .",
    "moreover , we find that the running of the scalar spectral index does not change significantly as a function of @xmath89 ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "regarding the inflaton field at the beginning of inflation , we obtain @xmath90 ; while at the end of inflation we require @xmath91 .",
    "furthermore , we find that the allowed region in which our results satisfy the @xmath92 observational restrictions of _ planck 2015 _ is @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "thus the data applied to slow - roll inflation place constraints on @xmath30 , although the value of scale @xmath56 has only a lower limit at @xmath92 level .",
    "finally , we would like to compare our results with those found using other potentials . specifically , in the case of the chaotic inflation @xmath95 @xcite , the corresponding slow - roll parameters are written as @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "the latter implies @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 . using @xmath102 and @xmath40 we obtain @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "this also corresponds to the slow - roll regime of intermediate inflation @xcite with hubble rate during inflation given by @xmath106with @xmath107 and @xmath108 gives @xmath109 exactly to first order and @xmath110 . on the other hand the starobinsky inflation @xcite",
    ", namely @xmath111 $ ] , leads to the following slow - roll predictions @xcite : @xmath112 and @xmath113 , where @xmath114 .",
    "furthermore , for starobinsky inflation following the notations of @xcite we find that the running spectral index is given by @xmath115 . to this end using @xmath40 we obtain @xmath116 .",
    "the above slow - roll parameters are indicated by the solid points ( chaotic inflation ) in figures 1 and 2 while the stars represent values for the starobinsky inflation . _  _",
    "in the light of the _ planck 2015 _ results , a debate is taking place in the literature about the best implementation of the inflationary paradigm . in the current article",
    "we would like to contribute to this discussion . employing the hyperbolic dark - energy scalar - field potential of rubano and barrow @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) we study the performance of this model as a description of inflation .",
    "we find that the hyperbolic inflation turns out to be quite promising in the context of the new data from _",
    "planck 2015_. specifically , using the scalar - field potential ( [ pot1 ] ) , we calculate the slow - roll parameters analytically and then we compare the corresponding predictions against the observational data .",
    "we find that currently hyperbolic inflation is consistent with the results provided by _",
    "planck 2015 _ within @xmath82 uncertainties .",
    "the combination of ref @xcite with these calculations provide an overall cosmological investigation of the potential given by eq.([pot1 ] ) .",
    "we find that the hyperbolic structure of this potential leads to a viable model which can be used separately to understand the main properties of both inflation and dark energy in the presence of a single perfect fluid .",
    "finally , following the notations of @xcite we can provide a unified picture of dark energy and inflation using the sum of the potentials ( [ pot ] ) and ( [ pot1 ] ) @xmath117   + a\\;\\mathrm{sinh}^{b}(\\phi / f)\\ ] ] where @xmath118 and the constants @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath30 , are given by eqs.([aa ] ) , ( [ bb ] ) and ( [ bbw ] ) .",
