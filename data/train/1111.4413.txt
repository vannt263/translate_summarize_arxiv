    "young stars are not only shaped by their natal environments but shape it in return .",
    "they are responsible for triggering further generations of star formation , ablating the circumstellar disks of their lower mass neighbours , clearing gas and dust in parsec - scale cavities surrounding them , and altering the processing of dust grains in the intercluster medium",
    ". observations of young clusters in the infrared ( ir ) and x - ray have been combined to allow the identification of the stellar population in these regions from the most massive down to the substellar @xcite .",
    "such surveys indicate that perhaps more than 60% of young stars form in clusters @xcite .",
    "our own sun is thought to have formed in a massive cluster and have assimilated material ( such as @xmath4 and other short - live nucleotides ) from a near - by supernova @xcite .",
    "the study of the effects of high mass stars in star forming regions is thus of great importance in the understanding of both the large scale development of clusters and of the smaller scale evolution of planetary systems around lower mass sun - like stars .",
    "such studies indicate that the sub - structure within these sites of star formation is complex and this can have an impact on the natal environment of individual stars .",
    "nearby regions of high mass star formation have recently been shown to exhibit varying spatial morphologies , such as the compact spherical structure of tr  15 @xcite or the subclustered tr  16 @xcite , where the clusters are contigous and show no sign of mass segregation .",
    "rcw  38 itself shows evidence for at least four subclusters which are more loosely associated than those of tr  16 and show indications of mass segregation in the central subcluster but not in the surrounding subclusters . by studying a number of high mass clusters",
    "we can better understand how the spatial distribution of young stars and their exposure to photo - ionising radiation can affect the fomation and evolution of young stars and their planets .",
    "one way that massive stars interact with their environment is through strong stellar winds .",
    "these winds can clear gas from their environs and in so doing generate shocks where the high velocity outflowing gas intersects with the ambient interstellar / cluster medium or with the winds from other local massive stars @xcite .",
    "termination shocks arise where the stellar wind terminates as it is balanced by the ram pressure from the interstellar medium ( ism ) or the wind from a local massive star .",
    "if the relative velocites of the star and ism / wind are large the shocked material is swept backwards around the star forming a bow shock. the orientation of the bow shock and its stand - off distance , the distance from the generating star to shock , are determined mainly by the the velocity of the driving star and its wind , and the flow of the ism or massive star wind .",
    "parsec scale collimated outflows ( jets ) from young protostars entrain surrounding gas and dust and can disrupt their parent clouds , perhaps triggering star formation in regions where over densities are generated or bringing it to an end by removing the gas from which young stars form .",
    "massive stars with their strong stellar winds are particularly effective in this regard , but herbig aebe and t tauri stars are also known to drive outflows .",
    "such outflows are usually identified in the visible and near - ir as herbig - haro ( hh ) objects or knots of roughly symmetric emission around a yso @xcite .",
    "x - ray emission from jets has also been observed , e.g. in dg tau @xcite and l1551 irs  5 @xcite",
    ". the lifetimes of these jets are short , typically @xmath110@xmath5  yr .",
    "they are typically most active during the high accretion protostellar phase , but can continue into the class ii phase .",
    "the knots of emission may be linked to episodic accretion @xcite .",
    "recently , observations of cluster populations in the mid - ir with @xmath6 have identified emission from outflows , hh - objects and bow shocks in star forming regions .",
    "@xcite report the identification using the _ spitzer _ glimpse survey data , of six bow shocks in two massive star forming regions , m17 and rcw49 .",
    "@xcite have modeled emission from six hh - objects over the irac bands and have found that the emission is mainly due to h@xmath7 emission and unlikely to have significant contributions from h  i , [ fe  ii ] , fluorescent h@xmath7 , or pah emission . the hh objects",
    "hh 54 and hh 7 - 11 have been the subject of a recent study by @xcite with @xmath6 irs that mapped emission from rotational lines of molecular hydrogen ( associated with the irac bandpasses ) and fine structure transitions of ions such as fe@xmath8 ( associated with the mips 24  @xmath0 bandpass ) .",
    "the authors found that the h@xmath7 emission was consistent with nondissociative shocks with velocities of @xmath9 and the fine structure emission with faster shocks with velocities of @xmath10 offset from the slower shocks , indicating that shocks detected at 24  @xmath0 may be faster dissociative shocks than those detected in the irac bandpasses only .",
    "bow shocks have also been considered as indicators for run - away o - stars in young massive clusters @xcite .",
    "the orientation of their bow shocks relative to the cluster , pointing away from its centre , implies the star has a velocity which is taking it out of the cluster .",
    "such observations indicate that the o - stars in question form centrally and their current trajectories arise from dynamical interactions in the cluster centre @xcite .",
    "the rcw 38 cluster is a region of high mass star formation , lying at a distance of about 1.7  kpc from earth .",
    "the region is one of the closest high mass star forming regions known , and contains an estimated @xmath11 to @xmath12 members , including more than thirty o star candidates @xcite .",
    "an extensive overview of the previous studies of rcw  38 is to be found in the handbook of star formation article on the cluster @xcite .",
    "the massive star candidates are spatially distributed throughout the observed region but are concentrated in four subclusters .",
    "the central subcluster of rcw  38 is dominated by two bright mid - ir sources : the o5.5 binary irs  2 and the bright emission ridge irs  1 @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggest that the central region is a cavity blown by the wind from the irs  2 binary and that irs  1 is a ridge of material swept into a shell around irs  2 .    in our previous paper on the rcw  38 region",
    ", @xcite[hereafter referred to as @xmath13 , we presented mid - ir observations taken with @xmath6 irac & mips combined with @xmath14 archival data . in this paper",
    "we will report on the identification of five bow shocks surrounding ysos in the rcw  38 star forming region .",
    "we will then discuss the larger scale evolution of the cluster due to the winds and/or novae of massive stars in the central subcluster .",
    "lastly we will discuss the embedded cluster to the ne of rcw  38 : dbs2003 - 124 , first identified in a survey for new ir clusters in 2mass by @xcite , and a newly identified protostellar jet associated with a young star in that cluster .",
    "the observations and data reduction for the @xmath6 and @xmath14 data were presented in @xmath15 and @xcite .",
    "a brief summary of that work is presented here .",
    "we obtained observations of the rcw  38 region with the _ spitzer _ infrared array camera ( irac ; @xcite ) in four wavelength bands : 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0  @xmath16 m and with the multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ ( mips ) @xcite .",
    "this photometry was supplemented by @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19-band photometry from the 2mass point source catalogue @xcite .",
    "the infrared observations were further combined with _",
    "advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ; @xcite ) x - ray data .    in @xmath15",
    "we identified 624 young stellar objects in rcw 38 , of which , 226 were detected in x - rays with _",
    "the ysos were of the following evolutionary classes @xcite : 23 class i , 90 flat spectrum , 437 class ii , and 74 class iii . of the ysos ,",
    "9 class i , 18 flat spectrum , 125 class ii , and 74 class iii were also detected in the _ chandra _ x - ray observation .",
    "the spatial distribution was studied using yso density maps and minimum spanning - tree techniques and found to show evidence of three subclusters surrounding the central irs2 subcluster .",
    "one of these subclusters is obj-36 @xcite associated with the reflection nebula vdbh - rn43 @xcite and has now been identified as a subcluster of the rcw  38 complex .",
    "we found that the observed relationship of @xmath20/@xmath21 was consistent with the @xcite ratio of @xmath22 for the local ism and nearby molecular clouds .",
    "an examination of photometric variance identified 72 variable sources , with variables in each of the subclusters and in the dispersed population .",
    "using near - ir color - magnitude criteria , 29 candidate o stars were identified .",
    "these were also distributed across the extended rcw  38 region , with massive stars associated with each of the subclusters .",
    "the bow shocks identified in this paper have an extended geometry such that their fluxes could not be obtained using the point source extraction methods applied to the stellar sources in @xmath15 .",
    "the flux apertures were constructed manually to most accurately enclose the shock on the image .",
    "the area of each bow shock was estimated using an irregular polygonal aperture in @xmath23 @xcite and the flux estimated using @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the same aperture was used at each irac band , being defined in the band where emission in that shock was strongest and best defined , and then replicated at each wavelength .",
    "the background sky emission was estimated and removed by taking the flux in an adjacent rectangular aperture and scaling to the area of the shock aperture .",
    "the 24  @xmath0 bow shock fluxes were estimated using @xmath24 , similarly to the irac fluxes , using the same irregular polygonal aperture used in the irac bands where the shock was detected .",
    "in rcw  38 we identify five bow shocks in highly differing environments .",
    "the coordinates and photometry for the five driving stars are given in table  [ tablestars ] .",
    "their individual identifiers correspond to the @xmath6 ids listed in table  2 of @xmath15 , where their evolutionary classification and variability over our two epochs of irac observations were determined .",
    "the coordinates of the apexes of the bow shocks and their estimated fluxes are listed in table  [ tableshocks ] .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] presents an irac false - color image of the rcw  38 cluster with the locations of the five identified shocks highlighted .",
    "the bow shocks are clearly visible in shocked hydrogen emission , seen predominantly at 4.5@xmath0 ( in green ) .",
    "pah emission from heated dust is visible at 8.0@xmath0 .",
    "the region of bright yellow emission to the west of centre in the image is the central subcluster of rcw  38 where irs  1 & 2 are located .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] provides irac and mips false - color enlarged images of each of the five identified shocks and their driving stars . the upper two plots ( yso  293 & yso  49 ) show the bow shocks clearly visible in shocked hydrogen at 4.5@xmath0 . the shocks in the central plots ( yso  129 & yso  803 ) emit predominantly at 24@xmath0 , indicating perhaps faster dissociative shocks @xcite . the lower plot shows yso  581 , which is seen as a faint emission feature against irs  1 , the bright x - shaped emission feature to the ne of the shock in the centre of the image .",
    "irs  2 is the bright blue source to the e of irs  1 .",
    "details on the individual driving stars and bow shocks can be found in the appendix .",
    "the near- and mid - ir fluxes were used to construct spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for the five driving stars and bow shocks , with the plots of the seds given in fig .  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the star symbols show the stellar fluxes while the squares indicate the fluxes of the shocks .",
    "the shock fluxes of yso  803 and yso  129 are very faint shortwards of 24@xmath0 and so the irac fluxes are not greatly in excess of the background and are more uncertain .",
    "both the stellar and shock fluxes from yso  581 are contaminated by the superposition of the shock and star due to the line of sight .",
    "the objects yso  581 , yso  293 , and yso  49 were classified as c0/i and ii sources as their stellar seds exhibit excess emission above that of a stellar photosphere .",
    "the seds of the bow shocks are consistent with emission from a black body .",
    "these findings are consistent with those of shocks in rcw49 and m17 presented by @xcite , and by @xcite in the orion nebular cluster .",
    "the onc is relatively nearby at a distance of 145  pc , m17 lies at a similar distance ( 1.5  kpc ) to rcw  38 , while the distance to rcw  49 is given as 4.2 or 6  kpc in @xcite .",
    "the five rcw  38 shocks increase the number of known mid - ir shocks by @xmath140% and more than double the known sample at 1 - 2  kpc .",
    "consideration of the stand - off distance of the bow shock ( the distance from the star to the apex of the shock ) and the mass loss rate of the driving star can lead to an estimation of the relative velocity of the stellar winds or ism in the region . from @xcite , following the normalisation of @xcite , we have an equation relating the velocity ( @xmath25 ) and hydrogen particle density ( @xmath26 ) of the ambient medium to the mass loss rate ( @xmath27 ) and relative velocity ( @xmath28 ) of the driving star and the bow shock stand - off distance ( @xmath29 ) @xmath30 the stand - off distance must incorporate a @xmath31 term since we can not ascertain the angle of the shock with respect to the plane of the sky .",
    "however , @xmath31 has a mean value of 0.9 for angles between 0@xmath32 and 45@xmath32 so this will affect the resulting velocity measurement at the 10% level .",
    "the density of the ism is assumed to be approximately @xmath33 , and hence equal to unity in the equation .",
    "the mass loss rates and stellar wind velocities from young massive stars are highly variable and strongly dependent on stellar spectral type @xcite .",
    "this uncertainty is further complicated by the estimation of the spectral type , which is calculated from the near - ir colors and not spectroscopy . in this case a value of @xmath340.2@xmath35 is applied to all stars with spectral type later than o9 applicable to all five objects in this case .",
    "this value is based on estimates taken from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a thorough description of the assumptions made in this calculation is presented in @xcite .",
    "the offset in pixels from the coordinates of the star to the apex of the bow shock was measured on the 8  @xmath0 mosaic and converted to distance in parsecs assuming a distance to rcw  38 of 1.7  kpc .",
    "the spectral types of the driving stars were estimated from their positions on the @xmath19 v. @xmath36 color - magnitude diagram .",
    "the spectral types , stand - off distances and estimates of the relative velocity for the shocks are given in table  [ tableprops ] , except yso 581 , the geometry of which precludes the measurement of the stand - off distance . with the caveat that the values of @xmath37 are highly uncertain we can say that in the cases of the four shocks with measurements the velocities span a small range , from 4 - 12  @xmath38 .",
    "the velocities calculated for sources 129 and 803 , those only visible at longer wavelengths , are somewhat lower than those of the sources with shocks clearly visible in the irac bands .",
    "this would not agree with their emission arising from fast dissociative shocks and is perhaps an indication that these more outlying sources are located in a lower density medium .",
    "it may also be linked to evolutionary classification : both are class iii sources .",
    "it may also be related to their being shocked by the ism and not due to interaction with wind from high mass stars .",
    "the orientations of all five bow shocks in rcw  38 appear to be aligned with o - star candidates identified in their vicinity .",
    "none of the five shocks are oriented such that their driving stars would appear to be following a trajectory away from irs  2 .",
    "this allows us to rule out the possibility that the stars driving the bow shocks are run away o - stars that are being ejected from the central subcluster .",
    "ysos 293 and 49 are aligned to oc15-v13 ( see table 11 in @xmath15 ) , while the apex of the central bow shock is clearly pointing towards the central o5.5 binary irs2 .",
    "this orientation indicates that the shock is @xmath39 sw of the binary and also perhaps @xmath40 behind the o stars .",
    "this would imply that the o star binary is not clearing out a cylindrical structure as this is a projection effect and these walls lie behind the massive stars .",
    "their winds are likely compressing and illuminating the posterior wall of the h@xmath7 blister bubble . in the case of yso 129 and yso  803",
    "the source of the interaction is less clear ; it may be the candidate o - star ne20 , associated with the new subcluster , c.f .",
    "however it is more likely that they trace the direction of the flow of the ism material in their vicinity , implying that this material is moving in a roughly e to w direction across the face of the cluster .",
    "discussion of the central o stars of irs  2 leads to an examination of the overal structure of rcw  38 and the effect of the massive stars and their winds on the evolution of the cluster .",
    "in planetary nebulae , complex x - ray emission structures have been observed which show both evidence of axial symmetry and an anticorrelation between the x - ray diffuse emission and the infrared extinction , indicating that the x - ray outflows can in part be shaped by the material into which they expand ( cf : * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "similar features have also been observed in the centre of rcw  38 .",
    "the two o5.5 stars of irs  2 have an estimated combined luminosity @xmath41 of 5.71  @xmath42 and hydrogen ionising photon flux @xmath43 of 49.4 @xcite and are considered likely to be the main drivers of the outflows from the central subcluster .",
    "@xcite modelled the diffuse x - ray emission and found it was best fit by synchotron emission .",
    "we infer from the orientation of the central bow shock of yso  581 , that the central o - stars of irs  2 are not hemmed in by the dense dust and gas structures of irs  1 and surrounding rim of material .",
    "rather , they may be some distance in front of the face of the molecular cloud , perhaps @xmath10.3  pc , ( the radius of a sphere centred on irs  2 and defined by the rim of emission at 8  @xmath0 at the assumed distance to rcw  38 of 1.7kpc ) .",
    "the outflows and stellar winds from these stars have been been funnelled outwards in three outflows along a ne - sw axis and to the nw , evacuating the region and heating the gas and dust along the path as they are swept up in the moving shock front .",
    "further , the orientation of the outflow is possibly tilted with respect to the plane of the sky , with the sw lobe projecting out of the plane by a few degrees , while the ne lobe is projected into the molecular cloud in front of which the cluster sits .",
    "the southern lobe has met with less dense material at the border of the molecular cloud and ism .",
    "this material is being shocked where the hot ionised gas of the expanding shell collides with it , as can be seen in fig .",
    "the hot gas can be observed in the x - ray contours shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , filling the expanding cavity cleared by the outflow .",
    "the leading shock front is visible at 4.5  @xmath0 as shocked hydrogen emission and also via the heated dust visible at 24  @xmath0 , c.f .",
    "[ fig5 ] & [ fig6 ] .",
    "the expanding flow of hot ionised gas to the nw visible in the x - ray data has caused shocked emission in the ir as it collides with and flows around the dust and gas .",
    "the third outflow , expanding to the ne , appears to be moving into a region of higher dust density and appears to be partially obscured by a ridge of dense dust .",
    "these outflows may have triggered the latest generation of star formation in the central subcluster , as can be traced by the filament of protostars , illustrated in fig .",
    "the ysos shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , identified in @xmath15 , are the class 0/i ( circles ) and flat spectrum sources ( triangles ) .",
    "while the class 0/i protostars are located throughout the region , they are notably concentrated in discreet groups in the three outer subclusters and within the central irs  2 subcluster where they form an filament or arc - shaped distribution .",
    "the protostars in this filament are also spatially coincident with a ridge of dust emission observed at 1.2 mm @xcite",
    ".    outside of the central subcluster , the molecular cloud is also being shaped by other massive stars .",
    "a dense pillar of dust is being carved away by the photo - evaporating winds of yso  129 ( one of the bow shock driving stars ) and possibly the o - star candidate ov15-v13 , c.f .",
    "[ fig1 ] and for an expanded view fig .",
    "these two stars lie at projected distances from the top of the pillar of 1.37 and 4.94 arcmin ( 0.68 and 2.44  pc ) for yso  129 and ov15-v13 , respectively .",
    "the pillar has a finger of dense material extending from it in the sw direction and two illuminated faces to sw and w. the faces and finger of the pillar show very bright emission at 4.5 , 8.0 and 24@xmath16 m implying both heating of the dust and shocked gas emission .",
    "no point sources are detected in the pillar .",
    "this is perhaps because the density is currently too low to promote star formation or because any protostars within are as yet too young to be detected in the near- to mid - ir and would require observations at longer wavelengths , such as are available with herschel or with ground - based submm instruments .",
    "six of the candidate o stars are located on the periphery of the central subcluster .",
    "if these stars are early type members , then the surrounding low to intermediate mass ysos that have some shielding from the irs  2 binary would be exposed to higher fluxes of ionising photons than might otherwise have been expected .",
    "this may have an impact on the x - ray calculated yso disk fraction ( the ratio of x - ray detected class ii to class iii ) which was found to be constant with radial distance beyond @xmath10.5pc from the central irs  2 binary . within a radial distance of irs  2 of 0.5pc",
    "the ratio is @xmath44 ; this rises to 67@xmath455% beyond a radius of 0.5pc and is approximately constant from 0.5 - 3pc from the centre of the subcluster . while the uncertainties do overlap ( due to the small sample in the central region ) , there is an indication that the disk fraction is decreased in the vicinity of irs  2 .",
    "the three other subclusters each contain a candidate massive star , and while not as early as irs  2 they are still capable of affecting the circumstellar disks of their subcluster members .",
    "the majority of the candidates are strewn throughout the distributed population and thus it may be difficult to identify any significant fraction of the population of the extended rcw  38 region that is isolated from the effects of a massive star .",
    "the embedded stellar cluster dbs2003 - 124 was identified by @xcite in a survey of the 2mass catalogue designed to identify new ir clusters .",
    "located at coordinates @xmath46 , @xmath47 , 16.9 ne of irs",
    "2 , it lies close to edge of the irac image and was only observed in the 3.6 & 5.8@xmath0 bands due to the offset in the fields of view of the irac channels .",
    "the cluster was also observed in the mips 24@xmath0 image , c.f .",
    "visually , the region appears to be contiguous with rcw  38 , the cloud material and ysos extending without interruption between this cluster and the subclusters associated with rcw  38 itself ; therefore we assume the distance to also be 1.7kpc . at this distance",
    "it lies 8.4pc in projection from irs  2 .",
    "the cluster is surrounded by a ridge of bright emission at 5.8@xmath0 , within which are located tens of point sources , including one very bright 24@xmath0 detection in the centre of the grouping and another 24@xmath0 source on the ne of the central group .",
    "a string of five 24@xmath0 point sources is observed , two within the ridge of dust emission and a tail of three more sources extending to the sw , one of which appears to be the origin of the protostellar jet .",
    "the projected separations of these five objects is semi - regular from the northernmost source to the south : 0.26pc , 0.43pc , 0.27pc , 0.42pc .",
    "the southern most of the five 24@xmath0 sources , ne20 , is a candidate high mass star , and it is located 1.16  pc from the subcluster centre .",
    "this would make dbs2003 - 124 the only one of the five identified subclusters without an o - star at its centre .",
    "unlike obj  36 , the nw subcluster identified in @xmath15 , there is no bright mid - ir emission nebula associated with this small cluster of stars .",
    "the region also exhibits faint extended emission at 24@xmath0 and is the only subcluster where 24@xmath0 point sources are identified ( though both the central subcluster and obj  36 are saturated in the 24@xmath0 mosaic ) .",
    "two methods were used to identify candidate members of the cluster . in the first method ,",
    "those sources within the ridge of dust surrounding the main 24@xmath0 source and the 24@xmath0 sources themselves were considered to be members of the cluster and their coordinates and photometry are included in table  [ tablencphot1 ] .",
    "this method identified 14 possible members from the 3.6 and 5.8@xmath0 photometry , with the five at 24@xmath0 .",
    "the second method involved searching for sources with excess emission on the [ 3.6 ] v. [ 3.6 - 5.8 ] color - magnitude diagram in the region surrounding the cluster and 24@xmath0 filament . with this method",
    ", we identify 17 objects , including 11 new possible cluster members .",
    "the coordinates and photometry of the sources identified using the cmd are presented in table  [ tablencphot2 ] .",
    "this gives an estimated membership of 33 objects in dbs2003 - 124 .",
    "high resolution imaging of the cluster in the near - ir would allow for a better estimate of the total population of this young cluster .",
    "figure  [ fig7 ] also reveals two aligned shells of mir emission , which appear to be shocked emission from two infrared candidate hh objects in a westward moving protostellar jet .",
    "tracing the outflow backwards leads to the young star ne21 , one of the 24@xmath0 sources in the filament extending from dbs2003 - 124 .",
    "this star also may have an extended emission feature at 5.8@xmath0 , which might trace the beginnings of the protostellar jet and indicating that the jet remains active , though this feature may be also be a data processing artifact .",
    "the coordinates of the apexes of the two shells are : @xmath48,@xmath49 and @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "these are found at distances from ne21 of 1.85pc and 3.16pc , respectively , assuming a distance of 1.7kpc . by considering a range of velocities for the material in the jet",
    ", we can estimate the age of the jet from the two identified shells . in table",
    "[ jet ] , we list the ages of the jet assuming velocities of 10 , 100 and 500  kms@xmath52 @xcite .",
    "we estimate the age of the jet to be @xmath53 to @xmath54 years .",
    "this would imply a very young age for this star and the subcluster as a whole .",
    "it is possible that this subcluster is younger than rcw  38 itself and that star formation is progressing through the molecular cloud .",
    "we have examined the rcw  38 cluster using mid - ir observations taken with the _ spitzer _ space telescope s irac and mips instruments and discovered five bow shocks in the region .",
    "we have combined these data with 2mass photometry and _ chandra _ observations to classify the evolutionary stage of the driving stars and to estimate their spectral type .",
    "we have examined the large scale outflow from the central subcluster to study its effects on the evolution of the cluster as a whole , in particular its star formation history .",
    "we have also identified dbs2003 - 124 as a embedded mid - ir subcluster most likely associated with rcw  38 and two candidate hh - objects from a jet originating from a yso within this subcluster .",
    "the main results from our study are :    * five bowshocks were detected by their mid - ir emission in the irac and mips bandpasses .",
    "the shocks are associated with driving stars with estimated spectral types from o9-b3 , based on their near - ir magnitudes and colors .",
    "four of the driving stars are previously identified ysos , with one class i , two class ii and one class iii objects .",
    "the fifth driving star was classified as being class iii .",
    "three of the bow shocks are clearly visible in the irac images , two are only clearly detected at 24  @xmath0 . *",
    "the relative velocities of the shocks were estimated from the stand - off distance of the shocks to their associated stars and their estimated mass loss rates and stellar wind velocities .",
