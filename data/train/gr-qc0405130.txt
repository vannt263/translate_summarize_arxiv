    "in the area of self - gravitating systems , the literature often gives the impression that the long - range properties of forces are the cause of negative specific heat in such systems .",
    "here , we will show that only some systems affected by long - range forces exhibit negative specific heat .",
    "we limit our investigations to potentials of the form @xmath7 and of the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the radial coordinate in a space with @xmath0 dimensions ( @xmath10 ) , @xmath2 an integer ( @xmath11 ) , and @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 constants ( only depending on @xmath0 and @xmath2 ) .",
    "observe that gravitation is described by ( [ 188 ] ) for @xmath15 , and by ( [ 301 ] ) for @xmath16 .",
    "we will , however , to extend the analysis , regard both ( [ 188 ] ) and ( [ 301 ] ) for any @xmath10 .",
    "we can use spaces with @xmath10 and @xmath11 as our theoretical `` test bench '' to investigate the cause of negative specific heat .",
    "there is , for instance , no a priori reason why long - range forces should result in negative specific heat in three dimensions , but not in other number of dimensions .",
    "if this happens only in three dimensions , there is probably another mechanism laying behind , that is more relevant to explain negative specific heat .    before investigating negative specific heat",
    ", we will define the concept of long- range and short - range forces .",
    "let us regard a continuous medium with constant density , and investigate from which areas of the medium the main part of the potential energy of a particle embedded in the medium comes .",
    "short - range forces are , for potentials of the form ( [ 188 ] ) , then characterised by @xmath17 and long - range forces by @xmath18 in the case where @xmath19 , the dependence of distance for the total potential energy of the particle is logarithmic , and the force is then both short- and long - range . for potentials of the form ( [ 301 ] ) , the corresponding criteria implies that we have a force that is both short- and long - range .",
    "the definition of specific heat at constant volume is @xmath20 where `` @xmath21 '' expresses a time average .",
    "negative specific heat was first investigated by lynden - bell and wood  @xcite and thirring  @xcite .",
    "it is also described by hut  @xcite , lynden - bell  @xcite , lynden - bell and lynden - bell  @xcite and padmanabhan  @xcite .",
    "the virial theorem in its simplest form , without external pressure , applied to a system of particles interacting with potentials of the form ( [ 188 ] ) reads @xmath22 using ( [ 192 ] ) and the assumption @xmath23 , which is valid for many systems , we obtain that negative specific heat appears exactly for @xmath5 , independent of the number of dimensions , @xmath0(@xmath24 ) , of the system . in three dimensions",
    "@xmath25 corresponds to long - range forces .",
    "so , for three - dimensional systems ( and negative @xmath2 ) , negative specific heat seems to be correlated with the long - range nature of the forces . the padmanabhan model and the lynden - bell model ( see below ) were invented to verify that @xmath5 gives negative specific heat in three - dimensional systems . when considering systems with @xmath26 , it becomes apparent that the domain ( in @xmath0 and @xmath2 ) of negative specific heat predicted by the virial theorem , is just a small part of the domain with long - range forces .",
    "we will show that generalised versions of the padmanabhan model and the lynden - bell model ( both with @xmath10 ) give the same domain of negative specific heat as the virial theorem , for @xmath6 and any @xmath2(@xmath3 ) .",
    "for systems with particles interacting with potentials of the form ( [ 301 ] ) , and without external pressure , the virial theorem reads @xmath27 that is , energy supplied only contributes to the potential energy of the system .",
    "here we clearly have @xmath28 , so this is one of those systems where the spatial volume is important in the contribution to the temperature .",
    "we will show that , for this kind of system , the two generalized models give @xmath29 for all @xmath0(@xmath1 ) .",
    "the result of the analyses of systems with potentials of the form ( [ 188 ] ) is mapped in fig .  1 .",
    "the border between long- and short - range forces is marked .",
    "gravitation obeys , for @xmath15 , @xmath30 , and is therefore , according to ( [ 191 ] ) , a long - range force for @xmath15 . only for @xmath31",
    "we have significant negative specific heat in our models .",
    "only the padmanabhan model has a non - negative value on @xmath32 for @xmath31 , namely when @xmath33 .",
    "it is , however , as often suggested , reasonable to believe that long - range forces in a system is the cause of non - extensivity of the system . with non - extensivity ,",
    "we mean that if two originally separated subsystems with energy @xmath34 and @xmath35 are combined , their total energy will not be @xmath36 . for systems defined by short - range forces , the interaction energy between subsystems becomes negligible for large enough subsystems , since the interaction energy scales as the area of the subsystems , and then we have an extensive system . for subsystems interacting by long - range forces ,",
    "the interaction energy remains significant , since the interaction energy scales as the volume of the subsystems , and we then have a non - extensive system .",
    "oppenheim  @xcite investigates the statistical physics of systems with long - range interactions .",
    "the models under study are the padmanabhan model and the lynden - bell model .",
    "we are interested in the interval of @xmath37 where the system may have negative specific heat , that is , where no inner or outer cutoff affects the system . when regarding the outer cutoff , this implies @xmath38 for systems with potentials of the form ( [ 188 ] ) , and any @xmath37 for systems with potentials of the form ( [ 301 ] ) .",
    "( we chose the radius of the cutoffs so that they affect the system as little as possible . ) in their original version , these models involve an inner cutoff , with radius @xmath39 , that keeps the phase - space finite .",
    "this results in a region in @xmath37 with positive @xmath32 , even for systems where there is also a region where there is negative @xmath32 . here , we want to let @xmath40 .",
    "this admits a study of the effect of the potentials under consideration , without ( model dependent ) influences from this cutoff .",
    "as we will see , it also results in constant @xmath32 in the interval of @xmath37 for which the solutions are valid .",
    "therefore , results for @xmath32 that in the original models were represented by functions of @xmath37 , can here be represented by a single number .",
    "the limit @xmath40 can also be regarded as an idealization of the case where there is an inner cutoff with a small radius , but a radius so close to zero , that the value on @xmath32 does not significantly differ from the one obtained in the @xmath40 limit . to obtain an unambiguous value on @xmath32 when @xmath40 , we have to specify that other parameters do not go to some limit when @xmath39 does .",
    "this especially applies to @xmath37 for which we define @xmath41 , and to @xmath42 ( the number of particles in the lynden - bell model ) for which we define @xmath43 , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are some , eventually very big , numbers",
    ".    the padmanabhan model does not give well defined values on @xmath32 for @xmath46 , and the lynden - bell model is not meaningful for @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , we limit our investigations to @xmath10 .      this model is presented in padmanabhan  @xcite .",
    "it contains two particles , each with mass @xmath47 , that attract each other .",
    "they are contained in a spherical container to obtain ergodicity . in this essay , we generalise the model to @xmath0 dimensions ( @xmath10 ) and a potential of the form ( [ 188 ] ) , with arbitrary @xmath2 ( @xmath11 ) , and where @xmath12 and @xmath2 have the same sign .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the two particle s total mass ( @xmath50 ) , @xmath51 their reduced mass ( @xmath52 ) , @xmath53 the conjugate linear momentum of their centre of mass , @xmath54 their relative conjugate linear momentum , and @xmath9 the distance between the two particles ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "@xmath56 is the position of the centre of mass .",
    "the volume of the phase - space is @xmath57 where @xmath58 , and @xmath59 is the limit on @xmath9 set by the total energy of the system , @xmath37 .",
    "the number @xmath39 represents an inner cutoff that keeps the phase - space volume , @xmath60 , finite .",
    "we calculate the specific heat according to @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 is the first and second derivatives of @xmath60 respectively . from now on ,",
    "we restrict the calculation to the case @xmath6 .",
    "the case @xmath33 , we consider later .",
    "the formulas for @xmath64 and @xmath65 differ from @xmath66 with other exponents ( @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) and with other constants corresponding to @xmath69 .",
    "it follows from the properties of ( [ 251 ] ) , that multiplication of @xmath70 with a factor @xmath71 ( @xmath72 arbitrary , but not dependent of @xmath73 ) do not change @xmath32 .",
    "we let @xmath40 .",

    "for potentials of the form ( [ 301 ] ) , the specific heat is greater than zero , so here we focus on discussing potentials of the form ( [ 188 ] ) . as can be seen in fig .  1",
    ", there is a large region where long - range forces define the system , and where the system has positive specific heat .",
    "therefore , it seems to be something more than the long - range nature of forces that is necessary for negative specific heat . for the virial theorem , the region of negative specific heat coincides with the region of negative total energy of the system . for the padmanabhan model and the lynden - bell model ,",
    "it is possible to chose to study negative or positive energy of the system .",
    "we chose to study the case where there may be negative specific heat , that is , the case where no outer cutoff affects the system , and the energy has to be chosen negative for negative @xmath2 . in these cases , where all combinations of @xmath0 and negative @xmath2 are studied with negative energy , significant negative specific heat",
    "is still present only for @xmath5 , ( but not for the padmanabhan model when @xmath16 , where the specific heat is positive ) . in the padmanabhan model and the lynden - bell model ,",
    "the effective potential felt by a particle due to all the other particles , is of the form @xmath4 , where @xmath9 is the radial coordinate of the particle relative some fixed point , or centre of mass of the system .",
    "it would then be possible to suggest , that if the long - range nature of a force is sufficient to result in negative specific heat , this arises from emerging density distributions in the system that arise because of the long - range nature of the force , and which give an effective potential on another form than the one investigated here .",
    "these two models would then not be suitable for this kind of analysis .",
    "the results obtained from them are , hovewer , in agreement with the result from the virial theorem .",
    "the virial theorem relies on the mutual interaction between pairs of particles of the form @xmath124 , and is valid independently of any emerging density distribution .",
    "this then becomes an argument that there has to be something more than the long - range nature of the force to give negative specific heat . to regard",
    "the stability of a system and the virial theorem to be this fundamental mechanism , does not shed sufficient light on the dynamical aspects of negative specific heat .",
    "furthermore , the virial theorem applied to systems with interaction potentials that are not homogeneous in @xmath9 , does not give a direct relation between the kinetic and the potential energy of the system . the radial density ( or probability )",
    "distribution then enters the formula .",
    "this function is usually difficult to derive .    as mentioned before ,",
    "long - range forces give rise to non - extensivity . in thirring  @xcite , a model with a potential on a quite another form than the one studied here",
    "is presented . in his model",
    "it is possible to vary a parameter to change the degree of non - extensivity of the energy of the system .",
    "thirring s analysis shows that negative specific heat enters near to the point where the system becomes non - extensive .    the definition of long- and short - range forces used here might not be the relevant one .",
    "since the systems studied are not homogeneous , other definitions not relying on a matter distribution with constant density may be more accurate .    when it comes to the very important question of a physical mechanism behind negative specific heat , we will here try to give an interpretation that is consistent with the results of the two soluble models , and that is intuitively satisfying .",
    "it is built on the observation that systems with particles mainly affected by walls , exhibit positive specific heat . with `` walls '' , we here mean any potential that keeps particles in a limited volume of space , so that the specific heat is positive .",
    "this also includes `` smooth '' walls , like a potential of the form ( [ 188 ] ) with @xmath125 , which is sufficient to keep the particles from escaping to infinity , and that gives positive specific heat according to the two soluble models and the virial theorem .",
    "all positive @xmath2 represent this kind of wall , which we call a wall of the first kind .",
    "this kind of wall may roughly be characterised with the criteria @xmath126 .",
    "there is a second kind of wall , roughly characterised by @xmath127 and having both a very steep part ( representing the wall ) and a flat part ( enabling negative specific heat ) .",
    "one example of this kind of wall is the very steep potential at small @xmath9 when @xmath2 is negative . to result in positive specific heat for a complete system",
    ", this kind of wall requires that many of the particles in the system are close to each other .",
    "this is clearly true for systems where the density or probability distribution @xmath92 ( @xmath93 , where @xmath128 is the common density or common probability distribution ) has a singularity for @xmath96 .",
    "( the maximum density will in our models occur at @xmath129 , where @xmath39 is very close to zero . )",
    "this requires an explanation : for not very small @xmath9 , the density @xmath128 is a measure of how many particles that keep each other close with walls of the second kind . but with a very sharp maximum at @xmath129 , and @xmath39 very small , all particles at @xmath129 will keep each other close . therefore @xmath95 is here the correct measure .",
    "observe that @xmath95 is the same as the integrand in ( [ 246 ] ) and ( [ 198 ] ) .",
    "the series expansions of @xmath95 at @xmath96 is expressed in ( [ 305 ] ) and ( [ 306 ] ) .",
    "for those cases where we have negative @xmath2 and positive or zero specific heat , @xmath95 has a singular point at @xmath96 .",
    "negative specific heat only appears for those cases where @xmath2 is negative , and there is no singular point at @xmath96 .",
    "the only exception from this principle is the padmanabhan model in the case with @xmath16 and @xmath5 . for the lynden - bell model with @xmath120 ,",
    "the negative specific heat is very small , but the sign agrees with the principle . for a potential of the form ( [ 301 ] ) , we also have walls of the second kind .",
    "the principle in this case holds for all @xmath0 in both models , since the specific heat is positive and @xmath95 always has a singular point at @xmath96 .",
    "the principle described above is independent of the virial theorem .",
    "it is built upon properties of the potential , and upon characteristics of emerging density ( or probability ) distributions .",
    "( observe that the same mechanism would probably work even if there were sharp peaks in @xmath95 instead of singular points . )",
    "the principle can also be used to explain the results of thirring  @xcite when the energy is a superextensive parameter .",
    "a potential well surrounded by a domain with infinite potential energy confines the particles , independent of how high their energies are . at low energies ,",
    "the particles are confined in a smaller , even deeper well inside the former one .",
    "both at high and at low energies , the system is then mainly affected by walls of the first kind .",
    "this agrees with the results of thirring that show positive specific heat in these intervals of energy . in an intermediate interval of energy ,",
    "the system is mainly affected by a wall of the second kind for which , in the spherical symmetric case , there is a region in @xmath9 where @xmath130 is negative and big .",
    "( we here assume an approximation to the potential , such that second derivatives with respect to space parameters are defined everywhere . )",
    "since the potential is not steep at short distances between particles , it is obvious that in this system no singular points in any density distribution can be expected , and no other ways for the particles to create subsystems with many particles and positive specific heat , seem to exist .",
    "this also agrees with the results of thirring , which show negative specific heat in this domain of energy .",
    "for systems consisting of particles interacting with potentials of the form ( [ 188 ] ) , the padmanabhan model and the lynden - bell model give the same interval ( in @xmath0 and @xmath2 ) of negative specific heat as the virial theorem does , for @xmath6 .",
    "significant negative specific heat is present for @xmath5 .",
    "long - range forces obeys @xmath131 .",
    "hence , the long - range nature of a force is not sufficient to give negative specific heat .    to use the virial theorem to identify negative specific heat in systems with arbitrary interaction potentials ,",
    "the radial density ( or probability ) distribution has to be regarded . to derive these distributions , and their relation to energy and temperature , is crucial to identify negative specific heat in these systems , if the virial theorem will be used .    a physical mechanism behind negative specific heat , independent of the virial theorem , is suggested .",
    "it implies that positive specific heat appears when the system is strongly affected by what we call walls of the first kind , or the density distribution shows that many particles are affected by what we call walls of the second kind . in all other cases negative specific heat",
    "is assumed to be present .",
    "this is consistent with the results of the two soluble models , except for in one case ( the padmanabhan model with @xmath16 and @xmath5 ) .",
    "the principle may , in some developed form , be an important part of `` the general cause to negative specific heat '' .",
