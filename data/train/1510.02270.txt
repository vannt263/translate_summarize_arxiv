    "interacting particle problems have been widely studied in statistical mechanics as examples of many - body systems that usually exhibit rich types of behavior  @xcite . for equilibrium systems all the stationary properties are in principle known through the gibbs - boltzmann distribution , and the dynamics close to equilibrium can be described in very general terms  @xcite .",
    "out of equilibrium , studying such interacting many - particle systems analytically in dimensions other than one is usually difficult . in one dimension ,",
    "one of the most studied example is the simple exclusion process ( sep ) , where each lattice site is occupied by one hardcore particle or it is empty . in every small time interval @xmath3 , each particle moves to the neighboring site on the right ( left ) with probability @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) iff the target site is empty",
    ". a large number of results are known for this system ( see @xcite and references therein ) and these are obtained using sophisticated analytical tools such as bethe ansatz , matrix product ansatz or mappings to growth models  @xcite .",
    "another widely studied model of interacting particle systems is the _ random average process _",
    "( rap ) . in",
    "the rap particles move on a one dimensional continuous line in contrast to sep where hardcore particles move on a lattice .",
    "each particle moves to the right ( left ) by a",
    "_ random fraction _ of the space available till the next nearest particle on the right ( left ) with some rate .",
    "thus the jumps in one direction is a random fraction @xmath0 of the _ gap _ to the nearest particle in that direction where the random number @xmath6 is chosen from some distribution @xmath2 .",
    "many different results have been reported for this model in the literature .",
    "for example , dynamical properties like diffusion coefficient , variance of the tracer position and the pair correlation between the positions of two particles have been studied on an infinite line  @xcite . in particular",
    ", it has been shown that the variance of the tagged particle position in the steady state grows at late times as @xmath7 for the asymmetric case ( jumping rates to the right or to the left are different ) , whereas for the symmetric case it grows as @xmath8 .",
    "for the fully asymmetric case , this result was first derived by krug and garcia @xcite using a heuristic hydrodynamic description .",
    "later , the variance as well as other correlation functions , both for the symmetric and asymmetric cases , were computed rigorously by rajesh and majumdar @xcite .",
    "the rap model has also been shown to be linked to the porous medium equation  @xcite and appears in a variety of problems like the force propagation in granular media  @xcite , in models of mass transport @xcite , models of voting systems  @xcite , models of wealth distribution  @xcite and in the generalized hammersley process  @xcite .",
    "the rap can be shown to be equivalent , up to an overall translation , to mass transfer ( mt ) models  @xcite when one identifies the gaps or the inter - particle spacings in the rap picture with the masses . in terms of mt picture ,",
    "statistics of masses / gaps has been well studied . for uniform distributions @xmath2 ,",
    "invariant measures of the masses have been computed for a general class of rap ( or equivalently mt ) models  @xcite and for a totally asymmetric version of the model  @xcite defined on infinite line with different dynamics . for parallel updating scheme",
    "a mean - field calculation has been shown to be exact for certain parameters  @xcite and a matrix product ansatz has been developed  @xcite . finally , it has been shown that a condensation transition occurs in the related mass transfer model if one imposes a cutoff on the transferred mass ( _ i.e _ on the amount of jump made by the particles in rap picture )  @xcite .",
    "recently there has been a considerable interest in studying the motion of a special driven tagged particle in presence of other non - driven interacting particles . such special particle",
    "is called the tracer particle . in experimental studies , driven tracers in quiescent media have been used to probe rheological properties of complex media such as dna  @xcite , polymers  @xcite , granular media  @xcite or colloidal crystals  @xcite .",
    "some practical examples of biased tracer are : charged impurity being driven by applied electric field or a colloidal particle being pulled by optical tweezer in presence of other colloid particles performing random motion . on the theoretical side , problems with driven tracer have been studied in the context of sep where both particle number conservation and non - conservation ( absorption / desorption ) have been considered  @xcite . in presence of a driven tracer on an infinite line ,",
    "the particle density profile is inhomogeneous around the tracer and in absence of absorption or desorption , the current flowing across the system vanishes in the large time limit , as does the velocity of the tracer @xcite .",
    "other quantities like the mean and the variance of the position of the tracer have also been studied @xcite . in this contribution",
    "we derive new results for rap concerning the statistics of the gaps between particles on a ring in presence of a tracer particle which may be driven .",
    "more precisely we consider @xmath9 particles moving according to rap on a ring of size @xmath10 . in a small time duration @xmath3 , any particle , except the tracer particle",
    ", jumps to the right or left by a random fraction of the space available up to the neighboring particle on the right or left , respectively , with equal probability @xmath11 . on the other hand",
    "the tracer particle moves to the right or left by a random fraction of the space available in the respective direction with probability @xmath4 and @xmath5 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] . in this paper",
    "we study the statistics of the gaps between neighboring particles in the stationary state ( ss ) for the following two cases : ( i ) @xmath12 ( ii ) @xmath13 .",
    "note that the dynamics does not satisfy detailed balance even in the @xmath12 case , hence keeps the system always out of equilibrium . using a mapping from rap model of particles to an equivalent ( except for a global translation ) mt model , we find various interesting exact results related to gap statistics .",
    "the summary of these results are given below :    * when @xmath12 _ i.e. _ the tracer particle is not driven , all the particles are moving symmetrically .",
    "in this case , for a large class of jump distributions @xmath2 that satisfy some necessary and sufficient condition , we find that the stationary joint distribution of the gaps @xmath14 takes the following universal form : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the normalization constant and the delta function represents the global constraint due to total mass conservation in the mt picture .",
    "the parameter @xmath17 is given by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the @xmath20 moment of the jump distribution @xmath2 .",
    "similar factorized joint distributions with power law weight functions have also been obtained in the context of the q - model of force fluctuations in granular media @xcite as well as in a totally asymmetric version of the rap on an infinite line with parallel dynamics @xcite . for arbitrary jump distribution @xmath2",
    "we find that the average mass profile is given by @xmath21 and the two point gap - gap ( mass - mass ) correlation @xmath22 is expressed in terms of @xmath23 and @xmath24 as @xmath25.\\ ] ] * in the second case when @xmath13 _ i.e. _ the tracer particle is driven , the factorization form of the joint distribution of the gaps does not hold . in this case",
    "the stationary state has a global current associated with the non - zero mean velocity of the tracer , which supports an inhomogeneous mean mass profile in the mt picture .",
    "we compute this average mass profile @xmath26 and it is given by @xmath27.\\ ] ] we also compute the pair correlation @xmath28 in the steady state . in the thermodynamic limit _",
    "i.e. _ for both , @xmath29 and @xmath30 limit , while keeping the mean gap density @xmath31 fixed , we find that the average mass @xmath32 , variance @xmath33 and the correlation @xmath34 scale as @xmath35,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 represents order smaller that @xmath37 .",
    "we find explicit expressions of the scaling functions @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 in , and , respectively .",

    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ section : model ] the model and basic equations",
    "are written .",
    "we then study the rap without driven tracer in section  [ section : srap ] , where we focus on factorized stationary distributions with a global constraint and on the jump distributions for which they occur . in the next section  [ section : tsrap ]",
    "we study the influence of a driven tracer . for this case",

    "each particle of the rap can be mapped onto a link between two lattice sites in the mass model , the tracer particle corresponds to a particular bond ( between sites @xmath9 and @xmath45 ) . when going from the rap to the mass model one loses information about a translational degree of freedom .",

    "let us consider the first particle as the tracer particle which may be driven .",
    "their positions at time @xmath47 are denoted by @xmath48 for @xmath46 .",
    "the dynamics of the particles are given as follows .",
    "in an infinitesimal time interval @xmath47 to @xmath49 , any particle ( say @xmath50 ) other than the tracer , jumps from @xmath48 , either to the right or to the left with probability @xmath11 and with probability @xmath51 it stays at @xmath48 .",
    "the tracer particle jumps from @xmath52 to the right with probability @xmath4 , to the left with probability @xmath5 and does not jump with probability @xmath53 .",
    "the jump length , either to the right or to the left , made by any particle is a random fraction of the space available between the particle and its neighboring particle to the right or to the left .",
    "for example , the @xmath50 particle jumps by an amount @xmath54 $ ] to the right and by an amount @xmath55 $ ] to the left .",
    "the random variables @xmath56 are independently chosen from the interval @xmath57 $ ] and each is distributed according to the same distribution @xmath2 .",
    "for most of our calculations in this paper we consider arbitrary @xmath2 , unless it is specified . following the dynamics of the particles for the homogeneous case from @xcite , one can write down the stochastic evolution equations for the locations of the particles as : @xmath58 where to impose the periodicity in the problem , we introduced two auxiliary particles with positions @xmath59 and @xmath60 for all @xmath47 .",
    "note that the dynamics is invariant under simultaneous dilation of @xmath10 and of all the positions . in this paper ,",
    "the results are however stated for general @xmath10 .    since we are interested in the statistics of the gaps @xmath61 , it is convenient to work with an equivalent and appropriate mass transfer ( mt ) model with @xmath9 sites",
    ". the mass transfer model is defined as follows .",
    "corresponding to the @xmath9 particles in the rap , we consider a periodic one dimensional lattice of @xmath9 sites with a mass at each site .",
    "particles from the rap picture are mapped to the links between lattice sites in the mt picture .",
    "for example , the @xmath50 particle in rap corresponds to the link between sites @xmath62 and @xmath63 in mt model whereas the mass at site @xmath63 is equal to the gap @xmath64 between the @xmath50 and @xmath65 particle in rap . as a result for each configuration",
    "@xmath66 $ ] of the positions of the particles in the rap we have a unique mass configuration @xmath67 $ ] in the mt model where @xmath61 .",
    "the opposite is however not true , as the instantaneous configuration of the masses leaves freedom for a global translation of the system in the rap .",
    "such mapping from particle model to mass model have been considered in other contexts like from the exclusion process to the zero range process  @xcite .",
    "concerning the dynamics , a hop of the @xmath50 particle by @xmath68 towards the @xmath65 particle in the rap corresponds to a transfer of mass @xmath69 from @xmath50 site to the @xmath70 site in the mt model whereas a hop of the @xmath50 particle by @xmath71 towards the @xmath70 particle in the rap corresponds to a transfer of mass @xmath72 from @xmath70 site to the @xmath50 site .",
    "more precisely , the updating rules for the configurations in the mt model are given by : @xmath73 where the @xmath0 variables are independent and identically distributed according to @xmath2 and @xmath74 are @xmath45 with probability @xmath75 and @xmath76 otherwise except for @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",

    ":* the dynamics described in ( [ dyna - mass ] ) will take the system eventually to a stationary state .",

    "the conservation of the number of particles follows naturally from the fact that the lattice size is fixed .",
    "moreover , the dynamics clearly conserves the total mass _ i.e. _ we have @xmath89 , at all times .",
    "as stated in the introduction we are interested in the statistics of the gaps / masses @xmath64 in ss for the following two cases : ( i ) @xmath12 and ( ii ) @xmath13 . in the next section",
    "we analyze the first case .",
    "in this case the tracer particle is not driven and all the particles are moving symmetrically . in the large time limit , the inter - particle spacings or gaps will reach a stationary state . to understand completely the statistics of the gaps in ss , one would require to find the joint probability distribution function ( jpdf ) of all the gaps @xmath90 .",
    "clearly , this jpdf could be different for different choices of jump distributions @xmath2 . finding this jpdf for arbitrary @xmath2 is generally a hard task .",
    "we ask a relatively simpler question : for what choices of the jump distribution does the stationary jpdf have a factorized form @xmath91 except for a global mass conservation condition represented by the delta function . here",
    "@xmath92 ensures normalization .",
    "analogous questions have also been asked in different other contexts , for example in mass transport models @xcite , in zero range processes @xcite and in finite range processes @xcite . in the following subsection",
    "we will see that there exists a large class of @xmath2 for which the above form for jpdf is true .",
    "moreover we will see that the weights @xmath93 corresponding to individual sites are @xmath63 independent and the weight functions have universal form .",
    "in the previous section we have seen that if there exists a jump distribution @xmath2 for which jpdf @xmath85 is in the form ( [ eq : srapstatansatz ] ) then , @xmath106 should always be equal to @xmath129 for all @xmath63 where @xmath130 .",

    "this is a necessary condition that @xmath2 should satisfy to get a factorized jpdf in ss . for distributions",
    "@xmath2 satisfying such that the system is ergodic , we expect the stationary state to be unique .",
    "consequently the condition is sufficient to ensure that the steady state joint gap distribution is given by .",
    "analogous conditions satisfied by hopping rates , have been obtained in other mass transport models @xcite and in finite range process @xcite .",
    "we next find some solutions of ( [ eq : stat1massltu ] ) for particular values of @xmath134 , as well as a family of solutions that covers the whole @xmath134 range .",
    "* let us first consider the @xmath135 case .",
    "formally , @xmath135 corresponds to @xmath136 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath137 . for",
    "this choice of @xmath2 system breaks ergodicity and the stationary state is a trivial one with all the particles at a single point . as a result , @xmath138 . *",
    "a very special case is @xmath139 , for which the stationary distribution   is uniform over the allowed configurations . for this case",

    "interestingly , one can find _ all _ the possible solutions of   in this particular case .",

    "therefore , the set of solutions for @xmath139 are @xmath151 * general @xmath134 : one can find a simple family of solutions that spans the whole range of @xmath152 values , @xmath153 in particular , taking @xmath154 gives the uniform distribution .",

    "one can check that the following scaling form @xmath156 solves   for @xmath155 , where @xmath157 is a real , positive function for @xmath158 and its laplace transform @xmath159 satisfies @xmath160 note that @xmath161 .",

    "now these @xmath167 coefficients have to be chosen such that @xmath161 and @xmath157 is real and positive for @xmath168 .",
    "the simplest of them is @xmath169 which gives the solution @xmath170 some other examples of solutions in @xmath162 form are given in appendix ( [ appendix - phihat_s ] ) .",
    "the above analysis suggests that there are possibly infinitely many solutions of the ( [ eq : stat1massltu ] ) for any @xmath171 .",
    "although we found all the solutions for @xmath135 and @xmath139 , and a somewhat simpler characterization of them for large @xmath134 , a proper characterization of all the possible solutions for arbitrary @xmath134 seems difficult .",
    "we are however able to make a few general remarks about the properties of the solutions of .    * if @xmath172 and @xmath173 both are solutions of ( [ eq : stat1massltu ] ) corresponding to the same @xmath134 , then any normalized linear combination of them _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath174 for @xmath175 is also a solution .",
    "* secondly , the system is invariant by dilation of time . replacing @xmath47 by @xmath176 is equivalant to replacing @xmath2 by @xmath177 for @xmath178 .",
    "indeed , with this latter choice a chosen particle hops with probability @xmath179 only , and nothing happens with probability @xmath180 .",
    "clearly , the values of @xmath23 and @xmath24 depend on the value of @xmath180 however @xmath180 should not appear in the stationary distribution . the stationary distribution therefore can not depend on @xmath23 and @xmath24 independently , but only through a particular combination in which @xmath180 cancels , _ i.e",
    "_ @xmath130 . all the solutions given above are understood up to a dilation of time .",
    "equation   necessary for getting the stationary state is quite robust , as the same equation can be obtained in the case where all the particles are identical but asymmetrically moving . in a much more general case where each particle has its own hopping rates @xmath181 and @xmath182 to the right and to the left ,",
    "respectively , it can be shown that one still obtains as the condition for getting the factorized ss .",

    "the boundary conditions   on the derivatives being the same at @xmath76 and @xmath45 imply that the total flux of the electric field exiting the square domain vanishes , so that the charge inside the square must vanish as well .",
    "one can directly observe this fact by integrating the charge distribution on the right hand side of over the unit square domain .      once again using the knowledge of the gap fluctuations one could intend to study the distribution of the center of mass position @xmath214 as done in the unbiased case .",
    "however the predicted diffusion coefficient does not match with the numerical simulation results ( not presented here ) .",
    "this discrepancy can be attributed to strong correlations among increments @xmath294 at different times which can be evidenced numerically .",
    "in this paper we have studied the statistics of the gaps between neighboring particles moving according to rap on a ring .",
    "the particles hop symmetrically on both sides except for a tracer particle which may be driven . taking advantage of the mapping between the rap and a mt model , equivalent up to a global shift ,",
    "we have obtained some exact results . in this mapping",
    "the masses correspond to the gaps between successive particles of the rap , and a global constraint therefore enforces that the sum of the masses is constant and is equal to the length of the ring .    in the non - driven tracer case ( @xmath12 ) we found that when the jump distribution @xmath2 satisfies a necessary and sufficient condition ( [ eq : stat1massltu ] ) the stationary joint distributions of the gaps takes an universal form ( [ eq : statbeta1 ] ) parametrized by a positive constant @xmath130 .",
    "we showed that there exists infinite number of solutions of ( [ eq : stat1massltu ] ) for @xmath2 .",
    "we have found a quite large number of solutions however those do not include all the possible solutions .",
    "the calculation and qualitative results are very similar to those obatained by coppersmith _",
    "et  al _ @xcite in the context of the q - model of force fluctuations in granular media and to those obtained by zielen and schadschneider  @xcite for the totally asymmetric rap with parallel update on an infinite line . in their case",
    "also the factorized stationary distributions depend only on one parameter , which is however different from ours .",
    "although these distributions are never equilibrium ones , cancellations in the master equation still occur between nearest neighbors only and there is no large - scale mass current . from this joint stationary distribution the single site marginal distribution of gaps /",
    "masses have been computed , which also has universal form .",
    "interestingly , we numerically observe that , for some @xmath2s which do not satisfy ( [ eq : stat1massltu ] ) the single site mass / gap distribution can also be described quite well by this universal form .    in the case with a driven tracer",
    "the stationary distribution of the masses is not in the form of factorized joint distribution . in the thermodynamic limit progress",
    "has however been made using the fact that the correlations between different masses become negligible for large systems . besides the average mass profile , which is easily obtained for any size , we computed the two - point gap correlations in the thermodynamic limit . in the same limit",
    "we also have computed approximate single site mass distribution of the gaps .",
    "there are several other future extensions of our work .",
    "for example , we have already mentioned the problem of characterizing all the solutions @xmath2s of ( [ eq : stat1massltu ] ) properly . for those jump distributions @xmath2 that do not satisfy ( [ eq : stat1massltu ] )",
    ", it would be interesting to look for other exact forms of the stationary state such as matrix products  @xcite or cluster - factorized states  @xcite .",
    "similarly , computing the distribution of @xmath214 for the driven tracer case remains an interesting future problem , and solving this problem probably requires studying the whole history of the system .",
    "a different possibility is to vary the nature of the drive .",
    "note that the @xmath295 case of this paper corresponds to a closed segment with fixed walls at @xmath296 and @xmath297 , for this case a large class of fraction distributions @xmath2 have been presented for which the stationary state factorizes .",
    "it would be interesting to design natural open boundaries for the rap in order to study , say , its conduction properties , and in particular the influence of @xmath134 .",
    "another possible extension would be to introduce a second driven tracer . in this case",
    "an important question is to find the nature and the magnitude of the interaction between the two tracers .",
    "we thank shiladitya sengupta for carefully reading the manuscript . the support of the israel science foundation ( isf ) and of the minerva foundation with funding from the federal german ministry for education and research",
    "is gratefully acknowledged .",
    "s.n.m wants to thank the hospitality of the weizmann institute where this work started during his visit as a weston visiting professor .",
    "here we present some solutions of ( [ eq : stat1masslty ] ) in @xmath162 form for large @xmath134 : @xmath299",
    "in the second step , focusing only on the bulk equations ( _ i.e. _ leaving the boundary equations ) we write ( [ eq : evodij ] ) in the following discrete laplace equation form : @xmath304    we now put the scaling forms ( [ sclng - dij ] ) and ( [ sclng - dii ] ) of @xmath34 , and the scaling form ( [ msqsclng ] ) of @xmath32 in the above equation . equating the terms at order @xmath274 , one obtains @xmath305 which has been verified numerically in fig .",
    "( [ fig : di ] ) . after imposing   we can check that terms of order @xmath275 automatically vanish .",
    "the order @xmath277 of ( [ discrete - lap - eq ] ) gives a laplacian of @xmath306 , while diagonal terms on the left and right hand sides combine to give a source term , @xmath307 = -\\frac{\\mu_2}{\\mu_1-\\mu_2}~\\delta(x - y)~(\\mathcal{m}^2)''(x ) , \\label{eq : diff - corr}\\ ] ] where @xmath308 is the derivative of the function @xmath146 .",
    "while taking the double derivative of @xmath38 one should keep in mind that the function changes discontinuously when going from @xmath309 ( which is actually @xmath310 on a ring ) to @xmath311 .",
    "this discontinuity in @xmath38 can be easily visualized if we consider middle particle ( @xmath312 particle ) as the driven tracer particle instead of the @xmath313 particle in rap . in this case",
