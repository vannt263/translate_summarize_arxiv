    "a loop @xmath10 in the group of hamiltonian diffeomorphisms @xcite of a symplectic manifold @xmath11 can be considered as a clutching function of a hamiltonian fibration @xmath12 with fibre @xmath2 .",

    "furthermore one can consider on @xmath3 the first chern class @xmath18 of the vertical tangent bundle of @xmath3 .",
    "these canonical cohomology classes on @xmath3 determine the characteristic number ( see @xcite ) @xmath19 which depends only on the homotopy class of @xmath0 .",
    "since @xmath20 is an @xmath21-valued group homomorphism on @xmath22 , the non vanishing of @xmath20 implies that the group @xmath22 is infinite .",
    "that is , @xmath20 can be used to detect the infinitude of the corresponding homotopy group .",

    "the value of this mixed action - maslov homomorphism on a loop @xmath0 is , in many cases , easy to calculate , since it is a linear combination of the symplectic action around _ any _ orbit @xmath28 and the maslov index of the linearized flow @xmath29 along this orbit . by contrast , @xmath20 is defined for hamiltonian loops in general manifolds ( non necessarily monotone ) , and its value is mostly not so easy to determine from the definition .",
    "our purpose in this note is to obtain an explicit expression for @xmath30 , which can be used to calculate its value .",
    "more precisely , when the bundle @xmath31 admits local symplectic trivializations whose domains are fixed by the diffeomorphisms @xmath32 , we deduce a formula for @xmath30 in which appear a contribution related to the maslov indices of the linearized flow @xmath8 in the trivializations , and a second one in which are involved transition functions of the bundle @xmath33 .",

    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we recall the construction of the coupling class @xmath5 following @xcite .",

    "we check and apply the formulae obtained in section 3 . using these formulae",
    ", we calculate @xmath30 , when @xmath0 is the loop in @xmath46 generated by the @xmath47-turn rotation of @xmath4 around the @xmath48-axis . the result @xmath49 agrees with the fact that @xmath50 and @xmath20 is a group homomorphism on @xmath1 .",
    "we also prove that @xmath20 on @xmath51 vanishes identically . when @xmath52 this result is consistent with the fact that @xmath53 .",
