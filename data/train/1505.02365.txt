    "this paper has two objectives .",
    "the first objective is to apply algebraic topology to a problem in chemical physics .",
    "the problem , when translated into topology , is a special case of a more general problem which is both natural and elementary to state .",
    "our other objective is an investigation of the general problem , which we hope will be of independent interest to mathematicians .    in its barest form ,",
    "the chemical physics problem involves calculating the set of solutions to a system of linear equations parametrized by the circle .",
    "the equations are derived from a finite graph equipped with additional structure , where the graph is a mathematical representation of a molecule .",
    "the set of nontrivial solutions of the system of equations is finite and the problem is to enumerate them , taking multiplicity into account .",
    "the solutions are called _ excitons . _",
    "we refer the reader to the end of this section for some of the historical background and to the chemical physics paper @xcite for a more extensive treatment .    to translate to problem into algebraic topology , the equations first need to be converted to a compact form .",
    "the requisite form is a parametrized @xmath1-eigenvalue problem@xmath2 quantum mechanics suggests that for all but finitely many points @xmath3 , equation has no non - trivial solutions , and this will be taken as an axiom .",
    "consequently , the solution to the problem is reduced to that of enumerating with multiplicity the set of points @xmath4 for which has a non - trivial solution .",
    "from the perspective of algebraic topology , an advantage of equation is that it recasts the problem as a kind of intersection theory question in the unitary group @xmath0 : the number of excitons is just the intersection number of the curve @xmath5 with the subspace @xmath6 consisting of unitary matrices having non - trivial ( + 1)-eigenspace .",
    "however , there is a catch : for @xmath7 , the space @xmath8 is not a manifold .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath8 is a stratified space and the intersection problem turns out to be tractable .",
    "the intersection problem alluded to above is a special case of a more general problem , whose investigation is the other goal of this paper .",
    "suppose @xmath9 is a closed smooth oriented manifold of dimension @xmath10 equipped with a filtration @xmath11 giving an oriented stratifold structure @xcite .",
    "in particular , the open strata @xmath12 are smooth manifolds of dimension @xmath13 . concretely , one encounters such a filtration if @xmath9 is equipped with the structure of a cw complex , the filtration is given by the skeleta and the characteristic maps for the cells satisfy a smoothness condition .",
    "examples of this kind arise in morse theory @xcite , @xcite .    for a fixed degree @xmath14 ,",

    "henceforth , assume that the preimage @xmath25 is a finite set of points .",
    "is there a description of the homological intersection number given in terms of the restriction of @xmath26 to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of @xmath27 ?    stated another way , the question asks for a formula for the global invariant in terms of local invariants coming from the differential topology of the map @xmath26 near the set @xmath27 .    in certain cases , the answer to",
    "the above question is well - known and classical .",
    "for example , if @xmath28 happens to be a closed submanifold with fundamental class @xmath18 and @xmath26 happens to be transverse to @xmath29 , then the homological intersection number is just the sum over the points of @xmath27 counted with sign .",
    "however , in the case addressed in this paper , @xmath29 is not a manifold and the function @xmath26 is not assumed to satisfy any transversality .    in the case considered in the paper , @xmath9 is @xmath0 , the unitary group of @xmath30 matrices , a manifold of dimension @xmath31 .",
    "we equip @xmath0 with a cw decomposition whose @xmath32-skeleton is the space @xmath33 described above .",
    "then @xmath34 ( for @xmath35 ) is infinite cyclic with preferred generator @xmath36 .",
    "if @xmath7 , then @xmath29 is not a manifold ; see example [ ex : u2 ] below .",
    "a main result ( theorem [ bigthm : indexthm ] ) of this paper is a kind of _ index theorem_. the crucial difference with the classical case is that the sign of a point @xmath37 is now replaced by a _",
    "local index _",
