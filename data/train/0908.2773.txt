    "it is well known that the initial , intense @xmath2-ray spike from giant flares of extragalactic magnetars  locally classified as either soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) or anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) at kpc distances  could be mistaken for cosmological short gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) ( hurley et al . 2005 ) .",
    "typical peak outputs of magnetar flares lie in the range 10@xmath3 ergs@xmath4 ( sgr 180620 in jan 1979 ) to 10@xmath5 ergs@xmath4 ( sgr 052566 in mar 1979 ) would not be detected in galaxies lying at mpc distances , but the peak luminosity of the intense flare from sgr 180620 in dec 2004 was 2@xmath6 ergs@xmath4 where the usually adopted distance of sgr 180620 is @xmath7 = 15 kpc .",
    "batse , aboard the compton gamma - ray observatory , would have detected the initial @xmath80.1s spike from sgr 180620 had it originated from a galaxy 3050 @xmath7 mpc away .    for an adopted rate of one such intense flare , per 30 yr , per milky way galaxy , a total of 200300 @xmath9 flares would have been detected by batse over its 9.5 year lifetime , representing 4060% @xmath9 of all short grbs detected by batse ( hurley et al .",
    "2005 ; lazzati et al . 2005 ) .",
    "consequently , one would expect a strong correlation between the position of batse short bursts and nearby star - forming galaxies .",
    "however , tanvir et al . ( 2005 ) found that only 10% of short grbs originated from within 30 mpc , while lazzati et al .",
    "( 2005 ) concluded that the contribution of giant magnetar flares to short grb statistics was no greater than @xmath84% .",
    "only a few candidate extragalactic giant flares have been proposed , such as grb051103 in m81 ( ofek et al .",
    "2006 ) , although such claims remain inconclusive ( hurley et al .",
    "apparently , the frequency of intense magnetar flares is much lower than one per 30 years , which remains a very credible possibility , unless the widely adopted 15 kpc distance to sgr 180620 is incorrect .        fortunately , sgr 180620 lies towards a young star cluster , whose near - ir appearance is shown in fig .",
    "photometric ( colour - magnitude diagrams ) and spectroscopic ( stellar subtypes ) tools allow ages and main - sequence turn - off masses to be derived , albeit somewhat dependent upon isochrones from evolutionary models of massive stars .",
    "walborn ( 2009 ) discusses the characteristics of the youngest star clusters , for which o stars represent the visually brightest stars up to ages of a few myr ( e.g. ngc  3603 ) with af supergiants dominating for ages closer to 410 myr ( e.g. westerlund 1 ) .",
    "thereafter , the visual and near - ir appearance of star clusters is distinguished by red supergiants ( e.g. rsg cluster # 1 : figer et al . 2006 ; rsg cluster # 2 : davies et al .",
    "the usual 15kpc distance towards sgr 180620 relies upon kinematics ( corbel et al . 1997 ; eikenberry et al . 2004 ; figer et al . 2004 ) , but if we assume that it is physically associated with a visibly obscured ( @xmath10 = 3 mag ) , massive star cluster ( eikenberry et al . 2004 ; figer et al . 2005 ) , we may combine their physical properties with evolutionary models to obtain the age and ( spectroscopic parallax ) distance to the cluster .",
    "the likelihood of chance alignment between the cluster and magnetar is low . indeed , muno et al .",
    "( 2006 ) obtained a confidence of @xmath1199.97% for the association of magnetar cxou j164710.2455217 ( axp ) with the westerlund 1 cluster ( see fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] ) . both clusters host rare luminous blue variables and wolf - rayet stars in addition to ob stars ,",
    "although westerlund  1 is an order of magnitude more massive ( 510@xmath12 clark et al . 2005 ; mengel & tacconi - garman 2007 ; brandner et al .",
    "2008 ) , so hosts many more evolved massive stars  24 wr stars ( crowther et al . 2006b ) versus 4 wr stars in cl 180620 ( eikenberry et al . 2004 ; figer et al . 2005 ) .",
    "bibby et al . ( 2008 ) presented gemini - s / gnirs near - ir spectroscopy of ob supergiants and non - dusty wolf - rayet stars in sgr 180620 from which a cluster distance of 8.7@xmath13 kpc was obtained using a calibration of spectral type versus absolute magnitude .",
    "reliable ob spectral types were obtained in two cases from comparison with the near - ir atlas of hanson et al .",
    "dust producing wr stars are highly unreliable as absolute magnitude calibrators since their near - ir appearance is dictated by the properties of their dust rather than underlying stellar continua ( crowther et al",
    ". 2006b ) .",
    "main sequence ob stars would provide superior absolute magnitude calibrators with respect to wolf - rayet stars and ob supergiants , but these would require long near - ir integrations for reliable stellar classification even for present 810 m telescopes .        alternatively , the simultaneous presence of wn and wc - type wolf - rayet stars in sgr 180620 suggest an age of 4@xmath141 myr , from which an independent distance measurement was obtained using isochrones for ob stars ( lejeune & schaerer 2001 ) based on the evolutionary models of meynet et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and the b supergiant temperature calibration of crowther et al .",
    "( 2006a ) . for ages of 2.8 , 4 and 5 myr ,",
    "both cluster distances and magnetar masses were obtained , as presented in fig  [ fig1 ] .",
    "let us consider the properties of b supergiants and wc stars for each of the three cases in turn ,    * for this distance , the cluster b - type stars studied by bibby et al .",
    "( 2008 ) would be exceptionally luminous , with four of the five cases exceeding @xmath15 .",
    "instances of such luminous b supergiants are known , such as @xmath16 sco ( crowther et al .",
    "2006a ) . however , such stars display hypergiant spectral morphologies ( b1.5ia@xmath17 for @xmath16 sco ) , whereas the b stars in cl 180620 appear to be morphologically normal ia , iab or ib supergiants .",
    "in addition , solar metallicity evolutionary models for 120 @xmath18 stars allowing for rotational mixing and contemporary mass - loss prescriptions indicate that the wc phase is not predicted until after 3.5 myr for a model initially rotating at 40% of critical ( maximum ) velocity ( hirschi , priv .",
    "for the 120 @xmath18 non - rotating case , the wc phase would be anticipated to _ commence _ after 2.8 myr ( meynet & maeder 2003 ) . * for this distance , the cluster b - type stars would be possess luminosities in the range @xmath19 = 5.4  5.7 , close to the @xmath19 = 5.5 average of 25 o9.5b3ia supergiants studied by crowther et al .",
    "( 2006a ) , the majority of which are morphologically normal . from meynet & maeder ( 2003 )",
    ", the hydrogen - burning phase of a non - rotating 50 @xmath18 star is predicted to last for 4.0 myr , followed by short wn and wc phases , each of @xmath80.1 myr . in this case",
    "wc stars would be expected after @xmath84.1 myr .",
    "models initially rotating at 300 kms@xmath4 suggest longer main - sequence and wr phases , corresponding to the onset of the wc phase after 5 myr . * for this distance , the cluster b - type stars would be possess luminosities in the range @xmath19 = 5.1  5.5 , somewhat below the average of the ia supergiants studied by crowther et al .",
    "( 2006a ) , and more representative of iab or ib supergiants ( searle et al .",
    "our gnirs near - ir spectroscopic datasets does not allow us to discriminate between ia and ib supergiants .",
    "again , turning to the wr population , from meynet & maeder ( 2003 ) , a non - rotating 40 @xmath18 solar metallicity model would not be expected to remain as a wn star prior to core - collapse , whereas a model initially rotating at 300 kms@xmath4 is predicted to advance to the wc phase only after @xmath85.7 myr .    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     overall , a spectroscopic distance of 710 kpc is favoured from the simultaneous presence of normal b supergiants , plus wn and wc stars in cl 180620 .",
    "this cluster distance is compared to previous work in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , and is consistent with both the cameron et al .",
    "( 2005 ) magnetar distance and mcclure - griffiths & gaensler ( 2005 ) reanalysis thereof .",
    "overall , we find a reduced cluster distance of @xmath20 , and since the contribution of giant flares to batse short grb statistics scales with @xmath21 we find that giant flares contribute 8@xmath22% of all batse short bursts , for the _ canonical _ rate of one giant flare per 30 yr per milky way galaxy .",
    "of course , the frequency of once per 30 years is merely a crude upper limit , since it originates from the fact that solely one giant flare ( from sgr 180620 ) has been detected from a milky way source since the advent of gamma - ray telescopes .",
    "nevertheless , our result largely resolves the previous ( low ) rate problem , namely ( i ) @xmath84% from the scarcity of batse sources with spectral properties similar to giant flares ( lazzati et al .",
    "2005 ) ; ( ii ) @xmath810% from giant flares within 30 mpc ( tanvir et al . 2005 ) ; ( iii ) @xmath23% from the lack of local host galaxies for several well - localized short grbs ( nakar et al .",
    "2006 ) ; ( iv ) a few percent contamination from the absence of giant flares from galaxies in the virgo cluster ( popov & stern 2006 ) .",
    "as discussed above , associated clusters allow progenitor masses of magnetars to be estimated , since magnetars are believed to be young objects . for sgr 180620 , bibby et al .",
    "( 2008 ) infer a progenitor mass of 48@xmath24 , adding to evidence linking some magnetars to very massive stars .",
    "identical conclusions were reached by muno et al .",
    "( 2006 ) for the axp cxou j164710.2 - 455216 in the star cluster westerlund  1 ( clark et al . 2005 ) whose age and stellar content is remarkably similar to cl 180620 .",
    "other observations have also been used to link magnetars to high mass progenitors .",
    "for example , gaensler et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have interpreted a hydrogen shell centred upon the axp 1e 1048.15937 as a wind blown bubble from its 3040 @xmath18 progenitor .    however , lower progenitor mass magnetars are also known .",
    "sgr 1900 + 14 possesses a pair of m5 supergiants ( vrba et al .",
    "1996 ; 2000 ) .",
    "davies et al .",
    "( 2009 ) have recently presented deep k - band imaging of these red supergiants , in which faint members of the associated cluster cl 1900 + 14 can be identified .",
    "davies et al .",
    "( 2009 ) have obtained a kinematic distance of 12.5 kpc to these m supergiants , and an evolutionary age of 14@xmath141 myr , based upon contemporary solar metallicity evolutionary models of meynet & maeder ( 2000 ) plus bolometric corrections of levesque et al .",
    "if one assumes that the progenitor of sgr 1900 + 14 originated from this cluster , an initial mass of 17@xmath142 @xmath18 can be deduced .",
    "similar results would be obtained for the axp 1e 1841045 ( within kes 73 ) _ if _ it originated from either rsg cluster # 2 ( davies et al .",
    "2007 ) or rsg cluster # 3 ( clark et al . 2009 ) .",
    "these are located at a similar distance to 1e 1841045 , within a few degrees of its sight - line , although the likelyhood of physical assocation is naturally much weaker than for sgr 180620 , cxou j164710.2 - 455216 and sgr 1900 + 14 .",
    "table  [ table1 ] provides a summary of magnetar progenitor masses inferred from potentially associated star clusters . in the milky way ,",
    "it is apparent that magnetars can be produced by both @xmath25 and @xmath0 stars .",
    "the former presumably originated in type ii - p sn following the red supergiant ( rsg ) phase , while the latter are likely to have originated in a type ibc sn following the wr phase . from comparison with heger et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , certainly sgr 1900 + 14 and possibly sgr 180620 would be expected to produce neutron star remnants at solar metallicity . for metal",
    "poor populations the latter channel is unlikely to be available since reduced mass - loss rates during the main sequence and post - main sequence phases would likely lead to the formation of a black hole for such high initial mass stars . no direct evidence for supernova remnants is known in cl 180620 , westerlund  1 or cl 1900 + 14 .",
    "presumably this is because the combined stellar winds from other cluster members will blow a sufficiently large cavity that a supernova remnant could expand into without showing any observable emission .    finally , it should be bourne in mind that cluster ages and magnetar progenitor masses rely upon the reliability of evolutionary models .",
    "values quoted herein are based upon a set of assumptions which have subsequently been improved upon through mass - loss rate prescriptions and allowance for rotational mixing ( meynet & maeder 2000 ) .",
    "close binary evolution also further complicates inferred main - sequence turn - off masses .",
    "therefore , one should not necessarily treat specific progenitor masses or cluster ages as robust , although the clear differences between the stellar content of clusters 180620 and 1900 + 14 undoubtedly demonstrate distinct channels leading to the production of magnetars .",
