    "quantum entanglement ( nonclassical correlations between separated partners ) is identified as a key resource for emerging information technologies @xcite , especially in modern quantum electronics . in addition",

    "electron entanglement can be produced either by interacting mechanisms@xcite ( e.g. , exchange coupling and superconducting pairing ) or noninteracting ones @xcite ( based on exchange correlations in scattering processes from external potentials ) .",
    "electronic devices such as quantum dots and quantum wires have been proposed to produce entanglement of electrons without interactions @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of these noninteracting entanglers depends on the scattering of electrons traveling through the system .",
    "thus , features of the scattering matrix @xmath0 associated with the entangler , such as symmetries and dimensionality , determines the degree of electron entanglement .",
    "effects of quantum chaotic scattering on orbital entanglement production in quantum dots have been studied in the past @xcite . in these ballistic microstructures , electrons",
    "are elastically scattered , while the chaotic character of the scattering produces stochastic fluctuations of the orbital entanglement .",
    "therefore a statistical analysis of the entanglement is required .",
    "in essence , those works addressed the effect of the underlying classically chaotic dynamics of the dot on entanglement production.@xcite    in contrast to the ballistic scattering in quantum dots , in which electrons are scattered off the dot boundary , in disordered quantum wires electrons suffer multiple scattering , e.g. , from impurities .",
    "thus , if a quantum wire is used as entangler , a new ingredient is expected to play a relevant role in the description of the properties of the electron entanglement : the localization length of the electron wave functions , determined by the disorder strength . actually , very recent experiments @xcite have opened the possibility of producing entangled electron pairs in quantum conductors from single excitations , named levitons , in the fermi sea @xcite .    in general ,",
    "disorder effects in quantum electronic devices have been of interest from both fundamental and applied points of view .",
    "for instance , the presence of disorder in a system leads to the widely studied phenomenon of anderson localization , a spatial localization of the electron wave function .",
    "lattice defects and impurities are two examples of sources of disorder , which may be unavoidable in electronic systems .",
    "therefore , disorder effects in phase - coherent quantum transport have been of particular interest .",
    "in addition , the presence of disorder gives a stochastic character to the electron scattering processes and calls for a statistical analysis of scattering - dependent phenomenon , such as the production of orbital entanglement .",
    "random - matrix theory has been successfully applied to study different statistical properties of scattering in disordered systems @xcite . in particular , by using a scattering approach to the problem of quantum transport ( landauer - bttiker approach ) several electronic properties of disordered quantum wires have been analyzed within a random - matrix approach . in this theoretical framework , a fokker - planck equation for the probability density of the transmission eigenvalues of a quantum wire of length @xmath1 and width @xmath2 has been derived @xcite .",
    "it turns out that this transmission probability depends on only a single physical parameter : the localization length .    in this work ,",
    "the statistical properties of the production of orbital entanglement in disordered quantum wires are studied .",
    "we adopt a random - matrix approach to study the distribution of an entanglement indicator : the two - qubit _ concurrence _ , @xmath3 .",
    "we show the evolution of the concurrence distribution as a function of the disorder strength for different symmetry classes : broken and preserved time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) .",
    "as we show below , the presence of trs is crucial for the production of highly entangled states . in general , as the strength of disorder decreases , the possibility of having highly entangled states increases .",

    "our setup is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] .",
    "two single - channel leads are attached at the ends of the wire . left and right leads are connected to electron reservoirs @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "this resembles the orbital entanglers proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite , provided the chaotic quantum dot is replaced by a disordered quantum wire .",
    "a low bias voltage between reservoirs leads to a coherent current along the wire from left to right .",
    "exchange correlations due to electron scattering within the wire create the conditions for the production of entanglement between transmitted ( to the right ) and reflected ( to the left ) electrons , as we show in the following .",
    "we start by considering an uncorrelated two - particle state incoming from the left reservoir in fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] : @xmath7 the @xmath8 creates an incoming electron excitation in lead @xmath9 above the fermi sea @xmath10 at zero temperature . for simplicity ,",

    "we conclude that the component @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ psi - out - n ] ) corresponds ( up to a normalization factor ) to a two - qubit entangled state .",
    "an efficient measure for quantification of two - qubit entanglement is the concurrence @xmath32 .",
