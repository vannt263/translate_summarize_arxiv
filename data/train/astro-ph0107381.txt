    "it has recently been shown ( elliott & kosovichev @xcite ) that the inclusion of relativistic effects in the equation of state ( eos ) leads to a very good agreement between the solar models and the seismic sun .",
    "in particular , the inversions of soi - mdi / soho @xmath2-mode frequencies for the adiabatic exponent @xmath1 show that mhd eos reproduces the interior of the sun with great accuracy , when the relativistic contribution to the fermi - dirac statistics is included .",
    "it is thus interesting to approach the same problem by means of the forward analysis by comparing the theoretical eigenfrequencies with the observed ones .",
    "unfortunately this method is not directly applicable since our description of the outer layers of the sun is still far from complete and many theoretical uncertainties would influence our conclusions . however , since such small effects in solar eos are most important only in the deep interior , it is possible to make use of the acustic mode frequency small separation diagnostic , @xmath3 , for spherical harmonic degrees @xmath4 and radial order @xmath5 ( tassoul @xcite ) .",
    "the main property of this quantity is that it is strongly sensitive to the sound speed gradient near the solar centre while it is weakly dependent on the details of the treatment of the outer layers .",
    "since the relativistic effects manifest themselves mainly through a depletion of @xmath6 of the adiabatic index @xmath1 , we expect a quantitatively similar change of sound speed gradient in the solar core .    the acoustic mode frequency small separation analysis has recently been used for estimating the seismic age of the sun ( dziembowski _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) and the related implications of the uncertainties in the @xmath7 astrophysical factor determinations ( bonanno & patern @xcite ) .    here",
    "we show that the mentioned above analysis can also be used to verify how the different physical characteristics of the mhd and opal eos reflect on the accuracy of the description of the stratification of the internal layers of the sun . on performing a @xmath8 analysis of",
    "the latest published golf / soho data for different solar models , we confirm the main conclusion of elliott & kosovichev ( @xcite ) , based on an inversion analysis , that the inclusion of the relativistic effects in the eos is in any case required to improve the accuracy of solar models , independent of which eos is used .",
    "in our analysis we used the garching solar model ( garsom ) code which has been described in detail in schlattl _",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "it includes the latest opal - opacities and either opal or mhd eos , and it takes into account the microscopic diffusion of the elements heavier than hydrogen .",
    "our standard solar model has been verified in detail in turck - chize _ et al . _",
    "( @xcite ) and found in good agreement with other up - to - date solar models , and , in particular , it is consistent with the observed @xmath9 and @xmath10 within @xmath11 , at an age of @xmath12 , adopting the surface value @xmath13 .",
    "we then included the relativistic correction leading term to the adiabatic index @xmath1 derived from the relativistic evaluation of the fermi - dirac integrals of the eos in the solar core by means of the expression ( elliott & kosovichev @xcite ) : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a dimensionless temperature in units of @xmath16 , with @xmath17 the electron mass , @xmath18 the light speed in vacuum , @xmath19 the boltzmann constant , and @xmath20 the hydrogen abundance by mass . as expected , the correction to @xmath1 is negative , namely @xmath21 , since @xmath1 tends to shift from the non - relativistic value of 5/3 to the extremely relativistic one of 4/3 .",
    "the corresponding relativistic corrections to the leading terms for sound speed , @xmath22 , and density , @xmath23 , are respectively : @xmath24 and @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the degeneracy parameter , that is about -1.14 at the sun s centre , and decreases noticeably toward the surface , the partial degeneracy being completely removed at @xmath27 .",
    "the behaviour , as functions of the fractional radius , of the relative differences between the quantities @xmath1 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 calculated with relativistic corrections and without them is shown in fig . 1 .",
    "the term @xmath28 , in eq.(2 ) is negligible with respect to @xmath29 indicating that the relativistic corrections to the pressure , p , and density , @xmath23 , cancel each other almost completely and the correction to @xmath22 is entirely dominated by the correction to @xmath1 .",
    "also the term @xmath30 in eq.(3 ) is negligible with respect to unity , indicating that in the solar case the coupling between degeneracy and relativistic effects is weak .",
    "we used the latest golf / soho data for @xmath0 obtained with long time series and by taking into account the asymmetric line profile in data reduction ( thiery _ et al . _",
    "in particular , we determined the acoustic mode small spacing difference @xmath31 for @xmath4 and @xmath5 for our solar model , and studied the difference @xmath32 between data and model .",
    "we then constructed the two @xmath8 indicators ( dziembowski _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , schlattl _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) @xmath33 where @xmath34 stands for @xmath4 , m = 10 and m = 26 .",
    "fig . 2 and fig . 3",
    "show the behaviour of the terms in the sum defined in eq.(4 ) in non - relativistic and relativistic cases for mhd and opal eos respectively .",
    ".@xmath8 results in non relativistic ( nr ) and relativistic ( rel ) cases for mhd and opal eos . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the difference between the relativistic and non relativistic case is larger for @xmath35 in the frequency range beetwen @xmath36 and @xmath37 @xmath38hz , and for @xmath39 beetwen @xmath37 and @xmath40 @xmath38hz . the @xmath8 results are shown in table [ t1 ] where it is possible to note that the models with relativistic corrections have rather smaller @xmath41s and there is no significant difference between @xmath42 and @xmath43 calculated for opal and mhd eos .",
    "however , mhd eos appears to be slightly favoured with respect to opal eos .",
    "our results show that the acoustic mode frequency small separations are sensitive to the inclusion of the relativistic effects . it would be interesting to discuss the relevance of these effects in the helioseismic determination of the solar age and related problems with @xmath7 uncertainties .",
