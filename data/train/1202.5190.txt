    "the most recent results from the large hadron collider ( lhc ) keep the hopes for an imminent discovery of the higgs boson healthily alive .",
    "the search results based on an integrated luminosity of 4.9 @xmath1 are already available . while the mass range approximately between 115 and 127 gev can not be ruled out for a standard model ( sm ) higgs , the atlas collaboration reports hints of an excess around 125 gev , in both the @xmath2 and @xmath3 channels @xcite",
    ". it may be premature to read too much into this suggested ` peak ' , but it has quite understandably , raised hopes which are reflected in a large number of theoretical papers written since the announcement of the results @xcite .    as of now , the observed signal in , for example",
    ", the @xmath2 channel is more or less consistent with the standard model expectation , when the higgs mass is about 125 gev . at the same time",
    ", it is also important to know what the data implies for physics beyond the standard model .",
    "the very existence of a low - lying electroweak symmetry breaking sector raises the naturalness and triviality problems , and calls for new physics explanations for the stability of the electroweak scale .",
    "the scenario that has drawn maximum attention in this context is supersymmetry ( susy ) @xcite which in its minimal phenomenological form ( mssm ) is still awaiting a complete probe at the lhc .",
    "the fact that the lightest neutral higgs boson can at most be of mass about 135 gev makes the currently allowed higgs mass range a subject of even closer attention from the viewpoint of susy .",
    "the recent studies @xcite consider the implications of the higgs result in various susy scenarios .",
    "the present study is another step in this direction , where we have relaxed the requirement of any simplifying susy breaking scheme .",
    "the rate in the @xmath2 channel , having a small branching ratio , tends to get suppressed when other channels receive any substantial boost .",
    "it has been , therefore , argued that the visibility of the higgs in this channel can be reduced due to enhancement of the @xmath4 coupling ( where h is the lightest neutral cp - even scalar ) .",
    "this reduction can be compensated , for example , by enhancing the stop mixing angle or by reducing the lighter stau mass @xcite .",
    "the detailed study of mssm parameter space that survives the higgs mass window is presented in @xcite .",
    "if the lightest neutralino ( @xmath5 ) is stable , it can serve as a candidate for cold dark matter . at the same time",
    ", if its mass is less than half the higgs mass , the decay @xmath6 can have a large branching fraction , which in turn may also suppress the @xmath7 branching fraction .",
    "we can , therefore , use this information to restrict the mssm parameter space based on recent hints of higgs signatures .",
    "though , the importance of the @xmath8 has been pointed out in an earlier study @xcite , we would like to emphasize its special role when the lightest susy higgs lies in the region 123 - 127 gev in the light of the results from the atlas collaboration .",
    "we would also like to investigate whether it is possible to have sm - like rates in the @xmath2 channel even with significant invisible branching fraction . in order to have substantial invisible decay , with the higgs in the range 123 - 127 gev",
    ", the neutralino has to be less than @xmath9 50 - 60 gev .",
    "such values are consistent with the lep data and all other constraints in the purely phenomenological mssm .",
    "the most stringent bound on the mass of dark matter particle available till date is from the direct detection experiment xenon100 , which imposes bounds on the scattering cross - section versus wimp mass in the entire region upto 1 tev @xcite .",
    "recent analysis by cresst @xcite in the low mass region seems to corroborate dama / libra @xcite and cogent @xcite results in favouring light dark matter .",
    "given the stringent bounds in this region from xenon100 , there is an obvious tension in the result from the different dm detection experiments .",
    "we therefore consider the region with @xmath10 10 - 50 gev without imposing any dark matter related constraint . for a study based exclusively on dm constraint ,",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite . very recently , after the publication of atlas data , some study related to susy dark matter has been performed in @xcite .",
    "the questions we propose to answer in this study are as follows .",
    "first , do any regions of the mssm parameter space ( with @xmath11 ) , satisfy the higgs mass constraint and at the same time reproduce the measured signal strengths in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 channels ?",
    "second , what regions of mssm parameter space reproduce sm - like signal strengths in the @xmath2 channel .",
    "finally , whether it is still possible to have a significant invisible higgs decay when the higgs mass is within 123 - 127 gev and @xmath2 signal strength is unsuppressed .",
    "since the phenomenology pertaining to the higgs sector depends little on the gluino and the first two family sfermion masses , we have assigned large masses to these states , falling back on decoupling as the means of ensuring the suppression of flavour - changing neutral currents . in the same spirit , we have chosen @xmath12 to be completely free , and not imposed any condition as such radiative electroweak symmetry breaking to restrict it .",
    "it should be noted that , although our analysis is inspired by dark matter considerations , relying on a light neutralino lsp in the mssm , it also constrains the parameter space of r - parity violating susy as well ( where r - parity is defined by @xmath13 ) .",
    "while the violation of r - parity can render the lightest neutralino unstable and destroy its candidature for dark matter constituent , a light enough neutralino can still eat heavily into the decay width of the lightest higgs @xmath14 and thereby reduce its decay rate in the @xmath2 channel .",
    "therefore , if the data on this channel from the lhc continue to maintain the current trend , this channel may successfully probe an r - parity violating susy scenario as well .    the strategy adopted for our analysis",
    "is outlined in section 2 .",
    "section 3 contains the constraints we are able to derive on the mssm parameter space , with the lightest neutral higgs capable of decaying into a pair the lightest neutralino .",
    "we summarise and conclude in section 4 .",
    "as has been already stated , we primarily focus on the @xmath2 data published recently .",
    "the rates in loop - suppressed channels such as @xmath2 get substantially affected if the tree - level couplings of the higgs are altered due to physics beyond the standard model . however , in certain regions of the model parameter spaces , the interplay between the production cross - section and branching ratio can reach an overall rate close to , or , even greater than the sm prediction .",
    "our aim is to first identify such regions in the mssm parameter space , and then to check if a substantial invisible branching ratio of the higgs in these regions is still possible .    for calculating the higgs masses and mixing in the mssm",
    ", we have used the code feynhiggs v @xmath15 @xcite which has full two - loop results @xcite .",
    "first , we scan the mssm parameter space and select only those points for which the mass of the lightest neutral scalar higgs ( @xmath16 ) in the range 123 - 127 gev . for any given value of @xmath17 ,",
    "the ratio of the vacuum expectation values ( vev ) of the two higgs doublets , the neutral pseudoscalar higgs mass ( @xmath18 ) is varied appropriately to achieve this , and a scan over the permissible values of @xmath18 is performed in our analysis .",
    "it should be kept in mind that @xmath16 in the aforementioned range is crucially dependent on radiative corrections to the potential , largely derived by the top quark and its superpartner .",
    "two - loop corrections to the scalar potential are included for this purpose .",
    "the gluino mass has been fixed at 2 tev .",
    "squarks of the first two families , too are held fixed at a high mass of 2 tev , just for simplicity , since they have little bearing on the phenomenology of the higgs at the lhc .",
    "the sleptons are all held fixed at 800 gev , and the diagonal elements of the stop and sbottom mass matrices , at 1 tev .",
    "the quantities that have been adjusted to obtain the lightest neutral higgs mass in the desired band are @xmath17 and @xmath19 , the trilinear soft susy breaking parameter in the stop sector .",
    "the @xmath20-parameters in all other sfermion sectors are set to zero .    with the above choice of parameters , we next watch the role of the invisible channel @xmath21 .",
    "in particular , we ask the question : is it possible to be consistent with the current lhc data but still be consistent with a substantial invisible branching fraction for @xmath14 ? for this , first of all , one requires @xmath22 . secondly , the composition of @xmath23 is important in determining the invisible branching ratio .",
    "though @xmath12 on the lower side is mostly helpful for this purpose , we vary it over the entire range 100 gev - 1 tev , taking care at the same time to confine @xmath16 to the pre - decided range .",
    "we hold the @xmath24 , the u(1 ) gaugino mass at the representative value of 50 gev and vary @xmath25 , the su(2 ) gaugino mass across 100 - 500 gev .",
    "we have checked that the conclusions do not differ significantly for values of @xmath24 in the range 10 - 50 gev .",
    "two values of @xmath17 , namely , 10 and 40 , are used .",
    "we use low - scale values of all parameters in our scan .",
    "it should be noted that the branching ratio for @xmath26 can be as low as 7 - 10% in some regions of the parameter space .",
    "this is done most effectively through appropriate values of the stop mixing parameter @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , the effect attempted in reference @xcite , namely , reducing the @xmath27 decay width as much as possible , is included in our analysis .",
    "the results presented in the conference note corresponding to the atlas analysis @xcite for 4.9 fb@xmath28 data give the signal strengths in individual channels where an excess over the background has been observed .",
    "since the production and decay kinematics for susy higgs are not different from a sm higgs , we assume that the detector efficiency remain the same and therefore the signal in case of a susy higgs can simply be obtained by taking the ratio of the production cross section and the branching ratios in the channel under consideration .",
    "the dominant higgs production channel is @xmath29 .",
    "substantial increase to @xmath30 can also be observed in certain regions of parameter space .",
    "the next highest contribution to the cross section is in the vector - boson fusion channel which contributes to less than 8% of the total .",
    "we therefore use the nlo calculation of @xmath29 and @xmath31 available in feynhiggs to calculate the ratio @xmath32 defined by :    @xmath33_{mssm}}{[\\sigma(pp \\rightarrow h)\\times br(h \\longrightarrow \\gamma\\gamma)]_{sm}}\\ ] ]    a similar quantity , named @xmath34 , is defined for higgs decay into the four - lepton channel via a real and a virtual z. since these two are the primary channel in which a signal has been observed , we use these ratios in the next section to determine the favoured mssm parameter space and the correlation to the invisible higgs branching ratio .",

    "it should also be mentioned that the scatter plots in the @xmath58 space are not appreciably different when one reduces the mass of the lightest neutralino to 10 gev .",
    "thus our conclusions are unaltered even for a relatively light dark matter candidate .    for investigating the invisible higgs branching ratio",
    ", we fix our attention primarily on the @xmath2 channel as it currently has much better statistics than the @xmath59 channel . the sm higgs decay width into two photons",
    "is dominated by the w - boson and top loops . in the mssm case , extra contributions from stop / sbottom and chargino loops also play a crucial role .",
    "the last mentioned diagram contributes appreciably only when the lighter chargino is not too heavy ( to avoid mass suppression ) , and at the same time is a nearly equal admixture of gaugino and higgsino states ( to maximize the coupling ) .",
    "this leaves us with a rather small region with @xmath60 200 gev , where the results are at all sensitive to @xmath25 .",
    "otherwise , the dependence of @xmath56 on @xmath25 is hardly noticeable .",
    "this is reflected in the left panel of fig .",
    "the second panel , on the other hand , confirms that there is considerable sensitivity of @xmath56 on @xmath18 , due to it s effect on the w - loop contribution via the @xmath61 couplings .",
    "the dependence on @xmath12 also , is significant , as both the panels show .",
    "one of the reasons is because of the contributions of the sbottom loop to the @xmath62 decay width .",
    "as we have set the parameter @xmath63 to zero , the large values of @xmath12 serve as large off - diagonal terms in the sbottom mass matrix and result in one low - mass sbottom state . the sbottom loop contribution to both higgs production and",
    "its decay into two photons goes up in the process .",
    "consequently , one is able to have @xmath56 close to unity and above , by enhancing the value of @xmath12 .     in ( left ) @xmath64 and ( right )",

    "_ however , if the @xmath78 rate is larger than the sm rate , any invisible component is likely to be very small and undetectable .",
    "we have performed a completely phenomenological analysis , based on mssm without any model assumptions , of the recent data on higgs search in the @xmath2 and @xmath59 final states , demanding that the lightest neutral higgs mass be in the range 123 - 127 gev . the very condition of this mass restriction imposes a considerable constraint on the parameter space when two - loop corrections to the scalar potential are included .",
    "further , we have analysed the parameter space to identify regions where the @xmath2 rate is close to what is expected with standard model higgs of mass 125 gev .",
    "we also compare the @xmath2 and @xmath59 rates from the allowed mssm parameter space to the observed data and to the expected sm rates .",
    "once the higgs mass is decided , the two quantities that most crucially affect the @xmath78 rates are @xmath12 , the higgsino mass parameter , and @xmath18 , the neutral pseudoscalar mass .",

    "it is found that , inspite of a mild anti - correlation between the two effects , one can still have @xmath56 not too far away from unity and at the same time the invisible higgs decay branching ratio around 10% in certain regions of the mssm parameter space .    when a positive signal for the higgs boson is seen , and the rate in a suppressed channel like the two - photon one is found to be close to what the standard model predicts , it is common to assume that a new physics scenario that entails new decay modes of the higgs is disfavoured .",
    "our study reveals that it is not so in the phenomenological mssm , and that even measurable invisible decay widths of the lightest neutral higgs can coexist with otherwise sm - like signals .",
