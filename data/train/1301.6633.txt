    "the study of event - by - event fluctuations and correlations is an important tool to understand thermalization and phase transitions in heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "non - monotonic change in transverse momentum ( @xmath0 ) correlations as a function of centrality and/or the incident energy has been proposed as a possible signal of quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) formation  @xcite .",
    "the qgp is believed to be formed at the early stage of high energy heavy - ion collisions when the system is hot and dense .",
    "as time passes , the system dilutes , cools down and hadronizes .",
    "fluctuations are supposed to be sensitive to the dynamics of the system , especially at the qgp to hadron gas transition  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , analyses at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) based on @xmath0 auto - correlations ( the inversion of the mean transverse momentum fluctuations in various pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle difference regions of the produced particles ) indicate that the basic correlation mechanism could be dominated by the process of parton fragmentation  @xcite .",
    "thus fluctuation measurements are proposed to be an important tool in understanding nucleus - nucleus collisions  @xcite . in addition , under the assumption that thermodynamics is applicable to heavy - ion collisions , fluctuations in various observables could be related to thermodynamic properties of the matter formed .",
    "for example , the event - by - event @xmath4 could be related to temperature fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "the study of event - by - event fluctuations of various quantities such as eventwise mean transverse momentum ( @xmath4 ) , charged track multiplicity , and conserved quantities such as net - baryon and/or net - charge number are considered to be some of the main probes in the search for the critical point in the qcd phase diagram  @xcite .",
    "one expects enhanced fluctuations in the above observables when the system passes through the vicinity of the critical point .",
    "recent results from the cern super proton synchrotron ( sps ) experiments show that the energy dependence of transverse momentum fluctuations does not show the increase expected for freeze - out near the critical point of qcd  @xcite .",
    "however , when these fluctuations are studied as a function of the system size ( colliding c+c , si+si , pb+pb ) , enhanced fluctuations are observed in smaller colliding systems  @xcite .",
    "the results from the rhic beam energy scan ( bes )  @xcite data for the above observables will provide further insights .",
    "the results presented here are from cu+cu collisions at @xmath1  62.4 and 200 gev using the solenoidal tracker at rhic ( star ) and are compared with the published results from au+au collisions at the same energies  @xcite .",
    "this paper describes a systematic study of the system size dependence of the transverse momentum correlations observed at rhic .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the star detector , the data set , and the centrality selection used in the analysis , are discussed in sec .",
    "ii . in sec .",
    "iii , we discuss @xmath4 fluctuations extracted from the @xmath4 distributions , which are compared with mixed events and gamma distributions .",
    "dynamical fluctuations are extracted and presented for au+au and cu+cu collisions at @xmath5  62.4 and 200 gev .",
    "the @xmath6 correlations and the dynamical correlations when scaled by @xmath7 and @xmath4 are discussed in sec .",
    "iv , to understand the centrality and energy dependence .",
    "experimental data is also compared to various model calculations .",
    "finally , a detailed study of @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath6 dependence of the correlations , is presented .",
    "the systematic errors associated with the analysis are discussed in sec .",
    "v. we conclude with a summary in sec . vi .",
    "the cu+cu data were taken using the star detector with a minimum bias trigger . for the data taken at @xmath5 200 gev this was done by requiring a coincidence from the two zero degree calorimeters ( zdcs ) .",
    "for the @xmath5 62.4 gev data , the zdc is less efficient , so a beam beam counter ( bbc ) coincidence was also required .",
    "more details about the trigger detectors can be obtained from ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the main detector used in this analysis is the time projection chamber ( tpc )  @xcite , which is the primary tracking device in star .",
    "the tpc is 4.2 m long and 4  m in diameter and its acceptance spans about @xmath81.0 units of pseudorapidity and full azimuthal coverage .",
    "the sensitive volume of the tpc contains p10 gas ( 10% methane , 90% argon ) regulated at 2 mbar above atmospheric pressure .",
    "the tpc data are used to determine particle trajectories , momenta , and particle - type through ionization energy loss ( @xmath9 )  @xcite .",
    "the primary vertex of events used in this analysis is required to be within @xmath8 30 cm of the geometric center of the tpc along the beam axis .",
    "this selection process provides about 7.5 @xmath10 @xmath11 and 15 @xmath10 @xmath11 minimum bias events for cu+cu collisions at @xmath1 62.4 and 200 gev , respectively .",
    "the collision centralities are represented by the fractions of events in the minimum bias inelastic cross section distribution in a collision . in data ,",
    "the collision centrality is determined by using the uncorrected charged track multiplicity ( @xmath12 ) , measured in the tpc within @xmath13 0.5 .",
    "the various centrality bins are calculated as a fraction of this multiplicity distribution starting at the highest multiplicities .",
    "the centrality classes for cu+cu collisions at @xmath1 62.4 and 200 gev are 0%10% ( most central ) , 10%20% , 20%30% , 30%40% , 40%50% and 50%60% ( most peripheral ) . each centrality bin is associated with an average number of participating nucleons ( @xmath14 ) obtained using glauber monte carlo simulations  @xcite employing the woods - saxon distribution for the nucleons inside the cu nucleus .",
    "the systematic uncertainties include those determined by varying the woods - saxon parameters , those associated with the nucleon - nucleon cross sections , those related to the functional representation of the multiplicity distribution , and those associated with the determination of the total cu+cu cross section .",
    "table  [ tabcent62_5 ] lists the @xmath12 and @xmath14 values for each centrality in cu+cu collisions at @xmath1 62.4 and 200 gev .",
    "corresponding values for au+au collisions can be found in ref .  @xcite . in order to have uniform detector performance , a pseudorapidity cut of @xmath13 1.0",
    "is applied to tracks . to avoid the admixture of tracks from a secondary vertex ,",
    "a requirement is placed on the distance of closest approach ( dca ) between each track and the event vertex .",
    "the charged particle tracks are required to have originated within 1 cm of the measured event vertex .",
    "the multiple counting of split tracks ( more than one track reconstructed from the original single track ) is avoided by applying a condition on the number of track fit points ( @xmath15 ) used in the reconstruction of the track .",
    "each included track is required to have a minimum number of 21 tpc points along the track .",
    "the transverse momentum range selected for the analysis is 0.152.0 gev/@xmath16 .",
    "the errors shown in the figures have the statistical and systematic errors added in quadrature unless otherwise stated .",
    "the statistical errors are small and are within symbol sizes .",
    "the final systematic errors are obtained as quadrature sums of systematic errors from different sources as discussed in sec .",
    "the @xmath6 fluctuations in high energy collisions can be measured using the distribution of the event - wise mean transverse momentum defined as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the multiplicity of accepted tracks from the primary vertex in a given event and @xmath19 is the transverse momentum of the @xmath20 track .",
    "the mean-@xmath6 distribution is compared to the corresponding distribution obtained for mixed events  @xcite .",
    "mixed events are constructed by randomly selecting one track from an event chosen from the events in the same centrality and same event vertex bin .",
    "the mixed events are created with the same multiplicity distribution as that of the real events .",
    ".[tabcent62_5 ] the @xmath21 values and average number of participating nucleons ( @xmath14 ) for various collision centralities in cu+cu collisions at @xmath22 = 62.4 and 200 gev . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the @xmath6 correlations may also include short range correlations such as coulomb interactions and hanbury brown - twiss ( hbt ) correlations .",
    "these correlations usually dominate among pairs of particles having relative transverse momentum less than 100 mev/@xmath16 .",
    "the effect of these short - range correlations on the measured @xmath6 correlations is seen by calculating @xmath6 correlations after removing the pairs of particles with relative momentum ( @xmath23 ) , less than 100 mev/@xmath16 .",
    "the @xmath6 correlations are reduced by a maximum of 6% when short - range correlations are excluded .",
    "the @xmath6 correlations also include the contributions from resonance decays and charge ordering .",
    "these correlations are obtained for pairs of particles having like ( + + or @xmath24 ) and unlike ( @xmath25 ) charges with respect to inclusive charged particles .",
    "a maximum of 15% decrease in the correlations is observed for pairs of particles with like charges and about 12% increase is observed for pairs with unlike charges with respect to the correlations for inclusive charged particle pairs for cu+cu collisions at @xmath1 62.4 gev and 200 gev .",
    "we have reported measurements of @xmath0 fluctuations in cu+cu collisions in the star detector at rhic for @xmath5 62.4 and 200 gev , and compared with au+au collisions at the same energies to investigate the system size dependence .",
    "the dynamical @xmath0 fluctuations are observed by comparing data to mixed events in both cu+cu and au+au collisions at these two beam energies .",
    "moreover , for similar mean number of participating nucleons , the @xmath0 fluctuations are observed to be comparable for the cu+cu and au+au systems , suggesting that the system size has little effect .",
    "in addition , @xmath0 correlation measurements for cu+cu collisions at @xmath5 62.4 and 200 gev are compared with the published au+au measurements . for both cu+cu and au+au systems",
    ", the @xmath0 correlation decreases with increasing @xmath14 at both beam energies .",
    "the dilution of the @xmath0 correlations with increasing @xmath26 could be due to the decrease in correlations that are dominated by pairs of particles that originate from the same nucleon - nucleon collision .",
    "a similar observation is found with other fluctuation and correlation observables such as @xmath27  @xcite and net charge  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 correlations are found to scale with number of participating nucleon pairs for @xmath28 ( when the system size is larger than that of central cu+cu collisions ) .",
    "this might indicate the onset of thermalization  @xcite , the onset of jet quenching  @xcite , or the saturation of transverse flow in central collisions  @xcite .",
    "the square root of the @xmath0 correlations normalized by eventwise average transverse momentum for cu+cu and au+au collisions is similar for systems with similar @xmath26 and is independent of the beam energies studied .",
    "the results described above are compared to predictions from several relevant model calculations .",
    "the transport - based urqmd model calculations are found to have a better quantitative agreement with the measurements compared to models which incorporate only jet - like correlations as in hijing .",
    "hijing gives similar dependence on @xmath14 , but under predicts the magnitude .",
    "inclusion of the jet - quenching effect in hijing leads to a smaller value of the correlations in central collisions . a multiphase transport model calculation incorporating coalescence as a mechanism of particle production also compares well with data for central collisions .",
    "when studying the @xmath0 correlations for different @xmath0 intervals , the correlations appear to be small and fairly independent of @xmath0 interval , if the lower @xmath0 bound is fixed at 0.15 gev/@xmath16 and the higher @xmath0 bound is progressively increased up to 0.50 gev/@xmath16 .",
    "this suggests that correlations are weak for low-@xmath0 particles .",
    "this low-@xmath0 trend observed in the data is also seen in urqmd , ampt , and hijing models . when the analysis is carried out keeping the higher @xmath0 bound fixed at 2.0 gev/@xmath16 and progressively decreasing the lower @xmath0 bound to @xmath0 = 0.15 gev/@xmath16 , the correlation values in data",
    "are found to increase .",
    "this suggests that high @xmath0 particles are more correlated with low-@xmath0 particles .",
    "the ampt model shows a rather similar variation of @xmath0 correlations for different @xmath0 intervals , as observed in data .",
    "the urqmd model calculations , however , show no such variations in correlations for the different @xmath0 intervals with higher @xmath0 bound fixed at 2.0 gev/@xmath16 .",
    "finally , it is noted that the hijing model calculations give @xmath0 correlations that decrease with a decrease in the lower @xmath0 bound for intervals with fixed higher @xmath0 (= 2.0 gev/@xmath16 ) bound , i.e. , opposite to what is observed in data . regarding the changes in @xmath0 correlations in different @xmath0 intervals ,",
    "it is found that the resultant fluctuations after considering event - by - event variation in the slope of the @xmath0 spectra for different @xmath0 bins are all of similar order .    the variation of @xmath0 correlation with the change in the accepted range of pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle of the produced particles ,",
    "are also shown .",
    "the correlation values increase when the @xmath2- and the @xmath3-acceptance are reduced .",
