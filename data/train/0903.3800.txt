    "zero - modes are quasi - localized and the number of zero modes are determined by a size of background magnetic flux .",

    "thus , if they are localized far away from each other in the extra dimensional space , their four - dimensional couplings would be suppressed and such couplings would be useful to explain suppressed couplings in particle physics such as yukawa couplings of light quarks and leptons . hence , computation of those couplings is quite important . indeed , three - point couplings have been calculated and their results were found to coincide with three - point couplings in intersecting d - brane models  @xcite .",

    "our purpose in this paper is to compute higher order couplings in magnetized brane models .",
    "we carry out overlap integrals of three or more wavefunctions in the extra dimensional space in order to obtain higher order couplings in four - dimensional effective field theories .",

    "now , let us consider the four - point coupling of intersecting d - brane model corresponding to the left figure of fig .",
    "[ f : areap ] .",
    "the four - point amplitude is written as ( [ l - amp-2 ] ) , where the classical action corresponds to the area of the left figure . however , that can be decomposed into two triangles like the right figure , that is , the classical part can be decomposed into two parts , each of which corresponds to the classical part of three - point amplitude , i.e. @xmath247 where @xmath248 corresponds to the area of the left figure of fig .",
    "[ f : areap ] and @xmath249 and @xmath250 correspond to the triangle areas of the right figure .    on the other hand , our results in the previous sections show that the four - point coupling in the magnetized model is also expanded as ( [ sdecomp-2 ] ) .",
    "each of theta functions in ( [ sdecomp-2 ] ) corresponds to the classical parts of the three - point couplings in the intersecting d - brane models .",
    "this relation corresponds to the above decomposition ( [ decomp4 - 3 ] ) .",
    "thus , the theta function parts of the four - point couplings , i.e. the classical part , coincide each other between magnetized and intersecting d - brane models .",
    "that means that the holomorphic complex structure , @xmath193 , dependence of the four - point couplings in the magnetized brane models is the same as the holomorphic khler moduli @xmath235 dependence in the intersecting d - brane models , since the theta function part in the magnetized ( intersecting ) d - brane models depends only on @xmath193 ( @xmath235 ) .",
    "the other part in the magnetized brane models corresponds to normalization factors @xmath30 .",
    "when we take a proper normalization , these factors also coincide .",
    "we have calculated three - point and higher order couplings of four - dimensional effective field theory arising from dimensional reduction of magnetized brane models .",
    "we have found that higher order couplings are written as products of three - point couplings .",
    "this behavior is the same as higher order amplitudes of cft , that is , higher order amplitudes are decomposed as products of three - point amplitudes in intersecting d - brane models .",
    "our results on higher order couplings would be useful in phenomenological applications .",
    "numerical analysis on higher order couplings is also possible .",
