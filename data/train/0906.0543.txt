    "the winds and circumstellar environments of massive stars are unique laboratories for studying the detailed physics of stellar mass - loss mechanisms . in many luminous hot and cool supergiants large spectroscopic variability",
    "is observed on time - scales of weeks to years .",
    "long - term spectroscopic monitoring of massive - star variability over the past three decades therefore has provided a wealth of information about the driving physics and active structuring mechanisms in these stars with very extended winds .",
    "this paper provides a brief overview of important research results for a hot , intermediate , and cool supergiant obtained with advanced radiative transfer modeling of the spectroscopic variability .",
    "in recent years it has become clear that mass - loss rates of hot massive stars are considerably overestimated because the clumping of their winds has not been taken into account .",
    "understanding the physical nature of these wind clumping processes , determining the amount of wind clumping , and revising the total stellar mass - loss rates are therefore hot topics in current massive star research .",
    "detailed information about the wind structure can be obtained with accurate numerical models .",
    "we develop a parallel computer code wind3d which solves the 3-d transport of radiation in the scattering winds of massive stars .",
    "it calculates the detailed shape of resonance lines that form in very extended winds ( e.g. , p cygni profiles ) in non - lte .",
    "[ width=379pt , height=167pt]lobel_fig1.ps    we apply wind3d for the detailed modeling of dacs observed in the si  iv resonance lines of hd 64760 ( b0.5 ib ) , a key massive hot star .",
    "the study provides new evidence that the dacs are in fact large - scale spiraling density- and velocity - structures in the equatorial wind .",
    "these wind structures are due to rotating hotspots at the stellar surface .",
    "the bright spots do not co - rotate with the stellar surface , but lag five times behind the fast surface rotation .",
    "a hydrodynamic model with two spots of unequal brightness and size on opposite sides of the equator , with opening angles of 20@xmath4 @xmath55@xmath4  and 30@xmath4 @xmath55@xmath4  diameter , and that are 20@xmath55% and 8@xmath55% brighter than the stellar surface , respectively , provides the best fit to the observed dacs ( _ fig . 1 _ )",
    ". the mass - loss rate of the structured wind model does not exceed the rate of the spherically symmetric smooth wind model by more than 1% @xcite .",
    "yellow hypergiants are post - red supergiants , rapidly evolving toward the blue supergiant phase @xcite .",
    "they are among the prime candidates for progenitors of type ii supernovae in the galaxy . in july 2000",
    "we observed the formation of new tio bands in f - type hypergiant @xmath1 cas during a strong @xmath6-brightness decrease of @xmath7@xmath8 ( _ fig .",
    "2 _ ) . synthetic spectrum calculations reveal that @xmath9 decreased by at least 3000 k , from 7250 k to @xmath104250  k , and the spectrum became comparable to an early m - type supergiant .",
    "the tio bands signal the formation of a cool circumstellar gas shell with @xmath11@xmath12 k due to the supersonic expansion of the photosphere and upper atmosphere .",
    "we observe a shell expansion velocity of @xmath735@xmath52  @xmath13 from the tio bands . from the synthetic spectrum",
    "fits to the bands we compute an exceptionally large mass - loss rate of @xmath14@xmath105.4@xmath15@xmath16  @xmath17 , ( @xmath75% of @xmath18 in 200 d ) .",
    "it is therefore one of the largest stellar outburst events that has directly been monitored so far @xcite .",
    "the right - hand panel of fig .",
    "2 shows dynamic spectra of h@xmath19 and fe  i @xmath205572 observed between 1993 and late 2003 .",
    "the radial velocity curves of the h@xmath19 absorption core and the photospheric fe  i lines ( _ white dashed lines _ ) reveal a velocity stratified dynamic atmosphere .",
    "a strong collapse of the upper h@xmath19 atmosphere and the lower photosphere precedes the outburst event during the large - amplitude pre - outburst pulsation cycle of 1999 .",
    "based on radiative transport calculations @xcite presented a model for the near - ir co emission emerging from cool atmospheric layers in the immediate vicinity of @xmath1 cas photosphere .",
    "the gas kinetic temperature minimum in the model results from a periodical pulsation - driven shock wave .",
    "1-d models of the thermodynamic and dynamic structure of @xmath19 ori s photosphere and inner chromosphere ( to @xmath710 @xmath21 ) are developed in @xcite .",
    "modern methods in radiative transfer modeling venture well beyond outdated approaches that , for example , can only consider escape probabilities and radio fluxes .",
    "the latter flux - integrated models completely fail to produce fundamental chromospheric lines ( e.g. , balmer h , and mg  ii , ca  ii , k  i resonance lines , etc . ) .",
    "accurate models ( 1-d or multi - d ) for these important spectral lines are required for unraveling the wind - driving mechanism and related heating physics in the outer atmospheres of cool stars .",
    "the transport of radiation does not discriminate between so - called ` warm and cool gas components ' . in transfer calculations",
    "( irrespective of the number of dimensions ) , the model temperature and electron density structures ( @xmath22 ) must properly excite chromospheric absorption ( e.g. , h@xmath19 , h@xmath23 ) and emission lines , including the central self - reversals of optically thick emission lines . the model in fig .",
    "3 shows the radial mean values of @xmath11 and @xmath22 up to @xmath710 @xmath21 , based on detailed fits to the classical chromospheric indicators observed in @xmath19 ori .",
    "it correctly produces the observed near - uv emission line spectrum .",
    "a model without a gas kinetic temperature structure increasing to @xmath75550 k in the inner chromosphere can not excite the subordinate h@xmath19-transition of @xmath7300 m .",
    "the entire absorption line would become invisible with respect to strong tio absorption in the cooler photosphere @xcite .",
    "the mg  ii @xmath24 & @xmath25 emission lines would also vanish .",
    "the fully intensity - saturated self - scattered cores of these broad lines ( about the strongest chromospheric emission lines observed in any cool star ) result from a very large column of ( warm ) chromospheric plasma that dominates the overall gas kinetic temperature- and density - structure of the inner chromosphere",
    ". a much steeper outwardly decrease of @xmath22 ( i.e. , by an order of magnitude over 2 @xmath21 ) yields too large decrements of total widths computed for spatially resolved chromospheric emission lines .",
    "large variations of chromospheric emission line widths are consistently not observed in spatially resolved raster scans across the inner chromosphere with hst-@xmath3 in 1998@xmath21999 .",
    "the macro - broadening velocity is supersonic ( 9@xmath51 @xmath13 ) , and observed to be highly isotropic and homogeneous @xcite across the inner chromospheric disk .",
    "detailed transfer fits to the temporal variability and spatial intensity reversals observed in the emission line components of si  i @xmath202516 reveal that the inner chromosphere oscillates asymmetrically with simultaneous up - and downflow ( @xmath54 @xmath13 ) across the front hemisphere ( _ fig .",
    "interestingly , @xcite recently presented 3-d hydrodynamic models with large asymmetric movements of the photosphere and strong ( @xmath26@xmath272 ) radially propagating shock waves .",
    "strong shock waves are an efficient mechanism for transporting mechanical momentum very far from the stellar surface .",
    "they can support the co - existence of dust - sustaining low - temperature conditions ( @xmath28@xmath10600 k ) and ( possibly shock - excited ) chromospheric emission lines observed with @xmath3 far inside the circumstellar dust envelope ( _ fig .",
    "5 _ ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) up to 3@xmath29 ( @xmath27100 @xmath21 ) .",
    "mechanical wave action ( provided by circumstellar density waves , propagation of pressure waves , and astrophysical turbulence ) due to atmospheric pulsation is a very important aspect for studying the detailed physics of active structuring , acceleration , and heating mechanisms of the extended winds and circumstellar environments of hot and cool massive stars .",
    "recent advances in quantitative spectroscopy that combine 3-d radiative transfer methods with multi - d hydrodynamic and semi - empiric modeling provide powerful new methods for pinpointing these mechanisms .    the contributions from many @xmath1 cas observers over the past 15 years are gratefully acknowledged .",
    "this research is based in part on data of @xmath19 ori obtained with the nasa / esa hubble space telescope , collected at the stsci , operated by aura inc .",
