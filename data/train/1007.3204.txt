    "inflation is now considered to be a crucial part of the cosmological history of the universe @xcite , however the so called `` standard model of the universe '' still faces the problem of the initial singularity .",
    "such a singularity is unavoidable if inflation is realized using a scalar field while the background spacetime is described by the standard einstein action @xcite . as a consequence",
    ", there has been a lot of effort in resolving this problem through quantum gravity effects or effective field theory techniques .    a potential solution to the cosmological singularity problem",
    "may be provided by non - singular bouncing cosmologies @xcite .",
    "such scenarios have been constructed through various approaches to modified gravity , such as the pre - big - bang @xcite and the ekpyrotic @xcite models , gravity actions with higher order corrections @xcite , braneworld scenarios @xcite , non - relativistic gravity @xcite , loop quantum cosmology @xcite or in the frame of a closed universe @xcite .",
    "non - singular bounces may be alternatively investigated using effective field theory techniques , introducing matter fields violating the null energy condition @xcite leading to observable predictions too @xcite , or introduce non - conventional mixing terms @xcite .",
    "the extension of all the above bouncing scenarios is the ( old ) paradigm of cyclic cosmology @xcite , in which the universe experiences the periodic sequence of contractions and expansions , which has been rewaked the last years @xcite since it brings different insights for the origin of the observable universe @xcite ( see @xcite for a review ) .    on the other hand , the interesting idea of modifying gravity using lagrange multipliers ,",
    "first introduced in @xcite with bouncing solution studied in @xcite , was recently gained new interest , since its extended version may reduce irrelevant degrees of freedom in modified gravity models @xcite .",
    "in particular , using two scalar fields , one of which is the lagrange multiplier , leads to a constraint of special form on the second scalar field , and as a result the whole system contains a single dynamical degree of freedom .    in the present work we are interested in constructing a scenario of cyclic cosmology in universe governed by modified gravity with lagrange multipliers .",
    "we do that both in the case of scalar cosmology , as well as in the case of @xmath0-gravity , both in their lagrange - multiplier modified versions . as we show , the realization of cyclicity and the avoidance of singularities is straightforward .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ modgrav ]",
    "we present modified gravity with lagrange multipliers , separately for scalar cosmology ( subsection [ scalarmodel ] ) and for @xmath0-gravity ( subsection [ frmodgrav ] ) . in section [ cyclicity ]",
    "we construct the scenario of cyclicity realization , reconstructing the required potential ( subsection [ scalarcycl ] ) and the form of @xmath0 modification ( subsection [ frcyclic ] ) . in section [ stability ]",
    "we investigate the stability of the cosmological perturbations of the two scenarios .",
    "finally , section [ conclusions ] is devoted to the summary of our results .",
    "let us present the cosmological scenarios with lagrange multipliers . in order to be general and complete , we present both the scalar case , as well as the @xmath0-gravity one . throughout the work we consider a flat friedmann - robertson - walker geometry with metric @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the scale factor , although we could straightforwardly generalize our results to the non - flat case too .      in this subsection",
    ", we consider a scenario with two scalars , namely @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where the second scalar is a lagrange multiplier which constrains the field equation of the first one .",
    "the action reads @xcite : @xmath6+\\mathcal{l}_m   \\right\\ } ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the lagrange multiplier field .",
    "furthermore , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are potentials of @xmath4 , while the function @xmath9 and especially its sign determines the nature of the scalar field @xmath4 , that is if it is canonical or phantom . finally , the term @xmath10 accounts for the matter content of the universe .",
    "variation over the @xmath5-field leads to @xmath11 as we observe , this equation acts as a constraint for the other scalar field @xmath4 , and it is the cause of the significant cosmological implications of such a construction .",
    "now , the friedmann equations straightforwardly write @xmath12{\\dot\\phi}^2 + v(\\phi ) + \\lambda u(\\phi)\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\left [ \\omega(\\phi ) + 2\\lambda \\right ] u(\\phi ) + v(\\phi ) + \\rho_m,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath13{\\dot\\phi}^2 - v(\\phi ) - \\lambda u(\\phi)\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\omega(\\phi ) u(\\phi ) - v(\\phi)+p_m,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have defined the hubble parameter as @xmath14 , and we have also made use of the constraint ( [ constr1 ] ) .",
    "additionally , in these expressions @xmath15 and @xmath16 stand respectively for the energy density and pressure of matter , with equation - of - state parameter @xmath17 . observing the above equations",
    ", we can straightforwardly define the energy density and pressure for the dark - energy sector as @xmath18 u(\\phi ) + v(\\phi ) , \\\\   & & \\label{pde } p_{de}\\equiv \\omega(\\phi ) u(\\phi ) - v(\\phi),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and thus the dark energy equation - of - state parameter will be @xmath19 u(\\phi ) + v(\\phi ) } .\\ ] ]    let us now explore some general features of the scenario at hand following @xcite .",
    "first of all the constraint equation ( [ constr1 ] ) can be integrated for positive @xmath8 , leading to @xmath20 inverting this relation with respect to @xmath4 , one can find the explicit @xmath21-dependence of @xmath4 , that is the corresponding @xmath22 .",
    "thus , substituting the expression of @xmath22 into ( [ fr2 ] ) , we obtain a differential equation for @xmath23 : @xmath24 ^ 2   = -\\kappa^2\\left\\{\\omega(\\phi(t ) ) u(\\phi(t))\\right .",

    "finally , substituting @xmath22 and @xmath23 into ( [ fr1 ] ) , we can find the @xmath21-dependence of the lagrange multiplier field @xmath5 : @xmath25    however , one could alternatively follow the inverse procedure , that is to first determine the specific behavior of @xmath23 and try to reconstruct the corresponding potential @xmath7 , which is responsible for the @xmath4-evolution that leads to such a @xmath23 . in particular , he first chooses a suitable @xmath8 which will lead to an easy integration of ( [ tphi ] ) , allowing for an interchangeable use of @xmath4 and @xmath21 through @xmath26 .",

    "however , due to the constraint ( [ constr1 ] ) and the form in which the @xmath5-field appears in the action , the propagating modes of @xmath4 and @xmath5 do not appear , and the system is driven by a system of two first - order ordinary differential equations , one for each field . as a consequence , there are no propagating wave - like degrees of freedom and the sound speed for perturbations is exactly zero irrespective of the background solution @xcite .      in this subsection",
    "we present @xmath0-gravity with lagrange multipliers , following @xcite . in this case , we start by a conventional @xmath0-gravity , and we add a scalar field @xmath5 which is a lagrange multiplier leading to a constraint . in particular , the action reads : @xmath28\\right\\ } , \\ ] ] where @xmath29 and @xmath1 are two independent functions of the ricci scalar @xmath30 .",
    "note that in the above action we have not included the matter content of the universe , since this would significantly modify the multiplying terms of @xmath5 , making the subsequent reconstruction procedures technically very complicated .",
    "these subtleties are caused by the fact that the lagrange multiplier field propagates in this case , which is a disadvantage of the present scenario , contrary to the scalar cosmology of the previous subsection .",
    "variation over @xmath5 leads to the constraint @xmath31 additionally , varying over the metric @xmath32 and keeping the @xmath33-component we obtain    @xmath34    where @xmath35 denotes the derivative with respect to the ricci scalar .",
    "for @xmath36 , the constraint ( [ constrfr ] ) can be solved as @xmath37 and inverting this relation with respect to @xmath30 one can obtain the explicit @xmath21-dependence of @xmath30 , that is the corresponding @xmath38 .",
    "on the other hand , the ricci scalar is given from @xmath39 .",
    "thus , inserting @xmath38 in this relation one obtains a differential equation in terms of @xmath23 , namely @xmath40 ^ 2 = r(t),\\ ] ] the solution of which determines completely the cosmological behavior . finally , using the obtained @xmath23 and @xmath38 , equation ( [ frfrnew ] ) becomes a differential equation for the lagrange multiplier field @xmath41 which can be solved .",
    "however , one could alternatively follow the inverse procedure , that is to first determine the specific behavior of @xmath23 and try to reconstruct the corresponding @xmath1 , which is responsible for the @xmath30-evolution that leads to such an @xmath23 . in particular , with a known @xmath23 ( [ diffeqfr ] ) provides immediately @xmath38 , which can be inverted , giving @xmath42 . thus , using the constraint ( [ constrfr ] ) , the explicit form of @xmath1 is found to be @xmath43    it is interesting to mention that in the above discussion @xmath29 is arbitrary . that is , while in conventional @xmath0-gravity the cosmological behavior is determined completely by @xmath29 , in lagrange - multiplier modified @xmath0-gravity the dynamics is determined completely by @xmath1 . in this case",
    "@xmath29 would become relevant only in the presence of matter , and its effect on newton s law @xcite .",
    "having presented the cosmological models with lagrange multipliers , both in the scalar , as well as in the @xmath0-gravity case , in this section we are interested in investigating the bounce and cyclic solutions .    in principle , in order to acquire a cosmological bounce , one has to have a contracting phase ( @xmath44 ) , followed by an expanding phase ( @xmath45 ) , while at the bounce point we have @xmath46 . in this whole procedure",
    "the time - derivative of the hubble parameter must be positive , that is @xmath47 .",
    "on the other hand , in order for a cosmological turnaround to be realized , one has to have an expanding phase ( @xmath45 ) followed by a contracting phase ( @xmath44 ) , while at the turnaround point we have @xmath46 , and in this whole procedure the time - derivative of the hubble parameter must be negative , that is @xmath48 . observing the form of friedmann equations ( [ fr1 ] ) , ( [ fr2 ] ) , as well as of ( [ frfrnew ] )",
    ", we deduce that such a behavior can be easily obtained in principle . in the following two subsections",
    "we proceed to the detailed investigation in the case of scalar and @xmath0-modified cosmology .      in order to provide a simple realization of cyclicity in this scenario ,",
    "we start by imposing a desirable form of @xmath23 that corresponds to a cyclic behavior .",
    "we consider a specific , simple , but quite general example , namely we assume a cyclic universe with an oscillatory scale factor of the form @xmath49 where we have shifted @xmath21 in order to eliminate a possible additional parameter standing for the phase .",
    "furthermore , the non - zero constant @xmath50 is inserted in order to eliminate any possible singularities from the model .",
    "in such a scenario @xmath21 varies between @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and @xmath53 is just a specific moment without any particular physical meaning .",
    "finally , note that the bounce occurs at @xmath54 .",
    "straightforwardly we find : @xmath55}{\\left[a\\sin(\\omega t)+a_c\\right]^2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] concerning the matter content of the universe we assume it to be dust , namely @xmath56 , which inserted in the evolution - equation @xmath57 gives the usual dust - evolution @xmath58 , with @xmath59 its value at present .",
    "now , we first consider @xmath4 to be a canonical field , that is we choose @xmath60 . concerning the potential @xmath8 that will give as the solution for @xmath22 according to ( [ tphi ] ) , we choose a simple and easily - handled form , namely @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a constant with mass - dimension . in this case ,",
    "( [ tphi ] ) leads to @xmath63 having chosen the @xmath64 sign in ( [ tphi ] ) .",
    "as we have said in subsection [ scalarmodel ] , such a simple relation for @xmath22 allows to replace @xmath21 by @xmath65 in all the aforementioned relations .",
    "therefore , substitution of ( [ ht]),([hpt ] ) and ( [ uphiosc ] ) into ( [ vphit ] ) , and using @xmath4 instead of @xmath21 , provides the corresponding expression for @xmath7 that generates such an @xmath23-solution : @xmath66}{\\left[a\\sin\\left(\\omega \\frac{\\phi}{m^2}\\right)+a_c\\right]^2}\\right\\}\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left.\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\   \\ \\ \\   \\ \\ \\   + 3 \\left\\{\\frac{a\\omega\\cos\\left(\\omega \\frac{\\phi}{m^2}\\right)}{a\\sin\\left(\\omega \\frac{\\phi}{m^2}\\right)+a_c}\\right\\}^2 \\right\\ }   .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that in the case of dust matter , the reconstructed potential does not depend on the matter energy density and its evolution .",
    "finally , for completeness , we present also the @xmath41 evolution , which according to ( [ lambdat ] ) reads @xmath67}{\\left[a\\sin\\left(\\omega t\\right)+a_c\\right]^2}\\right\\}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\   \\ \\ \\   \\ \\ -\\frac{1}{m^4 } \\rho_{m0}\\left\\{a\\sin\\left(\\omega t\\right)+a_c\\right\\}^{-3 }   .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in order to provide a more transparent picture of the obtained cosmological behavior , in fig .",
    "[ ahscalar ] we present the evolution of the oscillatory scale factor ( [ at ] ) and of the hubble parameter ( [ ht ] ) , with @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , where all quantities are measured in units with @xmath71 .",
    "note that @xmath23 by construction satisfies the requirements for cyclicity , described in the beginning of this section .",
    "furthermore , in fig .  [ vscalar ]",
    "we depict the corresponding potential @xmath7 given by ( [ vphitosc ] ) . from these figures",
    "we observe that an oscillating and singularity - free scale factor can be generated by an oscillatory form of the scalar potential @xmath7 ( although of not a simple function as that of @xmath72 , as can be seen by the slightly different form of @xmath7 in its minima and its maxima ) .",
    "this @xmath7-form was more or less theoretically expected , since a non - oscillatory @xmath7 would be physically impossible to generate an infinitely oscillating scale factor and a universe with a form of time - symmetry .",
    "note also that , having presented the basic mechanism , we can suitably choose the oscillation frequency and amplitude in order to get a realistic oscillation period and scale factor for the universe .",
    "finally , we stress that although we have presented the above specific simple example , we can straightforwardly perform the described procedure imposing an arbitrary oscillating ansatz for the scale factor .",
    "the aforementioned bottom to top approach was enlightening about the form of the scalar potential that leads to a cyclic cosmological behavior .",
    "therefore , one can perform the above procedure the other way around , starting from a specific oscillatory @xmath7 and resulting to an oscillatory @xmath72 , following the steps described in the first part of subsection [ scalarmodel ] . as a specific example we consider the simple case @xmath73 with @xmath8 chosen as in ( [ uphiosc ] ) and thus ( [ phitosc ] ) holds too . despite the simplicity of @xmath7 , the differential equation ( [ diffht ] )",
    "can not be solved analytically , but it can be easily handled numerically . in fig .",
    "[ ahscalar2 ] we depict the corresponding solution for @xmath23 ( and thus for @xmath72 ) under the ansatz ( [ vtspec ] ) , with @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , with @xmath77 and @xmath78 ( in units where @xmath71 ) .",
    "as expected , we do obtain an oscillatory universe .      in order to provide a simple realization of cyclicity in this scenario ,",
    "we start by imposing a desirable form of @xmath23 that corresponds to a cyclic behavior . due to the complicated structure of the reconstruction procedure",
    ", we will choose an easier ansatz comparing to the previous subsection , which allows for the extraction of analytical results .",
    "in particular , having described the general requirements for an @xmath23 that gives rise to cyclic cosmology in the beginning of the present section , we choose @xmath23 ( and not @xmath72 ) to be straightaway a sinusoidal function , that is @xmath79 which gives rise to a scale factor of the form @xmath80,\\ ] ] which is oscillatory and always non - zero . inserting ( [ htfr ] ) and its derivative into ( [ diffeqfr ] ) we obtain @xmath38 as @xmath81 a relation that can be easily inverted giving @xmath82,\\nonumber\\ ] ] where we have kept the plus sign in the square root . finally , @xmath1 can be reconstructed using ( [ f2rrecon ] ) , leading to @xmath83 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in summary , such an ansatz for @xmath1 produces the cyclic universe with scale factor ( [ atfr ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath1 has a remarkably simple form , and this is an advantage of the scenario at hand , since in conventional @xmath0-gravity one needs very refined and complicated forms of @xmath0 in order to reconstruct a given cosmological evolution @xcite . however , as we stated in the beginning of subsection [ frmodgrav ] , in the @xmath0-version of lagrange - modified gravity one can not incorporate the presence of matter in a convenient way that will allow for an analytical treatment .",
    "the absence of matter evolution in a cyclic scenario is a disadvantage , since we can not reproduce the evolution epochs of the universe",
    ". therefore it would be necessary to construct a formalism that would allow for such a matter inclusion , similarly to the case of lagrange - multiplier modified scalar - field cosmology .",
    "such a project is in preparation .",
    "a central issue in all cyclic models is the stability analysis of the cosmological perturbations along with background evolution . in newtonian",
    "gauge the linear metric perturbation is given by @xmath84 where the variable @xmath85 is the so - called newtonian potential which describes the scalar part of metric perturbation . in the following",
    "we will study the evolution of the newtonian potential near the bouncing point , for the two above scenarios respectively .",
    "an explicit analysis on the newtonian potential of the scenario of scalar cosmology with lagrange multiplier was performed in @xcite .",
    "a very remarkable feature of this model is that the system possesses no wavelike modes and thus the sound speed of perturbations is identically zero in all backgrounds . by virtue of this particular property",
    ", it could be possible to control the dangerous growth of unstable modes of cosmological perturbations in the contracting phases of the cyclic universe .",
    "assuming that there is no anisotropic stress in our model , then @xmath86 .",
    "consequently , we only have one degree of freedom of cosmological perturbations . according to the analysis of @xcite ,",
    "one deduces that when the background evolution is dominated by the scalar field @xmath4 , the perturbation equation of the newtonian potential can be expressed as @xmath87 where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath88 .",
    "note that the dust - like sound speed @xmath89 has been applied to eliminate the gradient term .",
    "equation ( [ phiddot1 ] ) yields the generic solution @xcite @xmath90 which is applicable in all scales .",
    "thus , in this solution there are two modes @xmath91 and @xmath92 , which are arbitrary functions of spatial coordinates , and their explicit forms can be determined by certain boundary conditions .    observing the second term of the right - hand - side of ( [ phi1 ] )",
    ", one may concern that the newtonian potential might be divergent on the bouncing point , when @xmath46 .",
    "fortunately , this does not happen in a generic bounce model . as it was shown in phenomenological studies of generic bounce scenarios @xcite",
    ", one can impose an approximate parametrization of the hubble parameter as a linear function of the cosmic time , that is @xmath93 , nearby the bouncing point @xmath94 , with @xmath95 being a positive constant . doing so , in the neighborhood of a bounce in a specific cycle the newtonian potential can be solved as @xmath96    + s \\frac{\\xi t}{a_b}e^{-\\frac{\\xi t^2}{2 } } ,    \\label{phibb}\\ ] ] where @xmath97 is the value of the scale factor at the bouncing point .",
    "relation ( [ phibb ] ) presents convergent behavior , and thus the perturbations are able to pass through the bounce smoothly and without any pathology .",
    "therefore , the scenario at hand indeed provides a satisfactory way to realize a cyclic picture without instability on its perturbations .",
    "when we are dealing with @xmath0-gravity with lagrange multiplier , we can not use the simplifying relation @xmath86 , even under the assumption of zero anisotropic stress .",
    "therefore , in order to study the number of degrees of freedom in this case it is convenient to expand the action into quadratic order , which can be formally expressed as    @xmath98~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath99 and @xmath100 denote the perturbed ricci scalar at first and second order respectively .",
    "moreover , @xmath101 is the perturbed constraint equation at first order , which form is given by @xmath102    in principle , one could worry since the above action involves two scalar modes and higher derivative terms , which could imply instabilities . however ,",
    "this is not the case since the higher derivative terms can be fixed by the perturbed constraint equations .",
    "in addition , the vanishing of the @xmath103 component of the perturbed einstein equation allows to eliminate one degree of freedom .",
    "therefore , there is still only one mode of metric perturbation which is able to propagate freely .    in the following",
    ", we would like to focus on the propagation of the metric perturbation around the bouncing point , which is crucial to the stability analysis of a cyclic scenario .",
    "for calculation convenience we assume that the bounce takes place slowly , and then the universe approaches a static phase around the bounce asymptotically . under this assumption we can obtain the kinetic terms of the perturbation equation , which take the following approximate form : @xmath104 in which @xmath105 .",
    "although this equation is far from a complete form , one can still extract a few important issues .",
    "namely , the sound speed of the perturbation is unity under the assumption of slow bounce , as it can be read from the coefficient before the gradient term .",
    "furthermore , we confirm that there exist only a single degree of freedom in the @xmath0 cosmology with lagrange multiplier .",
    "we mention here that we investigated the stability only under the assumption of slow bounce . and",
    "the result in this case illustrates that it is possible for the cosmological perturbation to evolve through the bounces .",
    "however , it is necessary to point out that a more complete and generic analysis should be performed in order to constrain the parameter space of the scenario .",
    "such a general analysis is left for future investigation .",
    "in this work we investigated cyclic evolutions in a universe governed by lagrange - multiplier modified gravity . in order to be more general",
    "we considered the scenario of modified gravity through lagrange multipliers in both scalar - field cosmology , as well as in @xmath0 one .    in the case of scalar cosmology",
    ", the use of a second field that is the lagrange multiplier of the usual scalar , leads to a rich cosmological behavior .",
    "in particular , one can obtain an arbitrary cyclic evolution for the scale factor , by reconstructing suitably the scalar potential .",
    "as expected , an oscillatory scale factor is induced by an oscillatory potential , and we were able to perform such a procedure starting either from the scale factor or from the potential .",
    "additionally , the matter sector can be also incorporated easily , and this is an advantage of the scenario , since it allows for the successful reproduction of the thermal history of the universe .    in the case of @xmath0-gravity , we considered a lagrange multiplier field and a second form @xmath1 .",
    "this scenario leads also to a rich behavior , and one can acquire cyclic cosmology by suitably reconstructing @xmath1 , which proves to be of a very simple form , contrary to the conventional @xmath0-gravity . however , the complexity of the model does not allow for the easy incorporation of the matter sector , since one can not extract analytical results , and this is a disadvantage of the construction .    in summary",
    ", we saw that lagrange - multiplier modified gravity may lead to cyclic behavior very easily , and the scenario is much more realistic in the case of scalar cosmology . since a necessary test of every cosmological scenario is to examine the evolution of perturbations through the bounce @xcite , we extended our analysis beyond the background level , in both scenarios we considered .",
    "for the case of scalar cosmology the perturbation behaves as a frozen mode without oscillations , since its sound speed is vanishing . for the case of @xmath0-gravity and under the assumption of slow bounce",
    ", we obtain a dynamical degree of freedom of which the sound speed is almost unity .",
    "thus , in conclusion , it is possible for the cosmological perturbation to evolve through the bounces .",
    "however , a more generic perturbation analysis , beyond the slow bounce assumption , is needed , but since it lies beyond the scope of this work it is left for future investigation .",

    "<S> we investigate cyclic and singularity - free evolutions in a universe governed by lagrange - multiplier modified gravity , either in scalar - field cosmology , as well as in @xmath0 one . in the scalar case </S>",
    "<S> , cyclicity can be induced by a suitably reconstructed simple potential , and the matter content of the universe can be successfully incorporated . in the case of @xmath0-gravity </S>",
    "<S> , cyclicity can be induced by a suitable reconstructed second function @xmath1 of a very simple form , however the matter evolution can not be analytically handled . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we study the evolution of cosmological perturbations for the two scenarios . for the scalar case the system possesses no wavelike modes due to a dust - like sound speed , while for the @xmath0 case there exist an oscillation mode of perturbations which indicates a dynamical degree of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> both scenarios allow for stable parameter spaces of cosmological perturbations through the bouncing point . </S>"
