    "many of the problems of interest to computation experts are , or are reducible to , decision problems . these are problems that for a given input require the determination of a yes or no answer to a specified question about the input .",
    "for example the traveling salesman problem is ( polynomial time ) equivalent to the decision problem that asks whether or not for a given set of intercity distances there is a route passing through all of the cities whose length is less than a given fixed length .",
    "another example that we will later use for concreteness in this paper is the @xmath2 integer programming problem called  exact cover\"@xcite .",
    "here we are given an @xmath3 by @xmath0 matrix , @xmath4 , all of whose entries are either 0 or 1 .",
    "the number of columns @xmath3 is @xmath5 .",
    "we are asked if there exists a solution to the @xmath3 equations @xmath6 with the @xmath7 restricted to be 0 or 1 . the brute force approach to this problem",
    "is to try the @xmath8 possible choices of @xmath9 . for each choice of @xmath10 , checking to see if eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) is satisfied takes at most of order @xmath11 operations , which is polynomial in the input size .",
    "however , checking all @xmath8 possible choices for @xmath10 is prohibitively time consuming even for moderately large values of @xmath0 .    for the exact cover problem , with a given instance of the input matrix @xmath4 , it is not actually necessary to check all @xmath8 values of @xmath10 to see if eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) can be satisfied . note that generically @xmath12 can take the values 0 or 1 and",
    "@xmath13 can have the values @xmath14 or @xmath15 . however , suppose that for some @xmath16 the matrix @xmath4 has @xmath17 . in this case",
    "the choice @xmath18 is eliminated and no @xmath10 of the form @xmath19 need be tried . if we consider @xmath10 s that begin with @xmath20 then if for some @xmath16 we have @xmath21 , then any @xmath10 beginning with @xmath20 is eliminated .",
    "we can picture this in terms of a decision tree as follows . before imposing any constraints we construct an underlying branching tree .",
    "this tree starts at the top with one starting node that branches to two nodes corresponding to the two choices for @xmath12 .",
    "this then branches to the four choices for @xmath13 and so on until we have all @xmath8 choices for @xmath22 at the @xmath23 level .",
    "however if we impose the constraints and see that a particular node is eliminated , then we can also eliminate all nodes connected to that node that lie below it in the tree .",
    "the decision tree is the underlying branching tree that has been trimmed as a result of the constraints .",
    "note that the exact cover problem has a solution if and only if the decision tree has one or more nodes left at the bottom ( @xmath23 ) level .",
    "more generally we view decision problems as having an underlying bifurcating branching tree with @xmath0 levels as in fig.[fig : figi ] . the specific form ( or instance ) of the problem imposes constraints that eliminates nodes from the tree as in fig.[fig : figii ] .",
    "when a node is excluded the whole branch with that node as its topmost point is also cut from the tree .",
    "the decision question we wish to answer is `` are there any nodes left at the @xmath23 level after all constraints have been imposed ? ''    consider a family of decision problems indexed by a size @xmath0 .",
    "particular instances of the problem of size @xmath0 give rise to particular decision trees that either have or do not have nodes at the @xmath23 level .",
    "the computational concern is how much time , or how many algorithmic steps , are required to answer the decision question as @xmath0 gets big . roughly speaking",
    "if the time grows like @xmath24 for fixed @xmath25 , the problem is considered easy whereas if the time grows like @xmath26 with @xmath27 , the problem requires an `` exponential amount of time '' and is considered computationally hard .",
    "one approach to solving a decision problem is to systematically check every path that starts at the top of the tree and moves downward through the tree .",
    "if a path reaches a dead end you try the next path ( in some list of paths ) until you find a path that has a node at the @xmath23 level or else , after having checked all paths , you discover that the answer to the decision question is  no \" .",
    "an alternative to systematically exploring the whole tree is to move through the tree with a probabilistic rule . for example you could use the rule that if you are at a given node you move to the other nodes that are connected to it with equal probability .",
    "thus if you are at a node that connects to two nodes below it you have a 1/3 chance of moving back up the tree ; if the node connects to just one below you have a 1/2 chance of moving back up whereas if the node is a dead end you definitely move back .",
    "if you start at the top of the tree and move with this probabilistic rule you will eventually visit every node in the tree .",
    "consider a family of decision trees that are associated with underlying branching trees that are @xmath0 levels deep .",
    "an individual instance of the decision tree either has or does not have nodes at the @xmath23 level . if it does have nodes at the @xmath23 level and we use a probabilistic rule for moving through the tree , then we say that the tree is penetrable if there is a good chance of reaching the @xmath23 level in not too great a time .",
    "more precisely we define the family of trees as penetrable if : @xmath28 this means that in polynomial time the probability of reaching the @xmath23 level is at worst polynomially small .",
    "if ( p ) is met , then by running the process order @xmath29 times we achieve a probability of order  1 of reaching the @xmath23 level in time @xmath30 .",
    "if ( p ) is not met it means that it either takes more than polynomial time to reach the @xmath23 level or the probability of reaching the @xmath23 level is always smaller than @xmath31 to any power . therefore if condition ( p ) is not met instances of the trees with nodes at the @xmath23 level can not practically be distinguished from instances with no nodes at the @xmath23 level . in this case",
    "the corresponding decision problem is not solvable in polynomial time by this algorithm",
    ". we will divide families of decision trees indexed by @xmath0 into two classes , those that satisfy ( p ) and those that do not , which we call impenetrable .",
    "we are interested in using quantum mechanics to move through decision trees .",
    "we imagine that nodes of the decision tree correspond to quantum states , which give a basis for the hilbert space .",
    "we further imagine constructing a hamiltonian @xmath32 with nonzero off - diagonal matrix elements only between states that are connected in the corresponding decision tree .",
    "( we will be more specific about constructing the hilbert space and @xmath32 later . )",
    "we start the quantum system in the state corresponding to the topmost node and let it evolve with its time evolution determined by @xmath32 so that the unitary time evolution operator  is @xmath33 at any time @xmath34 we have a pure state that can be expressed as a ( complex ) superposition of basis states corresponding to the nodes . given @xmath32 and the initial state , the probability ( the amplitude squared ) of finding the system at the @xmath35 level at time @xmath34 is determined .",
    "we then say that a family of trees indexed by size @xmath0 is quantum penetrable if condition @xmath36 is met and it is quantum impenetrable if condition @xmath36 is not met",
    ".    in the next section we will give a specific form for the quantum hamiltonian @xmath32 and then prove that any family of trees that is classically penetrable is associated with a closely related family of trees that is quantum penetrable .",
    "this will demonstrate that our model for quantum mechanically solving decision problems is at least as powerful as the classical probabilistic method .",
    "in section three we will go further and give an example of a family of decision trees that is classically impenetrable but which is quantum mechanically penetrable .",
    "this means that the quantum penetration is exponentially faster than the corresponding classical penetration for these trees .",
    "however , we have not yet identified general characteristics of a problem that guarantee that its associated decision trees are quantum penetrable .",
    "furthermore , for the example considered , the problem associated with the classically impenetrable trees can be reformulated so that it is computationally simple to solve by an alternative , classical method .    in section four",
    "we discuss the construction of the hilbert space and the hamiltonian @xmath32 .",
    "the usual paradigm for quantum computation@xcite envisages a string of , say , @xmath37 spin-1/2 particles that gives rise to a @xmath38-dimensional hilbert space .",
    "each elementary operation is a unitary transformation that acts on one or two spins at a time .",
    "we will show that the hilbert space for our system can be constructed using @xmath37 spin 1/2 particles just as in a conventional quantum computer .",
    "furthermore , for a large class of problems , the hamiltonian that we construct is a sum of hamiltonians that act on a fixed number of spins . in this sense@xcite",
    "our quantum evolution through decision trees lies in the framework of conventional quantum computation .",
    "in the introduction we discussed a classical ( that is , non - quantum ) probabilistic rule for moving through decision trees .",
    "here we are going to be more specific and state the rule in a way that gives rise to a continuous time markov process .",
    "the rule is simply that if you are at a given node then you move to a connected node with a probability per unit time @xmath39 where @xmath39 is a fixed , time independent , constant .",
    "this means that in a time @xmath40 where @xmath41 , the probability of moving to a connected node is @xmath42 . using a continuous time process , as opposed to saying that you move at discrete times , will make it easier when we compare with the continuous time evolution dictated by the unitary operator in ( [ eq:1.2 ] )",
    "we are now going to introduce some formalism that looks quantum mechanical but we are going to apply it to describe the classical markov process .",
    "suppose we are given a decision tree that has @xmath43 nodes .",
    "( @xmath43 may be as large as @xmath44 where @xmath0 is the number of levels . )",
    "index the nodes in some way by the integers @xmath45 .",
    "corresponding to the tree we construct an @xmath43-dimensional hilbert space that has an orthonormal basis @xmath46 with @xmath45 and accordingly @xmath47 .",
    "now we define a hamiltonian @xmath32 through its matrix elements in this basis : @xmath48    return to the classical probabilistic rule for moving through a fixed tree and let @xmath49 for a time @xmath40 where @xmath41 we have @xmath50 as a consequence of the definition of @xmath32 . for a classical markov process , the probability of moving depends only on current position , not on history , so we have for any @xmath51 and @xmath52 , @xmath53 therefore @xmath54 which for @xmath40 small gives @xmath55 where we have used ( [ eq:2.3 ] ) .",
    "we see therefore that @xmath56 obeys the differential equation @xmath57 with the boundary condition @xmath58 .",
    "the solution to ( [ eq:2.7 ] ) is @xmath59 again , @xmath56 given by ( [ eq:2.8 ] ) is the * classical * probability of going from @xmath60 to @xmath61 in time @xmath34 if you move through the tree with a probability per unit time @xmath39 of moving to a connecting node . as a check we should have that @xmath62 to see that this is the case note that @xmath32 defined by ( [ eq:3 ] ) has a zero eigenvector , @xmath63 therefore @xmath64   & = & 1 \\ \\ . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we have constructed the hamiltonian @xmath32 because of its utility in describing a classical markov process .",
    "we now propose using the same hamiltonian @xmath32 to quantum mechanically evolve through the tree .",
    "let @xmath65 be the quantum amplitude to be found at node @xmath61 at time @xmath34 given that you are at node @xmath60 at time @xmath66 . in this case",
    "the probability is @xmath67 with @xmath68 as a consequence of the fact that @xmath32 is hermitian . with this quantum hamiltonian",
    "we will now show that if a family of trees is classically penetrable then there is a related family of trees that is also quantum mechanically penetrable .",
    "imagine we are given a family of decision trees @xmath69 where each @xmath70 is @xmath0 levels deep and does have nodes at the @xmath0-th level .",
    "for simplicity we will take the worst case possible and assume that there is only one node at level @xmath0 . in order to establish our result",
    "we are going to consider another family of trees @xmath71 where each @xmath72 is obtained from @xmath70 by appending a semi - infinite line of nodes to the starting node of @xmath70 . the rule for classically moving on the semi - infinite line is the same as the rule for moving on the rest of the tree : with a probability per unit time @xmath39 you move to an adjoining node .",
    "we can see that if @xmath69 is classically penetrable",
    "so is @xmath71 . roughly speaking , starting at @xmath66 on @xmath72 , the probability of reaching the @xmath35 level",
    "is not appreciably reduced because of the time some paths spend on the semi - infinite line .",
    "( we now prove this statement , but the reader who is already convinced that it is true can skip to the next paragraph . )",
    "suppose that for @xmath69 we have condition ( p ) so that @xmath73 for some @xmath74 .",
    "at level 1 of the decision tree only one of the two nodes is on the branch that contains @xmath0 , the unique node at level @xmath0 .",
    "denote this level 1 node by @xmath75 .",
    "now for each path ( on @xmath76 that reaches @xmath0 from @xmath66 in time @xmath34 there is a time @xmath77 at which the path last jumps from @xmath66 to @xmath75 . thus @xmath78 using ( [ eq:16new ] )",
    "it follows that for some @xmath79 , @xmath80 however this last probability is the same for @xmath72 as for @xmath70 . turning to the trees @xmath72",
    "we see that the node @xmath66 is connected to three other nodes , the node at level @xmath81 on the semi - infinite tree and the two nodes at level @xmath82 . in time",
    "@xmath83 there is an @xmath0-independent lower bound on the probability of going from @xmath66 to @xmath75 . combining this fact with ( [ eq:18new ] ) we see that in a time @xmath84 there is a probability of going from @xmath66 to @xmath0 on @xmath72 which is greater that @xmath85 to a power .",
    "thus if @xmath86 is classically penetrable",
    "so is @xmath87 .",
    "we are now going to compare the classical and quantum evolution through the family of trees @xmath71 . from this point on we set @xmath88.we will return to finite trees later in this section but for now the device of appending a semi - infinite line to the trees of interest actually makes the analysis simpler .",
    "again call the starting node ( which is at level 0 of the tree @xmath72 ) @xmath66 and call the unique node at the @xmath35 level @xmath0 .",
    "then @xmath89 is the probability to go from @xmath66 to @xmath0 in time @xmath34 if you evolve with the classical rule .",

    "the fourth term connects the nodes @xmath312 at level  @xmath161 with the nodes @xmath374 at level  @xmath371 whereas the last term connects @xmath312 at level  @xmath161 with @xmath375 at level  @xmath371 .",
    "thus we see that @xmath155 can be written as a sum of @xmath376 each of which acts on at most three bits .",
    "we have built a hilbert space with @xmath377 states whereas the underlying branching tree has only @xmath378 nodes . however ,",
    "if we start in the state corresponding to the topmost node , that is , @xmath379 and all other bits  @xmath66 , then if we act with @xmath380 with @xmath155 given by ( [ eq:4.6 ] ) we only ever reach states in the subspace corresponding to the underlying branching tree .",
    "the @xmath377-dimensional hilbert space may not be the most economical choice to describe the tree but it suffices for our purpose of showing that @xmath155 can be built as a sum of local hamiltonians .",
    "of course we also want to construct @xmath155 as a sum of hamiltonians acting on a fixed number of bits for interesting trimmed decision trees .",
    "there are families of trimmed trees whose hamiltonians we can not represent in this way .",
    "but for many interesting problems we can write @xmath155 as a sum of hamiltonians that act on at most  @xmath121 bits , where @xmath121 does not grow with  @xmath0 . for example , we now show how to do this for a version of the exact cover problem discussed in the introduction .",
    "we restrict the matrix  @xmath4 , which defines an instance of the exact cover problem , to have exactly three  @xmath82 s in any row and three or fewer  @xmath82 s in any column .",
    "even with this restriction , the problem is np - complete .",
    "consider first the question of whether the @xmath311-level node @xmath312 connects to the @xmath381-level node @xmath375 .",
    "we assume that @xmath312 is in the tree and we need to be consistent with ( [ eq:1 ] ) so we know that for each  @xmath16 , @xmath382 is  @xmath66 or  @xmath82 .",
    "if for some  @xmath16 this sum is  @xmath82 and also @xmath383 , then @xmath375 is eliminated as a node .",
    "consider the function @xmath384a_{j , i+1 } + \\bigl[1-a_{j , i+1}\\bigr]\\bigr\\}\\ \\ . \\label{eq:4.7}\\ ] ] given that @xmath312 is an allowed node , then this function is  @xmath82 if @xmath385 is allowed and  @xmath66 if @xmath375 is excluded .",
    "furthermore , given the restriction that @xmath4 has three  @xmath82 s in any row and three or fewer in any column , @xmath386 has at most six @xmath7 s appearing .",
    "now we ask if @xmath312 at level  @xmath161 connects to @xmath374 at level @xmath371 .",
    "this connection will be allowed unless for some  @xmath16 with @xmath383 , there is a @xmath387 and a distinct @xmath388 such that @xmath389 and @xmath390 .",
    "the reason the node @xmath374 would be eliminated in this case is that there are exactly three @xmath82 s in any row and  ( [ eq:1 ] ) could not be satisfied if the three bits @xmath7 , @xmath391 , and @xmath392 are all  @xmath66 . now consider the function @xmath393 for any @xmath16 with @xmath383 , @xmath394 can be @xmath66 , @xmath395 or  @xmath182 . only if @xmath396 is @xmath374 eliminated",
    "let @xmath397a_{j , i+1 } + ( 1-a_{j , i+1})\\bigr\\}\\ \\ . \\label{eq:4.9}\\ ] ] then this function is  @xmath66 if @xmath374 excluded and it is  @xmath82 if @xmath374 is allowed . again because of the restrictions placed on  @xmath4 , this function has only six @xmath7 s appearing .",
    "the functions @xmath398 and @xmath386 can be promoted to operators simply by replacing their arguments by the bit operators @xmath399 defined in ( [ eq:4.5 ] ) , that is , we have @xmath400 and @xmath401 .",
    "if we multiply the last term in ( [ eq:4.6 ] ) by @xmath386 and the fourth term by @xmath398 , the hamiltonian has off - diagonal elements only where the tree has connections .",
    "similarly we can write the diagonal term as @xmath402 thus we have written the hamiltonian for the trees trimmed by  @xmath4 in the form  ( [ eq:4.2 ] ) with @xmath403 .    generally , we think of decision trees as associated with functions  @xmath309 that impose constraints : @xmath310 if the @xmath313 level node @xmath404 is connected to the @xmath311 level node @xmath312 ; otherwise @xmath405 .",
    "the exact cover example above makes clear that as long as there is a fixed  @xmath121 such that @xmath406 depends on only  @xmath121 bits for each  @xmath161 ( _ which _ bits can vary with  @xmath161 , of course ) then the problem can be implemented within the usual quantum computing paradigm  we only need to replace @xmath407 in ( [ eq:4.10 ] ) by @xmath408 and also to multiply the appropriate connection terms in ( [ eq:4.6 ] ) by @xmath409 .",
    "note that our example in section  3 for which the quantum algorithm achieved exponential speed - up does not meet this fixed-@xmath121 requirement .",
    "we do have , however , similar examples that achieve exponential speed - up and that do meet this requirement .",
    "these problems also rely on even - length , very structured bushes , and also can be solved quickly by other classical algorithms .",
    "there is great interest in devising quantum algorithms that improve on classical algorithms , and there have been some notable successes . for example , the well - known shor  @xcite and grover  @xcite algorithms demonstrate remarkable ingenuity .",
    "each uses quantum interference , the necessary ingredient for quantum speed - up , in what appears to be a problem - specific way .",
    "so far these methods have not been successfully applied to problems very different from the ones for which they were originally devised .    in this paper , we have considered a single time - dependent hamiltonian that evolves a quantum state through the nodes of a decision tree .",
    "( for a related approach , see @xcite . )",
    "this is in contrast to the usual setup consisting of a sequence of unitary operators each acting on a fixed number of bits .",
    "( for many problems , including np - complete ones , our algorithm can be rewritten in the conventional language of quantum computation . ) studying hamiltonian evolution on decision trees is facilitated by the technique of calculating energy - dependent transmission coefficients .",
    "the example in section three shows explicitly how interference allows a class of trees to be penetrated exponentially faster by quantum evolution than by classical random walk .",
    "however , this example can be quickly solved by a different classical algorithm .",
    "the particular hamiltonian we chose allowed us to prove , in section  two , that the quantum algorithm succeeded in polynomial time whenever the corresponding classical random walk on the decision trees succeeded in polynomial time . in searching for more examples where the quantum algorithm outperforms the classical algorithm ,",
    "one is not restricted to this hamiltonian .",
    "we can imagine trying any hamiltonian with nonzero off - diagonal elements where there are links between the nodes on the decision tree . with this flexibility , we hope that the class of trees that can be penetrated quickly by the quantum algorithm is large enough to include classically difficult problems .",
    "we thank francis low and mike sipser for their help and insights .",
