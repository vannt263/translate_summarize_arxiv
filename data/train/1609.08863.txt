    "these newtonian theory of tides has been imported to the general relativity @xcite , where it shows that the electric and magnetic type dimensionless gravitational love number is a part of the tidal field associated with the gravito - electric and gravitomagnetic interactions .",
    "the tidal interaction in a compact binary system has been encoded in the love number and is associated with the induced deformation responded by changing shapes of the massive body .",
    "we are particularly interested for a neutron star in a close binary system , focusing on the various love number @xmath0 ( @xmath1=2 , 3 , 4 ) due to the shape changes ( like quadrupole , octupole and hexadecapole in the presence of an external gravitational field ) .",
    "although higher love numbers ( @xmath1=3 , 4 ) give negligible effect , still these love numbers ( @xmath2 ) can have vital importance in future gravitational wave astronomy .",

    "the self- and crossed interactions are very significant .",
    "for example , the self - interaction of @xmath8meson brings back the nuclear matter incompressibility @xmath9 from an unacceptable high value of @xmath10600 mev to a reasonable @xmath9 of @xmath11270 mev @xcite .",

    "it is clearly illustrated that the maximum mass predicted by any theoretical models should reach the limit @xmath81 , which is consistent with our present prediction from the g2 equation of state of nucleonic matter compact star with mass 1.99@xmath82 and radius 11.25 km . from x - ray observation ,",

    "as explained to earlier , stiff eos like nl3 predicts larger stellar radius 13.23 km and a maximum mass 2.81 @xmath82 .",
    "though fsugold and fsugold2 are from the same rmf model with similar terms in the lagrangian , their results for neutron star are quite different with fsugold2 suggesting a larger and heavier ns with mass 2.12@xmath82 and radius 12.12 km compare to mass and radius ( 1.75@xmath82 and 10.76 km ) of the fsugold .",
    "because in fsugold2 eos at high densities , the impact comes from the quartic vector coupling constant @xmath83 and also the large value of the slope parameter l=112.8 @xmath8416.1 mev ( see table [ tab1 ] ) tend to predict the neutron star with large radius @xcite . from the observational point of view , there are large uncertainties in the determination of the radius of the star @xcite , which is a hindrance to get a precise knowledge on the composition of the star atmosphere .",
    "one can see that g2 parameter is able to reproduce the recent observation of 2.0@xmath82 ns .",
    "but the presence of hyperon matter under @xmath43-equilibrium soften the eos , because they are more massive than nucleons and when they start to fill their fermi sea slowly replacing the highest energy nucleons .",
    "hence , the maximum mass of ns is reduced by @xmath110.5 unit solar mass due to the high baryon density .",
    "for example , the stiffer nl3 equation of state gives the maximum ns mass @xmath112.81@xmath82 and the presence of hyperon - matter reduces the mass to @xmath112.25@xmath82 as shown in fig .",

    "probably , this suggest us to modify the coupling constants and get the equations of state proper , so that one can explain all the mass - radius observation till date .",

    "when spherical star placed in a static external quadrupolar tidal field @xmath90 then the star will be deformed and quadrupole deformation will be the leading order perturbation .",
    "such a deformation is defined as the ratio of the mass quadrupole moment of a star q@xmath91 to the external tidal field @xmath90 : @xmath92 specifically , the observable of the tidal deformability parameter @xmath59 depends on the eos via both the neutron star ( ns ) radius and a dimensionless quantity k@xmath93 , called the love number and is given by the relation : @xmath94 and the dimensionless tidal - deformability(@xmath24 ) is related with the compactness parameter @xmath95 as : @xmath96 where r is the radius of the ( spherical ) star in isolation .",
    "now , we have to get k@xmath93 for the calculation of the deformability parameter @xmath59 , which is the key quantity of deformation due to the gravitational attraction of the binary stars with each other .",

    "the orbital distance between the binary decreases as the companion star emits gravitational radiation . as a result ,",

    ", we mark an infinitely large @xmath59 corresponding to a small compactness i.e. @xmath1390.02 .",
    "further , the @xmath59 value falls to a minima that rises again resulting in a hump like pattern for each eos .",
    "it is noteworthy that in fig .",
    "[ fig7](b ) by introducing the nl3 case with hyperon , there is remarkable but mere deviation in @xmath59 value i.e 7.527 g @xmath140 s@xmath141 ( without hyperon @xmath59= 7.466 g @xmath140 s@xmath141 ) .",
    "since , the tidal deformability @xmath59 is a surface phenomenon , it is very much getting affected by the radius of the star in both normal neutron star and hyperon star .",
    "thus , the tidal deformability @xmath59 becomes highly sensitive on the radius @xmath78 even though @xmath136 is small .",
    "we estimate the radii to be within 12.236@xmath14214.422 km for a neutron star of mass 1.4@xmath82 and the range is 13.690@xmath14214.430 km for neutron - hyperon star for all the four stiff or soft equations of state ( see table [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "[ fig8 ] , shows the tidal deformability for both neutron and hyperon stars .",
    "we have a large radii for a smaller stellar mass of @xmath143 in both cases . at this value of mass and radius ,",
    "the tidal deformability @xmath59 becomes maximum , because for a large radius with smaller mass , the force of attraction within the star is weak and when another star comes closure , the gravitational pull over ride maximum at the surface part of the star .",
    "this phenomena is true for both neutron as well as hyperon stars @xcite .",
    "then , suddenly the tidal deformibility decreases and again increases as shown in the figure making a broad peak at around m=0.7@xmath1420.8@xmath82 and then decrease smoothly with increase the mass of the star .",
    "since , the tidal deformibility depends a lot on both mass and radius of a neutron star , it is imperative to measure the radius of the star precisely , as the mass is already measured with very good precession .",
    "recently , steiner et.al . , predicted the most extreme limit for the tidal deformabilities between 0.6 and 6 @xmath40 10@xmath144 g @xmath140 s@xmath141 for 1.4@xmath82 with 95@xmath44 confidence .",
    "this range can be constraint on high dense matter of any measurements @xcite .",
    "mostly , the binaries masses are about 1.4@xmath82 , so in particular we are interested to study the phenomena within this mass range and the results are summarize in table [ tab2 ] . comparing the results , we notice that the tidal deformability @xmath59 is quite sensitive to the eos .",
    "it is more for stiffer eos , because of the high - density behavior of the symmetry energy @xcite .    finally , we calculate the weighted tidal deformability of the binary neutron star of mass @xmath145 and @xmath146 and is approximate is @xcite : @xmath147 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the root mean square ( rms ) measurement uncertainty @xmath117 can be calculated following approximate formula @xcite : @xmath148 where @xmath149 = 1.0 @xmath40 10@xmath150 g @xmath151 s@xmath152 is the tidal deformability for a single advanced ligo detector and @xmath153 ( @xmath154 ) cutoff frequency @xcite for the end stage of the inspiral binary neutron stars .",
    "d denotes the luminosity distance from the source to observer .    the weighted tidal deformibility for neutron and hyperon stars and their corresponding masses as cut - off frequency @xmath153 is shown in fig . [ fig9 ] .",
    "the cut - off frequency is a stopping criterion to estimate when the tidal model no longer describes the binary . here",
    ", we take the cut - off to be approximately when the two neutron stars come into contact , estimated as in eq.36 of ref .",
    "specifically , we use @xmath155 , where @xmath156 is the newtonian orbital frequency corresponding to the orbital separation where two unperturbed neutron stars with radii @xmath157 and @xmath158 would touch . in the upper panel fig .",
    "[ fig9](a , c ) , it shows the variation of mass of the binary as a function of cut - off frequency @xmath153 . here",
    ", we considered @xmath159 , i.e. , both the masses of the binary are equal .",
    "initially , the masses of the stars 0.2 @xmath82 remain almost constant upto @xmath160 hz .",
    "then the mass increases nearly exponentially upto a maximum mass of @xmath1611.75@xmath1422.81@xmath82 ( for ns ) and @xmath1611.33@xmath1422.25@xmath82 ( for hyperon star ) and then decreases . by this time",
    ", the cut - off frequency @xmath153 attains quite large value . when the individual mass of the binary is 1.4@xmath82 ,",
    "the nl3 set weighted tidal deformibility achieve the cut - off frequency @xmath162 hz is the minimum contrary to the @xmath163 hz of fsugold at the same mass of the single ns .",
    "it is also clear from the figure that the weighted tidal deformability of the ns for the four models are 7.466 , 3.668 , 5.229 and 2.418 for nl3 , g2 , fsugold2 and fsugold , respectively with the corresponding frequency 1256.7 , 1440.9 , 1332.4 and 1608.0 hz .",
    "using the cut - off frequency , we calculate the uncertainty in the measurement of the tidal deformability ( @xmath117 ) obtained from these four eoss for an equal - mass binary star inspiral at 100 mpc from aligo detector ( shaded region in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) .",
    "the uncertainty in the lower mass region ( 0.4@xmath1421.0@xmath82 ) of the ns @xmath117 is smaller .",
    "similar results are found in the case of hyperon star also .",
    "interestingly , the error ( @xmath117 ) increases with increase the mass of the binary for all the eoss . from table",
    "[ tab2 ] , by comparing the @xmath117 obtained from all the eoss , we find that predicted errors are greater than the measured value for a star of mass 1.4@xmath82 .",
    "in summary , four different models have been extensively applied which are obtained from effective field theory motivated relativistic mean field formalism .",
    "this effective interaction model satisfies the nuclear saturation properties and reproduce the bulk properties of finite nuclei with a very good accuracy .",
    "we used these four forces of interaction and calculate the equations of state for neutron and hyperon stars matter .",
    "it is noteworthy that each term of the interaction has its own meaning and has specific character .",
    "the inclusion of extra terms ( nucleons replaced by baryons octet ) in the lagrangian contribute to soften the eos and the matter becomes less compressible .",
    "hence , there is decrease in the maximum mass by @xmath164 than the pure neutron star .",
    "we have extended our calculations to various tidal responses both for electric - type ( even - parity ) and magnetic - type ( odd - parity ) of neutron and hyperon stars in the influence of an external gravitational tidal field .",
    "the love numbers are directly connected with surficial love number @xmath3 associated with the surface properties of the stars .",
    "subsequently , we study the quadrupolar tidal deformability @xmath59 of normal neutron star and hyperon star using different set of equations of state .",
    "these tidal deformabilities particularly depend on the quadrupole love number @xmath97 and radius ( @xmath78 ) of the isolated star .",
    "although the maximum value of @xmath97 is not very sensitive to the eos for neutron and hyperon stars lying in the range @xmath165 and @xmath166 for neutron and hyperon stars , respectively , but it is very much sensitive to the radius of the star .    we find that aligo can constraint on the existence of hyperon star , i.e. , the inner core of the ns has hyperons , but detecting them can be much harder .",
    "however , it should be able to constraint the neutron star deformability to @xmath16710 @xmath40 10@xmath144 g @xmath140 s@xmath141 for a binary of 1.4@xmath82 neutron stars at a distance 100 mpc from the detector .",
    "also , the present calculations suggest to use the portion of the signal with the gravitational wave frequency less than 400 hz . in future",
    ", we expect that aligo should be able to measure @xmath59 even for neutron stars masses up to 2.0@xmath82 and consequently constraint the stiffness of the equations of state .",
