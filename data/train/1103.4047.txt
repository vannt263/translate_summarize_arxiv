    "the recognition that damped ly@xmath2 absorption - line systems ( dlas ) seen in quasar spectra arise in neutral - gas - rich foreground galaxies ( wolfe et al .",
    "1986 ) motivated new methods for high - redshift galaxy studies @xmath13 years ago .",
    "these high hi column density systems , with @xmath14 atoms @xmath15 , trace the bulk of the observed neutral gas in the universe , and they are , therefore , powerful probes of galaxy formation and evolution back to the redshifts of the most distant quasars . larger datasets and deeper surveys ( e.g. prochaska , herbert - fort , & wolfe 2005 ; rao , turnshek , & nestor 2006 , henceforth , rtn06 ; noterdaeme et al .",
    "2009 ) have improved our knowledge of the neutral gas content and distribution at all observable redshifts , including the present epoch ( ryan - weber et al .",
    "2003 ; zwaan et al . 2005 ) .",
    "no other technique has revealed comparable reservoirs of neutral gas beyond the local universe . see rao ( 2005 ) and wolfe et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for some past reviews .",
    "few dlas were known at low redshift prior to the turn of the century because the ly@xmath2 line falls in the uv for @xmath16 .",
    "thus , in the absence of large uv spectroscopic surveys , this meant that studies of neutral gas in what corresponds to the most recent @xmath17% of the age of the universe ] were problematic .",
    "but now mgii - based uv spectroscopic surveys ( with hst - fos , hst - stis , hst - acs grism , and galex grism ) are identifying significant numbers of low - redshift dlas and subdlas ( rao & turnshek 2000 ; rtn06 ; monier et al .",
    "2009a ; turnshek et al . in prep ) .",
    "the -based surveys for dlas , which are designed to be unbiased ( rtn2006 ) , can be used to infer the incidence and cosmic neutral gas mass density at @xmath16 ( e.g. rtn06 ) .",
    "also , while subdla absorbers , those with @xmath18 atoms @xmath15 , do not contribute much to the cosmic neutral gas mass density ( proux et al . 2005 ) , they are often found to have higher metallicities than dlas ( kulkarni et al .",
    "2007 and references therein ) .",
    "lyman limit system ( lls ) absorbers are simply those with @xmath19 atoms @xmath15 . both subdlas and llss generally exhibit absorption , and all strong systems , those with @xmath1  , are lyman limit systems ( e.g. , churchill et al .",
    "however , unbiased -based surveys for subdlas and lls have never been implemented .    with the identification of dlas ( and subdlas and llss ) , follow - up work involving the study of their host galaxies , environments , neutral - gas - phase metallicities , kinematics , 21 cm spin temperatures ( when possible ) , ionization conditions , and numerical and semi - analytic modeling has kept many astronomers busy for decades . papers . ] despite this , a consensus on certain aspects of dlas is still lacking . our previous studies indicated that dla galaxies are of mixed morphology and that the highest @xmath20 systems have the smallest impact parameters , but are hosted by low luminosity ( @xmath21 ) galaxies ( rao et al .",
    "2003 ; turnshek et al .",

    "in addition , zwaan et al .",
    "( 2005 ) suggest that the local galaxy population can completely explain the properties of known low - redshift dla galaxies .",
    "studies of galaxies , of which dlas form a subset , have also revealed a mix of morphological types ( e.g. churchill , kacprzak , and steidel 2005 ; kacprzak et al .",
    "2007 ) , although most appear to be spirals and the majority exhibit minor perturbations ( as seen in hst images ) . from stacked images of over 2800 sdss quasar sightlines containing mgii absorption , zibetti et al .",

    "are known to be dlas ( rtn06 ) . however",
    ", the ultra - strong regime is not addressed in this paper .",
    "semi - analytic and numerical models , some of which are based on results from high - resolution spectroscopic data of dla metal absorption lines , have resulted in a variety of often competing scenarios for dlas : large rapidly rotating protogalactic disks ( prochaska & wolfe 1997 , 1998 ; wolfe & prochaska 1998 ) , merging protogalactic clumps in a hierarchical merging scenario ( haehnelt et al .",
    "1998 ) , low surface brightness galaxies ( jimenez et al .",
    "1999 ) , dwarf galaxies ( okoshi & nagashima 2005 ) , compact , faint galaxies with impact parameters smaller than 5 kpc at @xmath24 ( nagamine et al .",

    "; wolfe et al . 2003 ) .",
    "recent high - quality 21 cm data of local galaxies indicate that dla gas velocity widths are more consistent with tidal gas related to galaxy interactions or superwinds rather than galaxy disks ( zwaan et al .",
    "in addition , some recent compelling cosmological simulations relevant to interpreting the nature of -selected galaxies in general , and dla galaxies in particular , have been presented by kacprzak et al .",
    "( 2010 ) .",
    "however , there is a dearth of identified dla ( and subdla ) galaxies , and this has undoubtedly motivated the various interpretive scenarios . therefore , larger samples of neutral - gas - selected galaxies are required to investigate the possibilities , which in turn will help constrain models of galaxy evolution and better establish the galaxy population that harbors the bulk of the neutral gas in the universe .",
    "traditional galaxy surveys trace galaxies by virtue of their luminous emission . beyond the local universe",
    "far less is known about neutral - gas - selected galaxies and their relationship to luminosity - selected galaxies .    as an extension of our earlier work ( rao et al .",
    "2003 ) , we have undertaken a large multi - colour optical / ir imaging programme of quasar fields containing absorbers with measured @xmath20 .",
    "the absorbers were selected from table 1 of rtn06 , and were required to have absorption redshifts @xmath26 to optimize the possibilities for detection and characterization of galaxies in these fields . data and results from eight dlas in six quasar fields were presented in turnshek et al .",

    "this work demonstrates that the neutral hydrogen column density , @xmath20 , is strongly correlated with impact parameter , @xmath3 , in the sense that dla galaxies are systematically closer to the quasar sightline , by a factor of two , than are galaxies which give rise to subdlas and llss .",
    "we also find that the properties of low - redshift ( @xmath0 ) dlas and subdlas are very different in comparison to the properties of -rich galaxies at the present epoch",
    ". a significantly higher fraction of low - redshift absorbers have large @xmath3 , and a significantly higher fraction of the large @xmath3 galaxies have luminosities @xmath12 .",
    "all magnitudes reported in this paper are in the ab system , and all distance related quantities are calculated using the `` 737 '' cosmology with ( @xmath27 ) = ( 0.7,0.3,0.7 ) .",
    "the imaging data were obtained between december 1998 and june 2005 through community - access time at national facilities as well as through ohio state university s share of time at the mdm observatory . the various telescopes and detectors that were employed , as well as the varying observing conditions that prevailed over the better part of a decade of observations , resulted in an unavoidably inhomogeneous dataset .",
    "nevertheless , since most of the data are well calibrated and reach fainter magnitudes than large groundbased surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey , this observing programme has yielded the most useful and comprehensive set of images of dla , subdla , and lls absorption - line - producing galaxies that has thus far been obtained .",

    "the first column in figure [ stairplot ] shows the redshift distributions of the four primary properties of the sample of 80 galaxies : @xmath11 , @xmath6 , @xmath3 , and @xmath10 .",
    "table [ spearman ] shows that the strongest correlations , albeit less than @xmath35 , are between @xmath36 , and @xmath10 and @xmath3 .",
    "the luminosity - redshift correlation arises from the fact that the two faintest galaxies , those with @xmath37 , are among the lowest redshift identifications ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the two galaxies are the @xmath39 absorber towards 0254@xmath40334 with galaxy luminosity @xmath41 and the @xmath42 absorber towards 0952 + 179 with galaxy luminosity @xmath43 . a point of concern might be that these faint galaxies were detected only because of their low redshifts , and that similarly faint galaxies at higher redshifts , that are the true absorbers , are not being detected",
    ". however , figure [ lkvsz ] showed that the @xmath44 detection threshold is as faint as @xmath45 for galaxies ( assuming a size of 10 kpc ) in a few fields between redshifts 0.2 and 1 .",
    "while there is always the concern that imaging studies miss very faint galaxies , we do not believe that we are severely limited by this bias in comparison to other studies .",
    "in fact , our images go deeper than most other similar studies , and most of the galaxies fainter than @xmath46 have been identified in this study . to illustrate this , figure [ lvsz ]",
    "shows the luminosity distribution of galaxies with redshift .",
    "the black data points are from our groundbased data , and the red data points are galaxies identified in other studies . a ks test shows that the two distributions are similar , with @xmath47 .",
    "the @xmath3 versus @xmath36 panel in figure [ stairplot ] suggests that there is an upper envelope to the impact parameter distribution that is a function of redshift . at the lowest redshifts ( @xmath48 ) , there are no absorbing galaxies at @xmath49 kpc",
    "we do not believe that this is due to a bias , because we are unaware of low - redshift systems with unidentified absorbing galaxies .",
    "for example , such a bias may have arisen if large impact parameter galaxies were overlooked assuming that such galaxies could nt be the true absorbers .",
    "if this correlation is real , one speculation is that by @xmath50 , mergers have resulted in fewer clumps of gas at large distances from the centers of galaxies .",
    "also see section 4.10 .    of course",
    ", the trends here are weak : the spearman rank test results in only a @xmath51 correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath36 ( table [ spearman ] ) , and the ks test between @xmath36 samples split by median @xmath3 ( 30.7 kpc ) shows that the two distributions are similar ( @xmath52 , table [ bw_ks ] ) .",
    "table [ bw_ks ] also shows that the redshift distributions of samples split by @xmath6 or by @xmath11 are statistically similar .",
    "the most significant correlation , one that has previously been recognized ( rtn06 ) , is seen between @xmath11 and @xmath53 , with @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 ( table [ spearman ] ) , the @xmath11 versus @xmath6 correlation is significant at the 8.4@xmath7 level .",
    "for the 123 systems with @xmath57 , we find the relation to be significant at the 6.1@xmath7 level .",
    "the current imaging sample contains 80 systems with @xmath58 . ] .",
    "the column density clearly depends on @xmath11 , although the relation is not tight ( see figure [ stairplot ] , and figures 2 and 3 of rtn06 ) , i.e. , one can not predict the value of @xmath6 given @xmath11 . as discussed in rtn06 , the fraction of mgii systems that are dlas increases with @xmath11 , and there are no dlas with @xmath59  .",
    "since this imaging sample is largely derived from the rtn06 sample ( 72 of the 80 systems are from rtn06 ) , the same trend is seen here .",
    "it is clear from table [ bw_ks ] that the @xmath11 distributions of the dla , subdla , and lls samples are very significantly different .",
    "they differ at the 99.7% ( or @xmath44 ) confidence level for the dlas and subdlas , and at the 99.97% ( @xmath60 ) confidence level for the subdla and lls samples .",

    "( 2003 ) , whose templates were also used in this study .",
    "details of our photometric redshift fits are given in the appendix .",
    "budavari et al . (",
    "2003 ) used a spectral - type parameter that is essentially derived from the rest - frame colours of the best - fit spectral energy distribution ( sed ) . using this same classification",
    "we find that of the 27 galaxies with photometry for which we were able to fit templates , i.e. , those for which photometry in four or more filters exists , 4 have seds that are consistent with being ellipticals , 8 can be classified as spiral type sbc , 9 as scd , and 6 as irregular .",
    "of the 27 , eight are dla galaxies with template fits : one is an elliptical , two are of type sbc , four are scd , and one is an irregular galaxy .",
    "similarly , of the 11 subdla and 8 lls galaxies with template fits , the distribution is ( 2,2,5,2 ) and ( 1,4,0,3 ) , respectively , for types ( e , sbc , scd , irr ) .",
    "thus , as has been known from previous studies , we can now confirm with a larger sample that dla galaxies are predominantly late , star - forming galaxies , but span the entire range of galaxy spectral types .",
    "we also find the same result for subdla and lls galaxies .",
    "since sed fits were made for a random subset of galaxies in our sample , that depended mainly on observing parameters , we expect the same distribution of types for the remainder of the sample , i.e. , for galaxies with insufficient photometry to carry out template fits .",
    "moreover , we also showed that the cl = 1 sample , i.e. , the sample for which spectral - types could be determined , has the same properties as the cl = 2 or 3 sample (  4.2 ) .",
    "figure [ zn_nwbl ] shows plots of metallicity measurements , specifically [ zn / h ] , from the literature as a function of absorption line parameters @xmath11 and @xmath6 , and galaxy parameters @xmath3 and @xmath10 .",
    "even with this small sample , it can be seen that higher @xmath11 systems tend to have higher metallicities ( e.g. , nestor et al .",

    "2005 , kulkarni et al .",
    "the tendency for subdlas to have higher metallicities than dlas is also apparent ( e.g. , meiring et al .",
    "however , no trends with galaxy properties can be deduced from the two panels on the right in figure [ zn_nwbl ] .",
    "one might expect that more luminous , and therefore more massive , galaxies would tend to give rise to higher @xmath11 systems ( since rest equivalent width is an indicator of the velocity spread of the gas ) , but this is not seen in our sample ( see table [ spearman ] ) .",
    "one might also expect some of the more luminous galaxies to be more evolved , and thus exhibit higher metallicities , but this is also not seen in our sample .",
    "there also does not seem to be any correlation between metallicity and galaxy impact parameter .",
    "of course , the sample is small .",
    "more conclusive results must await more measurements of metallicities at @xmath58 .",

    "our data for @xmath113 are shown as crosses , with the size of the crosses indicating three different bins in luminosity .",
    "the smallest crosses are galaxies with @xmath114 , the medium sized crosses are those with @xmath115 , and the large crosses represent galaxies with @xmath116 .",
    "the subdlas and the dlas are separated by the vertical dashed line .",

    "they represent the conditional probability of impact parameter as a function of column density for local galaxies . using 21-cm line maps of nearby galaxies taken with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope , they present absorber and galaxy properties in a form that can be used to compare with the properties of higher redshift absorbers .",
    "specifically , from their analysis of essentially @xmath118 galaxies , they derive relevant probabilities within this @xmath119 plane .",
    "the line labeled `` median '' indicates that there is a 50% probability that the absorber galaxy will lie below this line .",
    "the other lines show the 10th , 25th , 75th , 90th , and 99th percentiles for galaxies at @xmath120 .",
    "based on the low - redshift dla galaxy data available at that time , they concluded that the distributions were similar , although there were somewhat fewer low @xmath3 systems than expected .",
    "now , with our much larger sample we see that the distributions are markedly different . for @xmath121 ,",
    "only eight out of 42 galaxies lie below the median line , and we have no galaxies below the 25th percentile line . as we had discussed in  3 , we might have misidentified about four galaxies in our sample due to our inability to probe close to the quasar sightline .",
    "therefore , at most , we would have 4/42 , or 9.5% of the sample below the 25th percentile line and 12/42 ( 28.6% ) below the median line . at the high end of the @xmath3 distribution",
    ", we see that 11/42 ( 26% ) of the galaxies are beyond the 99th percentile line .",
    "if four of these were the misidentifications 7/42 ( 17% ) would be above this line .",
    "zwaan et al .",
    "( 2005 ) also find that at @xmath122 the most luminous galaxies are most likely to be associated with high @xmath20 dlas at large impact parameters .",
    "the red dotted line in figure [ zwaan ] has been adapted from their figure 18 , and indicates that above this line , more than 50% of the galaxies are more luminous than @xmath9 at @xmath112 .",
    "we find that out of the 24 galaxies in our sample that have @xmath123 and are above this line , only two are more luminous than @xmath9 .    clearly , the properties of low - redshift dla and subdla galaxies differ considerably in comparison to the local population , and this might be indicative of evolution in the neutral - gas environments of galaxies . although the statistics at the low redshift end of our sample are small , we find that the impact parameter distribution ( figure [ stairplot ] and section 4.3 ) has an upper envelope that declines between redshifts @xmath124 and @xmath125 . taken in combination with the zwaan et al .",
    "results , this is perhaps suggestive of the process of galaxy assembly over the last 5 gyr .",
    "the factor of two decline in @xmath126 over the same redshift interval ( rtn06 ) might also be related to the same phenomenon .      here",
    "we address the question of whether the galaxies identified in hst data have different properties in comparison to galaxies identified in groundbased data .",
    "for example , since hst images can probe closer in to the quasar sightline , the impact parameters of galaxies identified in hst images might be systematically smaller .",
    "of the 29 galaxies that were known prior to this work ( table [ idprevious ] ) , 17 have been identified in hst images and 12 were first identified in groundbased studies .",
    "the 1127@xmath40145 absorber was first identified by bergeron & boiss ( 1991 ) in groundbased data .",
    "an hst image of this field was later discussed by kacprzak et al .",
    "in addition , the 0827 + 243 field which was in our initial groundbased sample ( rao et al .",
    "2003 ) , was imaged with hst , but the absorber identification remained the same ( steidel et al .",
    "for the purpose of the comparison being made here , these two fields will be considered hst fields .",
    "a ks test gives a probability of @xmath127 that the groundbased and hst impact parameter samples are drawn from the same parent population . while it may appear that the hst - identified galaxies have smaller impact parameters ( the median @xmath3 value for the hst identifications is 21.4 kpc versus 31.3 kpc for the groundbased identifications ) , the distributions of hst and groundbased identifications are statistically similar .",
    "their luminosity distributions are also similar with @xmath128 .",
    "we have presented the results of an optical / ir imaging programme aimed at studying the properties of @xmath0 galaxies giving rise to quasar absorption systems with available neutral hydrogen column densities .",
    "results from 55 quasar fields with 66 absorbers are presented here for the first time .",
    "we were able to identify the absorbing galaxy for 54 of these . by combining galaxy identifications from previous studies",
    ", we have analysed the properties of a sample of 27 dla ( @xmath14 atoms @xmath15 ) , 30 subdla ( @xmath129 atoms @xmath15 ) , and 23 lls ( with @xmath20 not large enough to be dlas or subdlas  @xmath130 atoms @xmath15 ) galaxies .",
    "all of these absorbers were -selected .",
    "while our sampling of @xmath11 values is sufficient to include all dlas , it is unlikely that this holds for subdlas and llss .",
    "but we have no _ a priori _ reason to believe that this significantly affects our results .    here",
    "we summarize the main results from  3 and  4 .    *",
    "an analysis of our uniform @xmath131-band dataset shows that the surface density of galaxies falls off exponentially with increasing impact parameter , @xmath3 , from the quasar sightline relative to a constant background of galaxies , with an _ e_-folding length of @xmath4 kpc ( figure 6 ) .",
    "galaxies with @xmath5 kpc calculated at the absorption redshift are statistically consistent with being unrelated to the absorption system , and are either background or foreground galaxies .",
    "see  3 and conclusion 4 ( below ) . *",
    "the correlation between the log of the neutral hydrogen column density , @xmath6 , and rest equivalent width , @xmath11 , first reported by rtn06 but subject to the noted caveats , is also present in this imaging sample (  4.4 and figure 21 ) .",
    "since most of the sample was selected from rtn06 , a correlation is expected .",
    "the @xmath6 and @xmath11 parameters are positively correlated at the @xmath132 level of significance ( see footnote # 8) .",
    "the median values of @xmath11 in the imaging sample are 2.0   for the dlas , 1.37   for the subdlas , and 0.78   for the llss . *",
    "the galaxy luminosity relative to @xmath9 , @xmath10 , is not correlated with @xmath11 , and the @xmath3 value is only weakly correlated with @xmath11 (  4.4 ) .",
    "there is an inverse correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath11 at only the 1.8@xmath7 level of significance ( figure 19 ) .",
    "also , galaxies which give rise to higher @xmath11 are not significantly systematically more luminous , even if the comparison is made as a function of @xmath3 ( figure 22 ) .",
    "* the @xmath6 value is inversely correlated with @xmath3 at the 3.0@xmath7 level of significance in the sense that dla galaxies are found systematically closer to the quasar sightline , by a factor of two , than are galaxies which give rise to subdlas or llss (  4.5 and figure 24 ) .",
    "the median impact parameter is 17.4 kpc for the dla galaxy sample , 33.3 kpc for the subdla sample , and 36.4 kpc for the lls sample .",
    "this is not unexpected , since higher column density gas tends to exist at smaller galactic radii , but this is the first time it has been definitively demonstrated among galaxies identified as dla or subdla absorbers .",
    "we also find that the decline in the median value of @xmath6 with @xmath3 can be roughly described by an exponential with an _ e_-folding length of 12 kpc that occurs at @xmath8 ( figure 25 ) .",
    "* @xmath6 is not correlated with galaxy luminosity (  4.5 and figure 26 ) .",
    "the median values of luminosity are @xmath133 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 for the dla , subdla , and lls samples , respectively . there is also no evidence that , within each sample , galaxies with large impact parameters are more luminous ( figure 26 ) . *",
    "the @xmath3 value is not significantly correlated with @xmath10 , as a positive correlation is present at only a 1.2@xmath7 level of significance (  4.6 and figure 19 ) .",
    "* a pca did not reveal any useful information , i.e. , the absorbers do not occupy a preferred direction in the multiparameter space defined by @xmath11 , @xmath6 , @xmath3 , and @xmath10 (  4.7 ) . *",
    "dla , subdla , and lls galaxies comprise a mix of spectral types , but are inferred to be predominantly late type galaxies based on their spectral energy distributions (  4.8 ) . * using measurements of metallicity from the literature , we find no trends between metallicity and @xmath3 or @xmath10 (  4.9 and figure 27 ) .",
    "this is somewhat surprising , but we caution that the samples are small . * we find that the properties of low - redshift dlas and subdlas are very different in comparison to the properties of gas - rich galaxies at the present epoch (  4.10 and figure 28 ) . a significantly higher fraction of low - redshift absorbers have large @xmath3 values , and a significantly higher fraction of the large @xmath3 value galaxies have luminosities @xmath12 .",
    "we have presented results from a -based quasar absorption line search for galaxies that give rise to dla , subdla , and lls absorption at redshifts @xmath0 in the spectra of background quasars .",
    "the sample we studied was formed from a larger sample of strong absorbers ( @xmath1  ) whose column densities were determined by measuring the ly@xmath2 line in hst uv spectra .",
    "analysis of our data revealed two main correlations .",
    "first , by considering the three different @xmath20 column density regimes ( i.e. , dlas , subdlas , and llss ) , we find that @xmath6 is positively correlated with @xmath11 at the 4.7@xmath7 significance level ( i.e. ,  5 conclusion 2 and figure 21 ) .",
    "it is important to realize that because the absorption lines are generally saturated , @xmath11 is a proxy for the sightline velocity spread of the absorbing gas associated with the galaxy .",
    "therefore , one can statistically infer that sightlines that intercept larger columns of gas generally encounter larger gas velocity spreads .",
    "however , this is not a tight correlation .",
    "the @xmath20 value can not be used to predict @xmath11 , nor can @xmath11 be used to predict @xmath20 .",
    "one interpretation is that the gas that is primarily responsible for a dla is one of many clouds along the line of sight .",
    "the larger the rest equivalent width , the more clouds along the sightline , and the higher the probability of one of them being the cloud that produces a dla .",
    "this explains why , for example , a strong system is not always a dla , and why weaker systems can occassionally be dlas .",
    "the threshold @xmath134  , below which no dlas are found , is then representative of the minimum velocity spread of a region containing dla clouds .",
    "second , we found that the median impact parameter of a sample of dla galaxies is approximately half that found for samples of subdla and lls galaxies ( i.e. ,  5 conclusion 4 and figure 24 ) .",
    "subdla and lls galaxies have similar impact parameter distributions .",
    "this second correlation has a 3.0@xmath7 level of significance .",
    "again , this is not a tight correlation . to emphasize this",
    ", we note that three of our dla galaxy identifications have impact parameters @xmath135 kpc , while six of our subdla and lls galaxy identifications have @xmath136 kpc .",
    "it does , however , seem unreasonable to expect a tight correlation for either of these two main correlations .",
    "this is because the observed impact parameter is set by the chance separation between the absorbing galaxy and the quasar sightline .",
    "that is , the observed impact parameter for an absorbing galaxy only indicates that the radial extent of the gas surrounding the galaxy extends at least as far out as the impact parameter ( see discussion of equation 1 , below ) .",
    "the median impact parameter for dla galaxies is @xmath137 kpc , whereas it is @xmath138 kpc for subdla and lls galaxies .",
    "but there is wide overlap in the distributions of impact parameters among the three identified galaxy samples , as expected . in combination",
    "these two findings suggest that systems with lower @xmath3 values should generally have larger @xmath11 values and vice versa , and indeed a weak inverse correlation at a 1.8@xmath7 level of significance is seen ( i.e. ,  5 conclusion 3 and figure 19 ) .    taken together , the observed trends , although weak , indicate that dlas generally have higher values of @xmath11 , smaller impact parameters , lower metallicities , and similar luminosities in comparison to subdlas .",
    "that subdla and dla galaxies have similar luminosities implies that the subdlas are not more massive , which was a suggestion made by kulkarni et al .",
    "( 2010 ) to explain their higher metallicities .",
    "the mass - metallicity relation does not appear to play a role here .",
    "that dla sightlines have higher velocity spreads but lower impact parameters is an indication that the gas is not rotationally supported .",
    "as suggested by several studies , superwinds and tidal gas from mergers are likely to be involved ( see below )",
    ".    the absence of tight correlations may also be due to the patchiness of absorbing gas and misidentifications of `` true '' absorbing galaxies .",
    "for example , with regard to the gas being patchy , monier et al . ( 2009b ) found that @xmath20 changed from the dla to the subdla regime over sightline changes as small as @xmath139 kpc at @xmath140 .",
    "cooke et al .",
    "( 2010 ) studied a @xmath141 dla with @xmath142 atoms @xmath15 , but along an adjacent sightline separated by 2.7 kpc found that the column density dropped to @xmath143 atoms @xmath15 .",
    "this suggests that a slight change in sightline separation , which is much smaller than the observed @xmath3 value , influences classification of the absorbing galaxy as a dla , subdla , or lls galaxy .",
    "this would clearly increase the intrinsic spread in correlations with @xmath20 . since we did not form a control sample of galaxies that _ do not _ give rise to absorption lines in the spectra of background quasars",
    ", our current work offers no conclusions on the covering factor of @xmath1   absorbers .",
    "however , we note that with their absorbing and non - absorbing galaxy samples , kacprzak et al .",
    "( 2008 ) obtain a mean covering factor of @xmath144% for @xmath1   gas .",
    "chen et al . ( 2010 ) derive a covering factor of @xmath17% for @xmath1   absorbers and @xmath145% for @xmath146 absorbers .",
    "even though information on column density is unavailable in these other analyses , these results also provide evidence for patchiness which would increase the intrinsic spread in correlations .    with regard to the possible misidentification of absorbing galaxies , consider our identifications for two dla absorbing galaxies (  3 ) with impact parameters of @xmath147 kpc ( for a 0.7@xmath9 galaxy ) and @xmath148 kpc ( for a 0.05@xmath9 galaxy ) .",
    "these may both be outliers , but certainly the identification of the second one seems far - fetched .",
    "however , there is another possibility which may put such identifications in context .",
    "recently , kacprzak et al . (",
    "2010 ) published cosmological simulations to aide in the interpretation of their observations of -absorption - selected galaxies at intermediate redshift .",
    "their simulations indicate that , relative to a central galaxy , absorption selects metal - enriched halo gas , tidal streams , filaments , and small satellite galaxies .",
    "in particular , they find that column densities in the dla regime can arise in low - mass satellite galaxies at impact parameters as large at @xmath149 kpc .",
    "our large impact parameter dla galaxies may be examples of such cases , and in that sense they may be misidentifications since the small satellite galaxies would not be identified because of the glare of the background quasar .",
    "it is therefore useful to use our results to consider the overall radial gaseous extent of our identified absorbing galaxies as a function of galaxy of luminosity @xmath98 , i.e. , @xmath150 .",
    "however , it seems appropriate to interpret results on @xmath150 in the context of the kacprzak et al .",
    "( 2010 ) simulations in which `` halo '' gas can have a variety of origins , including the possibility that the observed absorption arises in a neutral - gas - rich satellite galaxy which resides in the environment of the galaxy we identify as the absorbing galaxy .",
    "another result worth mentioning is the @xmath151 , @xmath152 , subdla system towards pg 1216 + 019 ( tripp et al .",
    "2005 ) , which is an example of an absorbing galaxy that was detected in emission alone .",
    "briggs & barnes ( 2006 ) report on the detection of a 21 cm line emitter that has @xmath153 between 5 and 15 @xmath154 , and is within @xmath155 kpc of the quasar sightline .",
    "no optical counterpart to this emitter has been detected thus far ( chen et al .",
    "tripp et al . 2005 ) , implying that any optical emission from this galaxy might be hidden under the glare of either the quasar psf or that of a nearby ( 10  away ) star .",
    "other emitting objects within 100 km s@xmath156 of the absorption redshift are a @xmath157 galaxy at a distance of 92 kpc from the quasar sightline and an optically - undetected , @xmath158 , object 120 kpc from the quasar sightline .",
    "this suggests that the absorber is likely to be tidal debris or diffuse gas in the halo of one or both of the two more massive galaxies ( briggs & barnes 2006 ) .",
    "thus , here is a case where the @xmath159 kpc galaxy would have been identified as the absorber in the absence of the 21 cm data , when in fact , a much smaller @xmath3 , low - mass dwarf galaxy is the true site of absorption .",
    "past attempts have been made to derive a radius - luminosity scaling relationship for absorbers in order to infer the extent of gaseous halos ( e.g. , steidel 1995 , guillemin & bergeron 1997 , kacprzak et al . 2008 , chen et al . 2010 ) .",
    "the scaling relation is a power law of the form @xmath160 where @xmath161 denotes the radial gaseous extent of a galaxy of luminosity @xmath98 . for our data",
    "this is illustrated by the upper envelope of a plot of @xmath3 versus @xmath10 . in the left panel of figure [ blpowerlaw ]",
    "we plot @xmath3 versus @xmath69 for galaxies in our sample with @xmath131-band data . in the right panel",
    "we plot this for our entire sample using a compilation of measurements in several wavebands ( see tables [ idprevious ] and [ idsummary ] ) .",
    "we show the @xmath131-band data separately because measurements in the literature generally use a single waveband , however a comparison between the left and right panels shows that the two distributions of data points are similar , and that the conclusions do not change when we include our entire sample .",
    "the two solid curves in the two panels are power laws of the form shown in equation [ equationrl ] , and encompass the range of possible upper envelopes to the data points .",
    "the shallower power law has @xmath162 kpc and @xmath163 , and the steeper power law has @xmath164 kpc and @xmath165 .",
    "both power laws do not include the outlier at @xmath148 kpc and @xmath166 .",
    "this is the galaxy that is identified as the @xmath167 dla absorber towards 1622 + 239 ( kacprzak et al .",
    "it is also inconsistent with the other models from the literature , and is therefore , almost certainly a misidentification .",
    "the two data points at @xmath168 kpc and @xmath169 are identifications with confidence levels cl @xmath170 , where the identifications were not straightforward .",
    "it could well be that these galaxies were misidentified .",
    "on the other hand , of the two llss with impact parameters @xmath171 kpc , one is a spectroscopic identification , while the other has cl @xmath172 .",
    "therefore , the steeper power law , i.e. , the solid curve with @xmath173 , may be a more adequate representation of the upper envelope of gaseous halos of strong absorbers , although the shallower power law can not be ruled out because of the small number of galaxies that define the upper envelope . in any case",
    ", these data indicate that the characteristic size of the gaseous halo ( environment ) of an @xmath9 galaxy is likely to be as large as 120 kpc , larger than any of the previously derived values .    the k08 ( kacprzak et al . 2008 ) and c10 ( chen et al . 2010 ) models shown in figure [ blpowerlaw ] are roughly consistent with the data , although the c10 model excludes more data points .",
    "the s95 ( steidel et al . 1995 ) and gb97 ( guillemin and bergeron 1997 ) models are clearly ruled out by our data .",
    "it is now clear from the more recent studies that gas extends much farther out from the centers of galaxies than previously thought .",
    "for example , the conclusion from initial studies that there is always a bright , @xmath9 , galaxy associated with strong absorbers , and that the galaxies have gaseous disks that are @xmath174 kpc in radius , is no longer supported .",
    "only nine out of 80 galaxies in our sample are @xmath175 or brighter .",
