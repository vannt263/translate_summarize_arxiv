    "x - ray , optical and radio emission following gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are in broad agreement with models based on relativistic blast waves at cosmological distances ( @xcite ) . in these models ,",

    "what follows , we refer to the surrounding gas as interstellar medium ( ism ) gas , although the gas need not necessarily be inter - stellar . the expanding shock continuously heats fresh gas and accelerates relativistic electrons , which produce the observed afterglow radiation through synchrotron emission ( @xcite ) .    to match the observations , the magnetic field behind the shock has to be @xmath0 of equipartition with the shock - heated , compressed ism",
    "what is the origin of this field ?",
    "the shock - compressed ism field is many orders of magnitude smaller than needed .",
    "the magnetic field frozen into the initial grb fireball loses strength by the time the afterglow stage begins , and it is in a wrong place anyway . during the afterglow , the decompressed grb field is located far behind the shock , while most of the energy is in the recently shocked ism .",
    "therefore , the magnetic field most likely must be generated in and by the blast wave .",
    "if the coherence length of the generated field is comparable to the thickness of the blast wave , the radiation will be polarized . an @xmath0 degree of polarization is expected .",
    "this is significantly smaller than the maximal synchrotron polarization , @xmath3 , because the emitting region is thin and broad ; it must be covered by @xmath4 mutually incoherent patches of magnetic field .    in a paper on microlensing of grb afterglows , loeb & perna ( 1998 )",
    "have mentioned the possibility that the afterglows are polarized . here",

    ", the unshocked ism may be taken to be cold unmagnetized hydrogen . to calculate the synchrotron emission we need to know the fraction of energy in magnetic fields @xmath7 , and in electrons @xmath8 , and the shape of the electron distribution function ( a function @xmath9 with first two moments equal to 1 ) .",
    "we include @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 in the list of independent parameters . in principle , these are determined by the blast wave energy and the ism density , but a theory of strong collisionless shocks is not available ( sagdeev 1966 , krall 1997 ) .    the plasma flow in the shocked ism is assumed to be described by the blandford - mckee ( @xcite ) self - similar solution .",
    "the lorentz factor of the shock wave @xmath10 , the lorentz factor of the flow @xmath11 , the proper energy density @xmath12 , and the proper number density @xmath13 for all space - time points in the shocked plasma are given in appendix a.    we assume that magnetic fields and electrons are described by simple scalings .",
    "the magnetic field is @xmath14 , and @xmath7 is the same in all space - time points .",
    "the electron distribution function in the local rest frame has the same shape in all space - time points on the shock front , after the shock passage it evolves by adiabatic and synchrotron cooling . at the shock front ,",

    "the synchrotron power per unit frequency per electron emitted in the local rest frame is @xmath17 @xmath18 but @xmath16 _ is not _ the standard dimensionless synchrotron emission function given in rybicki & lightman ( 1979 ) .",
    "@xmath16 depends on the shape of the electron distribution function ( b7 ) .",
    "given the set of blast wave parameters , we will measure time , frequency , and spectral luminosity ( energy per time per frequency ) in units of @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 the formal origin of these units is explained in appendices a , b. their physical meaning is illustrated by the following order of magnitude statement . at observed time",
    "@xmath22 , the blast wave slows down to lorentz factor 2 ; it radiates at frequency @xmath23 , with spectral luminosity @xmath24 .",
    "our analysis is restricted to the ultrarelativistic stage , that is to dimensionless observed times @xmath25 .",
    "we first calculate in  3.1 synchrotron emission of the blast wave neglecting radiative cooling of electrons , i.e. assuming that the shape @xmath9 is the same in the entire shocked plasma . in  3.2 we relax this assumption : @xmath9 is determined at the shock front and evolves by synchrotron and adiabatic cooling thereafter .",
    "our analytic lightcurves are exact under the following assumptions : ( i ) the blast - wave hydrodynamics is described by the blandford - mckee self - similar solution ( @xcite ) ; ( ii ) the magnetic field energy density is a fixed fraction of the total energy density , independent of space and time ; ( iii ) the electron distribution function is determined at the shock front and evolves afterwards only through adiabatic and synchrotron cooling . @xcite",
    "numerically derived exact lightcurves for power - law electron distribution , under the assumptions described above and neglecting electron cooling .",
    "it should be emphasized that since a theory of strong collisionless shocks is not available at present , none of the above assumptions can be justified .",
    "thus , the numerical values ( e.g. of the peak flux and peak frequency as function of time ) derived here under these assumptions are not necessarily more accurate than those obtained by order of magnitude estimates ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the exact analytic lightcurves are useful because they allow us to determine which afterglow characteristics are strongly dependent on the details of the electron distribution function , and which are insensitive to these details and depend mainly on the global blast wave parameters ( i.e the blast wave energy , the ambient medium density , and the energy fractions carried by electrons and magnetic fields ) .      in appendix b",

    "the flux below the peak is also robust , and for @xmath52 it is given by @xmath53    the peak frequency @xmath54 is model - dependent , and may differ by an order of magnitude between different electron distribution functions with similar @xmath55 . the spectral shape ( equivalently the time profile ) above the peak is also strongly dependent on the details of the electron distribution function .",
    "synchrotron radiation is highly polarized ( ginzburg 1989 ) , but for this polarization to be measurable in an unresolved source , the magnetic field coherence length should be comparable to the source size . here",
    "we show that grb afterglows might be polarized .",
    "an @xmath56 polarization seems to be an upper bound , corresponding to a coherence length that grows at about the speed of light after the field is generated at the shock front .",
    "qualitatively , our polarization analysis can be summarized as follows .",

    "as far as we know , magnetic field generation in collisionless shocks is not understood .",
    "it seems possible that , at the shock front , weibel instability generates near equipartition ( @xmath66 ) small scale ( @xmath67 skin depth @xmath68 , here @xmath69 , @xmath70 ) magnetic fields . by magnetic moment",
    "conservation , electrons are accelerated to near equipartition energies (  relativistic version of sagdeev 1966 , kazimura et .",

    "the ultimate fate of the field many skin depth behind the shock front is not clear .",
    "what happens to the magnetic field coherence length @xmath71 , and to the magnitude @xmath72 at a distance @xmath73 behind the shock front ?",
    "three scenarios seem to make sense :    1 .",
    "the generated field dies out after finishing its job of isotropizing the plasma and bringing it to a state given by the shock jump conditions .",
    "2 .   the magnitude stays at about equipartition , the coherence length stays at about the skin depth .",
    "the magnitude stays at about equipartition , the coherence length grows as @xmath74 .",
    "scenario 1 is not consistent with the synchrotron emission model for the afterglow , because too little synchrotron radiation is produced by a skin - deep shell with strong magnetic fields .",
    "scenario 2 means unpolarized radiation .",
    "we will evaluate the degree of polarization for scenario 3 .",
    "assume that two events in the shocked ism belong to the same coherent patch if the difference in their proper times elapsed after the shock passage @xmath75 , and their spatial separation transverse to the line of site @xmath76 are small : @xmath77 @xmath78 @xmath79 , @xmath58 is the averaged proper time since the shock . by the proper time of an event in the shocked ism we mean the proper time after the shock of a fluid particle at this event .      as shown in appendix d , for the emission event with observed time @xmath26 ,",

    "this gives , approximately , the degree of polarization . by numerical simulations ( appendix e ) , @xmath87",
    "we have derived simple , exact analytic afterglow lightcurves for an arbitrary electron distribution function , including the effects of electron synchrotron cooling , eq . ( 7 ) , and in the limit where synchrotron cooling is negligible , eq .",

    "fig . 1 , 2 , 3 , that the peak synchrotron flux , eq .",
    "( 11 ) , and the synchrotron flux at frequencies well below the peak flux , eq .",
    "( 12 ) , are insensitive to the details of the electron distribution function . since the peak flux is also insensitive to the details of the blast wave hydrodynamic profiles ( fig . 1 in @xcite )",
    ", the peak flux and the flux at frequencies well below the peak depend mainly on the global blast wave parameters : blast wave energy , ambient medium density , magnetic field and electron energy fractions [ cf . eqs .",
    "( 11,12 ) ] .",

    "the numerical value of the peak flux derived here , eq . ( 11 ) , is similar to that derived in @xcite , within a factor @xmath88 of the values given in @xcite and @xcite , and a factor @xmath89 smaller than given in @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy with @xcite is mainly due to the fact that it is assumed by these authors that the spectral width of the observed spectrum at fixed time is determined mainly by the intrinsic spectral width of synchrotron emission , while the actual width is significantly larger and dominated by contribution to the observed spectrum at given time from different space - time points with different plasma conditions .",
    "the peak frequency and spectral shape at frequencies above the peak are strongly dependent on details of the electron distribution function , see figs . 1 , 2 , 3 .",
    "furthermore , the peak frequency is also strongly dependent on the details of the blast wave hydrodynamic profiles ( fig . 1 in @xcite ) .",
    "this , and the fact that the spectral peak is flat , imply that observational determination of the peak frequency and of spectral features above the peak at a given time can not be used directly to constrain global blast wave parameters .",
    "these features would mostly provide information on the electron distribution function .",
    "the numeric value of the peak frequency derived here , eq .",
    "( 10 ) , is within a factor @xmath88 of the values given in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , and a factor @xmath89 smaller than given in @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy with @xcite is due mainly to the fact that it is assumed in @xcite that the spectral peak is close to the synchrotron frequency of electrons with average lorentz factor , while the actual peak is closer to the synchrotron frequency of electrons near the peak of the electron distribution function .    the break frequency ( the frequency where the high - frequency spectrum changes the slope from @xmath90 to @xmath91 due to synchrotron cooling ) is not prominent .",
    "the transition to the @xmath91 slope occurs in a manner that strongly depends on the details of the electron distribution function .",
    "if the observed afterglows are indeed synchrotron emission from ultrarelativistic blast waves propagating into ism , the magnetic field needed to account for the emission must be generated by the blast wave .",
    "if the coherence length of the generated field grows at about the speed of light after the field was generated at the shock front , afterglows should be noticeably polarized .",
