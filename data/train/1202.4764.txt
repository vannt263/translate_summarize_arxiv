    "<S> remarkably , the results for few - body observables obtained with the reduced , diagonal , and canonical density matrices are very similar to each other , no matter which fraction of the lattice is traced out . </S>",
    "<S> hence , for all physical quantities studied here , the results in the diagonal ensemble match the thermal predictions .    despite advances , </S>",
    "<S> the emergence of thermodynamics from quantum mechanics is still a subject under debate . </S>",
    "<S> how to derive , from first principles , proper ensembles leading to the basic thermodynamic relations is not yet entirely clear . </S>",
    "<S> according to the concept of canonical typicality  @xcite , the reduced density matrix of a subsystem of most pure states of many - particle systems is canonical . </S>",
    "<S> the proof of this statement requires a partition of the original system into a small `` system '' and a large `` environment '' . </S>",
    "<S> however , suppose , for example , that our universe is in a pure state and that we trace out only a finite number of degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> can we describe the rest of the universe using statistical mechanics ? </S>",
    "<S> how much one needs to trace out , how well the notion of canonical typicality works in finite systems , and which quantities will be more or less affected by the fraction of the original system traced out are questions that have received little attention . </S>",
    "<S> they are the more pressing given the progress made in experiments with ultracold gases  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we can discuss these issues in the context of entropy . </S>",
    "<S> if one takes an eigenstate of a generic many - body hamiltonian and traces out the `` environment '' ( @xmath0 ) , the grand canonical ( gc ) ensemble is the appropriate ensemble to describe the system ( @xmath1 ) that is left , where the total energy and number of particles fluctuate . </S>",
    "<S> one immediately realizes that the gc - entropy , @xmath2 , must be different from the von neumann entropy , @xmath3 , if only a small fraction of the original system is traced out . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath3 is extensive in the size of the environment , instead of in the size of the system as @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this follows from the fact that , for a composite system @xmath4 in a pure state @xmath5 , the reduced von neumann entropy is defined as @xmath6             \\equiv -\\mbox{tr}_{\\cal e}\\left [ \\hat{\\rho}_{\\cal e } \\ln\\hat{\\rho}_{\\cal e } \\right ] , \\label{svn}\\ ] ] where the boltzmann constant is set to unity and the reduced density matrix @xmath7 and similarly @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 has been widely used to measure the entanglement in bipartite systems  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if the pure state is separable , @xmath9 , then @xmath10 , while maximum entanglement leads to @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the smallest dimension of the two subsystems . </S>",
    "<S> the source of the disparity between @xmath3 and @xmath2 is the information present in the off - diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix , which is not contained in the thermodynamic ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> when a large fraction of the original system is traced out , the equivalence between @xmath3 and @xmath2 is expected ( canonical typicality ) . however , </S>",
    "<S> up to our knowledge , it has not been demonstrated for realistic systems .    </S>",
    "<S> now suppose that instead of tracing out the environment , we physically cut it off and let the remaining system relax to equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> we can then ask how much one needs to cut for the entropy of the reduced system to become equivalent to @xmath2 ( if ever ) . after relaxation , this system is described by the diagonal ensemble  @xcite obtained by writing the reduced density matrix ( @xmath13 ) in the energy eigenbasis . </S>",
    "<S> the proper thermodynamic entropy in this case has been argued to be the diagonal entropy @xcite , defined as @xmath14 where @xmath15 are the diagonal elements of the density matrix . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath16 counts logarithmically the number of energy eigenstates which are occupied in @xmath1 . unlike @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath16 is extensive in the system size even if we trace a very small environment , e.g. , a single degree of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> cutting off the environment is equivalent to a sudden quench ; it introduces to the system the ( nonextensive ) energy uncertainty @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> this uncertainty implies that if all the eigenstates of the subsystem hamiltonian @xmath18 within the window @xmath19 are occupied with roughly the same weights @xcite , then @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the density of states in @xmath1 . up to subextensive corrections , @xmath16 would then coincide with the thermodynamic entropy of @xmath1 .    in this letter , we study the properties of mixed states obtained from eigenstates of a many - body lattice hamiltonian after tracing out or cutting off an increasingly large environment . </S>",
    "<S> one of our goals is to understand the structure of the remaining reduced density matrix and if it ever becomes thermal , which we monitor using @xmath3 , @xmath2 , and @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , for nonintegrable systems , @xmath16 approaches @xmath2 after cutting off a few ( possibly one ) sites , i.e. , our hypothesis above is verified . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 , on the other hand , remains different from @xmath16 and @xmath2 until a large fraction of the lattice is traced out @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this motivates us to distinguish between the conventional ( or strong ) typicality @xmath22 and a weaker typicality in the sense that @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> the latter implies that _ only _ the diagonal part of the density matrix of the reduced system in the energy eigenbasis exhibits a thermal structure .    </S>",
    "<S> our results then show that the diagonal entropy satisfies the key thermodynamic relation : @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the energies of the subsystems . </S>",
    "<S> this follows from the fact that @xmath16 coincides with the thermodynamic entropy for @xmath1 and @xmath0 simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , @xmath3 can not satisfy this equality , as one can see by considering @xmath27 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath28 is proportional to the size of @xmath1 , while @xmath26 is proportional to the size of @xmath0 , so @xmath29 .    </S>",
    "<S> another of our main goals in this work is to understand the description of few - body observables in the mixed states obtained by the two procedures mentioned before . </S>",
    "<S> for that , we study their expectation values as given by the reduced density matrix , the diagonal ensemble , and the gc ensemble . the results for the first two are similar even if very few sites are traced out and the system sizes are small . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that either tracing out part of the original system or removing the same number of sites and waiting for the reduced system to relax leads to the same results , up to non - extensive boundary terms . </S>",
    "<S> for all practical purposes both procedures are then equivalent . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement with the gc expectation values is also good and improves with increasing system size . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that , for few - body observables , only weak typicality is needed to observe thermal behavior in experiments .    _ </S>",

    "<S> our findings also open the interesting question : which experimentally measurable quantities ( if any ) could distinguish between tracing sites out or cutting them off ?    </S>",

    "<S> this is a regime that needs to be studied by other means , which may allow one to do a proper extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit .    </S>",
