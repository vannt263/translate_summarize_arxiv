    "the understanding of entanglement is at the very heart of quantum information theory ( qit ) . in recent years",
    ", there has been an ongoing effort to characterize qualitatively and quantitatively the entanglement properties of multiparticle systems .",
    "a situation of particular interest in qit consists of several parties that are spatially separated from each other and share a composite system in an entangled state .",
    "this setting conditionates the parties which are typically allowed to communicate through a classical channel to only act locally on their subsystems . but even restricted to local operations assisted with classical communication ( locc )",
    ", the parties can still modify the entanglement properties of the system and in particular they can try to convert an entangled state into another .",
    "this possibility leads to natural ways of defining equivalence relations in the set of entangled states where equivalent states are then said to contain the same kind of entanglement , also of establishing hierarchies between the resulting classes .    for instance , we could agree in identifying any two states which can be obtained from each other with certainty by means of locc . clearly , this criterion is interesting in qit because the parties can use these two states indistintively for exactly the same tasks .",
    "it is a celebrated result @xcite that , when applied to many copies of a state , this criterion leads to identifying all bipartite pure - state entanglement with that of the epr state @xmath0@xcite .",
    "that is , the entanglement of any pure state @xmath1 is asymptotically equivalent , under deterministic locc , to that of the epr state , the entropy of entanglement @xmath2 the entropy of the reduced density matrix of either system @xmath3 or @xmath4 quantifying the amount of epr entanglement contained asymptotically in @xmath1 .",
    "in contrast , recent contributions have shown that in systems shared by three or more parties there are several inequivalent forms of entanglement under asymptotic locc @xcite .",
    "this paper is essentially concerned with the entanglement properties of a single copy of a state , and thus asymptotic results do not apply here . for single copies",
    "it is known that two pure states @xmath5 and @xmath6 can be obtained with certainty from each other by means of locc if and only if they are related by local unitaries lu @xcite .",
    "but even in the simplest bipartite systems , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are typically not related by lu , and continuous parameters are needed to label all equivalence classes @xcite .",
    "that is , one has to deal with infinitely many kinds of entanglement . in this context",
    "an alternative , simpler classification would be advisable .",
    "one such classification is possible if we just demand that the conversion of the states is through stochastic local operations and classical communication ( slocc ) @xcite ; that is , through locc but without imposing that it has to be achieved with certainty . in that case we can establish an equivalence relation stating that two states @xmath5 and @xmath6 are equivalent if the parties have a non - vanishing probability of success when trying to convert @xmath5 into @xmath6 , and also @xmath6 into @xmath5 @xcite",
    ". this relation has been termed stochastic equivalence in ref .",
    "their equivalence under slocc indicates that both states are again suited to implement the same tasks of qit , although this time the probability of a successful performance of the task may differ from @xmath6 to @xmath5 .",
    "notice in addition that since lu are a particular case of slocc , states equivalent under lu are also equivalent under slocc , the new classification being a coarse graining of the previous one .",
    "the main aim of this work is to identify and characterize all possible kinds of pure - state entanglement of three qubits under slocc .",
    "unentangled states , and also those which are product in one party while entangled with respect to the remaining two , appear as expected , trivial cases .",
    "more surprising is the fact that there are two different kinds of genuine tripartite entanglement .",
    "indeed , we will show that any ( non - trivial ) tripartite entangled state can be converted , by means of slocc , into one of two standard forms , namely either the ghz state @xcite = 1/(|000+|111 ) [ ghz ] , or else a second state    trifold entangled states into two sets which are unrelated under locc .",
    "that is , we will see that if @xmath5 can be converted into the state @xmath7 in ( [ ghz ] ) and @xmath6 can be converted into the state @xmath8 in ( [ w ] ) , then it is not possible to transform , not even with only a very small probability of success , @xmath5 into @xmath6 nor the other way round .",
    "the previous result is based on the fact that , unlike the ghz state , not all entangled states of three qubits can be expressed as a linear combination of only two product states .",
    "remarkably enough , the inequivalence under slocc of the states @xmath7 and @xmath8 can alternatively be shown from the fact that the 3-tangle ( residual tangle ) , a measure of tripartite correlations introduced by coffman et .",
    "@xcite , does not increase on average under locc , as we will prove here .",
    "we will then move to the second main goal of this work , namely the analysis of the state @xmath8 .",
    "it can not be obtained from a state @xmath7 by means of locc and thus one could expect , in principle , that it has some interesting , characteristic properties . recall that in several aspects the ghz state can be regarded as the maximally entangled state of three qubits . however , if one of the three qubits is traced out , the remaining state is completely unentangled .",
    "thus , the entanglement properties of the state @xmath7 are very fragile under particle losses",
    ". we will prove that , oppositely , the entanglement of @xmath8 is maximally robust under disposal of any one of the three qubits , in the sense that the remaining reduced density matrices of a pure tripartite state @xmath9 is defined as @xmath10 . ] @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 retain , according to several criteria , the greatest possible amount of entanglement , compared to any other state of three qubits , either pure or mixed .",
    "we will finally analyze entanglement under slocc in more general multipartite systems .",
    "we will show that , for most of these systems , there is typically no chance at all to transform locally a given state into some other if they are chosen randomly , because the space of entangled pure states depends on more parameters than those that can be modified by acting locally on the subsystems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we characterize mathematically the equivalence relation established by stochastic conversions under locc , and illustrate its performance by applying it to the well - known bipartite case . in section iii we move to consider a system of three qubits , for which we prove the existence of 6 classes of states under slocc including the 2 genuinely tripartite ones. section iv is devoted to study the endurance of the entanglement of the state @xmath8 against particle losses . in section v more general multipartite systems are considered .",
    "section vi contains some conclusions .",
    "finally , appendix a to c prove , respectively , some needed results related to slocc , the monotonicity of the 3-tangle under locc and the fact that @xmath8 retains optimally bipartite entanglement when one qubit is traced out .",
    "in this work we define as equivalent the entanglement of two states @xmath5 and @xmath6 of a multipartite system iff local protocols exist that allow the parties to convert each of the two states into the other one with some a priori probability of success . in this approach ,",
    "we follow the definition for stochastic equivalence as given in @xcite .",
    "the underlying motivation for this definition is that , if the entanglement of is @xmath5 and @xmath6 is equivalent , then the two states can be used to perform the same tasks , although the probability of a successful performance of the task may depend on the state that is being used .",
    "sensible enough , this classification would remain useless if in practice we would not be able to find out which states are related by slocc .",
    "let us recall that , all in all , no practical criterion is known so far that determines whether a generic transformation can be implemented by means of locc .",
    "however , we can think of any local protocol as a series of rounds of operations , where in each round a given party manipulates locally its subsystem and communicates classically the result of its operation ( if it included a measurement ) to the rest of parties .",
    "subsequent operations can be made dependent on previous results and the protocol splits into several branches .",
    "this picture is useful because for our purposes we need only focus on one of these branches .",
    "suppose that state @xmath5 can be locally converted into state @xmath6 with non - zero probability .",
    "this means that at least one branch of the protocol does the job .",
    "since we are concerned only with pure states we can always characterize mathematically this branch as an operator which factors out as the tensor product of a local operator for each party .",
    "for instance , in a three - qubit case we would have that @xmath5 can be locally converted into @xmath6 with some finite probability iff an operator @xmath14 exists such that = ab c , [ phipsi ] where operator @xmath3 contains contributions coming from any round in which party a acted on its subsystem , and similarly for operators @xmath4 and @xmath15 .",
    "should be fulfilled if the invertible operators @xmath16 are to come from local povms . in this work",
    "we do not normalize them in order to avoid introducing unimportant constants to the equations . instead ,",
    "both the initial and final states are normalized . ] carrying on with the 3-qubit example , let us now consider for simplicity that both states @xmath5 and @xmath6 have rank 2 reduced density matrices @xmath17 tr@xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "then clearly the rank of operators @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath15 need to be 2 ( see appendix a ) . in other words ,",
    "each of these operators is necessarily invertible , and in particular = a^-1b^-1c^-1 .",
    "we see thus that , under the assumption of maximal rank for the reduced density matrices , two - way convertibility implies the existence of invertible operators @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath15 as in ( [ phipsi ] ) [ actually , one - way convertibility alone has already implied that an invertible local operator ( ilo ) @xmath20 exists ] . obviously , the converse also holds , namely that if an ilo @xmath20 exists then for each direction of the conversion a local protocol can be build that succeeds with non - zero probability . as explained in appendix a in detail , we can get rid of the previous assumption on the ranks and announce with generality ,    * result : * states @xmath5 and @xmath6 are equivalent under stochastic local operations and classical communication slocc iff an invertible local operator ilo relating them [ as in , for instance , equation ( [ phipsi ] ) ] exists .      what does this classification implies in the well - known case @xcite of bipartite systems ?",
    "since lu are included in slocc , we can take the schmidt decomposition of a pure state @xmath21 , @xmath22 , as the starting point for our analysis .",
    "thus , _ i=1^n _",
    "= u_au_b ;   _ i > 0 ,  n _ n,[schmidt1 ] where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are some proper local unitaries , the coefficients @xmath25 decrease with @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the number of non - vanishing terms in the schmidt decomposition . clearly , the ilo ( _ i=1^n _ + _ i = n_+1^n ) 1_b transforms ( [ schmidt1 ] ) into a maximally entangled state _ i^n _ , [ maxi ] which depends only on the schmidt number @xmath27 .",
    "since slocc can not modify the rank of the reduced density matrices @xmath28 and @xmath29 , which is given by @xmath27 , we conclude that in @xmath30 , @xmath22 , there are @xmath31 different kinds of entangled states , corresponding to @xmath31 different classes under slocc .",
    "each of these classes is characterized by a given schmidt number , and we can choose as their representatives the state ( [ maxi ] ) with @xmath32 .",
    "clearly @xmath33 corresponds to states that are less entangled than the rest ( they are , after all , unentangled ) .",
    "this hierarchical relation can be extended to the rest of classes by noting that none - invertible local operators can project out some of the schmidt terms and thus diminish the schmidt number of a state .",
    "therefore the state @xmath5 can be locally converted into the state @xmath6 with some finite probability iff @xmath34 , or in terms of kinds of entanglement , we can say that the entanglement of the class characterized by a given schmidt number is more powerful than that of a class with a smaller schmidt number .    for later reference",
    "we also note that in a two - qubit system , @xmath35 , we can write any state , after using a convenient lu , uniquely as = c _   + s _  ;  c _ s_0 , where @xmath36 stand for cos@xmath37 and sin@xmath37 . this is either a product ( unentangled ) state @xmath38 for @xmath39 or else an entangled state that can be converted into the epr state , ( + ) , [ epr ] with probability @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the entanglement monotone that provides a quantitative description of the non - local resources contained in a single copy of a two - qubit pure state @xcite .",
    "any state @xmath5 can be obtained from state ( [ epr ] ) with certainty , this contributing to the fact that the epr state is considered the maximally entangled state of two qubits .",
    "in this section we analyze a system of three qubits .",
    "we show that slocc split the set of pure states into 6 inequivalent classes , which further structure themselves into a three - grade hierarchy when non - invertible local operations are used to relate them . at the top of the hierarchy we find two inequivalent classes of true tripartite entanglement , which we name ghz - class and w - class after our choice of corresponding representatives .",
    "the three possible classes of bipartite entanglement are accessible ( with some non - vanishing probability ) from _ any _ state of the w and ghz classes by means of a non - invertible local operator . finally , at the bottom of the hierarchy we find non - entangled states .",
    "the ranks r@xmath42 , r@xmath43 and r@xmath44 of the reduced density matrices , together with the range @xmath45 of @xmath12 , will be the main mathematical tools used through the first part of this section . by analysing them",
    "we will be able to make an exhaustive classification of three - qubit entanglement . later",
    "on we will rephrase some of these results in terms of well - known measures of entanglement .",
    "in particular , we will see that the existence of two inequivalent kinds of true tripartite entanglement under slocc is very much related to the fact that the 3-tangle , a measure of tripartite entanglement introduced in @xcite , is an entanglement monotone ( see appendix b ) .    at the end of the section also a practical way to identify the class an arbitrary state belongs to will be discussed .",
    "if at least one of the local ranks r@xmath42 , r@xmath43 or r@xmath44 is 1 , then the pure state of the three qubits factors out as the tensor product of two pure states , and this implies that at least one of the qubits is uncorrelated with the other two .",
    "slocc distinguish states with this feature depending on which qubits are uncorrelated from the rest .",
    "* class a - b - c ( product states ) * + this class corresponds to states with @xmath46 .",
    "they can be taken , after using some convenient lu , into the form = , where we have already relaxed the notation for @xmath47 .",
    "* classes a - bc , ab - c and c - ab + ( bipartite entanglement ) * + these three classes of states contain only bipartite entanglement between two of the qubits , one of the reduced density matrices having rank 1 and the other two having rank 2 .",
    "for example , the states in class @xmath48 possess entanglement between the systems @xmath4 and @xmath15 ( @xmath49 ) and are product with respect to system @xmath3 ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "lu allow us to write uniquely states of the class @xmath48 as    @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "we choose the maximally entangled state |0(|0|0+|1|1 ) [ reprea - bc ] as representative of the class @xmath48 .",
    "any other state within this class can be obtained from ( [ reprea - bc ] ) with certainty by means of locc .",
    "the proof that these four marginal classes are inequivalent under slocc is very simple .",
    "we only need to recall that the local ranks are invariant under ilo ( see appendix a ) .",
    "in what follows we will analyze the more interesting case of @xmath53 . to see that there are two inequivalent classes fulfilling this condition we will have to study possible product decompositions of pure states .",
    "there turns out to be a close connection between convertibility under slocc and the way entangled states can be expressed minimally as a linear combination of product states .",
    "for instance , as we shall prove later on , the ghz and w states have a different number of terms in their minimal product decompositions ( [ ghz ] ) and ( [ w ] ) , namely 2 and 3 product terms respectively , and this readily implies that there is no way to convert one state into the other by means of an ilo @xmath20 .",
    "indeed , let us consider , e.g. , the most general pure state that can be obtained reversibly from a @xmath7 .",
    "it reads abc= ( + ) , [ new ] where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are linearly independent vectors ( since @xmath3 is invertible ) and similarly for the other two qubits .",
    "that is , the minimal number of terms in a product decomposition for the state ( [ new ] ) is also 2 .",
    "actually , we have that also for a general multipartite system ,    * observation : * the minimal number of product terms for any given state remains unchanged under slocc .",
    "this simple observation tells us already that in three qubits there are at least two inequivalent kinds of genuine tripartite entanglement under slocc , that of @xmath7 and that of @xmath8",
    ".    however , we still have to prove that the state @xmath8 can not be expressed as a linear combination of just two product vectors . in order to complete our classification",
    "we also have to show that any pure state of three qubits with maximal local ranks can be reversibly converted into either the state @xmath7 or the state @xmath8 .",
    "we start with an obvious lemma regarding product decompositions :    * lemma : * let @xmath56 be a product decomposition for the state @xmath57 . then the set of states @xmath58 span the range of @xmath59tr@xmath60 .",
    "* proof : * we have that @xmath61 . on the other hand @xmath62 is in the range of @xmath63 iff a state @xmath64 exists such that @xmath65 , that is @xmath66 .",
    "@xmath67    in particular , @xmath68 implies that at least two product terms are needed to expand @xmath69 .",
    "let us suppose that a product decomposition with only two terms is possible , namely = + .",
    "[ 2deco ] then , also according to the previous lemma , @xmath70 and @xmath71 have to span the range of @xmath12 , r@xmath72 .",
    "but r@xmath72 is a two dimensional subspace of @xmath73 .",
    "therefore it always contains either only one or only two product states @xcite [ unless r@xmath72 was supported in @xmath74 or @xmath75 , but we already excluded this possibility because we are considering r@xmath76r@xmath77 .",
    "notice that a two - term decomposition ( [ 2deco ] ) requires that r@xmath72 contains at least two product vectors .",
    "only one product vector in r@xmath72 , and thus the impossibility of decomposition ( [ 2deco ] ) , is going to be precisely the trait of the states in the w - class .",
    "* ghz - class * + let us suppose first that r@xmath72 contains two product vectors , @xmath70 and @xmath71 . then decomposition ( [ 2deco ] ) is possible , and actually unique , with @xmath78 , @xmath79 , where @xmath80 are the two vectors supported in @xmath45 that are biorthonormal to the @xmath81 . in this case",
    "we can use lu in order to take @xmath5 into the useful standard product form ( see also @xcite ) |_ghz=(c_|0|0|0+s_e^i|_a|_b|_c ) , [ ghzclass ] where = c_+s _ + = c_+s _ + = c_+s _ and @xmath82 is a normalization factor",
    ". the ranges for the five parameters are @xmath83 , \\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma \\in ( 0,\\pi/2]$ ] and @xmath84 .",
    "all these states are in the same equivalence class as the @xmath7 ( [ ghz ] ) under slocc . indeed , the ilo (    ll c _ & s_c_e^i + 0 & s_s_e^i    ) (    ll 1 & c _ + 0 & s _    ) (    ll 1 & c _ + 0 & s _    ) , applied to @xmath7 produces the state ( [ ghzclass ] ) .",
    "the ghz state is a remarkable representative of this class .",
    "it is maximally entangled in several senses @xcite .",
    "for instance , it maximally violates bell - type inequalities , the mutual information of measurement outcomes is maximal , it is maximally stable against ( white ) noise and one can locally obtain from a ghz state with unit propability an epr state shared between any two of the three parties .",
    "another relevant feature is that when any one of the three qubits is traced out , the remaining two are in a separable and therefore unentangled state .    * w - class * +",
    "let us move to analyze the case where r@xmath72 contains only one product vector .",
    "we already argued that decomposition ( [ 2deco ] ) is now not possible .",
    "instead we can ( uniquely ) write = + , [ const ] where @xmath85 is the vector of @xmath45 which is orthogonal to @xmath70 , and @xmath86 and @xmath87 are given by @xmath88 and @xmath89 . by means of lu ( [ const ] ) can be always rewritten as = ( + ) & & + + & & ( + ) .",
    "[ wclass2 ] indeed , we first take @xmath70 into @xmath90 . then , since @xmath85 has been chosen orthogonal to @xmath70 , it must become @xmath91 . by requiring that a linear combination of these two vectors has no second product vector",
    "we obtain that @xmath92 @xcite . in addittion the coefficients @xmath93 and @xmath94 can be made positive by absorbing the three relative phases into the definition of state @xmath95 of subsystems @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath15 . thus case ( i ) has been taken into the form ( [ wclass2 ] ) by just using lu . before we showed that 2 terms could not suffice in a product decomposition of the state .",
    "now we see that 3 product terms always do the job , for instance @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 once we took the original state into the standard , unique form = + + + , [ wclass ] where @xmath99 , and @xmath100 .",
    "the parties can locally obtain the state ( [ wclass ] ) from the state @xmath8 in ( [ w ] ) , which we choose as a representative of the class and whose study we postpone for later on , by application of an ilo of the form (    ll & + 0 &    ) (    ll & 0 + 0 &    ) (    ll 1 & 0 + 0 & 1    ) .    before moving to relate these classes by means of non  invertible local operators",
    ", we note that states within the ghz - class and the w - class depend , respectively , on 5 and 3 parameters that can not be changed by means of lu .",
    "previous works @xcite have shown that a generic state of three qubits depends , up to lu , on 5 parameters .",
    "this means that states tipically belong to the ghz - class , or equivalently , that a _ generic _ pure state of three qubits can be locally transformed into a ghz with finite probability of success ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the w - class is of zero measure compared to the ghz - class .",
    "this does not mean , however , that it is irrelevant . in a similar way",
    "as separable mixed states are not of zero measure with respect to entangled states , even though product states are , it is in principle conceivable that mixed states having only w - class entanglement are also not of zero measure in the set of mixed states .      in this subsection",
    ", we investigate the hierarchical relation of the 6 slocc - equivalence classes under non  invertible operators ,",
    "i.e. under general locc .",
    "a non  invertible local operator transforms @xmath5 into @xmath6 according to ( [ phipsi ] ) , but with at least one of the local operators @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath15 having rank 1 .",
    "this means that the local ranks of the pure states can be diminished .",
    "for instance , if the initial state @xmath5 belongs either to the ghz or w class , then a non - invertible operator will diminish at least one of the local ranks .",
    "that is , @xmath6 belongs necessarily to one of the bipartite classes @xmath101 or else is a product state @xmath102 .",
    "thus we have that the classes ghz and w are also inequivalent even under most general locc , whereas e.g. a measurement of the projector @xmath103 with @xmath104 in party @xmath3 maps states within the classes @xmath105 ( [ wclass ] ) and @xmath106 ( [ ghzclass ] ) to states within the class @xmath48 . in a similar way , non  invertible local operators ( local , standard measurements ) can convert states within one of the classes @xmath107 to states within the class @xmath102 .",
    "note that in all cases described above , the inverse transformations , e.g. from the class @xmath102 to one of the classes @xmath107 are impossible as they would imply an increase of the rank of at least one of the reduced density operators @xmath108 .",
    "these results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "several measures have been introduced so far in the literature in order to quantify entanglement .",
    "although this section is mainly concerned with qualitative aspects of multipartite quantum correlations , we would like to relate some of these measures , namely some bipartite ones and the tripartite 3-tangle @xcite(see appendix b ) , to our classification .",
    "remarkably , the existence of two kinds of genuine tripartite entanglement in a three - qubit system , as well as the inequivalence between bipartite and tripartite entanglement , can be easily understood from the non - increasing character of these measures under locc . in addittion",
    ", the 3-tangle allows for a systematic and practical identification of which class under slocc any pure state belongs to .    for each @xmath109 and @xmath15 we can regard the three - qubit system as a bipartite system , with qubit @xmath110 , say @xmath3 for concreteness , being one part of the system and the remaining two qubits , @xmath4 and @xmath15 , being the other .",
    "correspondingly , a state @xmath5 of the three qubits can be viewed as a bipartite state @xmath111 . for bipartite states several measures",
    "are known , which are entanglement monotones @xcite ; that is , which can not be increased , on average , under locc .",
    "for instance , we already mentioned the entropy of entanglement @xmath112 for asymptotic conversions given by the entropy @xmath113 of the eigenvalues of @xmath28 and the monotone @xmath114 for the single copy case which is given by the smallest eigenvalue @xmath115 of @xmath28 .",
    "they all satisfy that vanish for product states ( corresponding to @xmath28 with rank 1 ) while having a positive value for any other state ( corresponding to @xmath28 with rank 2 ) .",
    "thus we can interpret the inequivalence under slocc of states whose reduced density matrices differ in rank also in terms of the impossibility of creating any of the bipartite measures .",
    "for instance , a state in the @xmath48 class has @xmath116 , and thus can not be transformed with any finite probability into a state of the @xmath117 class , because this would have @xmath118 .",
    "we conclude that the monotonicity of these measures readily split the set of pure states of three qubits into five subsets which are inequivalent under slocc , namely unentagled states @xmath102 , the three classes @xmath48 , @xmath117 and @xmath119 containing only bipartite entanglement , and a fifth subset of entangled states with @xmath120 ( i.e. r@xmath121r@xmath76r@xmath122 ) .",
    "bipartite measures can not , however , determine the inequivalence of the ghz and w classes .",
    "is there any known measure of tripartite entanglement which can distinguish between these two classes ? the 3-tangle does .",
    "indeed , it can be computed from the product decompositions ( [ ghzclass ] ) and ( [ wclass ] ) ( see @xcite for details ) , and reads ( _ ghz)=(2ks_s_s_s_c_)^2 [ tangle ] = 0[taughz ] for any state in the ghz class , while it vanishes for any state in the w class . in the appendix",
    "b we prove that the 3-tangle is an entanglement monotone , a very desirable property for any quantity aiming at measuring entanglement .",
    "consequently , a state in the w class can not be transformed by means of locc ( and in particular slocc ) to a state in the ghz class , which is an independent proof of the fact that the two kinds of true tripartite entanglement are indeed inequivalent under slocc .",
    "given an arbitrary state @xmath5 of three qubits , expressed in any basis , it may be interesting to know , for instance , whether it can be converted by means of locc into a ghz or a w state , if any , or into a epr state shared between two of the parties . in our original analysis of the classes",
    "we already have provided a constructive method , based on the analysis of r@xmath123 and r@xmath72 , to determine the class of @xmath5 under slocc .",
    "analysing the r@xmath72 may , however , not be the most practical way to proceed . here",
    "we suggest to proceed instead according to the following two steps :    * compute @xmath124 , @xmath109 and @xmath15 , and check whether they have a vanishing determinant .",

    "the residual , two - qubit states @xmath11 , @xmath13 and @xmath12 are in general mixed states .",
    "there are several measures of entanglement of mixed states and therefore multiple ways of quantifying how much ( mixed - state ) bipartite entanglement the state @xmath5 turns into when one of the qubits is traced out .",
    "nevertheless , most of the criteria we have examined coincide in pointing out the state @xmath8 as the one that maximally retains bipartite entanglement .",

    "we conclude that the state @xmath8 is the state of three - qubits whose entanglement has the highest degree of endurance against loss of one of the three qubits .",
    "we conceive this property as important in any situation where one of the three parties sharing the system , say alice , may suddenly decide not to cooperate with the other two .",
    "notice that even in the case that alice would decide to try to destroy the entanglement between bob and claire , this would not be possible , since any local action on a can not prevent bob and claire from sharing , at least , the entanglement contained in @xmath12 ( for instance , by simply ignoring alice s actions ) .",
    "therefore , although essentially tripartite , the entanglement of the state @xmath8 is also readily bipartite , in contrast to that of the state @xmath7 , which only after some local manipulation can be brought into a bipartite form .",
    "in this last section we would like to apply the same techniques to analyze the entanglement of more general multipartite systems . we will learn that the set of entangled states is a rather inaccessible jungle for the local explorer , for two pure states @xmath5 and @xmath6 are typically not connected by means of locc , so that the parties are usually unable to convert states locally .",

    "we want to identify vectors which are related by means of a ilo .",
    "a general one - party , invertible operator @xmath3 must have non - vanishing determinant , which we can fix to one , det@xmath149 , because the operator @xmath150 only differs in that it introduces in the transformed states an extra constant factor @xmath151 , which we have already addressed .",
    "that is , @xmath152 , and it depends on @xmath153 real parameters .",
    "therefore the set of equivalence classes under slocc , , depends _ at least _ on @xmath154 parameters .",
    "this lower bound allows for a finite number of classes for @xmath155 , but shows that for any larger number @xmath147 of qubits there are infinitely many classes , labeled by at least one continuous parameter .",
    "the reason is that the number of parameters from a state @xmath5 which the parties can modify by means of a general ilo @xmath156 grows linearly with @xmath147 ( @xmath157 for the multi - qubit case ) , whereas the number of parameters required to specify @xmath5 grows exponentially with @xmath147 .    more generally ,",
    "if the hilbert space is given by @xmath158 , then the set of equivalence classes under slocc , , depends at least on @xmath159 .",
    "this shows that only for @xmath155 there are still some systems with ( potentially ) only a finite number of classe under slocc , namely those with hilbert space @xmath160 , that is , having a qubit as at least one of the subsystems . in all other cases",
    ", one finds an infinite number of classes .",
    "we notice that even allowing for non - invertible local operations the amount of parameters that can be changed by local manipulations is typically smaller than that the state depends on .",
    "that is , the subset of states that can be reached locally from a given state @xmath5 is of zero measure in the set of states of the multipartite system . recall that in the bipartite scenario , @xmath161 , there is always a maximally entangled state from which all the other states can be locally prepared with certainty of success .",
    "we see now that , in constrast , there is typically in a multipartite system no state from which all the others can be prepared , not even with some probability of success . of course",
    ", the parties can always resort to , say , using a sufficient amount of epr states distributed among them to prepare any multipartite state by standard teleportation .",
    "this implies , however , using an initial state ( that of many epr states ) which belongs to a hilbert space much larger than the hilbert space of the state the parties are trying to create , and thus does not change the previous conclusion .",
    "let us have a look at the generalized form @xmath162 of the state @xmath129 ( [ w ] ) .",
    "we define the state    symmetric state including @xmath163 zeros and @xmath164 ones . for example",
    ", we obtain for @xmath165    entanglement of this state is again very robust against particle losses , i.e. the state @xmath162 remains entangled even if any @xmath166 parties lose the information about their particle .",
    "this means that any two out of @xmath147 parties possess an entangled state , independently of whether the remaining @xmath167 parties decide to cooperate with them or not .",
    "this can be seen by computing the reduced density operator @xmath11 of @xmath162 , i.e. by tracing out all but the first and the second systems . by symmetry of the state @xmath162",
    ", we have that all reduced density operators @xmath168 are identical and we obtain _ = ( 2    _ ( w_n)= , which shows that @xmath168 is entangled , even distillable .",

    "in this work , we investigated equivalence classes of multipartite states specified by stochastic local operations and classical communication .",
    "we showed that for pure states of three qubits there are 6 different classes of this kind .",
    "in particular , we found that there are two inequivalent types of genuine tripartite entanglement , represented by the ghz state and the state w. we showed that the state w is the state of three qubits that retains a maximal amount of bipartite entanglement when any one of the three qubits is traced out .",
