    "sinc function is defined as @xcite @xmath0 sinc function is widely used in practical applications due to its remarkable sampling property @xcite . in particular , using the sinc function we can approximate a function @xmath1 by taking appropriate set of the sampling points @xmath2 along some interval @xmath3 $ ] as @xcite : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the total number of the sapling points , @xmath6 is the small parameter and @xmath7 is the error term .",
    "this remarkable sampling property of the sinc function can be used , for example , in numerical integration or differentiation @xcite .",
    "although according to equation the sinc function can approximate quite accurately a function by sampling , its application is not always practically convenient .",
    "for example , suppose that @xmath8 is a multivariable function and suppose that it can be represented as a multiplication of two functions @xmath9 .",
    "then the expansion of the function @xmath10 in terms of sinc function series leads to sum of integrals of kind @xmath11 that may not be necessarily integrable or expressed in terms of the rational functions for efficient computation since the sinc function is not an elementary function .",
    "it this work we propose a methodology of sampling based on the incomplete cosine expansion series of the sinc function that effectively resolves this problem and , as an example , we demonstrate its effectiveness in derivation of a new approximation of the voigt / complex error function where only @xmath12 summation terms are sufficient to obtain accuracy better than @xmath13 over almost all the complex domain of practical importance .",
    "this example illustrates how the incomplete cosine expansion of the sinc function can be applied as a useful and versatile technique in numerical integration .",
    "vita discovered that the sinc function can be represented as infinite product of the cosine functions @xcite : @xmath14 there is a product - to - sum identity @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is an integer .",
    "comparing identities and we can conclude , therefore , that @xmath17 consequently , at any finite integer @xmath16 we can refer to the right side of equation as incomplete cosine expansion of the sinc function .    in sampling techniques involving the sinc function ,",
    "it is quite common to replace its argument as @xmath18 ( see for example @xcite ) . following this convention , we rewrite the incomplete cosine expansion of the sinc function as the series @xmath19    one useful property of this expansion occurs at infinitesimal @xmath6 : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the kronecker delta , equal to @xmath22 at @xmath23 and equal to @xmath24 at @xmath25 .",
    "this interesting behaviour can be proved from the observation that : @xmath26    since the integer @xmath16 in this application is implied to be finite , the incomplete cosine expansion is a periodic function with period @xmath27 that is dependent upon the values @xmath16 and @xmath6 . a larger value of the integer @xmath16 increases the number of the summation terms in the incomplete cosine expansion that leads to an increase of the period @xmath27 .    as the incomplete cosine expansion approximates the original sinc function @xmath28 within the range @xmath29 $ ] near the origin",
    ", we can write the approximation as @xmath30    figure 1 shows the results calculated at @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the period of the incomplete cosine expansion is @xmath33 . for comparison",
    "the original sinc function is also shown by blue line .",
    "it should be noted that approximation is not the only incomplete cosine expansion of the sinc function .",
    "examples of other incomplete cosine expansions are given in appendix a.      the efficiency of the incomplete cosine expansion can be demonstrated by application to the approximation of the complex error function defined as @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a complex argument .",
    "numerical approximations of the complex error function , also known as the faddeeva function , find broad applications in many fields of physics , astronomy and chemistry and its efficient algorithmic implementation stills remains a hot topic ( see , for example , optimized algorithm in a recent work @xcite ) .",
    "mathematically , the real part of the complex error function @xmath36 $ ] , widely known as the voigt function @xcite , represents a convolution of cauchy ( or lorentz ) and gaussian ( or doppler ) distributions . the voigt function can be used to describe accurately spectral line broadening effects , for example , in atmospheric molecules @xcite , celestial bodies @xcite , photo - luminescent materials @xcite and so on . the simultaneous lorentz and doppler broadenings occur primarily due to the heisenberg uncertainty principle , multiple collisions between particles and the velocity distribution of colliding particles .",
    "the imaginary part of the complex error function @xmath37 $ ] is also a useful function that can be used , for example , to describe the spectral behavior of refractive index in dispersive materials @xcite .",
    "plasma physics involving small - amplitude waves propagating through maxwellian media is based on the plasma dispersion function as given by @xcite @xmath38    the normal distribution function , applied in statistics and probability theory , can be expressed in terms of complex error function as @xcite @xmath39.\\ ] ]    the error function of complex argument can also be expressed in terms of complex error function as follows @xmath40 for example , the error function can be applied in a sub - pixel interpolation technique to star - image processing @xcite .    consequently , the complex error function can be used as a versatile tool in applied mathematics and computational physics as the plasma dispersion function @xmath41 , the normal distribution function @xmath42 and the error function @xmath43 are simply the reformulated variations of the complex error function @xmath44 .",
    "other functions that represent reformulations of the complex error function are the fresnel integral @xcite , the dawsons integral @xcite and gordeyevs integral @xcite .",
    "as we discussed above , the application of the sinc function may not be always efficient .",
    "one of the representations of the complex error function is given by ( see equation ( 3 ) in @xcite , see also @xcite for more details ) @xmath45 making change of variable @xmath46 in the integral leads to @xcite @xmath47 as we can see , the integrand in the integral is a multivariable function .",
    "obviously , this integrand can be rearranged as @xmath48 , where @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "consequently , according to equation we can approximate equation now as @xmath51    the most simplest way is to take equidistantly separated sampling points @xmath52 with step between two adjacent sampling points equal to @xmath6 . with this assumption the approximation yields @xmath53    although each integral term in the right side of equation is integrable through hyperbolic arctangent function , this method is absolutely inappropriate for rapid computation since the resultant approximation of the complex error function is not a rational approximation",
    ".    this problem can be effectively resolved by using the incomplete cosine expansion . specifically , we can write @xmath54    since the incomplete cosine expansion is a periodic function with period @xmath27 , the obtained approximation is also periodic as it can be seen in the fig .",
    "along with the pick at the origin coinciding with original exponential function @xmath55 shown by blue line , we can also observe additional negative and positive peaks at @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "therefore , the exponential function @xmath55 can be reasonably approximated only within the domain @xmath58 .",
    "let us introduce a real constant @xmath59 and multiply both sides of equation by @xmath60 .",
    "if the constant @xmath61 is large enough , say equal or greater than @xmath62 , the restriction @xmath58 in equation can be effectively eliminated as @xmath60 is a rapidly decreasing function that damps to zero all additional peaks as the argument @xmath63 increases .",
    "this tendency can be observed from fig . 3 by comparing two curves at @xmath64 and @xmath65 shown by black and red colors , respectively . as the constant @xmath61 increases , all additional peaks are attenuated significantly .",
    "by @xmath66 they practically vanish and only the initial part of the approximated function @xmath67 remains unaffected .",
    "thus , we can write @xmath68        from equation it follows that @xmath69 as the peak of the exponential function @xmath70 is shifted to right from the origin by @xmath71 , parameter @xmath61 can be regarded , therefore , as a shift constant .    taking into account that @xmath72 and substituting approximation into leads to @xmath73 once again , assuming equidistant separation of the sampling points @xmath52 , we can rewrite approximation in form @xmath74 each integral term on the right side of approximation is now integrable and",
    "can be expressed as a rational function .",
    "consequently , from equation it follows that @xmath75 > 0,\\ ] ] where @xmath76 @xmath77 and @xmath78    although the approximation is accurate , it is not rapid due to the double summation .",
    "however , this problem can be readily resolved by defining the following constants @xmath79 and @xmath80 thus , after some trivial rearrangement we obtain @xmath81 > 0,\\ ] ] where @xmath82 and @xmath83    approximation is a rational function since it contains no trigonometric or exponential functions dependent on the input parameters @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "furthermore , all coefficients @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 involved in computation are independent of the input parameters @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , the application of the approximation is advantageous for rapid computation .",
    "a further advantage is that the approximation is readily integrable with respect to parameter @xmath84 . as a result",
    ", it can be used for the spectrally integrated ( or frequency integrated ) voigt function @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that for program coding the approximation can be conveniently rearranged in form @xmath89 where @xmath90 is defined in order to deal with simplified @xmath91-function .    to estimate the accuracy of this approximation",
    ", we define the relative errors for its real and imaginary parts as @xmath92 - { \\mathop{\\rm re}\\nolimits } \\left [ { { w_{ref.}}\\left ( { x , y } \\right ) } \\right]}}{{{\\mathop{\\rm re}\\nolimits } \\left [ { { w_{ref.}}\\left ( { x , y } \\right ) } \\right ] } } } \\right|\\ ] ] and @xmath93 - { \\mathop{\\rm im}\\nolimits } \\left [ { { w_{ref.}}\\left ( { x , y } \\right ) } \\right]}}{{{\\mathop{\\rm im}\\nolimits } \\left [ { { w_{ref.}}\\left ( { x , y } \\right ) } \\right ] } } } \\right|,\\ ] ] where @xmath94 is the reference . the highly accurate reference values can be generated by using , for example , the program codes algorithm 680 @xcite or recently published algorithm 916 @xcite",
    ".    at sufficiently large value @xmath95 , say at @xmath96 , the computation of the complex error function is not problematic and many approximations are available in scientific literature for rapid and accurate computation ( see , for example , the continuous fractional approximation in @xcite , the gauss  hermit quadrature @xcite or rational approximation in @xcite ) .",
    "since in quantitative spectroscopy the range for the input parameters required for computation is @xmath97 and @xmath98 @xcite , the most difficult domain for computation is @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "the proposed approximation of the complex error function very accurately covers this domain .",
    "figure 4a shows the logarithm of the relative error @xmath101 for the real part of the complex error function approximation calculated at @xmath32 , @xmath102 , @xmath31 and @xmath103 . in the most of the domain ,",
    "the accuracy in real part is better than @xmath13 .",
    "although in the real part the accuracy deteriorates at @xmath104 , it still remains high and in the region @xmath105 it is better than @xmath106 .",
    "figure 4b illustrates the logarithm of the relative error @xmath107 for the imaginary part of the complex error function approximation also computed at @xmath32 , @xmath102 , @xmath31 and @xmath103 . in the most of the domain ,",
    "the accuracy in imaginary part is better than @xmath13 .",
    "the accuracy deteriorates at @xmath108 , but it is still high and better than @xmath106 . it should be noted that in radiative transfer spectroscopy the accuracy better than @xmath106 is more than enough for practical applications .",
    "consider the weidemans approximation ( see equation ( 38-i ) and corresponding matlab code in @xcite ) @xmath109 > 0,\\ ] ] where @xmath110 and @xmath111            are the expansion coefficients that can be determined elegantly by fft method .",
    "as weidemans approximation is a rational function , it is rapid in computation and , therefore , widely used in many applications . by default , weideman applied the integer @xmath112 in equation .",
    "figure 5a shows the logarithm of the relative error @xmath101 for the real part of the complex error function approximation . in the most of the domain in real part",
    "the accuracy is about @xmath113 and deteriorates at @xmath104 .",
    "specifically , in the region @xmath105 the accuracy can not be better than @xmath114 .",
    "figure 5b illustrates the logarithm of the relative error @xmath107 for the imaginary part of the complex error function approximation .",
    "the accuracy in the imaginary part is essentially better . particularly , the accuracy in the most of the domain is about @xmath115 and deteriorates to @xmath116 in the region @xmath105 .            as compared to the weidemans approximation ,",
    "the approximation is more rapid in computation especially at extended size of the input array @xmath117 .",
    "this is because the weidemans approximation is dependent on the power @xmath118 .",
    "as a result of the exponentiations in polynomial terms , the weidemans approximation requires more computational resources when the size of the input array @xmath119 exceeds several million elements .    comparing figs .",
    "4a , 4b with 5a , 5b , one can see that while both approximations use 16 summation terms ( @xmath120 in approximation and @xmath112 in approximation ) , the complex error function approximation based on incomplete cosine expansion is more accurate than the weidemans approximation by several orders of the magnitude .",
    "these results illustrate that the application of the incomplete cosine expansion to a challenging problem can produce a highly accurate and efficient functional approximation .",
    "we present a method of functional approximation based on incomplete cosine expansion series as a practical alternative to the traditional sinc function sampling .",
    "our analysis shows that applying this approach to the complex error function we obtain an approximation that with same numbers of summation terms provides better accuracy than weidemans approximation by several orders of the magnitude . as application of the incomplete cosine expansion results in integration with only elementary functions ,",
    "the approach is amenable to further mathematical flexibility and advantageous for accurate and rapid computation .",
    "this work is supported by thoth technology inc . , discovery channel canada and york university .",
    "since @xmath121 the sinc function can also be represented as the limit @xmath122 this signifies that the upper value in summation may not be necessarily equal to @xmath123 and , in general , it can be taken as an arbitrary integer @xmath124 : @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the corresponding period that increases with increasing integer @xmath124 .",
    "the equation is a specific case of a generalized equation that occurs at @xmath127 .",
    "another expansion of the sinc function can be readily obtained by using the poisson summation formula : @xmath128 where notation @xmath129 denotes the floor function and @xmath130 is the corresponding period . from this equation",
