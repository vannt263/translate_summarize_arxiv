    "in recent years , the holographic relationship between strongly - coupled field theories and higher - dimensional theories that include gravity ( the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite ) has allowed quantitative predictions for observables in qcd that are in surprisingly good agreement with the experimental data  @xcite .",
    "encouraged by the success of such models , a similar approach to studying technicolor - like models of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) based on the ads / cft correspondence has led to new possibilities for physics that may be probed at the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite .",
    "holographic technicolor models are closely related to extra - dimensional models of electroweak symmetry breaking that have been studied in much detail recently  @xcite , but their philosophy is different . in the ads",
    "/ cft approach , the form of the 5d holographic theory is suggested by the mechanisms of chiral symmetry breaking and confinement as they appear in string theory constructions of models similar to qcd .    one benefit of holographic models rooted in d - brane configurations of string theory , as opposed to in the phenomenological models of refs .",
    "@xcite , is that the large-@xmath2 and curvature corrections , for example , are well defined and can , in principle , be calculated or estimated systematically .",
    "furthermore , the gauge theories described by low - energy fluctuations of d - brane configurations are known , so that both sides of the holographic duality are well understood .",
    "the stringy model of this sort most similar to the light quark sector of qcd is the d4-d8-@xmath0model of sakai and sugimoto  @xcite , which we review in section  [ sec : ss ] .",
    "the sakai - sugimoto model is nonsupersymmetric , contains @xmath3 flavors of massless quarks transforming in the fundamental representation of the su@xmath4 gauge group , and is confining with non - abelian chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "( a related model based on d6-branes rather than d8-branes does not have this last feature  @xcite . ) at large @xmath2 and large t hooft coupling @xmath5 with @xmath6 , the spectrum of resonances , their decay widths and couplings can be reliably calculated  @xcite .",
    "minimal technicolor models are essentially scaled up versions of qcd , in which an su(2)@xmath7u(1 ) subgroup of the chiral symmetry is gauged .",
    "chiral symmetry breaking due to the strong technicolor interactions then translates into electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "a nice feature of technicolor models is that they avoid the hierarchy problem associated with scalar higgs fields . to produce fermion masses ,",
    "however , the technicolor sector must be extended , and it is challenging to accommodate a heavy top quark in such models while avoiding large flavor - changing neutral current effects . also disappointing is that corrections to precision electroweak observables are estimated to be generically too large to be consistent with lep data  @xcite .",
    "walking technicolor models , with couplings that run more slowly than in qcd , provide one approach to solving these problems ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "if the electroweak subgroup of the chiral symmetry in the sakai - sugimoto model is gauged , then the model becomes a technicolor - like model of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the sakai - sugimoto model has , in addition to @xmath2 , @xmath3 and the t hooft coupling , a free parameter @xmath8 , not present in qcd , that fixes the d8-@xmath0brane configuration .",
    "( the definition of @xmath8 is given in section  [ sec : ss ] . )",
    "we can therefore hope that for some choice of @xmath8 the model will be consistent with precision electroweak constraints .",
    "indeed , in phenomenological holographic technicolor models , additional parameters not present in qcd allow for corrections to precision electroweak observables that render them consistent with current bounds  @xcite .",
    "the sakai - sugimoto model also includes a larger group of symmetries ( a global so(5 ) symmetry ) and states ( kaluza - klein modes around a circle of size comparable to the confining scale ) not present in qcd .",
    "the existence of these additional states may be considered a prediction of the model .",
    "we find it interesting that in calculable string theory models with chiral symmetry breaking it seems to be difficult to separate additional physics from the confining scale . in our adaptation of the sakai - sugimoto model to ewsb , one expects technicolor - like resonances to be discovered together with kaluza - klein modes of a large extra dimension .",
    "the most serious problem for old - fashioned technicolor models is the generically large value of the peskin - takeuchi @xmath1-parameter , which parameterizes a class of corrections to precision electroweak observables  @xcite . in section  [ sec : modes ] , we calculate several of the lightest vector and axial vector resonance masses , their decay constants , and their contribution to the @xmath1-parameter , as a function of @xmath8 ( the free parameter in the model ) for fixed @xmath9 and @xmath2 .",
    "we find that the contribution of the lightest resonances to @xmath1 is negative , which would seem to make such models promising candidates for a theory of ewsb .",
    "however , we also sum over all modes via a holographic sum rule and demonstrate a surprising non - decoupling of heavy resonances .",
    "the non - decoupling of contributions to the @xmath1-parameter is a consequence of the rapid growth of the decay constants as a function of resonance number , which offsets the suppression from the increase in resonance masses . including the effects of the entire tower of resonances , we find that the @xmath1-parameter in the model is generally large and positive .    the decoupling of the heavier resonances can be recovered if we introduce an artificial ultraviolet ( uv ) regulator that brings the d8-brane boundary in from infinity .",
    "although only the first few resonances are required in this limit to accurately compute @xmath1 , we then find that their contribution typically becomes positive and large . for regulator scales lower than the weak scale",
    ", we show that it is possible to obtain positive values of @xmath1 consistent with current bounds .",
    "we discuss the phenomenological implications of these results , and other approaches to decreasing the @xmath1 parameter , in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the d4-d8-@xmath0system of sakai and sugimoto @xcite is similar to qcd in many ways .",
    "if there are @xmath2 d4 branes and @xmath3 sets of d8 and @xmath0branes , then the d - brane configuration describes an su(@xmath2 ) gauge theory coupled to @xmath3 flavors of fermions in the fundamental representation , which we will refer to as either quarks or techniquarks depending on the context .",
    "the d4 branes are wrapped on a circle ; antiperiodic boundary conditions for the fermions break supersymmetry and lift the masses of the extraneous ( adjoint ) fermions .",
    "the quarks experience chiral symmetry breaking and confinement , as is qualitatively understood by properties of the d8-brane configuration and the background geometry .",
    "properties of the hadronic bound states ( masses , decay rates and couplings ) in this system are calculable , as we review here .",
    "the d4 brane geometry , in the notation of @xcite ( except for the signature of the metric ) , is given by , @xmath11 where @xmath12 the d4 brane extends in the @xmath13 and @xmath14 directions , where the @xmath14 direction is compactified on a circle . in the remaining dimensions ,",
    "the metric is spherically symmetric : @xmath15 is the radial coordinate and @xmath16 is the metric of the unit 4-sphere .",
    "the scale @xmath17 is a free parameter , but to avoid a singularity at @xmath18 the variable @xmath14 is periodic with period @xmath19",
    ". we will refer to the geometry projected onto the @xmath14 and @xmath15 directions as the @xmath15-tube , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : u - tube ] .",
    "the d8 and @xmath0branes extend in the @xmath20 and 4-sphere directions , and follow a minimal energy trajectory @xmath21 on the @xmath15-tube .",
    "physical results will depend on @xmath22 and @xmath17 in the combination , @xmath23 so that there is a single dimensionful scale , @xmath24 , governing the dynamics of the model .",
    "the boundary of the spacetime is at @xmath25 , which is topologically @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is 3 + 1 dimensional minkowski space ( with the lorentz invariance of the 4d theory ) .",
    "the dilaton appears in the dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) action governing the dynamics of the d8 branes ; in the d4 brane background the dilaton profile is , @xmath28 the rr four - form is also turned on in the d4-brane background , but we will not need its profile in what follows .",
    "confinement in the model is related to the termination of the geometry at @xmath17 ,",
    "_ i.e. _ the restriction @xmath29 .",
    "one way to understand confinement in this context is to consider a string stretched from the boundary at one point in @xmath27 to another as a function of separation of the string endpoints .",
    "the minimum energy string extends away from the boundary , and for large enough separation between string endpoints , will stretch all the way to @xmath17 . for still larger separation , the string stretches from infinity along the @xmath15-tube to @xmath17 ,",
    "moves along @xmath27 , and returns to @xmath25 .",
    "the motion along @xmath27 at roughly fixed @xmath30 gives a contribution to the energy of the string proportional to the separation of the endpoints along @xmath27 .",
    "this linear potential is a signature of confinement .",
    "one striking difference between qcd and the sakai - sugimoto model is that the latter predicts additional kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes associated with the compact dimensions .",
    "notably , @xmath24 sets both the confinement scale and the mass scale of the kk modes ; above the confining scale , the additional dimension parameterized by the coordinate @xmath14 becomes apparent .",
    "while it is common to ignore the kaluza - klein modes , and assume that only the 4d model of the lowest modes is realistic , we consider the existence of these kaluza - klein excitations as a prediction of holographic ewsb .",
    "thus , we expect a tower of heavy gauge bosons to appear in addition to technicolor - like resonances .",
    "the d4-d8-@xmath0configuration also has an so(5 ) symmetry from the 4-sphere directions , which becomes an so(5 ) global symmetry in the field theory , leading to additional kk modes .    in order to decouple string loop ( @xmath31 ) and gravity ( @xmath32 ) corrections , @xmath2 and @xmath33",

    "@xcite . in our case",
    ", we may consider a 5d model motivated by the ads / cft correspondence , but with bulk geometry described by the induced metric on the d8-branes in the d4-d8 system .",
    "the location of the uv boundary determines the size of the radial dimension and , hence , the resonance mass scale .",
    "since the higher resonances decouple more quickly as the size of the radial dimension is reduced , we can test the agreement of the sum over modes with the sum rule approach .",
    "[ fig : uvreg ] demonstrates the behavior of the @xmath1 parameter as the boundary location is varied .",
    "here we work in the limit @xmath38 , and map the @xmath15 coordinate to a finite interval @xmath214 , via the relations @xmath215 the physical boundaries at @xmath25 correspond to @xmath216 .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : uvreg ] that the lightest four pairs of vector and axial - vector modes provide a better approximation of the @xmath1 parameter as @xmath217 increases .",
    "we also note that for a severely regulated theory , @xmath218 , the @xmath1 parameter can be made consistent with the current limit @xmath219  @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to a radial dimension of proper length approximately @xmath220 . for the value @xmath221 tev obtained in the previous section",
    ", the radial dimension has size approximately ( 3.6 tev)@xmath222 .",
    "it is interesting to note that this version of holographic duality for chiral symmetries , with two boundary components rather than the single boundary of anti - de sitter space , was anticipated by son and stephanov in ref .",
    "they considered a model of mesons with light - quark quantum numbers based on an extension of the notion of hidden local symmetry  @xcite .",
    "the model is equivalent to a deconstructed extra - dimensional su@xmath4 gauge theory with an su@xmath49su@xmath50 flavor symmetry corresponding to the global symmetries of the fields localized at the two boundaries . to calculate current correlators , the global symmetries",
    "are weakly gauged , and the gauge fields at the ends of the extra dimension act as sources for the currents .",
    "the configurations with su@xmath50 gauge fields turned on at one boundary or the other are analogous to the non - normalizable modes localized at the boundary of the d8 brane or @xmath0brane segment .",
    "a deconstructed  @xcite version of the sakai - sugimoto model would truncate the model to a finite number of resonances . since we have found that the light resonances in the sakai - sugimoto model can contribute negatively to the @xmath1-parameter , it would be interesting to study the behavior of the @xmath1-parameter as a function of the number of lattice sites of the deconstructed model .",
    "again , such an approach deviates from string theory since there is no simple deconstruction of the radial dimension that captures all of gravitational physics of the original theory , even in the limit of a large number of lattice sites .",
    "nevertheless , deconstruction often leads to 4d theories that possess important features of the higher - dimensional theory that they are designed to approximate . in the present case",
    ", the sakai - sugimoto model would simply provide a paradigm for the choice of gauge groups and symmetry breaking pattern in the deconstructed theory .",
    "electroweak constraints would require detailed study , especially away from the large @xmath2 limit where radiative corrections are generally non - negligible and must be taken into account .",
    "it would also be interesting to compare these deconstructed models with existing models of electroweak symmetry breaking that were motivated in part by deconstruction of extra dimensions , such as little higgs models  @xcite .    in summary",
    ", we have studied the viability of the sakai - sugimoto model of intersecting d4 and d8 branes as a technicolor - like model of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "we determined the masses of the technicolor resonances and their decay constants in terms of the electroweak scale .",
    "we found that the contribution of the strong dynamics to the peskin - takeuchi @xmath1 parameter is larger by at least an order of magnitude than the experimentally allowed value @xmath223 , even allowing for adjustment of the d8-brane configuration .",
    "however , we observed that the lightest pair of vector and axial vector resonances contributes negatively to @xmath1 , while the final result reflects a non - decoupling of heavy resonances that seems to be sensitive to the details of the model .",
    "the model can be made consistent with precision electroweak constraints by artificially introducing an ultraviolet regulator , as we showed in fig .",
    "[ fig : uvreg ] , or perhaps by deconstructing the model along the radial direction in order to truncate it to the lightest several technicolor resonances . in order to become a complete model of electroweak symmetry breaking",
