    "pictographs commonly referred to as ` emoji ' have grown from their introduction in the late 1990 s by japanese cell phone manufacturers to an incredibly popular form of computer mediated communication ( cmc ) .",
    "instagram reported that as of april 2015 , 40% of all messages posted on instagram consist of emoji  @xcite . from a 1% random sample of all tweets published from july 2013 to july 2016 ,",
    "the service emojitracker reported its processing of over 15.6 billion tweets with emoji .",
    "creators of the swiftkey keyboard for mobile devices also report that 6 billion messages per day contain emoji  @xcite .",
    "even authorities on language use have acknowledged emoji ; the american dialect society selected ` eggplant ' as the most notable emoji of the year , and the oxford dictionary recently awarded ` face with tears of joy ' as the word of the year in 2015 .",
    "all these reports suggest that emoji are now an undeniable part of the world s electronic communication vernacular .",
    "people use emoji to add color and whimsiness to their messages  @xcite and to articulate hard to describe emotions  @xcite .",
    "perhaps by design , emoji were defined with no rigid semantics attached to them , allowing people to develop their own use and interpretation .",
    "thus , similar to words , emoji can take on different meanings depending on context and part - of - speech  @xcite .",
    "for example , consider the three emoji , , and and their use in multiple tweets in figure  [ emojiensesexamples ] . depending on context",
    ", we see that each of these emoji can take on wildly different meanings .",
    "people use the emoji to mean laughter , happiness , and humor ; the emoji to discuss killings , shootings or anger ; and the emoji to express that something is expensive , working hard to earn money or simply to refer to money .    knowing the meaning of an emoji can significantly enhance applications that study , analyze , and summarize electronic communications .",
    "for example , rather than stripping away emoji in a preprocessing step , sentiment analysis application reported in  @xcite uses emoji to improve its sentiment score . however , knowing the meaning of an emoji could further improve the sentiment score . a good example for this scenario would be the emoji , where people use it to describe both happiness ( using senses such as laugh , joy ) and sadness ( using senses such as cry , tear ) . knowing under which sense the emoji is being used could help to understand its sentiment better . but to enable this , a system needs to understand the particular meaning or _ sense _ of the emoji in a particular instance .",
    "however , no resources have been made available for this task  @xcite .",
    "this calls for the need of a machine readable _ sense inventory for emoji _ that can provide information such as : ( i ) the plausible part - of - speech tags ( pos tags ) for a particular use of emoji ; ( ii ) the definition of an emoji and the senses it is used in ; ( iii ) example uses of emoji for each sense ; and ( iv ) links of emoji senses to other inventories or knowledge bases such as babelnet or wikipedia .",
    "current research on emoji analysis has been limited to emoji - based sentiment analysis  @xcite , emoji - based emotion analysis  @xcite , and twitter profile classification  @xcite etc .",
    "however , we believe introduction of an emoji sense inventory can open up new research directions on emoji sense disambiguation , emoji similarity analysis , and emoji understanding .",
    "this paper introduces * emojinet * , the first machine readable sense inventory for emoji .",
    "emojinet links emoji represented as unicode with their english language meanings extracted from the web . to achieve this linkage",
    ", emojinet integrates multiple emoji lexicographic resources found on the web along with babelnet  @xcite , a comprehensive machine readable sense inventory for words , to infer sense definitions .",
    "our contributions in this work are threefold :    1 .",
    "we integrate four openly available emoji resources into a single , query - able dictionary of emoji definitions and interpretations ; 2 .",
    "we use word sense disambiguation techniques to assign senses to emoji ; 3 .",
    "we integrate the disambiguated senses in an open web resource , emojinet , which is presently available for systems to query .",
    "the paper also discusses the architecture and construction of emojinet and presents an evaluation of the process to populate its sense inventory .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : rr ] discusses the related literature and frames how this work differs from and furthers existing research .",
    "section [ sec : dc ] discusses our approach and explains the techniques we use to integrate different resources to build emojinet .",
    "section [ sec : eval ] reports on the evaluation of the proposed approach and the evaluation results in detail . section [ sec : con ] offers concluding remarks and plans for future work .",
    "emoji was first introduced in the late 1990s but did not become a unicode standard until 2009  @xcite . following standardization ,",
    "emoji usage experienced major growth in 2011 when the apple iphone added an emoji keyboard to ios , and again in 2013 when the android mobile platform began emoji support  @xcite . in an experiment conducted using 1.6 million tweets , novak _ et al .",
    "_ report that 4% of them contained at least one emoji  @xcite .",
    "their recent popularity explains why research about their use is not as extensive as the research conducted on emoticons  @xcite , which are the predecessor to emoji  @xcite that used to represent facial expression , emotion or to mimic nonverbal cues in verbal speech  @xcite in cmc .",
    "early research on emoji focuses on understanding its role in computer - aided textual communications . from interviews of 20 participants in close personal relationships ,",
    "_ reported that people use emoji to maintain conversational connections in a playful manner  @xcite .",
    "_ studied how emoji compete with emoticons to communicate paralinguistic content on social media  @xcite .",
    "they report that emoji were gaining popularity while emoticons were declining in twitter communications .",
    "studied whether different emoji renderings would give rise to diverse interpretations  @xcite , finding disagreements based on the rendering .",
    "this finding underscores the need for tools to help machines disambiguate the meaning and interpretation of emoji .",
    "the emoji dictionary is a promising web resource for emoji sense disambiguation .",
    "it is a crowdsourced emoji dictionary that provides emoji definitions with user defined sense labels , which are ` word(pos tag ) ` pairs such as ` laugh(noun ) ` .",
    "however , it can not be utilized by a machine for several reasons .",
    "first , it does not list the unicode or short code names for emoji , which are common ways to programmatically identify emoji characters in text .",
    "secondly , it does not list sense definitions and example sentences along with different sense labels for emoji .",
    "typically , when using machine readable dictionaries , machines use such sense definitions and example sentences to generate contextually relevant words for each sense in the dictionary .",
    "thirdly , the reliability of the sense labels is unclear as no validation of the sense labels submitted by the crowd is performed .",
    "with emojinet , we address these limitations by linking the emoji dictionary with other rich emoji resources found on the web .",
    "this allows sense labels to be linked with their unicode and short code name representations and discards human - entered sense labels for emoji that are not agreed upon by the resources .",
    "emojinet also links sense labels with babelnet to provide definitions and example usages for different senses of an emoji .",
    "we formally define emojinet as a collection of octuples representing the senses of an emoji .",
    "let @xmath0 be the set of all emoji in emojinet . for each @xmath1 , emojinet records the octuple @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the unicode representation of @xmath4",
    ", @xmath5 is the short code name of @xmath4 , @xmath6 is a description of @xmath4 , @xmath7 is the set of keywords that describe basic meanings attached to @xmath4 , @xmath8 is the set of images that are used in different rendering platforms such as the iphone and android , @xmath9 is the set of related emoji for @xmath4 , @xmath10 is the set of categories that @xmath4 belongs to , and @xmath11 is the set of different senses in which @xmath4 can be used within a sentence .",
    "an example for an octuple notation is shown as part of figure  [ emojinet ] .",
    "each element in the octuple provides essential information for sense disambiguation .",
    "emojinet uses unicode @xmath3 and short code name @xmath5 of an emoji @xmath1 to uniquely identify @xmath4 , and hence , to search emojinet .",
    "@xmath6 is needed to understand what is represented by the emoji .",
    "it can also help to understand how an emoji should be used .",
    "@xmath7 is essential to understand different human - verified senses that an emoji could be used for .",
    "@xmath8 is needed to understand the rendering differences in each emoji based on different platforms .",
    "images in @xmath8 can also help to conduct similar studies as  @xcite , where the focus is to disambiguate the different representations of the same emoji on different rendering platforms . @xmath9 and @xmath10 could be helpful in tasks such as calculating emoji similarity and emoji sense disambiguation . finally , @xmath11 is the key enabler of emojinet as a tool to support emoji sense disambiguation as @xmath11 holds all sense labels and their definitions for @xmath4 based on crowd and lexicographic knowledge .",
    "next , we describe the open information emojinet extracts and integrates from the web to construct the octuples .",
    "several emoji - related open resources are available on the web , each carrying their own strengths and weaknesses .",
    "some have overlapping information , but none has all of the elements required for a machine readable sense inventory .",
    "thus , emojinet collects information across multiple open resources , linking them together to build the sense inventory .",
    "we describe the resources emojinet utilizes below .",
    "+ * unicode consortium .",
    "* unicode is a text encoding standard enforcing a uniform interpretation of text byte code by computers .",
    "the consortium maintains a complete list of the standardized unicodes for each emoji along with manually curated keywords and images of emoji .",
    "let the set of all emoji available in the unicode emoji list be @xmath12 .",
    "for each emoji @xmath13 , we extract the unicode character @xmath3 of @xmath14 , the set of all images @xmath15 associated with @xmath14 that are used to display @xmath14 on different platforms , and the set of keywords @xmath16 associated with @xmath14 , where @xmath17 is the set of all manually - assigned keywords available for the emoji @xmath14 . +",
    "* emojipedia .",
    "* emojipedia is a human - created emoji reference site .",
    "it provides unicode representations for emoji , images for each emoji based on different rendering platforms , short code names , and other emoji manually - asserted to be related .",
    "emojipedia organizes emoji into a pre - defined set of categories based on how similar the concepts are represented by each emoji , i.e. , smileys & people , animals & nature , or food & drink .",
    "let the set of all emoji available in emojipedia be @xmath18 .",
    "for each emoji @xmath19 , we extract the unicode representation @xmath20 , the short code name @xmath21 , and the emoji definition @xmath22 of @xmath23 , the set of related emoji @xmath24 , and its category set @xmath25 . +",
    "* iemoji is a service tailored toward understanding how emoji are being used in social media posts . for each emoji",

    "the emoji dictionary is a crowdsourced site providing emoji definitions with sense labels based on how they could be used in sentences .",
    "it organizes meanings for emoji under three part - of - speech tags , namely , nouns , verbs , and adjectives .",
    "it also lists an image of the emoji and its definition with example uses spanning multiples sense labels .",
    "let the set of all emoji available in the emoji dictionary be @xmath32 .",
    "for each emoji @xmath33 , we extract its image @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the set of all images of all emoji in @xmath32 and the set of crowd - generated sense labels @xmath36 . + * babelnet * babelnet is the most comprehensive multilingual machine readable semantic network available to date  @xcite .",
    "it is a dictionary with lexicographic and encyclopedic coverage of words tied to a semantic network that connects concepts in wikipedia to the words in the dictionary .",
    "it is built automatically by merging lexicographic data in wordnet with the corresponding encyclopedic knowledge extracted from wikipedia .",
    "babelnet has been shown effective in many research areas including word sense disambiguation  @xcite , semantic similarity , and sense clustering  @xcite .",
    "for the set of all sense labels @xmath36 in each @xmath33 , we extract the sense definitions and examples ( if available ) for each sense label @xmath37 from babelnet .",
    ".emoji data available in open resources [ cols=\"<,>,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      we also provide an illustration of emojinet in action with a disambiguation of the sense of the emoji as it is used in two example tweets .",
    "we choose this emoji since it is reported as one of the most misused emoji on social media .",
    "the tweets we consider are : @xmath38    emojinet lists ` high five(noun ) ` and ` pray(verb ) ` as valid senses for the above emoji . for ` high five(noun ) ` , emojinet lists three definitions and for ` pray(verb ) ` , it lists two definitions .",
    "we take all the words that appear in their corresponding definitions as possible context words that can appear when the corresponding sense is being used in a sentence ( tweet in this case ) . for each sense",
    ", emojinet extracts the following sets of words : @xmath39    to calculate the sense of the emoji in each tweet , we calculate the overlap between the words which appear in the tweet with words appearing with each emoji sense listed above .",
    "this method is called the simplified lesk algorithm  @xcite . the sense with the highest word overlap",
    "is assigned to the emoji at the end of a successful run of the algorithm .",
    "we can see that emoji in @xmath40 will be assigned ` pray(verb ) ` based on the overlap of words \\{god , pray } with words retrieved from the sense definition of ` pray(verb ) ` and the same emoji in @xmath41 will be assigned ` high five(noun ) ` based on the overlap of word \\{celebrate } with words retrieved from the sense definition of ` high five(noun ) ` . in the above example , we have only shown the minimal set of words that one could extract from emojinet .",
    "since we link emojinet senses with their corresponding babelnet senses using babelnet sense ids , one could easily utilize other resources available in babelnet such as related wordnet senses , verbnet senses , wikipedia , etc . to collect an improved set of context words for emoji sense disambiguation tasks .",
    "it should be emphasized that this example was taken only to show the usefulness of the resource for research directions .",
    "this paper presented the construction of emojinet , the first ever machine readable sense inventory to understand the meanings of emoji .",
    "it integrates four different emoji resources from the web to extract emoji senses and align those senses with babelnet .",
    "we evaluated the automatic creation of emojinet by evaluating ( i ) the nearest neighborhood - based image processing algorithm used to align different emoji resources and ( ii ) the most frequent sense - based and the most popular sense - based word sense disambiguation algorithms used to align different emoji senses extracted from the web with babelnet .",
    "we plan to extend our work in the future by expanding the sense definitions extracted from babelnet with words extracted from tweets , using a word embedding model trained on tweets that contain emoji .",
    "we also plan to evaluate the usability of emojinet by first defining the emoji sense disambiguation and emoji similarity finding problems , and then applying emojinet to disambiguate emoji senses based on different contexts in which they appear .",
