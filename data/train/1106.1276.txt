    "one of the basic principle of fluid mechanics is the so - called `` reynolds similarity principle '' : no matter their composition , size , nature , different flow obeying the same equations with the same control parameters will follow the same dynamics .",
    "this principle has been used a lot in engineering to built e.g. prototypes of bridges to be tested in wind tunnels before construction . to obtain easy - to - use prototypes with realistic control parameters ,",
    "one then decreases the size but increases the velocity of the in - flowing wind so as to keep constant the reynolds number , controlling the dynamics of the flow .",
    "this principle could also be of great interest for certain astrophysical flows , whose dynamics could well be approached by simple laboratory flows .",
    "a good example is circum - stellar disk . in @xcite",
    ", it has been shown that under simple , but founded approximations , their equation of motions were similar to the equation of motion of an incompressible rotating shear flow , with penetrable boundary conditions and cylindrical geometry .",
    "this kind of flow can be achieved in the couette - taylor flow , a fluid layer sheared between two coaxial cylinders rotating at different speed , while penetrable boundary conditions can be obtained using porous material . on more general grounds ,",
    "the taylor - couette device is also an excellent prototype to study transport properties of most astrophysical or geophysical rotating shear flows : depending on the rotation speed of each cylinder , one can obtain various flow regimes with increasing or decreasing angular velocity and/or angular momentum .",
    "the taylor - couette flow is a classical example of simple system with complex and rich stability properties , as well as prototype of anisotropic , inhomogeneous turbulence .",
    "it has therefore motivated a great amount of laboratory experiments , and is even the topic of a major international conference .",
    "tagg ( see http://carbon.cudenver.edu/rtagg ) has conducted a bibliography on taylor - couette flow , which gives a good idea of the prototype status of this flow .    here , we make use of the many results obtained so far for the taylor - couette experiment , regarding transition to turbulence , or turbulence properties to propose a practical prescription for the turbulent viscosity as a function of the radial position and the control parameters .",
    "it reads @xmath0 where @xmath1 are the control parameters ( section [ contro ] ) , @xmath2 is the torque measured when only the inner cylinder is rotating ( section [ torque - out ] ) , @xmath3 is a universal function provided in section [ torque - out ] , and @xmath4 is the ratio of the laminar to the mean shear , which encodes all the radial dependence as illustrated in section [ torque - out ] .",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath6 are typical shear and radius of the considered flow .",
    "most of the results we use here have been published elsewhere , except recent experimental results obtained by richard  @xcite .",
    "our work therefore completes and generalizes the approach pioneered by zeldovich  @xcite , with subsequent contributions by  @xcite , in which usually only one aspect of the experiments has been considered .",
    "an application of these findings to circumstellar disks using the reynolds similarity principle can be found in hersant et al .",
    "@xcite thereby providing a physical explanation of several observable indicators of turbulent transport .",
    "the taylor - couette flow is obtained in the gap @xmath7 between two coaxial rotating cylinders of radii @xmath8 , rotating at independent velocities @xmath9 . for the purpose of generality and to allow further comparison with astrophysical flows , the velocity field at the inner cylinder boundary may have a non - zero radial component .",

    "one obtains a taylor - couette flow with radial circulation .",
    "the strength of the radial circulation can be controlled by using more or less porous cylinders  @xcite ) .",
    "[ fig : profile - circ.eps ] provides an example of the influence of the radial circulation on the azimuthal profile .    in practice , even for impermeable cylinders , the flow is not purely azimuthal . because of the finite vertical extent of the apparatus , a large - scale  ekman",
    " circulation is established through the effect of the top and bottom boundaries .",
    "this circulation depends on the ratio of radii and velocities , and on the top and bottom boundary conditions  @xcite .",
    "its signature is easy to detect by profile monitoring , or by measuring the difference between the torque at the inner and outer cylinder  @xcite .",
    "of course this circulation is both radial and vertical and it varies along the cylinders axis .",
    "also its intensity is not easy to control , since it is not fixed externally , but results from a non - trivial equilibrium within the flow .",
    "still , at a given axial position , one may estimate this intensity by a fit of laminar profile using ( [ solutheta ] ) and ( [ clgeneral ] ) . to simplify the exploration of the parameter space",
    ", we shall restrict ourselves to the case of @xmath35 , and study separately the influence of this parameter . in the laboratory , minimizing circulation effect is achieved by working with tall cylinders and consider only a fraction of the flow located at a distance to the top of about 1/3 of the total height , where the radial velocity is expected to be the weakest . specific influence of @xmath33 on stability and transport properties will be considered in section [ stab - rad ] and [ torque - rad ] .",

[ controltc ]    the above control parameters have been introduced so that their definition apply to rotating shear flows in general and not only to the taylor - couette geometry .",
    "it is very easy in this formulation to relate the taylor - couette flow to the plane couette flow with rotation , by simply considering the limit @xmath51 .",
    "also , in the astrophysical context , one often considers asymptotic angular velocity profiles of the form @xmath52 where @xmath53 then fully characterizes the flow . in that case",
    "@xmath54 , which is a simple relation to situate astrophysical profiles in the control parameters space of the taylor - couette flows . from the hydrodynamic viewpoint ,",
    "an important characteristic of the flow profile is the sign of the shear compared to the sign of the angular velocity , which defines cyclonic and anticylonic flows .",
    "for the co - rotating laminar taylor - couette flow , the sign of the local ratio @xmath55 is constant across the whole flow and is thus simply given by the sign of the rotation number ( @xmath56 for cyclonic flows and @xmath57 for anticylonic flows ) . finally let us recall that an analogy exist between taylor - couette and rayleigh - bnard convection ( see  @xcite for details and  @xcite for a review ) , which calls for an even larger generalization of the control parameters definition .",

    "the linear stability properties of the flow are governed by the rayleigh criterion .",
    "the fluid is stable if the rayleigh discriminant is everywhere positive : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the specific angular momentum . applying this criterion to the laminar profile leads to @xmath62    since @xmath63 varies between @xmath64 and @xmath65 , one obtains that in the inviscid limit , the flow is unstable against infinitesimal axisymmetric disturbances when @xmath66 , where @xmath67 , respectively @xmath68 , are the marginal stability thresholds in the inviscid limit ( superscript @xmath69 ) in the cyclonic case ( @xmath70 , subscript @xmath71 ) , respectively anticyclonic case ( @xmath72 , subscript @xmath73 ) .",
    "these rayleigh limits are also displayed on figure  [ fig : param ] , where they have to be seen as asymptotic . as a matter of fact",
    ", this information is rather poor :    * non - axisymmetric disturbances can be more destabilizing than axisymetric ones , so that the flow could be linearly unstable in part of the linearly stable domain ; * viscous damping will probably reduce the linearly unstable domain ; * finally , finite amplitude disturbances may seriously reduce the stable domain .    in the following , assuming that the axisymmetric disturbances are indeed the most dangerous one at the linear level  which",
    "up to now is validated both experimentally and numerically  , we will consider the two last items .",
    "on one side , we will review the existing results on the effect of viscosity in the supercritical case , which will provide us with a critical reynolds number as a function of the other parameters @xmath74 . on the other side",

    "torque measurements have been traditionally used in the past  @xcite .",
    "their advantage is their accuracy and their flexibility to detect other transition at larger reynolds numbers .",
    "their inconvenience is their difficulty of implementation in the case where both cylinders are rotating .",

    "moreover , these data indicate that at large reynolds number , the function @xmath293 becomes independent of @xmath41 .",
    "note also that according to this model , we should have @xmath294 . at @xmath295 , @xmath83 , the data of wendt",
    "provide a value of @xmath207 for this ratio , in good agreement with the value observed by coles and van atta , see fig .",
    "[ fig : rad - torque.eps ] . in this model , the total torque is zero ( conservation of total angular momentum ) only when considering the torque applied by the circulation on the top and the bottom boundary .",
    "this means that in the presence of a radial circulation , a non - negligible torque is likely to apply at the vertical boundary .",
    "this observation may be relevant to astrophysical disks , and jet - like phenomena .",
    "the influence of a constant vertical magnetic field on the torque has been studied by donnelly and ozima  @xcite .",
    "the measurements have been performed in the linear instability regime , with outer cylinder at rest .",
    "it is observed that an increasing magnetic field reduces the torque , so as to conserve the @xmath296 scaling observed at zero magnetic field ( section [ torque - super ] ) .",
    "the torque reduction is thus a function only of a non - dimensional magnetic field , and of @xmath65 .",

    "it seems to follow a simple law : @xmath311 where @xmath312 and @xmath313 are functions of the gap size .",
    "physically , this torque reduction may be due to the elongation of the cellular vortices which occurs as the magnetic field is increased  @xcite .",
    "mathematically , the reduction can be understood using the connection between torque and critical number . in this framework",
    ", chandrasekhar  @xcite observes that the addition of a magnetic field onto a flow heated from below imparts to the liquid an effective kinematic viscosity @xmath314 .",
    "only the component of the field parallel to the gravity vector is effective .",
    "this makes the critical reynolds number for stability proportional to @xmath315 . using the relation between the torque and the critical reynolds number in the linearly unstable regime ( eqs .",
    "( [ torquelinear ] ) and ( [ relationslinear ] ) ) , this leads to the scaling ( [ reducmag ] ) .",
    "the turbulent viscosity in the direction perpendicular to the shear @xmath316 can be estimated via the mean torque @xmath317 applied by the fluid to the rotating cylinders and the mean turbulent velocity profile .",
    "indeed , this torque induces a stress equal to : @xmath318 where @xmath15 is the area of a cylindrical fluid element at radius r , @xmath10 is the fluid density , and @xmath319 is the mean azimuthal viscosity .",
    "since a similar formula applies in the laminar case , with @xmath320 , one simply gets : @xmath321 using the expression of @xmath41 , @xmath322 and @xmath323 ( [ torquelam ] ) , we thus get the simple expression : @xmath324 here , we have adopted the notation of richard and zahn  @xcite to express the turbulent viscosity in unit of the typical shear and radius of the flow as @xmath325 .",
    "this non - dimensional parameter encompasses all the interesting variation of the turbulent viscosity as a function of the radial position @xmath14 and the control parameters @xmath41 , @xmath322 ( or @xmath65 ) and @xmath42 . the radial variation",
    "is given through the ratio @xmath4 as illustrated in section [ mean - sub ] .",
    "this ratio is one near the boundary and may increase in the core of the flow , due to the turbulent shear reduction .",
    "all the variation with @xmath42 is through the function @xmath326 which has been empirically determined in section [ torque - out ] and plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : relative - torque ] .",
    "all the variation with @xmath41 is through @xmath327 , which can be determined through torque measurements ( sections [ torque - super ] and [ torque - sub ] ) , with a theoretical expression provided in section [ torque - out ] for smooth boundaries , and [ torque - ext ] for rough boundaries .",
    "the dependence on the curvature is subtler since it appears in all the above dependencies .",
    "an example of variation of the dimensionless turbulent viscosity @xmath325 for @xmath328 is provided in fig .",
    "[ fig : turb - visc ] for smooth and rough boundary conditions .",
    "one sees that at large enough reynolds number , this function becomes independent of the reynolds number for rough boundary conditions , while it decreases steadily in the smooth boundary cases , due to logarithmic corrections .",
    "this weak reynolds number variation is in contrast with standard turbulent viscosity prescription , based on dimensional consideration _  la kolmogorov_.    , @xmath86 , data from van den berg et al .. the continuous line is drawn using formula ( [ torquerough ] ) .",

    "the dotted and the dashed - dot lines are drawn using formulae ( [ modeldh ] ) . , width=283 ]    finally ,",
    "let us compare our results with previous results for the turbulent viscosity in rotating flows . using a turbulent closure model of turbulence ,",
    "dubrulle  @xcite derived @xmath329 .",
    "this formula reflects the correct behavior in term of @xmath42 ( see section [ torque - thres ] ) but fails to reproduce the reynolds dependence in the case of smooth boundary conditions . for rough boundary conditions ,",
    "our formula predicts a turbulent viscosity going like @xmath330 for @xmath331 and @xmath332 for @xmath333 , in the wide gap limit .",
    "the formula of dubrulle is therefore in between these two predictions .",
    "richard and zahn  @xcite used taylor measurements  @xcite to derive the value @xmath334 .",
    "these measurements are performed for @xmath335 , with inner cylinder at rest . at @xmath113 ,",
    "one has @xmath336 and from fig .",
    "[ fig : relative - torque ] , @xmath337 . for @xmath4",
    "we adopt a value equal to @xmath338 , as suggested by section [ mean - sub ] . finally , from fig .",
    "[ fig : turb - visc ] , we get @xmath339 so that we finally obtain @xmath340 , an estimate close to the one proposed by richard and zahn .",
    "the present work provides us with a prescription for the turbulent viscosity hence the turbulent transport for the taylor - couette flow .",
    "this prediction clearly indicates the dependencies on the reynolds number and the rotation number .",
    "the curvature effect is much trickier to isolate at least with the available data , since it appears in all the terms of the prescription .",
    "especially , on the cyclonic side , where the rayleigh criterion depends on the curvature , it is impossible without any phenomenological arguments to isolate the curvature effect from the rotation one within the set of data used here . since we wanted to remain as close as possible to the existing data , we decided not to reproduce any phenomenological arguments in the present paper ( for such an analysis see e.g. longaretti and dauchot  @xcite ) .",
    "the introduction of new control parameters , which rely on the dynamical properties of the flow , rather than on its geometry allows us to envision some application of our result to rotating shear flows in general even if one should remain cautious with the details of the boundary conditions .",
    "these new control parameters have a rather general ground , but they remain global quantities .",
    "it would be interesting to further develop this approach , by introducing local dynamical control parameters , so that in spatially developing flows , one could conduct a local study of the stability properties .    in order to validate the above prescription",
    ", it would definitely be necessary to confront it to more experimental data .",
    "on the anticyclonic side , in the subcritical regime , only one value of the curvature has been investigated , so that we have very little idea of its influence . in the supercritical regime ,",
    "an important hypothesis made here was to introduce @xmath257 and to relate it to @xmath242 and @xmath78 .",
    "also , we have proposed to relate the torque measurements ( a difficult experimental task ) to the threshold determination .",
    "these conjectures should be checked against more data .",
    "finally , we have tried to provide some indications on the influence of external effects such as stratification , or magnetic fields .",
    "clearly the lack of experimental data here is such that very little could be done and a definitive effort should be conducted in this direction .    still , it is to our knowledge the first time that using most of the existing experimental studies a practical prescription for the turbulent viscosity is proposed",
    ". it can certainly be improved , but we believe that , even at the present level , it can already bring much insight into the understanding of some astrophysical and geophysical flows .",
