    "filtergrams taken in the g - band around 430.5  nm are often used for proxy magnetometry since photospheric bright points associated with magnetic structures show up very well in them ( e.g.  berger et al .  1995 ) .",
    "we have performed lte spectrum synthesis of the g band ( mostly formed by ch ) using the semi - empirical magnetic flux - tube model nchrom7 of briand & solanki ( 1995 ) which is a refinement of the models of bruls & solanki ( 1993 ) and solanki ( 1986 ) .",
    "it is embedded in a standard model for the quiet photosphere .",
    "figure  1 shows results .",
    "the hot bright walls of the ( rotationally symmetric ) flux tube create a bright ring seen as a double peak in the radiation temperature .",
    "figure  1 also shows the temperature structure along three lines of sight : through quiet sun , through the tube centre , and through the tube wall where the emergent intensity peaks considerably because it samples the quiet - sun model at larger depth than the quiet - sun line of sight does . the peak contrast with respect to the quiet sun is larger in @xmath0 than in @xmath1 mainly because the photosphere appears darker in the g band .",
    "detailed inspection of the synthetic spectra shows how most spectral lines weaken in the flux tube .",
    "we interpret this as due to the shallower temperature gradient and the lower density inside the flux tube .",
    "molecular lines weaken the most due to the pressure dependence of the molecular association equilibria .",
    "this is the reason that bright points should show up particularly well in molecular lines .",
    "the resulting intensity spectra were integrated using the transmission profiles of two filters that have been used at the swedish vacuum solar telescope ( svst ) on la palma , denoted @xmath0 for the g band and @xmath1 for a nearby continuum band .",
    "the results were compared to a pair of @xmath0 and @xmath1 images of a solar active region taken with the svst by berger & lfdahl ( private communication ) and restored by them using the phase - diversity technique ( cf .",
    "lfdahl et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "figure  2 compares the contrast values of the two passbands ",
    "i.e.  the spectrally integrated intensity ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) normalised to the quiet sun intensity ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 )  with the observations .",
    "the points and contours represent the @xmath0 and @xmath1 contrasts measured per pixel in the svst images .",
    "the stars represent peak intensities from the flux tube model after convolution with a range of smearing functions that simulate degradation by atmospheric seeing and by the telescope .",
    "the resulting peak contrast is very sensitive to the far wings of the smearing profile  which are very difficult to assess .",
    "nevertheless , the comparison indicates reasonable agreement between the computed peak contrasts and the highest observed contrasts .",
    "could there be other spectral regions useful for proxy magnetometry or flux - tube diagnostics ?",
    "we synthesised also a wide range of the solar spectrum with spectral resolution @xmath4 .",
    "the upper panel of fig .",
    "3 shows smoothed spectra along the three lines of sight indicated at left in fig .  1 .",
    "the lower panel shows the wall / quiet - sun contrast .",
    "the balmer lines stand out because they get stronger due to the high temperature of the flux - tube walls .",
    "the balmer jump does not strengthen , however , so that feature is probably not a good flux - tube diagnostic .",
    "the violet cn band produces large contrast in the lower panel of fig .  3 and",
    "is known to display the photospheric network well ( chapman 1970 ) .",
    "inspection of the computed molecular equilibria shows that cn is depleted to a smaller fraction in the flux tube than ch .",
    "preliminary results from the svst received during the symposium ( rouppe van der voort , private communication ) confirm indeed that cn bright points look very similar to those seen in the g band .",
    "the briand & solanki model produces bright - point contrasts similar to those observed at the svst .",
    "however , the spectrum synthesis was made assuming lte and the photospheric part of the flux tube model was primarily constructed from lte inversions of spectropolarimetric data .",
    "do we believe these lte assumptions ? not necessarily",
    ". a contrasting scenario would be one where uv radiation from the hot walls photodissociates ch in the flux tube and also causes overionisation of metals , thus affecting our g - band synthesis as well as the semi - empirical modelling .",
    "if there is any place in the solar photosphere where 3d  nlte effects are important , it should be in these flux tubes .",
