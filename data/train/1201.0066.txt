    "there is a large body of work about representing planar graphs as contact graphs , i.e. , graphs whose vertices are represented by geometrical objects with edges corresponding to two objects touching in some specified fashion .",
    "typical classes of objects might be curves , line segments , or polygons .",
    "an early result is koebe s 1936 theorem  @xcite that all planar graphs can be represented by touching disks .    in this paper",
    ", we consider contact representations of planar graphs , with vertices represented by simple interior - disjoint polygons and adjacencies represented by a non - trivial contact ( shared boundary ) between the corresponding polygons .",
    "we are specifically interested in the rectilinear weighted version where the vertices are represented by simple ( axis - aligned ) rectilinear polygons .",
    "this type of a representation is known as a _ rectilinear dual _ of the input planar graph .    in the weighted version ,",
    "the input is a planar graph @xmath0 along with a weight function @xmath1 that assigns a weight to each vertex of @xmath2 .",
    "a rectilinear dual is called a _ cartogram _ if the area of each region is equal to the pre - specified weight of the corresponding vertex .",
    "such representations have practical applications in cartography  @xcite , geography  @xcite and sociology  @xcite , but also in vlsi layout and floor - planning  @xcite .",
    "other applications can be found in visualization of relational data , where using the adjacency of regions to represent edges in a graph can lead to a more compelling visualization than just drawing a line segment between two points  @xcite .    for rectilinear duals ( unweighted ) and for cartograms ( weighted )",
    "it is often desirable , for aesthetic , practical and cognitive reasons , to limit the _ polygonal complexity _ of the representation , measured by the number of sides ( or by the number of corners ) .",
    "similarly , it is also desirable to minimize the unused area in the representation , also known as _",
    "holes _ in floor - planning and vlsi layouts .",
    "a given rectilinear dual is _ area - universal _ if it can realize a cartogram with any pre - specified set of weights for the vertices of the graph without disturbing the underlying adjacencies and without increasing the polygonal complexity .    with these considerations in mind",
    ", we study the problem of constructing area - universal rectilinear duals and show how to compute cartograms with worst - case optimal polygonal complexity and without any holes .      in our paper and in most of the other papers cited here ,",
    "`` planar graph '' refers to an inner - triangulated planar graph with a simple outer - face ; the former restriction is required if at most three rectilinear polygons are allowed to meet in a point and the latter restriction is customary to achieve that the union of all the polygons in the representation is a rectangle .",
    "rectilinear duals ( unweighted ) were first studied in graph theoretic context , and then with renewed interest in the context of vlsi layouts and floor planning .",
    "it is known that @xmath3 sides are sometimes necessary and always sufficient  @xcite .",
    "the case when the rectilinear polygons are restricted to rectangles has been of particular interest and there are several ( independent ) characterizations of the class of planar graphs that allows such _ rectangular duals _",
    "a historical overview and a summary of the state of the art in the rectangle contact graphs literature can be found in buchsbaum _",
    "_  @xcite .    in the above results on rectilinear duals and rectangular duals ,",
    "the areas of the polygons are not considered ; that is , these results deal with the unweighted version of the problem .",
    "the weighted version dates back to 1934 when raisz described rectangular cartograms  @xcite .",
    "algorithms by van kreveld and speckmann  @xcite and heilmann _ et al . _",
    "@xcite yield representations with touching rectangles but the adjacencies may be disturbed and there may also be a small distortions of the weights .",
    "recently , eppstein _ et al . _",
    "@xcite characterized the class of planar graphs that have area - universal rectangular duals .",
    "the construction of the actual cartogram , given the area - universal rectilinear dual and the weight function , can be accomplished using a result by wimer _",
    "@xcite , which in turn requires numerical iteration .",
    "the result of eppstein _ et al .",
    "_ above is restricted to planar graphs that have rectangular duals .",
    "going back to the more general rectilinear duals , leads to a series of papers where the main goal has been to reduce the polygonal complexity while respecting all areas and adjacencies .",
    "de berg  _ et al .",
    "_ initially showed that 40 sides suffice  @xcite .",
    "this was later improved to @xmath4 sides  @xcite . in a recent paper  @xcite the polygonal complexity",
    "was reduced to 12 sides and even more recently to 10 sides  @xcite .",
    "side contact representations of planar graphs have also been studied without the restriction to rectilinear polygons . in the unweighted case 6-sided",
    "polygons are sometimes necessary and always sufficient  @xcite .",
    "the constructive upper bound relies on convex 6-sided polygons . in the weighted version , where the area of each polygon is prescribed",
    ", examples are known for which polygons with 7  sides are necessary  @xcite . this lower bound is matched by constructive upper bound of 7  sides if holes are allowed  @xcite . in the same paper",
    "it is shown that even allowing arbitrarily high polygonal complexity and holes of arbitrary size , there exist examples with prescribed areas which can not be represented with convex polygons . if holes are not allowed then the best previously known polygonal complexity is  10 , and it is achieved with rectilinear polygons  @xcite .",
    "recall that the known lower bound on the polygonal complexity even for unweighted rectilinear duals is 8 while the best known upper bound is 10 . here",
    "we present the first construction that matches the lower bound .",
    "specifically , our construction produces 8-sided area - universal rectilinear duals in linear time , and is thus optimal in terms of polygonal complexity .",
    "the exact cartogram can be computed from the area - universal rectangular layout with numerical iteration , or can be approximated with a hill - climbing heuristic .    for hamiltonian maximal planar graphs we have an alternative construction which allows us to directly compute cartograms with 8-sided rectilinear polygons in linear time .",
    "moreover , we prove that 8-sided rectilinear polygons are necessary by constructing a non - trivial lower bound example .",
    "if the hamiltonian path has the extra property that it is one - legged , then we can reduce the polygonal complexity and realize cartograms with 6-sided polygons .",
    "this can be used to obtain 6-sided cartograms of maximal outer - planar graphs .",
    "thus we have optimal ( in terms of both polygonal complexity and running time ) representations for hamiltonian maximal planar and maximal outer - planar graphs .",

    "a rectilinear dual is called a _ cartogram _ if the area of each polygon is equal to the pre - specified weight of the corresponding vertex .",
    "we define the _ complexity of a polygon _ as the number of sides it has .",
    "a common objective is to realize a given graph and a set of weights , using polygons with minimal complexity .",
    "next we briefly summarize the concepts of a `` canonical order '' of a planar graph  @xcite and that of a `` schnyder realizer ''  @xcite .",

    "<S> in a rectilinear dual of a planar graph vertices are represented by simple rectilinear polygons and edges are represented by side - contact between the corresponding polygons . </S>",
    "<S> a rectilinear dual is called a cartogram if the area of each region is equal to a pre - specified weight of the corresponding vertex . </S>",
    "<S> the complexity of a cartogram is determined by the maximum number of corners ( or sides ) required for any polygon . in a series of papers </S>",
    "<S> the polygonal complexity of such representations for maximal planar graphs has been reduced from the initial 40 to 34 , then to 12 and very recently to the currently best known 10 . here </S>",
    "<S> we describe a construction with 8-sided polygons , which is optimal in terms of polygonal complexity as 8-sided polygons are sometimes necessary . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we show how to compute the combinatorial structure and how to refine the representation into an area - universal rectangular layout in linear time . </S>",
    "<S> the exact cartogram can be computed from the area - universal rectangular layout with numerical iteration , or can be approximated with a hill - climbing heuristic .    </S>",
    "<S> we also describe an alternative construction for hamiltonian maximal planar graphs , which allows us to directly compute the cartograms in linear time . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we prove that even for hamiltonian graphs 8-sided rectilinear polygons are necessary , by constructing a non - trivial lower bound example . </S>",
    "<S> the complexity of the cartograms can be reduced to 6 if the hamiltonian path has the extra property that it is one - legged , as in outer - planar graphs . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we have optimal representations ( in terms of both polygonal complexity and running time ) for hamiltonian maximal planar and maximal outer - planar graphs . </S>"
