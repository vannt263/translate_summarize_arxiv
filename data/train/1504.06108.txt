    "all experimental measurements benefit from larger data sets , since statistical uncertainties diminish .",
    "some measurements are ultimately limited by backgrounds or by systematic uncertainties , but additional data can help to reduce these , or provide alternative and independent measurements .",
    "for example , multipurpose experiments such as those carried out at particle colliders ( from the @xmath0 factories up to the highest energy hadron colliders ) explore a broad spectrum of available observables , including those that have very small rates that will continue to benefit as data sets increase .",
    "nevertheless , practical , technical , and financial considerations limit the integrated luminosity that an accelerator will ultimately be able to deliver , so it is important both to aim high and to anticipate what the minimum luminosity must be to guarantee significant new results .",
    "the measurement of specific processes can be used to define such minimal goals .",
    "this is a well - posed problem in the case of measurements of known processes , where the goal is , for example , a given precision . in the case of searches for new phenomena ,",
    "things are less clear .",
    "the searches for the top quark and the higgs boson , whose mass ranges and properties were well defined , set reliable luminosity requirements that were used in setting the accelerator specifications of the tevatron , of its run 2 upgrade , and of the large hadron collider . but",
    "after the higgs discovery , we lack a well - defined direction for the appearance of new physics phenomena that can be guaranteed ( or at least anticipated with a high degree of confidence ) .",
    "discoveries in run 2 of the lhc and beyond could change this situation .",
    "the absence of a clear target leads , for now , to large uncertainties in the definition of discovery - driven parameters of future colliders .",
    "this is true both of possible discoveries at the highest mass reach and of discoveries that might result if deviations from the standard model were seen in precision studies of electroweak observables , or of higgs decays . in both cases",
    "one should simply aim at the most aggressive possible performance ( in energy and luminosity ) allowed by the balance of technological challenge and costs and then assess the impact of such measurements",
    ". the impact must be large enough to both motivate the experimental community to participate and justify the cost of undertaking a major new project .",
    "as the high energy physics community starts discussing scenarios for future hadron colliders in the energy range of @xmath1  @xcite , it is natural to ask what the appropriate luminosity goals should be .",
    "a generic argument , based on the scaling properties of cross sections as a function of the partonic center - of - mass energy suggests that in order for the increase in discovery reach to match the increase in collider energy , @xmath2 , the luminosity should scale as @xmath3 , the square of the center of mass energy  @xcite . scaling violations in the partonic densities can be used to support an argument for even faster luminosity growth  @xcite .",
    "this scaling argument has the virtue of simplicity , but the conclusions are sensitive to the choice of starting parameters .",
    "it is worth recalling that , because of the fixed size of the lep tunnel , the lhc compensated for constrained energy by setting aggressive luminosity goals . in different circumstances , the energy ",
    "luminosity optimization might take a different path .    in this note",
    ", we consider from a broader perspective the physics opportunities that a 100-tev hadron collider should address , among them , extending the mass reach for discovery .",
    "specifically , we examine several physics cases that drive the luminosity goals . in the context set by those goals ,",
    "we ask how high a luminosity is desirable and whether we can reasonably set a minimum acceptable luminosity  @xcite .",
    "we set as a first requirement that _ the initial luminosity of a new hadron collider should be sufficiently high to surpass the exploration potential of the lhc very quickly , _ certainly within the first year of operation .",
    "we consider the luminosity demands of four areas of investigation .    1",
    ".   the search for new phenomena , inaccessible to the lhc , at high mass scales ; 2 .   increased sensitivity to rare or high - background processes at mass scales well below the kinematical limit of the 100 tev collider ; 3 .   increased precision for studies of new particles within the ultimate discovery reach of the lhc ; 4 .",
    "incisive studies of the higgs boson , both in the domain of precision , and in the exploration of new phenomena .",
    "we consider , as a first example , the case of a possible sequential @xmath4 boson , a massive electroweak gauge boson with couplings identical to those of the standard - model @xmath5 boson .",
    "the production proceeds via quark anti - quark annihilation ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "setting the discovery threshold at 100 total produced @xmath4 bosons ( leading to @xmath7 events in the clean and background - free leptonic final states with electrons and muons ) gives the luminosity requirements displayed in the left plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : wreach ] , as a function of the @xmath4 mass @xmath8 .",
    "cross sections are calculated at lo , using the pdf sets cteq6.6  @xcite and scale @xmath9 . ] in the luminosity range of 0.110@xmath10  , the increase in mass reach is well approximated by a logarithmic behaviour , with a @xmath11 7  increase in mass for a tenfold luminosity increase : @xmath12 ( a simple argument for this scaling relation is given in appendix a ) .",
    "the relative gain in mass reach therefore diminishes as the total luminosity is increased , as shown in the right plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : wreach ] .",
    "this displays the relative extension in mass reach achieved with a factor of 10 increase in luminosity . for example , if for a given integrated luminosity @xmath13 we are sensitive to a mass @xmath14  tev , @xmath15 will give sensitivity to a mass a factor of @xmath16 times larger , namely 28  tev . the additional sensitivity gain given by a factor of 10 increase in luminosity",
    "drops below 20% at around 40  , the discovery reach corresponding to about 10  ( see the left plot of fig .  [",
    "fig : wreach ] ) .",
    "the conclusion is that higher luminosity is of greater benefit in the exploration of lower , rather than higher , masses . to illustrate the interplay between collider energy and luminosity",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : wenergy ] how cross sections increase as the c.m .",
    "energy is raised above @xmath17  tev . for a mass of 40  tev ,",
    "an increase in energy from 100  tev to 130  tev would be equivalent to a factor of 10 increase in luminosity at @xmath17  tev .",
    "qualitatively similar conclusions can be reached considering processes dominated by a @xmath18 initial state , rather than @xmath19 .",
    "the pair - production of massive color - triplet quarks and squarks , and of gluino - like states , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qqreach ] . as exhaustive list of additional examples",
    "is given in ref .",
    "@xcite .    .",
    "projected sensitivity , at @xmath20  , for the exclusion and discovery of a @xmath21 gauge boson with standard - model couplings .",
    "[ tab : zprime ] [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the case of single higgs production , detailed studies of the actual precision reach are lacking , and it is not possible at this time to anticipate the luminosity values at which systematic uncertainties will start to dominate .",
    "preliminary studies  @xcite are however available for @xmath22 pair production , which will still be very poorly probed after completion of the hl - lhc program .",
    "a prime goal of @xmath22 studies is to extract the higgs - boson self - coupling with a precision of 5% of the standard - model expectation .",
    "the preliminary studies suggest that this goal can be reached with 30  , through the measurement of the cross section for higgs pairs in the channel @xmath23 .",
    "experience shows that no collider ever starts at the ultimate luminosity .",
    "it is interesting , therefore , to evaluate what minimum luminosity threshold opens the door on possible discoveries at 100 tev .    if we consider dijet production as a probe of the shortest distances , we can extract a reference luminosity target from fig .  [",
    "fig : dijets ] , which shows the leading - order cross section to produce central dijet pairs as a function of their invariant mass .",
    "the lhc has a sensitivity at the level of 1 event per  for dijet masses above @xmath24  tev . at this mass ,",
    "the 100 tev cross section is 6 orders of magnitude larger , which means that the hl - lhc sensitivity can be recovered within 1  , i.e. , in less than a day of running at a luminosity of @xmath25  .",
    "the sensitivity to a mass range twice as large , 19  tev , would require 50  , namely of the order of one month at @xmath25  , and one year of running at this luminosity would give us events with dijet mass well above 25  tev .    if we consider particles just outside the possible discovery reach of the hl - lhc , which therefore the lhc could not have discovered , we find rate increases in the range of @xmath26@xmath27 that we discussed earlier , for @xmath6 and @xmath18 production channels , respectively .",
    "this means that integrated luminosities in the range of 0.11  are sufficient to push the discovery reach beyond what the hl - lhc has already explored .",
    "this can be obtained with initial luminosities as small as @xmath28  .    finally , we project in fig .",
    "[ fig : massreach_profile ] the temporal evolution of the expansion of discovery reach for various luminosity scenarios , relative to the reach of 3  at 14 tev .",
    "the left ( right ) plot shows results for a resonance whose couplings allow discovery at hl - lhc up to 6  tev ( 1  tev ) .",
    "once again , we notice that the benefit of luminosity is more prominent at low mass than at high mass .",
    "we also notice that , considering the multi - year span of the programme , and assuming a progressive increase of the luminosity integrated in a year , an early start at low luminosity does not impact significantly the ultimate reach after a fixed number of years .",
    "these results are not an argument for modest luminosity as an ultimate goal , but a reminder of the advantages of high collider energy .",
    "should specific very - high - mass targets arise , the overall optimization of energy and luminosity need not be restricted to a single parameter .",
    "the goal of an integrated luminosity in the range of 10 - 20  per experiment , corresponding to an ultimate instantaneous luminosity approaching @xmath29  @xcite , seems well - matched to our current perspective on extending the discovery reach for new phenomena at high mass scales , high - statistics studies of possible new physics to be discovered at ( hl)-lhc , and incisive studies of the higgs boson s properties .",
    "specific measurements may set more aggressive luminosity goals , but we have not found generic arguments to justify them .",
    "the needs of precision physics arising from new physics scenarios to be discovered at the hl - lhc , to be suggested by anomalies observed during the @xmath30 phase of a future circular collider , or to be discovered at 100  tev , may well drive the need for even higher statistics .",
    "such requirements will need to be established on a case - by - case basis , and no general scaling law gives a robust extrapolation from 14 tev .",
    "further work on _ ad hoc _ scenarios , particularly for low - mass phenomena and elusive signatures , is therefore desirable .    for a large class of new - physics scenarios that may arise from the lhc , less aggressive luminosity goals are acceptable as a compromise between physics return and technical or experimental challenges",
    ". in particular , even luminosities in the range of @xmath25  are enough to greatly extend the discovery reach of the 100  tev collider over that of the hl - lhc , or to enhance the precision in the measurement of discoveries made at the hl - lhc .",

    "however , this slow gain with luminosity also means that one would not lose too much mass reach by going to a much lower luminosity . as demonstrated here , this is ultimately due to the fact that the parton luminosity is steeply falling , in particular near the edge of the kinematical reach of a collider .",
