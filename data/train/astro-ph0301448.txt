    "cosmology is undergoing an explosive burst of activity , fueled both by new , accurate astrophysical data and by innovative theoretical developments .",
    "cosmological parameters such as the total density of the universe and the rate of cosmological expansion are being precisely measured for the first time , and a consistent standard picture of the universe is beginning to emerge .",
    "this is exciting , but why talk about astrophysics at a school for particle physicists ?",
    "the answer is that over the past twenty years or so , it has become evident that the the story of the universe is really a story of fundamental physics .",
    "i will argue that not only should particle physicists care about cosmology , but you should care _ a lot_. recent developments in cosmology indicate that it will be possible to use astrophysics to perform tests of fundamental theory inaccessible to particle accelerators , namely the physics of the vacuum itself .",
    "this has proven to be a surprise to cosmologists : the old picture of a universe filled only with matter and light have given way to a picture of a universe whose history is largely written in terms of the quantum - mechanical properties of empty space .",
    "it is currently believed that the universe today is dominated by the energy of vacuum , about 70% by weight . in addition",
    ", the idea of inflation postulates that the universe at the earliest times in its history was also dominated by vacuum energy , which introduces the intriguing possibility that all structure in the universe , from superclusters to planets , had a quantum - mechanical origin in the earliest moments of the universe .",
    "furthermore , these ideas are not idle theorizing , but are predictive and subject to meaningful experimental test .",
    "cosmological observations are providing several surprising challenges to fundamental theory .",
    "these lectures are organized as follows .",
    "section [ secintro ] provides an introduction to basic cosmology and a description of the surprising recent discovery of the accelerating universe .",
    "section [ seccmb ] discusses the physics of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , one of the most useful observational tools in modern cosmology .",
    "section [ secinflation ] discusses some unresolved problems in standard big - bang cosmology , and introduces the idea of inflation as a solution to those problems .",
    "section [ sectransplanck ] discusses the intriguing ( and somewhat speculative ) idea of using inflation as a `` microscope '' to illuminate physics at the very highest energy scales , where effects from quantum gravity are likely to be important .",
    "these lectures are geared toward graduate students who are familiar with special relativity and quantum mechanics , and who have at least been introduced to general relativity and quantum field theory .",
    "there are many things i will not talk about , such as dark matter and structure formation , which are interesting but do not touch directly on the main theme of the `` physics of nothing . ''",
    "i omit many details , but i provide references to texts and review articles where possible .",
    "all of modern cosmology stems essentially from an application of the copernican principle : we are not at the center of the universe . in fact , today we take copernicus idea one step further and assert the `` cosmological principle '' : _ nobody _ is at the center of the universe .",
    "the cosmos , viewed from any point , looks the same as when viewed from any other point .",
    "this , like other symmetry principles more directly familiar to particle physicists , turns out to be an immensely powerful idea . in particular",
    ", it leads to the apparently inescapable conclusion that the universe has a finite age .",
    "there was a beginning of time .",
    "we wish to express the cosmological principle mathematically , as a symmetry . to do this , and to understand the rest of these lectures ,",
    "we need to talk about metric tensors and general relativity , at least briefly .",
    "metric _ on a space is simply a generalization of pythagoras theorem for the distance @xmath0 between two points separated by distances @xmath1 , @xmath2 we can write this as a matrix equation , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is just the unit matrix , @xmath5 the matrix @xmath4 is referred to as the _ metric _ of the space , in this case a three - dimensional euclidean space .",
    "one can define other , non - euclidean spaces by specifying a different metric .",
    "a familiar one is the four - dimensional `` minkowski '' space of special relativity , where the proper distance between two points in spacetime is given by @xmath6 corresponding to a metric tensor with indices @xmath7 : @xmath8 in a minkowski space , photons travel on null paths , or _ geodesics _ ,",
    "@xmath9 , and massive particles travel on _ timelike _ geodesics , @xmath10 .",
    "note that in both of the examples given above , the metric is time - independent , describing a static space . in general relativity , the metric becomes a dynamic object , and can in general depend on time and space .",
    "the fundamental equation of general relativity is the einstein field equation , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a _ stress energy _ tensor describing the distribution of mass in space , g is newton s gravitational constant and the einstein tensor @xmath13 is a complicated function of the metric and its first and second derivatives .",
    "this should be familiar to anyone who has taken a course in electromagnetism , since we can write maxwell s equations in matrix form as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the field tensor and @xmath16 is the current .",
    "here we use the standard convention that we sum over the repeated indices of four - dimensional spacetime @xmath17 . note the similarity between eq .",
    "( [ eqefe ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eqmax ] ) . the similarity is more than formal :",
    "both have a charge on the right hand side acting as a source for a field on the left hand side . in the case of maxwell s equations ,",
    "the source is electric charge and the field is the electromagnetic field . in the case of einstein s equations ,",
    "the source is mass / energy , and the field is the shape of the spacetime , or the metric .",
    "an additional feature of the einstein field equation is that it is _ much _ more complicated than maxwell s equations : eq .",
    "( [ eqefe ] ) represents six independent nonlinear partial differential equations of ten functions , the components of the ( symmetric ) metric tensor @xmath18 .",
    "( the other four degrees of freedom are accounted for by invariance under transformations among the four coordinates . )    clearly , finding a general solution to a set of equations as complex as the einstein field equations is a hopeless task .",
    "therefore , we do what any good physicist does when faced with an impossible problem : we introduce a symmetry to make the problem simpler .",
    "the three simplest symmetries we can apply to the einstein field equations are : ( 1 ) vacuum , ( 2 ) spherical symmetry , and ( 3 ) homogeneity and isotropy . each of these symmetries is useful ( and should be familiar ) .",
    "the assumption of vacuum is just the case where there s no matter at all : @xmath19 in this case , the einstein field equation reduces to a wave equation , and the solution is gravitational radiation .",
    "if we assume that the matter distribution @xmath20 has spherical symmetry , the solution to the einstein field equations is the schwarzschild solution describing a black hole . the third case , homogeneity and isotropy , is the one we will concern ourselves with in more detail here @xcite . by homogeneity , we mean that the universe is invariant under spatial translations , and by isotropy we mean that the universe is invariant under rotations .",
    "( a universe that is isotropic everywhere is necessarily homogeneous , but a homogeneous universe need not be isotropic : imagine a homogeneous space filled with a uniform electric field ! ) we will model the contents of the universe as a perfect fluid with density @xmath21 and pressure @xmath22 , for which the stress - energy tensor is @xmath23 while this is certainly a poor description of the contents of the universe on small scales , such as the size of people or planets or even galaxies , it is an excellent approximation if we average over extremely large scales in the universe , for which the matter is known observationally to be very smoothly distributed .",
    "if the matter in the universe is homogeneous and isotropic , then the metric tensor must also obey the symmetry .",
    "the most general line element consistent with homogeneity and isotropy is @xmath24 where the _ scale factor _",
    "@xmath25 contains all the dynamics of the universe , and the vector product @xmath26 contains the geometry of the space , which can be either euclidean ( @xmath27 ) or positively or negatively curved .",
    "the metric tensor for the euclidean case is particularly simple , @xmath28 which can be compared to the minkowski metric ( [ eqminkowskimetric ] ) . in this _ friedmann - robertson - walker _",
    "( frw ) space , spatial distances are multiplied by a dynamical factor @xmath25 that describes the expansion ( or contraction ) of the spacetime . with the general metric ( [ eqrwmetric ] )",
    ", the einstein field equations take on a particularly simple form , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a constant that describes the curvature of the space : @xmath31 ( flat ) , or @xmath32 ( positive or negative curvature ) .",
    "this is known as the _ friedmann equation_. in addition , we have a second - order equation @xmath33 note that the second derivative of the scale factor depends on the equation of state of the fluid .",
    "the equation of state is frequently given by a parameter @xmath34 , or @xmath35 .",
    "note that for any fluid with positive pressure , @xmath36 , the expansion of the universe is gradually decelerating , @xmath37 : the mutual gravitational attraction of the matter in the universe slows the expansion .",
    "this characteristic will be central to the discussion that follows .",
    "general relativity combined with homogeneity and isotropy leads to a startling conclusion : spacetime is dynamic .",
    "the universe is not static , but is bound to be either expanding or contracting . in the early 1900 s ,",
    "einstein applied general relativity to the homogeneous and isotropic case , and upon seeing the consequences , decided that the answer had to be wrong .",
    "since the universe was obviously static , the equations had to be fixed .",
    "einstein s method for fixing the equations involved the evolution of the density @xmath21 with expansion . returning to our analogy between general relativity and electromagnetism",
    ", we remember that maxwell s equations ( [ eqmax ] ) imply the conservation of charge , @xmath38 or , in vector notation , @xmath39 the general relativistic equivalent to charge conservation is stress - energy conservation , ) and ( [ eqraychaud ] ) taken together imply eq .",
    "( [ eqcontinuity ] ) . ]",
    "@xmath40 for a homogeneous fluid with the stress - energy given by eq .",
    "( [ eqfluidse ] ) , stress - energy conservation takes the form of the _ continuity equation _ , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the hubble parameter from eq .",
    "( [ eqrw ] ) .",
    "this equation relates the evolution of the energy density to its equation of state @xmath35 .",
    "suppose we have a box whose dimensions are expanding along with the universe , so that the volume of the box is proportional to the cube of the scale factor , @xmath43 , and we fill it with some kind of matter or radiation . for example , ordinary matter in a box of volume @xmath44 has an energy density inversely proportional to the volume of the box , @xmath45 .",
    "it is straightforward to show using the continuity equation that this corresponds to zero pressure , @xmath46 .",
    "relativistic particles such as photons have energy density that goes as @xmath47 , which corresponds to equation of state @xmath48 .",
    "einstein noticed that if we take the stress - energy @xmath12 and add a constant @xmath49 , the conservation equation ( [ eqsecons ] ) is unchanged : @xmath50 in our analogy with electromagnetism , this is like adding a constant to the electromagnetic potential , @xmath51 .",
    "the constant @xmath49 does not affect local dynamics in any way , but it does affect the cosmology . since adding this constant adds a constant energy density to the universe , the continuity equation tells us that this is equivalent to a fluid with _ negative _ pressure , @xmath52 .",
    "einstein chose @xmath49 to give a closed , static universe as follows @xcite .",
    "take the energy density to consist of matter @xmath53 and cosmological constant @xmath54 it is a simple matter to use the friedmann equation to show that this combination of matter and cosmological constant leads to a static universe @xmath55 . in order for the energy densities to be positive ,",
    "the universe must be closed , @xmath56 .",
    "einstein was able to add a kludge to get the answer he wanted .",
    "things sometimes happen in science with uncanny timing . in the 1920 s ,",
    "an astronomer named edwin hubble undertook a project to measure the distances to the spiral `` nebulae '' as they had been known , using the 100-inch mount wilson telescope .",
    "hubble s method involved using cepheid variables , named after the star delta cephei , the best known member of the class .",
    "cepheid variables have the useful property that the period of their variation , usually 10 - 100 days , is correlated to their absolute brightness .",
    "therefore , by measuring the apparent brightness and the period of a distant cepheid , one can determine its absolute brightness and therefore its distance .",
    "hubble applied this method to a number of nearby galaxies , and determined that almost all of them were receding from the earth .",
    "moreover , the more distant the galaxy was , the faster it was receding , according to a roughly linear relation : @xmath57 this is the famous hubble law , and the constant @xmath58 is known as hubble s constant .",
    "hubble s original value for the constant was something like @xmath59 , where one megaparsec ( @xmath60 ) is a bit over 3 million light years .. ] this implied an age for the universe of about a billion years , and contradicted known geological estimates for the age of the earth .",
    "cosmology had its first `` age problem '' : the universe ca nt be younger than the things in it !",
    "later it was realized that hubble had failed to account for two distinct types of cepheids , and once this discrepancy was taken into account , the hubble constant fell to well under @xmath61 .",
    "the current best estimate , determined using the hubble space telescope to resolve cepheids in galaxies at unprecedented distances , is @xmath62 @xcite . in any case , the hubble law is exactly what one would expect from the friedmann equation .",
    "the expansion of the universe predicted ( and rejected ) by einstein had been observationally detected , only a few years after the development of general relativity .",
    "einstein is said to have later referred to the introduction of the cosmological constant as his `` greatest blunder '' ( a quote which may be apocryphal : see p. 9 of the review by padmanabhan @xcite ) .",
    "the expansion of the universe leads to a number of interesting things .",
    "one is the cosmological redshift of photons . the usual way to see",
    "this is that from the hubble law , distant objects appear to be receding at a velocity @xmath63 , which means that photons emitted from the body are redshifted due to the recession velocity of the source .",
    "there is another way to look at the same effect : because of the expansion of space , the wavelength of a photon increases with the scale factor : @xmath64 so that as the universe expands , a photon propagating in the space gets shifted to longer and longer wavelengths",
    ". the redshift @xmath65 of a photon is then given by the ratio of the scale factor today to the scale factor when the photon was emitted : @xmath66 here we have introduced commonly used the convention that a subscript @xmath67 ( e.g. , @xmath68 or @xmath58 ) indicates the value of a quantity _",
    "today_. this redshifting due to expansion applies to particles other than photons as well . for some massive body moving relative to the expansion with some momentum @xmath22 , the momentum also `` redshifts '' : @xmath69 we then have the remarkable result that freely moving bodies in an expanding universe eventually come to rest relative to the expanding coordinate system , the so - called _ comoving _ frame .",
    "the expansion of the universe creates a kind of dynamical friction for everything moving in it . for this reason",
    ", it will often be convenient to define comoving variables , which have the effect of expansion factored out .",
    "for example , the physical distance between two points in the expanding space is proportional to @xmath25 .",
    "we define the comoving distance between two points to be a constant in time : @xmath70 similarly , we define the comoving wavelength of a photon as @xmath71 and comoving momenta are defined as : @xmath72 this energy loss with expansion has a predictable effect on systems in thermal equilibrium . if we take some bunch of particles ( say , photons with a black - body distribution ) in thermal equilibrium with temperature @xmath73 , the momenta of all these particles will decrease linearly with expansion , and the system will cool . for a gas in thermal equilibrium , the temperature is in fact inversely proportional to the scale factor : @xmath74 the current temperature of the universe is about @xmath75 .",
    "since it has been cooling with expansion , we reach the conclusion that the early universe must have been at a much higher temperature .",
    "this is the `` hot big bang '' picture : a hot , thermal equilibrium universe expanding and cooling with time .",
    "one thing to note is that , although the universe goes to infinite density and infinite temperature at the big bang singularity , it does _ not _ necessarily go to zero size .",
    "a flat universe , for example is infinite in spatial extent an infinitesimal amount of time after the big bang , which happens _ everywhere _ in the infinite space simultaneously !",
    "the observable universe , as measured by the horizon size , goes to zero size at @xmath76 , but the observable universe represents only a tiny patch of the total space .",
    "one of the things that cosmologists most want to measure accurately is the total density @xmath21 of the universe .",
    "this is most often expressed in units of the density needed to make the universe flat , or @xmath31 .",
    "taking the friedmann equation for a @xmath31 universe , @xmath77 we can define a critical density @xmath78 , @xmath79 which tells us , for a given value of the hubble constant @xmath58 , the energy density of a euclidean frw space .",
    "if the energy density is greater than critical , @xmath80 , the universe is closed and has a positive curvature ( @xmath56 ) . in this case",
    ", the universe also has a finite lifetime , eventually collapsing back on itself in a `` big crunch '' . if @xmath81 , the universe is open , with negative curvature , and has an infinite lifetime .",
    "this is usually expressed in terms of the density parameter @xmath82 , @xmath83 there has long been a debate between theorists and observers as to what the value of @xmath82 is in the real universe .",
    "theorists have steadfastly maintained that the only sensible value for @xmath82 is unity , @xmath84 .",
    "this prejudice was further strengthened by the development of the theory of inflation , which solves several cosmological puzzles ( see secs .",
    "[ secflatnessproblem ] and [ sechorizonproblem ] ) and in fact _ predicts _ that @xmath82 will be exponentially close to unity .",
    "observers , however , have made attempts to measure @xmath82 using a variety of methods , including measuring galactic rotation curves , the velocities of galaxies orbiting in clusters , x - ray measurements of galaxy clusters , the velocities and spatial distribution of galaxies on large scales , and gravitational lensing .",
    "these measurements have repeatedly pointed to a value of @xmath82 inconsistent with a flat cosmology , with @xmath85 being a much better fit , indicating an open , negatively curved universe . until a few years ago ,",
    "theorists have resorted to cheerfully ignoring the data , taking it almost on faith that @xmath86 in extra stuff would turn up sooner or later .",
    "the theorists were right : new observations of the cosmic microwave background definitively favor a flat universe , @xmath84 .",
    "unsurprisingly , the observationalists were also right : only about @xmath87 of this density appears to be in the form of ordinary matter .    the first hint that something strange was up with the standard cosmology came from measurements of the colors of stars in globular clusters .",
    "globular clusters are small , dense groups of @xmath88 - @xmath89 stars which orbit in the halos of most galaxies and are among the oldest objects in the universe .",
    "their ages are determined by observation of stellar populations and models of stellar evolution , and some globular clusters are known to be at least 12 billion years old @xcite , implying that the universe itself must be at least 12 billion years old . but consider a flat universe ( @xmath84 ) filled with pressureless matter , @xmath90 and @xmath46 . it is straightforward to solve the friedmann equation ( [ eqrw ] ) with @xmath31 to show that @xmath91 the hubble parameter is then given by @xmath92 we therefore have a simple expression for the age of the universe @xmath68 in terms of the measured hubble constant @xmath58 , @xmath93 the fact that the universe has a finite age introduces the concept of a _ horizon _ :",
    "this is just how far out in space we are capable of seeing at any given time .",
    "this distance is finite because photons have only traveled a finite distance since the beginning of the universe .",
    "just as in special relativity , photons travel on paths with proper length @xmath94 , so that we can write the physical distance a photon has traveled since the big bang , or the _ horizon size _ , as @xmath95 ( this is in units where the speed of light is set to @xmath96 . ) for example , in a flat , matter - dominated universe , @xmath97 , so that the horizon size is @xmath98 this form for the horizon distance is true in general : the distance a photon travels in time @xmath99 is always about @xmath100 : effects from expansion simply add a numerical factor out front .",
    "we will frequently ignore this , and approximate @xmath101 measured values of @xmath58 are quoted in a very strange unit of time , a km / s / mpc , but it is a simple matter to calculate the dimensionless factor using @xmath102 , so that the age of a flat , matter - dominated universe with @xmath62 is @xmath103 a flat , matter - dominated universe would be younger than the things in it !",
    "something is evidently wrong  either the estimates of globular cluster ages are too big , the measurement of the hubble constant from from the hst is incorrect , the universe is not flat , or the universe is not matter dominated .",
    "we will take for granted that the measurement of the hubble constant is correct , and that the models of stellar structure are good enough to produce a reliable estimate of globular cluster ages ( as they appear to be ) , and focus on the last two possibilities .",
    "an open universe , @xmath104 , might solve the age problem .",
    "figure [ figage ] shows the age of the universe consistent with the hst key project value for @xmath58 as a function of the density parameter @xmath105 .",
    "0.5 cm    we see that the age determined from @xmath58 is consistent with globular clusters as old as 12 billion years only for values of @xmath105 less than @xmath106 or so .",
    "however , as we will see in sec .",
    "[ seccmb ] , recent measurements of the cosmic microwave background strongly indicate that we indeed live in a flat ( @xmath84 ) universe . so",
    "while a low - density universe might provide a marginal solution to the age problem , it would conflict with the cmb .",
    "we therefore , perhaps reluctantly , are forced to consider that the universe might not be matter dominated . in the next section",
    "we will take a detour into quantum field theory seemingly unrelated to these cosmological issues . by the time we are finished , however , we will have in hand a different , and provocative , solution to the age problem consistent with a flat universe .      in this section",
    ", we will discuss something that at first glance appears to be entirely unrelated to cosmology : the vacuum in quantum field theory .",
    "we will see later , however , that it will in fact be crucially important to cosmology .",
    "let us start with basic quantum mechanics , in the form of the simple harmonic oscillator , with hamiltonian @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath109 are the lowering and raising operators , respectively , with commutation relation @xmath110 = 1.\\ ] ] this leads to the familiar ladder of energy eigenstates @xmath111 , @xmath112 the simple harmonic oscillator is pretty much the only problem that physicists know how to solve . applying the old rule",

    ", each momentum vector @xmath122 has an independent ladder of states , with the associated quantum numbers , @xmath123 . the raising and lowering operators",
    "are now interpreted as _ creation _ and _ annihilation _ operators , turning a ket with @xmath124 particles into a ket with @xmath125 particles , and vice - versa : @xmath126 and we call the ground state @xmath127 the _ vacuum _ , or zero - particle state .",
    "but there is one small problem : just like the ground state of a single harmonic oscillator has a nonzero energy @xmath128 , the vacuum state of the quantum field also has an energy , @xmath129 } \\left\\vert 0 \\right\\rangle\\cr & = & \\left[\\int^{\\infty}_{-\\infty}{d^3 k \\left(\\hbar \\omega_k / 2\\right)}\\right ] \\left\\vert 0 \\right\\rangle\\cr & = & \\infty.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the ground state energy diverges !",
    "the solution to this apparent paradox is that we expect quantum field theory to break down at very high energy .",
    "we therefore introduce a cutoff on the momentum @xmath117 at high energy , so that the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eqdivergentvacuum ] ) becomes finite .",
    "a reasonable physical scale for the cutoff is the scale at which we expect quantum gravitational effects to become relevant , the _ planck scale _ @xmath130 : @xmath131 therefore we expect the vacuum everywhere to have a constant energy density , given in units where @xmath132 as @xmath133 but we have already met up with an energy density that is constant everywhere in space : einstein s cosmological constant , @xmath134 ,  @xmath135 .",
    "however , the cosmological constant we expect from quantum field theory is more than a hundred twenty orders of magnitude too big . in order for @xmath136 to be less than the critical density , @xmath137 , we must have @xmath138 !",
    "how can we explain this discrepancy ?",
    "nobody knows .      so what does this have to do with cosmology ?",
    "the interesting fact about vacuum energy is that it results in accelerated expansion of the universe . from eq .",
    "( [ eqraychaud ] ) , we can write the acceleration @xmath139 in terms of the equation of state @xmath35 of the matter in the universe , @xmath140 for ordinary matter such as pressureless dust @xmath141 or radiation @xmath142 , we see that the gravitational attraction of all the stuff in the universe makes the expansion slow down with time , @xmath37 .",
    "but we have seen that a cosmological constant has the odd property of negative pressure , @xmath143 , so that a universe dominated by vacuum energy actually expands faster and faster with time , @xmath144 .",
    "it is easy to see that accelerating expansion helps with the age problem : for a standard matter - dominated universe , a larger hubble constant means a _ younger universe _ ,",
    "but if the expansion of the universe is accelerating , this means that @xmath146 grows with time . for a given age @xmath68",
    ", acceleration means that the hubble constant we measure will be larger in an accelerating cosmology than in a decelerating one , so we can have our cake and eat it too : an old universe and a high hubble constant !",
    "this also resolves the old dispute between the observers and the theorists .",
    "astronomers measuring the density of the universe use local dynamical measurements such as the orbital velocities of galaxies in a cluster .",
    "these measurements are insensitive to a cosmological constant and only measure the _ matter _ density @xmath147 of the universe . however , geometrical tests like the cosmic microwave background which we will discuss in the sec .",
    "[ seccmb ] are sensitive to the _ total _ energy density @xmath148 . if we take the observational value for the matter density @xmath149 and make up the difference with a cosmological constant , @xmath150 , we arrive at an age for the universe in excess of @xmath151 , perfectly consistent with the globular cluster data .    in the 1980s and 1990s",
    ", there were some researchers making the argument based on the age problem alone that we needed a cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "there were also some observational indications favoring a cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "but the case was hardly compelling , given that the cmb results indicating a flat universe had not yet been measured , and a low - density universe presented a simpler alternative , based on a cosmology containing matter alone .",
    "however , there was another observation that pointed clearly toward the need for @xmath152 : type ia supernovae ( snia ) measurements .",
    "a detailed discussion of these measurements is beyond the scope of these lectures , but the principle is simple : sneia represent a _ standard candle _ , i.e. objects whose intrinsic brightness we know , based on observations of nearby supernovae .",
    "they are also extremely bright , so they can be observed at cosmological distances .",
    "two collaborations , the supernova cosmology project @xcite and the high - z supernova search @xcite obtained samples of supernovae at redshifts around @xmath153 .",
    "this is far enough out that it is possible to measure deviations from the linear hubble law @xmath63 due to the time - evolution of the hubble parameter : the groups were able to _ measure _ the acceleration or deceleration of the universe directly .",
    "if the universe is decelerating , objects at a given redshift will be closer to us , and therefore brighter than we would expect based on a linear hubble law .",
    "conversely , if the expansion is accelerating , objects at a given redshift will be further away , and therefore dimmer .",
    "the result from both groups was that the supernovae were consistently dimmer than expected .",
    "[ figscp ] shows the data from the supernova cosmology project @xcite , who quoted a best fit of @xmath154 , @xmath155 , just what was needed to reconcile the dynamical mass measurements with a flat universe !",
    "so we have arrived at a very curious picture indeed of the universe : matter , including both baryons and the mysterious dark matter ( which i will not discuss in any detail in these lectures ) makes up only about 30% of the energy density in the universe .",
    "the remaining 70% is made of of something that looks very much like einstein s `` greatest blunder '' , a cosmological constant .",

    "these density fluctuations are of great physical interest , first because these are the fluctuations which later collapsed to form all of the structure in the universe , from superclusters to planets to graduate students .",
    "second , we shall see that within the paradigm of inflation , the form of the primordial density fluctuations forms a powerful probe of the physics of the very early universe .",

    "later on , i will discuss using the cmb as a tool to probe other physics , especially the physics of inflation .",
    "while the physics of recombination in the homogeneous case is quite simple , the presence of inhomogeneities in the universe makes the situation much more complicated .",
    "i will describe some of the major effects qualitatively here , and refer the reader to the literature for a more detailed technical explanation of the relevant physics @xcite . the complete linear theory of cmb fluctuations",
    "was first worked out by bertschinger and ma in 1995 @xcite .",
    "the simplest contribution to the cmb anisotropy from density fluctuations is just a gravitational redshift , known as the _ sachs - wolfe effect _ @xcite .",
    "a photon coming from a region which is slightly overdense will have a slightly larger redshift due to the deeper gravitational well at the surface of last scattering .",
    "conversely , a photon coming from an underdense region will have a slightly smaller redshift .",

    "fluctuations on large angular scales ( low multipoles ) are actually larger than the horizon at the time of last scattering , so that this essentially kinematic contribution to the cmb anisotropy is dominant on large angular scales .      for fluctuation modes smaller than the horizon size",

    "even a summary of the many effects that determine the precise shape of the cmb multipole spectrum is beyond the scope of these lectures , and the student is referred to refs .",
    "@xcite for a more detailed discussion .",
    "however , the dominant process that occurs on short wavelengths is important to us .",
    "these are _ acoustic oscillations _ in the baryon / photon plasma .",
    "the idea is simple : matter tends to collapse due to gravity onto regions where the density is higher than average , so the baryons `` fall '' into overdense regions .",
    "however , since the baryons and the photons are still strongly coupled , the photons tend to resist this collapse and push the baryons outward .",
    "the result is `` ringing '' , or oscillatory modes of compression and rarefaction in the gas due to density fluctuations .",
    "the gas heats as it compresses and cools as it expands , and this creates fluctuations in the temperature of the cmb .",
    "this manifests itself in the @xmath200 spectrum as a series of bumps ( fig .",
    "[ figclflatopen ] ) . the specific shape and location of the bumps",
    "is created by complicated , although well - understood physics , involving a large number of cosmological parameters .",
    "the shape of the cmb multipole spectrum depends , for example , on the baryon density @xmath175 , the hubble constant @xmath58 , the densities of matter @xmath201 and cosmological constant @xmath152 , and the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves ( see sec . [ secinflationflucts ] ) .",
    "this makes interpretation of the spectrum something of a complex undertaking , but it also makes it a sensitive probe of cosmological models . in these lectures , i will primarily focus on the cmb as a probe of inflation , but there is much more to the story",
    ".    these oscillations are sound waves in the direct sense : compression waves in the gas .",
    "the position of the bumps in @xmath196 is determined by the oscillation frequency of the mode .",
    "the first bump is created by modes that have had time to go through half an oscillation in the age of the universe ( compression ) , the second bump modes that have gone through one full oscillation ( rarefaction ) , and so on .",
    "so what is the wavelength of a mode that goes through half an oscillation in a hubble time ?",
    "about the horizon size at the time of recombination , 300,000 light years or so !",
    "this is an immensely powerful tool : it in essence provides us with a ruler of known length ( the wavelength of the oscillation mode , or the horizon size at recombination ) , situated at a known distance ( the distance to the surface of last scattering at @xmath202 ) .",
    "the angular size of this ruler when viewed at a fixed distance depends on the curvature of the space that lies between us and the surface of last scattering ( fig .",
    "[ figgeometry ] ) .",
    "0.5 cm    if the space is negatively curved , the ruler will subtend a smaller angle than if the space is flat ; if the space is positively curved , the ruler will subtend a larger angle .",
    "we can measure the `` angular size '' of our `` ruler '' by looking at where the first acoustic peak shows up on the plot of the @xmath203 spectrum of cmb fluctuations .",

    "for an equation of state with @xmath211 , which is the case for any kind of `` ordinary '' matter , a flat universe is an unstable equilibrium : @xmath212 so if the universe at early times deviates even slightly from a flat geometry , that deviation will grow large at late times .",
    "if the universe today is flat to within @xmath213 , then @xmath82 the time of recombination was @xmath214 , and at nucleosynthesis @xmath215 .",

    "this curious fine - tuning in cosmology is referred to as the _ flatness problem_.      there is another odd fact about the observed universe : the apparent high degree of uniformity and thermal equilibrium of the cmb .",
    "while it might at first seem quite natural for the hot gas of the early universe to be in good thermal equilibrium , this is in fact quite _ unnatural _ in the standard big bang picture .",
    "this is because of the presence of a cosmological horizon .",
    "we recall that the horizon size of the universe is just how far a photon can have traveled since the big bang , @xmath216 in units where @xmath96 .",
    "this defines how large a `` patch '' of the universe can be in causal contact .",
    "two points in the universe separated by more than a horizon size have no way to reach thermal equilibrium , since they can not have _ ever _ been in causal contact .",

    "the physical distance @xmath217 between the two points then just increases linearly with the scale factor : @xmath218 the horizon size is just proportional to the time , or equivalently to the inverse of the hubble parameter , @xmath219 it is straightforward to show that for any frw space with constant equation of state , there is a conserved quantity given by @xmath220 proof of this is also left as an exercise for the student .",
    "if we again consider the case of `` ordinary '' matter , with equation of state @xmath211 , we see from eqs .",
    "( [ eqflatnessproblem ] ) and ( [ eqfrwconserved ] ) that the horizon expands faster than a comoving length : @xmath221 this means that any two points at rest relative to the expansion of the universe will be causally disconnected at early times and causally connected at late times .",

    "how did all of these disconnected regions reach such a high degree of thermal equilibrium ?",
    "the flatness and horizon problems have no solutions within the context of a standard matter- or radiation - dominated universe , since for any ordinary matter , the force of gravity causes the expansion of the universe to decelerate . the only available fix would appear to be to invoke initial conditions : the universe simply started out flat , hot , and in thermal equilibrium . while this is certainly a possibility , it hardly a satisfying explanation . it would be preferable to have an explanation for _ why _ the universe was flat , hot , and in thermal equilibrium .",
    "such an explanation was proposed by alan guth in 1980 @xcite under the name of _",
    "inflation_. inflation is the idea that at some very early epoch , the expansion of the universe was accelerating instead of decelerating .",
    "accelerating expansion turns the horizon and flatness problems on their heads .",
    "this is evident from the equation for the acceleration , @xmath231 we see immediately that the condition for acceleration @xmath144 is that the equation of state be characterized by negative pressure , @xmath232 .",

    "( [ eqfrwconserved ] ) , we see that comoving scales grow in size more quickly than the horizon , @xmath234 this is a very remarkable behavior .",
    "it means that two points that are initially in causal contact ( @xmath235 ) will expand so rapidly that they will eventually be causally _ disconnected_. put another way , two points in space whose relative velocity due to expansion is less than the speed of light will eventually be flying apart from each other at greater than the speed of light ! note that there is absolutely no violation of the principles of relativity .",
    "relative velocities @xmath236 are allowed in general relativity as long as the observers are sufficiently separated in space .",
    "this mechanism provides a neat way to explain the apparent homogeneity of the universe on scales much larger than the horizon size : a tiny region of the universe , initially in some sort of equilibrium , is `` blown up '' by accelerated expansion to an enormous and causally disconnected scale .",
    "we can plot the inflationary universe on a conformal diagram ( fig .",

    "how much inflation do we need to solve the horizon and flatness problems ?",

    "we will discuss the observational predictions of various models in section [ secinflationzoology ] below . in the next section , we will discuss one of the central observational predictions of inflation : the generation of primordial density fluctuations .",
    "so far we have seen that the standard frw cosmology has two ( related ) unexplained issues : why is the universe so flat and why is it so smooth ?",
    "these questions are difficult to answer in the context of a matter- or radiation - dominated cosmology without resorting to simply setting the initial conditions of the universe to match what we see , certainly an unsatisfying solution .",
    "the idea of _ inflation _ , a period of accelerated expansion in the very early universe , provides an elegant solution to these problems . at some early time , the energy density of the universe was dominated by something with an equation of state approximating that of vacuum energy , @xmath279 .",
    "( in the discussion above , we considered a single scalar field as a model for such a fluid . ) the useful thing about inflation is that it dynamically drives the universe toward a flat ( @xmath84 ) geometry , and simultaneously drives causally connected points to non - causal regions , explaining the homogeneity of the universe on scales larger than the horizon .",
    "this is an appealing scenario , but it is short on observational consequences : how do we tell whether or not inflation actually happened ?    very soon after the introduction of inflation by guth , it was realized that inflation had another remarkable property : it could explain the generation of the primordial density fluctuations in the universe .",
    "this was first worked out independently by hawking @xcite , starobinsky @xcite , and by guth @xcite .",

    "are interpreted as pairs of virtual particles appearing and then immediately annihilating as a consequence of the heisenberg uncertainty principle .",
    "one qualitative explanation of hawking radiation at the event horizon of a black hole is that one of the two virtual particles is trapped by the horizon , leaving the other to escape as apparently thermal radiation .",

    "<S> these four lectures cover four topics in modern cosmology : the cosmological constant , the cosmic microwave background , inflation , and cosmology as a probe of physics at the planck scale . </S>",
    "<S> the underlying theme is that cosmology gives us a unique window on the `` physics of nothing , '' or the quantum - mechanical properties of the vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> the theory of inflation postulates that vacuum energy , or something very much like it , was the dominant force shaping the evolution of the very early universe . </S>",
    "<S> recent astrophysical observations indicate that vacuum energy , or something very much like it , is also the dominant component of the universe today . </S>",
    "<S> therefore cosmology gives us a way to study an important piece of particle physics inaccessible to accelerators . </S>",
    "<S> the lectures are oriented toward graduate students with only a passing familiarity with general relativity and knowledge of basic quantum field theory . </S>"
