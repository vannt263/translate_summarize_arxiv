    "much of observational cosmology can be thought of as an attempt to use astronomical data to discriminate between the different cosmological models under consideration . given both the inevitably imperfect data and the intrinsically stochastic nature of many cosmological measurements ( _ i.e. _ , cosmic variance ) ,",
    "it is generally impossible to come to absolute conclusions about the various candidate models ; the best that can be hoped for is to evaluate the probabilities , conditional on the the available data , that each of the candidate models is the correct description of the universe .",
    "the fact that there is , as far as is known , just a single observable universe ( _ i.e. _ , there is no ensemble from which it has been drawn ) , means that such probabilities can not be frequency - based , and must instead must represent a degree of implication .",
    "self - consistency arguments then require ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* cox 1946 ) ) that these probabilities be manipulated and inverted using bayes s theorem .    taken together ,",
    "the above facts imply that bayesian model comparison ( section  [ section : bmc ] ) should be used to assess how well different cosmological models explain the available data , although the fact that most such models have unspecified parameters is a significant difficulty for this approach ( section  [ section : noprior ] ) .",
    "this problem can be solved for separable data - sets as it is possible to use a two - step method of model comparison ( section  [ section : sep ] ) , illustrated here with high - redshift supernova ( sn ) data ( section  [ section : sn ] ) .",
    "given that one of a set of @xmath0 models , @xmath1 , is assumed to be true , the state of knowledge conditional on all the available ( and relevant ) information , @xmath2 , is fully summarised by the probabilities @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the probability that the @xmath5th model is correct ( and @xmath6 ) . in the light of some new data , @xmath7 , that has not already been included in the above probabilities , bayes s theorem gives the updated probability that model @xmath5 is correct as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the marginal likelihood under model @xmath10 .",
    "if model @xmath10 has @xmath11 unspecified parameters @xmath12 then the model - averaged likelihood is obtained by marginalising over these parameters to give @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the prior distribution of the parameter values in this model .",
    "this expression demonstrates that the full specification of a model requires not just an explicit parameterisation , but a distribution for those parameters as well ; two mathematically identical descriptions with different parameter priors are , in fact , different models .",
    "equations [ equation : bt ] and [ equation : ev ] together summarise a self - consistent method for assessing which of a set of models is better supported by the available information , provided that the parameter priors for all the models are explicitly defined and unit - normalised . in particular ,",
    "while it is often possible to obtain sensible parameter constraints based on an improper prior , such as @xmath14 constant for all @xmath15 , the resultant marginal likelihood is meaningless ( ( * ? ? ? *",
    "dickey 1961 ) ) .",
    "unfortunately , it is commonly the case in astronomy and cosmology that there is no compelling form for the models parameter priors and , further , that the natural uninformative prior distributions are improper and can not be normalised .",
    "the apparent implication is that bayesian model comparison , at least in the form described in section  [ section : bmc ] , can not be used in cosmology , an idea that has been explored previously by , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the disturbing corollary would be that there is no self - consistent method to choose between the available cosmological models , even if they are completely quantitative and mathematically well - defined .",
    "the idea that the relative degree of support for models with unspecified parameters is undefined is at odds with the marked  and data - driven  progress that has been made in cosmology over the last century .",
    "clearly it _ is _ possible to use data to choose sensibly between models even if they do not have well - motivated parameter priors ; but can this be formalised in a way that satisfies bayes s theorem and is hence logically self - consistent ?    one possibility is , for separable data - sets ( such as those which consist of measurements of many astronomical sources ) , to use some of the available data to obtain the necessary parameter priors and to then use the remaining data for model comparison .",
    "this is an old concept , dating back at least to @xcite and explored subsequently by , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the central idea is to partition the data as @xmath16 , with the first partition of training data used to obtain the ( partial ) posterior distribution for the parameters of @xmath5th model as @xmath17 where @xmath14 , which need _ not _ be normaliseable , should be a highly uninformative prior .",
    "this posterior distribution can then be used as the prior needed to obtain a meaningful marginal likelihood , which can then be evaluated for the testing data as @xmath18    this marginal likelihood is coherent , in the sense that it provides self - consistent updated posterior probabilities when inserted into equation  [ equation : bt ] , but there is also ambiguity in how to partition the data : there is no compelling scheme for partitioning the data .",
    "it is tempting to average over the possible partitions , but this approach does not have a rigorous motivation . despite these ambiguities , this two - step method of bayesian model comparison for separable data",
    "does satisfy the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* cox ( 1946 ) ) self - consistency requirements and so provide a means of calculating posterior probabilities for cosmological models with unspecified parameter priors .",
    "and @xmath19 implied by the @xcite scp sn data and a uniform prior with @xmath20 . highest posterior density contours enclosing 68.3% , 95.4% and 99.7% of the posterior probability are shown .",
    "also shown are the prior distributions of the accelerating model and matter only model for @xmath21 .",
    "( right ) the dependence of @xmath22 on @xmath23 , shown for different prior probabilities , @xmath24.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]   and @xmath19 implied by the @xcite scp sn data and a uniform prior with @xmath20 .",

    "( right ) the dependence of @xmath22 on @xmath23 , shown for different prior probabilities , @xmath24.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    one of the most significant recent cosmological discoveries was that the universe s expansion rate is increasing , a result which is often linked most strongly to the observations of distant sne made by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the comparative faintness of the sne , given their redshifts and light - curve decay timescales , indicated that the ( normalised ) cosmological constant , @xmath19 , is sufficiently large to override the deceleration caused by the ( normalised ) matter density , @xmath25 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite used their sne measurements , @xmath7 , to obtain posterior distributions of the form @xmath26 , under the assumption of uninformative ( and improper ) uniform priors of the form @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the heaviside step function .",
    "the posterior distribution for the 42 scp sne from @xcite , reproduced in figure  [ figure : posterior ] , reveals that most of the models that are consistent with the data correspond to an accelerating universe ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath29 ) .    but",
    "do these data provide _ quantitive _ evidence of cosmological acceleration ?",
    "@xcite approached this question by calculating the fraction of the posterior with @xmath29 , which is an apparently compelling 0.997 for the case shown in figure  [ figure : posterior ] . the relevant bayesian calculation ( _ c.f . _",
    "* drell  2000 ) ) should , however , be based on the marginal likelihoods of an accelerating model ( for which the prior is non - zero only for @xmath29 ) and a decelerating model ( for which the obvious option is a matter - only model with @xmath30 ) .",
    "such models can be fully specified ( in the sense defined in section  [ section : bmc ] ) by adding the restrictions that @xmath31 and @xmath32 $ ] ( defined to reject models that did not begin with a big bang ) , where @xmath33 is an unspecified `` hyper - parameter '' .",
    "figure  [ figure : posterior ] shows the dependence of the posterior probability of the accelerating model , @xmath34 , on @xmath23 .",
    "even the peak values of @xmath34 are considerably lower than the posterior fraction quoted above , and the dependence on the unknown value of @xmath23 is significant as well .    rather than introducing an arbitrary new parameter ,",
    "another option is to adopt the two - step method described in section  [ section : sep ] , using some of the sn data to obtain a partial posterior in @xmath25 and @xmath19 for both the accelerating and matter - only models and then using the remainder to perform model comparison .",
    "the results of doing so are shown in figure  [ figure : prob ] for several different partitioning options ( and assuming the two models are equally probable a priori ) .",
    "these results again illustrate the standard bayesian result that the better - fitting accelerating model is not favoured so decisively over the more predictive ( _ i.e. _ , `` simpler '' ) matter - only model , a result that is robust to prior choice .       obtained from different partitions of the @xcite sn data set with training sets of 10 ( left ) and 21 ( right ) sne .",
