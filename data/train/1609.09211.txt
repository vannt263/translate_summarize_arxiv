    "the most common manifestation of this is the ` mobile phone ' .",
    "modern technology has transformed the mobile phone from a mere communication device to a versatile computing device .",
    "these hand - held devices have enabled us not only to access information , but also to provide information to others on the move .",
    "modern mobile phones , equipped with powerful sensors , have endowed capabilities to provide and create near real - time information .",
    "this real - time information is useful for oneself and for others .",
    "an established approach for sharing and provision of information and creating useful applications in a distributed environment is service oriented architecture ( soa )  @xcite . realizing soa over mobile devices has the potential to convert mobile phones owned by common people from mere _ information subscribers _ to _ information providers _ and beyond .",
    "the major advantage of this is that it can be used in scenarios where there is little or no preexisting infrastructure .",
    "examples of such scenarios include war - front , post - disaster relief management . in such scenarios ,",
    "mobile based soa has the potential to enable ground teams to provide runtime information to commanding units , help teams at disaster sites to exchange data , analyse damage and examine various statistics using mobile devices . in such systems of soa over mobile devices",
    "all three elements of the soa triangle : service providers , service consumers , and service registries are realised over mobile devices .",
    "web services are the proven way towards implementation of a `` service oriented architecture '' .",
    "advancement in mobile device technology has motivated researchers to explore the possibilities of effectively hosting web services over mobile devices , and thereby trying to realize service oriented systems in mobile environments",
    ". there has been substantial work towards enabling mobile devices to host web services  @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "an important aspect of service oriented systems , `` service discovery '' , however , remains a challenge in mobile environments .",
    "there is literature available on service discovery for distributed environments  @xcite@xcite@xcite , but one catering specifically to mobile environments is still lacking .",
    "several challenges specific to hosting web services over mobile devices need to be taken into account in such service discovery mechanisms .",
    "these include , but are not limited to battery and network constraints , limited computational power of mobile devices .",
    "moreover , such dynamic mobile services are prone to uncertainty ( owing to network outage , battery issues , physical damage ) and frequent changes in functionality ( primarily owing to the change of context ) , and hence make frequent service updates a necessity to effectively function as web - services .",
    "the role of the _ service registry _ therefore , becomes one of prominence to properly manage such dynamism .",
    "traditional service registry solutions for web - services such as uddi  @xcite , ebxml  @xcite , can not be directly utilised in such environments that require frequent updates .",
    "what contributes to this is the exhaustive data model of such registry offerings that is hard to analyze and parse for mobile devices at run - time . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the current work is the first attempt to comprehensively investigate these issues and design a dynamic service registry that facilitates service discoveries in mobile environments .    as mentioned earlier",
    ", the ultimate aim is to realize a service oriented architecture over mobile devices without involving high end servers .",
    "hence , the proposed architecture provides all registry related information and operations using mobile devices itself , without requiring high - end computers or high management costs .",
    "further , in order to support scalability , fault tolerance , and fault localization , we propose a distributed and category based service registry . to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach",
    ", we have engineered a prototype deployment .",
    "this includes heterogeneous and loosely coupled mobile devices deployed in a collaborative manner to manage the service registry along with native hosted services .",
    "we also compare the proposed approach with the traditional uddi system for managing service registry from the perspective of mobile devices .",
    "the evaluation shows propitious results in favour of our approach wherein the latter is shown to have acceptable battery requirements , low data communication costs , promising scalability , and little or no hindrance to the working of native applications of mobile devices .    this work is a significant extension of our previous work @xcite . in our previous work",
    "@xcite , we had introduced an xmpp based model to maintain a service registry for mobile environments .",
    "the main focus of the work was to introduce the registry architecture and the communication mechanism followed during service discovery from the registry . in the presented work",
    ", we provide a holistic service registry framework that makes use of xmpp based service registry framework at the core .",
    "we defined the roles for mobile devices involved in the service registry framework to provide a scalable mobile registry solution .",
    "we have further extended the service registry operations to cater the specific needs of the mobile environment .",
    "we further provide detailed descriptions of the various registry operations that facilitate the realisation of a dynamic mobile service registry .",
    "we further evaluated the proposed approach by realizing it through a working prototype and deployed it over mobile devices of volunteers .",
    "we further present a detailed literature survey that covers various categories of service registries .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec : motive ] presents a motivation and requirements for the novel approach .",
    "section  [ sec : arch ] provides details of the proposed approach and design concepts .",
    "various registry operations are discussed in section  [ subsec : operation ] .",

    "kotler et al .",
    "@xcite suggested services as `` activities or benefits offered for sale that are essentially intangible and do not result in the ownership of anything '' .",
    "a mobile service defined in this work is a service that is offered from mobile phones of providers ; this may also include information provided by the mobile sensors , third party software , or human users .",
    "this allows different machines to exchange information with each other over a network , without necessarily requiring a user interface . in general ,",
    "the service may be a component or sub - part of the web application that is usually used by human users .",
    "for example , a chatting web application provides gui to human users to communicate with another human .",
    "while a presence service embedded in the web application detects the presence of other machines , this presence service does not require any human intervention .",
    "_ alice is a high risk cardiovascular patient .",
    "recently , she got an ecg sensor implanted in her body  @xcite that monitors her cardiovascular health and provides statistics and information as a mobile service via her mobile phone .",
    "this service can be consumed by her cardiologist and she can be provided with proper prescriptions as per her current health .",
    "one day she had a sudden cardiac arrest on her way to another city .",
    "alarming variations in her ecg signals were observed by the service on her mobile device and the service discovered the nearest ambulance through the latter s exposed mobile service .",
    "further , her mobile service automatically provided access to her latest ecg signals to the ambulance support medical staff and enabled them to prepare well in advance for the patient .",
    "the ambulance was able to discover her current location through another service on her mobile device that provided gps coordinates .",
    "further , when the ambulance was on its way , the ambulance s mobile service provided the doctors at the nearest hospital with the latest information on the situation . simultaneously , the hospital was able to make use of alice s ecg mobile service to gather her ecg history and prior to her arrival the doctors at the hospital had a chance to study her medical profile and case in detail . on its way to the hospital",
    ", the ambulance was able to make use of the services exposed by other travelers on their respective mobile devices to avoid the busy route and opt for the path with less traffic .",
    "meanwhile , the insurance company was contacted by alice s mobile service and her hospital information was provided , so that the financial aspect could be taken care of even before her arrival .",
    "alice s cardiologist was also able to provide details of his / her prescriptions via his / her mobile service to the doctors in the hospital so that the latter could learn about her medications and allergies if any . _    with rapid advancements in mobile technologies and wireless networking ,",
    "mobile devices have become perhaps the most suitable and economical solutions for the provision of dynamic , transient , contextual , personalized services .",
    "these mobile provisioned services can make the service access handy and convenient for service consumers .",
    "further , the provisioning of mobile services is an economical solution that requires little or no pre - existing infrastructure . in the discussed scenario , alice , her cardiologist , the ambulance",
    ", hospital staff can make use of each other s mobile services in critical situations and can provide assistance to alice .",
    "this explains the importance of mobile services ; subsequently , however , the above scenario also raises a question : `` how is the mobile service consumer able to discover the appropriate service among such large number of services and that too in an uncertain environment as a mobile environment ? '' .",
    "web services hosted on mobile devices are mainly useful for sharing contextual , personal , proximal information . mobile devices in such environments are mostly distributed arbitrarily and make service discovery and management of service registry a cumbersome process . in this section ,",
    "we discuss the need for a novel service registry architecture for mobile environments .    in order to provide an effective service registry for mobile environments , two approaches are possible .",
    "the first is a classical centralized service registry approach where all information on the available mobile services is maintained at one place and this is usually over a powerful computing device ; the second approach is a decentralized service registry approach . here",
    ", the registries are maintained by a system of distributed nodes in such a way that each node caters to a fraction of the services and there is a large degree of redundancy . between these two approaches ,",
    "the decentralised service registry approach appears to be more appropriate for mobile environments .",
    "there are several reasons for this such as the issue of a single - point - of - failure in the case of a centralised system , the lack of a definite guarantee of continuous reliable connections between mobile devices and the central server , the difficulties of rapid and regular updates in large centralised registries thus giving rise to obsolete information and so on .",
    "there are , of course , drawbacks in the decentralised system as well .",
    "it is these drawbacks that we will discuss and attempt to overcome in the rest of this paper .",
    "cloud offloading is another approach that is often used for facilitating services over mobile devices . in cloud offloading , the service logic ,",
    "usually , resides on the cloud and the mobile devices may work as the proxy for these services .",
    "the associated concerns of cloud offloading  @xcite ( significant network delay and latency , rigid sla requirements etc .",
    ") however do not make it a potential candidate for dynamic mobile service registry .",
    "sanaei et.al .",
    "@xcite discuss these challenges in detail .",
    "a decentralised service registry may be realised using either traditional service registry approaches that are commonly used in legacy wired systems ( such as uddi  @xcite , ebxml  @xcite ) or a new approach especially catering to the vagaries of mobile environments may be adopted .",
    "though possible , adopting traditional registry approaches such as uddi  @xcite from w3c is ill suited to dynamic mobile environments .",
    "the traditional registry architecture comprises uddi data entities ( businessentity , businessservice , bindingtemplate , tmodel , publisherassertion , subscription ) , various uddi services and api sets , uddi nodes for supporting node api set , uddi registries .",
    "such a base architecture is quite ` heavyweight ' and makes it difficult to host uddi over mobile and resource constrained devices .",
    "further , services offered over mobile devices tend to behave in an anarchic manner ; as the changes in the functional , non - functional , other aspect of the services may be quite frequent owing to regular change in context and networking environment of the device .",
    "this requires frequent updates to the service registry .",
    "uddi , on the other hand , is designed around concepts of soap / wsdl , heavyweight technologies that make frequent updates a cumbersome process.as a consequence , the information on the uddi registry quickly becomes obsolete . a new approach ,",
    "therefore , is imperative for maintaining an effective registry system for mobile environments .      before we get into detailed discussions on the proposed approach , here is a quick point - wise summary of the requirements for effective service registries for mobile environments .",
    "this is along the lines of dustdar et al .",
    "@xcite who did something similar for articulating general requirements for web service registries .",
    "_ r1 : management of transient web services : _ the very nature of mobile devices makes hosted web services repeatedly and randomly enter and leave the network .",
    "a service registry should be such that it supports such dynamic and frequent arrival and departure of service providers .",
    "_ r2 : lightweight : _ a service registry designed for mobile environments should be lightweight . a lightweight service registry would complement the power ( i.e. battery ) and computational constraints of mobile devices . furthermore , a lightweight service registry is agile and is easier to integrate with diversified mobile environments .",
    "_ r3 : minimum communication overhead : _ given the battery and network constraints in mobile devices , emphasis should be towards a registry system with minimum communication overhead .",
    "_ r4 : distributed service registry : _ as the number of mobile devices ( and therefore potential web services over these ) are increasing exponentially , a centralized service registry system has limited utility and gets outdated very quickly . hence , a distributed service registry system is required to support scalability .",
    "_ r5 : enabling run time search : _ an important enabler of mobile based service oriented systems is support for run time search .",
    "this is necessary owing to the frequent arrival of new and often more competent services and/or failure of existing services .",
    "conforming to the above points could potentially ensure a service registry suitable for mobile environments .",
    "in mobile based soa environments , each mobile device can perform the functionalities of both a service provider and a service consumer . as a service consumer",
    ", a mobile device discovers web - services and invokes them after negotiating with the providers . as a service provider , a mobile device hosts services and publishes hosted services with service registries .",
    "however , as stated earlier , an effective mobile registry to publish and discover such mobile services in dynamic environments is still lacking .",
    "the mobile services are provided by mobile devices and may be consumed by another mobile device in a peer to peer manner .",
    "our approach suggests a service registry system that comprises a light - weight registry server at each participating mobile device .",
    "the registry at each mobile device contains minimal information that is _ just _ sufficient to uniquely identify the registered entity .",
    "a registry server ( at each mobile device ) manages either of two types of registries :    1 .",
    "service registry : registered mobile services are managed in the service registry . the service registry contains an entry for each service as : _ service name , service access point , service i d , service description , service groups , availability , service location , service provider , other service information_. 2 .   group registry : registered services are categorized into service groups . these service groups are managed in a group registry . the group registry contains the following information for a service group : _ group name , group domain , group description , registrant , groupid , group access point , other group information_.    the organization of registries , as proposed , is shown in figure  [ fig : regent ] .",
    "the service information that is just enough to identify a registered service and that is less likely to change is kept in the registries and service information that is more likely to change but does not affect the discovery process of the service is kept in the vicinity of the provider .",
    "the service binding description , and contextual descriptions are provider specific and are likely to change in the mobile environment .",
    "therefore , these descriptions of the service are kept in close vicinity of the mobile service provider .",
    "close vicinity here implies that the description is hosted on the same mobile device as the service or a third party repository , where these descriptions can be updated rapidly .",
    "we define several registry related operations in section  [ subsec : operation ] that are performed using xml streams .",
    "these xml streams are inspired by xmpp  @xcite ( extensible messaging and presence protocol ) , a well known and established communication protocol .",
    "xmpp is already in wide use in mobile environments in several instant messaging applications .",
    "the proposed approach provides service registry operations that facilitate effective discovery of a service .",
    "details like the non - functional descriptions and quality of service values of the services have deliberately been kept out of the proposed system to make it as lightweight as possible and hence suitable for mobile environments .",
    "there are four primitive steps in the proposed mobile service registry approach that are presented in figure  [ fig : approach ] :    \\1 ) _ mobile service registry access point is retrieved : _ as shown in figure  [ fig : approach].a , a registry requester ( represented by a mobile icon with * m * ) accesses the public registry to retrieve the access point details of mobile service registry .",
    "2 ) _ mobile service registry is accessed via navigator nodes : _ as shown in figure  [ fig : approach].b , the navigator nodes ( represented by mobile icons with * n * ) are contacted for the `` group registry '' .",
    "this group registry contains the list of service groups .",
    "service group of the required service provider is discovered in the group registry .",
    "3 ) _ service group is contacted via registry nodes : _ as shown in figure  [ fig : approach].c , the registry nodes ( represented by mobile icon with * r * ) are accessed via groupid for retrieving the service provider s information .",
    "`` service registry '' is traversed for the required service provider .",
    "4 ) _ the service provider is contacted : _ as shown in the figure 2.d , finally , the required service provider is discovered and it is contacted for service negotiation and service binding .    these steps are discussed in detail in the next subsection .",
    "we first start with the roles performed by the mobile devices .",
    "a mobile device potentially performs the following roles ( as shown in figure  [ fig : approach].a ) : navigator node and registry node .",
    "navigator nodes are the entry points for the mobile registry architecture as shown in figure  [ fig : approach ] .",
    "these navigator nodes are accessible by service consumers via public access points .",
    "we have devised the mobile registry architecture as a service itself .",
    "the mobile registry and its public access points can be registered with any global public registries just to make them globally discoverable ( as shown in figure  [ fig : approach].a ) .",
    "the motive to use global public registry is to provide the access point details of the mobile registry architecture ; mobile devices would need to use the global public registry just once to retrieve the access point details of the architecture .",
    "( these global public registries could be any existing service registries as discussed in section  [ sec : related ] .",
    "these registries are assumed to be well in place , hence is not discussed in detail .",
    "the global public registry is not suitable for mobile services , the reasons are already discussed in section  [ subsec : need ] . ) there can be multiple navigator nodes connected to the public access points via a common access channel , as shown in figure  [ fig : approach].b .",
    "the common access channel can be viewed as a communication bus that enables various mobile devices to communicate .",
    "the common access channel gives mobile devices the liberty to join and leave the network at any time without disturbing other navigator nodes .",
    "whenever a new mobile device joins as a navigator node , the group registry is updated / downloaded via the access channel and the shared domain ontology becomes accessible .",
    "the idea of a common access channel can be realized using existing networking technologies as suggested in rfc1112 and rfc5771 .",
    "navigator nodes are the mobile devices that manage the group registry ( refer figure  [ fig : regent ] ) .",
    "as discussed in the earlier section , the group registry manages service groups .",
    "these service groups are uniquely identified by group identifiers or groupid .",
    "the group registry comprises the list of service groups present in the network along with the respective group identifiers and other group details .",
    "the navigator nodes are further responsible for categorizing the registered services into the various service groups and to navigate the service providers to the assigned service groups .",
    "navigator nodes rely on existing ontological approaches to categorize services on the basis of their domains of offering ( or offered service type ) .",
    "all navigator nodes have access to the shared domain ontologies  @xcite for categorization of the offered services . whenever a service provider needs to register its",
    "offered service , the group registry is referred first for matching the service with its service group . in case the service offered by the provider does not belong to any of the existing service groups , a new service group is created by referring the domain ontology and updating the group registry with a new group entry .",
    "we have used an existing classification method for classifying services into groups  @xcite .",
    "the motivation behind adopting this method is that the method does not require a training set for classification and dynamic changes to the classification parameters is possible without having to retrain the classifier .",
    "this is of particular importance in mobile environments as it provides run time updates to the domain ontology without disturbing the classifiers .",
    "the service group classification method follows generic steps .",
    "first , the mapping criteria are parsed from user supplied service description which is in the textual format . then",
    ", the domain ontology is mapped to the mapping criteria .",
    "the process calculates a matching categorization score of the service description with the ontological context as defined by allahyari et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "for example , the mobile service providers hosting services for : a. ) doctor s rating and b. ) hospital building floor map , share the same service group _ hospital _ , hence they are identified by the same _",
    "groupid_. however a new mobile service provider offering contact information of pizza outlets would fall in a separate service group .",
    "we do not dwell upon the classification approach in this paper .",
    "the interested reader is referred to  @xcite for more details on this .",
    "registry nodes are the mobile devices that manage the service registries ( refer figure  [ fig : regent ] ) .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , a service registry manages the registered services that are uniquely identified by service identifiers .",
    "this enables a service provider to provide multiple services over a single mobile device .",
    "the service registry comprises the list of registered services in a service group , their availability information along with the service details that are just sufficient to manage and identify the registered services .",
    "of these details , the real time availability information of the registered services is what mainly contributes to overcoming the uncertainty of mobile environments .",
    "this availability information managed at the registry node gives the much needed reliability to the services hosted on mobile devices .",
    "registry nodes are responsible for managing the up - to - date service registry , responding to service registry related queries , and performing registry related operations .",
    "the service group can be seen as an overlay group of registered mobile service providers and registry nodes that are identified by the groupid .",
    "we have devised this group identifier as a multi - cast address for the service group members .",
    "the requests sent to the service group are received by all the member mobile service providers , however , only the group member acting as the registry node responds to the requests ( as shown in figure  [ fig : approach].c ) .",
    "to improve query response time , a replica of the service registry that is retrieved from the registry node is managed at all the mobile devices hosting services in the service group .",
    "selective updates are performed to keep the local replica updated . during service discovery ,",
    "the local replica is first referred to , in case discovery fails at the local replica then the registry node is contacted . maintaining replicas of this kind",
    "do add a little overhead to the architecture but in the larger context the local replicas reduce traffic meant for discovery over the network substantially .",
    "further , the local replicas ease the transition of service providers into full fledged registry nodes in the eventuality of a registry node failure ( details on this in the subsequent subsection ) .",
    "mobile devices acting as navigator nodes or registry nodes can also depict uncertain behavior and are prone to failure .",
    "hence , in the case of existing registry node failure , a new registry node can be elected from the member mobile service providers , without compromising on the consistency of other service groups or navigators .",
    "( the same approach is also applied to navigator nodes . )",
    "heartbeat operations are used to detect registry node failure .",
    "any mobile service provider can become a registry node by participating in an election and declaring its candidature .",
    "our method of registry node election is inspired by the leader election problem of distributed computing .",
    "the algorithm is discussed in more detail in section  [ subsec : mobops ] .",
    "_ potential service consumers _ use the proposed mobile registry architecture for discovering their desired services .",
    "this service discovery is a three step process . in the first step as shown in figure  [ fig : approach].b",
    ", the service consumer sends the discovery request to the mobile registry architecture via a well known access point or uri ( uniform resource identifier ) for the desired service .",
    "this request for service discovery is first handled by the navigator node .",
    "the navigator node searches its group registry and provides the matching service group details along with the groupid for the requested service .",
    "groupid _ acts as a multi - casting address for all the service providers that belong to the group . in the second step as shown in figure  [ fig : approach].c , the service consumer contacts the service group using the groupid of the required service .",
    "the registry node of the service group responds with the available matching services and their corresponding service details . in the third step",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : approach].d , service consumer contacts the mobile service provider offering the required service to retrieve the technical description and performs the service negotiation for service access .    _ mobile service providers _ use the proposed mobile registry architecture for registering their offered services .",
    "the service registration process primarily comprises two steps .",
    "first , the mobile service provider sends a service registration request to the mobile registry architecture via the well known access points .",
    "the navigator nodes first handle the registration request and respond with the matching service group along with the groupid and other group details registered in the group registry .",
    "second , the mobile service provider contacts the service group and registers its service with the service registry of the registry node . alternatively ,",
    "if there is no matching service group in the group registry , the navigator node creates a new service group . in this case",
    ", the registrant mobile service provider becomes the registry node of the newly formed service group .",
    "in this section , we describe the operations and functionalities that provide registry operations such as registration , discovery , service updates , and service binding in the proposed architecture .",
    "an inline comparison with uddi is also presented .",
    "the following registry operations make use of several components discussed in an earlier work of ours  @xcite .        in the proposed approach",
    ", we have two types of registrations : 1 ) group registration ( at navigator node ) 2 ) service registration ( at the registry node ) .",
    "these registrations are shown in the figure  [ fig : registerproc ] .    _",
    "group registration : _ the service group is registered in the group registry at the navigator node . a mobile service provider ( registry client )",
    "contacts the mobile registry framework via the navigator node to register the service .",
    "however , if a matching service group is not yet registered in the group registry , a new service group registration request is initiated .",
    "the mobile service provider sends a group registration request to the navigator node along with the service details .",
    "hereafter , the navigator refers the domain ontology and based on the service details , a matching group is mapped .",
    "this matched service group is updated in the group registry along with its groupid .",
    "the registry is then shared among all the navigator nodes .",
    "subsequent to the successful registration process , a `` groupid '' is sent to the newly registered mobile device ( in a ` result ' type iq stanza ) . at this point",
    "the registrant is the registry node of the newly formed service group .",
    "figure  [ fig : registerproc ] shows the group registration process .",

    "hereafter , the registry node receives service related information from the mobile service provider and generates a serviceid for the new service .",
    "the registration process is completed when the information of the new service is updated at the service registry of the registry node .",

    "we quickly discuss the registration process in the traditional uddi registry system so that one can appreciate the significance of the proposed approach . in uddi",
    ", registration is done using the _ publisher apis set _ exposed by the uddi , such as save_service , save_business , save_binding , save_t_model .",
    "these apis are used to save detailed information on the web service , which may not be necessary in case of the mobile based web services .",
    "moreover this information would tend to become heavy for mobile devices to process or transport .",
    "a typical uddi registry  @xcite primarily consists of the following information : businessentity , businessservice , bindingtemplate and tmodels for a registered service .",
    "the information is passed on by the web - service provider to the uddi registry through publisher apis ( the information is transported as xml tags , we are not showing the xml for the uddi structure owing to space constraints here . for the benefit of interested readers",
    ", we have uploaded details on this at : http://goo.gl/cn8vap ) .",
    "deploying such a uddi registry over a mobile device would tend to become heavy owing to the limited computational power and network constraints in mobile devices .",
    "the uddi registry would also significantly lag behind in managing the dynamic nature of mobile devices .",
    "two possible cases are included in the prototype : 1 .",

    "web service discovery in a uddi registry is done via public inquiry apis of the uddi , such as find_service , find_binding , find_business , find_tmodel .",

    "this is because the consumer requests the uddi registry server which in turn does the query search centrally and responds to the consumer with the results .",
    "the complexity and structured nature of the uddi data structure would makes searching tedious were it adopted in a mobile environment .",
    "though traditional uddis enable consumers to query the registry and are effective in a centralized system , they are ill suited to the mobile environments that are mostly distributed .      web service binding information is necessary to call a particular web service .",
    "it includes the technical information on a web service , such as the access endpoint , required parameter values , return type etc . in the proposed architecture , binding information is exchanged directly between the service consumer and the service provider ( as shown in the figure  [ fig : approach].d ) .",
    "the service provider can provide the wsdl / wadl document or it s global url in the binding information as well .",
    "the functional description of the service is kept in the close vicinity of the service provider .",
    "the reason being that the mobile services tend to change frequently and this might result in a change in the technical description of the same .",
    "therefore , a proximal location of the functional description facilitates mobile service providers to readily change the service operations dynamically without violating the service registry information ( figure  [ fig : servicebind ] shows the service binding process ) .",
    "furthermore , other types of descriptions viz .",
    "non - functional , contextual , business descriptions are usually present on the same device as the service provider to keep descriptions up - to - date without increasing traffic over the mobile registry architecture .",
    ".summary of operations performed in proposed approach and uddi . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in our third experiment , we sent ( 50 * 4= ) 200 new service registration requests from other mobile devices and virtual instances to the registry architecture .",
    "figure  [ fig : total ] depicts the total response time behavior for a service provider .",
    "also noteworthy here is the fact that the mobile devices were continuously moving with the volunteers , hence the devices were randomly joining and leaving the network .",
    "therefore , we observed a few outliers in the response time behavior .",
    "we concluded that the average service registration time ( including outliers ) is near 5 seconds which seems acceptable for practical purposes .",
    "the fourth experiment evaluated the effect of directory size on the discovery time .",
    "we registered multiple services in a service group on the registry node . in order to test the scalability of our prototype , we ran service discovery operations for various directory sizes : 500 , 1000 , 5000 , 10000 , 50000 , 100000 .",
    "we discovered that the discovery time increases as the size of the directory increases .",
    "however , in spite of this even with 100000 registered services the query response time was under 1 second which is acceptable for all practical purposes .",
    "we sent service discovery requests from four mobile devices and virtual instances to varied numbers of registered services and the response time was calculated for these requests .",
    "figure  [ fig : scale1 ] shows the average response time for these discovery requests for various registry sizes . through the whole experiment , the mobile device acting as the registry node was moving continuously within the network .",
    "further , the size of the registry increased linearly with the increasing number of registered services .",
    "even with thousands of services registered , the registry size was under 10 mb ( shown in figure  [ fig : scale2 ] ) .",
    "it should be noted here that we made use of sqlite for implementing the service and group registries over android mobile devices .",
    "our fifth experiment aimed at evaluating the feasibility of the proposed approach when running simultaneously with other phone activities . in this experiment",
    ", we conducted a comparative study on the difference in response time for the service discovery requests a ) when a volunteer was answering a phone call and , b ) when the device was idle .",
    "for this experiment , we sent 50 requests for group discovery to the volunteer s mobile device .",
    "first , we observed the response behavior when the device was idle in the volunteer s pocket . during this phase the volunteer was randomly moving within the network",
    "the response time behavior during this period is shown in figure  [ fig : wocall ] .",
    "next , we made a phone call on the volunteer s mobile phone and observed the response time during the call .",
    "the results demonstrate that there is a change in response time , but this change is well within acceptable limits .",
    "response time behavior during the call is shown in figure  [ fig : call ] .",
    "there is an initial peak in the response time when the call is made . from the initial results ,",
    "we conclude that the mobile device takes a little time to respond to the first discovery request .",
    "this is due to the fact that some processing time is required to  _ awaken _ the sleeping mobile application .",
    "we feel , therefore , that  _ piggybacking of incoming requests _ could be a good approach to reduce the energy overhead .",
    "the sixth experiment involved an evaluation of the reliability of the approach .",
    "we toggled the availability status of the service provider from  _ available _ to  _ unavailable _ and back to  _ available _ with a time difference of 10 seconds .",
    "these toggles were repeated 120 times at the registry node . during this time",
    ", we continuously probed the registry node from the service consumers to get the status of the service provider .",
    "the initial results shown by the experiment have less than 1% false negative , where false negative implies - registry node returns availability information as  _ available _ when the service provider has updated it to  _ unavailable _ and vice versa .",
    "although the scale of these experiments was limited , the results were promising",
    ". it will be interesting to explore the performance of this approach for a much larger number of service providers , and registry clients and for much longer durations ( a few days ) .",
    "( interested readers may refer to https://goo.gl/4vg895 for further details about the architecture and experimental setup . )",
    "nonetheless , we present the speculated trend of our experiments with a large number of devices :    1 .",
    "effects on battery : with increasing number of devices there would be more numbers of registry requests and responses ; hence more battery power would be needed . however , in such scenarios the service groups and navigator nodes would play a crucial role .",
    "more specialized service groups would be formed as suggested in section  [ subsec : concept ] , this would keep the number of devices in a service group within limits in turn keeping the battery usage in check ( irrespective of any number of registered services ) .",
    "effects on data exchange : with increasing number of devices there would be more exchange of data .",
    "however , the split service groups would keep a check on the data exchange .",
    "further , keeping in view the current data usage by modern smartphones , the data usage by large number of devices should be in acceptable limits .",
    "effects on service registration time : we believe that with increasing number of devices and service registrations , the response time would increase but would be well within the accepted range . also , this is a onetime process for a service",
    ", it would be acceptable for all practical purposes .",
    "effects on service discovery time : figure  [ fig : scale1 ] shows the discovery time for a large number of registered services varying from one thousand to a few hundreds thousand .",
    "this is still within acceptable limits .",
    "5 .   effects on registry size : the registry size will increase linearly for increasing number of register services .",
    "trend is shown in the figure  [ fig : scale2 ] . while other experiments are dependent on the individual mobile device without depending on the other device s behavior .",
    "further , the effects of other contextual parameters on increasing number of devices ( e.g. network , isp , terrain , carrier type etc . ) would be interesting to look into but unfortunately these are not within the scope of current focus .",
    "the proposed architecture caters to the issues of providing a dynamic service registry in mobile environments .",
    "it manage to incorporate the requirements outlined in section  [ sec : req ] .",
    "_ r1 : management of transient web services : _ the approach effectively manages the availability information on each registered web service and is capable of dynamically updating it .",
    "this helps in satisfying requirement  _ r1 _ and keeping the service registry up - to - date irrespective of random entry and exit of transient web services .",
    "_ r2 : lightweight : _ the architecture seeks information that is just enough to uniquely identify and manage a web service from the registrant mobile device for registry related operations .",
    "the registries manage information that is less likely to change and whatever change does happen is updatable via a watchdog process .",
    "this keeps the registry architecture as lightweight as possible and thus satisfies requirement  _",
    "r2_.    _ r3 : minimum communication overhead : _ we have made use of just three xml stanzas in order to minimize communication overhead , satisfying requirement  _",
    "r3_. during our experiments , we observed the exchange of just a few kilobytes of data for hundreds of request transfers .",
    "this small overhead also helped us minimize battery utilization , as reflected in table  [ table : power ] and  [ table : network ] .",
    "furthermore , the approach uses just one stanza `` iq stanza '' for easier service registration and de - registration .",
    "_ r4 : distributed service registry : _ the proposed approach manages the service registry over dispersed registry nodes and navigator nodes . thus satisfying requirement  _ r4 _ and improving fault localization . these features ,",
    "contribute to a light weight and autonomous service registry effective for mobile environments .",
    "_ r5 : run time search : _ the dynamic availability information , minimal data transfer , and faster response time helped in performing effective run time searches and in the process satisfied requirement  _",
    "r5_.    further , the proposed dynamic mobile service registry is compatible with existing uddi and other registries .",
    "the dynamic registry can register external uddi and other service registries as one of the registered services along with their access points .",
    "contrary the proposed registry can be registered with other registries and uddi as any of the registered service .",
    "there are certain important assumptions that have been made in the proposed service registry framework .",
    "these are listed as follows : 1 ) the load balancing of the incoming registry requests is assumed to be handled at the device level",
    ". there could be a threshold capacity limit , at each device depending on its hardware capacity . on exceeding this capacity limit ,",
    "the incoming requests are not entertained and these surplus requests are handled by other registry nodes that have access to the common access channel .",
    "2 ) there is no reward system suggested in the current state of the work .",
    "hence , it is assumed that the mobile device owners are self - motivated to provide their respective devices for serving as the registry .",
    "we may look into a system of rewards / incentive as part of future work .",
    "3 ) the updates are performed to keep the local registry replica updated ( at the navigator / registry nodes ) in an automated manner without manual intervention",
    ".    a few important limitations of the current work are listed as follows : a ) the current design of the framework does not deal with the privacy issues of the mobile phone users associated with service registry and service provisioning .",
    "b ) the current design of the mobile registry does not handle the qos ( quality of service ) aspect of the mobile web service .",
    "the qos may be handled by providing a link to the data server ( external to the framework ) that could have qos and other details on the service description .",
    "c ) though we have a system in place to detect the unavailability of registry nodes through heartbeat signals , the behavior of the mobile device owner , poor network connectivity , and physical damage to the mobile device could result in the abrupt unavailability of the registry / navigator node .",
    "these have not been dealt with in this work .",
    "d ) finally , the current evaluation of the approach was conducted within a supervised lab environment .",
    "the registry power and data requirements , service discovery performance , and other results were therefore well within acceptable range",
    ". there could be slight variations in these if the experiments were carried out at a much larger scale including thousands of mobile devices .",
    "service discovery is an important aspect of service - oriented architecture .",
    "two types of approaches are primarily adopted for service discovery : registry based approach and registry - less approach .",
    "the registry - less approach usually makes use of overlay networks , hash tables , and other broadcasting / multi - casting techniques . in the proposed work ,",
    "we perform service discovery using the former i.e. `` registry based approach '' .",
    "we surveyed existing literature from the late 90 s .",
    "we classified the registry based approach into two broad categories : the centralized registry approach and the distributed registry approach .",
    "these two can further be classified into those for mobile environments and those for non - mobile environment .",
    "our survey includes works from the areas of soa , peer - to - peer networking , mobile ad - hoc networking .",
    "the centralized service registry approach is used in several popular technologies : service location protocols  @xcite , sun s jini architecture  @xcite , service discovery services  @xcite , microsoft s universal plug and play ( upnp )  @xcite .",
    "these service discovery infrastructures rely on a central registry for discovering capable services .",
    "the service information is stored at a centralized registry .",
    "all registry related operations are performed by a single entity .",
    "one well known example of centralized service registry architecture for web services is uddi ( universal description discovery and integration )  @xcite .",
