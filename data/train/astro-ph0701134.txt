    "the universal shape of the spherically averaged density profile of relaxed dark halos in high - resolution @xmath0-body  simulations is considered one of the major predictions of standard cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmologies . down to 1 % of the virial radius @xmath1 , it is well fitted by the so - called nfw profile @xcite , @xmath2 specified by only one mass - dependent parameter , the scale radius @xmath3 or equivalently the concentration @xmath4 .    at radii smaller than 1 % of the virial radius",
    ", however , the behavior of the density profile is unknown . on the basis of recent numerical simulations ,",
    "some authors advocate a central asymptotic slope significantly steeper ( moore et al . 1998 ; jing & suto 2000 ) or shallower @xcite than that of the nfw law .",
    "others suggest an ever decreasing absolute value of the logarithmic slope @xcite , which might tend to zero as a power of the radius as in the three - dimensional ( 3d ) srsic ( 1968 ) or einasto ( einasto & haud 1989 ) laws @xcite .",
    "this uncertainty is the consequence of the fact that the origin of such a universal profile is poorly understood .",
    "two extreme points of view have been envisaged . in one of these ,",
    "it would be caused by repeated significant mergers @xcite , while in the other it would be essentially the result of smooth accretion or secondary infall @xcite .",
    "the fact that the @xmath5 relation at @xmath6 is consistent ( salvador - sol et al .  1998 , @xcite ) with the idea that all halos emerge from major mergers with similar values of @xmath7 , which then decreases according to the inside - out growth of halos during the subsequent accretion phase , seems to favor an important role of mergers .",
    "however , the purely accretion - driven scenario is at least as attractive , as the inside - out growth during accretion leads to a typical density profile that appears roughly to have the nfw shape with the correct @xmath5 relation in any epoch and cosmology analyzed ( manrique et al .",
    "2003 , hereafter m03 ) .",
    "certainly the effects of major mergers can not be neglected in hierarchical cosmologies , so both major mergers and accretion should contribute in shaping relaxed halos . however , as noted by m03 , if the density profile arising from a major merger were set by the boundary conditions imposed by _ current _ accretion ,",
    "then the density profile of halos would appear to be independent of their past aggregation history , so halos could be assumed to grow by pure accretion without any loss of generality .",
    "all the correlations shown by relaxed halos in numerical simulations can be recovered under this point of view @xcite .",
    "simultaneously , this would explain why halos with very different initial conditions and aggregation histories have similar density profiles ( @xcite ) .    in the present paper ,",
    "we show that the m03 model relies on two basic assumptions , namely , ( 1 ) that halos grow inside out in periods of smooth accretion , and ( 2 ) that the mass profile and all its derivatives are continuous functions .",
    "the former assumption is supported by the results of numerical simulations ( @xcite ) , while the second one is at least not in contradiction with them . in the present paper",
    "we show that both assumptions are in fact sound from a theoretical point of view , as they can be related to the very nature of cdm .",
    "this renders the predictions of the model beyond the range of current simulations worth examining in detail , as is done below .    for simplicity , we consider spherical structures , which at best is an approximation to the triaxial structures observed in numerical simulations .",
    "secondary infall is known to be influenced by deviations from spherical symmetry @xcite .",
    "yet , in an accompanying paper @xcite , we show that this does not seem to affect the fundamental role of the two assumptions given above .",
    "another simplifying assumption used here is the neglect of substructure .",
    "it has recently been shown in high - resolution simulations that about 57 % of the halo mass is collected in the previous major merger @xcite .",
    "however , substructures ( and sub - substructures ) contribute only about 5 % of the total mass in halos @xcite whose density profile is well described by equation ( [ nfw ] ) .",
    "it seems therefore a good first approximation to ignore substructure .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  [ rev ] ,",
    "we show how the m03 model emerges from the properties of standard cdm .",
    "the behavior of the predicted density profile at extremely small radii and for a wide range of halo masses is investigated in  [ dens ] .",
    "our results are summarized in  [ sum ] .",
    "we now argue that halos grow inside out during accretion , as is indeed found in numerical simulations , because of some properties of cdm ; in particular , its characteristic power spectrum , leading to a slow halo accretion rate . as shown in ",
    "[ boundary ] , this has important consequences for the inner structure of these objects .",
    "schematically , one can distinguish between minor and major mergers . in minor mergers ,",
    "the relative mass increase produced , @xmath8 , is so small that the system is left essentially unaltered , whereas in major mergers @xmath9 is large enough to cause rearrangements .",
    "relation at @xmath6 predicted in the concordance model by the m03 model for @xmath10 ( _ solid line _ ) compared to the empirical relation traced by those points , with minimal error bars obtained by @xcite from high - resolution simulations ( _ triangles with error bars_).,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the smaller the value of @xmath9 , the most frequent the mergers @xcite .",
    "for this reason , although individual minor mergers do not affect the structure of halos , their added contribution yields a @xmath11 secular mass increase , the so - called accretion , with apparent effects on the aggregation track @xmath12 of the halo .",
    "the accretion - scaled rate , @xmath13 , is given by ( @xcite , hereafter rgs01 )",
    "@xmath14 where @xmath15 is the usual lacey - cole @xcite instantaneous merger rate ( see eq .",
    "[ [ mrate ] ] ) and @xmath16 is the maximum value of @xmath9 for mergers contributing to accretion . in contrast , less frequent major mergers yield notable sudden mass increases or _ discontinuities _ in @xmath12 .    after undergoing a major merger ( and virializing ) ,",
    "halos evolve as relaxed systems until the next major merger .",
    "the fact that standard cdm is _ nondecaying and non - self - annihilating _ guarantees that the mass collected during such periods is conserved .",
    "this does not yet imply that halos grow inside out during accretion , because their mass distribution might still vary due to energy gains or losses or to the action of accretion itself .",
    "even if each individual minor merger would leave the halo unchanged their collective action might alter these systems .",
    "however , standard cdm is also _ dissipationless _ and therefore halos can not loose energy .",
    "furthermore , under the assumption of spherical symmetry halos can not suffer tidal torques from surrounding matter , and hence the surrounding matter is unable to alter the kinetic energy of the halo .",
    "therefore , the only possibility for a time - varying inner mass distribution of accreting halos is that the accretion process causes it itself .",
    "this possibility , that the process of accretion itself could alter the internal mass distribution , would be realized only if the accretion time @xmath17 were smaller than the dynamical time @xmath18 . on the contrary , if @xmath17 is substantially larger than @xmath18 , the adiabatic invariance of the inner halo structure will be guaranteed , and the halo will evolve inside out .",
    "thus , by requiring @xmath17 to be @xmath19 times larger than @xmath18 , we are led to the equation @xmath20^{1/2}= { { \\cal r}_{\\rm a}}(m , t)\\ , , \\label{cond}\\ ] ] which gives the upper mass @xmath21 for inside - out growth at @xmath22 . in equation ( [ cond ] ) , @xmath23 is the mean cosmic density and @xmath24 is the virialization density contrast given e.g. by @xcite . here",
    "@xmath21 is indeed an upper limit because @xmath25 is an increasing function of @xmath22 ; see rgs01 . in any cdm cosmology analyzed , equation ( [ cond ] ) appears to have no solution for values of @xmath19 significantly larger than unity in the relevant redshift range .",
    "this means that accretion is always slow enough for halos to grow inside out , as required by the m03 model .",
    "as previously mentioned , the inside - out growth of halos in accreting periods is unambiguously confirmed by the results of @xmath0-body  simulations ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is also consistent with the fact that dark matter structures preserve the memory of initial conditions , in the sense that the most initially overdense regions end up being the central regions of the final structures @xcite , implying that the spatial positions of particles are not significantly perturbed by merging / accretion during the assembly of the structures .",
    "likewise , the energy of the individual particles in the final structure ( at @xmath6 ) is very strongly correlated with their energies at much earlier times ( @xmath26 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this shows that particles even preserve the memory of the initial energies .",
    "contrarily to an ordinary fluid , cdm is _ collisionless _ and _ free - streaming _ and , hence , can not support discontinuities ( shock fronts ) in the spatial distribution of any of its macroscopic properties . as a consequence ,",
    "all radial profiles in relaxed halos are necessarily smooth .",
    "this holds in particular for the mass profile , @xmath27 , and its radial derivatives , which has the following consequence .",
    "the inside - out growth of a halo during accretion (  [ relform ] ) implies that the mass profile @xmath27 built at that interval is the simple conversion , through the definition of the instantaneous virial radius @xmath28^{1/3}\\ , , \\label{r}\\ ] ] of the associated mass aggregation track @xmath12 .",
    "the smoothness condition implies that the old @xmath27 profile must match perfectly with the new part of the profile built during that time .",
    "since minor mergers only cause tiny discontinuities , the new piece of the @xmath12 track that they produce is well approximated by a smooth function , and , as the functions @xmath29 and @xmath24 in equation ( [ r ] ) are also smooth functions , the corresponding piece of the @xmath27 profile automatically fulfills the right smoothness condition .",
    "thus , the system can grow , during accretion , without the need to essentially rearrange its structure .",
    "only when a halo undergoes a major merger and its @xmath12 track suffers a marked discontinuity will the mass profile prior to the major merger no longer match the piece that begins to develop after it . since the @xmath27 profile can not have any discontinuities , the halo",
    "is then forced to rearrange its mass distribution ( through violent relaxation ) to fulfill the required smooth condition .    in other words ,",
    "the fundamental assumption of the m03 model that the mass distribution of relaxed halos is determined by their current accretion rate ( through dramatic rearrangements of the structure on the occasion of major mergers and very tiny and negligible ones during accretion periods ) , is simply the natural consequence of the slowly accreting , nondecaying , nonself - annihilating , dissipationless , and collisionless nature of standard cdm .      the mass profile of a specific halo with mass @xmath30 at time @xmath31 accreting at a given rate during any arbitrarily small time interval @xmath32 around @xmath31 is therefore simply the smooth extension inward of the small piece of profile being built during that interval .",
    "unfortunately , the smooth extension of a small piece of a function is hard to find in practice , so the mass profiles of real individual halos can hardly be obtained in this way .",
    "there is one case , however , in which such a smooth extension can readily be achieved : that of halos with @xmath30 at @xmath31 _ accreting at the typical cosmological rate _",
    "@xmath33 during any arbitrarily small interval of time around @xmath31 . in this case , the ( unique ) smooth extension we are looking for necessarily coincides with the smooth function @xmath12 , the solution of the differential equation @xmath34 for the boundary condition @xmath35 , properly converted from @xmath22 to @xmath36 by means of equation ( [ r ] ) . once the typical @xmath27 profile is known , by differentiating it and taking into account equations ( [ r ] ) and ( [ mtrack ] ) , one is led to the _ typical density profile for halos with @xmath30 at @xmath31 _ proposed by m03 , @xmath37_{t(r ) } \\label{rhot}\\ ] ]    @xmath38^{-1}\\,.\\label{delta}\\ ] ]     and @xmath39 parameters obtained in the concordance model [ sghown with solid lines for masses up to @xmath40 and dashed lines beyond it ] from the fits of the theoretical density profiles of halos with varying mass at the redshifts @xmath41 , 1.03 , 2.08 , and 3.94 .",
    "the dot - dashed line gives the analytical fit ( see text ) to the mean of the solid lines.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    from equations ( [ rhot ] ) and ( [ delta ] ) we see that the shape of this profile is ultimately set by the cdm power spectrum of density perturbations in the cosmology considered through the merger rate @xmath15 used to calculate the accretion rate @xmath25 ( see eqs .  [ [ mrate ] ] and [ [ accrate ] ] ) .",
    "this dependence is , however , so convoluted that the density profile ( eq . [ [ rhot ] ] ) must be inferred numerically . only its central asymptotic behavior can be derived analytically , as will be shown in the next section .",
    "from equation ( [ accrate ] ) we see that the exact shape of the density profile in equation ( [ rhot ] ) depends on @xmath16 .",
    "this parameter marks the effective transition between minor and major mergers , and it can be determined from the empirical @xmath5 relation at some given redshift .    for each given @xmath16 value , the density profiles , down to @xmath42 , predicted at @xmath6 in the concordance model characterized by @xmath43 for halos with different masses have been fitted to the nfw profile to find the best - fit values of @xmath7 .",
    "then we searched for the value of @xmath16 that minimizes the departure of the theoretical @xmath5 relations from the empirical one drawn from high - resolution simulations by @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure [ fit ] , @xmath10 gives an excellent fit over almost 4 decades in mass ( @xmath44 ) .        in figure [ nfw ] ,",
    "we plot , down to a radius equal to the current resolution radius of most numerical simulations , the density profiles predicted in the concordance model for halo masses at @xmath6 ranging from @xmath45 to @xmath46 .",
    "they are all well fitted to a nfw profile , although there is a tendency for the theoretical profiles for @xmath47 to deviate from that shape and approach a power law with logarithmic slope intermediate between the nfw asymptotic values of @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "this tendency also makes @xmath7 increase very rapidly at large masses where the fit by the nfw law is no longer acceptable .",
    "this causes the @xmath5 relation to deviate from its regular trend at smaller values of @xmath50 ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "both effects , already reported in m03 , were later observed in simulated halos @xcite .",
    "this is a clear indication that the nfw profile does not provide an optimal fit for very massive structures . of course , above 10@xmath51 halos are hardly in virial equilibrium , so such a deviation has essentially no practical effects .    as explained in @xcite , another interesting consequence of the m03 model",
    "is that the @xmath12 tracks traced by accreting halos ( hence , growing inside out ) coincide with curves of constant @xmath3- and @xmath39- values , with @xmath39 defined as the mass interior to @xmath3 .",
    "thus , the intersection of those accretion tracks at any arbitrary redshift sets the relation @xmath52 between such a couple of parameters , implying that the @xmath52 relation satisfied by halos is _ time - invariant_. in figure [ ms - rs ] , we show how the different @xmath52 curves obtained by fitting the density profiles predicted at different redshifts to a nfw law overlap .",
    "there is only some deviation at large masses , where the density profiles are not correctly described by the nfw profile .",
    "such a time - invariant @xmath52 relation is well fitted , for @xmath3 in the range @xmath53 , by @xmath54 substituting equation ( [ rel0 ] ) into the relation @xmath55 which holds for nfw profiles , one is led to @xmath56^{0.82}\\!\\left[\\frac{m}{10^{13}\\,m_\\odot}\\right]^{0.18}\\!\\!\\!= \\frac{g(c)}{c^{2.45}}\\ , , \\label{rel}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 stands for @xmath58 and @xmath59 is the current mean cosmic density .",
    "equation ( [ rel ] ) is an implicit equation for the concentration of halos with any given mass and redshift .",
    "what about the central behavior of the predicted density profile ? according to equation ( [ r ] ) , small radii correspond to small cosmic times .",
    "in this asymptotic regime , all friedman cosmologies approach the einstein@xmath60de sitter model in which @xmath24 is constant and @xmath61 is ( in the matter - dominated era when halos form ) proportional to @xmath62 .",
    "if the power spectrum of density perturbations were of the power - law form @xmath63 , with the index @xmath64 satisfying @xmath65 to guarantee hierarchical clustering , then the universe would be self - similar .",
    "the mass accretion in equation ( [ mtrack ] ) would take the asymptotic form : @xmath66 ( see the appendix ) .",
    "the fact that both @xmath67 and @xmath12 would then be power laws has two consequences .",
    "first , the time dependence of their respective logarithmic derivatives on the right - hand side of equation ( [ delta ] ) cancel , which implies that @xmath68 is proportional to @xmath67 , and hence to @xmath29 .",
    "second , the virial radius given by equation ( [ r ] ) is also a power law , @xmath69^{1/3}\\propto t^{2(j+4)/[3(j+3)]}.$ ] from this we get @xmath70 , and thereby one finds @xmath71 this central behavior , fully in agreement with the numerical profiles obtained from power - law power spectra , is particularly robust , as it does not depend on @xmath16 .",
    "note that it coincides with the solution derived in self - similar cosmologies by @xcite assuming spherical collapse .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that in that derivation , such an asymptotic behavior is restricted to @xmath72 so as to warrant the required adiabatic invariance @xcite , while , in the present derivation , there is no such a restriction as the central density profile is not assumed to be built by spherical infall , but results instead from smooth adaptation to the boundary condition imposed by current accretion .",
    "the cdm power spectrum is , of course , not a power law .",
    "however , in the limit of small masses involved in that asymptotic regime , it tends to a power law of index @xmath73 .",
    "thus , according to equation ( [ asrho ] ) , we expect a vanishing central logarithmic slope of @xmath74 for the standard cdm case .",
    "this is confirmed by the numerical profiles obtained in this case : as one goes deeper and deeper into the halo center , they become increasingly shallower .",
    "what is still more remarkable is that down to a radius as small as 1 pc , the density profiles appear to be well fitted by the 3d srsic or einasto law @xmath75\\ , , \\label{new}\\ ] ] over at least 10 decades in halo mass ( see fig .  [ sersic ] ) , from @xmath76 to @xmath46 .",
    "we remind the reader that for power - law spectra , equation ( [ rhot ] ) leads to density profiles with central cusps , so the srsic shape is not a general consequence of the m03 model , but it is specific to the standard cdm power spectrum .",
    "in fact , from the reasoning above we see that what causes the zero central logarithmic slope in the cdm case is the fact that the logarithmic accretion rate @xmath77 diverges in the limit of small values of @xmath22 .",
    "this is in contrast to the general power - law case , where the accretion rate remains finite .     of the srsic law parameters @xmath78 and @xmath79 fitting the predicted density profiles of halos in the concordance model ( _ solid lines _ ) and their fits by the simple expressions given in the text ( _ dashed lines_).,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    similar to the characteristic density @xmath80 in the nfw profile ( eq .  [ [ nfw ] ] ) , the central density @xmath81 entering the 3d srsic law ( eq .  [ [ new ] ] ) can be written in terms of the mass @xmath50 and the values of the two ( instead of one ) remaining parameters , @xmath78 and either @xmath82 or @xmath83 : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the usual gamma function and @xmath86 is the incomplete or regularized one . at @xmath6 ,",
    "the two free parameters @xmath78 and @xmath79 depend on @xmath50 according to the relations plotted in figure [ m - cn ] , which are well approximated by @xmath87^{4.6}\\ , , \\label{nm}\\ ] ] @xmath88=13.3 + 7.5\\times 10^{-8}\\left[\\ln\\left(\\frac{m}{{~m_\\odot}}\\right)\\right]^{5.6}\\ , , \\label{cnm}\\ ] ] leading to the following combined relation @xmath89 these expressions can be used to infer the typical values of the srsic parameters for present - day halos with any mass .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the predicted values of @xmath78 are of the same order of magnitude as the ones obtained by @xcite from simulated halos with masses ranging from dwarf galaxies to galaxy clusters ( the values of @xmath79 were not presented in that work ) .",
    "but for the @xmath90 and @xmath91 relations among the best - fit srsic parameters . the respective analytical fits ( see text ) to the mean curve are shown in dot - dashed lines . here",
    "@xmath92 is the current mean cosmic density.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    to obtain more general values of these parameters for halos of any mass and redshift , we can proceed as in the nfw case above . for reasons identical to the ones leading to the time - invariant relation @xmath52 , the relations @xmath90 and @xmath91 must be time - invariant . in figure [ sersic2 ]",
    ", we see how the corresponding curves obtained from the fit to the srsic profile of the same density profiles as used in figure [ ms - rs ] overlap , indeed , even better than the @xmath52 curves do , since there are no large deviations at large masses .",
    "these invariant relations are well fitted , for @xmath93 in the range @xmath94 , by @xmath95 @xmath96 replacing these expressions into equation ( [ norm ] ) , we can solve for @xmath82 and then use the equation ( [ r2 ] ) to find the value of @xmath78 .",
    "this provides a very concrete prediction that can be tested with numerical simulations .",
    "one can take the very strong correlation shown in figure [ sersic2 ] , which allows one to fit the density profile of any dark matter structure with only two free parameters : e.g. @xmath78 and @xmath81 . with this value of @xmath78 ( purely from the _ shape _ of the density profile ) ,",
    "one now gets a value for the mass ( from fig .  [ m - cn ] ) .",
    "this mass can trivially be compared to the true virial mass ( which is naturally known in the simulation ) , and hence one can confirm or reject the prediction of the accretion - driven model .",
    "we have shown how the basic properties of standard cdm can justify the m03 model , which was previously shown to be in overall agreement with the results of numerical simulations . in this model ,",
    "the density profile of relaxed halos permanently adapts to the profile currently building up through accretion and does not depend on their past aggregation history . as a consequence ,",
    "the typical density profile of halos of a given mass at a given epoch is set by their time - evolving cosmology - dependent typical accretion rates .",
    "although halos have been assumed to be spherically symmetric throughout the present paper , this is not crucial for the m03 model . as will be shown in a following paper ( gonzlez - casado et al .",
    "2007 ) , the results presented here also hold for more realistic triaxial rotating halos .",
    "furthermore , an approach similar to the one followed here allows one to explain not only their mass distribution , but also others of their structural and kinematic properties , such as the radial dependence of angular momentum .    according to the m03 model , the central asymptotic behavior of the halo density profile depends , through the typical accretion rate , on the power spectrum of density perturbations . the prediction made in the case of power - law spectra should be possible to check by means of numerical simulations , provided one concentrates on massive halos , as these reach the asymptotic regime at larger radii . in the case of the standard cdm power spectrum ,",
    "the model predicts a vanishing central logarithmic slope .",
    "the way this asymptotic behavior is reached is surprisingly simple : down to a radius as small as 1 pc , the density profile is well fitted by the 3d srsic or einasto profile over at least 10 decades in halo mass .",
    "another consequence of the m03 model with useful practical applications is the existence of time - invariant relations among the nfw or 3d srsic law parameters ( @xmath39 and @xmath3 in the former case and @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath78 in the latter ) fitting the halo density profiles .",
    "a code is publicly available that computes such invariant relations for any desired standard cdm cosmology .",
    "some of these consequences can be readily tested by numerical simulations or by ( x - ray or strong - lensing ) observations , which should allow one to confirm or reject the prediction for the central behavior of the density profile of halos that is made by the m03 model .",
