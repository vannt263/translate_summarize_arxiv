    "in the past 15 years , the search for class  0 protostellar objects has yielded only @xmath7100 unambiguous sources @xcite .",
    "class  0 sources , which display a high ratio of submillimeter to bolometric luminosity , often remain undetectable in the near - ir , and show bolometric temperatures of 80 k or less @xcite .",
    "an assortment of recent observations concentrating on the core of the r corona australis molecular cloud ( r  cra ) has revealed sources that could be class  0 objects .",
    "r  cra is an ideal laboratory for the study of low mass star formation because at a distance of @xmath7170 pc , it is one of the nearest examples of this activity @xcite . as a result ,",
    "observations have high physical resolution ( 170 au per arcsecond ) when compared to more distant star forming regions .",
    "while images with the chandra x - ray observatory and the vla have been able to resolve individual sources in the r  cra region , work in the ( sub)millimeter band has been limited to single dish telescopes , with @xmath8 resolution .",
    "nevertheless , the proximity of r  cra has allowed even moderate resolution studies to reveal ( sub)millimeter sources in the region that have no near - ir counterparts @xcite .",
    "early single - dish observations of this region with a @xmath9 beam identified a molecular cloud core containing the emission line star r  cra @xcite .",
    "later observations of c@xmath10o with a @xmath11 beam resolved this core into multiple components @xcite . observing with a @xmath12 beam , @xcite attributed the bulk of the long wavelength dust continuum emission to the deeply embedded near - ir source irs7 @xcite .",
    "a molecular outflow approximately centered on irs7 has been known for many years ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and others ) , and is an indicator of protostellar activity .",
    "more recent work by @xcite with the jcmt at 850 @xmath3 m and 450 @xmath3 m has begun to disentangle the submillimeter emission into numerous sources in the vicinity of irs7 .",
    "it is now clear that irs7 is unlikely to be the powering source of this long wavelength dust emission .",
    "the submillimeter sources smm1b and smm1c @xcite are associated with two centimeter continuum point sources @xcite .",
    "these centimeter sources are also detected in the x - ray by @xcite , with properties suggestive of class  0 or very young class  i objects .",
    "clearly , millimeter or submillimeter interferometric observations are necessary to unambiguously identify the young , embedded protostellar sources in the region .",
    "we have observed the central region of the r cra molecular cloud with the submillimeter array ( sma ) on mauna kea , hawaii in both continuum ( 1.1 mm ) and spectroscopic ( hco@xmath0 j = @xmath1 ) mode , with the goal of spatially resolving and characterizing the class  0 and class  i protostellar candidates in the region . in this paper , we combine the high spatial resolution sma images with archival spitzer irac and mips photometry , jcmt 850 @xmath3 m and 450 @xmath3 m maps and @xmath2co j = @xmath13 outflow maps of moderate spatial resolution in order to more clearly reveal two young protostellar objects in the vicinity of irs7 .",
    "our observations range in linear resolution from 0.02  pc to 0.001  pc .",
    "r cra irs7 ( , ) was observed with the sma on two occasions .",
    "the first track was taken on may 23 , 2004 with a somewhat extended array configuration , with pads 1 , 7 , 8 , 11 , and 23 used .",
    "the zenith opacity at 225  ghz as measured with the tipping radiometer at the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) ranged from 0.14 to 0.20 during the observations .",
    "the tuning was chosen to place the hco@xmath0 j = @xmath1 line ( 267.557619  ghz ) in correlator chunk 3 of the lower sideband with @xmath14 = + 6 km  s@xmath15 ( corresponding to a local oscillator setting of 271.77  ghz ) .",
    "the spectral resolution was 256 channels per correlator chunk ( 0.312  mhz , or 0.35 km  s@xmath15 per channel ) .",
    "uranus and neptune were observed for bandpass and flux calibration , while the quasar j1924 - 292 ( 5.5 jy ) was used as the primary gain calibrator and pointing source .",
    "the uv data span 8 to 100 @xmath16 , with the greatest coverage between @xmath720 and 60 @xmath16 .",
    "the primary beamsize was 46 .",
    "the second track of data was taken on october 4 , 2004 in the compact - north configuration , with antennas on pads 1 , 5 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 12 and 16 .",
    "seven of the eight antennas provided usable data for this track .",
    "these data were taken in a hybrid resolution mode with 512 channels per chunk ( 0.156 mhz , 0.18 km  s@xmath15 ) for the hco@xmath0 j = @xmath1 correlator chunk , and 128 channels ( 0.625 mhz , 0.70 km  s@xmath15 ) for all other chunks . in an attempt to detect the source smm1a ,",
    "a second source position was observed one half of a primary beam south of irs7 .",
    "the calibration sources and observing strategies were otherwise identical to the first track .",
    "these data were calibrated and reduced with the miriad software package with extensions for the sma using the procedures outlined in @xcite .",
    "the continuum data were constructed using all the line - free `` chunks '' of the correlator to produce images for the north and south pointings .",
    "the south pointing was not added into the final image , because no source was detected .",
    "the continuum data were inverted to the image domain using uniform weighting , then cleaned using a gain of 0.08 with 2500 iterations .",
    "an rms noise of 9  mjy / beam was achieved .",
    "the synthesized beam is 42 @xmath17 17 ( @xmath18  au ) with a position angle ( p.a . ) of 27@xmath19 .",
    "we estimate the absolute astrometric uncertainty to be 03 and the flux scale uncertainty to be 20% .",
    "the spectrometer `` chunk '' with the hco@xmath0 j = @xmath1 line was extracted from the data of the two tracks and independently processed .",
    "the data from the second track were binned to match the spectral resolution of the first track prior to processing .",
    "the data were then calibrated and reduced in a similar fashion to the continuum data . inversion to the image domain was performed with natural weighting for maximum sensitivity .",
    "cleaning was performed with a gain of 0.08 and 2500 iterations . as with the continuum",
    ", no line emission was detected in the southern pointing .",
    "the @xmath2co j = @xmath1 data for this work was taken with the 10 m heinrich hertz telescope at mt .",
    "graham , az during april , 2006 with the desertstar 7 beam heterodyne array receiver @xcite .",
    "5@xmath17 5  maps centered on irs7 were taken in the on - the - fly ( otf ) observing mode , using the facility 1 mhz resolution filter bank spectrometers .",
    "eight otf maps were made over the course of the run , and later coadded .",
    "the spectral resolution is 0.87 km  s@xmath15 , with a spatial resolution of 23 .",
    "hot - sky calibrations were done once per row , with cold load calibrations done once per map .",
    "data were gridded and combined based on rms weighting using the class software package .",
    "the intensities of each pixel were scaled using their measured main beam efficiency before combining .",
    "further analysis was performed using the idl package .",
    "the 850 @xmath3 m and 450 @xmath3 m continuum observations were obtained with bolometer array scuba on jcmt , mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "scuba @xcite has 37 bolometers in the long and 91 in the short wavelength array separated by approximately two beam widths in a hexagonal pattern .",
    "the field of view of both arrays is @xmath723 .",
    "both arrays can be used simultaneously by means of a dichroic beamsplitter .",
    "the scuba observations reported in this paper were all obtained in jiggle - map mode @xcite with chop throws of 120  - 150  in azimuth .",
    "because the r  cra cloud complex is rather extended , it was impossible to completely chop off the array , but any strong emission in the off source positions was carefully blanked out in the data reduction stage and should not affect the morphology or photometry of the point - like sources in the field .",
    "it does , however , affect the integrated flux density of the extended cloud emission , which is irrelevant for our analysis , since we are only interested in the embedded compact sources in the cloud .",
    "the data used in this paper come from three 5-integration maps obtained during scuba commissioning on march 30 and april 5 , 1997 .",
    "these maps were obtained in excellent submillimeter conditions with cso @xmath20 0.045 - 0.05 .",
    "analysis of this data set was discussed by @xcite .",
    "we additionally searched the jcmt archive at the cadc and found one more 6-integration map obtained in good submillimeter conditions ( cso @xmath21 ) on april 11 , 2000 , which we added to our data set .",
    "pointing corrections were derived from observations of the blazar 1929 - 293 and flux calibration from observations of uranus .",
    "we estimate the calibration accuracy to be better than 10% at 850  and better than 20% and 450 .",
    "the measured half power beam width ( hpbw ) for the 1997 and 2000 observations are remarkably similar .",
    "in 1997 we used a 120  chop throw , but an experimental chop waveform , which broadened the beam in the chop direction , while the observation from april 2000 used a 150  chop throw , which also broadened the beam by about the same amount .",
    "the hpbw is therefore @xmath7 156 @xmath17 135 and 91 @xmath17 78 for 850  and 450 , respectively with the major axis aligned with the chop direction .",
    "the data were reduced in a standard way using surf @xcite and starlink imaging software , i.e. , we flat fielded , extinction corrected , sky subtracted , despiked , and calibrated the images in jy beam@xmath15 .",
    "we then pointing corrected each data set for any drift in pointing between each pointing observation and added the data together to determine the most likely submillimeter position at 850 .",
    "once we had derived a basic 850  astrometric image , we made gaussian fits of point - like sources for each data set and derived small additional ra and dec corrections to each scan ( shift and add ) to sharpen the final image to this position .",
    "manual gaussian fitting for these closely spaced , embedded sources is more reliable than automatic clump finding routines ( e.g. clumpfind ) , which often to not find clumps embedded in an extended cloud , especially if those clumps are close to each other .",
    "since there is a small mis - alignment between the 850 and 450  arrays , we first corrected the 450  images for any pointing drifts and then did shift and add using an isolated compact source in the 850  image as an astrometric reference source for the 450  data .",
    "we estimate the astrometric accuracy in our scuba images to be @xmath5 2 .",
    "the final coadd was done by noise - weighting the data in order to minimize the noise in the final images .",
    "the images were coadded by weighting with the inverse square of the noise in each set and accounting for the difference in integration time .",
    "the first image is taken as a reference and then the weighting factors are computed for each subsequent ]    this method minimizes the noise in the final coadded image .",
    "the rms of the 450  image is @xmath7 0.3 jy beam@xmath15 and @xmath7 12 mjy beam@xmath15 for the 850  image .",
    "all our maps were converted to fits - files and exported to miriad @xcite for further analysis . in order to correct for the error lobe contribution , especially at 450",
    ", we have deconvolved all the maps using clean and an elliptical model beam derived from our uranus observations .",
    "our model beam is composed of three symmetric gaussians : a main beam , a near - error lobe , and an extended , low amplitude , far - error lobe .",
    "we rotated this model beam to the approximate rotation angle of each individual map and took the average of the rotated beams to provide a more accurate model beam for our coadded maps .",
    "figure [ fig - sma ] shows the sma 1.1 mm continuum image .",
    "we detect two sources of approximately equal flux density .",
    "the positions and flux densities derived from two - dimensional gaussian fits to the sources are given in table [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "sma1 , the eastern source , is marginally resolved , with an estimated source size of 11 @xmath17 05 at p.a .",
    "= @xmath22 .",
    "the western source , sma2 , is unresolved .",
    "sma1 coincides to within 016 of a centimeter source designated by various names : vla10e ( irs7b ) by @xcite , source 8 @xcite , and source 14/irs7e @xcite .",
    "sma1 also coincides within 017 of the hard x - ray source cxou j190156.4 - 365728 @xcite .",
    "sma1 is detected in all irac bands and at 24  with mips ( see section [ spitzer ] and table [ tbl-3 ] ) .",
    "in contrast , sma2 is not seen in either the x - ray , near - ir or mid - ir bands , but its position is consistent with a centimeter source designated by various names : source 9 by @xcite , source 6 by @xcite , and source 11 by @xcite .",
    "the sma position of sma2 is within 05 of the s - band position reported by @xcite which agrees to 01 of the x - band contour map peak of @xcite .",
    "although those authors do not quote position uncertainties , @xcite notes that the vla position accuracy for their data on this low declination ( i.e. very low elevation ) source is @xmath23 . even if the vla position is accurate to @xmath24 , this uncertainty combined with the sma position uncertainty allow for the possibility that the 1.1  mm emission from sma2 is coincident with the centimeter source .",
    "sma2 also is within 093 of the 7  mm vla source ct2 @xcite ; the implications of this possible association are discussed later .",
    "sma1 and sma2 coincide with the two sub - mm sources smm1b and smm1c @xcite , which is seen more clearly in our scuba data ( section [ scuba ] ) .",
    "we do not detect irs7a ( vla10w , feigelson 7 , forbrich 12/irs7w ) , nor do we detect any sources in the `` prestellar '' core smm1a , which is the brightest extended source in the submillimeter continuum , located @xmath720  south of irs7 .",
    "our 850  and 450  scuba images ( figure [ fig - scuba ] ) agree qualitatively with the scuba results of @xcite , although we have better signal - to - noise and image quality due to a larger data set and improved data processing methods .",
    "we detect all the sub - mm sources seen by @xcite and additionally we identify a fainter core south of smm1a . although smm1a is not resolved at 850 , the 450  image suggests that it consists of two cores , rather than a single elongated elliptical core .",
    "this was also seen by @xcite in a high spatial resolution 800 -map and @xcite therefore listed smm1a as two separate sources .",
    "we have used the miriad task imfit to fit elliptical gaussians with a two - component gaussian fit ; one compact component for the core and an extended gaussian for the surrounding cloud .",
    "even though the surrounding cloud may not be well described by a single gaussian , this approach works reasonably well if one limits the region over which the fitting is done , so that the extended cloud emission can be approximated by a single gaussian . for very extended cores like smm1a and smm4 we approximated the surrounding cloud emission with a baseline plane rather than a gaussian .",
    "the uncertainty in the estimation of the background , however , adds about a 10 - 15% error to the integrated flux densities .",
    "the integrated flux densities and positions for the sub - millimeter continuum sources are given in table [ tbl-2 ] .",
    "these flux densities differ significantly from the flux densities quoted by @xcite , because their results include emission from the surrounding cloud .",
    "only two of the known near - ir sources ( irs1 and wbm55 ) in the r  cra cloud core coincide with compact submillimeter scuba sources , but in our high spatial resolution 450 @xmath3 m image we also resolve the two 1.1 mm sma continuum sources , sma1 , and sma2 as two separate compact dust emission peaks . irs5 and",
    "the new mid - ir source irac9 ( table 3 ) lie close to the peak of the extended submillimeter core smm4 , but we see no detectable dust emission excess from the stars themselves , even though our @xmath2co j = @xmath25 observations ( section [ co_outflow ] ) indicate that there may be a molecular outflow powered by one of these stars . neither do we detect dust emission from the two young haebe stars r cra and t cra .",
    "r cra is the most luminous source in the region @xcite .",
    "it is very strong in the mid - ir and illuminates a large reflection nebula .",
    "it is possible that the star may still be associated with a compact dust disk , but since it is situated near the cloud ridge encompassing sma1 and 2 ( figure [ fig - scuba ] ) , it is difficult to detect it , especially if the disk is small . from our 450 @xmath3 m image",
    "we estimate that the emission from such a disk would be less than 0.7 jy  beam@xmath15 . using the dust grain formalism of @xcite",
    ", this flux density limit corresponds to a mass limit of @xmath26  ( assuming @xmath27 and @xmath28 , i.e. the average disk sed parameters found in the survey of @xcite ) .",
    "irs1 , also known as hh100-ir , illuminates a prominent cigar - shaped reflection nebula @xcite with an hh object ( hh97 ) near the tip of the nebula , indicating that one sees the cavity walls of an outflow driven by irs1 .",
    "wbm55 is near the hh objects hh104 a & b , but these are probably excited by sma2 ( see section [ co_outflow ] ) or some other young star in the the vicinity of sma2 .",
    "nevertheless it is likely that wbm55 also drives an outflow .",
    "however , we do not see any dust emission from irs7 , which has been suggested as a possible candidate for driving the large scale co outflow @xcite .",
    "irs7 is deeply embedded ( @xmath29 ) in the cloud core and appears as a nebulous knot in @xmath30 band .",
    "@xcite suggested that the 2.2 @xmath3 m emission may originate from the nebulosity and that the star itself is invisible at @xmath30 band .",
    "this suggestion gets further support from the high contrast images presented by @xcite and @xcite which show a larger reflection nebulosity to the northeast seemingly forming a bipolar nebula . in this scenario",
    "one would expect the mid - ir ( i.e. irac emission ) and vla radio source to pinpoint the location of the star and place it northwest of the near - ir position .",
    "@xcite derive an accurate 2.2 @xmath3 m position , which is slightly north of the irac / vla position , suggesting that the 2.2 @xmath3 m emission has the same energy origin as the mid - ir emission . to illustrate the complexity of this region we display a sub - image of the 450 @xmath3 m image covering only sma1 , irs7 and sma2 in figure [ fig - irs7_450 ] .",
    "here we overlay the irac positions ( table 3 ) , the cm vla positions from @xcite , and the 7  mm vla positions from @xcite .",
    "this figure shows clearly that sma2 and irs7 are different objects .",
    "we retrieved spitzer gto observations for the r  cra region from the spitzer data archive @xcite .",
    "these gto observations included irac images at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0 , as well as mips observations at 24 .",
    "figure [ fig - irac ] shows a composite irac 4.5  image derived from the `` long '' and `` short '' exposure time images for increased dynamic range .",
    "the spatial resolution of irac permitted the use of simple aperture photometry using the starlink gaia package to extract positions and flux densities for all 8  sources within a 2  radius of irs7 ( table  [ tbl-3 ] ) .",
    "the photometric uncertainty is estimated at @xmath710% , dominated by the uncertainty of the background level in the artifact - filled field .",
    "the astrometric accuracy of the irac images ( @xmath5 03 ) confirms that the infrared object irs7 is associated with the vla source irs7a ( vla10w ) @xcite and the hard x - ray source x@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "for the first time we also detect an infrared counterpart to the radio source irs7b ( vla10e ) , which we have identified as sma1 in our 1.1 mm continuum imaging .",
    "we have also discovered a new , relatively faint mid - ir source , irac9 , @xmath7 9  northeast of irs5 .",
    "the pipeline reduced `` post - bcd '' mips images were used to obtain aperture and psf fitted photometry for any 24 @xmath3 m sources in the vicinity of sma1 and sma2 .",
    "sma1 was clearly detected at 24 but it was saturated and very near the sources irs7 and r  cra , which were also badly saturated .",
    "we estimated flux densities by fitting the unsaturated wings of the psfs to create a `` restored '' unsaturated psf for flux estimation .",
    "the process was iterative .",
    "we first fit r  cra ( 200@xmath3120 jy ) , and subtracted the model psf from the image , then fit irs7 ( 65@xmath3115 jy ) , and finally fit sma1 ( 20@xmath315 jy ) .",
    "the flux density obtained by this procedure agrees quite well with ground based photometry .",
    "@xcite quote 218 @xmath31 6 jy for r cra and 37 jy for irs7 at q ( 20 @xmath3 m ) . after the subtraction of the three model psfs",
    ", there was no indication that sma2 was detected .",
    "the fitting and subtraction of the highly saturated psfs likely masked any faint emission from sma2 .",
    "we use the flux density uncertainty estimate of sma1 to place an upper limit on the flux density of sma2 @xmath5 5 jy .",
    "we have constructed outflow maps from @xmath2co j = @xmath1 hht data which provide moderate ( 23 ) spatial resolution .",
    "figure [ fig - co ] shows the co outflow red and blue contours .",
    "the velocity intervals used to produce the red and blue contours are similar to @xcite , at -10 to + 3 km  s@xmath15 for the blue wing , and 10 to 21 km  s@xmath15 for the red wing .",
    "these data provide about three times the spatial resolution of @xcite , and confirm that the center of the outflow is in the vicinity of irs7 . even with this spatial resolution the co map gives the appearance that the high velocity emission is dominated by a single outflow centered near irs7 and sma2 . a closer inspection , however , shows features which are hard to explain with a single outflow .",
    "this is not surprising , since we know that there is a young cluster embedded in the molecular cloud core , several of which appear to be surrounded by active accretion disks .",
    "we plot the optically - detected emission line objects ( hh objects ) from @xcite and @xcite in figure [ fig - co ] . in figure [ fig - co ]",
    "we draw a line connecting the peaks of the red and blue outflow lobes .",
    "this line ( at p.a .",
    "@xmath32 ) passes almost exactly through sma2 , and also is very close to the hh104 objects .",
    "@xcite believe that hh104 c and d are associated with irs6 and a nearby optically detected jet , and not associated with hh104 a and b. the spatial association of hh104 c and d with the sma2 outflow axis could therefore be coincidental .",
    "sma2 is also located at the approximate ew center of the co outflow lobes .",
    "we believe this is sufficient evidence to attribute the major outflow activity in the region to sma2 .",
    "further evidence for this conclusion comes from the fact that in all 13 of the molecular lines measured by @xcite , the fwhm linewidths are broader when the apex telecope beam encompasses sma2 , compared to sma1 .",
    "we also find a second , smaller co outflow , centered on the infrared source hh100-ir @xcite , with the outflow axis parallel to the line connecting the hh objects hh98 ( slightly red - shifted ) and the two blue - shifted hh - objects hh100 and hh97 .",
    "this outflow could also be associated with hh99a and hh99b @xcite .",
    "a measured proper motion for hh99 reported by @xcite is at a similar position angle to the line connecting the outflow lobes shown in [ fig - co ] .",
    "the blue - shifted outflow lobe is less prominent than the optical / near - ir cavity , presumably because the blue outflow emerges out of the dense cloud core into the low density halo , and therefore encounters much less gas to interact with .",
    "other small outflows could exist , but do not have the reinforcing evidence of the presence of optically - detected emission line objects .",
    "sma1 , for example , could be driving an outflow oriented nnw , which could explain the blue - shifted ridge northwest of sma2 , although there is also faint blue - shifted emission to the south of sma1 .",
    "another possibility for the blue - shifted ridge nw of sma2 is a roughly e - w outflow from irs6 .",
    "alternatively , the red - shifted emission in the vicinity of irs6 could be part of a ne - oriented red - shifted outflow lobe originating from or near irs5 with the blue outflow lobe too faint to be detected in the low - density cloud sw of irs5 .",
    "one will need much higher spatial resolution and sensitivity to disentangle the outflows from the young stars in the r cra core .",
    "therefore , in the following analysis , we compute mass estimates from the integrated red - shifted and blue - shifted emission as if it originates from a single outflow .",
    "we assume that the excitation temperature is equal to the peak co line temperature at each map position ( i.e. the line cores are optically thick ) , and the line wings are optically thin . we compute the total mass and energetics for the entire outflow complex .",
    "following @xcite ,    @xmath33    we calculate a red lobe mass of 0.04 , and a blue lobe mass of 0.03 , assuming a co abundance relative to @xmath34 of @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "this is considerably less than the masses calculated for the outflow in @xcite , but these data cover only a quarter of the area on the sky .",
    "in addition , the assumption that the line wings are optically thin make these estimates lower limits for the mass .",
    "as shown for @xmath2co j = @xmath36 in @xcite , this assumption leads to an underestimation of the mass in the outflow by a factor of several , depending on the level of self absorption in the line . also , the filling factor of the warmer gas traced by @xmath2co j = @xmath1 could be less than in the case of @xmath2co j = @xmath37 . with these caveats ,",
    "the mass and associated momentum , kinetic energy and mechanical luminosity are consistent with the results found in @xcite .",
    "the interferometric hco@xmath0 j = @xmath1 observations reveal a very clumpy distribution of emitting gas with a complex velocity field .",
    "clearly , the lack of short spacing information severely limits the contents and fidelity of the image .",
    "lines are typically about 2 km s@xmath15 wide , and can exhibit complex line shapes .",
    "a simplified contour plot with `` red '' and `` blue '' contours is shown in figure [ fig - hco+int ] .",
    "this plot shows that the clumps of hco@xmath0 j = @xmath13 emission seem to follow a roughly spherical distribution around sma2 , and show no systematic spatial distribution of velocity .",
    "in addition , the hco@xmath0 j = @xmath1 clumps are not spatially coincident with either of the continuum sources sma1 or sma2 .",
    "the velocities of the clumps are also not consistent with the velocity distribution of the molecular ouflow seen in @xmath2co j = @xmath25 .",
    "the observed clumpy , chaotic velocity field also does not support the hypothesis of a circumstellar or circumbinary disk , as was suggested based on the kinematics of single - dish observations of hco@xmath0 j = @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "this clumpy structure might be the result of the interaction of many ouflows from the large number of protostars in the region .",
    "the velocity field of the clumps does not seem to correlate with the large scale outflows seen in co j = @xmath1 , but the complexity of the region is high , and the interferometric image obviously suffers from missing flux .",
    "another explanation for the observed morphology is that the clumps are knots in a spherical shell of material swept - up by the molecular outflows and winds produced by the young cluster .",
    "the critical density of the hco@xmath0 j = @xmath1 transition in which the clumps are observed suggests the density is of the order @xmath39 @xmath40 .",
    "in addition , the spatial filtering provided by the interferometer also favors the detection of clumpy structure .",
    "if this is the case , we can calculate an upper limit on the mass of the possible gaseous shell by assuming the gas is distributed in a uniform sphere , and that the column density is that of the brightest clump .",
    "assuming the lines are optically thin , we can calculate the column density in the same manner as the previous section .",
    "we can then estimate the mass by integrating over a circle of diameter 45 ( @xmath41  cm at a distance of 170 pc ) .",
    "we convert the flux density to brightness temperature using the following formula :    @xmath42    where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the fwhm dimensions of the source region ( in this case , the beam size ) .",
    "this results in a hco@xmath0 j = @xmath1 brightness temperature of 17.7 k , and an integrated intensity of 24.3 k  km  s@xmath15 . assuming an abundance of hco@xmath0 to h@xmath45 of @xmath46 @xcite , we calculate a shell mass of 2.1 @xmath17 10@xmath47 g , or 0.01 . with an expansion velocity of @xmath7 1.5 km  s@xmath15 ,",
    "the momentum and kinetic energy of the shell is small compared to that of the large scale molecular outflow .",
    "thus , the driving source(s ) of the outflow(s ) are easily capable of driving the expansion of such a shell , although the mechanism is unclear .",
    "alternatively , the shell could be driven by a wind from a more evolved pre - main - sequence star like irs7 .",
    "it is important to note that the ring like morphology we see in the interferometric hco@xmath0 map could be the result of a lack of zero spacing and short spacing data , rather than a reflection of the true gas morphology .",
    "future observations with combined interferometric and single dish data will be necessary to generate an unambiguous determination of the gas morphology around sma2 .",
    "the sma 1.1 mm data and scuba 850  and 450  data are combined with the mips and irac archival data to produce seds capable of constraining the peak of a greybody , thereby estimating the source temperature .",
    "the source seds and greybody fits are shown in figures [ fig - sma1 ] and [ fig - sma2 ] . neither source is detected in the near - infrared .",
    "the upper limits plotted are from @xcite who quote 3@xmath48 upper limits of ( 17.5 , 17.0 16.5 ) for the ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath30 ) bands .",
    "we fit sma1 with a two - temperature composite greybody .",
    "the uncertainties in the fitted and derived parameters have been estimated by perturbing the flux densities by @xmath51 ( in such a way as to maximize the change in fitted temperature ) and repeating the fit .",
    "we find temperatures of @xmath52 k and @xmath53 k for the two components , with a low frequency dust grain emissivity index @xmath54 . the warmer greybody was assumed to have @xmath55 .",
    "the integrated bolometric luminosity based on the sed for sma1 is @xmath6  .",
    "the total mass is @xmath56  , assuming a gas to dust mass ratio of 100 .",
    "the ratio of submillimeter luminosity to total luminosity in sma1 is @xmath57 , suggestive of a class 0/i source .",
    "the near infrared flux density upper limits are a factor of @xmath58 less than the sed peak ( @xmath59  jy at @xmath60 m ) , suggestive of a class  0 source @xcite .",
    "we also calculate the bolometric temperature of the source following @xcite .",
    "the bolometric temperature @xmath61 of a sed @xmath62 is defined as the temperature of a blackbody having the same mean frequency @xmath63 : @xmath64h\\bar{\\nu}/k=1.25~\\times~10^{-11}\\bar   { \\nu}~k~hz^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the riemann zeta function of argument @xmath66 , @xmath67 is planck s constant , @xmath68 is boltzmann s constant , and the mean frequency @xmath63 is the ratio of the first and zeroeth frequency moments of the spectrum : @xmath69 we numerically integrate the fitted sed to obtain a bolometric temperature of 83 k for sma1 .    for sma2 , only an upper limit exists for the 24  flux density , so we have determined the maximum and minimum temperature greybodies consistent with this mid - infrared upper limit and the 1.1  mm and submm detections .",
    "we find a maximum temperature of 63 k , and a long wavelength dust emissivity index of @xmath70 .",
    "the maximum luminosity is then @xmath53.3  , the mass is @xmath71 , and the bolometric temperature is @xmath570  k. the lower limit to the source temperature is 23  k , with a dust emissivity index of @xmath72 .",
    "this corresponds to a minimum luminosity of 0.15  , and a mass of @xmath73 .",
    "the ratio of submillimeter luminosity to total luminosity in sma2 is between @xmath74 ( cold limit ) and @xmath75 ( warm limit ) .",
    "the near - infrared flux density upper limits are between @xmath76 ( cold limit ) and @xmath77 ( warm limit ) times less than the sed peak",
    ". both of these ratios are consistent with typical characteristics of a class 0 source @xcite .",
    "considering the 7  mm data of @xcite , we note that our sed predicts 1.9  mjy from sma2 at that wavelength , whereas the measured value is @xmath78 mjy .",
    "we also note that the positions agree to within 09 , with most of the offset in declination . considering the low - elevation of the source when observed at the vla",
    ", the offset could be due to instrumental uncertainty .",
    "these facts leads us to favor the interpretation that much of the emission from ct2 is dust emission from sma2",
    ". a lesser portion of the 7  mm flux density ( @xmath79  mjy ) could be due to free - free emission from an ionized jet as it would still be consistent with a relatively flat centimeter - wave spectral index ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to ct2 , @xcite detected four more point sources in the irs7 field at 7  mm with the vla which we do not detect with the sma .",
    "ct4 has a negative spectral index , @xmath80 , i.e. the emission appears non - thermal , possibly gyrosynchroton emission , although @xcite did not detect any polarized emission .",
    "however , inspection of the data by @xcite and @xcite suggest that the centimeter vla emission is variable ; it could therefore still be free - free emission if the source was in a low state at the time of the 7  mm observations .",
    "due to their non - detection at cm wavelengths , ct1 , ct3 , and ct5 were hypothesized to have steep spectra ( @xmath81 ) . with no ir counterparts , @xcite",
    "suggest that the emission originates in compact dust disks around young low - mass stars .",
    "ct1 could be associated with a faint 450 @xmath3 m peak seen to the northeast of sma2 ( figure [ fig - irs7_450 ] ) , but we definitely see no 450 @xmath3 m excess from ct5 . furthermore , the sma should have detected these objects easily if they have temperatures typical of dust disks ( 20 - 30k ) . if the 7 mm emission from these objects is from dust , the only way their seds can be consistent with the sma non - detections and the vla 3.6 cm non - detections is if they are very cold ( @xmath82 ) and remain optically thick ( @xmath83 ) at wavelengths shortward of 1 cm . in this scenario",
    ", they could represent compact accretion cores just prior to the formation of a stellar embyro , such as the 10k `` class -1 '' objects predicted by @xcite .",
    "in any case , the reality and nature of these potentially interesting objects warrant further observations with atca or evla .      both @xcite and @xcite",
    "postulate that either one or both of the young stellar objects which we associate with sma1 and sma2 are class 0 protostars . @xcite and",
    "@xcite suggest that sma1 is a candidate class 0 source , but do not detect sma2 in their vla and chandra observations .",
    "our data suggest that sma2 is a class 0 source , while sma1 straddles class 0 and class i. it is clear that both sma1 and sma2 are submillimeter bright objects with centimeter radio counterparts , hard x - ray counterparts , and no detected near - ir counterparts .",
    "we see no evidence for binary association .",
    "neither object is detected at near - infrared wavelengths , but sma2 is detected in all four irac bands . at 24",
    "we detect sma1 and can only place an upper limit on the flux of sma2 , but the proximity to two extremely bright sources ( r  cra and irs7 ) have likely masked any 24  flux that may originate from sma2 . with a bolometric temperature upper limit of 70 k , no irac or near - ir detections , and the presence of a bipolar outflow , sma2 is very likely a class 0 source .",
    "sma1 has a bolometric temperature of 83 k and shows evidence for a higher temperature ( 350 k ) component in its sed .",
    "this suggests a more evolved evolutionary state , consistent with a class 0/class i transition object .",
    "its significantly higher luminosity ( 17@xmath84 ) also suggests that sma1 is a more massive protostar .",
    "when placed on a bolometric luminosity vs. temperature ( blt ) diagram @xcite , sma2 is consistent with the evolutionary track of a @xmath50.3  envelope when compared to the model tracks of @xcite .",
    "sma1 , with it s slightly higher bolometric temperature , but far higher bolometric luminosity , is consistent with a @xmath71 - 5  envelope mass .",
    "caution must be used with the use of a blt diagram to derive masses , since @xmath61 is not a good estimator of age , resulting in the rather wide range of acceptable masses for the two sources .",
    "@xcite believe that sma1 and sma2 form a protobinary system similar to iras 16293 @xcite .",
    "we do not find evidence that supports this conclusion .",
    "the two sources seem to be at different evolutionary states , with very different source properties .",
    "our outflow data shows evidence for one large scale outflow associated with sma2 , and at least one smaller outflow ( associated with hh100-ir ) .",
    "a small outflow with an axis roughly orthgonal to the sma2 outflow could be driven by sma1 .",
    "in addition , the `` shell '' of hco@xmath0 emission seems to be spatially centered on sma2 , with little association with sma1 .",
    "in the situation of a coeval protobinary , any shells of material would likely be surrounding the entire protobinary system , not a single member .",
    "we postulate that the hco@xmath0 emission could be the result of the interaction of many molecular outflows , or could trace a shell of material around sma2 , swept up by the outflow or by a lower velocity wind from a single object .",
    "would such a shell be gravitationally bound to the central object , or would it be expanding ? using the mass estimate from the previous section , we can compare the kinetic energy of the possible shell to its gravitational potential energy .",
    "here , we have maximized the mass estimate of the shell , and use the best estimates for the protostellar envelope mass and protostar mass derived from the blt diagram .",
    "we calculate that the kinetic energy is more than a factor of 20 higher than the gravitational potential energy .",
    "this suggests that the material is not gravitationally bound to the central object .",
    "further understanding of the kinematics and structure of the dense molecular gas in this region will require interferometric observations combined with zero spacing data from properly - sized single dish telescopes , a technique that is envisioned as a standard capability of the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) @xcite .",
    "similarly , mosaiced interferometric co observations with zero spacing , or data from new , large single dish telescopes such as the large millimeter telescope ( lmt ) should be able to more accurately trace the source(s ) of the bipolar outflows .",
    "we have observed the r  cra molecular cloud in the region surrounding the near - ir source irs7 with the submillimeter array in 1.1 mm continuum and the hco@xmath0 j = @xmath1 line .",
    "we present complementary scuba / jcmt 850  and 450  continuum images , spitzer archival irac and mips 24  images and desertstar / hht @xmath2co j = @xmath1 maps of the molecular outflow .",
    "we detect two compact continuum sources , sma1 and sma2 previously identified by @xcite as smm1b and smm1c , which are not associated with any known near - ir counterparts but are detected at centimeter and hard x - ray wavelengths .",
    "the brighter , spatially - extended source smm1a is not detected in our interferometric observations .",
    "the sed of sma1 derived from the sma , scuba and spitzer data is best fit by a two component greybody with temperatures of 55  k and 344  k , and a long wavelength dust grain emissivity index @xmath85 .",
    "the bolometric temperature of the source is 83 k , with a bolometric luminosity of @xmath6 .",
    "while sma2 is detected at 1.1 mm , 870  and 450 , we do not detect it at 24  or in any irac bands . from the flux density upper limit at 24 , we compute the maximum temperature greybody model consistent with the data to be 63 k with @xmath70 .",
    "the bolometric temperature is @xmath570 k , and the bolometric luminosity is between 0.15 and 3.3 .",
    "these results suggest that sma2 is a low mass ( @xmath86 ) class 0 source , while sma1 is a transitional class 0/class i object of higher envelope mass ( @xmath71 - 5 ) .",
    "we see evidence for a single large scale molecular outflow driven by sma2 , with evidence for at least one more smaller outflow associated with hh-100ir ( irs1 ) .",
    "the hco@xmath0 j = @xmath1 emission detected with the sma is very clumpy in nature , with a complex velocity field consistent with a spherical shell of material blown by a wind from one or more of the members of the young cluster .",
    "this emission could also be explained by the interaction of outflows driven by the many ysos in the region .",
    "future interferometric observations with zero spacing and short baseline data will assist in determining the distribution of gas around these two protostars .",
