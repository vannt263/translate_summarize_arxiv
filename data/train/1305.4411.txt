    "preparation of the degenerate gases is similar to that described in refs .",
    "@xcite . during the first 8 s of preparation ,",
    "@xmath143@xmath144 atoms are collected in a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) from an atomic beam .",
    "after the mot fields are turned off , @xmath145 atoms remain trapped in the standing - wave dipole trap , which spatially overlaps with the mot and whose depth is @xmath146 @xmath13k .",
    "immediately after the mot is off , a uniform magnetic field along the @xmath147 direction starts to rise reaching 840 g in 100 ms . at 500600",
    "ms after the mot is off , one of the beams , forming the standing wave , is gradually extinguished .",
    "the gas ends up in a cigar - shaped optical dipole trap .",
    "the remaining procedure depends on whether the final magnetic field @xmath27 , at which the gas is imaged , is above or below 840 g.    if the final @xmath148 g , the evaporative cooling is performed at 840 g. this allows to achieve the lowest temperatures and ensures thermal equilibrium at higher final fields , where collisions are less frequent . at 1",
    "s after the mot is off , forced evaporation commences : the trap depth lowers by a factor of 60 as @xmath149 . in the single - beam dipole trap at depth below 40 @xmath13k , the axial confinement is dominated by the small curvature of the magnetic field , which gives trapping frequency 12.6 hz at 840 g and compresses the cloud in the axial direction . at 14 s after the mot is off , the standing wave is reestablished . 1 s later , forced evaporation continues : trap lowers by a factor of 3055.8 exponentially for 11 s with the time constant 2.733.23 s. immediately after , the potential is increased by a factor of 979 following the @xmath150 law . at 26.426.7 s after the mot is off , the magnetic field is set to its final value @xmath27 . at 27.327.4",

    "the evaporation is done at the same field as the imaging is . at 1 s",

    "s after the mot is off , the standing wave is reestablished ; at 15.4 s , the magnetic field is switched from 840 g to the final value 730830 g ; and at 15.6 s , the second stage of forced evaporation begins : the potential exponentially decreases by a factor of 2.5 with the time constant 1.5 s ; then between 17 and 23.9 s the potential decreases by a factor of 13.520 with the time constant 1.761.96 s. afterwards , the potential is raised by a factor of 2.517 over 3 s exponentially with the time constant 0.110.31 s. we checked , using an ideal - fermi - gas model , that this rise does not excite collective modes . after the rise ,",
    "the potential is held still for 100 ms in the majority of the experiments , while in a few cases the hold time is 418 ms .",
    "finally , the lattice turns off , the gas expands for @xmath152@xmath154 @xmath13s , and the density distribution is measured .",
    "frequencies @xmath155 , @xmath156 , and @xmath157 are measured by observing parametric resonances at @xmath158 g , where the gas is noninteracting .",
    "the anharmonicity in the @xmath159 and @xmath50 directions is accounted for by comparing excitation spectrum to exact calculations of an ideal - gas dynamics , while @xmath157 is found by comparing resonant frequency to the splitting between the bloch bands .",
    "the most shallow traps are used in the bose regime where the chemical potential is small and , therefore , the anharmonic corrections are least important .",
    "the absorption imaging technique is employed : the gas is irradiated by a 3.7 @xmath13s pulse of a uniform laser beam resonant to a cycling two - level transition for one of the two spin states at the wavelength of @xmath160 nm .",
    "the intensity is 1.31.7 mw/@xmath161@xmath162 , where @xmath163 mw/@xmath164 is the saturation intensity . the shadow , which the atoms make in the imaging beam , is projected and recorded on a ccd camera . from the shadow , we reconstruct the column density distribution @xmath165  @xcite .",
    "an example of such distribution is shown in fig .",

    "one pixel corresponds to a @xmath170 @xmath13m@xmath166 area at the atom location .    in all measurements ,",
    "prior to imaging , the potential is turned off and the gas expands for the time @xmath171 ranging from @xmath172 to @xmath173 and typically @xmath174 . despite the expansion , the imaging is nearly _ in situ _ for the transverse direction , because @xmath175 . during @xmath171 ,",
    "the transverse density distribution expands in a nearly selfsimilar way . for @xmath176 ,",
    "various models predict a 0.20.4% transverse expansion , with the lowest and highest values obtained within the bec hydrodynamics  @xcite and ballistic model , respectively . in the data analysis",
    ", we account for the respective decrease of the central density . on the contrary ,",
    "the expansion along @xmath1 is significant : for @xmath176 , each cloud expands along @xmath1 by a factor of 68 as calculated within the ballistic and unitary hydrodynamic  @xcite model , respectively .",
    "the modulation along @xmath1 nearly disappears , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : coldensity ] .",
    "this removes a potential systematic : if the clouds were too thin in the @xmath1 direction , the image would not fit into our na=0.29 objective , reducing the apparent atom number  @xcite",
    ". the rms cloud half - width along @xmath1 may be as large as 4 @xmath13 m .",
    "such significant cloud overlap does not compromise measured @xmath42 distributions , because the 1530 central clouds , which are used for analysis , and the clouds adjacent to them have nearly identical transverse profiles . also the cloud overlap may be reducing the collective effects in light absorption , which are discussed below .    at the time of imaging , at the center of the joint cloud that appears from overlap of the initial isolated clouds , typical distance between same - spin atoms is @xmath177@xmath178@xmath179 .",
    "the optical density is in the range od=0.251.1 . despite @xmath180 ,",
    "we clearly observe collective effects in light absorption : as the gas keeps expanding for times @xmath181 , the apparent number of atoms @xmath182 keeps increasing saturating at interparticle distance in the densest part of the cloud @xmath183 and @xmath184 .",
    "it is not clear whether the collective absorption effect is local or depends on the cloud geometry .",
    "assuming locality , we set up correction of @xmath185 , the local density at each point of imaged gas , @xmath186 where @xmath187 is the apparent local density .",
    "as the alternative approach , we assume that collective absorption is nonlocal , and also that the long direction of the cloud is not a parameter of correction . in this case , the only parameter is the apparent optical density at the center , od .",
    "than the correction to the atom number takes form @xmath188 formula  ( [ eq : localcorrection ] ) assumes stronger corrections to the cloud center than to the edges , while ( [ eq : nonlocalcorrection ] ) corrects density distribution by a uniform factor .",
    "each formula reproduces correction to the atom number @xmath38 nearly equally well .",
    "therefore , there is no clear choice , whether local or nonlocal formula has to be applied .",
    "we apply each formula with 50% weight to correcting @xmath24 and @xmath82 .",
    "the half - difference between these two corrections is taken as a systematic error .",
    "typical correction to @xmath82 is @xmath189 .",
    "the following example may serve for estimating the difference of these two corrections : in the fermi region , when solely local correction  ( [ eq : localcorrection ] ) is applied , @xmath82 is 8.5% above the fermi - liquid model  @xcite , while for nonlocal correction  ( [ eq : nonlocalcorrection ] ) the normalized pressure is 12.3% above the model .    on the bose side of the feshbach resonance ( @xmath190 g ) , formation of the feshbach molecules does not reduce the visible number of atoms in comparison to that on the fermi side .",
    "this is consistent with ref .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath191 closed - channel fraction was found at @xmath192 g. the planar density @xmath55 , which is needed for calculating @xmath193 , may be obtained from @xmath42 by means of the inverse abel transform . prior to the transform , noise in @xmath42 with spatial period smaller than @xmath194 of the apparent thomas - fermi radius is filtered out .",
    "such filtering leaves the apparent temperatures nearly unchanged .",
    "since the original abel transform is for cylindrical objects while the clouds are elliptic ( @xmath33 ) , we stretch the @xmath50 coordinate @xmath195 .",
    "then the inverse abel transform is applied as @xmath196 where @xmath197 .",

    "[ fig : planardensitynofiltering ] is among the least noisy . in different experiments ,",
    "the rms noise on @xmath42 is typically @xmath200 of @xmath201 and nearly always within 1.54% .",
    "if high - frequency noise in @xmath42 were left unfiltered , the rms noise in @xmath47 would be 1030% of the central density @xmath24 , when calculated for @xmath202 within @xmath203 of the apparent thomas - fermi radius .",
    "modeling shows that such noise in @xmath47 would correspond to quite high 516% standard error in @xmath24 , when @xmath24 is determined from the parabolic fit .",
    "prefiltering of @xmath42 reduces the fit error significantly .",
    "for example , modeling predicts reduction of the fit error in @xmath24 down to 1.24.4% .",
