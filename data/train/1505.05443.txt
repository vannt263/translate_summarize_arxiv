    "duplex stainless steels ( dss ) have achieved great success in the development of stainless steels and have led to numerous commercial applications .",
    "they consist of approximately equal amounts of ferrite and austenite .",
    "though dss successfully combined the merits of these two phases , the brittle cleavage problem in the ferrite component has attracted further consideration  @xcite . in order to grasp the mechanism of ductility in dss , in the present work we concentrate on the effect of mn and ni additions on the intrinsic properties of ferromagnetic fe .",
    "both alloying elements are fundamental constituents of dss and they are primarily responsible for the stabilization of the austenite phase in the low - carbon alloys .",
    "the mechanical properties of engineering alloys are determined by a series of mechanisms controlling the dislocation glide ( such as elasticity , grain size , texture , grain boundary cohesion , solid solution and precipitation hardening ) .",
    "describing such phenomena using merely _ ab initio _ calculations is not feasible . on the other hand ,",
    "the mechanical properties are closely related to several material parameters which are within reach of such theoretical tools .",
    "in particular , the fracture work depends on the surface energy , elastic energy , and plastic energy  @xcite . following the relationship between the crack and the surface energy ( @xmath6 ) , and the plastic deformation and the unstable stacking fault ( usf ) energy ( @xmath7 ) , rice @xcite proposed that the brittle - ductile behavior can be effectively classified by the @xmath8 ratio . in body - centered cubic ( bcc ) system ,",
    "plastic deformation shows various kinds of complexity due to its intricate dislocation core structure , multiple slip systems and the cross slip between them .",
    "according to the peierls - narbarro model , the shear stress necessary for moving a dislocation in the lattice can be estimated as @xmath9 $ ] , where @xmath10 is the shear modulus , and @xmath11 the poisson ratio . here",
    "@xmath12 represents the characteristic interlayer distance , and @xmath13 is the burgers vector . for a fixed structure ,",
    "@xmath14 depends only on the slip system .",
    "accordingly , the greatest @xmath12 and the shortest @xmath13 give the lowest resistant stress , which corresponds to the most likely slip system .",
    "usually , such slip systems have the closest packed atomic plane and the closest packed slip direction . in the bcc lattice , this is the @xmath4 slip system , _",
    "i.e. _ , slip occurs along the @xmath15 direction on the @xmath3 planes .",
    "a recent molecular dynamics study @xcite showed that other plane families such as @xmath16 and @xmath17 can be also efficient in bcc fe .    unfortunately , both the usf energy and the surface energy for a particular crystallographic facet are extremely difficult to verify from experiments , and thus today the limited available data are exclusively based on first - principles quantum - mechanical calculations .",
    "however , long before the era of `` _ _ ab initio _ _ materials science '' , pugh summarized dozens of experimental data and developed a simple phenomenological model  @xcite which correlates the fracture properties with some easily accessible elastic parameters . according to this model",
    ", the ductility of materials can be characterized by the ratio between the bulk modulus @xmath18 and the shear modulus @xmath10 .",
    "ductile materials usually possess @xmath19 , whereas brittle materials have typically @xmath20 .",
    "the pugh ratio is often used in modern computational materials science to assess and predict trends at relatively low calculation cost .",
    "one can easily establish a qualitative connection between the pugh criterion and that of rice .",
    "the surface energy is known to correlate with the cohesive energy @xcite , which in turn is to a large degree proportional to the bulk modulus since larger cohesive energy requires larger curvature of the binding energy curve .",
    "the usf energy represents the energy barrier upon shifting one half of the crystal over the other half .",
    "the slope of the so defined @xmath21-surface is expected to be proportional to @xmath7 ( maximum of the curve ) and also to the peierls - narbarro stress . assuming a constant poisson ratio , for a fixed lattice the latter is given merely by the shear modulus .",
    "hence , at least on a qualitative level one may expect that @xmath8 and @xmath22 should follow similar trends , _",
    "e.g. _ , upon alloying .",
    "the above correlations will be carefully investigated in the present work in the case of fe - mn and fe - ni alloys .    for an isotropic polycrystalline material the two elastic moduli @xmath18 and @xmath10 determine the poisson ratio @xmath23 .",
    "consequently , the pugh criterion imposes the constraint @xmath24 for the poisson ratio of ductile materials .",
    "the polycrystalline bulk and shear moduli are derived from single - crystal elastic constants by hill averaging of the voigt and reuss bounds @xcite . in the case of cubic crystals , these two bounds are related to pugh s ratio by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the zener anisotropy ratio .",
    "hence , for both limiting cases , the pugh ratio increases linearly with @xmath27 . for isotropic crystals @xmath28 and thus the pugh criterion for ductility requires @xmath29 . for weakly anisotropic lattices ( @xmath30 , which is the case of the present alloys )",
    ", the above condition modifies to @xmath31 or @xmath32 corresponding to the reuss or voigt value , respectively . for this anisotropy level",
    ", the hill average requires @xmath33 for ductile materials . the above defined @xmath34 parameter",
    "is closely connected to the cauchy pressure @xmath35 .",
    "negative cauchy pressure ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath36 ) implies angular character in the bonding and thus characterizes covalent crystals while positive cauchy pressure ( @xmath37 ) is typical for metallic crystals @xcite .",
    "in other words , if the resistance of the crystal to shear ( @xmath38 ) is larger than the resistance to volume change ( @xmath39 ) , the system shows covalent features and vice versa .",
    "this condition based on the cauchy pressure is in line with the one formulated by pugh .",
    "compared to the criteria based on pugh ratio and cauchy pressure , the condition developed by rice is expected to give more physical insight into the mechanism of plastic deformation . however , the application of rice condition based on planar defect energies is related to the specific deformation mode and crystal orientation . in principle",
    ", one should analyze all possible cases with appropriate statistical weights . except simple cases , such as the face - centered cubic ( fcc ) lattice ,",
    "this makes the rice approach rather cumbersome . in turn , the pugh rule was established from a series of experimental data and is based on simple physical quantities .",
    "although many assumptions are involved in this empirical approach , it has been confirmed to be practical in a large number of former scientific studies .    in the present work ,",
    "we focus on the alloying effect of ni and mn on ferrite fe - based dilute alloys . in order to study the possible mechanisms behind the well - known facet cleavage problem in dss alloys , which to a large extent limits their engineering applications ,",
    "here we carry out systematic electronic structure calculations to find the single - crystal and polycrystalline elastic parameters and the surface and usf energies as a function of chemical composition .",
    "we consider the @xmath4 slip system due to its special role in the plastic deformation of the bcc lattice .",
    "accordingly , we compute the surface energy for the @xmath3 crystallographic facet and the usf energy for the @xmath3 plane along the @xmath15 slip direction .",
    "the theoretical predictions are used to assess various ductility parameters discussed above .",
    "the rest of the paper is divided into three main sections and conclusions .",
    "section  [ tools ] gives a brief description of the employed theoretical tools , an introduction to the theory of elasticity and planar defects , and lists the important numerical details .",
    "the results are presented and discussed in sections  [ result ] and [ discussion ] , respectively .",
    "the total energy calculations were performed using the exact muffin - tin orbitals ( emto ) method  @xcite . this density functional theory",
    "( dft ) solver is similar to the screened korringa - kohn - rostoker method , where the exact kohn - sham potential is represented by large overlapping potential spheres . inside these spheres",
    "the potential is spherically symmetric and constant between the spheres .",
    "it was shown  @xcite that using overlapping spheres gives a better representation of the full - potential as compared to the traditional muffin - tin or atomic - sphere approximations . within the emto method",
    ", the compositional disorder is treated using the coherent - potential approximation ( cpa )  @xcite and the total energy is computed via the full - charge density technique  @xcite .",
    "the emto - cpa method has been involved in many successful applications focusing on the thermo - physical properties of alloys and compounds  @xcite , surface energies  @xcite and stacking - fault energies  @xcite . here",
    "we would like to make a brief comment on cpa . due to the single - site nature",
    ", cpa can not account for the effect of local concentration fluctuations , short - range order effect and local lattice relaxation .",
    "this means that modeling the alloy by cpa one implicitly assumes a completely homogeneous random solid solution with a rigid underlying crystal lattice . on the other hand",
    ", cpa can be used to describe fluctuations within the supercell , e.g. near the unstable stacking fault or surface , by using variable concentrations for each atomic layer .",
    "this feature is used here as well when studying the segregation effects ( see section ii.c ) . in the case of fe - ni and fe - mn alloys , embedding a single impurity atom into the mean - field ( cpa ) green function means that we omit the inter - dependence between magnetic state and the local environment , which in turn could lead to specific local relaxation effects . in particular , within the present approximation the magnetic state of mn is determined by the coherent green function ( representing the average effect of all alloying elements ) rather than by the actual nearest neighbor atoms .",
    "nevertheless , such local effects are expected to be relatively small when the impurity level is below @xmath40% ( i.e. all impurities are mostly surrounded by fe ) .",
    "the self - consistent emto calculations were performed within the generalized - gradient approximation proposed by perdew , burke , and ernzerhof ( pbe )  @xcite .",
    "the performance of this approximation was verified for the fe - based systems in many former investigations  @xcite .",
    "the one - electron equations were solved within the soft - core scheme and using the scalar - relativistic approximation .",
    "the green s function was calculated for 16 complex energy points distributed exponentially on a semicircular contour including states within 1 ry below the fermi level . in the basis",
    "set , we included _",
    "s , p , d _ , and _",
    "f _ orbitals and for the one - center expansion of the full - charge density an orbital cut - off @xmath41 was used .",
    "the total energy was evaluated by the shape function technique with cut - off @xmath42  @xcite .",
    "for the undistorted bcc structure , we found that a homogeneous @xmath43-mesh of @xmath44 ensured the required accuracy .",
    "for the elastic constant calculations , we used about @xmath45 uniformly distributed @xmath43 points in the brillouin zones of the orthorhombic and monoclinic structures .",
    "the potential sphere radii for the alloy components were fixed to the average wigner - seitz radius . for the surface energy and usf energy calculations ,",
    "the @xmath43-mesh was set to @xmath46 in the the brillouin zone of the base - centered orthorhombic super - cell .",
    "the impurity problem was solved within the single - site cpa approximation , and hence the coulomb system of a particular alloy component @xmath47 may contain a non - zero net charge . here",
    "the effect of charge misfit was taken into account using the screened impurity model ( sim ) @xcite . according to that ,",
    "the additional shift in the one - electron potential and the corresponding correction to the total energy are controlled by the dimensionless screening parameters @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "the parameters @xmath48 are usually determined from the average net charges and electrostatic potentials of the alloy components obtained in regular supercell calculations @xcite .",
    "the second dimensionless parameter @xmath50 is determined from the condition that the total energy calculated within the cpa should match the total energy of the alloy obtained using the supercell technique . for most of the alloys , the suggested optimal values of @xmath51 and @xmath50",
    "are @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively @xcite .",
    "often @xmath48 for different alloy components are assumed to the same and @xmath54 is used .    in the present work ,",
    "considering the volume sensitivity of @xmath48 , a dynamic sim @xcite was applied for the fe - ni system . according to that ,",
    "the optimal @xmath48 varies as @xmath55 for @xmath56 lattice parameters @xmath12 ranging from @xmath57 to @xmath58    ( with interval of @xmath59  ) .",
    "the second sim parameter @xmath50 was fixed to 1 .",
    "for fe - mn , the sim parameters show rather weak volume dependence , so @xmath51 and @xmath60 were chosen to be @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively .",
    "the above figures for the sim parameters were obtained for a specific concentration ( 6.25 % ni or mn in fe ) and thus they are strictly valid only for that particular disordered system . however , in this study we assumed the same values for all binaries , _",
    "i.e. _ , the concentration dependence of the sim parameters was omitted .",
    "the elastic properties of a single - crystal are described by the elements of the elasticity tensor . in a cubic lattice ,",
    "there are three independent elastic constants : @xmath63 , @xmath39 and @xmath38 .",
    "the tetragonal shear elastic constant ( @xmath64 ) and the bulk modulus ( @xmath18 ) are connected to the single - crystal elastic constants through @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the adiabatic elastic constants are defined as the second order derivatives of the energy ( @xmath67 ) with respect to strain .",
    "accordingly , the most straightforward way to obtain the elastic parameters is to strain the lattice and evaluate the total energy change as a function of lattice distortion . in practice ,",
    "the bulk modulus is derived from the equation of state , obtained by fitting the total energy data calculated for a series of volumes ( @xmath68 ) or cubic lattice constants ( @xmath12 ) by a morse - type function  @xcite .",
    "since we are interested in equilibrium ( zero pressure ) elastic parameters , the fitting should involve lattice points nearby the equilibrium .",
    "it is known that bcc fe undergoes a weak magnetic transition at slightly enlarged lattice parameters ( @xmath69 ) , which should be excluded from the fitting interval to avoid undesirable scatter of the computed bulk modulus  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the present morse - type fit was limited to lattice parameters smaller than @xmath70 .",
    "the same interval was applied to all considered binary alloys to minimize the numerical noise due to the volume mesh .    since the total energy depends on volume much more strongly than on small lattice strains ,",
    "volume - conserving distortion are usually more appropriate to calculate @xmath64 and @xmath38 . here , we employed the following orthorhombic ( @xmath71 ) and monoclinic ( @xmath72 ) deformations @xmath73 where @xmath74 denotes the distortion parameter . for both lattice deformations ,",
    "six different distortions @xmath75 were used .",
    "these deformations lead to total energy changes @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively , where @xmath78 stands for the neglected terms .",
    "the polycrystalline shear modulus was obtained from the single - crystalline elastic constants according to the hill average  @xcite , @xmath79 , of the voigt , @xmath80 , and reuss , @xmath81 $ ] , bounds .",
    "the schematics of the usf and surface model are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . for usf ( panel",
    "a ) , we show a top view along the @xmath82 $ ] direction of the two atomic layers next to the stacking fault . the slip direction for the second ( filled open circles ) atomic layer is also shown .",
    "for the surface model ( panel b ) , we show the side view along the @xmath83 $ ] direction of the two surface atomic layers ( filled circles ) and the two empty layers ( empty circles ) mimicking the vacuum .",
    "the surface energy ( @xmath6 ) of chemically homogeneous alloys ( without segregation ) was extracted from total energy calculations for slabs following the method proposed by fiorentini and methfessel  @xcite .",
    "no reference to separately computed bulk total energies is made in this approach .",
    "instead , the reference bulk energy per layer is deduced from a linear fit to the slab total energy versus the slab thickness .",
    "slabs with 8 , 10 , and 12 atomic layers separated by 6 vacuum layers were used . according to punkkinen _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite the surface relaxation effects are small for the @xmath3 surface facet of fe and have an insignificant effect on the magnitude of the surface energy .",
    "our calculations confirmed this finding , and therefore here we omitted the effect of relaxation in all surface energy calculations .",
    "the usf energy ( @xmath7 ) was obtained in the following way .",
    "first , the total energies of 16 , 20 , and 24 layers thick supercells ( each containing two usf ) were calculated , and the bulk energy per layer was extracted from a linear fit to the energy versus thickness . because the usf seriously disturbs the atomic arrangement in the vicinity of the stacking fault plane , structural relaxations perpendicular to the fault plane have to be taken into account .",
    "we considered the relaxation effect for pure bcc fe and found that the first inter - layer spacing at the usf increases by approximately @xmath84 .",
    "for the fe - based alloys , we kept the mn / ni content below @xmath85 , which is expected to have a small additional effect on the layer relaxation .",
    "therefore , we used the structural relaxation obtained for pure fe for all binaries considered here .",
    "we also considered the effect of segregation on the surface energy and the usf energy . to this end , we varied the composition of the atomic layers next to the stacking fault or at the surface . unfortunately , the above described method to compute the formation energies based entirely on the slabs / supercells with different sizes is not applicable when the chemical concentration profile is no longer homogeneous .",
    "instead , all segregation studies were performed for a slab / supercell with fixed size and the impact of segregation was interpreted with respect to the homogeneous slab / supercell with the same size . in that way , possible numerical errors associated with the reference system were kept at minimal level . in particular , the effect of segregation on the usf energy was derived by subtracting the energy of the supercell without usf from the energy of the supercell with usf , both with segregation on the slip planes .",
    "the surface energy for the chemically inhomogeneous systems was computed following the method proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite based on the grand canonical ensemble and involving the effective chemical potentials .",
    "we assess the accuracy of the emto method for the present systems by comparing the results obtained for pure fe with those derived from previous full - potential calculations and the available experimental data .",
    "results are listed in table  [ tabi ] .",
    "the present lattice parameter @xmath12 is consistent with those from refs .",
    "all theoretically predicted equilibrium lattice parameter are , however , slightly smaller than the experimental value , @xmath86  @xcite , which is due to the weak pbe over binding . theory reproduces the experimental magnetic moment accurately .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in table  [ tabi ] , the present single - crystal elastic constants and the bulk modulus of bcc fe are compared with data from literature .",
    "the emto results are consistent with the other theoretical elastic constants , the deviations being typical to the errors associated with such calculations .",
    "however , compared to the experimental data , emto is found to overestimate @xmath63 by about @xmath87 , and underestimates @xmath38 by @xmath88 .",
    "the larger @xmath63 ( and the larger bulk modulus ) can be partly accounted for by the underestimated lattice parameter  @xcite .",
    "we notice that the excellent agreement in ref .",
    "@xcite between the theoretical and experimental bulk moduli is somewhat suspicious since the quoted single - crystal elastic constants results in @xmath89 gpa for the bulk modulus ( compared to @xmath90 gpa reported in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which is close to the present finding and also to that from ref .  @xcite .",
    "the pseudopotential  @xcite equilibrium lattice parameter is the largest among the theoretical predictions listed in the table , which might explain why the pseudopotential bulk modulus is surprisingly close to the experimental value .",
    "the emto surface energy is in close agreement with the full - potential result  @xcite and also with the semi - empirical value valid for an `` average '' surface facet  @xcite . the present usf energy ( @xmath91j / m@xmath92 ) reproduces the full - potential result from ref .",
    "@xcite within @xmath93 , which is well acceptable taking account that the present method is based on muffin - tin and full - charge density approximations .",
    "we recall that today it is not yet possible to measure the usf energy .",
    "according to the equilibrium phase diagrams , in ferromagnetic bcc fe the maximum solubility of mn is @xmath94 and that of ni is @xmath95 .",
    "nevertheless , in duplex stainless steels , solid solutions with substantially larger amount of mn and ni may appear as a result of the delicate balance between volume and surface effects . hence ,",
    "in the present theoretical study we go well beyond the experimental solubility limits and discuss the trends up to @xmath96 solute atoms in the fe matrix .",
    "the calculated equilibrium lattice parameters for bcc binary fe@xmath0mn@xmath1 and fe@xmath0ni@xmath1 alloys are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for @xmath2 .",
    "we find that for both binaries the lattice parameters show a weak dependence on the amount of alloying addition @xmath97 .",
    "our results , especially the alloying trends , are in reasonable agreement with the available experimental data  @xcite .",
    "mn@xmath1 and fe@xmath0ni@xmath1 alloys as a function of composition . for comparison , the measured values by sutton  @xcite and owen  @xcite are also included . ]    the lattice parameter of bcc fe increases with mn addition as @xmath97 increases from @xmath98 to @xmath99 .",
    "when fe is alloyed with more than 5% mn , the lattice parameter shows a small negative slope as a function of @xmath97 . due to the limited solubility of mn in bcc fe",
    ", the experimental data is restricted below @xmath100 mn . in contrast to mn , the lattice parameter of fe@xmath0ni@xmath1 monotonically increases with the ni amount .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite reported that the lattice parameter of fe@xmath0ni@xmath1 is a linear function of @xmath97 up to @xmath101 ni with small slope and remains constant at larger concentrations .",
    "this trend is reproduced by the present theory , although the switch from a weak positive slope to a constant value seems to be shifted to larger concentrations ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the present theory slightly overestimates the observed volume expansion due to alloying .",
    "this can have both theoretical and experimental origin .",
    "from the side of theory , the exchange - correlation functional ( pbe ) may produce a noticeable effect since it performs differently for the present metals .",
    "for instance , while pbe underestimates the equilibrium lattice parameter of bcc fe by @xmath102 , it slightly overestimates that of fcc ni ( @xmath103 ) @xcite .",
    "this error results in @xmath104  `` extra '' increase of the lattice parameter at @xmath85 ni compared to the ideal case when the dft error stays at the same level for different elements . a careful inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows that the above error accounts for about 30% of the deviation obtained between the theoretical and experimental slopes of @xmath105 for the fe - ni system .",
    "another possible source of error is the neglect of all thermal effects in the present theory . from the experimental point of view , not all measured data points are relevant for the present comparison .",
    "that is because both ni and mn are fcc stabilizer , and thus a perfect bcc single - phase is hard to attain . moreover , in the process of preparing the samples , different quenching temperatures and various annealing methods lead to subtle changes in the measured lattice parameter .    the overall small influence of mn / ni alloying addition on the lattice parameter of fe can be explained from the atomic volume and the magnetic moment .",
    "the atomic volumes of mn and ni are very close to that of fe . hence , based on the linear rule of mixing , small amounts of mn and",
    "ni should not affect the volume of fe to a large extent .",
    "on the other hand , the observed small increment can be ascribed to the complex magnetic interaction between the solute atoms and ferromagnetic fe matrix .",
    "the local magnetic moments in fe - mn and fe - ni are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] as a function of composition and lattice parameter .",
    "these results were extracted from the cpa calculations and the local magnetic moments represent the magnetic moment density integrated within the corresponding wigner - seitz cells . around the equilibrium lattice parameters ( @xmath106  ) ,",
    "the mn moments are antiparallel to those of fe .",
    "the magnitude of mn local magnetic moment @xmath34(mn ) decreases from @xmath107 to about zero as the amount of mn increases from zero to @xmath96 ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , upper right panel ) .",
    "this trend is consistent with the previous findings , namely that above @xmath108 mn , the coupling between fe and mn becomes ferromagnetic @xcite . at the same time , the magnetic moment of fe @xmath34(fe )",
    "is increased slightly with mn addition up to @xmath109 mn , above which a very weak decrease of @xmath34(fe ) can be observed ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , upper left panel ) . the enhanced @xmath34(fe )",
    "expands the volume as a result of the positive excess magnetic pressure @xcite . for @xmath110 , the small negative slope of @xmath34(fe )",
    "leads to vanishing excess magnetic pressure and thus to shrinking volume , in line with fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . on the other hand , the ni moments @xmath34(ni )",
    "always couple parallel with the fe moments ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , lower right panel ) and ni addition increases @xmath34(fe ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , lower left panel ) .",
    "this in turn increases the excess magnetic pressure and yields monotonously expanding volume with @xmath97 .",

    "@xcite .",
    "( in units of @xmath111 ) as a function of chemical composition and lattice parameter @xmath12 ( in units of  ) for fe and mn in fe@xmath0mn@xmath1 ( upper panels ) and fe and ni in fe@xmath0ni@xmath1 ( lower panels ) . ]    in order to gain more insight into the magnetic coupling between mn and the bcc fe host , we constructed a @xmath112 supercell in terms of the conventional bcc unit cell ( 16-atom supercell ) containing one or two mn impurity atoms , which correspond to @xmath113 mn and @xmath114 mn , respectively . in the case",
    "of one isolated impurity atom , mn couples antiferromagnetically to fe and the average magnetic moments of fe and mn are almost identical to those from the corresponding cpa calculation . in the case of @xmath114 mn in the supercell , both mn moments align parallel with respect to the surrounding fe host irrespective of their relative positions in the supercell",
    ". however , the magnitude of their moments scales with the distance between them .",
    "if the two mn atoms are located at nearest neighbor sites , their local magnetic moments are strongly reduced which may be interpreted as a result of competing magnetic interactions between mn - mn and mn - fe . at the same time , the local magnetic moments of the nearest fe atoms remain almost at the level of pure bcc fe , similar to the cpa result . these tests , based on supercell calculations ,",
    "confirm that cpa accurately mimics the behavior of the magnetic moments versus concentration in the dilute limit .",

    "namely , @xmath63 decreases with @xmath97 below @xmath115 alloying addition , and then increases at larger concentrations .",
    "but mn and ni give different effects on @xmath39 .",

    "the peculiar concentration dependencies obeyed by @xmath63 and @xmath39 originate mainly from the non - linear trend of the corresponding bulk modulus shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] .",
    "the two cubic shear elastic constants also exhibit complex trends .",
    "@xmath64 decreases with ni addition , which means that ni decreases the mechanical stability of the bcc lattice . at the same time",

    "@xmath38 increases with mn addition , but remains nearly constant upon alloying fe with ni .",
    "the present trends for the elastic constants are very close to those reported by zhang _",
    "_ @xcite using the same total energy method .",
    "the small differences seen at larger concentrations , especially in the case of the bulk modulus , are due to the different numerical parameters used in these two works .",

    "fe - ni , the lattice parameter increases nearly linearly with alloying whereas in fe - mn , the lattice parameter increases up to @xmath183 mn and then decreases with further mn addition .    for both fe - mn and fe - ni alloys ,",
    "the elastic moduli show a nonlinear trends as a function of concentration .",
    "the surface energy and the unstable stacking fault energy decrease by adding mn or ni to fe . for both planar fault energies , ni shows a stronger effect than mn .",
    "segregation seems to have a minor effect on the surface and usf energies for dilute fe - ni and fe - mn alloys . according to semi - empirical correlations based on the poisson ratio , the cauchy pressure , and the pugh ratio , we have found that mn makes the bcc fe - based dilute alloy more brittle and ni makes it more ductile .",
    "however , the study of @xmath8 for the @xmath3 surface and the @xmath4 slip systems indicates that both binary alloys become more ductile with increasing solute concentration although the relative fracture behavior is consistent with the other three criteria .",
    "this discrepancy between the rice and the pugh criteria is ascribed to the complex magnetic effects around the planar fault , which are however missing from the bulk parameters entering the pugh / cauchy criterion .    using the theoretical cleavage stress and the shear modulus associated with the dominant slip system in bcc alloys ,",
    "we introduce an alternative measure for the ductile - brittle behavior .",
    "we find that our @xmath184 ratio is able to capture the observed alloying effects in the mechanical properties of fe - rich fe - ni and fe - mn alloys .",
    "the superior performance of @xmath182 compared to the rice parameter lies in the additional information built in the theoretical cleavage stress as compared the surface energy .",
