    "with the discovery of binary black hole ( bh ) mergers by the laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory ( ligo ) , the era of gravitational wave ( gw ) astronomy and multimessenger astronomy including gws has begun @xcite .",
    "as the advanced ligo and virgo detectors approach design sensitivity in the next few years @xcite , exciting discoveries are expected to be made , including binary neutron star ( bns ) and ns ",
    "bh mergers @xcite .",
    "due to the absence of baryonic matter in these systems , stellar - mass binary bh mergers are not expected to produce bright electromagnetic ( em ) counterparts to their gw signal ( but see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "instead , mergers involving nss are expected to link the em and gw skies .",
    "furthermore , these mergers are also of wide interest as they offer a unique opportunity to constrain the equation of state ( eos ) of matter at supranuclear densities ( e.g. , @xcite ) and provide a prime candidate astrophysical site for the production of heavy elements in the universe , via r - process nucleosynthesis in the matter ejected during and possibly after merger ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "mergers involving nss are expected to generate em emission across the entire em spectrum and over a variety of timescales @xcite .",
    "detection of em counterparts will enable the identification of the host galaxy and its position within / relative to the host , which will provide valuable information on binary formation channels , age of the stellar population , and supernova birth kicks @xcite . additionally , by measuring redshifts , em counterparts can determine the distance to the source and help alleviate degeneracies in the gw parameter estimation between distance and inclination of the binary .",
    "moreover , combined gw and em observations can prove the connection between short gamma - ray bursts ( sgrbs ) and bns or ns - bh mergers ( see below ) , revealing crucial information on when and how a sgrb can be produced . finally , even without a gw detection , em counterparts can reveal exclusive information on the very rich physics of the merger and post - merger evolution , especially if the merger remnant is a massive ns @xcite .",
    "sgrbs are among the earliest proposed counterparts to bns and ns - bh mergers @xcite .",
    "the standard paradigm explains the formation of a sgrb via a relativistic outflow ( jet ) generated by a torus of matter accreting onto a remnant bh .",
    "although there is tentative evidence for this scenario on the basis of previous general - relativisitc magnetohydrodynamic ( grmhd ) simulations @xcite , much still remains to be understood .",
    "moreover , if the merger leads to the formation of a long - lived ns instead of a bh , which , as we argue below , can occur in an order unity fraction of all bns merger events ( but not in ns - bh mergers ) , baryon pollution in the surrounding of the merger site @xcite can choke a relativistic outflow @xcite or even prevent its formation in the first place . ref .",
    "@xcite has proposed the `` time - reversal '' scenario , in which the problem of baryon pollution can be avoided , with additional important observational consequences ( see @xcite for an alternative proposal ) . in order to explore the sgrb - merger connection for the bns case ,",
    "more simulations of systems with different properties are required , to examine in detail the merger and early post - merger dynamics and to better quantify the amount of baryon pollution and thus the potential for generating relativistic outflows .",
    "furthermore , magnetic fields are likely to play a key role in the formation of a jet and therefore investigating the nature of sgrbs demands grmhd simulations .",
    "kilonovae or macronovae represent another important em counterpart to the gw signal of bns and ns - bh mergers @xcite .",
    "these thermal transients at optical and infrared wavelengths and timescales of days to weeks are powered by heating from radioactive decay of r - process elements produced in the expanding sub - relativistic ejecta .",
    "the amount of r - process material synthesized in the dynamical ejecta ( e.g. , @xcite ) and in winds from the remnant object @xcite , or from a remnant accretion disk / torus @xcite depend sensitively on properties of the matter outflows at launch , such as the distributions in mass , velocity , entropy , and electron fraction .",
    "numerical simulations are necessary to investigate these properties in detail .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : kilonova ]    _ electromagnetic counterparts from dynamical ejecta_. as pointed out in the introduction , the ejecta of bns mergers represent very promising sites for r - process nucleosynthesis and might provide an important contribution to the heavy element abundances observed in the local universe ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the radioactive decay of these elements is expected to power a late - time em transient , a so - called kilonova or macronova , which is among the most promising em counterparts to the gw signal from bns mergers @xcite .",
    "although a proper analysis is beyond the scope of this work , we can use a simple analytical model by grossman et al .",
    "@xcite to provide a rough , order - of - magnitude estimate of the peak time , peak bolometric luminosity and effective temperature of kilonova / macronova transients corresponding to the bns mergers under investigation ( we refer to @xcite for a discussion on the limitations of the model ) : @xmath0 the above formulas are obtained from @xcite by fixing the ejecta opacity to the fiducial value @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "moreover , we set @xmath2 as in @xcite .",
    "note that here we are only considering the contribution from the dynamical ejecta that are formally unbound in our simulations .",
    "further mass outflows ( including magnetically / neutrino driven winds ) can also contribute to the kilonova / macronova emission , although with a higher effective temperature and shorter timescale due to the lower opacity @xcite .",
    "results are given in table  [ tab : kilonova ] .",
    "we find the ms1 and h4 models , both with equal and unequal mass , to have similar estimates for the kilonova / macronova parameters : peak time of @xmath3  day , peak luminosity of @xmath4  @xmath5 , and effective temperature around 3000  @xmath6 .",
    "the apr4 models eject instead around one order of magnitude more mass ( see table  [ tab : outcome ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : ejecta_rt ] ) , which results in much longer timescales , higher luminosity , and slightly lower effective temperature . in this case ,",
    "equal- and unequal - mass models also show appreciable differences , in particular in the peak time ( 16 days and 4 days for the equal- and unequal - mass models , respectively ) .    as a final note",
    ", we recall that the interaction of the ejecta with the interstellar medium can also produce an em transient via non - thermal synchrotron emission , which typically falls in the radio band and emerges on much longer timescales , up to @xmath7years @xcite .",
    "in this section , we conclude our analysis by discussing the gw emission of our bns mergers . for all our simulations , we extract the gw strain from the weyl scalar @xmath8 at a fixed radius of @xmath9 , without extrapolating to infinity .",
    "the numerical accuracy is discussed in the appendix .",
    "the gw strains given in the following are the coefficients of the decomposition into spin - weighted spherical harmonics @xmath10 , and the strain at a particular viewing angle can be obtained by multiplication with @xmath11 . for the time integration",
    ", we developed a new method which is described in @xcite ; the advantage is that the improved removal of offsets results in centered waveforms also for low - amplitude parts , i.e. minima and tails .",
    "( top panel ) and jump - corrected phase velocity ( bottom panel ) , between the magnetized apr4 equal - mass model and the corresponding non - magnetized model . ]",
    "more importantly , we also employ a scheme to detect phase jumps caused by over - modulation .",
    "this term denotes signals in the form @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is slowly changing compared to @xmath14 , but can have zero crossings .",
    "a sign change of @xmath15 then corresponds to a phase jump by @xmath16 of the signal .",
    "more generally , if @xmath15 is complex valued a rapid phase change occurs when @xmath15 passes close to the origin in the complex plane .",
    "our scheme decomposes the complex - valued strain amplitude @xmath17 as @xmath18 , such that @xmath19 has a significant imaginary part only near phase jumps , and a real part that can cross zero .",
    "this is expressed by a phase correction @xmath20 , with @xmath21 .",
    "for further details of the method , we refer to @xcite .",
    "the gw strain and the phase velocity for all magnetized models are shown in figures  [ fig : gw_strain_q10 ] and  [ fig : gw_strain_q09 ] .",
    "in addition , we visualize the phase jumps using the real part of @xmath19 and the jump - corrected phase velocity .",
    "all models show the characteristic amplitude minimum seen at merger in many bns simulations . using our heuristic phase jump detection , we find that those minima are caused by over - modulation .",
    "this is clearly visible in the phase velocities , which exhibit a sharp peak ( coincident with the time of the amplitude minimum ) before subtracting the correction @xmath20 .",
    "this observation is relevant for gw astronomy , where the data analysis is very sensitive to the phasing .",
    "for all the cases at hand , the phase around merger can be well described by two relatively smooth parts separated by a rapid jump by @xmath16 .",
    "the phase velocity at merger , i.e.  at the time of maximum strain amplitude , is given in table  [ tab : outcome ] .",
    "the jump - corrected phase velocity can still show a modulation lasting a few ms after merger ( most evident in the apr4 equal - mass case ) .",
    "this is most likely caused by quasi - radial oscillations , which we also observe in the maximum density .",
    "after merger , the instantaneous gw frequency increases slightly and slowly for the apr4 models , and remains almost constant for the ms1 models . for the h4 models , it increases significantly until the system starts collapsing into a bh . for the equal - mass model , the frequency quickly increases to @xmath22 at the time of the collapse . for the unequal - mass h4 model ,",
    "the simulation was ended before the signal of the collapse reached the extraction radius .",
    "for the cases at hand , we find that the frequency drift becomes larger the closer the remnant is to the collapse threshold .    in terms of post - merger waveforms ,",
    "long - lived remnants ( apr4 , ms1 eos ) are characterized by comparable amplitudes that decay significantly within @xmath23@xmath24 .",
    "the hmns cases ( h4 eos ) have instead a stronger and more persistent emission until the sudden drop of amplitude associated with the collapse . the largest difference between equal and unequal - mass cases",
    "is also found for the h4 eos .",
    "the amplitude for mass ratio @xmath25 shows a pronounced second minimum , while for the equal - mass model it decreases monotonically .",
    "one possible explanation for this general type of behavior would be the excitation of an unstable oscillation mode while the original mode excited during merger is damped .",
    "this seems unlikely since the phase velocity remains smooth , which would not be the case when two different modes with comparable amplitude are present at the same time .",
    "another possibility is that the original mode becomes unstable due to an increase of compactness and frequency .",
    "this is also unconvincing since the mode frequencies span the same range for both mass ratios . in case of a cfs unstable mode ,",
    "the inertial - frame frequency should also be small near the critical rotation rate .",
    "we favor an explanation recently proposed in @xcite , namely that the density deformation is partly due to vortices in the fluid flow , and that these can undergo both smooth and sudden rearrangements .",
    "this could also explain smaller irregularities of the strain amplitude .",
    "the hypothesis is not proven , in particular it is possible that vortex rearrangements and frequency changes have a common cause instead . however , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : rot ] , we do see for the h4 unequal - mass case a clear rearrangement of the remnant structure in the frame corotating with the @xmath26 density deformation ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig : h4q09_traj_xy ] ) . also , we found that the contributions of the outer layers and the core to the quadrupole moment have opposite sign .",
    "this might lead to cancellation effects amplifying the impact of rearrangements on the gw amplitude .     for the apr4 models , compared to the sensitivity curves of current and planned gravitational wave detectors . ]    , but for the ms1 models . ]    , but for the h4 models .",
    "note the differences in the high - frequency part are simply due to the fact that the unequal - mass case was not evolved long enough to obtain the part of the signal corresponding to the collapse to a black hole . ]",
    "the effect of the magnetic field on gw strain and phase velocity is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gw_strain_bcomp ] for the equal - mass apr4 model .",
    "we find very little difference in this case .",
    "note that the impact for a remnant closer to collapse could be larger since near the threshold for bh formation the system tends to be very sensitive to small changes .",
    "in particular , the lifetime of the remnant could be altered significantly .",
    "the fourier spectra of the gw signals are shown in figures  [ fig : gw_spec_apr4 ] to  [ fig : gw_spec_h4 ] , each comparing the equal- and unequal - mass models for one eos .",
    "the main peak caused by the post - merger phase shows only minor changes for different mass ratios , compared to the width of the peak .",
    "the impact of the eos exceeds by far that of the mass ratio , at least in the range @xmath27 to @xmath28 .",
    "we note that a small influence of the mass ratio makes it easier to constrain the eos from the post - merger frequency .",
    "correlations between eos , initial ns properties , and post - merger frequencies have been studied by different groups , e.g. @xcite , for a large number of models .    in all cases ,",
    "the post - merger peak as well as the inspiral contribution are above the ( design ) sensitivity curves of the advanced ligo and virgo detectors .",
    "nevertheless , the corresponding signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) is likely insufficient for a confident detection of the post - merger signal at @xmath29 distance .",
    "of the three eos , the apr4 eos leads to the post - merger signal with the smallest snr .",
    "although the h4 models emit the strongest post - merger signals ( see discussion above ) , their frequency is also higher , such that the ms1 and h4 cases result in comparable snrs .",
    "the dominant frequency of the post - merger phase for each model is given in table  [ tab : outcome ] .",
    "we report both the location @xmath30 of the maximum in the fourier spectrum as well as a measure defined in @xcite using the instantaneous frequency @xmath31 to compute @xmath32 where the time integrals are carried out over the first @xmath33 after merger .",
    "interestingly , the gw frequency in the post - merger phase is approximately twice the maximum rotation rate inside the remnant ( compare @xmath34 and @xmath30 in table  [ tab : outcome ] , as well as fig .  [",
    "fig : rot_max ] ) . as was already observed in @xcite , the maximum rotation rate",
    "is apparently limited by the angular velocity of the @xmath26 density deformation , which is in turn half of the gw frequency .",
    "the frequency of the main post - merger peak increases with the bulk compactness of the remnant ( as does the rotation rate , see sec .  [",
    "sec : rot ] ) , which depends on the eos .",
    "when considering the characteristic low- and high - frequency side peaks appearing around the main post - merger peak , we find more significant differences between the equal and unequal - mass cases .",
    "we caution however that those peaks are not necessarily related directly to physical oscillations .",
    "as was already shown in @xcite , their location can change drastically when removing the aforementioned phase jumps .",
    "this can be explained in terms of cancellations between the contributions of different parts of the signal to the fourier spectrum .",
    "the impact of the magnetic field on the spectrum is rather small , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gw_spec_apr4 ] .",
    "we observe a slight shift of the main peak , which is however less than the peak width .",
    "the sub - structure of the peak also changes slightly , such that a sub - peak at @xmath35 becomes the new global maximum for the non - magnetic case .",
    "the average frequency @xmath36 changes less than @xmath37 .",
    "also the amplitude of the peak and the corresponding snr is essentially unaffected by the magnetic field .",
    "overall , we conclude that _ magnetic fields up to the strength considered here are unlikely to cause any detectable changes in the gw signal for bns mergers forming a long - lived ns_.",
    "in this paper , we investigated the merger of bns systems by means of grmhd simulations , with special attention devoted to mergers producing a long - lived ns remnant ( i.e.  a supramassive or stable ns ) .",
    "we considered equal and unequal mass binaries with mass ratios @xmath38 and @xmath39 , keeping a fixed total gravitational mass at infinity of @xmath40 .",
    "we considered three different eos known in the literature : apr4 , ms1 , and h4 .",
    "for the given total mass , these eos lead to the formation of supramassive , stable , and hypermassive ns remnants , respectively . only the latter models ( h4 eos ) collapse to a bh by the end of our simulations , which cover the evolution up to @xmath41@xmath42  ms after merger .    .",
    "we studied in detail the structure and the fluid flow of the merger remnants . in a frame corotating with the dominant @xmath26 density deformation",
    ", the remnant structure appears much more complex than simple differential rotation . in particular , we found long - standing vortices correlated with density perturbations , which slowly evolve towards axisymmetry . in the h4 unequal - mass case , we also found a sudden rearrangement of the internal flow starting @xmath43  ms after merger , which seems to have an impact on the hmns lifetime and to leave a distinctive signature on gw signal and mass ejection .    for the long - lived models ,",
    "a quasi - stationary state is reached around @xmath24 . for all models ,",
    "the rotation profiles on the equatorial plane around this time shows a generic structure with a slowly rotating core , a maximum rotation rate at a radius of @xmath44@xmath45 , and an approximately keplerian rotation profile in the outer layers .",
    "this confirms previous indications suggesting that the collapse is not prevented by a rapidly rotating core , but rather by the centrifugal support of the outer layers of the remnant .",
    "the eos is found to have a much stronger impact than the mass ratio on the maximum angular velocity , which is approximately given by the angular velocity of the @xmath26 density perturbation .",
    "moreover , we found that the slowly rotating core is well approximated by the core of a tov ( i.e.  non - rotating ns ) solution and that bns merger remnants seem to resist the collapse as long as a tov core equivalent is admitted .",
    "our h4 models indeed collapse to bh as soon as this condition is no longer satisfied .    for our collapsing ( h4 ) models , we found bhs with spin parameter of @xmath46 surrounded by accretion disks of @xmath47 . in the long - lived ns cases ( apr4 and ms1 )",
    ", we found a significant amount of mass outside the remnant at radii @xmath48 : @xmath49 and @xmath50 for the apr4 and ms1 models , respectively ( roughly half of which outside a radius of @xmath51  km ) .",
    "we note that further away from the remnant the matter is distributed more isotropically ( i.e.  also along the orbital axis ) and its internal flow is rather unordered and does not correspond to simple accretion , at least on the timescales covered by our simulations ( @xmath52  ms after merger ) .",
    "we also note that a small fraction of this mass will be ejected from the system . as a general trend ,",
    "unequal - mass systems are found to produce more massive disks ( by @xmath53% in the long - lived ns cases , and @xmath54% in the collapsing cases ) .    .",
    "the evolution of magnetic fields is characterized by different stages of amplification .",
    "we started from initial poloidal fields of @xmath55  g confined inside the two nss and we observed a first stage of amplification taking place already before merger .",
    "interestingly , all models started with the same total magnetic energy and gravitational mass at infinity , and all ended up with roughly the same magnetic energy at the time of merger , which is about one order of magnitude higher than the initial one .",
    "nevertheless , it is still unclear whether this amplification corresponds to a well - resolved physical mechanism , although our analysis ruled out a number of physical and numerical causes .",
    "a possible explanation might be that the time - changing tidal deformations during inspiral induce fluid flows inside the two nss that might amplify the magnetic field .",
    "this effect will be further investigated in future studies .",
    "after merger , magnetic fields are strongly amplified for @xmath56@xmath33 , most likely by the kh instability .",
    "further amplification continues at later times , although at a lower rates . in this last phase ,",
    "the mri outside the ns remnant is likely playing a major role in the amplification . from our resolution study , it is clear that the kh phase is not well resolved .",
    "however , the magnetic energy achieved in last stage ( up to @xmath57 after merger for the long - lived ns models ) shows a much better convergence .",
    "the overall dependence on eos and mass ratio is non - trivial and no general trend is observed . at all stages ,",
    "the magnetic field amplification is mostly in the toroidal component and takes place mostly on the equatorial plane .",
    "we studied the geometrical distribution of magnetic fields in 3d for the long - lived ns cases , and found that no ordered configuration has emerged around the orbital axis by the end of our simulations , although we note a slight tendency to helical structures .    .",
    "we discussed how our results compare with different scenarios linking bns mergers to the central engine of sgrbs .",
    "in particular , we considered the leading bh - disk scenario and the alternative magnetar scenario .",
    "both models envisage the formation of an accretion - powered jet launched by the post - merger system , i.e.  a bh surrounded by a massive accretion disk in the former case and a strongly magnetized long - lived ns also surrounded by an accretion disk in the latter case . while not much can be added on the standard bh - disk scenario from our collapsing ( h4 ) models , since the simulations were interrupted only a few ms after bh formation , our long - lived ns ( apr4 and ms1 ) models provided useful indications on the viability of the magnetar scenario .",
    "we note that so far this case has been poorly investigated in numerical relativity , with only very few studies reporting on grmhd simulations of bns mergers with long - lived ns remnants .",
    "we found that @xmath58  ms after merger , the long - lived ns is still surrounded by a dense and nearly isotropic environment .",
    "in particular , baryon pollution along the orbital axis is substantial ( densities of @xmath59  g/@xmath60 ) and could easily prevent the formation of an incipient jet .",
    "in addition , there is no well defined accretion flow nor an ordered magnetic field structure that could favor the launch of a collimated outflow .",
    "we thus concluded that the long - lived ns systems considered are not able to produce a jet , at least on timescales of @xmath61  s. as we discussed , however , such a conclusion could be affected by our present limitations .    .",
    "we carried out a detailed analysis of the matter ejected during and after merger .",
    "we estimated the outflow of matter that is unbound according to the geodesic criterion and we found dynamical ejecta composed by ( i ) initial tidal tails launched right before merger that are more massive for the unequal - mass models , ( ii ) a strong ejecta wave , most likely due to the breakout shock generated when the two ns cores collide , and ( iii ) additional ejecta waves launched by the first oscillations of the remnant ns . in total , these ejecta amount to @xmath62 for the apr4 models and @xmath63 for the others . within the errors ,",
    "magnetic fields have negligible effect on these results . using a simple analytical model by grossman et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , we also obtained order - of - magnitude estimates for the corresponding kilonova / macronova signals .",
    "we found electromagnetic transients peaking around @xmath28@xmath23 days after merger , with peak luminosities of @xmath64  erg / s and effective temperatures of @xmath65@xmath66  k.    in addition to the formally unbound ejecta , we observed further matter outflows .",
    "these become dominant @xmath67@xmath24 after merger and , although slower , they can contribute significantly to the total flux accumulated by the end of the simulations across a spherical surface of radius @xmath68 . in particular , for the long - lived ns cases @xmath57 after merger , the cumulative flux of formally bound matter can be comparable to the unbound ejecta ( apr4 ) or even dominant ( ms1 ) .",
    "moreover , by comparing results obtained with and without magnetic fields , we found that the main contribution to these outflows is magnetically driven .",
    "this indicates that the geodesic criterion does not apply and leaves the possibility that a relevant fraction of this matter could also become unbound at later times .",
    "finally , our simulations suggest that the ongoing matter ejection will persist for much longer .    . for all our models",
    ", we analyzed the gw signal , with particular attention to the post - merger waveform and spectrum .",
    "systems forming a long - lived ns ( apr4 and ms1 models ) have post - merger waveforms of similar amplitudes which rapidly decay within @xmath69 . the collapsing ( h4 )",
    "models show a stronger post - merger gw emission that is however shut off as soon as the hmns collapses to a bh .",
    "we note that all models exhibit a phase jump during merger , which might be relevant for gw analysis . in agreement with well established results in the literature , we found post - merger spectra characterized by a main peak at a frequency of @xmath70@xmath71  khz .",
    "while the mass ratio has minor influence on this frequency , differences are significant for different eos .",
    "in particular , more compact remnants have a higher peak frequency .",
    "we recall that all our bns systems have the same total mass at infinite separation . by comparing the spectra of the magnetized and non - magnetized apr4 equal - mass models",
    ", we concluded that for bns merger forming a long - lived ns , magnetic fields up to @xmath72  g are unlikely to alter the gw spectrum in a detectable way .",
    "although for all our models the main post - merger peak lies above the sensitivity curves of advanced ligo and virgo , the snrs are most probably not sufficient for a confident detection of the post - merger part of the gw signal at a distance of @xmath73  mpc or more .    .",
    "with the present work , we initiated a systematic investigation of bns mergers leading to the formation of a long - lived ns .",
    "as suggested by recent observations , this case might represent a significant fraction of all bns mergers .",
    "nevertheless , it remains poorly studied in numerical relativity and thus more effort in this direction is urgently needed .",
    "the results presented here are affected by various limitations that should be overcome step by step in the future .",
    "these certainly include , among others , the absence of neutrino emission and absorption , which likely affect the structure and properties of the ns remnant and surrounding disk / environment , enhance the matter outflows , and play an important role in creating the conditions to launch a jet and power a sgrb .",

    ", we roughly estimate the mass of the unbound ejecta to be accurate within a factor of 2 .",
    "finally , we consider the impact of resolution on magnetic field evolution and amplification .",
    "figure  [ fig : mag_1d_res ] shows the evolution of the total magnetic energy for low , medium and high resolution .",
    "the initial amplification during the inspiral seems to converge until the saturation phase , where the absolute differences become suddenly larger and convergence is gradually lost .",
    "this could mean that the saturation is due to the finite resolution or that a physical effect causing the saturation is more difficult to resolve .",
    "we note that a resolution study does not allow us to exclude the remote possibility that interaction with the artificial atmosphere is responsible for the amplification .",
    "as expected , in the post - merger phase we are not in a regime of convergence .",
    "this is likely due to the unresolved small - scales at which the key amplification mechanisms act ( in particular the kh instability ) .",
    "nevertheless , for @xmath94 we find a much better agreement between the medium and high resolutions compared to the low and medium resolutions .",
    "a possible explanation is that magnetic energy in this late phase is dominated by the contributions of mri and winding outside the remnant , which are much better resolved ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mri ] , the resolution should be sufficient to resolve the fastest growing mri modes ) .",

    "<S> merging binary neutron stars ( bnss ) represent the ultimate targets for multimessenger astronomy , being among the most promising sources of gravitational waves ( gws ) , and , at the same time , likely accompanied by a variety of electromagnetic counterparts across the entire spectrum , possibly including short gamma - ray bursts ( sgrbs ) and kilonova / macronova transients . numerical relativity simulations </S>",
    "<S> play a central role in the study of these events . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , given the importance of magnetic fields , various aspects of this investigation require general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics ( grmhd ) . so far , most grmhd simulations focused the attention on bns mergers leading to the formation of a hypermassive ns , which , in turn , collapses within few tens of ms into a black hole surrounded by an accretion disk . however , recent observations suggest that a significant fraction of these systems could form a long - lived ns remnant , which will either collapse on much longer timescales or remain indefinitely stable . despite the profound implications for the evolution and the emission properties of the system , a detailed investigation of this alternative evolution channel is still missing . here , we follow this direction and present a first detailed grmhd study of bns mergers forming a long - lived ns . </S>",
    "<S> we consider magnetized binaries with different mass ratios and equations of state and analyze the structure of the ns remnants , the rotation profiles , the accretion disks , the evolution and amplification of magnetic fields , and the ejection of matter . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we discuss the connection with the central engine of sgrbs and provide order - of - magnitude estimates for the kilonova / macronova signal . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we study the gw emission , with particular attention to the post - merger phase . </S>"
