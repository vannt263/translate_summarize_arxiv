    "complexes of small molecules with variable number of para - hydrogen ( @xmath3-h@xmath4 ) molecules pose a challenging and fascinating arena for the manifestation of nuclear quantum effects on structure and spectroscopy . like their better known analogous helium clusters , para - hydrogen clusters are expected to be strongly influenced by the quantum nature of the @xmath3-h@xmath4 molecules .",
    "the mass of @xmath3-h@xmath4 being one half that of @xmath5he actually suggests that larger zero point effects might be expected .",
    "however , the greater binding of @xmath3-h@xmath4 to itself and to other species means that the greater delocalization tendency of @xmath3-h@xmath4 competes with greater localizing potential energy terms .",
    "the competition between these two strong effects is what causes both calculation and analysis of para - hydrogen clusters and complexes to be considerably more difficult than that for analogous helium systems . like helium ,",
    "para - hydrogen is a boson , but because of the greater binding energy , @xmath3-h@xmath4 solidifies in the bulk before cooling to a low enough temperature for macroscopic manifestation of the boson permutation exchange symmetry to occur with a superfluid phase .",
    "however , in finite clusters vestiges of superfluidity may occur , particularly when the para - hydrogen packing is expanded or otherwise constrained by the reduced dimensionality and/or the @xmath3-h@xmath4 molecules are bound to foreign species .",
    "the linear ocs molecule has played a key role in developing our understanding of the fundamental forces controlling the properties of @xmath3-h@xmath4 complexes .",
    "experimental studies with ocs complexed by variable numbers of para - hydrogen ( @xmath6 ) and embedded in helium droplets have shown a very rich spectroscopic behavior , with both vibrational shifts and rotational fine structure providing indirect information on the symmetry and distribution of the @xmath3-h@xmath4 around the ocs molecule @xcite . in helium ,",
    "the rotational spectra of the para - hydrogen complexes are well fit by asymmetric tops for @xmath0=1 - 4 , while larger clusters appear adequately described by a symmetric top hamiltonian @xcite . for certain sizes , @xmath0=5 , 6 , 11 , 14 - 16",
    ", no @xmath7-branch is seen in the spectra . for the larger sizes , @xmath0=14 - 16 ,",
    "this disappearance is temperature dependent , which led to the suggestion that it might be a manifestation of superfluidity in the para - hydrogen component .",
    "path integral monte carlo calculations for a complete solvation shell ( @xmath0=17 ) have shown that a transition to an anisotropic superfluid state is indeed found at temperatures below t@xmath8  k , and that this can account for the disappearance of the @xmath7-branch for @xmath9 @xcite . however , for the smaller sizes , the spectral anomaly is independent of temperature . in the absence of detailed knowledge of the structure and rigidity of the complex , the microscopic origin of this anomaly is less clear , although the permutation symmetry can also be expected to play a role .",
    "much less is known experimentally about the complexes of ocs with para - hydrogen in the absence of a solvating helium environment .",
    "the ocs(@xmath3-h@xmath4 ) dimes has been characterized by high resolution spectroscopy @xcite , and its strcuture has been shown to be approximate with that of an asymmetric top rotor .",
    "the structure of this dimer is very similar in the gas phase and in a helium droplet @xcite . for complexes with larger numbers of para - hydrogen molecules ,",
    "no spectroscopic data have been published .",
    "we expect that ocs complexed by 1  @xmath10  17 para - hydrogen molecules will show a very rich variation in structure , energetics , and spectroscopic properties , as a consequence of the strongly modulated solvating hydrogen density along the axis of the ocs molecule seen in path integral calculations for @xmath1117 @xcite .",
    "these modulations are considerably stronger than those found in the analogous complexes of ocs with helium @xcite because of the stronger ( @xmath3-h@xmath4)-ocs and ( @xmath3-h@xmath4)-(@xmath3-h@xmath4 ) interactions .",
    "consequently we can expect a considerably more complex size dependence of the spectroscopic properties for the complexes with @xmath3-h@xmath4 as the first solvation shell is filled .",
    "the small complexes of ocs with helium have recently been shown to undergo a transition from near rigid molecular complex behavior to true quantum ( or `` superfluid '' ) solvation characterized by permutation exchanges along the molecular axis , as the number of helium atoms increases from @xmath0=1 to @xmath0=20 @xcite .",
    "given the recent demonstration of anisotropic superfluidity in ocs(@xmath3-h@xmath4)@xmath12 @xcite , we expect an analogous transition for complexes with molecular hydrogen .",
    "however , the considerably greater competition between quantum ( kinetic ) delocalization and ( potential ) localization for para - hydrogen renders even qualitative prediction of the spectroscopic behavior impossible without detailed microscopic calculations .",
    "furthermore , for the intermediate sizes 1  @xmath10  17 , the properties of gas phase ocs(@xmath3-h@xmath4)@xmath12 complexes and their analogous embedded in helium droplets can be expected to show maximal differences , since this is the size regime in which subtle changes in para - hydrogen and helium density distributions can give rise to significant energy differences .    in this paper",
    "we present results of ground and excited state calculations for ocs complexed with @xmath0=1 - 8 para - hydrogen molecules , as part of a larger systematic study of the complexes with up to a complete solvation shell @xcite .",
    "we employ two kinds of zero temperature quantum monte carlo methods , the diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) and the projection operator imaginary time spectral evolution ( poitse ) approach .",
    "these microscopic calculations provide energy levels and rotational and distortion constants , in addition to energetics and ground state structures .",
    "we find a very interesting variation in structure for this series of small complexes , showing considerably more inhomogeneous behavior than the analogous series of complexes of ocs with @xmath5he .",
    "we determine the structure both along the molecular axis and around it , with analysis of para - hydrogen pair correlation functions and find that this allows us to provide a good description of the extent of localization in the ground state .",
    "the excited state energies are extracted from a maximum entropy analysis of the imaginary time correlation functions derived from the poitse approach .",
    "we find that a simple multi - exponential fit of these correlations functions provides similar results , but with larger uncertainties .",
    "analysis of the fitted spectral constants resulting from the excited state energies reveals a gradual change of symmetry of the ocs(@xmath3-h@xmath4)@xmath13 complexes as @xmath0 increases , which is accompanied by a monotonic decrease in the effective rotational constant over this size range . while overall the analysis of spectral constants indicates more rigid structures for these ocs complexes with para - hydrogen than those with helium , the fitted spectral constants nevertheless show a markedly strong appearance of floppy , non - rigid structures for both the @xmath0=3 and @xmath0=4 complexes .",
    "we discuss these structures and predicted spectroscopic constants in relation to available experimental data and in the context of the analogous ocs(@xmath5he)@xmath14 complexes @xcite .",
    "the total interaction potential for the ocs(@xmath3-h@xmath4)@xmath14 clusters is obtained as a sum of all pairwise contributions , neglecting the effects of three - body forces among the para - hydrogen molecules , while correctly treating the many - body interaction between the linear ocs impurity molecule and each @xmath3-h@xmath4 molecule one at a time .",
    "because of its nuclear spin symmetry ( i=0 ) , para - hydrogen can only access even values of its angular momentum , i.e. , @xmath15=0 , 2 , 4 , etc .",
    "furthermore , given the large spacing between the rotational levels , @xmath15 can generally be assumed to be a good quantum number in the weakly bound van der waals complexes  @xcite .",
    "these considerations , together with the fact that our calculations are carried out at a temperature of 0  k , allow us to consider each @xmath3-h@xmath4 molecule as being in its @xmath15=0 rotational state .",
    "therefore , in the present study , we treat the para - hydrogen molecules as spherical particles .",
    "the total interaction potential can then be expressed as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a generic vector that defines the coordinates of all the particles .",
    "therefore , @xmath18 is the distance between @xmath3-h@xmath4 molecules @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , @xmath22 are the jacobi coordinates of the @xmath19th para - hydrogen molecule in the center of mass frame of the ocs ( see fig .  [",

    "it is also important to note that when @xmath0=4 , the ocs axis more closely approximates the axis of symmetry for the whole cluster , and hence @xmath164 becomes constant in time also for the higher values of @xmath130 .    from these considerations",

    "the relatively substantial values of @xmath2 for @xmath0=3 - 4 are due to the distortion of the ring deriving from coupling to the ring `` breathing '' mode , described in section  iii.b.2 above .",
    "as noted there , for @xmath0=5 - 6 five hydrogen molecules are now locked in the ring , which will push this breathing mode higher in energy and reduce its amplitude , thereby reducing the effects of its coupling to the cluster rotation .",

    "thus , for @xmath189 the rotational spectra correspond to those of slightly asymmetric prolate rotors with significant centrifugal distortion for @xmath0=3 - 4 that is assigned to coupling of the rotational motion to a `` breathing '' mode vibration of the partially filled para - hydrogen ring .",
    "this coupling is suppressed at @xmath0=5 when the ring is complete and the ( @xmath3-h@xmath4)-(@xmath3-h@xmath4 ) interactions effectively lock the para - hydrogen molecules into a more rigid structure . for @xmath1 prolate symmetric top spectra",
    "are therefore obtained with negligible distortion constants .",
    "some quantitative inaccuracies in the ccqa - dmc method were seen to arise when the second ring is growing ( @xmath0=7 - 8 ) and when the cluster is highly symmetric ( @xmath0=5 ) .    comparison with the experimental data for the @xmath0=1 ocs(@xmath3-h@xmath4 ) complex shows excellent quantitative agreement for both the energy levels and the structural parameters . for @xmath190",
    "no experimental data are available for the pure ocs(@xmath3-h@xmath4)@xmath14 clusters .",
    "a qualitative comparison of the main features of the cluster structures with conclusions drawn from the experimental results for the ocs(@xmath3-h@xmath4)@xmath14 clusters in the mixed @xmath5he/@xmath185he droplets shows good agreement , with the main difference being the helium - induced modification of the @xmath0=6 structure from a 5-membered to 6-membered ring .",
    "the rigidity of the highly symmetric @xmath0=5 structure provides strong support for the arguments that excited states of this are restricted by nuclear permutation symmetry , resulting in a lack of @xmath7-branch in the ocs rotational spectrum at low temperatures @xcite .",
