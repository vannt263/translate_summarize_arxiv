    "<S> the temperature of the atomic matter in the universe is held to that of the cosmic background radiation until decoupling at @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> after this it cools faster than the radiation ( @xmath1 rather than @xmath2 ) and would have fallen to about @xmath3mk today if astrophysical feedback processes had not heated up the interglactic medium . </S>",
    "<S> we show how the derivative of the compton coupling equation helps numerically to follow the decoupling process .    </S>",
    "<S> atomic processes  cosmology : cosmic microwave background  cosmology : early universe    at early times atoms are coupled to cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons through compton scattering . in an expanding universe matter </S>",
    "<S> would ` like ' to cool as @xmath4 , i.e.  _ faster _ than the radiation , which varies with redshift @xmath5 as @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> however , compton coupling prevents the matter cooling this rapidly until the partial ionization of the atoms has fallen enough that the compton heating timescale becomes long compared with the hubble time . so </S>",
    "<S> although cosmological recombination is often referred to as ` decoupling ' , the huge photon bath prevents matter decoupling from the radiation until much later . </S>",
    "<S> the cmb ` last scattering ' epoch is at @xmath7 , while matter does not really start to cool adiabatically until @xmath8 .    using the _ wmap _ markov chains to account for the variation in the cosmological model , </S>",
    "<S> parameters we find that @xmath9 would be @xmath10kelvin , if there had been no additional sources of heat . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the asymptotic behaviour is the same as if the matter had instantaneously departed from the radiation at @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> of course the growth of non - linear structure at @xmath12 and subsequent feedback of gravitational and nuclear energy leads to intergalactic medium temperatures in today s universe which are much _ higher _ than the cmb temperature .    although we found the uncertainty on today s @xmath9 by considering the variation among currently acceptable cosmological model parameters , probably a bigger uncertainty lies in the actual physics of recombination at low redshift . </S>",
    "<S> some simple algebra shows that @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the free electron fraction ( normalized to hydrogen by @xmath15 ) which ` freezes out ' at low redshift . the additional uncertainty in @xmath9 due to @xmath14 is then expected to be of the order 24% ( see for example  @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the explicit equation governing the kinetic temperature of the matter ( here meaning electrons plus ions plus atoms , with dark matter being uncoupled ) is given by equation ( 66 ) in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ignoring the negligible atomic cooling processes ( bremsstrahlung , collisions , etc . ) </S>",
    "<S> we have : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the hubble parameter evaluated at epoch @xmath5 and @xmath18 here the prime denotes differentiation with respect to redshift , @xmath19 is the thomson cross - section , @xmath20 is the radiation constant ( @xmath21 ) and @xmath22 is the fractional abundance of helium by number ( assumed ionized here for simplicity , but correctly dealt with in the full recombination codes ) .    </S>",
    "<S> clearly @xmath9 is slightly below @xmath23 at early epochs , with the difference kept at just the right value for compton heating to make the matter track the radiation . </S>",
    "<S> the small imbalance is also important because it produces a ` compton drag ' force on the matter particles . </S>",
    "<S> an estimate of this temperature difference appears to have been first been mentioned by @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> he states ( equation 20 ) without proof that @xmath24    further discussion of this temperature difference is given by @xcite , whose result is @xmath25 where we have converted to our notation . </S>",
    "<S> this has the approximately right redshift dependence and ionization dependence , although differences in assumptions about the cosmological model make it difficult to compare the coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> still , this result is essentially correct .    </S>",
    "<S> the difference between matter and radiation temperatures was also included in the textbook of @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> he writes a version of equation  ( [ eq : dtdz ] ) and states ` because the coefficient in the last term is so very large we get a good approximation to the solution by setting @xmath26 ' ( converting to our notation ) , hence finding that @xmath27 this is a good order of magnitude estimate , agreeing ( in essence ) with @xcite , but it is worth pointing out that @xmath28 would be a much better approximation than @xmath26 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us write @xmath29 at early times , with @xmath30 having the dimensions of temperature and fixing @xmath6 at all times . </S>",
    "<S> then the solution to equation  ( [ eq : dtdz ] ) is simply @xmath31 in the limit @xmath32 ( and ignoring helium ) this is half of the expression in peebles ( 1971 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the same result is obtained in a rather different way in the appendix of @xcite .    with this approximation in hand </S>",
    "<S> we can write down an expression for the evolution of the matter temperature by differentiating equation  ( [ eq : tmp ] ) : @xmath33 \\right\\}. \\label{eq : depsdz}\\ ] ] this expression is useful for improving the numerical accuracy of the solution to the matter temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the last two terms ( in square brackets ) are of similar magnitude and track each other at high redshift , hence can be combined . </S>",
    "<S> the second term depends on the derivative of the ionization fraction , and so contributes differently as a function of redshift . </S>",
    "<S> together the derivative in equation  ( [ eq : depsdz ] ) can be used to evolve the matter temperature to quite high accuracy until the departure of @xmath9 from @xmath23 stops being small .    . </S>",
    "<S> ]    in solving the coupled recombination equations one does not really need to follow @xmath9 explicitly at early times . in the commonly used code recfast @xcite @xmath9 is set to @xmath23 until @xmath34 reaches some predefined value , and the full equation  ( [ eq : dtdz ] ) is switched on afterwards ( typically at @xmath35 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a ` glitch ' in the solution ( pointed out in @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> we found that this glitch is easily removed by following equation  ( [ eq : depsdz ] ) instead of just @xmath36 before the switch , and then solving the full equation  ( [ eq : dtdz ] ) afterwards . </S>",
    "<S> the results are shown in fig .  1 . </S>",
    "<S> the change in ionization fraction , roughly @xmath37 at @xmath38 , leads to a @xmath39 correction to the cmb power spectrum @xmath40s when using recfast in a boltzmann code . </S>",
    "<S> it may seem that unnecessary calculations are being carried out by explicitly integrating the matter temperature at early times , but in fact the integrator is already so fast that there is negligible effect on the speed at which recfast runs . </S>"
