    "the rest of our paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 is devoted to the basic feature of flavor mixing in the @xmath0-@xmath1 reflection symmetry and an extended discussion of how to embed it to the seesaw mechanism . in section 3 ,",
    "we systematically analyze the rg running effects in both analytical and numerical approaches .",
    "in general , these effects can be divided into two parts : @xmath0-@xmath1 symmetric and anti - symmetric .",
    "we summarize our results in section 4 .",
    "given any neutrino mass matrix @xmath37 in the form of eq .",
    "that preserves the @xmath0-@xmath1 reflection symmetry , we do the following transformation @xmath38 with @xmath39 and `` re '' and `` i m '' denoting the real and imaginary parts , respectively .",

    "one can assume another generalized cp transformation different from that in eq .   in the right - handed neutrino sector @xmath69 .",
    "the different generalized cp transformation just corresponds to a different choice of the right - handed neutrino flavor basis , if there is no other special flavor structure imposed on the right - handed neutrino sector .",
    "the dirac mass matrix @xmath70 and the right - handed majarana mass matrix @xmath71 invariant under the above transformation must take the following forms : @xmath72 note that @xmath70 is not necessarily a symmetric matrix , where only @xmath73 is real and @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 are complex .",
