    "time integrated @xmath0-violating asymmetries of singly - cabibbo transitions as @xmath8 and @xmath9 are powerful probes of new physics ( np ) . contribution to these decays from `` penguin '' amplitudes are negligible in the standard model ( sm ) , but presence of np particles could enhance the size of @xmath0-violation with respect to the sm expectation .",
    "any asymmetry significantly larger than few @xmath10 , as expected in the ckm hierarchy , may unambiguously indicate new physics contributions @xcite .",
    "we present a measurement of time - integrated @xmath0  violating asymmetry in the cabibbo - suppressed @xmath8 decay : @xmath11 the measured integrated asymmetry , owing to the slow mixing rate of charm mesons , reduces at first order to a sum of two terms : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the proper decay time in unit of @xmath14 lifetime ( @xmath15 ps ) .",
    "the first term arises from direct and the second one from mixing - induced cp violation .",
    "the integration in eq .",
    "is performed over the observed distribution of proper decay time , @xmath16 . since the value of @xmath17 depends strongly on @xmath16 , different values of @xmath18",
    "could be observed in different experimental environments because of different sensitivities to @xmath19 or @xmath20 .",
    "since the trigger used in this analysis imposes requirements on minimum impact parameters of the @xmath14 decay particles , our sample is enriched of higher - valued proper decay time candidates with respect to b - factory experiments .",
    "this makes this analysis more sensitive to mixing - induced cp violation .",
    "the cdf  ii detector @xcite is a magnetic spectrometer surrounded by calorimeters and muon detectors .",
    "it provides a determination of the decay point of particles with 15 @xmath21 m resolution in the transverse plane using six layers of double - sided silicon - microstrip sensors at radii between 2.5 and 22 cm from the beam .",
    "a @xmath22-layer drift chamber extending radially from 40 to 140 cm from the beam provides excellent momentum resolution , yielding approximately 8 mev / c@xmath23 mass resolution for two body charm decays .",
    "a three - level trigger system selects events enriched in decays of long - lived particles by exploiting the presence of displaced tracks in the event and measuring their impact parameter with offline - like 30 @xmath21 m resolution .",
    "the trigger requires presence of two charged particles with transverse momenta greater than @xmath24  gev / c , impact parameters greater than @xmath25 microns and basic cuts on azimuthal separation and scalar sum of momenta .",
    "we updated and improved an early run ii analysis @xcite , using an event sample collected with the trigger on impact parameter from march 2001 to january 2010 that corresponds at about @xmath1  fb@xmath2 of integrated luminosity .",
    "we measure the asymmetry in singly - cabibbo suppressed @xmath8 decays from @xmath26 through fits of the @xmath27 and @xmath28 distributions .",
    "the observed asymmetry include a possible tiny contribution from actual cp violation , diluted in much larger effects from instrumental charge - asymmetries .",
    "indeed the layout of the main tracker detector , the drift chamber , is intrinsically charge asymmetric due to a @xmath29 tilt angle of the cells from the radial direction @xcite , thus different detection efficiencies for positive and negative low - momentum tracks induce an instrumental asymmetry in the number of reconstructed @xmath30-tagged @xmath14 and @xmath31 mesons .",
    "other possible asymmetries may originate in slightly different performance of pattern - reconstruction and track - fitting algorithms for negative and positive particles .",
    "the combined effect of these is a net asymmetry in the range of a few percents .",
    "this must be corrected to better than one per mil to match the expected statistical precision of the present measurement .",
    "we exploit a fully data - driven method that uses higher statistic samples of @xmath30-tagged ( indicated with an asterisk ) and untagged cabibbo - favored @xmath7 decays to correct for all detector effects thus suppressing systematic uncertainties to below the statistical ones .",
    "the uncorrected `` raw '' asymmetries in the three samples can be written as a sum of several ( assumed small ) contributions : @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the actual physical asymmetries ; @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the instrumental asymmetries in reconstructing a positive or negative soft pion associated respectively to a @xmath37 and a @xmath38 charm decay . @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the instrumental asymmetries in reconstructing a @xmath41 or a @xmath42 charm decay respectively for the untagged and the @xmath43tagged case .",
    "the physical asymmetry is extracted by subtracting the instrumental effects through the combination  @xcite : @xmath44 we reconstruct approximately 215,000 @xmath30tagged @xmath8 decays , @xmath45 @xmath30tagged @xmath46 decays and @xmath47 @xmath46 decays where no tag was required .",
    "the much larger statistics of @xmath46 channels , used for correction of instrumental asymmetries , with respect to the signal sample ensures smaller systematic uncertainties than statistical ones on the final result .",
    "we extract independent signal yields for @xmath14 and @xmath31 candidates without using particle identification in the analysis . in the two @xmath30-tagged samples this",
    "is done using the charge of the soft pion . in the untagged @xmath7 sample we randomly divided the sample in two indipendent subsamples similar in size . in each subsample",
    "we calculate the mass of each candidate with a specific mass assignments : @xmath42 in the first subsample and @xmath41 in the second one . thus in one sample the @xmath7 signal is correctly reconstructed and appears as a narrow peak , overlapping a broader peak of the misreconstructed @xmath48 component .",
    "the viceversa applies the other sample .",
    "the raw asymmetry is extracted by fitting the number of candidates populating the two narrow peaks .",
    "we determine the yields by performing a binned fit to the @xmath49-mass ( @xmath50-mass ) distribution combining positive and negative decays of both tagged ( untagged ) samples .",
    "the resulting raw asymmetries are : @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "the analysis technique has been extensively tested on monte carlo simulation using samples simulated with a wide range of physical and detector asymmetries to verify that the cancellation works regardless of the specific configuration .",
    "these studies confirm the validity of our approach and provide a quantitative estimate of possible asymmetries induced by higher order detector effect that may not get fully cancelled or effects of not factorization of @xmath50 and @xmath54 reconstruction efficiencies .",
    "this upper limit is used as systematic uncertainty and amount to @xmath55 .",
    "we evaluate all other systematic uncertainties from data . in most cases ,",
    "this implied varying slightly the shape of the functional forms used in fits , repeating the fit on data , and using the difference between the results of these and the central fit as a systematic uncertainty .",
    "this overestimate the size of the systematic effects because it introduces an additional statistical source of fluctuation in the results .",
    "but we can comfortably afford that given the large event samples size involved .",
    "the dominant contributions to the systematic uncertainties on the asymmetry measurement come from the uncertainty on the differences in charge of the mass shapes , and the uncertainty due to the contamination by charm mesons produced in @xmath56hadron decays ( cp  violating asymmetries in @xmath57 decays induce an asymmetric source of charm and anti - charm mesons ) .",
    "we obtain a total systematic uncertainty on our final @xmath58 measurement of @xmath59 , approximately half of the statistical uncertainty .",
    "we report the measurement of the cp asymmetry in the decay @xmath8 using 5.94 fb@xmath2 of data collected by the cdf displaced track trigger .",
    "the final result is @xmath60\\%,\\ ] ] which is consistent with cp conservation and also with the sm predictions .    to disentangle the independent contributions of direct and indirect cp violation in decays , an analysis where the time evolution of charm decays is studied is needed .",
    "nevertheless some interesting conclusions could be derived either comparing our result with b - factories measurements or making some theoretical assumptions .    ./figs",
    "/ d0pipi_d0_t_fit_nores.eps ( 21,78)(a )    ./figs / combination.eps ( 21,16)(b )",
    "the observed asymmetry is at first order the linear combination of a direct , @xmath19 , and an indirect , @xmath20 , cp violating asymmetry through a coefficient that is the mean proper decay time of @xmath14 candidates in the data sample ( see eq .  , ) .",
    "[ fig : combination ]  ( a ) shows a fit to the mean proper decay time distribution of our tagged sample , the resulting mean value is @xmath61 times the @xmath14 lifetime .",
    "our measurement therefore describes a straight band in the plane @xmath62 with angular coefficient @xmath63 .",
    "the same holds for b - factories measurements , with angular coefficient @xmath64 @xcite , due to their unbiased acceptance in charm decay time .",
    "the three measurements in the plane @xmath62 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : combination ]  ( b ) , where the bands are @xmath65 wide and the red curves represent the @xmath66 and @xmath67 cl limits of the combined result assuming gaussian uncertainties .",

    "note that , since @xmath71 in our sample is greater than in b - factories ones , this range is more than five times tighter than the ones obtained using b - factories measurements .",
    "conversely , assuming @xmath72 , our number is directly comparable to other measurements in different experimental configurations . in this case , our statistical uncertainties are half those from the best b - factories measurements , and also systematic uncertainties are smaller .",
