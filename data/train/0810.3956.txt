    "in 1969 , ( @xcite ) veech found examples of skew products over a rotation of the circle that are minimal but not uniquely ergodic .",

    "when @xmath10 is rational , a result of veech ( @xcite ) implies that minimal directions are uniquely ergodic ; thus @xmath4 is the set of rational directions and is countable . by a general result of masur ( see @xcite ) , the hausdorff dimension of @xmath4 satisfies @xmath15",

    "this raises the question of the situation when @xmath10 is irrational but not diophantine ; namely , when @xmath10 is a liouville number .",

    "that theorem asserts that to each nonergodic direction @xmath21 there is an associated sequence of slits @xmath22 and loops @xmath23 whose directions converge to @xmath5 and satisfy the summability condition ( [ ieq : sumx ] ) .",
    "the natural language to describe the manner by which a sequence of vectors is associated to a nonergodic direction is within the framework of @xmath24-expansions .",
    "( see  [ s : lvdir ] . ) here , @xmath24 denotes a closed discrete subset of @xmath25 satisfying some mild restrictions and in the case when @xmath24 is the set of primitive vectors in @xmath26 this notion reduces to continued fraction expansions .",
    "we also have the notion of _ liouville direction _ ( relative to @xmath24 ) which intuitively refers to a direction that is extremely well approximated by the directions of vectors in @xmath24 .",
    "under fairly general assumptions , which hold for example if @xmath24 is a set of holonomies of saddle connections on a translation surface , the set of liouville directions has hausdorff dimension zero .",
    "( corollary  [ cor : lvdir ] ) the proof of hausdorff dimension @xmath6 then reduces to showing that if @xmath10 satisfies ( [ pm : div ] ) , then every minimal nonergodic direction is liouville with respect to the @xmath24 expansion .",
    "this is stated as lemma  [ lem : ne->lv ] .    for the proof of lemma  [ lem : ne->lv ] the key ingedient is lemma  [ lem : min : area ] , which gives a _ lower bound _ on cross - products .",
    "it is based on the fact that @xmath27 will be an extremely good approximation to @xmath28 provided the interval @xmath29 $ ] is large enough and also contains @xmath30 not too close to @xmath31 .",
    "( see lemma  [ lem : lc ] . )",
    "this idea is motivated by the elementary fact that for any pair of vectors @xmath32 and @xmath33 where @xmath34 with @xmath35 we have @xmath36 unless @xmath37 are parallel to each other , in which case the cross - product vanishes .",
    "we apply lemma  [ lem : min : area ] to the sequence @xmath22 associated by theorem  [ thm : ce ] to a minimal nonergodic direction @xmath5 . if one assumes , by contradiction , that @xmath5 is _",

    "moreover , the number of such slits is at least a fixed constant times @xmath40 .",
    "thus the sum of the cross - products would be at least @xmath41 the sum over those @xmath42 for which @xmath29 $ ] is large . since ( [ pm : div ] ) still holds if the sum is restricted to those @xmath42 , the summable cross - products condition ( [ ieq : sumx ] ) would be contradicted .",
    "this will then show that @xmath5 is liouville and we will conclude that @xmath18 .      the starting point for the dimension @xmath7 argument is theorem  [ thm : sumx ] , which is the specialization of a result from @xcite to the case of @xmath14 that says the summability condition ( [ ieq : sumx ] ) is sufficient to guarantee that the limiting direction of a sequence of slit directions is a nonergodic direction .",
    "one proceeds to construct a cantor set of nonergodic directions arising as a limit of directions of slits on the torus .",
    "aspects of this construction were already carried out in @xcite in the case that @xmath10 is diophantine .",
    "for @xmath44 , let @xmath45 be the set of limiting directions obtained from sequences @xmath22 satisfying @xmath46 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite , under the assumption of diophantine @xmath10 , that one can make the series in ( [ ieq : sumx ] ) be dominated by a geometric series of ratio @xmath47 , and then @xmath48 .",
    "the lower bound @xmath7 then follows by taking the limit as @xmath49 tends to one .",
    "the strategy of bounding cross - products using a geometric series fails if only the weaker diophantine condition ( [ pm : conv ] ) is assumed .",
    "in fact , in the large gaps @xmath50 $ ] , as we have indicated , the cross - product is bounded below by @xmath51 .",
    "so if the gaps are large , ( where the notion of `` large '' is to be made precise later ) then there are many terms with cross - products bounded below by @xmath51 and these terms would eventually become larger than the terms in the geometric series .",
    "this suggests modifying the strategy in @xcite by replacing the geometric series used to dominate the series in ( [ ieq : sumx ] ) with a series whose terms @xmath52 are @xmath53 if @xmath39 lies in a large interval @xmath29 $ ] and are otherwise decreasing like a geometric series of ratio @xmath47 for @xmath54 such that @xmath39 lies between successive large intervals .",
    "the number of slits in @xmath29 $ ] is @xmath55 so that @xmath56 restricted to those @xmath54 for which @xmath39 lies in a large interval @xmath29 $ ] is bounded using the assumption ( [ pm : conv ] ) .",
    "the sum of the remaining terms is bounded by the sum of a geometric series times @xmath57 .",
    "this latter sum is finite .",
    "the finiteness then of @xmath56 and therefore ( [ ieq : sumx ] ) ensures that the resulting set @xmath58 .",
    "following @xcite , we seek to build a tree of slits so that by associating intervals about the direction of each slit in the tree , we can give @xmath45 the structure of a cantor set to which standard techniques can be used to give lower estimates on hausdorff dimension .",
    "these techniques require certain `` local estimates '' ( expressed in terms of lower bounds on the number of subintervals and the size of gaps between them ) hold at each stage of the construction . in  [ s : cantor ] , we express these local estimates in terms of the parameters @xmath49 and @xmath52 .    for slits @xmath59 whose lengths lie in a `` small '' interval @xmath29 $ ] we repeat the construction given in @xcite to construct `` children '' slits from `` parent '' slits .",
    "this is carried out in ",
    "[ s : diophantine ] .",
    "in the current situation we have to combine that construction with a new one to deal with slits lengths that lie between consecutive @xmath60 with large ratio .",
    "we call this the `` liouville '' part of @xmath10 .",
    "the construction of new slits from old ones in that case is carried out in  [ s : liouville ] .",
    "the construction of the tree of slits and the precise definition of the terms @xmath52 are given in ",
    "[ s : init ] and  [ s : tree ] .",
    "these sections are the most technical part of the paper .",
    "the main task is to ensure that the recursive procedure for constructing the tree of slits can be continued indefinitely while at the same time ensuring the required local estimates are satisfied in the case of our two constructions .    finally , in ",
    "[ s : lower ] , we verify that the series @xmath56 is convergent and that the lower bound on @xmath61 can be made arbitrarily close to @xmath7 by choosing the parameter @xmath49 sufficiently close to one .",

    "associated to any translation surface ( or more generally a holomorphic quadratic differential ) is a teichmller geodesic . for each @xmath62 the riemann surface @xmath63 along the geodesic",
    "is found by expanding along horizontal lines by a factor of @xmath64 and contracting along vertical lines by @xmath64 .",
    "it is known ( see @xcite ) that if the vertical foliation of the quadratic differential is nonergodic , then the associated teichmller geodesic is _ divergent _ , i.e. it eventually leaves every compact subset of the stratum .",
    "the converse is however false .",
    "there are divergent geodesics for which the vertical foliation is uniquely ergodic .",
    "in fact , we have    [ thm : divergent ] let @xmath65 denote the set of divergent directions in @xmath1 , i.e. directions for which the associated teichmller geodesic leaves every compact subset of the stratum . remains valid if @xmath65 is interpreted as the set of directions that are divergent in the sense described in the previous footnote .",
