    "recent multi - wavelength observations of afterglows of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) have revealed some puzzling features @xcite , impelling the researches on the afterglow theory .",
    "x - ray observations from _",
    "swift_/xrt @xcite have resulted in diverse light curves , but a canonical light curve consisting of a steep decay , a plateau , and a normal decay phase has been suggested @xcite .",
    "the plateau phase can not be explained in the framework of the simple standard external shock scenario , i.e. synchrotron radiation produced by the interaction of a relativistic ejecta with the circum - burst medium ( see @xcite for reviews ) . on the other hand ,",
    "some optical afterglows show re - brightenings at late stages ( @xmath0 s ) , together with a bump occurring in the x - ray band in some cases ( e.g. , grb 120326a , @xcite ) , or without clear counterpart features in x - rays ( e.g. , grb 100814a , @xcite ; grb 081029 , @xcite ; grb 100621a , @xcite ) .",
    "these re - brightenings also deviate from the expectations of the external shock model , which calls for a refined afterglow model .",
    "several scenarios have been proposed to explain these unexpected features .",
    "some authors invoke energy injection processes @xcite or forward shocks ( fs ) refreshed by late shells @xcite to produce the x - ray plateau .",
    "meanwhile , circum - burst density enhancements @xcite , two - component jets @xcite , or varying microphysical parameters @xcite have been invoked to explain the optical re - brightenings . however , recent studies indicate the density enhancements model may not work for significant re - brightenings @xcite .",
    "if one wants to interpret a large sample of afterglows , which model is preferred is still uncertain . although there are various candidate models for afterglows , the possible central engines of grbs are mainly limited in two kinds of objects .",
    "it is generally believed that the central engines of grbs should either be rapidly spinning , strongly magnetized neutron stars ( magnetar , @xcite ) or black holes @xcite .",
    "this indicates that there is probably a common origin for the optical re - brightenings and the simultaneous x - ray features of a group of afterglows .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to develop a model which , after taking into account the physics of the central engine , can explain the multi - wavelength afterglows simultaneously .    from the visual perspective ,",
    "the optical re - brightening seems to be a new component emerging when the flux from the fs gets dim . in the two - component jet model",
    ", this kind of late - time component naturally corresponds to a wide jet .",
    "however , it may have difficulties in explaining the chromatic evolution of the afterglows in some cases @xcite .",
    "the new component can also be generated in another model , i.e. , a long - lasting reverse shock ( rs ) can play the role .",
    "if the fs is re - energized by a late outflow ( e.g. , an electron - positron - pair wind , @xcite ) , then an rs will form behind the fs . as the rs propagating into the outflow , it would contribute to the emission , and its flux can even exceed that from the fs . moreover , the emission from the rs can help to make diverse light curves in principle since the microphysical parameters may differ from those of the fs .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to argue that some light curves with re - brightenings are due to the existence of a long - lasting rs . on the other hand ,",
    "the long - lasting rs should be common since it is a natural consequence of the energy injection .",
    "in previous studies , it has been proposed that continuous energy injections in the form of pure poynting - flux coming from the central engines may play a key role in explaining some special light curves , through its effects on the evolution of the fs @xcite . however , in such a scenario without an rs , the emission from the fs could not account for the new components of the re - brightenings discussed here .    in this paper , we propose the ultrarelativistic electron - positron - pair ( @xmath1 ) wind model to interpret the afterglows with special re - brightenings . after a grb",
    ", the remaining object of the progenitor may be a magnetar , which should lose its rotational energy by ejecting a continuous poynting - flux .",
    "we assume that the poynting - flux is converted into an ultrarelativistic @xmath1 wind beyond a particular radius ( @xmath2 cm ) .",
    "when the @xmath1 wind catches up with the fs , an rs will form and propagate back into the @xmath1 wind . the wind will be shocked and heated by the rs , and radiation from these @xmath1 can account for the optical re - brightenings at late time .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that this scenario was originally proposed by @xcite and then used to explain the x - ray plateau and bump by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , the method used to solve the shock dynamics in the current work is different and we aim to explain optical re - brightenings .",
    "the mechanism of converting the poynting - flux into ultrarelativistic @xmath1 wind is still unknown .",
    "previous researches indicate that magnetic dissipation may help to explain why pulsar wind nebulae are powered by particle - dominated winds @xcite .",
    "such a dissipation may also occur in millisecond magnetars .    in our study",
    ", we select as examples four grbs , of which high quality multi - wavelength observational data are available .",
    "they are all characterized by optical re - brightenings but without corresponding behaviors being detected in x - rays .",
    "we show that they can be well explained in our model .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly describe the dynamic methods used in our work and the formulae for calculating the radiation . in section 3 , we show how our scenario would work to explain the re - brightenings .",
    "the results for each grb are presented separately in section 4 .",
    "the conclusions are summarized in section 5 .",
    "when a relativistic outflow propagates into the circum - burst medium , an fs will form . if the central engine is long - lived and a continuous wind is ejected , an rs is expected to propagate back into the wind .",
    "the dynamics of such an fs - rs system can be numerically solved by considering energy conservation as proposed by @xcite , or through the mechanical consideration as done by beloborodov & uhm ( 2006 ; also see uhm 2011 ) . for clarity",
    ", these two methods are described separately in the appendixes a.1 and a.2 .",
    "now , we show that the dynamical results of these two methods are consistent with each other within our @xmath1 wind scenario .",
    "the poynting - flux luminosity @xmath3 of a newly born magnetar can be derived from the magnetic dipole radiation @xcite , i.e. , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the strength of the surface magnetic field of the magnetar , @xmath6 is the radius and @xmath7 is its spin period . @xmath8",
    "s is the spin - down timescale , where @xmath9 is the moment of inertia of the magnetar .",
    "the convention @xmath10 in cgs units is adopted hereafter .",
    "for simplicity , we fix @xmath11 , @xmath12  cm and @xmath13  ms throughout this work , then @xmath14 is mainly determined by only one parameter , i.e. , @xmath5 . we assume the poynting - flux is converted into an @xmath1 pair wind beyond @xmath15 cm , which is the typical deceleration radius of the outflow .",
    "the particle density in the comoving frame of the unshocked wind ( or called region 4 ) at the radius @xmath16 is then @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the mass of electron , @xmath19 is the speed of light and @xmath20 is the lorentz factor of the unshocked wind .",
    "note that the fs - rs system can be divided into four regions ( see appendix a.1 ) , the quantities of region `` @xmath21 '' are denoted by subscripts `` @xmath21 '' . in this paper , the superscript prime ( @xmath22 ) is used to denote the quantities in the shock comoving frame while characters without prime denote quantities in the observer frame .",
    "for an outflow with an isotropic kinetic energy of @xmath23 erg and an initial lorentz factor of @xmath24 , we set the number density of the ambient medium @xmath25 is 1  @xmath26 , @xmath20 is @xmath27 , and @xmath5 is @xmath28 g. then the evolution of the bulk lorentz factor of the fs ( @xmath29 ) and the rs ( @xmath30 ) can be obtained using the two methods mentioned above .",
    "figure 1 shows the results from the energy conservation method and the mechanical method .",
    "we see that the difference between the two solutions is tiny , which means they are consistent with each other .",
    "the two solutions approach the solution given by @xcite ( referred to as the bm solution below ) at late times , which is foreseeable since @xmath14 finally becomes very weak and the role of the rs is insignificant . in our following study",
    ", we will adopt the mechanical method to solve the dynamics of the fs - rs system .    to calculate the afterglow light curves of the fs - rs system",
    ", we consider both the synchrotron radiation and the inverse compton radiation from shock - accelerated electrons .",
    "detailed formulae are described in appendix b.",
    "in our study , we have collected the afterglow data of four grbs , i.e. , grb 080413b @xcite , grb 090426 @xcite , grb 091029 @xcite and grb 100814a @xcite .",
    "the observational data are of high quality , and all the four events show clear optical re - brightenings at @xmath0 s. the rising of the re - brightenings is generally smooth and shallow , contrary to many other grbs which brightens sharply @xcite .",
    "this indicates the re - brightening component is a result of a continuous behavior , which can be well achieved in our model .",
    "a brief summary of the observations of these grbs is presented in table 1 .",
    "we will interpret these afterglows by using our model and discuss the underlying relation between the afterglow behavior and the central engine .    our sample of afterglows",
    "are characterized by a double - bump structure . for the early onset bump ( it may not show up due to the lack of early observations ) , we suggest that it is connected with the typical synchrotron frequency crossing the optical band , or the fs being in the coasting phase",
    ". the second re - brightening bump could be due to the emerging rs component at about @xmath31 .",
    "we take grb 100814a as an example to show how this double - bump structure can be consistently reproduced in our model and how the physical parameters can be estimated from analytical derivations .",
    "below , we use the convention @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the flux density of region @xmath21 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the power - law indices .",
    "the first bump appearing in the optical afterglows of grb 100814a is roughly at @xmath36 s and the rising temporal index is @xmath37 . in the framework of the external shock model",
    ", it indicates that the fs is in the coasting phase @xcite .",
    "we assume the isotropic kinetic energy of the outflow is @xmath38 , then the initial lorentz factor @xmath39 can be calculated as @xmath40^{1/8}$ ] .",
    "assuming @xmath38 equals the energy released in the prompt phase ( @xmath41 erg ) and using typical value of @xmath42 @xmath26 , we obtain @xmath43 . at the end of the coasting phase ,",
    "@xmath44 should have crossed the optical band since the observed optical flux decreases after @xmath45 .",
    "this requires @xmath46 hz , i.e. , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the redshift of the grb , @xmath49 is the power - law index of the distribution of electrons in region @xmath21 , @xmath50 is the fraction of the total energy carried by the electrons , and @xmath51 is the ratio of the magnetic field energy to the total energy .    after the coasting phase , we assume the evolution of @xmath29 obeys @xmath52 . according to section 2 , we can still use the bm solution , i.e. , @xmath53^{1/2}$ ] , and @xmath54 .",
    "then the typical synchrotron frequency of region 2 is given by @xmath55 and the peak flux density at @xmath56 ( luminosity distance ) is @xmath57 for region 3 , @xmath14 can be taken as a constant within @xmath31 , and the relative lorentz factor @xmath58 , then the typical synchrotron frequency is given by @xmath59 the cooling frequency is @xmath60 and the peak flux density is @xmath61 according to equations ( 6 - 7 ) , the condition of @xmath62 is usually valid within @xmath63 s.    after the first peak , the optical afterglow enters the slow decay phase , during which the temporal index is @xmath64 . on the other hand , @xmath65",
    "is predicted as @xmath66 when @xmath67 , which gives @xmath68 .    just before the emergence of the rs component ( i.e. , @xmath69 ) , @xmath70 should equal @xmath69 at a certain time .",
    "we denote this time as @xmath71 .",
    "for the regime @xmath72 , we have @xmath73 .",
    "the @xmath74 band data shows @xmath75 s , and the flux density at @xmath71 is @xmath76 mjy .",
    "therefore we can get @xmath77 mjy , which further gives @xmath78 and @xmath79 where @xmath80 hz .",
    "the flux from the rs should reach its peak at @xmath31 since the flux decays when @xmath81 ( see below ) . in principle",
    "we can set @xmath31 as the peak time of the second bump , e.g , @xmath82 .",
    "however , the effect of the equal arrival time surface ( eats ) would delay the peak time in the optical bands . on the other side",
    ", the peak time in x - rays will be less affected . in the case of grb 100814a",
    ", we notice that there may be a small structure in the x - ray afterglow at @xmath83 s , which gives @xmath84 s. we take @xmath11 , @xmath12  cm and @xmath13  ms as typical values , then @xmath5 can be constrained from @xmath31 , and @xmath14 can be obtained from equation ( 1 )",
    ".    when @xmath85 , @xmath14 can not be treated as constant since @xmath86 is approaching @xmath31 . in this case , we have @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 . a power - law fitting to this segment",
    "gives the observed temporal index as @xmath90 .",
    "if we assume the evolution of @xmath14 during this segment is roughly @xmath91 , then @xmath92 can be inferred to be 2.4 .",
    "after the second peak ( @xmath93 ) , since @xmath14 evolves as @xmath94 , @xmath95 will decay with time and @xmath96 will increase . as a result",
    ", none of them will cross the optical band , i.e. @xmath97 . the optical spectral index at this time becomes @xmath98 , which further gives @xmath99 since @xmath100 .",
    "this value is consistent with that obtained before .",
    "the jet break time @xmath101 is hard to determine since the fs flux is always lower than that of the rs component after @xmath71 . in our fitting , we assume @xmath102 s , which requires the half - opening angle of the jet @xmath103 rad @xcite .",
    "we have little knowledge on the bulk lorentz factor of the @xmath1 wind , @xmath20 .",
    "however , a value ranging from @xmath27 to @xmath104 may be reasonable @xcite .",
    "for grb 100814a , we take @xmath105 .",
    "there are still four free parameters left , i.e. , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 . using conditions given in equations ( 3 ) , ( 9 - 10 ) , and an underlying relation @xmath110",
    ", we get @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 . in our subsequent study",
    ", we use these parameter values as a guide to perform numerical calculations , adjusting the parameters slightly to get a visually good agreement to the observed afterglow light curves ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "the final values ( see in table 2 ) of the parameters do not deviate significantly from the above derivations .",
    "the high - energy @xmath114-ray afterglow of grb 100814a is also calculated .",
    "figure 3 presents the flux density at 100 mev , in which the ssc flux from the rs leads to a small bump in the light curve at @xmath63 s. this is a special feature predicted by our model .",
    "high - energy observations in the future can help to test the prediction .",
    "we apply the above procedure to the afterglows of other three grbs ( see figures 4 - 6 ) .",
    "the derived parameters are also listed in table 2 .    in order to provide a meaningful constraint on the parameters , we make use of the data fitting code named emcee @xcite , which is a widely used tool based on the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) simulations",
    ". there are totally 11 parameters for each grb",
    ". it would be difficult to solve the problem if we set all these parameters as free parameters .",
    "the degeneracy between the parameters is one major reason .",
    "even for 7 parameters related to the fs , this degeneracy may be significant @xcite .",
    "the other reason is the incredible computational cost in the mcmc sampling .",
    "since we are mostly interested in the parameters connected with the rs , we finally chose @xmath5 , @xmath20 and @xmath109 as free parameters .",
    "the allowed ranges of these parameters in the monte carlo simulation is set to be [ 0.1,100]@xmath115 g , [ 0.1,100 ] and [ @xmath116,0.9 ] respectively .",
    "other parameters are fixed by using the values of table 2 .",
    "the simulation results are presented in table 3 .",
    "figure 7 shows the corner plot of the fit for grb 080413b as an example , which consists of the marginalized distributions of each parameter and the covariances between pairs of parameters .",
    "the sensitivity of the results ( in table 3 ) on fixing other parameters can be roughly analysed .",
    "in order to approach a good fitting to a specific light curve with re - brightening , the early afterglow is attributed to the fs and the re - brightening is attributed to the rs . in the case of small @xmath5 (",
    "the re - brightening occurs relatively late ) , the dynamics of the fs is slightly affected by the @xmath1 wind .",
    "that would make some fs parameters independent of the rs parameters .",
    "taking grb 080413b as an example , the early peak of the afterglow indicates @xmath44 should be crossing the optical band at @xmath117 s ( figure 4 ) .",
    "if one applies the mcmc fitting with the fs parameters , according to equations ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) , one would find @xmath107 and @xmath38 are degenerate in some extent , and they are in negative correlation with @xmath106 or @xmath25 ( also see figure 1 in @xcite ) . on the other hand , according to equation ( 10 ) , @xmath38 and @xmath25 would be involved in calculations of the flux from the rs .",
    "both of them are expected to be negatively correlated with @xmath20 in the corner plot . to judge",
    "whether the results in table 3 are meaningful , we can do the following experiment .",
    "now , we fix the parameters in table 3 , and leave parameters @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath25 free . the mcmc fitting ( see figure 8) gives @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 respectively .",
    "these values do not deviate much from those in table 2 . in figure 8",
    ", we can see @xmath25 is well constrained , which implies the results in table 3 are sensitive to @xmath25 .",
    "this could be understandable since @xmath25 is involved in the calculation of the dynamics of the rs and other parameters of the rs are fixed now .",
    "this feature implies that the results in table 3 would become robust when the early observational data ( mainly related with the fs ) could constrain parameters @xmath38 and @xmath25 well .",
    "the four grbs studied here actually have been investigated by other authors in the literature .",
    "previous efforts failed to explain many of the puzzling behaviors of these events . here",
    ", we would like to discuss how our mechanism can improve the modeling .",
    "the afterglow of grb 080413b has been explained by the on - axis two - component jet model @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the narrow ultra - relativistic jet is responsible for the initial decay , while the moderately relativistic wide jet is expected to account for the late re - brightening .",
    "the collapsar model of long - duration grbs offers a possible mechanism for generating a two - component jet @xcite . according to @xcite ,",
    "the power - law index of the narrow jet electrons can be derived as @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) from the observed optical temporal index of @xmath123 .",
    "however , such an electron distribution with @xmath124 significantly less than 2 seems to be too hard .",
    "simulation on fermi acceleration of charged particles by relativistic shocks indicates @xmath124 is @xmath125 in the ultrarelativistic limit @xmath126 @xcite .",
    "the investigation on the distribution of @xmath124 from _ swift _ grb afterglows supports a gaussian distribution centered at @xmath127 with a width of 0.59 @xcite .    in our model",
    ", this difficulty no longer exists .",
    "the evolution of the lorentz factor of fs before @xmath31 deviates from the bm solution ( @xmath128 ) due to the effect of the @xmath1 wind , i.e. , @xmath74 should be @xmath129 . using the closure relation of @xmath130 , we can obtain @xmath131 if @xmath132 .",
    "thus we can fit the light curves with a reasonable @xmath124 .",
    "additionally , in the two - component jet model , the optical spectral index ( pre - jet break ) of @xmath133 indicates @xmath134 ( @xmath135 ) for the wide jet . in our model",
    ", @xmath136 is greater than @xmath137 but slightly smaller than @xmath138 , which gives @xmath139 ( see in table 2 ) .",
    "this value again is more acceptable .",
    "grb 090426 is a short grb according to its duration ( nicuesa guelbenzu et al .",
    "however , some authors argued that grb 090426 may be connected with a collapsar event , rather than the merger of two compact objects @xcite . in this case , a magnetar could be naturally involved .",
    "the high density of @xmath140 @xmath26 derived from our fitting is consistent with the lower limit of 10 @xmath26 given by @xcite .",
    "the optical and x - ray light curves of grb 090426 could be fitted by the two - component jet model of @xcite .",
    "but we notice that the first break ( around 300 s ) in the @xmath141 band light curve can not be explained by the jet break of the narrow - jet component @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "it can be reasonably explained as the cessation of the energy injection episode @xcite .",
    "this is a natural consequence of our model .",
    "we have shown that the dynamics of the fs is significantly affected by the @xmath1 wind at early times , but it should be in accord with the bm solution at late stages . in figure 5 , we can see that this break corresponds to the turn over of the evolution of @xmath142 . according to @xcite , the steep decay of the optical afterglow after",
    "@xmath143 s is due to the sideways expansion of the wide jet .",
    "however , the sideways expansion of a relativistic jet may be a very slow process @xcite , which disfavors the short interval between the peak time ( @xmath144 s ) and the jet break time in grb 090426 . in our scenario , this steep decay is a natural result of the quick decline of @xmath14 after the spin - down timescale .",
    "the optical and x - ray light curves of the afterglow of grb 091029 are not similar to each other and are hard to be explained by a simple model .",
    "it is very peculiar that the optical spectral index decreases between 0.4 ks and 9 ks , and increases later , but at the same time , the x - ray spectral index is almost a constant .",
    "@xcite examined several scenarios and argued that a two - component jet can basically explain the observations .",
    "the hardening of the optical spectrum can be explained by assuming that the electron power - law index changes with time . in our scenario ,",
    "the hardening of the optical spectrum before @xmath27 s is also due to the varying electron index @xmath124 of the fs @xcite .",
    "but after @xmath27 s , the softening of the optical spectrum is caused by the rising flux from the rs . according to @xcite ,",
    "the x - ray spectral index is @xmath145 over the entire time window . in our model ,",
    "the x - ray band is in the @xmath146 regime at @xmath147 s , which leads to @xmath148 .",
    "note that the optical flux from the rs should be dominated after @xmath27 s , @xmath92 should be relatively larger in order to match the softening spectrum . in our numerical calculations",
    ", we finally takes @xmath148 , @xmath149 .",
    "the broad - band afterglow of grb 091029 can be fitted quite well .",
    "possible interpretations for the afterglow of grb 100814a have been discussed by @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", the optical re - brightenings are attributed to the fs , when @xmath150 of the fs is crossing the optical band , and the rs is generated by the late shells that collide with the trailing ones . in our scenario , the re - brightening is due to the emerging of the rs flux , while the rs forms due to the injection of continuous @xmath1 winds .",
    "our numerical results indicate that the optical flux from the fs peaks at around 400 s , when @xmath150 of the fs crosses the optical band ( see the lower panel of figure 2 ) . the observed @xmath151 band light curve ( see figure 2 of de pasquale et al .",
    "2015 ) does show an early peak , which is consistent with our results .",
    "optical re - brightenings appearing at @xmath144 s in the afterglows of some grbs may come from a common origin . in this work , we attribute the re - brightenings to the rs propagating into the ultrarelativistic @xmath1 wind ejected by the central engine .",
    "we compared two methods used for solving the dynamics and found that they are both appropriate in describing the fs - rs system .",
    "multi - wavelength afterglows of four grbs can be well explained in the framework of our scenario .",
    "the success of our model can give helpful information on the central engine of these grbs .",
    "@xmath31 can be derived from the x - ray peak time of the rs component as described in section 3 , which could give clues on the characteristics of the newly born magnetar .",
    "generally , an earlier re - brightening means @xmath5 is larger or @xmath7 is smaller , i.e. , the magnetar losses its energy more quickly . in the future , if the observational data can help to constrain the parameters of the fs well enough , we will be able to derive @xmath5 more accurately by using the re - brightening .",
    "it will be a useful way to probe the characteristics of the magnetar .",
    "note that the derived values of @xmath20 of grb 091029 and grb 100814a are larger than those of the other two grbs .",
    "it means that the efficiency of converting the poynting - flux to the kinetic energy of particles is higher in these cases .",
    "observationally , it seems there are no equivalent features in x - rays around the optical re - brightenings .",
    "however , the predicted emission near @xmath152 in both optical and x - ray wavelengths is dominated by the rs component in our model .",
    "there are two main factors to result in this puzzle .",
    "first , the actual peak time of the rs component in optical bands is delayed ( @xmath153 ) by the eats effect , which causes the flux ratio @xmath154 to be relatively larger since @xmath155 is decreasing .",
    "second , at the x - ray peak time , the flux ratio of @xmath156 is expected to be relatively small . moreover ,",
    "the emerging of the rs component in x - rays is essential to produce the x - ray plateau , otherwise the x - ray light curve will decay as a power - law after @xmath157 ( see @xmath70 in figure 2 ) . in other words",
    ", the x - ray plateau should be a common feature accompanying the optical re - brightening .",
    "the fact that the re - brightening time is coincident with @xmath31 , together with the arguments that magnetars could serve as the central engines of grbs in recent years , motivates us to suggest that there may be a common origin for the re - brightening .",
    "@xmath1 winds are natural outcome from magnetars , as hinted from phenomena associated with pulsar wind nebulae .",
    "thus we believe our scenario could work well and it is physically reasonable .",
    "of course , the models involving late shells with a range of velocities may also produce the similar results .",
    "further study on the form of the injected energy are thus called to give a conclusion . in principle",
    ", the mass density is different between a baryonic shell and an electron - positron wind .",
    "but it is not clear how the mass density can be measured from observations .",
    "for the baryonic shell , one may calculate the total mass of the shell to check whether it is reasonable .    in the future , two potential ways should help to discriminate between our @xmath1 winds model and models involving baryons - dominated shells .",
    "first , the high energy emission ( @xmath158 100 mev ) should be more significant when the continuously injected energy is carried by leptons rather than baryons , since ic scattering will be much stronger @xcite .",
    "as an example , fig .",
    "3 shows that the ssc flux from the rs exceeds the synchrotron emission from the fs at late times in the case of grb 100814a .",
    "if a high energy bump is observed near the peak time of the optical re - brightening , it will be a strong evidence for the @xmath1 wind .",
    "furthermore , the evolution of the polarization degree during the plateau or the re - brightening phase in two models are significantly different @xcite .",
    "therefore , the observations on the high energy emission and the polarization during the re - brightening phase would identify which model is preferred .",
    "the @xmath1 wind scenario is not necessarily based on magnetars as central engines . a newly born bh accompanied by an accretion disk",
    "may also emit continuous poynting - flux @xcite and the luminosity evolution may somehow be similar to that of a megnetar ( equation 1 ) .",
    "such a bh can also serve as the central engine in our model . in our model",
    ", the poynting - flux is assumed to be converted to an @xmath1 wind efficiently , but note that the possibility of this conversion and its efficiency are still quite uncertain for a newly born magnetar .",
    "a more general treatment is to introduce a magnetization parameter @xmath159 to describe the late ejecta @xcite , and this may affect the rs emission if @xmath159 is significantly larger than 1 . the diversity of @xmath159 would also help to explain why optical re - brightenings do not appear in some grb afterglows . for a magnetized ejecta , the parameters derived may be correspondingly different .",
