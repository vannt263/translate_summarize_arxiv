    "it is a remarkable fact that the entropy of a black hole can be understood in terms of the surface area of its horizon @xcite .",
    "why is there such a connection between the size of the hole and its entropy ? in this paper",
    "we make a small observation that might be relevant to this connection .",
    "let us consider extremal holes , using string theory .",
    "consider first the 3-charge system , which can be made with charges d1-d5-p wrapped on the cycles of a compactification @xmath0 @xcite . at weak coupling @xmath1 we can count the microstates that have charges @xmath2 , getting an entropy @xmath3 .",
    "next , follow the system towards larger coupling @xmath4 .",
    "now we can say that these charges should describe an extremal black hole in 4 + 1 noncompact dimensions . a classical black hole of this type has an infinitely deep throat , ending in a horizon whose area gives @xmath5 ( fig.[first](a ) ) .",
    "but because the throat is infinitely deep , the system has no energy gap ; we can place a wavepacket in the throat as deep as we want , which means that we can get as much of a redshift as we want .",
    "this sounds strange , since we are still dealing with a finite sized system made of a finite number of charges , so we would have expected that the energy gap to be small but nonzero .        in @xcite it was argued that as we increase @xmath4 from zero , the ` size ' of the brane bound state increases as well , such that at all values of @xmath4 the size of the state is of the same order as the horizon radius at that @xmath4 .",
    "the essential reason for this large size was the phenomenon of ` fractionation ' , which makes the brane bound state have a size that depends on the number of charges it contains , instead of being a fixed size like planck length or string length .",
    "the computation of @xcite was a very crude estimate .",
    "but in @xcite it was noted that one can start with the 2-charge system , which gives the simplest model of a black hole . in this case",
    "all states can be understood explicitly in the cft and in gravity , and the 2-charge bound states were found to be ` horizon sized fuzzballs ' .",
    "next , we find that we can take very special states of the d1-d5-p system where many quanta are chosen to lie in the same mode .",
    "this makes the state ` classical ' , and we can construct the geometry for these states .",
    "one finds the situation in fig.[first](b ) , where the throat ends in a smooth cap rather than a horizon @xcite .",
    "the energy gap is now finite , and is found to agree exactly with the gap in the dual cft state .",
    "the generic state will not have all its quanta placed in a few modes , so we will not get a classical geometry ; rather the throat will end in a very quantum ` fuzzball ' ( fig.[first](c ) ) . instead of the precise energy ` gap ' mentioned above we can consider a closely related quantity : the depth of the throat up to the quantum region .",
    "an indirect argument shows that this depth again agrees with the corresponding quantity in the cft @xcite .",
    "large families of 3 charge geometries ( in 4 + 1 dimensions ) and 4 charge geometries ( in 3 + 1 dimensions ) have now been constructed @xcite .",
    "these all have the same charges and mass as the extremal black hole , but no horizon ; the throat is ` capped ' in each case .",
    "if the picture fig.[first](c ) is a correct description of the hole , then black holes are not that different from other quantum systems ; they are large quantum balls with information distributed throughout a horizon sized region .",
    "what basic physics governs the size of these objects ?",
    "a principal feature of black holes is their large entropy .",
    "but entropy is just the log of the volume of phase space occupied by the allowed states of the system .",
    "if this phase space is large , perhaps it is not possible to make the system too small in size , and this may be the reason that the generic state becomes a horizon sized ` fuzzball ' .",
    "we will explore this notion with the help of a small calculation .",
    "consider the 2-charge system , where we compactify iib string theory on @xmath6 .",
    "we wrap an ns1 string @xmath7 times along @xmath8 , and add @xmath9 units of momentum along @xmath8 .",
    "the entropy is large since it grows with the charges s_micro=2 [ en1 ] now let us picture the states contributing to this entropy . the ns1 is a ` multiwound string ' wound @xmath7 times around the @xmath8 before joining back to itself . in fig.[intro](a ) , at the top , we have drawn this string opened up to its full length , ( i.e. , we have taken the @xmath7-fold cover of the @xmath8 ) .",
    "the momentum is carried by transverse vibrations of the ns1 , and fig.[intro](a ) depicts a ` generic state ' contributing to the entropy ( [ en1 ] ) , with its corresponding transverse amplitude . below this string",
    "we sketch the trajectory taken by the ns1 in the noncompact directions ; we see that the transverse vibrations of the string cause it to spread over a ball in the these noncompact directions . below this ball",
    "we sketch the geometry produced by the string state .",
    "it is flat space at infinity , then a throat narrowing towards the location of the string , but this throat does not reach down to a pointlike singularity .",
    "instead , the throat ` caps off ' when we reach down to the boundary of the ball .",
    "we have taken a classical profile for the ns1 , but if we include quantum fluctuations , then the region inside this boundary gives the ` fuzzball ' region .",
    "it was observed in @xcite that the area of the boundary of this ball satisfies ~~s_micro [ rel ] thus the actual microstates of the system have no horizon , but the boundary of the region where microstates differ from each other satisfies a bekenstein type relation with the entropy inside the boundary .",
    "can this be an instance of a more general principle ?",
    "in @xcite the rotating 2-charge system was also considered ; here the microscopic entropy is @xmath10 , and boundary area of the fuzzy region around the ring again satisfied the analogue of ( [ rel ] ) .    to explore further this relation between boundary area and enclosed entropy , we proceed as follows .",
    "we again consider the ns1-p system , but restrict our states to a ` sub - ensemble ' , which we now describe .",
    "the total momentum carried on the string is fixed by the momentum charge that we have chosen .",
    "but we can have states where the momentum is in high wavenumbers with small transverse amplitude , or in low wavenumbers with large transverse amplitude .",
    "the entropy is optimised for some typical wavenumber and its corresponding amplitude , and such a typical state has been depicted in fig.[intro](a ) . but",
    "now let us restrict to the subset of states which have a wavenumber higher than this optimal value ; the amplitude of transverse vibration will then be smaller than the amplitude in the generic state ( fig.[intro](b ) ) .",
    "the microscopic entropy of states restricted to this smaller amplitude is smaller than ( [ en1 ] ) by a factor which we call @xmath11 . in the spacetime description",
    ", the ns1 now lives inside a smaller ` ball ' , and the spacetime geometry has a throat which becomes narrower and deeper before capping off .",
    "we compute the boundary of the fuzzball region in this case , and ask if , to leading order , it has also decreased by a factor @xmath11 . we find that such is indeed the case .",
    "we repeat the computation for the case with rotation , and find a similar agreement .",
    "this is the main computation of this paper .",
    "the sub - ensembles with smaller entropy had their fuzzball boundaries at deeper points in the throat , where the transverse area was smaller .",
    "we observe that we can recast this computation in a form where we hold the location of the boundary fixed but reduce the _ distortion _",
    "@xmath12 allowed in the metric at the boundary . allowing a smaller distortion forces the throat to continue to be the ` naive ' one to deeper depths , and thus leads to the sub - ensemble with small entropy .",
    "we suggest a relation between the ` capped ' nature of throats and an old puzzle with extremal holes : in a euclidean gravity computation one finds that the entropy of an extremal hole is _ zero _ @xcite .",
    "the euclidean computation uses an infinitely long uniform throat , which does not correspond to a state in the fuzzball picture .",
    "string theory counts actual microstates , and these all ` cap off ' before reaching the end of the infinite throat .",
    "finally , we check that quantum corrections will not change our conclusions . to this end",
    "we list the sources of quantum effects , and examine their roles . in the process",
    "we compute various length and curvature scales to obtain a picture of the generic 2-charge extremal state for our @xmath6 compactification .",
    "we end with some conjectures on how phase space effects may help resolve puzzles associated with black holes .",
    "let us recall the basic structure of the 2-charge extremal system .",
    "the results summarized below can be found in more detail in the review @xcite .      take type iib string theory , with the compactification m_9,1m_4,1_4s^1",
    "the 4-manifold @xmath13 can be @xmath14 or k3 ; we will let it be @xmath14 for now .",
    "let this @xmath14 have volume @xmath15 , and let the @xmath8 have length @xmath16 .",
    "the string coupling is @xmath17 , and we will set @xmath18 .    now consider the bound state made with charges ns1-p , where the ns1 charge corresponds to an elementary string wound @xmath7 times on @xmath8 , and the p charge is @xmath9 units of momentum along @xmath8 .",

    "the p charge on the ns1 is carried by transverse vibrations of the ns1 .",
    "we will focus on the vibrations in the noncompact directions @xmath21 as these will give us an estimate for transverse size of the bound state .",

    "these vibrations are described by a ` profile function ' @xmath22 .",
    "the ns1 string , in the bound state , is a single ` multiwound ' string of total length l_t=2r n_1 [ tlength ] the vibration profile is a function of @xmath23 . there are four components of this displacement , @xmath24 , collected into the vector @xmath25 . thus the noncompact vibrations are described by @xmath22 with @xmath26 ranging over @xmath27 .",

    "we have kept the metric to be unity at infinity in the string frame .",

    "writing @xmath37 we see that ( [ naived ] ) is the ` naive ' metric that is conventionally written for the d1-d5 system : it is flat space at infinity , it has a ` throat ' for @xmath38 , ending in a singularity at @xmath39 .",
    "the geometry of the throat is the poincare patch of @xmath40 ( with a periodic identification @xmath41 ) . in",

    "while the geometries ( [ qsix ] ) have been generated by starting with a classical profile @xmath22 for the ns1 string , the actual state of the system will correspond to a quantum state of the string and will be a ` fuzzball ' .",
    "we will discuss the various sources of quantum effects in section [ nature ] below , but for now we are just interested in the location of the ` boundary ' of this fuzzball ; i.e. the surface inside which the typical state begins to differ from the naive geometry ( [ naived ] ) . in @xcite",
    "it was observed that the area of this boundary obeyed ~~s_micro in this section we review this result ; more details can be found in @xcite . in the next section",
    "we will find that a similar result holds for the sub - ensembles that we consider .",
    "consider the ns1-p system .",
    "the large entropy of the system arises from the fact that the momentum p on the ns1 can be partitioned in many ways among different harmonics . since we are dealing with bps states",
    ", we can look at them at weak coupling and then follow them to strong coupling . at weak coupling",
    "we have a string in flat space carrying transverse vibrations .",
    "the total energy on the string is e = p = n_pr=2n_1n_pl_t [ tenergy ] each excitation of the fourier mode @xmath43 carries energy and momentum e_k = p_k=2kl_t let there be @xmath44 excitations of type @xmath45 in the harmonic @xmath43 ( the index @xmath45 runs over 8 bosonic excitations and 8 fermionic excitations . )",
    "then we must have _ i _ k k m^i_k  =   n_1n_p [ equationm ] we assign each bps state the same probability , since it has the same charges and mass ( later we will add an additional weighting with angular momentum ) .",
    "the probability distribution is then a thermal one , describing left moving massless quanta in a box of length @xmath46 , with temperature t=^-1 = [ 12 el_t c]^12=l_t [ temperature ] ( here the central charge @xmath47 describes the effective number of degrees of freedom of the massless gas ; the bosons contribute @xmath48 and the fermions @xmath49 . )",
    "the entropy is s_micro=2 [ entropy ] consider the bosonic excitations . since we will only be estimating quantities upto factors of order unity , we restrict to just one flavor of boson and ignore the index @xmath45 . for this boson",
    "the occupation number of the @xmath43th harmonic is = 11-e^-e_k=11-e^-k [ occupation ]      let us build up a rough picture of how energy is distributed among harmonics in the generic state . since we just have a thermal gas of excitations , the typical excitation quantum will have energy @xmath50 , which from ( [ temperature ] ) gives for the mean harmonic order |k~ [ bark ] from ( [ occupation ] ) we see that for modes with @xmath51 the occupation number is ~1 [ unity ] the number of harmonics that have @xmath51 is itself of order @xmath52 . for concreteness let us consider a range |k < k < 32|k [ range ] which has a width k~|k ~ the number of quanta in this range is n~k   m_k ~ [ nvalue ] with each quantum carrying energy @xmath53",
    "the total energy is e~_|k n~2l_t|k n~2l_t n_1n_p which agrees with ( [ tenergy ] ) .      consider fig.[intro](a ) . in the next subsection we will find the radius of the ball enclosing the curve traced out by the ns1 .",
    "but there are many subtleties in defining this ball .",
    "we will mention some of these here , and then specify how we will define the transverse size of the state .    in the top sketch of fig.[intro](a )",
    "we have shown the ns1 carrying transverse oscillations of some typical wavelength @xmath54 .",
    "if we had a fourier wave of one precise wavelength @xmath54 , then the transverse size would be @xmath55 .",
    "if we have a spread over fourier modes , and the typical wavenumber is @xmath56 , then in a typical oscillation the string will have a transverse displacement @xmath57 . the ball in fig.[intro](a ) is drawn with the assumption that the oscillations of the string keep the string going back and forth in a region with radius of this order , and we will use this picture to compute the ball size below .",
    "thus we are in a sense taking the ` smallest possible size ' allowed to the ball when the vibrations have mean wavenumber @xmath56 .",
    "but there are many other measures possible for the ` size ' of the state .",
    "for example , when there is a spread over @xmath43 we can compute many different ` averages ' , which weight low and high @xmath43 in different ways . in @xcite a different way of computing",
    "` size ' was used and a much larger radius for the ball was found .",
    "this does not conflict with the essential idea of fuzzballs , since if the ball size is bigger than horizon size the information can not be trapped inside a horizon .",
    "but we would like to see which way of measuring size gives a relation to the area of the boundary , and as found in @xcite the definition we will use gives a direct relation to the idea of area entropy .    to see how other definitions of size might be related to the one we will choose ,",
    "consider again the string in fig.[intro](a ) . during each wavelength of oscillation",
    "the transverse displacement is @xmath58 .",
    "suppose we say that the path of the string in the noncompact directions is a random walk , with step size @xmath58 .",
    "then we will get a much larger ` ball size ' than @xmath58 , since the random walk has @xmath59 steps and will drift over a large transverse distance .",
    "but if we fourier transform this path , we will see that this large drift corresponds to low harmonics on the string , i.e. , modes with @xmath60 .",
    "in @xcite it was noted that the ` tail ' of low frequency modes in the distribution makes the entropy from the boundary area larger than the microscopic entropy by a logarithmic factor .",
    "we will filter out the effects on size that arise from the tail of low harmonics .",
    "but because of these uncertainities in defining the ensemble , _ we will ignore all log corrections below .",
    "_      recall that the total length of the ns1 string is @xmath46 given by ( [ tlength ] ) .",
    "thus for a mode in harmonic @xmath56 the wavelength of vibrations is = l_t|k~2r n_1~r [ wavelength ] we wish to ask how much the transverse coordinate @xmath35 changes in the process of oscillation .",
    "thus we set @xmath61 , and find |x|~||y~||r [ step1 ] from ( [ q1p ] ) we know that q_p ~q_1 ||^2 which gives | x|~r~1 [ ffone ] where we have used ( [ q1qp ] ) .",
    "we wish to compute the ` size ' of a generic fuzzball state .",
    "it turns out that it is easier to understand quantum corrections in the d1-d5 frame than in the ns1-p frame @xcite .",
    "thus we will work in the d1-d5 frame below . in this duality frame the ` spread ' ( [ ffone ] ) of the state in coordinate terms is r|x|=|x|~=g r [ bvalue ] where we have used ( [ mu ] ) .",
    "for |x||x| we have and the solution becomes approximately the naive geometry ( [ naived ] ) .",
    "we see that the metric settles down to the naive metric outside a certain ball shaped region @xmath62 .",
    "let us now ask the question : what is the surface area of this ball ? to compute this , we will take the naive metric ( [ naived ] ) , put a surface at @xmath63 , and find the area of this surface . since we will need a more general result in a moment ,",
    "let us set r=b and compute the area of the bounding surface in the naive geometry ( [ naived ] ) . in the bekenstein relation we can compute the area of the horizon surface in the 10-d einstein metric and divide by @xmath64 , or compute the area in the 5-d einstein metric and divide by @xmath65 = a_e^(5)g_n^(5 ) [ newton ] we will compute the area in 10-d , where we have an 8-dimensional surface : an @xmath8 from the direction @xmath66 , a @xmath14 from the directions @xmath67 , and an @xmath68 from the angular directions in @xmath69 .",

    "it was argued in @xcite that if a quantum falls into the region enclosed by this boundary , the complicated nature of the interior state traps the quantum for very long times , so that this boundary behaves like a ` horizon ' for observers that are observing the system only over classical timescales : i.e. times of order the radius of the @xmath68 .",
    "in this section we will perform the main computation of this paper .",
    "we wish to get some understanding of why the relation ( [ relation ] ) turned out to be true .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , black holes have a large entropy , and entropy is a measure of phase space volume .",
    "one might therefore conjecture that the ` fuzzball ' can not be too small because it needs to contain enough phase space to account for this large entropy .",
    "note that the area @xmath74 in ( [ relation ] ) is ` large ' in terms of the elementary scales in the theory . for the d1-d5 system ,",
    "the dilaton approaches a constant down the ` throat ' of the geometry , so string length @xmath75 and the 10-d planck length @xmath76 are of the same order everywhere . in other words , the ratio @xmath77 does not depend on the charges , which we will take to satisfy @xmath78 . since ( [ relation ] ) says that the horizon area in planck units gives the entropy @xmath79 , we see the 10-d horizon area is much larger than planck or string scale . from ( [ newton ] ) we see that the horizon area is large in terms of the 5-d planck scale as well .",
    "how do we explore the role of phase space in determining the size of the fuzzball ? as explained in the introduction , we will take a subset of states  which we call a ` sub - ensemble '  which contains states with transverse spread smaller than the spread of the generic state .",
    "we can compute the area of the bounding surface for the typical state of this sub - ensemble ; this will be smaller than the area @xmath74 in ( [ relation ] ) by some factor @xmath80 ( with @xmath81 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the entropy of such states will also be smaller than @xmath3 by some factor , and we wish to check if this factor is also @xmath80 .",
    "we will find that the factors indeed agree ( up to log terms that we will ignore ) . in the next section",
    "we will repeat the analysis for the 2-charge extremal ` black ring ' , which is the same 2-charge system but with rotation .",
    "we will again find a similar agreement .",
    "let us discuss the microscopic description first .",
    "as mentioned above , we will be working with the d1-d5 duality frame later , so we will make the replacement n_1   n_5 ,  n_p   n_1 in all relations which had been developed in the ns1-p duality frame .",
    "consider the entropy ( [ entropy ] ) .",
    "we want to get a crude argument for why this entropy is order @xmath82 in the charges . from ( [ bark ] ) we see that the generic quantum is in harmonic @xmath83 , and from ( [ nvalue ] ) we note that there are @xmath84 such quanta . from ( [ unity ] )",
    "we have that @xmath85 for these modes @xmath43 .",
    "let us thus take the crude approximation that this occupation number can be @xmath86 or @xmath87 for each mode in the range ( [ range ] ) , with equal probability .",
    "the number of possibilities is of order ~2^ so that the entropy is s_micro ~ we could certainly make a much better estimate if we wished ; for example we can take into account the fact that each mode has several polarization states , or the fact that the occupation numbers are not just @xmath88 , or the fact that occupation probability is not uniform in the range ( [ range ] ) . but the above crude estimate is enough for our purposes , since we will extend it to the case that we now wish to cover .",
    "we are interested in looking at the subset of states where the typical harmonic order is not @xmath89 but rather |k_m~m [ knew ] for some @xmath90 . since the total energy is still ( [ tenergy ] ) the number of excitation with @xmath43 of this order will be n_m~m [ excitations ] as before , we interpret ( [ knew ] ) as saying that @xmath43 lies in a range m < k <",
    "32 m [ rangenew ] so that the range of @xmath43 has a width k_m ~m note however that this time the number of excitations @xmath91 in ( [ excitations ] ) is much less than the number of elements in the range ( [ rangenew ] ) ~1m^2 < < 1 [ less ] so our task is to count the number of ways that @xmath92 excitations can be distributed in the range @xmath93 .",
    "because of ( [ less ] ) , we see that the @xmath92 excitations will be sparsely distributed in the range @xmath93 , so we do not have to worry about more than one excitation falling on the same value of @xmath43",

    "we can not answer this question fully at this stage .",
    "but in the above sections we have tried to probe the relation between entropy and area more deeply , by looking at sub - ensembles of the full space of states .",
    "let us first summarize the physics that we have seen .",
    "consider the 2-charge system in fig.[twocharge ] . in [ twocharge](a ) , the dashed boundary is placed at the location of the generic ` cap ' .",
    "the size of the @xmath8 at the location of this boundary is estimated by setting @xmath125 ( eq . ( [ bvalue ] ) ) in the naive geometry ( [ naived ] ) .",
    "since this boundary captures the generic state , the entropy of allowed states inside this boundary is @xmath126 .",
    "fig.[twocharge](b ) depicts the situation with the sub - ensembles that we considered .",
    "the naive geometry goes upto a deeper point , where the @xmath8 is smaller , and the boundary of the region where the caps differ is therefore smaller than the area in fig.[twocharge](a ) by some factor @xmath11 .",
    "the number of ` caps ' that come after this depth of throat is smaller too , with an entropy @xmath127 .    in fig.[twocharge](c )",
    "we have let the geometry be the naive one upto a distance longer than the longest throat allowed for any microstate .",
    "the @xmath8 boundary is now even smaller , and with this value of the boundary parameters there are no ` capped ' states possible .        what physics is suggested by these observations ?",
    "the fuzzball conjecture says that black holes are just large quantum balls , not fundamentally different from any other quantum system .",
    "thus different microstates of the fuzzball must be orthogonal wavefunctions of the system .",
    "one can imagine that it is not easy to fit too many orthogonal wavefunctions in a given region ( with a given energy ) .",
    "the number of orthogonal states reflects the phase space volume occupied by the ensemble .",
    "it is plausible that a large phase space volume implies , for the stationary states of our system , a large size in ordinary space @xmath35 . in that case",
    "the large size of fuzzballs would be the result of the large phase space of states they describe .",
    "but if this reasoning were correct , then we might expect a more general relation , which would say that _ any _ sub - ensemble of states with entropy @xmath3 would have to have a boundary area that satisfied @xmath128 .",
    "this is what we found for our sub - ensembles ; in fact they happened to be ` optimally packed ' sets of states , since they achieved the maximal entropy allowed for their boundary area .",
    "it would be interesting to check how these ideas work for 3-charge and 4-charge systems . at present",
    "it is not clear to us how sub - ensembles should be made for this case .",
    "suppose we take the sub - ensemble in fig.[twocharge](b ) but place the boundary at the same location as the boundary in fig.[twocharge](a ) ( shown by the upper ring in [ twocharge](b ) ) .",
    "what will we see at this boundary ?",
    "for the states in the full ensemble in fig.[twocharge](a ) , the geometry at the boundary @xmath129 is distorted by order unity compared to the naive geometry , since the caps start to differ significantly from each other at this point .",
    "for the states in the sub - ensemble of fig.[twocharge](b ) , there is very little distortion at this location ; the distortions will come much further down the throat at @xmath130 .",
    "if we place the boundary at @xmath129 in the geometry of fig.[twocharge](c ) then we will see virtually _ no _ distortion .",
    "thus we see that there are two geometric quantities that we can consider at a boundary .",
    "one is the area @xmath99 of this boundary .",
    "the other is the width @xmath12 of distortions that we allow at this boundary .",
    "we can now describe the ensembles in fig.[twocharge](a),(b),(c ) in two equivalent ways . in the first",
    ", we place the boundary at the location where the distortions become order unity , and then use the area @xmath99 at this boundary to differentiate between the ensembles . in the second we keep the boundary at any fixed location , say @xmath129 , and change the allowed width @xmath12 . for the case in fig.[twocharge ] ( a ) we will have a width of order unity , in [ twocharge](b ) the width would be smaller , and in [ twocharge](c ) it would be virtually zero .    as we will see in the next subsection , the second way of defining sub - ensembles may be related to other approaches to entropy like the use of asymptotic symmetries .",
    "the principal feature that we see in fuzzballs is that each microstate has a different structure after some distance down the throat .",
    "thus we see the ` hair ' responsible for the entropy of the system . with this explicit picture of the ` hair ' we might be able to understand better some other approaches to entropy :    \\(i ) the distortions at the fuzzball boundary give an _ entanglement _ @xcite between the states inside the cap and the geometry just outside . in the fuzzball picture ,",
    "the latter geometry is not the featureless naive geometry outside a horizon , but reflects the distortions of the ` cap ' .",
    "if we allow virtually no distortions , as in fig.[first](a ) , we get no states .",
    "\\(ii ) there is evidence of _ holography _",
    "@xcite , since the entropy in the possible ` caps ' is controlled by the area @xmath99 and width @xmath12 of fluctuations at the _ boundary_. in a general statistical system there would be no reason for the boundary data to reflect the entropy in the interior .",
    "\\(iii ) it may be possible to relate the @xmath12 caused by the fuzzball caps to the algebra of diffeomorphisms studied in @xcite .",
    "the central charge and level of this algebra appear to give a count of states , but it has never been explicitly clear what is being counted .",
    "black hole entropy has also been derived as a noether charge for diffeomorphisms ( in the time direction ) @xcite , but again it is not clear what this charge is counting .",
    "the fuzzball caps naturally generate distortions , and holography suggests that all information of the cap is captured by the distortions at the boundary .",
    "thus any method of counting these distortions at the boundary should relate the entropy to the boundary properties .",
    "the entropy of schwarzscild holes is given by the area of their horizon .",
    "this is also true for holes with charge , but what about _ extremal _ holes , which have the maximum charge for their mass ?",
    "the extremal reissner - nordstrom hole also has a nonvanising horizon area @xmath99 , but it has been argued that its entropy should be _ zero _ @xcite . in this argument one",
    "notes that the extremal hole has an infinitely long throat and therefore a different topology from nonextremal holes . for nonextremal holes one must compactify the euclidean time direction @xmath131 with a given period @xmath132 to avoid a singularity at the horizon . for the extreme hole",
    "we find that we can compactify @xmath131 with _ any _ period ; since the horizon is infinitely far away we do not get a singularity from a ` wrong ' choice of period",
    ".    on the other hand string theory has considered these extremal holes from a microscopic viewpoint , and used an indirect argument ( going to weak coupling ) to count the states of the system .",
    "the entropy agrees exactly with the area entropy @xmath133 @xcite .",
    "so the question arises : can we find a way to reconcile these two results on the entropy of extremal holes ?",
    "we do not know how to construct all the capped geometries for the 3-charge system , but there are several pieces of evidence for the fact that the ` cap ' structure of 3-charge and 4-charge systems is analogous to that in the 2-charge case . in @xcite",
    "capped geometries were constructed for a special family of states , and the depth of the throat upto the cap gave an energy gap that exactly agrees with the gap in the cft .",
    "we can ` squeeze ' the 3-charge hole by compactifying a transverse direction ; this gives a 3-charge extremal system in 3 + 1 noncompact dimensions .",
    "this system is completely analogous to the 2-charge system in 4 + 1 dimensions ; the throat narrows down as we go to @xmath134 .",
    "an indirect argument in @xcite showed that for this system of 3-charges in 3 + 1 dimensions the throat depths for the generic state were consistent with the energy gaps in the cft .",
    "large families of capped geometries have been found in @xcite , and the maximal throat depth for systems with @xmath135 symmetry was related to the cft energy gap in @xcite .",
    "the metric the naive 3-charge geometry has the form ds^2=(1+qr^2)^-1 [ -dt^2+dy^2]+(1+qr^2)[dr^2+r^2d_3",
    "^ 2]+dy^2+dz_adz_a [ naive3 ] this naive geometry is pictured in fig.[first](a ) , while the fuzzball picture of ` caps ' is fig.[first](c ) .",
    "we now see a possible reconcilation between the two results mentioned above for the entropy of extremal holes .",
    "the classical calculation which obtains @xmath136 considers a completely uniform infinite throat , and indeed in the fuzzball picture there are no states at the end of the infinite throat .",
    "the string calculation , on the other hand , started with small coupling @xmath17 , where the string bound state was a small quantum object .",
    "as we increase @xmath17 , the geometry picks up a deeper and deeper throat , but at no point does the throat become strictly infinite . to catch the states that have the entropy @xmath3 we must stop at a large but finite distance down the throat , where the generic caps appear . for each string state",
    "the geometry at the dashed boundary of fig.[first](c ) has some distortion from spherical symmetry .",
    "if we insisit on complete spherical symmetry we get the infinite throat , but this does not correspond to any state in the fuzzball picture , in agreement with the classical result .",
    "we have looked at the ` size ' of the fuzzball for a sub - ensemble of states of the 2-charge system , and noted that its surface area satisfies a bekenstein type relation with respect to its entropy . at this point",
    "we should check that quantum corrections do not make our observation meaningless ; i.e. , we should look at the sources of corrections to the classical geometries that we have used and check that their effects do not modify the essential properties of our states .",
    "the generic state is of course not well described by a classical solution  it is a quantum ` fuzzball ' .",
    "there are two sources of quantum effects :    \\(a ) _ low occupation numbers @xmath137:_the classical solutions ( [ qsix ] ) were generated by starting with a classical profile @xmath22 of the string .",
    "fourier transforming the @xmath138 in @xmath26 we arrive at a discrete set of harmonics , each of which is quantized as a harmonic oscillator . , and since the states are bps it will also give us the count at strong coupling .",
    "for a direct computation of the phase space structure at strong coupling , see @xcite . ]",
    "consider the oscillator for a fourier mode @xmath43 .",
    "if the occupation number @xmath139 of this mode is @xmath140 , then we get the same essential physics whether we look at energy eigenstates @xmath141 or coherent states |>=e^-||^22e^a_k^|0 ,  ||^2= m but in the generic state the oscillators have occupation numbers @xmath142 ( eq.([unity ] ) ) .",
    "so coherent states are not a good approximation , and all we have is a collection of eigenstates with low occupaption numbers for a large number of different harmonics @xmath43 .",
    "it is not hard to see that the transverse _ size _ of the state depends on the mean harmonic number @xmath56 , while the _ fluctuations _ depend on the mean occupaption number per harmonic @xmath143 .",
    "so the generic state has fluctuations of order unity , but we can estimate its size by using a classical state where all the energy is placed in a one harmonic of order @xmath56 .",
    "\\(b ) _ string 1-loop corrections:_we can have stringy effects that correct the state .",
    "the leading terms of this kind give @xmath144 terms in the low energy effective action .",
    "in @xcite it was noted that this term arises at one - string - loop order where an ns1 winding around the @xmath8 propagates around the loop . for the case of @xmath145 k3 compactifications",
    "we get an effective @xmath146 term in the noncompact directions , and this becomes order unity near the boundary of our generic state .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that this term remains bounded even though the @xmath8 shrinks to zero size ; this happens because the @xmath8 is a contractible loop in the full ` capped ' geometry . in the case",
    "@xmath147 , we get just an @xmath144 term in the noncompact directions .",
    "as we will see , the ratio of this @xmath144 term to the leading @xmath148 term is small , and we can explore a large range of the parameter @xmath11 in defining our sub - ensemble without the @xmath144 corrections becoming significant at the boundary .      as noted in @xcite , the @xmath144 terms in the effective action relevant to our system arise from string 1-loop effects , where a ns1 winding around the @xmath66 circle propagates around the loop .",
    "let us write this term for iib string theory , in the string frame , in the 8 + 1 dimensional space obtained by reduction on the @xmath8 along @xmath66 .",

    "we observe that ~1n_1n_5",
    "< < 1 so the 1-loop terms do not give a significant correction at the boundary of the fuzzball region .    now let us look at the boundary of the sub - ensemble with mean harmonic order @xmath155 ( eq.([knew ] ) ) .",

    "thus we find ~m^2v^2g^2 1n_1n_5~m^21n_1n_5 where in the last step we have again ignored the moduli .",
    "we therefore see that in computing the area of the boundary of the cap region we can ignore the 1-loop effects as long as we take 1<<m<<(n_1n_5)^12 this allows a large range for @xmath11 , and thus allows us to consider a large set of sub - ensembles .    in principle",
    "this is what we needed to check ; if the @xmath144 corrections do not significantly affect the region at the boundary , then the area of this boundary has been correctly estimated .",

    "the path of the ns1 traces out a convoluted curve inside this ball , and we wish to understand some properties of this curve . for example , we would like to know the typical distance between one segment of this curve and the closest neighboring segment .",
    "we do this as follows .",
    "look at the top sketch in fig.[intro](a ) .",
    "we know that the generic state has wavenumber @xmath159 .",
    "thus there are @xmath160 oscillations of this curve on the string .",
    "each oscillation , roughly speaking , makes the string traverse once across the ball .",
    "we draw the 4-dimensional space @xmath69 in fig.[ball ] .",
    "let us make a 3-dimensional section through the center of this 4-d region",

    ", these intersections occur in a 3-dimensional area a_3~n^32 thus the density of intersection points in this plane is ~na_3~n^-12 and the typical proper distance between points on this plane will be d~1 ^ 13~n^16 [ dd ] thus we see that the strands of the curve do not come within planck or string distance of each other , but stay quite far from each other in generic configurations .",
    "\\(iv ) let us note the ` thickness ' of the curve traced out by the string .",
    "we are working in the d1-d5 frame .",
    "a shown in @xcite , each point on the curve is not a singularity but the center of a kk monopole .",
    "the curvature length scale of this monopole is set by the length of the fibred circle , which is the @xmath66 circle @xmath8 , and this has length @xmath162 ( eq .",
    "( [ ll ] ) ) .",
    "this is very small ( much less than planck length ) .",
    "this situation is not a surprise , since it is exactly what happens with any brane in string theory : there can be a high curvature in a planck region around the brane , and this is just included in the description of the brane .",
    "the kk monopole tube is dualizable ( locally ) to any other brane in string theory , and so we will leave a planck sized tube around our curve as a region where we will not trust the classical metric .",
    "\\(v ) now let us look at the harmonic functions @xmath163 that give the metric ( [ qsix ] ) .",
    "all these functions have a similar structure , so let us look at @xmath164 .",
    "first let us go close to a point on the curve @xmath22 , say at a point @xmath165 .",
    "near this point , the curve looks like a straight line ; let @xmath166 be the coordinate distance from this line in the coordinates @xmath69 that we have used on the noncompact space for the d1-d5 system . if we are sufficiently close to the curve @xmath22 then we can replace the curve by the line , and we find .",
    "but with our choice of moduli ( [ choice ] ) , we have @xmath167 , @xmath168 , @xmath169 , and from @xmath170 we know that @xmath171 .",

    "h_1~1 [ rho ] now consider a point , like point a in fig.[ball](a ) , which is _ not _ close to any point on the curve @xmath22 .",
    "there is a contribution to @xmath164 from segments of @xmath22 that are close to the point a , and a contribution from segments further away .",
    "the closer segments are fewer , but for them @xmath173 is larger ; the further segments are more numerous , but @xmath173 is smaller .",
    "which contribution is more important ?",
    "a simple estimate tells us that the ` far away ' contribution is larger , but note that it also changes smoothly with position , since it comes from strands that are far away from the point a. let us call it @xmath174 .",
    "the ` nearby ' contribution is smaller , but it fluctuates on the scale of the distance between neightbouring strands , which we have seen is @xmath175 .",
    "we call it @xmath176 .",
    "we find h_1&=&h_1^smooth+h_1^fluch_1^smooth&~ & nh_1^fluc&~&~n^13 ( to estimate @xmath174 we note that @xmath177 and @xmath178 in ( [ functionsqq ] ) . to estimate @xmath176",
    "we have noted that the _ coordinate _ distance @xmath166 from point a to the nearest strand is the proper distance ( [ dd ] ) divided by @xmath179 ; here the factor @xmath179 is the ratio between coordinate and proper distances in @xmath69 space .",
    "we then substituted this @xmath166 in ( [ rho ] ) . )    the function @xmath180 has the same behavior , and in @xmath118 we find that the smooth part cancels to zero ( since the orientation of the vector @xmath181 changes randomly along the curve @xmath22 ) while the fluctuating part has the same order as @xmath176 .",
    "since the functions @xmath163 appear as coefficients in the metric ( [ qsix ] ) , we find that the metric in the space @xmath69 ( schematically called @xmath17 ) itself has a smooth part and a fluctuating part g = g^smooth+g^fluc with h~n^-23 [ hhh ]    \\(vi ) finally , we use the length scales found above to examine the @xmath144 effects .",
    "the smooth part of the metric @xmath182 varies over a distance of the order of the radius @xmath179 of the ball .",
    "thus it gives a curvature @xmath183 .",
    "thus for @xmath152 we have ~n^-3n^-1~1n^2 < < 1 where we have used ( [ ll ] ) for @xmath184 . the fluctuating part varies on a smaller distance scale @xmath185 , but @xmath186 is also small .",
    "thus we get a curvature r^fluc_s~hd^2~n^-1 which again gives @xmath187 .    to summarize",
    ", we get the picture sketched in fig.[ball ] .",
    "all lengths are measured in units of planck length .",
    "we have a ball of diameter @xmath161 .",
    "in this balls a curve winds around ; the quantum ` thickness ' of this curve is unity .",

    "the @xmath144 corrections are small .",
    "the ordinary quantum fluctuations of type ( a ) are always present , and these will cause the curve to fluctuate , and be in a general quantum wavefunction .    0.7 truein . in the generic state",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=336 ]",
    "we have looked at some subsets of states of the 2-charge extremal system , and found that in each case the boundary of the ` fuzzball ' satisfies a bekenstein type relation with the entropy inside the ball .",
    "this suggests that the system requires a minimum sized region to contain its phase space , and black holes ` pack states ' into these minimal regions .",
    "let us note some ways in which phase space considerations can impact the puzzles arising with black holes .      in the classical treatment of a black hole we do not see the states of the hole ( ` black holes have no hair ' ) .",
    "thus we miss an essential feature of the hole , since the entropy is actually very large .",
    "extremal holes may be the easiest to understand .",
    "we can start with the brane bound state at weak coupling @xmath17 ; this state has a large degeneracy .",
    "since the states are bps , we can follow them to strong coupling .",
    "the geometry develops a throat , and the throat gets deeper with increasing @xmath17 , but by continuity in @xmath17 we do not expect at any given @xmath17 to have an infinite throat with a horizon at the end .",
    "the ` caps ' at the end of the throat have a structure that reflects the particular microstate . in the 2-charge d1-d5 system",
    "the ` true charges ' d1,d5 give rise to a ` dipole ring ' which takes the form of a kk monopole times a @xmath8 .",
    "different shapes of this ring give different classical geometries .",
    "quantum fluctuations ( which we reviewed in this paper ) make the generic state a ` fuzzball ' with the same size as observed in the classical geometries .    for three and four charge systems",
    "the dipole charges give more complex structures to the cap , and large families of classical solutions have been found starting from these dipole charges @xcite . in the 4-charge solutions the dipoles are points in the noncompact space .",
    "as we go to more and more generic states , the number of these dipole charges can be expected to grow , and we will have a vast collection of ` branes at angles ' in the ` cap ' region @xcite .",
    "we can understand all d - branes as arising from tachyon condensation in other sets of branes and anti - branes ; this is the ` k - theory ' picture of d - branes .",
    "thus we can visualize the generic ` cap ' state as a wavefunction in this very complex potential made from an arbitrary number of branes .",
    "if the tachyon condenses to its minimum in a given charge sector then we see the bps dipole branes observed in the classical solutions @xcite , but more generally the system will just have a complicated wavefunction in this multi - dimensional tachyon potential .",
    "the entropy of non - bps holes can be understood in terms of brane - antibrane pairs @xcite , so for these holes we expect a similar potential with a large number of local extrema ; the slow decay by hawking radiation would then correspond to the system drifting to its true ground state .",
    "if this picture of black hole states is correct , then we must understand the entropy of the hole in terms of the number of metastable states possible in the tachyon potential arising from an arbitrary number of brane pairs .",
    "put another way , if we are given an energy @xmath188 , then the maximal entropy is not obtained by converting this energy into massless quanta , but rather by using it to create brane and anti - branes , which is a system with a large phase space , and gives a high degeneracy of states .",
    "the traditional puzzle with black holes has been the following .",
    "we have a given classical geometry .",
    "there seem to be no large corrections at the horizon .",
    "why should string theory change anything ?",
    "let us address this question in the context of extremal holes .",
    "the classical geometry has an infinite throat .",
    "nothing seems to be wrong with this geometry by itself .",
    "but the recent work on fuzzballs shows us that there are a large number of _ other _ states with the same mass and charge , where the throat behaves differently after a certain depth .",
    "why are these states relevant ?    if we quantize the system , we have one state per unit cell in phase space . but to find this unit cell , we first have to understand all the directions of this phase space . to illustrate this point schematically , consider a 1-dimensional space ( drawn as the horizontal line in fig.[phase ] ) .",
    "since this line is infinite , it would appear that there will be an infinite number of unit cells along its length . but",
    "suppose there was another direction @xmath189 to this phase space , and that the volume of phase space ( available at a given energy ) narrows down to the right as shown in the figure .",
    "now we see that beyond some point @xmath190 there is very little phase space left , and this available phase space might be able to hold only a finite number of states .",
    "axis denotes one direction of a phase space ; this would appear to have an infinite number of unit cells beyond the point @xmath190 .",
    "the @xmath189 axis denotes another direction of phase space ; since this narrows to the right there are only a finite number of states to the right of @xmath190 in the full phase space.,width=384 ]    it may be possible to see such a situation in the 2-charge extremal system .",
    "first let us split our d1-d5 system with charges @xmath29 into two smaller systems , with charges @xmath191 and @xmath192 respectively .",
    "the relative motion of these two objects is described by a moduli space metric , which we can find from @xcite by restricting their 3-charge answer to the case where only two charges are present .",
    "we find ( for small separations @xmath193 ) ds^2=(n^(1)_1n^(2)_5+n^(1)_5n^(2)_1)r^2(dr^2+r^2d_3 ^ 2)= ( n^(1)_1n^(2)_5+n^(1)_5n^(2)_1)[dr^2r^2+d_3 ^ 2 ] [ je ] we see that the angular part of this moduli space has a constant volume , while the radial part is an infinite line .",
    "( we set @xmath194 and find the moduli space metric @xmath195 for @xmath196 . )",
    "this suggests an infinite number of quantum states .",
    "we have a single throat that branches into two throats after a great depth , so we are quantizing some degrees of freedom of the geometry of the 2-charge throat . ]",
    "but we know that there are no throats longer than a maximal depth in the correct quantization of the 2-charge system , and there are a finite number of states overall . in the cft",
    "dual , the longest throat corresponds to a single ` component string ' of length @xmath197 @xcite . in the ns1-p duality frame",
    ", the longest throat corresponds to having a single vibration in the harmonic @xmath198 carrying all the momentum charge .",
    "we can not go to higher harmonics of vibration , since then we will need a fractional number of quanta to carry the given momentum charge",
    ". this fractional number of quanta can be thought of as an excitation that was allotted a fractional unit of phase space to exist ; such an excitation is not possible .",
    "the above considerations were arrived at using the cft dual , but the phase space of the d1-d5 system can also be quantized directly in the gravity description , and the same measure on phase space is obtained @xcite .",
    "thus we find that when we quantize the full phase space of the system , rather than just one direction like in ( [ je ] ) , then all throats longer than a given depth fall into a single wavefunction , and it does not make sense to explore the throat to arbitrary depths in the manner suggested by the classical metric .",
    "we hope to return to these issues in the future .",
