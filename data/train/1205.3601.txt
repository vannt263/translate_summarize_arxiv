    "in ref .  @xcite the author presented a so - called `` decoupling '' method that is based on the systematic use the real dirac matrices ( rdms ) in coupled linear optics .",
    "the rdms are constructed from four pairwise anti - commuting basic matrices with the `` metric tensor '' @xmath0 , formally written as : _ _ + _ _",
    "= 2g_. the remaining @xmath1 rdms are constructed as products of the basic matrices as described in the appendix .",
    "the use of the rdms enables to derive a straightforward method to transform transport matrices , force matrices ( `` symplices '' ) _ and _ @xmath2-matrices in such a way that the transformed variables are independent , i.e. decoupled .",
    "the reverse is required to generate multivariate normal distributions : a transformation that transforms linear independent distributions of variables in such a way that a given covariance matrix is generated .",
    "the idea therefore is the following : generate a set of independent normally distributed variables with given variances and apply the inverse of the decoupling transformation derived from the desired covariance matrix .",
    "this will couple the `` independent '' variables in exactly the desired way .",
    "the presented scheme assumes an even number of variables since it is based on canonical pairs , i.e. position @xmath3 and momentum @xmath4 - but it is always possible to ignore one of those variables .",
    "since the method is based on pairs of canonical variables , the decoupling scheme always treats two pairs of variables at a time , resulting in the use of @xmath5-matrices .",
    "if more than four random variables are required , the decoupling can be used iteratively in analogy to the jacobi diagonalization scheme for symmetric matrices  @xcite .",
    "in this section we give a brief summary of the major concept . given the following hamiltonian function h=12^t*a * , [ eq_hamiltonian ] where @xmath6 is a symmetric matrix and @xmath7 is a state - vector or `` spinor '' of the form @xmath8 .",
    "the state vector hence contains two pairs of canonical variables .",
    "the equations of motion ( eqom ) then have the familiar form",
    "q_i&=&hp_i + p_i&=&-hq_i , [ eq_eqom_classical ] or in vector notation : & = & _ 0_h + & = & * f * + [ eq_eqom_general ] where the _ force matrix _ @xmath9 is given as @xmath10 .",
    "the matrix @xmath11 is the symplectic unit matrix ( sometimes labeled @xmath12 or @xmath13 ) and is identified with the real dirac matrix @xmath11 ( see appendix ) .",
    "we define the symmetric matrix of second moments @xmath2 containing the variances as diagonal and the covariances as off - diagonal elements .",
    "the matrix @xmath14 is simply defined as the product of @xmath2 with @xmath11 : = _ 0 .",
    "[ eq_sdef ] both matrices , @xmath9 and @xmath14 , fulfill the following equation ( using @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) : ^t=_0*f*_0 .",
    "[ eq_symplex ] matrices that obey eq .",
    "[ eq_symplex ] have been named _",
    "symplices _ , but they are also called `` infinitesimally symplectic '' or `` hamiltonian '' matrices  @xcite .",
    "symplices allow superposition , i.e. any sum of symplices is a symplex , but only the product of anti - commuting symplices is a symplex  @xcite .",
    "any real - valued @xmath5-matrix @xmath17 can be written as a linear combination of real dirac matrices ( rdm ) : = _ k=0 ^ 15m_k_k . the rdm - coefficients @xmath18 can be computed from the matrix @xmath17 by : m_k=(_k^2)32(*m*_k+_k*m * ) , [ eq_rdmc ] where @xmath19 is the trace of @xmath20 .",
    "hence the rdms form a complete system of all real @xmath5-matrices , but only ten rdms fulfill eq .",
    "[ eq_symplex ] and are therefore symplices : the basic matrices @xmath21 and the six `` bi - vectors '' , i.e. the six possible products of two basic matrices .",
    "the symplices are the generators of symplectic transformations , i.e. the generators of the symplectic group .",
    "as well - known , the jacobi matrix of a canonical transformation is symplectic , i.e. it fulfills the following equation  @xcite : _ 0*m*^t=_0 .",
    "[ eq_msymplectic ] the eqom have the general solution ( t)=*m*(t , t_0)(t_0 ) , [ eq_transsolution ] where @xmath17 is a symplectic _ transfer matrix _ that is in case of constant forces given by ( t , t_0)=.

    "now we refer to the structural identity of the matrix @xmath14 with the force matrix @xmath9 .",
    "both are symplices and since a transformation that decouples @xmath9 has been shown to diagonalize the matrix @xmath6 of the hamiltonian  @xcite , it is clear that the same method can be used to diagonalize @xmath2 .",
    "the reverse of this transformation then generates the desired distribution from an initially uncorrelated @xmath2 .    instead of a cholesky - decomposition",
    "we may therefore use a symplectic similarity - transformation to generate the correlated distribution from an initially uncorrelated distribution . in the context of charged particle optics , the algorithm delivers even more useful information : the transformation matrix @xmath25 is the transport matrix that is required to generate an uncorrelated beam .",
