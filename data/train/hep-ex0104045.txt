    "radiative @xmath0 meson decays are sensitive to non - standard - model contributions .",
    "a standard model ( sm ) branching fraction calculation for @xmath10 that includes next - to - leading order qcd corrections has a precision of 10%  @xcite .",
    "experimental measurements of the branching fraction are useful for identifying or limiting non - sm theories  @xcite",
    ". the @xmath11 process may provide additional sensitivity to non - sm effects , a precise measurement of @xmath12 and direct cp violation within the sm framework .",
    "the exclusive channel @xmath7 can be distinguished from the @xmath13 signal utilizing good high momentum kaon identification devices .",
    "we have analyzed a large data sample collected at the @xmath1  resonance with the belle detector  @xcite at the kekb @xmath14 storage ring  @xcite .",
    "we used 6.1 million @xmath15 events for @xmath10 analysis and 11 million for other analyses .",
    "we have performed measurements of branching fractions for @xmath13 , @xmath16 and @xmath10 , and a search for @xmath7 .",
    "we also measured the partial rate asymmetry in @xmath17 .",
    "we will give the results with descriptions for the essential part of analyses in the following subsections .",
    "we did an exclusive reconstruction for @xmath13 , where @xmath18 is reconstructed from @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "a combined kaon - to - pion likelihood is constructed from the aerogel v cerenkov counters ( acc ) , the time - of - flight counter ( tof ) and the @xmath23 from the central drift chamber ( cdc ) .",
    "a @xmath24 separation cut is applied on the likelihood ratio .",
    "a @xmath25 invariant mass window of @xmath26 is taken around the nominal @xmath18 mass .",
    "a likelihood ratio cut is applied in order to suppress the @xmath27 background , where the likelihood ratio is calculated from the @xmath0 meson flight direction , the helicity angle of the @xmath18 decay , and an event shape variable which we call _ the super fox - wolfram _ ( sfw ) .",
    "the sfw variable is a fisher discriminant formed using fox - wolfram moments .",
    "the definition of sfw can be found in reference  @xcite .",
    "we extracted the signal yields by fitting the beam constrained mass ( @xmath28 ) distribution with an argus function for the background and a gaussian for the signal as shown in figure  [ fig : mbkst892 ] .",
    "we determined the branching fractions to be @xmath29 @xmath30    we then checked the partial rate asymmetry , @xmath31 where @xmath32 represents the yield and @xmath33 is the wrong tag fraction .",
    "@xmath34 is expected to be less than 1% in the sm .",
    "we use only _ self - tagging _ modes , namely we exclude the @xmath35 mode . thanks to belle s good kaon identification devices , the wrong tag fraction @xmath33 is only 1.2% .",
    "we have checked the intrinsic asymmetry in our analysis with an inclusive @xmath18 sample , in which the momentum range of the @xmath18 is adjusted to match our singal .",
    "we found that the intrinsic asymmetry is @xmath36 , and is consistent with zero .",
    "we extracted the partial yields @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "we calculated the partial rate asymmetry as @xmath39 and found it is consistent with zero .",
    "we performed a similar analysis with a @xmath25 invariant mass window of @xmath40 around the nominal @xmath41 mass .",
    "we removed the helicity angle from the likelihood ratio in order to check the helicity distribution .",
    "this is because there is an overlapping @xmath42 resonance which has a different spin and thus a different helicity distribution .",
    "we observed @xmath43 events as shown in figure  [ fig : mbk2st ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : mk2st ] , we see a resonance peak in the @xmath25 invariant mass spectrum . we fitted the helicity distribution with curves for spin-1 and spin-2 hypotheses as shown in figure  [ fig : helk2st ] and obtained the @xmath44 fraction to be ( @xmath45)% where the error is statistical only . assuming these are all @xmath44 events , we quote the branching fraction to be @xmath46      we combined @xmath47 instead of @xmath25 to search for @xmath7 .",
    "we took a mass window of @xmath48 around the nominal @xmath49 mass . to suppress the @xmath13 contribution",
    ", we vetoed kaons by a tight kaon - to - pion likelihood ratio cut , and vetoed the @xmath47 combination if its invariant mass with a @xmath25 mass hypothesis falls within a window of @xmath50 around the nominal @xmath18 mass .",
    "the @xmath3 background contribution is expected to be only 0.4 ( 0.02 ) events for @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "we observed 6 ( 1 ) candidates and a @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) event excess including @xmath3 background for @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) as shown in figure  [ fig : mbrho ] .",
    "since neither is significant , we set upper limits for the branching fractions @xmath57 and @xmath58 at 90% confidence level .",
    "we also set an upper limit on the @xmath59 to @xmath3 fraction , @xmath60 at 90% confidence level .",
    "a semi - inclusive reconstruction is performed by summing up multiple final states .",
    "we reconstruct the recoil @xmath62 system from one @xmath63 or @xmath64 and one to four pions of which at most one pion can be a @xmath65 . from @xmath62 and the most energetic photon candidate , we form two independent kinematic variables , @xmath28 and the energy difference @xmath66 in the @xmath1  rest frame .",
    "we also calculate the angle between the @xmath67 and the @xmath62 and require that they are back - to - back in the @xmath1  rest frame .",
    "we require an @xmath62 candidate to form a vertex with the beam profile constraint except in the case of the @xmath35 mode which has no charged track to form a vertex .",
    "when there are multiple candidates in an event , we choose the one with the best vertex confidence level .",
    "to solve the ambiguities due to neutral particles which do not affect the vertex , we choose the candidate for which the angle between the photon and the @xmath62 is the largest .    for the selected single candidate , we require sfw to be greater than 0.1 to suppress the background from @xmath27 light quark pair production .",
    "we also require the recoil mass to be less than @xmath68 to suppress the background from other @xmath15 decays .",
    "the sfw distributions for the signal and the @xmath27 background are shown in figure  [ fig : sfw ] .    in order to subtract the contribution from @xmath27 background , which is the main background in this analysis , we use the sfw sideband data ( sfw@xmath69 ) instead of the statistically limited off - resonance data .",
    "the sfw variable is tailored not to be correlated with @xmath28 , and hence the @xmath28 distributions in the signal region and in the sideband region are the same .",
    "we estimate the @xmath15 background by using monte carlo ( mc ) and subtract its contribution from the observed data .",
    "we then fit the observed @xmath28 spectrum ( figure  [ fig : mbxs ] ) to be sum of the sideband data and the signal mc floating the normalizations .",
    "we find a signal yield of @xmath70 events , where the first error is statistical and the second is the systematic error in our @xmath27 background estimation .    in the recoil mass spectrum ( figure  [ fig : mxs ] ) , we see a clear @xmath18 mass peak and a continuum contribution in the higher resonance region . therefore , we modeled the recoil mass system as a mixture of @xmath18 and a continuum contribution with the observed ratio of the yields in the @xmath18 region to the continuum region . for the continuum part of the recoil mass spectrum",
    ", we adopted a model proposed by kagan and neubert  @xcite with the input @xmath71 quark mass parameter equal to @xmath72 .",
    "we determined the branching fraction @xmath73 where the first error is statistical , the second is systematic and the third is the model error . in figure",
    "[ fig : egamma ] , we show the measured photon energy spectrum which is corrected for our recoil mass cut .",
    "this spectrum can be compared with the model .",
    "the measured branching fractions for @xmath13 and @xmath61 are consistent with the other experimental results  @xcite and/or the sm prediction  @xcite .",
    "we do not see a deviation from the sm prediction in the partial rate asymmetry in @xmath13 , either .",
