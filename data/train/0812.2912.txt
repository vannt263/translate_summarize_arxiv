    "it has long been known that globular cluster stars present some striking anomalies in their content in light elements whereas their heavy elements ( i.e. , fe - group , @xmath0-elements ) remain fairly constant from star to star ( with the notable exception of @xmath1  cen ) .",
    "while in all the galactic globular clusters studied so far one finds `` normal '' stars with detailed chemical compositions similar to those of field stars of same metallicity ( i.e. , same [ fe / h ] ) , one also observes numerous `` anomalous '' main sequence and red giant stars that are simultaneously deficient ( to various degrees ) in c , o , and mg , as well as enriched in n , na , and al ( for reviews see @xcite ) .    these abundance variations are expected to result from h - burning nucleosynthesis at high temperatures around @xmath2  k @xcite .",
    "such temperatures are not reached in the low - mass main sequence and rgb stars that are chemically peculiar , meaning that the stars inherited their abundance anomalies at stellar birth .    here",
    "we follow the work of @xcite and @xcite who propose that abundance anomalies are build up by fast rotating , fast evolving massive stars . during their main sequence evolution , rotationally - induced mixing transports elements synthesised in the convective h - burning core to the stellar surface . for stars heavier than 20  @xmath3 , the surface reaches break - up at the equator ( i.e. , the centrifugal equatorial force balances gravity ) , providing their initial rotational velocity is high enough .",
    "in such a situation , a slow mechanical wind develops at the equator and forms a disc around the stars similar to what happens to be stars @xcite .",
    "matter in discs is strongly enriched in h - burning products and has a slow escape velocity that allows it to stay in the potential well of the cluster . on the contrary ,",
    "matter released later through radiativelly - driven winds during most of the he - burning phase and then through sn explosion has a very high velocity and is lost by the cluster .",
    "therefore , new stars can form only from the matter available in discs with the abundance patterns we observe today .",
    "thus globular clusters can contain two populations of low - mass stars : a first generation which has the chemical composition of the material out of which the cluster formed ( similar to field stars with similar metallicity ) ; and a second generation of stars harbouring the abundance anomalies born from the ejecta of fast rotating massive stars .",
    "this scenario is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : selfenrich ] .",
    "based on the determination of the composition of giant stars in ngc  2808 by @xcite , @xcite determined that around 70% of stars present abundance anomalies in this specific cluster today .",
    "@xcite find similar results for ngc  6752 with their analysis of the data of @xcite : around 85% of the cluster stars ( of the sample of 120 stars ) present abundance anomalies .",
    "therefore most stars still evolving in globular clusters seem to be second generation stars .    how to produce such a high fraction of chemically peculiar stars ?",
    "the main problem is that assuming a @xcite imf for the polluters , the accumulated mass of the slow winds ejected by the fast rotating massive stars would only provide 10% of the total number of low - mass stars . to match the observations",
    "thus requires either ( a ) a flat imf with a slope of 0.55 instead of 1.35 ( salpeter s value ) , or ( b ) that 95% of the first generation stars have escaped the cluster @xcite . here",
    "we first verify whether such a high loss of stars is possible , and which are the main processes that could drive it .",
    "first we assume that the globular clusters display primordial mass segregation so that the massive stars are located at their center .",
    "since we expect that the formation of the second generation of low - mass stars happens locally around individual massive stars ( see @xcite for more details ) , the second generation of stars will also be initially more centrally concentrated than the first generation .",
    "in such a situation , two competitive processes act in the clusters : the loss of stars in the outer cluster parts will first reduce the number of bound first generation stars ; and the dynamical spread of the initially more concentrated second generation stars will stop this differential loss when the two populations are dynamically mixed .    our analysis , based on the n - body models computed by @xcite with the collisional aarseth n - body code nbody4 @xcite , is presented in detail in @xcite .    as these models have been computed for a single stellar population , we apply the following process to mimic the formation of a cluster with two dynamically distinct populations : we sort all the low - mass stars ( @xmath4  @xmath3 ) according to their specific energy ( i.e. , their energy per unit mass ) .",
    "we define the second stellar generation as the stars with lowest specific energies , ( i.e. , those which are most tightly bound to the cluster due to their small central distance and low velocity ) .",
    "the number of second generation stars is given by having their total number representing 10% of the total number of low - mass stars .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : distr ] one can see the radial distribution of the two populations at various epochs .",
    "initially , first generation stars show an extended distribution up to 40  pc whereas the second generation stars ( with low specific energy ) are concentrated within 6  pc around the centre .",
    "progressively the second generation stars spread out due to dynamical encounters so their radial distribution extends .",
    "however this process operates on long timescale : even after 5  gyr of evolution the two populations still have different distributions .",
    "the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : distr ] shows that after nearly 12  gyr of evolution ( slightly less than 3 passed relaxation times ) the two populations have similar radial distributions and can no longer be distinguished owing to their dynamical properties .",
    "as previously seen , the effect of the external potential of the galaxy on the cluster is to strip away stars lying in the outer part of the cluster .",
    "initially , as only stars of the first generation populate the outer part of the cluster owing to their high specific energy , only these first generation stars are lost in the early times .",
    "this lasts until the second generation stars migrate towards the outer part of the cluster .",
    "depending on the cluster mass , it takes between 1 to 4  gyr to start losing second generation stars .",
    "due to the time - delay to lose second generation stars , their remaining fraction in the cluster is always higher than that of the first generation stars except during the final stage of cluster dissolution . fig .  [",
    "fig : distr ] ( right panel ) quantifies this point by showing the time evolution of the number ratio of second to first generation stars . as a direct consequence of our selection procedure ,",
    "the initial ratio is 0.1 ; it then increases gradually with time and it tends to stay nearly constant as soon as the two distributions are similar . finally , at the time of cluster dissolution ( i.e. , when the cluster has lost 95% of its initial mass , indicated by the label `` dis '' in fig .",
    "[ fig : distr ] ) , large variations occur due to the low number of low - mass stars present in the cluster . in fig.[fig : distr ] ( right panel ) we have also indicated the number of passed relaxation times , showing that the increase of the number ratio lasts only 3 relaxation times .",
    "the fraction of second generation stars relative to first generation ones increases by a factor of 2.5 over the cluster history .",
    "therefore , these second generations stars can account for 25% of the low - mass stars present in the clusters .",
    "compared to the observed ratios ( 70% and 85% in ngc  2808 and ngc  6752 respectively ) the internal dynamical evolution and the dissolution due to the tidal forces of the host galaxy are not efficient enough .",
    "an additional mechanism is thus needed to expel the first generation stars more effectively .       and",
    "@xmath5.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    as it operates early in the cluster history ( a few million years after cluster formation at the latest ) , initial gas expulsion by supernovae is an ideal candidate for such a process . as the gas still present after the star formation is quickly removed , it ensues a strong lowering of the potential well of the cluster so that the outer parts of the cluster can become unbound .",
    "@xcite computed a grid of n - body models to study this process and its influence on cluster evolution by varying the free parameters : star formation efficiency , sfe , ratio between the half - mass and tidal radius , @xmath6 , and the ratio between the timescale for gas expulsion to the crossing time , @xmath7 .",
    "they show in particular that , in some extreme cases , the complete disruption of the cluster can be induced by gas expulsion .",
    "this process has also been used successfully by @xcite to explain the challenging correlation between the central concentration and the mass function of globular clusters as found by @xcite .",
    "we have applied the same method as the one we used in   2.2 to the models of @xcite .",
    "[ fig : ge ] shows that in the case of a cluster which loses around 90% of its stars , the ejection of stars from the cluster mostly concerns first generation ones . at the end of the computation only 5% of first generation stars",
    "remain bound to the cluster along with around half of second generation stars .",
    "therefore the number ratio between the second to first generation stars increases by a factor of 10 : half of the population of low - mass stars still populating the cluster are second generation stars . besides , the initial radial distribution is not totally erased by this mechanism as the second generation stars are still more centrally distributed .",
    "we can expect that this ratio will continue to increase in the long - term evolution of the cluster ( see decressin et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "thus if globular clusters are born mass segregated , dynamical processes ( gas expulsion , tidal stripping and two - body relaxation ) can explain the number fraction of second generation stars with abundance anomalies .",
    "similar conclusions have been reached by @xcite .",
    "as abundance variations in light elements are expected to be due to h - burning whose direct product is he , we expect that second generation stars are also enriched in he to some degree .",
    "unfortunately he abundance can not be directly measured in globular cluster stars and we have only indirect evidence for an overabundance in he .",
    "the globular clusters @xmath1  cen and ngc  2808 display multiple main sequences @xcite ; a double sub - giant branch is also found in ngc  1851 @xcite .",
    "such features can be understood if the stars present various he contents .",
    "he enrichment is also a possible explanation for the appearance of extreme horizontal branches seen for several globular clusters @xcite .      ) and initial he value ( 0.245 - 0.72 , mass fraction ) .",

    "white area indicates stars still on the main sequence after 15  gyr of evolution.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=48.0% ]    as explained in @xcite , matter stored in the discs around massive stars is heavily enriched with he .",
    "[ fig : herich ] ( left panel ) gives our expected theoretical distribution function of the he - value in low - mass stars in ngc  6752 .",
    "a main peak is present at @xmath8 and it extends up to 0.4 . however a long tail toward higher y - values is also present with around 12% of the stars with initial he value between 0.4 and 0.72 .    to assert the implications for globular clusters induced by this population of he - rich stars",
    "we have computed a grid of low - mass stellar models from 0.2 to 0.9  @xmath3 at a metallicity of @xmath9 ( similar to the metal - poor globular cluster ngc 6752 ) for initial he mass fraction between 0.245 and 0.72 with the stellar evolution code v2.92 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for more details ) .",
    "these models have been computed without any kind of mixing except for an instantaneous mixing in convection zones .",
    "the adopted mass - loss rate follows @xcite prescription ( with a parameter @xmath10 ) with a @xmath11 dependence .",

    "this last discrepancy could be attributed to the low mass - loss rate used in the stellar models which do not remove enough mass along the rgb and hence produce too cool stars on the hb . as the theoretical spread of the initial he is strongly affected by the dilution of the disc ejected by fast rotating massive stars and the ism , we plan to constrain this dilution with the observed sequences to check whether we are able to consistently reproduce both the abundance anomalies and the he - value inferred in globular clusters ( see decressin et al .",

    "the presence of he - rich stars can induce some additional uncertainties . let us note that they are the only physical parameter which broadens the main - sequence only to its left ( i.e. , blue ) side . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmd ] ( right panel ) we evaluate uncertainties related to he - rich stars : we try to reproduce a he - normal isochrone ( @xmath14 ) with a he - rich ( @xmath15 ) one .",

    "the differences between the he - rich with reddening and he - normal isochrones are small around the to , the main - sequence and the subgiant - branch .",
    "discrepancies appear along the rgb and at the level of the hb , where the normal he - rich isochrone is much less extended toward the blue .",
