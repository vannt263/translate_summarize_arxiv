    "the arguably most prominent functional limit theorem is donsker s invariance principle .",
    "it asserts that the distribution of a linear interpolation between the points of a suitably re - scaled random walk converges to the wiener measure on the space of continuous functions on @xmath2 , the nonnegative real half - line ; see , for example , @xcite , corollary 16.7 .",
    "besides the wiener process , there is another fundamental stochastic process , which plays an important role in many branches of probability theory and its applications , namely the poisson process .",
    "however , functional limit theorems involving the poisson process have found much less attention in the literature .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide a quantitative version of a functional limit theorem for poisson processes and to derive from it error bounds for the probabilistic approximation of u - statistics by a poisson , a compound poisson or a stable random variable .",
    "we demonstrate the versatility of our results by applying these bounds to functionals of random geometric graphs , distance - power statistics , nonintersecting flat processes and random polytopes .",
    "let us informally describe the set - up of this paper ; precise definitions and statements follow in section  [ secmain - result ] .",
    "let @xmath3 and @xmath4 be two measurable spaces ( some mild regularity assumptions , see below ) , let @xmath5 be a probability measure on @xmath6 and fix an integer @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , for each @xmath8 let @xmath9 be a symmetric mapping whose domain @xmath10 is a symmetric subset of @xmath11 .",
    "next , consider a collection @xmath12 of @xmath13 i.i.d .",
    "random elements @xmath14 of @xmath6 with distribution @xmath5 .",
    "we apply for each @xmath13 , @xmath15 to every @xmath1-tuple of distinct elements of @xmath16 .",
    "this induces a point process @xmath17 on @xmath18 of the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 stands for the unit mass dirac measure concentrated at @xmath22 .",
    "the motivation for studying the point processes @xmath17 as defined above comes from the theory of u - statistics and from a class of extreme value problems arising in stochastic geometry . at first ,",
    "if @xmath23 and @xmath24 , the points of @xmath17 can be regarded as the summands of the u - statistic @xmath25 these objects play a prominent role in large parts of probability theory and mathematical statistics , and an analysis of the point process of summands is helpful for the understanding of their ( asymptotic ) properties . on the other hand , in several problems arising in stochastic geometry ,",
    "one is interested in extreme values of the type @xmath26 in case that @xmath23 and @xmath27 . clearly , this minimum is the distance from the origin to the first point of the point process @xmath17 .",
    "for these reasons , a study of the point processes @xmath17 unifies both mentioned problems .    the intensity measure @xmath28 of @xmath17",
    "is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the descending factorial .",
    "our main result , theorem [ thmmain ] below , provides an upper bound for the kantorovich ",
    "rubinstein distance @xmath31 between @xmath32 and a poisson process @xmath33 on @xmath18 with finite intensity measure @xmath34 . here",
    ", the kantorovich  rubinstein distance is a variant of an optimal transportation distance , which measures the closeness between two point processes or , more precisely , their distributions . in particular , we show that @xmath17 converges in kantorovich ",
    "rubinstein distance , and thus in distribution to @xmath33 if @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes the total variation distance of measures on @xmath18 .",
    "more precisely , the upper bound for the kantorovich ",
    "rubinstein distance only depends on @xmath37 and the first two moments of @xmath38 .",
    "this is a functional version of the famous results by arratia , goldstein and gordon @xcite , and chen @xcite that `` two moments suffice for poisson approximation . ''",
    "besides the binomial process @xmath16 of @xmath39 independent and identically distributed points , we also allow the input process to be a poisson process on @xmath6 with a finite intensity measure . in some instances ,",
    "an underlying poisson process is more natural and sometimes even unavoidable , especially if the underlying point process on @xmath6 is supposed to have infinitely many points . to exploit this flexibility",
    ", we consider both set - ups in parallel .    poisson process approximation has been studied by several authors by means of stein s method , but to the best of our knowledge this is the first paper where the kantorovich ",
    "rubinstein distance is investigated .",
    "the works of barbour @xcite , barbour and brown @xcite and the last chapter of the monograph @xcite of barbour , holst and janson concern poisson process approximation in the total variation distance .",
    "but since the total variation distance is not suitable for all problems and since the so - called _ stein magic factors _ do not get small if @xmath40 is large ( in contrast to classical poisson approximation ) , one often uses weaker notions of distance . starting with the work of barbour and brown @xcite and barbour , holst and janson @xcite ,",
    "this has been done by brown , chen , schuhmacher , weinberg and xia @xcite .",
    "our work goes in the opposite direction since the kantorovich ",
    "rubinstein distance between point processes is stronger than the total variation distance in the sense that convergence in kantorovich ",
    "rubinstein distance implies convergence in total variation distance , but not vice versa . roughly speaking and in a transferred sense , the kantorovich ",
    "rubinstein distance is related to the total variation distance between point processes as the wasserstein distance is related to the total variation distance for integer - valued random variables . since its test functions",
    "are allowed to take values other than zero and one , the kantorovich ",
    "rubinstein distance is more sensitive to the behavior and the geometry of the compared point processes than the total variation distance .",
    "let us further remark that in the recent paper @xcite , schuhmacher and stucki consider the total variation distance between two gibbs processes .",
    "this includes poisson process approximation as a special case .",
    "however , the approximated point processes of the present paper do not , in general , satisfy the technical conditions assumed in @xcite since they are not necessarily hereditary .",
    "besides the notion of distance and its connection to the theory of optimal transportation , the other main ingredient of our approach is a functional version of stein s method for poisson process approximation .",
    "it relies on a glauber dynamics representation for poisson processes and the malliavin formalism .",
    "more precisely , we use an integration - by - parts argument on the target space and then a commutation relation between the discrete gradient on that space and the semi - group associated with the glauber dynamics .",
    "this way we avoid the explicit computation and investigation of a solution of the stein equation .",
    "we would like to highlight that our approach is generic and depends only on the underlying random structure ( here , a binomial or a poisson process ) and not on a very specific model so that extensions to other probabilistic frameworks ( such as gaussian random measures or rademacher sequences ) should also be possible .",
    "however , they are beyond the scope of this paper and will be treated elsewhere .    to demonstrate the versatility of our new functional limit theorem , we consider probabilistic approximations of u - statistics over binomial or poisson input processes . in a first regime , we consider the poisson approximation of u - statistics and provide an error bound for the wasserstein distance .",
    "our result improves and extends earlier works of barbour and eagleson @xcite and peccati @xcite .",
    "the second regime concerns compound poisson approximation of u - statistics in total variation distance . here",
    ", we do not impose any conditions on the nature of the compound poisson distribution , which is allowed to be discrete or continuous .",
    "in contrast , previous results for the compound poisson approximation via stein s method only deal with the discrete case ; see , for example , the work of barbour , chen and loh @xcite , the survey @xcite of barbour and chryssaphinou and especially the paper @xcite of eichelsbacher and roos , who consider u - statistics over a binomial input process . in this light",
    ", we generalize the results of @xcite to a larger class of limiting distributions and also to the case of an underlying poisson process . in a third regime",
    ", we use our functional limit theorem to investigate probabilistic approximations of u - statistics by @xmath41-stable random variables with @xmath42 and to derive explicit error bounds for the kolmogorov distance . in their previous work @xcite ,",
    "dabrowski et al .",
    "also obtained @xmath43-stable limits for u - statistics from point process convergence results . however",
    ", their technique does not allow any conclusion about a rate of convergence .",
    "finally , we apply our general result to problems arising in stochastic geometry .",
    "random geometric graphs are one of the fundamental models of spatial stochastics ; see @xcite , for example .",
    "we derive limit theorems for several u - statistics of random geometric graphs , where the limiting distributions are poisson or compound poisson , and show a new point process limit theorem for the midpoints of short edges . as further examples , we consider distance - power statistics with @xmath43-stable limit distributions , midpoints between nonintersecting poisson @xmath44-flats which are close together and the diameter of random polytopes with vertices on the sphere .    in a natural way",
    "our paper continues the line of research on point process convergence and extreme values initiated by the second and the third author in , where the proofs are based on the main result of @xcite and the underlying point process has to be poisson .",
    "in contrast to these previous works our technique also allows us to deal with an underlying binomial process and delivers in both cases bounds for the kantorovich ",
    "rubinstein distance .",
    "furthermore , the bounds derived here improve the rates of convergence of some of the scalar limit theorems from @xcite .",
    "our findings also complement the works @xcite and @xcite of the first author with joulin and savy , concerning the kantorovich ",
    "rubinstein distance on configuration spaces and related notions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "before we present our main result for poisson process convergence in section  [ secmain - result ] , we recall in section  [ secpreliminaries ] some necessary notation and results about point processes and also summarize some facts from convex geometry which are important for our examples from stochastic geometry .",
    "the proof of our main result in section  [ secproof - main - result ] is prepared by a brief discussion of the underlying stein principle in section  [ secgener - stein - princ ] and the glauber dynamics , a key step in our argument , in section  [ secglaub - dynam - poiss ] .",
    "section  [ secapplications ] is devoted to applications of our functional limit theorem to probabilistic approximations of u - statistics and to problems from stochastic geometry .",

    "we will write @xmath54 if @xmath22 is charged by the measure @xmath55 and also use the set - notation @xmath56 to indicate that @xmath57 is a sub - configuration of @xmath58 ( with a similar meaning we also understand @xmath59 ) .",
