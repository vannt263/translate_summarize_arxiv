    "uniform algebras have been extensively investigated because of their importance in the theory of uniform approximation and as examples of complex banach algebras . as enquiry broadens one may ask whether analogous algebras exist when a complete valued field other than the complex numbers is used as the underlying field of scalars over which the algebra is a vector space . in many situations the analogous algebras obtained are without qualifying subalgebras . for example",
    "if @xmath0 is a complete valued field other than the complex numbers then the stone - weierstrass theorem , or its non - archimedean generalisation by kaplansky , shows that the banach @xmath0-algebra @xmath1 of all continuous @xmath0-valued functions on a compact hausdorff space @xmath2 , which we also require to be totally disconnected in the non - archimedean setting , is without a proper subalgebra that satisfies the conditions of the theorem , see section [ sec : swei ] .",
    "however , in the commutative , archimedean setting , kulkarni and limaye in a paper from 1981 , @xcite , introduced the now familiar theory of real function algebras which provides examples with proper qualifying subalgebras .",
    "one important departure in the definition of real function algebras from that of complex uniform algebras is that they are real banach algebras of continuous complex - valued functions .",
    "other appropriately analogous algebras of continuous functions that take values in some complete valued field or division ring extending the field of scalars over which the algebra is a vector space also exist .",
    "one benefit of establishing such analogs of uniform algebras is that they increase the variety of complete normed algebras that we know can be represented by algebras of continuous functions .    in this paper",
    "we survey commutative and non - commutative results in the archimedean settings and also offer some non - archimedean examples .",
    "the results on generalising uniform algebras over all complete valued fields , as the single theory presented at the 6th conference on function spaces at siu - edwardsville , will be presented in the author s thesis and later publications .",
    "for non - complex uniform algebras we need to consider which fields have a complete valuation i.e. a complete multiplicative norm .",
    "the trivial valuation taking values in @xmath3 can be applied to any field @xmath0 and induces the trivial topology .",
    "it is the most basic example of a complete non - archimedean valuation which are those complete valuations that satisfy the strong triangle inequality , @xmath4 if the valuation on a valued field is non - archimedean then we call the valued field a non - archimedean field , else we call the valued field archimedean .",
    "every complete archimedean field is path - connected whereas every complete non - archimedean field is totally disconnected .",
    "it turns out that almost all complete valued fields are non - archimedean with @xmath5 and @xmath6 being the only two archimedean exceptions up to isomorphism as topological fields .",
    "this in part follows from the gelfand - mazur theorem , see @xcite for details .",
    "there are examples of complete non - archimedean fields of non - zero characteristic with non - trivial valuation . for each",
    "there is a prime @xmath7 such that the field is a transcendental extension of the finite field @xmath8 of @xmath7 elements .",
    "one example of this sort is the valued field of formal laurent series @xmath9 in one variable over @xmath8 with termwise addition , multiplication in the form of the cauchy product and valuation given at zero by @xmath10 and on the units @xmath11 by , @xmath12 we note here that the only valuation on a finite field is the trivial valuation .    on the other hand complete",
    "valued fields of characteristic zero necessarily contain one of the completions of the rational numbers @xmath13 .",
    "the levi - civita field , see @xcite , is such a valued field .",
    "a total order can be put on the levi - civita field such that the order topology agrees with the topology induced by the field s valuation which is non - trivial .",
    "this might be useful to those interested in generalising the theory of c*-algebras to new fields where there is a need to define positive elements .",
    "the completion of @xmath13 that the levi - civita field contains is in fact @xmath13 itself since the valuation when restricted to @xmath13 is trivial .",
    "the non - trivial completions of the rational numbers are given by ostrowski s theorem , see @xcite .",
    "each non - trivial valuation on the field of rational numbers is equivalent either to the absolute value function or to one of the @xmath7-adic valuations for some prime @xmath7 .",
    "[ thr : ostr ]    concerning @xmath7-adic theory , for a given prime @xmath7 , each element of @xmath13 can be uniquely expanded in the form of a formal laurent series evaluated at @xmath7 with integer coefficients belonging to @xmath14 .",
    "for example for @xmath15 we have , @xmath16 similar to the case of the decimal expansion , a @xmath7-adic expansion of an element of @xmath13 will have a term such that the coefficients of all later terms , to its right , form a repeating sequence .",
    "for a given prime @xmath7 the @xmath7-adic valuation on @xmath13 is given at zero by @xmath17 and at any unit @xmath18 by , @xmath19 the function @xmath20 is often extended to zero by @xmath21 and may be referred to as the valuation logarithm . denoting the trivial valuation on @xmath13 by @xmath22 and the absolute value function by @xmath23 , the different valuations on @xmath13 , when restricted to the units @xmath24 , are related by the equation , @xmath25 for a given prime @xmath7 the valued field @xmath26 of @xmath7-adic numbers is the completion of @xmath13 with respect to the valuation @xmath27 and it is the valued field of all formal laurent series evaluated at @xmath7 with integer coefficients belonging to @xmath14 . for each prime @xmath7",

    "moreover as a field , rather than as a valued field , @xmath26 has an embedding into @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath7-adic valuation on @xmath26 can then be prolongated to a complete valuation on the complex numbers which in this case as a valued field we denote as @xmath28 .",
    "unlike @xmath6 however , @xmath28 is not locally compact .    more generally , and unlike in the archimedean setting , we have the following theorem .",
    "every complete non - archimedean field @xmath0 has a non - trivial extension @xmath29 for which the complete valuation on @xmath0 can be prolongated to a complete valuation on @xmath29 .",

    "[ def : ualg ]    some authors take definition [ def : ualg ] to be a representation of uniform algebras and take a uniform algebra @xmath31 to be a complex unital banach algebra with square preserving norm , @xmath36 for all @xmath37 .",
    "this is quite legitimate since the gelfand transform shows us that every such algebra is isometrically isomorphic to an algebra conforming to definition [ def : ualg ] . in this paper",
    "we mainly consider non - complex analogs of definition [ def : ualg ] but acknowledge the importance of representation results , many of which can be found in the references .",
    "the most obvious non - complex analog of definition [ def : ualg ] is obtained by simply replacing the complex numbers in the definition by some other complete valued field @xmath0 . in this case , whilst @xmath1 will be complete and contain the constants , we need to take care concerning the topology on @xmath2 when @xmath0 is non - archimedean .",
    "let @xmath0 be a complete , non - archimedean , valued field and let @xmath1 be the algebra of all continuous @xmath0-valued functions defined on a compact , hausdorff space @xmath2 .",

    "now since @xmath2 is a totally disconnected , compact , hausdorff space , @xmath53 has a neighborhood base of clopen sets , see theorem 29.7 of @xcite .",
    "hence there is a clopen subset @xmath54 of @xmath2 with @xmath55 .",
    "the function @xmath43 given by @xmath56 and @xmath57 is continuous as required .",
    "we now give the proof of theorem [ thr : xtop ] .    with reference to lemma [ lem : urys ] it remains to show that @xmath1 separates the points of @xmath2 only if @xmath2 is totally disconnected .",

    "if we take @xmath31 to be unital then condition ( b ) in theorem [ thr : kapl ] is automatically satisfied and the theorem is analogous to the real version of the stone - weierstrass theorem .    in section [ sec : ncom ]",

    "further by the definition of @xmath82 and the fact that @xmath83 we have that @xmath81 is the @xmath5-algebra of all uniform limits of polynomials on @xmath69 with real coefficients . hence @xmath81 separates the points of @xmath69 since it contains the function @xmath84 .",
