    ", we want to optimize not only the location , but also the shape of actuators , without any specific restriction on the regularity of @xmath7 .",
    "the literature on optimal sensor or actuator location problems is abundant in engineering applications ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) , where the aim is often to optimize the number , the place and the type of sensors or actuators in order to improve the estimation of the state of the system .",
    "fields of applications are very numerous and concern for example active structural acoustics , piezoelectric actuators , vibration control in mechanical structures , damage detection and chemical reactions , just to name a few of them . in most of these applications",
    "the method consists of approximating appropriately the problem by selecting a finite number of possible optimal candidates and of recasting the problem as a finite - dimensional combinatorial optimization problem . in many of these contributions the sensors or actuators",
    "have a prescribed shape ( for instance , balls with a prescribed radius ) and then the problem consists of placing optimally a finite number of points ( the centers of the balls ) and thus is finite - dimensional , since the class of optimal designs is replaced with a compact finite - dimensional set .",
    "we stress that , in the present paper , the shape of the control domain is an unknown of the optimization procedure .    from the mathematical point of view , the issue of studying a relaxed version of optimal design problems for the shape and position of sensors or actuators has been investigated in a series of articles . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors study a homogenized version of the optimal location of controllers for the heat equation problem ( for fixed initial data ) , noticing that such problems are often ill - posed . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors consider a similar problem and study the asymptotic behavior as the final time @xmath13 goes to infinity of the solutions of the relaxed problem ; they prove that optimal designs converge to an optimal relaxed design of the corresponding two - phase optimization problem for the stationary heat equation .",
    "we also mention @xcite where , for fixed initial data , numerical investigations are used to provide evidence that the optimal location of null - controllers of the heat equation problem is an ill - posed problem .    concerning the problem of optimal shape and location of sensors for fixed initial data ( instead of controllers in @xcite ) we proved in @xcite that it is always well posed for heat , wave or schrdinger equations ( in the sense that no relaxation phenomenon occurs ) ; we showed that the complexity of the optimal set depends on the regularity of the initial data , and in particular we proved that , even for smooth initial data , the optimal set may be of fractal type ( and there is no relaxation ) . in @xcite , we modeled and solved the problem of optimal shape and location of the observation domain having a prescribed measure .",
    "this problem was motivated by the question of shaping and placing sensors in some domain in such a way to optimize the quality of the observation .    here",
    ", we rather investigate the dual question of the best shape and location of actuators .",
    "in @xcite , the authors investigate numerical approximations of exact or trajectory controls for the heat equation , by developing a numerical version of the so - called transmutation method .      in the present paper ,",
    "our objective is to search the internal control domain over _ all _ possible subsets of @xmath8 , without assuming any a priori regularity .",
    "we optimize not only the placement but also the shape of the actuators .",
    "note that , for any problem consisting of optimizing the quality of the control , certainly the best strategy consists of controlling the solutions over the whole domain @xmath8 .",
    "this is however obviously not reasonable and in practice the domain covered by actuators is limited , due for instance to cost considerations . from the mathematical point of view",
    ", we model this basic limitation by considering as the set of unknowns , the set of all possible measurable subsets @xmath7 of @xmath8 that are of lebesgue measure @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is some fixed real number .",
    "any such subset @xmath7 represents the actuators put in @xmath8 . finally , for mathematical reasons",
    ", it is more convenient to assimilate a measurable subdomain @xmath7 of @xmath8 to its characteristic function @xmath39 , vanishing outside @xmath7 and equal to 1 else .",
    "hence , let us introduce the class of admissible control domains",
    "@xmath40    in view of modeling the optimal design of actuators , a first approach consists of minimizing the functional @xmath41 over the set @xmath42 .",
    "however , even for simple choices of control domains @xmath7 , the quantity @xmath35 is not explicitly computable and therefore the cost functional is hard to handle . besides , note that the moment control operator norm @xmath35 is _ deterministic _ and thus provides an account for the _ worst possible case _ ; in this sense , it is a _",
    "pessimistic _ constant .",
    "one can argue that , in practice , when running a large number of experiments , it is expected that the worst possible case does not occur so often .",
    "for these reasons , we are next going to consider an average criterion which , in some sense , does not take into account rare events .",
    "nevertheless , we stress that the issue of minimizing @xmath35 with respect to the domain @xmath7 has not only a mathematical interest , but appears also naturally in some practical situations , where it is imperative that the worst possible case be avoided , even if it is a rare event .",
    "we refer to the conclusion section [ sec : conclpb ] for some comments about such a problem .",
    "the same kind of difficulty arises when modeling optimal design problems for sensors , as discussed in @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose another approach based on the controllability result stated in lemma [ lemm : contheat ] , and on a randomization argument reflecting what happens when a large number of experiments is expected to be done .",
    "we are going to use a probabilistic argument , by considering random initial data .",
    "we follow the approach developed in @xcite .",
    "let us fix an arbitrary initial datum @xmath43 of the controlled system , with fourier coefficients defined by @xmath44 these coefficients are now randomized according to @xmath45 for every @xmath22 , where @xmath46 is a sequence of independent real random variables on a probability space @xmath47 , having mean equal to @xmath15 , variance equal to @xmath48 , and with a super exponential decay is said to have a _ super - exponential decay _ whenever @xmath49 ]",

    "we propose , then , to model the problem of best actuator shape and location as the problem of minimizing the averaged functional @xmath54 over @xmath36 , where @xmath55 is the expectation over the probability space @xmath47 .",
