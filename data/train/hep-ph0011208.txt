    "we start with general questions , such as : do we produce excited matter with sufficiently large scattering rate able to ensure local equilibration ? if so , what is its eos and whether it is close to results obtained in lattice simulations ? how one can tell the bang from a fizzle , experimentally ?",
    "there are 3 effects one can discuss : ( i ) longitudinal work ; ( ii ) radial transverse flow ; and ( iii ) elliptic flow .",
    "we address two last ones below .    before we go to specific description of concepts and data on flow ,",
    "let us discuss in general why we think that rather different phenomena at ags / sps and rhic energy domain can nevertheless be described in a unified way by hydro+cascade model .",
    "those types of models are the only ones known , which can incorporate correctly the fact that hadrons and partons live in different vacua , separated by significant `` bag term '' in eos .",
    "this phenomenon generates soft `` mixed phase '' , in which energy density @xmath0 grows but temperature t and pressure p do not .",
    "purely cascade models with partons / hadrons miss this central point , and therefore have very unrealistic eos .",
    "the hydro - to - hadrons model @xcite include hydro plus transfer to hadronic cascade ( rqmd ) , in order not to worry about freeze - out of different species , resonance decays etc .",
    "the transfer is smooth enough because the effective eos of rqmd and our hadronic matter is about the same .    at sps",
    "the evolution starts close to rather soft `` mixed phase '' ( as lattice thermodynamics tells us ) , then proceeding to stiffer pion gas : therefore most of the radial expansion is pion - driven and happens very late .",
    "there are many proves of that : one @xcite is that @xmath1 which participate little in hadronic rescattering practically do not have it .",
    "let us first characterize flows in general .",
    "at rhic we start well above the qcd phase transition , and so expect the so called `` qgp push '' , then softer mixed phase , and finally a stiff hadronic phase again .",
    "( now @xmath1 is expected to flow more ! )    in non - central collisions at sps the initial almond for @xmath2 collisions retains basically the same almond shape : matter does not move till the final velocity @xmath3 is only obtained close to the end of the expansion . at rhic the initial almond is transformed into a completely different object called the",
    "_ `` nutcracker '' _",
    "@xcite , which consists of two separated shells of matter and a small `` nut '' in the center .",
    "it happens by the time 8 - 10 fm / c , and then shells continue to move out in hadronic phase , slowly dissolving .",
    "radial flow is usually characterized by the slope parameter t : @xmath4 .",
    "t is @xmath5 temperature : it incorporates random thermal motion and collective transverse velocity .",
    "its prediction for various eos ( marked by latent heat , say lh8 means latent heat 800 @xmath6 , see fig.[fig_1]a ) is shown in the following figure , for protons and pions versus basically collision energy expressed in terms of multiplicity , see fig.[fig_1]b .",
    "one can see that different eos show different growth , although picture is rather simple : the softer the eos the less flow .",
    "the speed of sound for a set of eos used ( a ) and resulting transverse mass slope t ( b ) versus mid - rapidity ( y=0 ) charged particle multiplicity , for auau collisions with b=6 .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=240 ]   the speed of sound for a set of eos used ( a ) and resulting transverse mass slope t ( b ) versus mid - rapidity ( y=0 ) charged particle multiplicity , for auau collisions with b=6 .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=240 ]      if there is no correlation between space and momentum , there is no elliptic flow .",
    "for example , @xmath7 model like @xcite in which transverse momentum increase in aa is due to initial state interaction , like in pa collision , can not have elliptic flow . indeed hijing parton model @xcite without rescatterng (",
    "an example of the model which produce a `` firework '' type final state ) has nearly zero ( actually slightly negative ) @xmath8 .",
    "string models like urqmd @xcite and rqmd itself also do not produce pressure at early time , and predicted respectively @xmath9 @xmath8 at rhic than at sps those are eliminated , as soon as the first star data @xcite have shown that at rhic @xmath8 is in fact twice larger than at sps !",
    "but hydro knows about geometry of the excited system : the pressure gradient is mostly along the narrow part of the almond .",
    "the elliptic flow is quantified experimentally by the elliptic flow parameter @xmath10    the _ energy dependence _ of @xmath11 does not appear to be simple ( in contrast to radial flow ) .",
    "furthermore , we have found that if one is making eos softer the @xmath8 decreases non - monotonously , first decreasing and then increasing again .",
    "it means for a given experimental value of @xmath11 there are two possible scenarios , we called the `` qgp push '' and `` burning almond '' . in the first case the initial almond transfers to nutcracker , in which spatial anisotropy decreases and even change sign . in the second",
    ", the almond dries out , and spatial anisotropy actually grows .",
    "so , in order to answer the question whether the `` qgp push '' scenario we are waiting for is or is not the case , some further studies are needed .",
    "in particular , the scan in rhic energies downward would be very useful .",
    "( a ) the elliptic flow parameter @xmath12 versus multiplicity at b=6 fm , for different eos .",
    "( b ) @xmath12 is now plotted versus impact parameter b , described experimentally by the number of participant nucleons , for rhic star and sps na49 experiments .",

    "one can see that the agreement becomes much better at rhic .",
    "furthermore , one may notice that deviation from linear dependence we predict becomes visible at sps for more peripheral collisions with @xmath13 or so , while at rhic only the most peripheral point , with @xmath14 show such deviation .",
    "this clearly shows that hydrodynamical regime in general works much better at rhic . on the other hand , a models of single re - scattering ( e.g. @xcite ) which approximately describes peripheral sps data",
    "is completely inconsistent with this linear rise , seen both at sps and rhic .",
    "the discussion of the role of s , c quarks in excited hadronic matter has a peculiar history . in the first paper addressing the subject @xcite it was argued that qgp with @xmath15 should quickly equilibrate even charm , because of high rate of gluon - induced processes , and suggested to use it as a qgp signature . as for strangeness ,",
    "the @xmath16 was considered to be too small to be useful for that purposes .",
    "however later , rafelski et al @xcite had nevertheless suggested that the strangeness enhancement for exactly that role .",
    "the experiments at ags / sps indeed found lager strangeness per participant baryon ( or per pion ) in aa collisions than in pp , which is more pronounced for hyperons and especially for @xmath1 .",
    "however , the following two features has been also found .",
    "first , strangeness enhancement started at very low energies , at ags .",
    "second , its magnitude basically described by the statistical model ( see e.g.@xcite ) , by an equilibrium at @xmath17 and @xmath18 depending on the collision energy . from this point of view people rather called a phenomenon a `` disappearance of strangeness suppression '' , which has been present in pp .",
    "but even this interpretation has been recently challenged in @xcite .",
    "already 25 years ago the issue of correct account for strangeness in small statistical systems has been addressed in @xcite .",
    "the main point is , the usual statistical expressions say for @xmath19 ratio , being the ratio of integrated bose distribution , is only valid if the average particle number @xmath20 .",
    "if it is not so , exact strangeness conservation should be enforced while considering all possible states of the system , say containing @xmath21 pairs , etc . as a result , @xmath22 depends on volume ( or @xmath23 ) quadratically , till @xmath24 . in @xmath25 collisions at few gev",
    "range the data were in perfect agreement with this prediction already in 1975 @xcite .",
    "we are however still lacking a demonstration of where that happens for say @xmath26 : even most peripheral data at sps do not show a predicted transition to small - volume regime , their ratio to multiplicity remains flat .",
    "probably lighter ions are needed to see it .    in summary :",
    "whatever strange it may appear to us , composition of hadrons , including strange ones , seem to be thermal @xmath27 in aa ( at ags / sps energies ) and pp collisions . in the latter case",
    "it is believed to come from string fragmentation : so aa can either be also string - based , or come from qgp , which ( by coincidence ? ) have a @xmath28 value which mimic string decays .",
    "anti - baryon ratios , like many others , can be rather accurately characterized by the so - called _ chemical _ freeze - out stage with a common temperature @xmath29 @xmath30 ( values depend on collision energy )",
    ". however , the kinetics of other particles and anti - baryons can not be the same . the number of pions , kaons , etc .",
    "are not subject to significant changes when the system evolves from @xmath29 to @xmath31 : thus _ over - saturation _ appears , the effective pion fugacity @xmath32 the situation for antibaryons is different because the pertinent annihilation cross section is _ not small _ , @xmath33  mb .",
    "the time in which a give antinucleon is eaten is only @xmath34 and so naively one might expect most of the antiprotons to be annihilated , and various transport calculations ( arc , urqmd ) have indeed been unable to account for the measured number , falling short by significant factors .",
    "speculations have been put forward : either a reduction of the annihilation rate or an enhanced production .",
    "inverse reactions , ignored in event generators , are however _ not small _ @xcite @xmath35 \\ \\left[z_p \\",
    "z_{\\bar p }",
    "\\    -   z_\\pi^ { n } \\right]\\ ] ] the condition that this reaction goes on implies @xcite @xmath36 which leads to predictions consistent with the experimental value of @xmath37 ( na44 ) .",
    "note that it is very multi - pion reaction , with n=6 - 7 .    after the paper by rapp and myself , c.greiner and s.leupold @xcite generalized it further , to @xmath38 where @xmath39 .",
    "similar multi - meson annihilation can also explain the long - standing puzzle about multiple production _ anti - hyperons_.      charm production at sps is due to hard gg collisions , which are obviously able to produce somewhat larger amount of it , compared to its equilibrium value at @xmath41 .",
    "direct measurements are still in the future , but we should hardly expect any surprises here .",
    "( the na50 medium mass dilepton excess fits nicely to thermal dilepton rate @xcite , so i do not think it is a charm enhancement . )",
    "do @xmath42 we observe in aa collisions know about hadronic matter which surrounds it , or their cross section is too small and too absorptive ( leading to @xmath43 pairs ) that all of them we see just jump intact directly from the primary production point ? the latter remains the prevailing view in the field , although it has been challenged lately .",
    "although @xmath44 ratio starts decreasing at rather peripheral collisions / small a , as larger radius of @xmath45 suggests larger cross section , it then stabilizes at @xmath46 .",
    "furthermore , as noticed in @xcite , this number is consistent with _ the same _",
    "@xmath17 which fits all other ratios .",
    "this leads to an idea that the observed @xmath45 is excited from @xmath40 .",
    "much more radical idea has been put forward in @xcite : the number of @xmath40 itself is in agreement with the statistical model , provided the total charm fugacity is fixed to the parton model production .",
    "if it is not a coincidence , it then implies that @xmath40 may in fact be created from the same heat bath as all other hadrons .",
    "if so , the individual string scenario is of course out of the window , and the qgp scenario ( with some extra charm added to it ) is in .",
    "much more charm is expected at rhic : it makes recombination of floating charm pairs into charmonium states even more likely .",
    "the issue has been studied in recent paper @xcite : the conclusion is that we should in fact expect a _ charmonium enhancement _ at rhic .",
    "unlike pp collisions , the aa ones demonstrate small fluctuations of gaussian shape , as measured e.g. by na49 .",
    "it is basically a consequence of a basic theorem of probability theory , roughly stating that any distribution with a maximum in high power becomes gaussian .",
    "still , it is quite striking how far this gaussian goes : no deviations from it is seen for few decades , as far as data go .",
    "no trace of any large fluctuations , dcc or other bubbles , and all events with the same impact parameter are basically alike .",
    "the question then is whether the @xmath47 of those gaussians is understood .",
    "the short answer is yes . somewhat longer answer is that one should separate @xcite fluctuations of two types , of intensive or extensive variables .",
    "the latter is e.g. total charge multiplicity : it obtains about equal contributions from the initial ( due to fluctuations in spectators ) and final stage ( resonances ) .",
    "the former ( e.g. particle ratios like @xmath48 ) are well described by resonances at freezeout .    to give some example , consider fluctuations in charged multiplicity measured by na49 at 5% centrality:@xmath49 , while poisson statistics ( independent production ) gives 1 in the rhs .",
    "statistical fluctuations in a resonance gas increase the rhs .",
    "example : if all pions would originate from @xmath50 , and rho would be random , then the rhs would be 2 .",
    "account for equilibrium composition lead however to the gaussian width of only about 1.5 @xcite .",
    "correlations coming from fluctuation in the number of participants further increase it @xcite : see the comparison in the figure [ fig_fluct ] :    = 3.5 in    -0.1 in    good examples of intensive variable fluctuations are those in the mean @xmath51 ( in an event ) or in electric charge q ( same as of the @xmath48 ratio ) .",
    "resonances again : e.g. @xmath50 does not lead to q but contribute to multiplicity @xmath52 , not 1 as for poisson .",
    "it is what is actually observed for central collisions by na49 .      in order to do so ,",
    "we need a telescope looking back into the past , through the clouds of hadronic matter . how to make it has been recently suggested in refs @xcite .",
    "the idea is to use _ long - wavelength fluctuations of conserved quantities _ , which have slow relaxation .",
    "example : primordial fluctuations in microwave background give us `` frozen plasma oscillations '' at big bang .",
    "can we find similar signal in the `` little bang '' ?",
    "yes : if relax.time is longer than lifetime of hadronic stage the fluctuations we would see are `` primordial ones '' , from the qgp which are factor @xmath53 smaller .",
    "quantitative studies have been recently done by stephanov and myself @xcite .",
    "fluctuations are governed by langevin eqn @xmath54 and we calculated @xmath55 for pions in collisions .",
    "basically we found that at rhic / sps pion diffuse during hadronic stage by about 2 units of rapidity .",
    "na49 data we had are in acceptance @xmath56 and show perfect agreement with equilibrium resonance gas .",
    "star detector may have @xmath57 and additional deviation from 1 by about 20% - quite observable .",
    "baryon number fluctuations idea can not work because we do not see neutrons .",
    "*  if hydro description plus lattice - like eos makes sense , we found that the qcd phase transition plays different role at ags / sps and rhic : it makes the eos effectively soft in the former case but stiff at high energy , providing early `` qgp push '' . *  collective flow , especially its elliptic component , is very robust measure of the pressure in the system .",
    "star data at rhic , which demonstrate increase of elliptic flow by factor 2 , contradicts to string - based models and also mini - jet models without rescattering .",
    "hydro - based model , especially h2h model with hadronic cascades , can describe these data very accurately .",
    "still two solutions seem to be possible , one with strong qgp push ( predicted by lattice - based eos ) and another with longer - time burning . *  strangeness seem to be well equilibrated in any collisions , and thus is not a qgp signature . whether @xmath40 can obtain significant contribution from equilibrated charm at sps",
    "is strongly debated : it should however be the case at rhic .",
    "*  event - by - event fluctuations are mostly due to final state interaction between secondaries , and available data are in agreement with equilibrium resonance gas calculations . *",
    " potential observations of `` primordial charge fluctuations '' are limited by their relaxation time , mostly due to pion diffusion in rapidity .",
    "the outlook depends on experimental acceptance : available calculations suggest that wide star acceptance can be sufficient to see 10 - 15 percent modification of charge fluctuations .",
