    "was performed by the hipparcos satellite .",
    "however , due to the relatively bright magnitude limit of the hipparcos sample ( @xmath8 ) , m dwarfs observed by hipparcos are saturated in sdss photometry , hindering the construction of a color  absolute magnitude relation ( cmr ) in native sdss filters .",
    "a few parallax estimates of sdss m dwarfs have been obtained ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "sdss photometry was used to target objects for spectroscopic followup , primarily galaxies @xcite and quasars @xcite .",
    "approximately 460,000 stellar spectra were also obtained both as targeted and serendipitous observations .",
    "twin fiber - fed spectrographs collected 640 observations simultaneously , with individual 1520minute exposures being co - added for a typical total exposure time of @xmath9 45 minutes .",
    "these medium  resolution ( @xmath15 ) spectra cover the entire optical bandpass ( 3800 - 9200  ) .",
    "the absolute astrometric precision of sdss is @xmath16 in each coordinate @xcite .",
    "proper motions for sdss objects were calculated by matching to the usno - b survey @xcite .",
    "the proper motions have a baseline of @xmath9 50 years , and a typical precision of @xmath9 3 mas yr@xmath17 in right ascension and declination .    in",
    ", we described the sdss dr7 spectra that we compiled into the largest spectroscopic catalog of m dwarfs ever constructed , containing @xmath9 70,000 stars .",
    "briefly , the catalog was obtained by color selection of stars with @xmath18 and @xmath19 , before correcting for galactic reddening @xcite .",
    "each star was processed with the hammer idl package @xcite .",
    "the hammer provides spectral type estimates and measures a number of spectral features , including h@xmath20 equivalent width and various tio and cah bandhead strengths .",
    "each spectrum was then visually inspected and non - m dwarf contaminants were culled from the catalog .",
    "spectral types were determined by comparing to the sdss templates @xcite .",
    "the rvs were measured by cross  correlating each spectrum with the appropriate template from @xcite , with a precision of @xmath9 7 km s@xmath17 .",
    "see for more detailed information about the selection and characteristics of the dr7 catalog .",
    "for the sample used in the statistical parallax analysis , we required that stars have well  measured proper motions and radial velocities , and precise photometry ( see @xcite for information on photometric flag cuts , and @xcite for our kinematic quality flags ) .",
    "our quality cuts reduced the original sample to 40,963 stars .",
    "we employed the maximum likelihood formulation of classical statistical parallax analysis as presented by @xcite and used previously to analyze rr lyrae stars and cepheids @xcite .",
    "a variation of the model was used to investigate the kinematics of the nearby m dwarfs from the pmsu sample @xcite .",
    "briefly , this statistical parallax method models the velocity distribution of a homogeneous stellar population with nine kinematic parameters , including the three velocities of the reflex solar motion , and the three directions and three dispersions of the velocity ellipsoid , which describes the random and peculiar velocities of the population .",
    "the stars are assumed to have an absolute magnitude with some intrinsic dispersion , and these two additional parameters determine the distance used to transform the observed proper motions into transverse velocities .",
    "the eleven parameters used in the model are described in table [ table : parameters ] .",
    "the observational data needed for the analysis are the position , apparent magnitude ( corrected for galactic extinction ) , proper motions and radial velocity for each star in the sample .",
    "the uncertainties in the data are used to assign appropriate weights in the solution .",
    "we solved for the eleven parameters in the model simultaneously by maximizing the likelihood using geometric simplex optimization @xcite .",
    "uncertainties in the parameters were determined by numerical computation of the derivative of each parameter individually , while keeping all other parameters fixed .",
    "the maximum likelihood equations and simplex method are described in detail in @xcite .    with any multi ",
    "parameter fit , sensible constraints are necessary to ensure the model does not prefer an unrealistic portion of @xmath21 space . for this analysis",
    ", we fixed one parameter , @xmath22 .",
    "this parameter is related to the spread in absolute magnitude , @xmath23 by the following equation from @xcite : @xmath24/(0.04~\\ln10 ) \\label{eqn : sigk}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the spread in absolute magnitude for a given luminosity bin , and @xmath22 is the spread in @xmath25 which is a distance scale parameter .",
    "the absolute magnitude is related to @xmath25 through the following equation : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is an initial estimate of the absolute magnitude .",
    "we fixed @xmath22 at four values : 0.05 , 0.1 , 0.2 and 0.3 .",
    "usually @xmath28 , so @xmath29 corresponds to @xmath30 which is the typical dispersion in absolute magnitude for low  mass stars @xcite .",
    "lrr @xmath31 & km s@xmath17 & velocity dispersion in radial direction + @xmath32 & km s@xmath17 & velocity dispersion in orbital direction + @xmath33 & km s@xmath17 & velocity dispersion in vertical direction + * @xmath34 & radians & orientation of velocity ellipsoid + @xmath3 & km s@xmath17 & solar peculiar motion ( @xmath0 ) + @xmath35 & km s@xmath17 & solar peculiar motion ( @xmath36 ) + @xmath4 & km s@xmath17 & solar peculiar motion ( @xmath37 ) + @xmath25 & & distance scale + @xmath22 & & dispersion in distance scale + [ table : parameters ] *      our spectroscopic sample is much larger than was available for previous statistical parallax studies , which contained observations of a few hundred or less objects .",
    "thus , we were able to divide the sample into smaller subsamples , selected on color , spectral type , magnetic activity ( as traced by h@xmath20 ) , metallicity ( using the @xmath2 parameter of @xcite ) , position on the sky ( northern and southern galactic hemispheres ) , distance ( estimated from the @xmath38 cmr relation from @xcite ) , and galactic height ( discussed further below ) .",
    "we required at least 100 stars in each subsample to ensure a meaningful solution .",
    "table [ table : subsamples ] lists the properties of the various subsamples .",
    "the color , spectral type , metallicity and magnetic activity subsamples were chosen to explore intrinsic variations within the m dwarf population , as traced by their absolute magnitudes and kinematics .",
    "the position and distance subsets were examined to ensure that we were not biased by extinction or proper motion limits . while the majority of our sample is contained at high galactic latitudes ( @xmath39 ) in low extinction regions (",
    "the median extinction in @xmath0 is 0.07 mags ) , some sightlines to the south ( through the plane ) may be affected by extinction and reddening .",
    "current efforts to model the 3-d dust distribution within the sdss footprint ( jones et al . , private communication",
    ") will improve the extinction and reddening estimates for these stars .",
    "our proper motion catalog , described in @xcite has a precision limit of 3 mas yr@xmath17 . for a typical thin disk star with a transverse velocity of @xmath9 10 km s@xmath17",
    ", this limit corresponds to a limiting distance of @xmath9 700 pc . beyond this distance , only stars with larger transverse motions would be measured with precise proper motions , artificially biasing the measured velocity dispersion .",
    "thus , two distance limits were explored : stars with @xmath40 pc and @xmath41 pc .",
    "the 500 pc cut corresponds to a more conservative estimate of the proper motion precision .",
    "the effects of these distance limits are shown in figure [ fig : dists_disps ] . early  type m dwarfs , which are found at larger distances , are biased towards larger velocity dispersions if a distance limit is not enforced .",
    "the 500 pc and 700 pc limits give similar results , so we adopt a @xmath41 pc limit for the remainder of this study . further kinematic analysis is discussed in  [ sec : kinematics ] .",
    "the @xmath41 pc cut limits the total number of stars in our sample to 22,542 . in table",
    "[ table : heights ] we report the median , minimum and maximum heights above the plane for the stars in our @xmath41 pc sample .",
    "the heights were measured using distances from the @xmath42 color  magnitude relation of @xcite .",
    "dispersions vs. spectral type for @xmath40 pc ( open triangles ) , @xmath41 pc ( open squares ) and no distance limit ( filled circles ) . including more distant stars beyond our proper motion",
    "precision limit artificially inflates the measured dispersions for early  type stars . ]    finally , to probe changes in the kinematics and absolute magnitude as a function of height in the milky way disk , we divided each spectral type and color bin according to the independent position altitude ( ipa ) . at a given spectral type , bins in apparent magnitude",
    "will correspond to spherical shells in space .",
    "the ipa cuts are slices in galactic height , defined as : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the observed @xmath0band magnitude and @xmath45 is the galactic latitude of the star .",
    "we stress that the ipa can only be used for relative comparisons within the same intrinsic luminosity bins .",
    "that is , m0 and m6 stars with the same ipa value will be located at very different galactic heights .",
    "the ipa is useful as it avoids the assumption of an absolute magnitude , allowing an independent determination for each ipa subset .",
    "it is based entirely on observable properties , and is somewhat analogous to the often  used reduced proper motion @xcite .",

    "for a given run , the simplex optimization iterated 5,000 times .",

    "this ensured that the simplex operator had sufficient freedom to explore parameter space and converged to the best ( maximum likelihood ) answer .",
    "typically , convergence was obtained after 25,000 iterations .",
    "the results of our analysis are detailed below .",
    "the outputs from the code returned three major results : the absolute magnitude of a given stellar sample , the sun s velocity with respect to that sample , and the velocity ellipsoid that describes the peculiar motions of the sample .",
    "each of these results are examined , and compared to previous investigations . in the discussion",
    ", we use the @xmath29 results as our fiducial value , since it corresponds to @xmath49 which is observed for nearby stars with trigonometric parallaxes in the @xmath42 color  magnitude diagram .",
    "traditionally , colors or spectral types have been employed to estimate absolute magnitude when trigonometric parallaxes were not available .",
    "these are often referred to as photometric and spectroscopic parallaxes , respectively . in figure",
    "[ fig : mr_sp_rz ] , we show the spectroscopic ( left panel ) and photometric ( right panel ) parallax relations for m dwarfs , compared to previous studies in the @xmath13 system @xcite .",
    "the open circles are nearby low  mass stars with accurate trigonometric parallaxes , tabulated in @xcite . using the hammer @xcite",
    ", we manually assigned a spectral type to each nearby star , using archival spectra from multiple sources : the pmsu study @xcite , sdss , the local star sample of @xcite and the dwarfarchives website . while many of the spectral types agreed with previous results , we did find some disagreements at the level of @xmath50 spectral classes",
    "therefore , we include updated spectral types for these nearby stars in table [ table : spec_types ] .",
    "the left panel of figure [ fig : mr_sp_rz ] highlights the large dispersion in @xmath1 as a function of spectral type .",
    "the typical spread is @xmath51 mag , increasing to @xmath52 magnitudes near type m4 , nearly double the spread for a given @xmath48 color bin .",
    "thus , we strongly suggest that spectral type should _ not _ be used as a tracer of absolute magnitude for m dwarfs . the use of half  interger spectral types may decrease the observed scatter in figure [ fig : mr_sp_rz ] .",
    "however , half ",
    "integer spectral types would require higher resolution and higher s / n spectra , which is not practical for this type of large survey sample",
    ". furthermore , half ",
    "interger spectral type standards are not defined for the entire m dwarf sequence @xcite .",
    "finally , half  integer types will likely span a larger color range than the color bins we have used ( see for a discussion of spectral types and mean colors ) .",
    "the left panel of figure [ fig : mr_sp_rz ] also displays disagreement between our statistical parallax results ( solid black , red and blue lines and filled circles ) and the nearby star sample at later types .",
    "this is due to a systematic color difference within a given spectral type bin between the two samples .",
    "that is , the nearby star sample is systematically redder than the sdss stars at a given spectral type , possibly due to the small number of nearby stars in these bins . thus , the sdss stars have an absolute magnitude ( at a given spectral type ) that is appropriate for the bluer , more luminous stars of that type .",
    "this effect disappears when @xmath48 color is substituted for spectral type ( figure [ fig : mr_sp_rz ] , right panel ) .",
    "the right panel of figure [ fig : mr_sp_rz ] shows our statistical parallax @xmath42 relation , along with the results of previous studies @xcite .",
    "overplotted with open circles are the absolute magnitudes and colors from the nearby star sample listed in table [ table : spec_types ] .",
    "note that the dispersion in absolute magnitude as a function of color is significantly smaller than that shown in left panel of figure [ fig : mr_sp_rz ] , indicating that the @xmath48 color is a much better tracer of absolute magnitude .",
    "furthermore , the discrepancy in mean color for a given spectral type between the nearby star sample and sdss stars is not evident .",
    "we reiterate that colors , rather than spectral types , are preferred for absolute magnitude and hence distance estimation for m dwarfs .      due to the large spread in @xmath1 as a function of spectral type",
    ", we focus our absolute magnitude analysis on our color subsamples ( i.e. , the right panel of figure [ fig : mr_sp_rz ] ) .",
    "our results are shown in the solid black , red and blue lines and filled circles in figure [ fig : mr_sp_rz ] .",
    "there are a few notable trends .",
    "first , the bifurcated main sequence at blue colors ( earlier spectral types ) indicates that active , early ",
    "type m dwarfs are intrinsically more luminous than their inactive counterparts",
    ". recent observations of eclipsing binaries @xcite and active , single stars suggest that active stars possess larger radii than inactive dwarfs .",
    "however , possible changes in effective temperature and luminosity have not been well constrained .",
    "models predict both unchanged or decreased @xcite luminosity , while some observations suggest that active low ",
    "mass dwarfs are over - luminous compared to their model predictions @xcite .",
    "a similar effect was observed in the pmsu sample , where active m dwarfs were brighter in @xmath35 than inactive stars ( figure 4 of @xcite ) .",
    "the behavior evidenced in figure [ fig : mr_sp_rz ] suggests that active , early ",
    "type m dwarfs are @xmath53 mag brighter in @xmath1 , which could be explained if they have larger radii than inactive stars at the same spectral type or color . direct interferometric measurements of stellar radii are necessary to independently quantify the amount the radius changes for an individual star , since our statistical analysis is performed on subsamples of stars that span a ( small but nonzero ) range of temperature .",
    "we note that many close binaries are unresolved in sdss photometry .",
    "binarity may increase activity in early m dwarfs in close orbits , and could explain some of the absolute magnitude differences for those bins .    at blue colors ( @xmath54 ) , the inactive and total sample absolute magnitudes fall below the mean locus of nearby trigonometric parallax stars . since the nearby stars are composed of a mix of active and inactive stars , activity is likely not the only important effect .",
    "we therefore next investigate the effects of metallicity on @xmath1 and attempt to isolate them from those traced by chromospheric activity .      while magnetic activity may affect the radius of a star , metallicity can alter the star s effective temperature and luminosity , manifesting as a change in absolute magnitude . at a given color ( or spectral type ) , stars with lower metallicities will exhibit fainter absolute magnitudes @xcite . without precise metallicities and trigonometric parallaxes for all the m dwarfs in our sample , we can not directly examine this effect .",
    "there are some promising metallicity estimators for low  mass stars being developed in the near - ir @xcite , but these are not applicable to sdss spectroscopy .",
    "we therefore investigated the effects of metallicity using the @xmath2 parameter , as defined by @xcite .",
    "@xmath2 is a relative metallicity proxy which uses the relative strengths of cah and tio bands to discriminate between stars of different composition .",
    "it can be employed as a rough tracer of @xmath55 $ ] , with @xmath56 corresponding to solar metallicity and @xmath57 corresponding to @xmath55 \\sim -1 $ ] @xcite .",
    "we note that the @xmath55 , \\zeta$ ] relation is only calibrated over spectral types m0-m3 and suffers from large spreads near solar metallicity . in figure [ fig : mr_sp_rz_zeta ] , we plot the absolute magnitudes for two bins in @xmath2 as a function of spectral type ( left panel ) and @xmath48 color ( right panel ) for active ( solid lines ) and inactive ( dashed lines ) stars . table [ table : abs_mags ] gives the @xmath1 results for the various @xmath48 , activity and @xmath2 bins .",
    "the spread in each bin is @xmath58 mags , set by the choice of @xmath59 0.2 . as with any magnitude limited survey ( such as sdss ) , @xcite bias can arise . for surveys with complicated selection effects , a magnitude ",
    "independent correction is preferred @xcite .",
    "for an exponential galactic disk and @xmath49 , the malmquist correction is 0.15 mags @xcite .",
    "this correction has been applied to the values reported in table [ table : abs_mags ] , and is much smaller than the reported uncertainty .",
    "figure [ fig : mr_sp_rz_zeta ] demonstrates that for stars with similar chromospheric properties , the lower metallicity ones have fainter absolute magnitudes , at the same color or spectral type .",
    "this is consistent with cluster studies within the sdss footprint @xcite and trigonometric parallax studies of subdwarfs @xcite .",
    "active stars at the same metallicity are brighter than their inactive counterparts , but figure [ fig : mr_sp_rz_zeta ] shows that both metallicity and activity are important for determining the luminosity of an individual star . at a fixed @xmath2 ,",
    "the difference in @xmath1 is consistent with figure [ fig : mr_sp_rz ] , with early  type active stars being @xmath53 mag brighter , and the difference diminishing at later spectral types .",
    "a similar offset was also measured for the same stars in @xmath60 .",
    "the total sdss sample is overplotted in each figure with a solid black line .",
    "the early  type stars , which are seen at larger distances due to sdss magnitude limits ( see table [ table : heights ] ) , fall near the lower metallicity , inactive loci , while the later type stars , seen closer to the sun , are consistent with solar metallicities and active stars .",
    "this suggests that the low ",
    "mass dwarfs are tracing a metallicity gradient similar to the one observed in sdss observations of higher  mass stars @xcite , and also explains why the sdss sample falls below the locus of nearby stars at early types ( right panel of figure [ fig : mr_sp_rz ] ) .",
    "we also note that the activity  metallicity loci appear to converge near m5 ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "this behavior is not well explained , but may be linked to the transition between a partially and fully convective stellar interior that occurs near that spectral type / color .",
    "perhaps this transition , which alters the efficiency of energy transport in the star , also regulates the luminosity at the surface .",
    "finally , we examined the ipa and hemisphere subsamples .",
    "no significant differences were observed in the spectroscopic or photometric parallax relations with respect to position in the galaxy .",
    "a trend with ipa was expected , since this proxy for height probably traces metallicity .",
    "the lack of a gradient is probably due to stars at various heights being scattered into the same ipa bin due to photometric errors .",
