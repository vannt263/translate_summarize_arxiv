    "in the presence of random effects , dynamics of systems in engineering and science is often modeled by stochastic differential equatinos ( sdes ) driven by gaussian or non - gaussian processes .",
    "the solutions of sdes are often defined by ito or stratonovich integrals . when the excitation is parametric gaussian white noise , stratonovich sdes are different from the corresponding ito sdes : they have an additional term , the so - called wz correction term @xcite .",
    "the studies in @xcite attribute the extra term to the conversion from physical white noise to ideal white noise .",
    "for poisson white noise excitation , the correction terms for converting stratonovich sdes into ito sdes are first presented by di paola and falsone @xcite .",
    "although some disagreement has been brought up concerning di paola and falsone s correction term in earlier days @xcite , the stratonovich sdes proposed in @xcite have been verified extensively and are widely used to study stochastic dynamical systems under poisson white noise excitation @xcite .",
    "the main objective of this short communication is to give an alternative expression of di paola and falsone s formula .",
    "compared with the original one , the alternative formula is applicable under more general condition and shows better performance in numerical computation .",
    "note that we consider only the one - dimensional cases .",
    "the conclusion can be generalized to high - dimensional cases which , however , will not be discussed in this short communication .",
    "consider a dynamical system governed by @xmath0 where @xmath1 represents the state variable , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are deterministic functions of @xmath1 and @xmath4 , @xmath5 is poisson white noise expressed as @xmath6 in eq .",
    "( [ section1_poissonwhitenoise ] ) , @xmath7 is a poisson process with intensity parameter @xmath8 , @xmath9 is a dirac function at @xmath10 , @xmath11 is a random variable representing the @xmath12-th impulse . the poisson white noise @xmath5 is regarded as the formal derivative of some compound poisson process @xmath13 , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a the step function .    in ito sense , ( [ section1_tmp1 ] )",
    "is often written in the form @xmath16 di paola and falsone suggest to interpret ( [ section1_tmp1 ] ) as @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 ( [ section1_sdes ] ) is often called the stratonovich sde for ( [ section1_tmp1 ] ) @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath19 , and ( [ section1_tmpp1 ] ) implies that @xmath20    the effectiveness of di paola and falsone s formula expressed by ( [ section1_sdes ] ) has been verified extensively @xcite .",
    "define @xmath21 as @xmath22 where @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) are defined by ( [ section1_dg ] ) . using the notation @xmath25 defined in ( [ section2_1 ] ) ,",
    "we can write the stratonovich sde ( [ section1_sdes ] ) as @xmath26 construct an ordinary differential equation(ode ) as @xmath27 we claim that @xmath28 as defined in is the solution of the above ode  ( [ section2_ode ] ) at @xmath29 . the proof is given as follows .",
    "first , we check the existence and uniqueness of solution for ( [ section2_ode ] ) .",
    "it is well known that if the function @xmath30 is lipschitz continuous , then the existence and uniqueness of ( [ section2_ode ] ) can be guaranteed . since ( [ section2_1 ] )",
    "requires the function @xmath31 be analytic with respect to @xmath32 @xcite , which implies lipschitz continuity , the existence and uniqueness of the solution follows .",
    "take taylor expansion of @xmath33 at @xmath34 , then ( [ section2_ode ] ) becomes @xmath35 where @xmath36    in the following , we show by induction that @xmath37 for @xmath38 , we obtain from ( [ section2_3 ] ) and ( [ section2_ode ] ) that @xmath39 which means that ( [ section2_5 ] ) is true for @xmath38 .",
    "suppose ( [ section2_5 ] ) is true for @xmath40 , i.e. , @xmath41 then we get @xmath42 which means that ( [ section2_5 ] ) is also true for @xmath43 . now",
    "the proof of ( [ section2_5 ] ) is complete .    substituting ( [ section2_5 ] ) into ( [ section2_4 ] ) , and using the fact that @xmath44 we get @xmath45 integrating from @xmath46 to @xmath8 at both sides of ( [ section2_6 ] ) , we get @xmath47 comparing ( [ section2_7 ] ) with ( [ section2_1 ] )",
    ", we see the equivalence @xmath48 where the right - hand side @xmath49 is the solution of the initial value problem ( [ section2_ode ] ) at @xmath50 .",
    "in other words , we obtain an equivalent and alternative expression for the stratonovich sde ( [ section1_sdes ] ) or @xmath51 where @xmath49 is the solution of the ode ( [ section2_ode ] ) at @xmath50 .",
    "as shown in section @xmath52 , when @xmath30 is analytic , @xmath53 defined in ( [ section2_1 ] ) is equivalent to @xmath49 obtained from the ode ( [ section2_ode ] ) , i.e. , the two forms of sdes , and are equivalent .",
    "however , compared with ( [ section1_sdes ] ) , ( [ ssde ] ) has significant advantages in the following aspects .",
    "first , for a given @xmath31 , one immediate advantage of the alternative expression over ( [ section1_sdes ] ) is that it is much easier to obtain analytical solution from the ode than finding the sum of the infinite taylor series in .",
    "second , the proposed alternative expression ( [ ssde ] ) is applicable under much more general condition than the original one ( [ section1_sdes ] ) .",
    "for example , when @xmath30 is only continuous or piecewise continuous rather than analytic , ( [ ssde ] ) is still valid while ( [ section1_sdes ] ) fails to exist .",
    "more importantly , the new expression ( [ ssde ] ) could have significantly improved performance in numerical implementation than the original expression ( [ section1_sdes ] ) .",
    "the form in ( [ section2_1 ] ) is actually the taylor expansion of the solution of ( [ section2_ode ] ) , which requires computing the high - order derivatives of the function @xmath30 and possibly take a large number of terms to achieve high accuracy .",
    "however , since the alternative form ( [ ssde ] ) is given in form of ode , it can be solved by numerous algorithms such as runge - kutta or multistep methods , which could have much better convergence and stability properties than taylor expansion methods .",
    "the readers are referred to any numerical analysis book such as @xcite for more details about the runge - kutta , multistep , or taylor expansion methods for solving ordinary differential equations numerically .",
    "we note that the alternative expression , as given in ( [ ssde ] ) , turns out to be a special case of the marcus integrals , which have been defined for general semimartingale with jumps . for more details about the marcus integral and its application ,",
    "readers are referred to @xcite .",
    "take @xmath56 , and @xmath57 , the sde ( [ section1_sdes ] ) becomes @xmath58 where @xmath59 is expressed , by di paola and falsone s formula , as @xmath60 or by the alternative expression , as the solution of the following ode at @xmath61 , @xmath62      in the simulation , the compound poisson process @xmath13 is taken as @xmath64 wher @xmath7 is a poisson process with intensity parameter as @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) are normally distributed random numbers independent of each other .    when no jumps occur , @xmath68 and we solve ( [ example_5 ] ) by second order runge - kutta method with time step as @xmath69 .",
    "we compute the jump of the solution @xmath70 by di paola and falsone s formula and the alternative formula , respectively .",
    "for the former , we truncate the infinite consequence by taking the first @xmath71 terms , and for the latter , we solve ode ( [ example_6 ] ) numerically by uisng second order runge - kuta method with step size equal to @xmath72 .",
    "figure 1 shows one random path of the poisson compound process , and figure 2 compares the corresponding computational results with the theoretical one .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "2 that when the jumps are computed by the alternative formula , the numerical result agrees very well with the theoretical one .",
    "however , when using di paola and falsone s formula , the numerical result deviates from the theoretical one significantly , especially when the jump size is relatively large . we note that the accuracy for di paola and falsone s formula could be improved by keeping more terms when truncating the infinite series",
    "however , the number of terms needed to achieve the desired accuracy with di paola and falsone s formula is not easy to predict . the alternative formula is preferred partly because its accuracy can be easily controlled by the step size and the order the runge - kutta or other methods ."
