    "one of remarkable discovery in knot theory is the jones polynomial , and it is not only of mathematical interest but also an essential ingredient to quantum theory @xcite . in 2004 ,",
    "lomonaco and kauffman introduced knot mosaic system to give a definition of quantum knot system @xcite . this definition is intended to represent an actual physical quantum system .",
    "these quantum knots are superpositions of knots whose projections can be constructed as grids consisting of suitably connected tiles .",
    "it is known that all tame knots can be constructed in this way .    in this paper",
    "we introduce two variants of a knot mosaic , which are common features in physics and mathematics .",
    "one is a period knot mosaic in the whole plane whose periodic patches are rectangles .",
    "the other is a toroidal knot mosaic on the torus by identifying opposite boundary edges of a knot mosaic properly up to cyclic rotations , due to the topology of the torus .",
    "the latter was introduced by carlisle and laufer  @xcite . note that if we project a knot onto the torus instead of the plane , we can usually lower the mosaic number that is another interesting invariant in knot mosaic theory .",
    "this paper is inspired from question 9 in  @xcite about the enumeration of knot mosaics , and exercise 1 in  @xcite for knot mosaics on the torus .",
    "the authors have presented several results in the research program related to the cardinality of knot mosaics in the series of papers @xcite .",
    "we have developed a partition matrix argument to count knot mosaics of small size  @xcite .",
    "this argument was later generalized to give an algorithm producing the exact enumeration of knot mosaics of any sizes , which uses a recursion formula of so - called state matrices  @xcite . also we refer  @xcite for another application of this algorithm to the enumeration of independent vertex sets in grid graphs .",
    "we apply the algorithm used in  @xcite to count all period knot mosaics and toroidal knot mosaics .",
    "the main difference from the classical knot mosaic theory is that one must ensure that the boundary tiles match appropriately .",
    "we first count period knot mosaics in section  [ sec : period ] , and then count toroidal knot mosaics by considering equivalence classes of them under the cyclic rotations in both vertical and horizontal directions in section  [ sec : toroidal ] .",
    "we also present the asymptotic behavior of the growth rates of their cardinality .",
    "throughout this paper , the term ` knot ' means either a knot or a link .",

    "note that @xmath8 has @xmath9 elements .",
    "a _ connection point _ of a mosaic tile is defined as the midpoint of a mosaic tile edge that is also the endpoint of a curve drawn on the tile .",
    "two tiles in a mosaic are called _ contiguous _ if they lie immediately next to each other in either the same row or the same column .",
    "we also say that two tiles are _",
    "@xmath10-contiguous _ if they lie on the opposite ends in either the same row or the same column .",
    "a mosaic is called _ suitably connected _ if any pair of contiguous mosaic tiles have or do not have connection points simultaneously on their common edge .",
    "we also say that a mosaic is _",
    "suitably @xmath10-connected _ if any pair of @xmath10-contiguous mosaic tiles have or do not have connection points simultaneously on their edges at the boundary of the mosaic .",

    "two mosaics illustrated in figure  [ fig : mosaic ] represent a non - knot @xmath13mosaic and the trefoil knot @xmath14mosaic .",
    "several results about @xmath12 were founded by the authors such as its lower and upper bounds in  @xcite and the precise values of @xmath12 for @xmath15 in  @xcite .",
    "recently the authors also constructed an algorithm producing the precise value of @xmath12 in general that uses a recursive matrix - relation that turns out to be remarkably efficient to count knot mosaics .",

    "the algorithm used in theorem  [ thm : knot ] will be applied in the enumeration of the following period and toroidal knot mosaics .",
    "we now consider knot mosaics covering the whole plane in periodic patterns , especially whose periodic patches are rectangles .",

    "since all @xmath75 states can be appeared as a state of connection points where @xmath63 and @xmath64 meet , we get @xmath82 this implies that @xmath83 .",
