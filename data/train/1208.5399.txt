    "the weak energy condition ( wec ) of classical general relativity holds if all observers measure the local energy density of matter to be nonnegative . expressed in terms of the stress - energy tensor @xmath0 ,",
    "the wec amounts to the inequality @xmath1 for all timelike vectors @xmath2 .",
    "this condition , and others like it , were introduced as conditions to model generic matter distributions in the discussion of results such as singularity theorems .",
    "the energy conditions are obeyed by many ( though not all ) classical theories of interest and have a central place in mathematical general relativity .",
    "however , it has long been known that quantum field theory , our most successful fundamental matter model , is incompatible with these energy conditions  @xcite .",
    "this raises many questions , for example : should one doubt the validity of the singularity theorems for realistic matter ? can quantum fields be used to support ` exotic ' spacetime geometries ( time machines , wormholes , warp drives ... ) which require energy - condition - violating stress - energy tensors if they are to be solutions to the einstein equations ?",
    "these lecture notes provide an introduction to the subject of quantum energy inequalities ( qeis ) [ also often called quantum inequalities ( qis ) in the literature ] .",
    "these are conditions derived from within quantum field theory , that constrain the extent to which the classical energy conditions are violated .",
    "they strongly suggest that the answers to the questions just asked are negative ( or raise apparently infeasible engineering problems ) .",
    "the lectures were given at the albert einstein institute , golm ( march 2012 ) as five lectures aimed at graduate students enrolled in the imprs programme .",
    "the secondary aim of the lectures was to provide an introduction to the algebraic formulation of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes and the microlocal analytic techniques that , following their introduction by radzikowski  @xcite , have been important in many recent developments , including the perturbative construction of interacting field theories in curved spacetime  .",
    "from this perspective , the qeis provide a useful application of the theory that illustrates some of its key features . with this in mind , the discussion of qeis is biased towards the derivation and analysis of various bounds , and not to applications such as constraints on exotic spacetime geometries .",
    "the reviews  @xcite provide a counterpoint in that regard .",
    "i would like to thank the organisers of the imprs lectures , particularly stefan fredenhagen , for the invitation and for financial support , the students for their interest and questions , atsushi higuchi and henning bostelmann for useful discussions and tom roman for comments on the text .",

    "the einstein equations @xmath10 are a curious mixture .",
    "einstein himself likened the theory to a building ` one wing of which is built of fine marble ... but the other wing of which is built of low - grade wood ' .",
    "elsewhere , he wrote that ` the right side is a formal condensation of all things whose comprehension in the sense of field - theory is still problematic . '",
    "two observations illustrate some of the ` low grade ' features of the right - hand side .",
    "first , non - gravitational physics only ever considers differences between stress - energy tensors ( or derivatives of stress - energy tensors ) . arguably , the quantity on the right - hand side of the einstein equations [ the absolute stress - energy tensor ] appears nowhere else in physics !",
    "second , without further qualification , the einstein equations have no predictive power whatsoever : _ every _ smooth lorentzian spacetime solves the einstein equations for a suitable choice of @xmath0  a fact that is often exploited in discussions of time - machines , wormholes , warp drives etc . a key issue is to determine what sorts of stress - energy tensors are physically reasonable .",
    "as the real world contains a complicated combination of many different sources of stress - energy , one would ideally like some general principles that should apply fairly widely .",
    "the energy conditions are attempts at such principles .",
    "they are motivated partly by physics , and partly by mathematical expediency .",
    "the main conditions are :    the weak energy condition ( wec ) @xmath11 _ interpretation : all observers see nonnegative energy density . _    the null energy condition ( nec ) @xmath12    the dominant energy condition ( dec ) @xmath13 _ interpretation : all observers see a causal flux of energy - momentum .",
    "_    the strong energy condition ( sec ) @xmath14 for all timelike unit @xmath2 .",
    "if matter satisfies these conditions and the einstein equations hold , we obtain corresponding conditions on the geometry . for example , the nec implies that @xmath15 for all null @xmath2 , while the sec implies the same for all timelike @xmath2 .",
    "the principal interest in these conditions comes from the fact that they enforce various focussing behaviours for congruences of geodesics ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "consider a congruence of timelike geodesics with future - pointing unit tangent field @xmath2 .",

    "we define the smeared wick square by @xmath68 where @xmath69 is any test function on spacetime .",
    "then it is a simple calculation ( recalling our convention for fourier transform ) to show that @xmath70 it is obvious that @xmath71 , and a short calculation gives @xmath72 which is nonzero unless @xmath73 is identically zero .",
    "the observable @xmath74 therefore has vanishing expectation value in the state @xmath63 , but does not annihilate @xmath63 .",
    "standard variational arguments imply that @xmath74 must have some negative spectrum .",
    "indeed , if we write @xmath75 ( assuming @xmath73 is chosen so @xmath76 ) it is easy to calculate @xmath77 giving negative expectation values for sufficiently small @xmath78 , even if @xmath73 is nonnegative . by a scaling argument  @xcite it may be shown that the expectation value of @xmath79 at a point is unbounded from below as the state varies among hadamard states .    the same conclusion may be reached on general grounds .",
    "an argument due to epstein , glaser and jaffe  @xcite proves that loss of positivity is unavoidable for wightman fields with vanishing vacuum expectation values .",
    "the main thrust of their argument is the following .",
    "suppose a local observable @xmath80 has vanishing vacuum expectation value , i.e. , @xmath81",
    ". if @xmath80 is positive , it has a square root , and we have @xmath82 and therefore @xmath83 . hence @xmath84 and , as the reeh ",
    "schlieder theorem  @xcite tells us that no nonzero local observable can annihilate the vacuum , @xmath80 must vanish .",
    "( the reeh  schlieder theorem only applies to local observables , which is why there is no contradiction between the positivity of the hamiltonian and its vanishing v.e.v . )",
    "alternatively , one can argue as follows : individual measurements of @xmath80 in state @xmath63 constitute a random variable with vanishing expectation value ; this implies _ either _ that zero is measured with probability @xmath85 , in which case @xmath84 ( impossible for nonzero local observables by the reeh  schlieder theorem ) _ or _ that there is a nonzero probability for both positive and negative measurement values , so the spectrum of @xmath80 extends into the negative half - line .",
    "there are many physical situations of interest in which negative energy densities arise in qft calculations .",
    "one of the main examples is provided by the casimir effect , in which plane parallel conducting plates _ in vacuo _ experience an attractive force .",
    "actually , quite a bit can be done without much calculation @xcite . in the case of infinite plane plates , separated through distance @xmath86 along the @xmath87-axis in standard",
    "@xmath88 coordinates , one may deduce on symmetry grounds and dimensional considerations that the stress - energy tensor of the electromagnetic field takes the form  @xcite @xmath89 where @xmath90 is dimensionless ; here we have also used tracelessness of the stress - energy tensor .",
    "conservation of the stress - energy tensor entails that @xmath90 is constant except at the plates , so @xmath91 may take different values @xmath92 and @xmath93 inside and outside the plates ( by reflection symmetry the values on the two outer components should be equal ) .",
    "as there is no other length scale in the problem , @xmath93 and @xmath92 must be independent of the plate separation @xmath86 .",
    "now the two limits @xmath94 and @xmath95 can both be regarded as describing a single plate alone in the world ( as far as the outer regions are concerned ) . for the stress - energy tensor outside the plates to behave in the same way in these limits",
    ", we must take @xmath96 .",
    "the inward pressure on each plate is then @xmath97 , so we would deduce @xmath98 from an attractive force .",
    "therefore , the energy density between the plates , @xmath99 , is negative , and we have deduced that wec is violated .",
    "the full computation of the stress - energy tensor in qft leads to the values @xmath96 and @xmath100 , replicating the casimir force formula .",
    "one of the striking features of the casimir result is the small magnitude of the leading coefficient @xmath101 .",
    "indeed , the central message of these lectures is that the energy conditions are in various ways ` almost satisfied ' : violations are either small in magnitude , or short - lived , or when they are not , require disparate scales , highly noninertial motion , or large positive energies somewhere in the system .",
    "indeed , it has been argued that the classical energy conditions might be regarded as holding in an operational sense , once on takes account of the positive energies present in apparatus used to produce and detect negative energy densities  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , it is clear that there is no possibility of insisting on pointwise energy conditions in qft . to gain some insight into what might be possible , it is helpful to note that the energy densities of states formed as superpositions of the vacuum and two - particle states ( like @xmath102 above ) tend to form fringes reminiscent of interference patterns .",
    "an example is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : densityplot ] from which it can be seen that the fringes are spacelike in character ; any timelike observer meets alternating positive and negative values and can not ` surf ' a trough of negative energy density .",

    "for example , if @xmath395 is a complete causal geodesic with affine parameter @xmath718 in a spacetime @xmath175 , and the coupling constant is @xmath719 $ ] then there is a bound @xmath720 for any solution @xmath251 to the nonminimally coupled klein ",
    "gordon equation , with corresponding stress - energy tensor @xmath0 and any @xmath383 .",
    "in particular this result includes the case of conformal coupling .",
    "note that the bound involves the field , but not its derivatives , while the quantity to be bounded involves field and derivatives , including some of second order .",
    "this inequality therefore exhibits the ` gain in derivatives ' phenomenon that occurs in the grding inequalities of pseudodifferential operator theory .",
    "the corresponding quantum theory was discussed in  @xcite for the case of minkowski space .",
    "it was found that the nonminimally coupled field can sustain large negative energy densities for long periods of time .",
    "the argument is the following : the failure of classical wec allows the existence of one - particle states with negative energy density near the origin , say . by a scaling argument these can be taken to have any desired spacetime extent , although the magnitude is correspondingly reduced .",
    "however , we may tensor together as many of these one - particle states as we wish , with respect to which the energy density is additive ( as this is a free theory )",
    ". thus states of arbitrarily negative energy density can be sustained over arbitrarily large spacetime volumes .    however , there is a cost .",
    "the overall energy of these states is positive , and grows more rapidly than the scales characterising the negative energy density effect produced .",
    "so the production of negative energy density is inefficient in this sense . by modifying the qei arguments discussed in these notes",
    ", one can establish qei bounds for the nonminimally coupled field that are state - dependent  @xcite . in these bounds the averaged energy density is bounded below by state - independent terms together with terms that involve averages of the expectation value of the wick square of the field in the state of interest  again demonstrating a ` gain in derivatives ' phenomenon . if one estimates these terms using the hamiltonian operator , it again emerges that the production of sustained negative energy densities only occurs when disproportionately large positive energies are available .",
    "this is still a comparatively new development ; further work , it is hoped , will clarify these issues .",
    "there is now a fairly complete theory of quantum energy inequalities for free fields in globally hyperbolic spacetimes of any dimension ( although optimal bounds are lacking in general ) .",
    "as we have seen , similar results hold in a large class of conformal field theories in two dimensions .",
    "the situation for interacting fields is more complicated , of course , and not so much is known .",
    "the following remarks summarise the state of knowledge :    * one can not expect state - independent qeis to hold ; as mentioned , these can even fail in the nonminimally coupled theory . moreover , on physical grounds , we can expect that long - lasting negative energy densities can be sustained by quantum fields as shown by the example of the casimir effect , modelling the plates as certain states of a full interacting theory .",
    "a computation along these lines was undertaken by olum and graham  @xcite ; although there is a net positive energy density near the ` plates ' , their set - up maintains a negative energy density near the mid - point between them .",
    "however , it is possible that modified qeis hold  see  @xcite for some discussion . * in terms of positive results ,",
    "the averaged null energy condition is known to hold in general two - dimensional quantum field theories  @xcite . in spacetime dimension of @xmath168 or more ,",
    "bostelmann & fewster  @xcite have proved that for a wide class of theories obeying the ` microscopic phase space condition ' there are generally state - dependent qi type results on quantities that are ` classically positive ' , i.e. , arise as the leading term in the ope of a sum of squares .",
    "i originally motivated the energy conditions by reference to the singularity theorems , in which they guarantee certain focussing behaviour .",
    "an important question is whether or not the qei results provide sufficient control to guarantee that quantised matter also obeys singularity theorems .",
    "although this question is far from resolved , fewster & galloway  @xcite have recently shown that the hypotheses of the singularity theorems can be weakened to accommodate bounds motivated by the qeis .",
    "unfortunately there is still a bit of a gap , because hawking - style singularity theorems , concerning congruences of timelike geodesics , require the sec ( for which there is not a state - independent qei ) and penrose - type results involve null geodesic congruences ( which are not suitable for qei bounds ) .",
    "nonetheless , this is encouraging , and one can hope for more progress . for previous results along these lines",
