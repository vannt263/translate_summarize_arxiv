    "the physical properties of stars and galaxies are encoded in their spectral properties .",
    "transcribing observational properties such as colour and spectral line characteristics , into quantities such as stellar mass , velocity dispersion , dust , temperature , density and chemical abundances is a cornerstone of astronomical techniques .",
    "however , access to key diagnostic features is often limited by either atmospheric transmission , instrumental capability ( e.g. limited wavelength coverage ) or detection thresholds . to circumvent these imposed limitations , it is common practice to determine indirect measures of the underlying physical quantities via calibrations with more readily measured quantities .",
    "an excellent example is the determination of the gas phase metallicity in galaxies .",
    "ideally , the metallicity is determined through the measurement of the electron temperature .",
    "this requires detection of emission lines with very different excitation potentials , such as [ oiii ] @xmath1 4363 and [ oiii ] @xmath5 4959 , 5007 , which in turn permits a solution of the electron temperature , density and oxygen abundance ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , the weak strength of the [ oiii ] @xmath1 4363 line means that this ` direct ' technique is only easily applied to relatively metal - poor galaxies .",
    "a large number of indirect metallicity calibrations , which use stronger emission lines , have therefore been proposed ( see @xcite for a review ) , based either on predictions from theoretical models , or calibration from observational data .    whereas the strong line metallicity calibrations are motivated by the detection threshold of a weak spectral feature ,",
    "other calibrations are driven by wavelength coverage .",
    "for example , one of the most common techniques for deriving star formation rate ( sfr ) in local galaxies is via the luminosity of h@xmath0 ( e.g. @xcite ) . at @xmath6",
    "this line shifts out of the optical window , motivating calibration against bluer lines such as [ oii ] @xmath13727 ( e.g. @xcite ) . at a similar redshift ,",
    "the [ nii]@xmath16584 line is also lost from the optical window .",
    "[ nii ] @xmath1 6584 is used in a number of diagnostics , including some metallicity calibrations ( e.g. @xcite ) and the very widely used active galactic nucleus ( agn ) classification technique of @xcite , or the ` bpt ' technique .",
    "alternative agn classification schemes that can be applied to @xmath6 galaxies use a combination of bluer emission lines , the 4000   break ( d@xmath7 ) , colour and mass ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for example , in the absence of near - infrared spectroscopy , @xcite show that combining [",
    "oiii]@xmath1 5007/h@xmath4 and stellar mass successfully distinguishes between star formation and agn emission .",
    "although the application of calibrated metallicities , sfrs and agn classification is straight - forward and has proven a tremendously useful tool in the study of galactic properties , each diagnostic is designed for a single purpose prediction . in this paper , we investigate the use of artificial neural networks ( anns ) for predicting the raw line luminosities of h@xmath0 and [ nii]@xmath16584 , quantities which can then be applied in the user s choice of calibration .",
    "moreover , the line luminosities themselves contain information about physical conditions within the galaxy such as ionization parameter and dust extinction @xcite , which can be determined from the ann predicted luminosities .",
    "the artificial neural network is a non - linear method that ` learns ' from training sets of data to predict the properties of other samples .",
    "there has been an increasing interest in using anns in astronomy ; recent applications include star - galaxy discrimination and galaxy classification @xcite .",
    "essentially any problem that is based on pattern recognition or correlations can be tackled with anns .",
    "the potential downside is that the ann machinery is complex and requires significant overhead to construct and train .",
    "this is in contrast with many of the calibration approaches described above that provide simple analytic formulae to predict physical quantities based on linear correlations .    in this paper",
    ", we aim to combine the power of the artificial neural network with the user - friendliness of an analytic solution in order to provide ann - calibrated equations that predict the luminosities of h@xmath0 and [ nii]@xmath1 6584 .",
    "the paper is presented as follows . in section [ ann_sec ]",
    "we describe the basics of regression techniques , including their mathematical foundations and the specific cases of the ann and basis function regression .",
    "section [ balmer_sec ] presents a simple case study of how the ann can be applied to spectral data .",
    "the balmer decrement ( h@xmath0/h@xmath4 ) of star - forming galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) is predicted and compared to the recently published linear calibration of @xcite .",
    "readers who are solely interested in the prediction of h@xmath0 and [ nii]@xmath16584 luminosities may wish to skip directly to sections [ sf_sec ] and [ mixed_sec ] where we present the ann calibrations for star - forming galaxies and emission line galaxies of unknown classification respectively . in section [ fx_sec ]",
    "we describe the widely applicable polynomial and matrix - based forms of our ann outputs .",
    "the robustness of the calibrations in tested in section [ test_sec ] , and the application to gas - phase metallicities and agn classification are demonstrated in section [ app_sec ] .    throughout the paper",
    "we assume a cosmology with @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10= 1.0 , 0.3 , 0.7 and h@xmath11 = 70 km s@xmath12 mpc@xmath12 .",
    "line fluxes ( corrected for galactic extinction and underlying stellar continuum ) , stellar masses , equivalent widths and other galactic parameters are taken from the mpa / jhu catalogs ( unless otherwise noted ) , with errors scaled accordingly .",
    "the modelling of data is a mathematical problem that is fundamental in the scientific method .",
    "linear models are not always sufficient to describe physical phenomena , so that non - linear representations may be required to find more complicated relations between different parameters in a given data set . in particular , when there is insufficient information on the nature of the data under study , or the function describing the connection between the parameters of the data is not known _ a priori _ , non - linear methods are particularly powerful ,    in general , regression methods deal with a function in the following form :    @xmath13    for a defined function with known input vectors * x@xmath14 * the aim is to find parameters * a@xmath14 * in order to retrieve the target vector * tar*. when the analytic form of @xmath15 is not explicitly known , then linear or non - linear representations of the function must be derived in order to identify the optimal form . in this",
    "regard , non - linear functions may be preferable , since they can solve more complicated problems . selecting a special form for the function ( and optimizing the values of * a@xmath14 * )",
    "is referred to as a regression method . amongst regression methods , artificial neural networks and basis function regression ( bfr )",
    "are two of the most commonly used .",
    "anns are widely used in a large variety of applications in various disciplines .",
    "a neural network is , in essence , an attempt to simulate the brain .",
    "it is a mathematical model that tries to simulate the functionalities of biological neural networks .",
    "its basic building block is a simple mathematical model . a neural network is a computing system made up of a number highly interconnected processing elements that are called neurons .",
    "an ann contains three layers : input , hidden and output , where each layer has a different number of neurons .",
    "the input layer and output layers are connected to the input and target data , respectively .",
    "the hidden layer connects these two layers in a more complicated way . in this way ,",
    "all possible combinations of the input and the target data can be considered . choosing the number of neurons depends on the nature of the problem under study . using this model , each input datum",
    "is weighted and then added up with a bias , * b * , to make a desired target , * tar * , by an activation function , @xmath15 .",
    "a non - linear activation function introduces non - linearity into the network , which usually is selected as a sigmoid function ( e.g. , see vanzella et al 2004 ) . in vector form",
    "we have the following relationship :    @xmath16    a network can contain several layers with different @xmath15 , * w * and * b*. the output of each layer can be considered as the input of the next layer . in this way , each element of the input vector * x@xmath17 * ( the input training data set ) is connected to each neuron input through the weight matrices * w*. a network can be trained using supervised or unsupervised methods ( @xcite ) . in a supervised mode , for example , @xcite use the magnitudes of galaxies using the hdf - s and sdss data as input data , * x@xmath17 * , to train a network using the redshift information of the galaxies as target values , * tar*.    briefly , after collecting the data ( i.e. , * tar * and * x@xmath17 * ) a network is created and then configured .",
    "configuration is the step in which the network is arranged to be compatible with the problem under study ( e.g. , a fitting or a classification problem ) .",
    "initialization of the ann parameters ( weights and biases ) and training the network ( finding suitable weights and biases ) are the next steps .",
    "the latter can be done using one of several algorithms .",
    "for example , in a gradient descent algorithm , and in an iterative way , the aim may be to improve ( or upgrade ) weights and biases in the direction where a performance function ( e.g. , a mean square error function ) decreases most rapidly ( i.e. , in the direction of negative gradient ) .",
    "if the @xmath18 are the current weights and biases and @xmath19 is the current gradient then the algorithm may be written as :    @xmath20    where @xmath0 is a learning rate that is an adjustable parameter .",
    "@xmath0 controls the size of the weight and bias changes during the learning process .",
    "we use the levenberg - marquardt optimization method ( marquardt et al .",
    "1963 ) to update weight and bias values . finally , after the validation of a network",
    ", it will be ready to use ( or test ) for new data . in the validation step ,",
    "the trained network ( i.e. , the network with defined weights and biases ) is generally tested on an independent dataset , * x@xmath21 * , set to verify the network s performance is robust .",
    "@xmath22    if the output of a network , * out@xmath21 * , is close to the actual values then this means that the network is well trained .",
    "generally , this also shows that there has been a good correlation between * x@xmath17 * and * tar*. in some cases , we wish to parameterize the mapping from d - dimensional inputs to the desired output . in other words",
    ", we have multi - dimensional inputs and a known output .",
    "the question of which input data - set ( from @xmath23 available input vectors ) make this correlation the strongest is an important issue .",
    "specifically , in this work , we will consider which combinations of strong emission lines , and stellar mass , can be best combined to give a reliable prediction of the h@xmath0 and [ nii ] line luminosities .    in equation [ weight - tr ]",
    ", the input data generally contain different pieces of physical information :    @xmath24    in other words , * x@xmath17 * can be a matrix containing @xmath23 ( column ) vectors .",
    "for example , it can comprise the information of colour ( as vector @xmath25 as well as information of equivalent width ( ew ) of a certain emission line ( @xmath26 ) of a data set of @xmath27 galaxies .",
    "again , to give a concrete example , groves et al .",
    "( 2012 ) show that the balmer decrement ( @xmath28 ) can be measured from the emission line ews and colours .",
    "therefore , in a neural network approach , @xmath29 and @xmath30 can be considered as ews and colours , respectively .      in regression problems , models have the same basic form of @xmath31 in which y and x are target and independent input data , respectively . in principle",
    ", @xmath15 can have any form . in any selected form , coefficients @xmath32",
    "should be found according to a minimization algorithm . in a basis function regression",
    "we can select a polynomial function in which @xmath33 can , for example , be a second or third order polynomial function . in order to provide a user - friendly method for the application of the ann predictions",
    ", we will present the polynomial functions that best encapsulate the networks predictions . to this end",
    ", we use a second order polynomial function and a levenberg - marquardt algorithm to fit the data . if * x * is an n - dimensional column vector",
    ", then we can write a quadratic function in a general form as :    @xmath34    equivalently , in matrix form we have : @xmath35 .",
    "n is the number of physical parameters used as input data and c@xmath36 is a symmetric matrix .",
    "for example , for a certain run which utilizes three physical parameters such as x@xmath37=mass , x@xmath38=oiii and x@xmath39h@xmath4 , n=3 and there is a total of 10 independent coefficients to be determined . by this equation",
    ", we consider different connections between the physical parameters in a more complicated form .",
    "we will give an example of using this equation in the next section .",
    "in order to demonstrate the application of the ann to spectral data , and to test its performance against the analytic calibrations , we apply the ann technique to the prediction of the balmer decrement ( h@xmath0/h@xmath4 ) . since the ann predicts the line luminosities that we would expect to measure in the observed spectrum , the predicted h@xmath0 luminosity can be combined with the observed h@xmath4 luminosity to determine the amount of dust extinction ( see below ) .",
    "the determination of extinction is a critical component of spectral analysis since , once determined , a correction can be applied to other line fluxes .",
    "the performance of the ann can be compared directly to the analytic prediction of the balmer decrement presented by @xcite .",
    "a major component of the work presented here is the translation of the ann solutions into polynomial equations that can be simply applied by any user .",
    "we therefore also present and test a second order polynomial basis function that is based on the ann , i.e. , eq .",
    "[ eq - basis - function ] , to find the associated coefficients that can be used to predict h@xmath0/h@xmath4 for a given set of input .    under the assumption of either an optically thin or thick medium , and the temperature of the region ,",
    "it is possible to predict the intrinsic ratio of the balmer emission line series ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the observed ratio of fluxes can therefore be combined with predictions from extinction laws ( e.g. @xcite ) to derive the attenuation through a particular region .",
    "as described in detail by @xcite , the accurate measurement of h@xmath0 and h@xmath4 line fluxes requires sufficiently high s / n and resolution to be able to account for underlying absorption in the stellar continuum .",
    "equivalent widths , however , are relatively easy to measure , but do not account for the required absorption corrections .",
    "for this reason , some studies ( e.g. @xcite ) have proposed the use of ews instead of fluxes , with a fixed correction for underlying stellar absorption .",
    "a more sophisticated approach is proposed by @xcite .",
    "based on a calibration of h@xmath0 and h@xmath4 ews , continuum - corrected fluxes and colours , @xcite provide a calibration between ews and the balmer decrement that statistically accounts for the stellar absorption .",
    "based on a sample of emission line ( star - forming and agn dominated ) galaxies in the sdss , the analysis of groves et al .",
    "( 2012 ) determines the balmer decrement by first quantifying an absorption correction factor to the h@xmath0 and h@xmath4 ews , and then uses the rest - frame fibre @xmath40 colour as a proxy for the stellar continuum .",
    "groves et al .",
    "( 2012 ) hence determine the following prediction of the balmer decrement ( where ews are in  ) :    @xmath41+[a_3(g - r)+a_4 ] .",

    "@xcite use a constant balmer absorption correction for both ew(h@xmath0 ) and ew(h@xmath4 ) . in this case a correction factor , which depends also on the ew range of the sample , is derived .",
    "the correction factor is determined from minimizing the offset between the sdss galaxies ew balmer decrements and the measured h@xmath0/h@xmath4 ( with an error - based weighting scheme , as described in @xcite .    here",

    "in this section we test the robustness of the ann calibration in three ways .",
    "first , we investigate the importance of the selected parameters used in ann and the size and sampling of the training set .",
    "second , we examine whether the scatter in predicted line luminosities depends on the physical parameters ( such as mass and metallicity ) of the sample . finally , we test whether the calibrations derived for the sdss data work well when applied to an independent dataset .",
    "a first consideration in the ann application is the number of neurons used .",
    "for example , using a large number of the neurons in a network can increase its power , but it can also result in over - fitting . to prevent this ,",
    "the networks parameters can be tuned in such a way that the training and validation sets show the same scatter . in the work presented here , we find that 8 - 10 neurons works well with our dataset .",
    "we also check several optimization algorithms and find that the levenberg - marquardt and bayesian regulation back propagation provide the same results as one other , and are superior to other optimization algorithms such as a gradient descent back propagation .",
    "the ann will only work well if the training set is a good representation of the data for which the prediction is desired .",
    "the scatter in the training and validation sets also depends on the size of the training set . as mentioned previously , we repeat each run 20 times , with different initialization . for higher numbers of galaxies selected for training ann",
    "the outputs of each run cover the same range .",
    "in other words , here , there is a stability .",
    "when we reduce the number of galaxies for training the output of the runs are in significantly different ranges .",
    "we find that a training sample of @xmath62 galaxies can predict an acceptable result in which the behavior of the training and validation sets are the same .      in figures [ fig - delta - sf ] and [ fig - delta - mix ]",
    "we test the performance of the ann as a function of various physical and observational parameters , for star - forming and mixed galaxies , respectively . in each figure",
    "we calculate the offset of the line luminosity predictions ( of either h@xmath0 or [ nii ] ) relative to the observed luminosities as    @xmath63    the blue lines in figures [ fig - delta - sf ] and [ fig - delta - mix ] show the offsets for h@xmath0 and the red lines show offsets for [ nii ] . in all panels of these two figures ,",
    "we adopt the results of run r8 with a s / n@xmath535 for demonstration purposes , although our conclusions do not depend on the choice of run .    for star - forming galaxies ,",
    "we investigate in figure [ fig - delta - sf ] , the difference in the predicted and observed line luminosities as a function of total stellar mass , @xmath56-band covering fraction ( cf ) , metallicity and sfr .",
    "the @xmath56-band covering fraction is simply the fraction of light in the sdss @xmath56-band that is included by the fibre , and is computed from the combination of total and fibre magnitudes .    from figure [ fig - delta - sf ]",
    "it can be seen that there is no systematic offset of @xmath64 from zero as a function of total stellar mass or sfr for either h@xmath0 or [ nii ] .",
    "the results are also equally robust to changes in the covering fraction , indicating that the calibrations provided in this paper may be applied to galaxies with a range of masses and obtained with a variety of apertures .",
    "nonetheless , there is an extremely mild trend ( although statistically insignificant ) of @xmath64 [ nii ] with covering fraction , such that the ann slightly over - predicts the luminosity at large covering fractions , and slightly under - predicts the luminosity at the smallest apertures .",

    "the predicted line luminosities of h@xmath0 ( upper panel ) and [ nii ] ( lower panel ) obtained from eq . [ eq - basis - function ] , f(x ) , are shown in the right hand panels of figure [ fig - gama - hn ] . for a comparison ,",

    "this kind of offset is not seen in the validation and training sets for either the ann method nor for the f(x ) method .",
    "it is likely that the high scatter is due ( at least in part ) to the different methods and accuracies of calibration , data processing and stellar mass determination .",
    "for example , the gama data show a higher mean value for the two input emission lines and an average 0.25 dex difference in the stellar masses . despite these differences , and the differences that are likely inherent to other datasets , figure",
    "[ fig - gama - hn ] demonstrates that the methods presented here yield generally very good line luminosity predictions .",

    "having tested the robustness of the ann method , in this final section , we provide two example applications of the line luminosity predictions .",
    "the bpt diagram is an important tool for distinguishing agn and sf galaxies from each other . to demonstrate the application of our method ( which we have shown works well for both star - forming and agn dominated galaxies ) in this regard , we compare the [ nii ] and h@xmath68 of the observed ( original ) data with those that are predicted by our method and construct two bpt diagrams .",
    "the top panel of figure [ fig - bpt ] shows a bpt diagram that is constructed for run 8 for the mixed sample .",

    "@xcite investigate the sdss mass - metallicity relation with 10 different metallicity calibrations , encompassing those based on both theoretical and empirical methods .",
    "several of these methods are variants on the r@xmath75 method , requiring [ oii ] @xmath1 3727 , [ oiii ] @xmath1 4959 , [ oiii@xmath76 \\lambda$ ] 5007 and h@xmath4 ( e.g. , @xcite , kk04 ) .",
    "r@xmath75 diagnostics have the advantage of requiring only 3 emission lines @xmath15007 , the stronger member of the doublet , is needed , as the total [ oiii ] flux can be obtained by scaling . ] spanning a relatively narrow wavelength range .",
    "the well - known principal disadvantage of r@xmath75 calibrations is the need to break the degeneracy between upper and lower branches .",
    "[ nii ] is frequently used to achieve this ( e.g. kewley & ellison 2008 ) , so one application of the line predictions presented in this work is to break this degeneracy .",
    "a second metallicity application of the predictions presented herein involves conversions between metallicity indicators . as demonstrated by kewley & ellison ( 2008 )",
    ", the factor of five spread in metallicity between calibrations may hinder the combination of different datasets .",
    "kewley & ellison therefore derive polynomial fits between metallicities derived from different calibrations , which can be used to convert between diagnostics .",
    "however , an alternative to converting via the kewley & ellison polynomials , is to predict the additional line fluxes needed to calculate the metallicity in the desired diagnostic .    as an example",
    ", we consider the case where we would like to convert an r@xmath75 based calibration to one which uses [ nii ] and h@xmath0 , ( e.g. , @xcite , pp04 ) .",
    "we use run 10 in this demonstration , since it combines the emission lines used in the basic r@xmath75 diagnostic .",
    "we will consider the pp04 metallicity as our ` target ' metallicity , but imagine the case where only [ oii ] @xmath1 3727 , [ oiii ] @xmath1 4959 , [ oiii@xmath76 \\lambda$ ] 5007 and h@xmath4 are observed .",
    "we begin by adopting the predictive approach described in this paper , namely we predict the [ nii ] and h@xmath0 luminosities using the polynomial functions described in section [ fx_sec ] for run 10 , and can hence calculate pp04 metallicities .",
    "it is of course possible to calculate real pp04 metallicities for our sample , since the sdss data have measured values of [ nii ] and h@xmath0 .",
    "we can hence compare the pp04 metallicities measured in the data , with that based on predicted [ nii ] and h@xmath0 line luminosities .",
    "the right panel of figure [ fig - metal ] compares the predicted and measured pp04 metallicities .",
    "clearly , the agreement is excellent , with small scatter ( 0.017 dex ) and very few outliers .",
    "alternatively , we can repeat our experiment that begins with the observed [ oii ] @xmath1 3727 , [ oiii ] @xmath1 4959 , [ oiii@xmath76 \\lambda$ ] 5007 and h@xmath4 , and first calculate an r@xmath75 metallicity .",
    "we adopt the kk04 calibration for this test .",
    "we can then use the conversion in kewley & ellison ( 2008 ) to determine the equivalent pp04 metallicity .",
    "the result is shown in the left panel of figure [ fig - metal ] .",
    "the horizontal axis is the same as the right panel , namely the pp04 metallicity that can be determined directly from the data .",
    "the vertical axis is now the metallicity of pp04 that has been converted from kk04 .",
    "although the overall correlation is good , the scatter is larger ( 0.063 dex ) and there are some cases ( albeit a minority ) where the conversion fails ( see the region of converted metallicities of log o / h + 12 @xmath57 8.2 ) . whilst the conversions of kewley & ellison ( 2008 ) are still advantageous in cases where line fluxes are not provided ( i.e. only metallicities are quoted ) , the more complex relations encapsulated by the ann - based calibrations offer an alternative route to robust metallicity conversions .",
    "diagnostic plus the conversion given in kewley & ellison ( 2008 ) .",
    "the right panel shows the case in which the pp04 metallicity is obtained using run 10 and the polynomial - based prediction of [ nii ] and h@xmath0 .",
    "the ann - based approach yields a much tighter relation with the directly measured metallicities.,width=325,height=158 ]",
    "artificial neural networks ( anns ) can be used to predict spectral line luminosities that are useful for a variety of applications . after an overview of formalism of the ann , we present a simple case study for the prediction of the balmer decrement ( h@xmath0/h@xmath4 ) which is compared to the analytic prediction of groves et al .",
    "since the ann predicts the expected observed ( rather than intrinsic ) line luminosity , our prediction of h@xmath0 can be combined with the actual observed h@xmath4 in order to determine the galaxy s internal extinction .",
    "we show that using the same input data , we can decrease the scatter in the predictions of the decrement from 0.058 ( groves et al .",
    "2012 ) to 0.038 dex ( ann ) .",
    "we then present an application of artificial neural networks to the prediction of h@xmath0 and [ nii ] @xmath1 6584 luminosities in galaxy spectra .",
    "the ann is trained on large samples ( many tens of thousands ) of galaxies from the sdss , and tested for biases in training sample size , galaxy properties and aperture covering fraction .",
    "twelve runs with different input parameters are tested , representing varying combinations of stellar masses and strong emission lines .",
    "many of the runs can predict line luminosities with scatters @xmath59 0.1 dex , regardless of whether the galaxy is star - forming or has an agn and whether total or fibre stellar mass is used .",
    "these results indicate that the ann is a robust tool for predicting the line luminosity of h@xmath0 and [ nii ] in low redshift galaxies . indeed , testing on an independent dataset ( gama ) yields scatter in the line luminosities only @xmath57 0.05 dex larger than the sdss data set , likely due to different calibration / reduction procedures .    in order to demonstrate potential applications of our method",
    ", we investigate the measurement of gas - phase metallicities and agn classification .",
    "the ann yields a considerable improvement in the prediction of gas - phase metallicities from diagnostics that require the [ nii ] and h@xmath0 lines , compared to the empirically determined conversions of kewley & ellison ( 2008 ) and an agn classification is successful in 86 per cent of sdss galaxies .    in order to make the ann results useful to the general community , we have derived polynomial basis function coefficients in a condensed matrix form that accurately reproduces the ann results .",
