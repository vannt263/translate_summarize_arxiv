    "during helium - burning and , perhaps , carbon - burning phases in massive and intermediate mass stars , the @xmath0ne(@xmath1,_n_)@xmath2 mg reaction is thought to be the neutron source driving the synthesis of nuclides in the a@xmath860 - 90 mass range during the slow - neutron - capture ( _ s _ ) process @xcite .",
    "process in these stars also can modify the abundances of several lighter nuclides .",
    "the @xmath0ne(@xmath1,_n_)@xmath2 mg reaction also acts as a secondary neutron source during the _ s _ process in low - mass asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars during which roughly half the abundances of nuclides in the a@xmath990 - 209 range are thought to be synthesized @xcite .",
    "although the overall neutron exposure due to this reaction in agb stars is much smaller than that due to @xmath10c(@xmath1,_n_)@xmath11o , the neutron density as well as the temperature are much higher during the @xmath0ne(@xmath7,_n_)@xmath2 mg phase , resulting in important modifications to the final _ s_-process abundances .",
    "massive stars during their later burning stages are also the leading candidates for the production of the rare neutron - deficient isotopes of nuclides in the a@xmath1290 mass range through the so - called _ p _ process . because the _ s _ process in these stars produces seed nuclides for a later _ p _ process , the size of the @xmath0ne(@xmath1,_n_)@xmath2 mg reaction rate used in the stellar model can have a significant effect on the predicted abundances of the _ p _ isotopes @xcite .",
    "there have been several attempts to determine the rate for this reaction either through direct @xmath0ne(@xmath1,_n_)@xmath2 mg measurements @xcite or indirectly via @xmath3mg(@xmath6,_n_)@xmath2 mg @xcite or charged - particle transfer reactions gi93 .",
    "however , direct measurements have suffered from relatively poor resolution as well as the fact that the cross section is extremely small at the lower energies corresponding to _ s_-process temperatures .",
    "indirect methods have also suffered from limited sensitivity and relatively poor resolution .",
    "this rate , in principle , could be determined via the inverse @xmath2mg(_n_,@xmath1)@xmath0ne reaction , but the small size of the cross section in the relevant energy range makes these measurements exceedingly difficult , so no results have been reported . as a result ,",
    "various evaluations @xcite of this rate show considerable differences and all but the most recent @xcite recommend uncertainties much larger than needed to adequately constrain astrophysical models . because the lowest observed resonance ( _ _ e__@xmath13=832 kev , which corresponds to _ _ e__@xmath14=235 kev in the inverse reaction ) in direct @xmath0ne(@xmath1,_n_)@xmath2 mg measurements is considerably above the most important energy range for _ s_-process temperatures , the uncertainty in this rate is dominated by the poorly known properties of states in @xmath3 mg between this resonance and threshold .",
    "because both @xmath0ne and @xmath15he have @xmath16=0@xmath17 , only natural parity ( 0@xmath17 , 1@xmath18 , 2@xmath17 .. ) states in @xmath3 mg can participate in the @xmath0ne(@xmath1,_n_)@xmath2 mg reaction , so only a subset of @xmath19 mg states in the relevant energy range observed via neutron reactions can contribute to the reaction rate .",
    "most evaluations have made the assumption that either all , or only one , of the known states @xcite in this region can contribute to the reaction rate .",
    "for example , in the recent nacre @xcite evaluation , all known states in this region were considered when calculating the uncertainty whereas in the most recent report @xcite only one state was assumed to have natural parity . as a result , the recommended uncertainties in the nacre evaluation are much larger than those in ref . @xcite .",
    "for example , at @xmath20=0.2 gk , the nacre uncertainty is approximately 300 times larger than that given in ref . @xcite .",
    "much of the information about states in @xmath3 mg in the relevant energy region comes from neutron measurements @xcite . in principle",
    ", the combination of neutron total and capture cross section measurements on @xmath21 mg can determine all of the relevant resonance parameters ( _ _ e__@xmath22 , @xmath16 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 ) except @xmath25 with much better sensitivity and to greater precision than other techniques .",
    "both high - resolution @xmath26mg+_n _ total and @xmath21mg(_n_,@xmath6)@xmath3 mg cross sections have been reported @xcite and some resonance parameters were extracted from these data . however , the resonance analysis was rather limited and it is possible to extract much more information using current techniques .",
    "for example , resonance shapes and peak heights in the total cross section should allow the extraction of _",
    "_ j__@xmath27 values , but no definite assignments were made in ref .",
    "@xcite for states in @xmath3 mg .",
    "also , it should be possible to determine the partial widths for many of the resonances , but only five @xmath23 and no @xmath28 values were reported for the 17 @xmath2mg+_n _ resonances reported in ref .",
    "partial width information can be particularly valuable in assessing the relative strengths of the competing @xmath0ne(@xmath1,_n_)@xmath2 mg and @xmath29ne(@xmath1,@xmath6)@xmath3 mg reactions in stars , and hence the efficiency of the _",

    "i describe the data and analysis technique used . in section [ compsec",
    "] , i compare the new results to previous analyses of neutron data as well as resonance parameter information from @xmath0ne(@xmath1,_n_)@xmath2 mg , @xmath3mg(@xmath6,_n_)@xmath2 mg , and @xmath0ne(@xmath31li,_d_)@xmath3 mg measurements . in section [ reacrate ] , i use the new resonance parameters together with recently reported @xcite upper limits for the @xmath0ne(@xmath1,_n_)@xmath2 mg cross section to compute the uncertainty in this rate at _",

    "i conclude that the most recent report @xcite of this reaction rate has underestimated the uncertainty by at least a factor of 10 and that high resolution @xmath2mg+_n _ total cross section measurements would be invaluable in further refining the uncertainty in this important reaction rate .",
    "the best data for the present purposes are those of ref .",
    "the data consist of very high resolution @xmath26mg+_n _ total and high - resolution @xmath2mg(_n_,@xmath6)@xmath3 mg cross sections measured using time - of - flight techniques at the white neutron source of the oak ridge electron linear accelerator ( orela ) facility @xcite .",

    "yield a reaction rate approximately twice as large as the `` high '' rate of ref .",

    "although it is questionable that the energy of this state so uncertain , the results of the present work should make it clear that energies resulting from analysis of the neutron data are so precise that this source of uncertainty now is practically eliminated .",

    "the new @xmath2mg+_n _ parameter set represents a substantial improvement over previous work .",

    "the @xmath30-matrix analysis of the present work revealed that of the 16 states observed , there are at least two , and very likely three , other definite natural parity states in @xmath19 mg in this energy range and two definite non - natural parity states . the parameters for these natural parity states , together with yield limits from a recent @xmath0ne(@xmath1,_n_)@xmath2 mg measurement ja2001 have been used to estimate the contributions of these states to this reaction rate . in a recent report @xcite , only one of these states ( @xmath64=636 kev ) was considered , and it was concluded that the uncertainty in the reaction rate was much less than previously estimated . however , using the upper limit on the resonance strength of the possible @xmath61=636-kev resonance reported in this reference , i calculate that they have underestimated the uncertainty due to this resonance alone by a factor of two .",
    "more importantly , the definite natural parity resonance at @xmath54=19.880 kev , which corresponds to a possible @xmath0ne(@xmath1,_n_)@xmath2 mg resonance at @xmath64=588 kev , contributes a ten times larger uncertainty to the rate at _ s_-process temperatures .",

    "it may be that neutron elastic scattering measurements would also be needed in the more difficult cases .",
