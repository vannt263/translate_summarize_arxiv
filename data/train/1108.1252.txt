    "the emission from narrow - line region ( nlr ) of active galactic nucleus ( agn ) is an important tool to study the relation between the activity of the central supermassive black hole ( smbh ) and the growth of its host galaxy in which the smbh resides , both because the nlr emission is mainly resulted from the illumination by the central agn and because the nlr kinematics is believed to be mainly dominated by the gravity of the bulge ( see review in wilson & heckman 1985 and references therein , whittle 1992a , b ; nelson & white 1996 ) . the gravity dominated kinematics motivates a number of previous studies to demonstrate that the line width of the agn s strong [ ] @xmath15007 emission line can be used as a proxy for the stellar velocity dispersion of the bugle ( e.g. , nelson & white 1996 ; nelson 2000 ; boroson 2003 ; komossa & xu 2007 ) . basing upon the tight @xmath2 relationship ( e.g. , tremaine et al . 2002 ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ; haring & rix 2004 ) , the proxy therefore allows one to easily estimate @xmath3 in a large sample of agns ( e.g. , grupe & mathur 2004 ; wang & lu 2001 ; komossa & xu 2007 ) .",
    "it is well known for a long time that the line profiles of the [ ] doublelets show a blue asymmetry with an extended blue wing and a sharp red falloff in a large fraction of agns ( e.g. , heckman et al .",

    "the blue asymmetry requires a narrow core gaussian profile ( @xmath4 ) with a blueshifted , broad gaussian component ( @xmath5 ) to reproduce the observed asymmetric profiles for both [ ] @xmath6 emission lines .",
    "the spectroscopic monitor revealed a variability time scale from one to ten years for the blue wings of the [ ] @xmath0 lines in two type i agns ( izw1 : wang et al . 2005 ; ngc5548 : sergeev et al .",
    "1997 ) , which means that the blue wings are likely emitted from the intermediate - line region located between the traditional blr and nlr .",
    "in addition to the blue asymmetry , the redshifts of the [ ] doublelets are often found to be negative compared to the redshifts measured from both stellar absorption features and h@xmath7 emission line ( i.e. , [ ] blueshifts , e.g. , phillips 1976 ; zamanov et al .2002 ; marziani et al .",

    "although they are rare cases , the objects with strong [ ] blueshifts larger than 100@xmath8 are called `` blue outliers '' .",
    "the popular explanation of the observed [ ] emission - line profile is that the material outflow from central agn plays important role in reproducing the observed blue asymmetry and blueshift . with",
    "the advent of the high spatial resolution of hubble space telescope ( hst ) , spatially resolved spectroscopic observations of a few nearby seyfert 2 galaxies indicate that the nlrs show complicate kinematics , which could reproduce the observed [ ] line profiles by the radial outflow acceleration ( or deceleration ) and/or jet expansion ( e.g. , crenshaw et al .",

    "recent systematical studies suggested that the blue asymmetry is related with the activity of the central smbh .",
    "veron - cetty et al . (",
    "2001 ) indicated that half of their sample of narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ) shows a broad and blueshifted [ ] @xmath15007 component in addition to the unshifted narrow core component .",
    "nelson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) found a correlation between the blue asymmetry and eigenvector - i space by studying the [ ] @xmath15007 line profiles of the pg quasars .",
    "the quasars associated with larger blue asymmetries tend to be stronger emitters presumably having larger eddington ratios ( @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the eddington luminosity , see also in xu et al . 2007 ; boroson 2005 ; greene & ho 2005 ; mathur & grupe 2005 ) .",
    "similar as the blue asymmetry , the [ ] blueshift is also found to be related with a number of agn properties .",
    "some authors claimed that the [ ] blueshift is directly correlated with @xmath9 ( e.g. , boroson 2005 ; bian et al .",
    "2005 ) , although the correlation might not be the truth ( e.g. , aoki et al .",
    "marziani et al .",
    "( 2003 ) pointed out that all the `` blue outliers '' have small h@xmath7 line widths ( @xmath11 ) and high @xmath9 ( see also in zamanov et al .",
    "2002 ; komossa et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "agns are now widely believed to co - evolve with their host galaxies , which is implied by the tight @xmath2 correlation ( see the citations in the first paragraph ) and by the global evolutionary history of the growth of the central smbh that traces the star formation history closely from present to @xmath12 ( e.g. , nandra et al .",

    "2008 ; shankar et al . 2009 ; hasinger et al . 2005 ) .",
    "a number of studies recently provided direct evidence supporting the co - evolutionary scenario in which an agn evolves along the eigenvector - i space from a high @xmath9 state to a low @xmath9 state as the circumnuclear stellar population continually ages ( e.g. , wang et al .",

    "the results of theoretical simulations indicate a possibility that a major merger between two gas - rich disk galaxies plays important role in the co - evolution of agns and their host galaxies ( e.g. , di matteo et al . 2007 ; hopkins et al . 2007 ;",
    "granato et al .",

    "2009 ; hopkins et al . 2005 ; davis et al . 2007 ; wild et al . 2010 ) .",
    "the delay might be resulted from the feedback from either the central agn ( e.g. , hopkins et al .",
    "2005 ) or the stellar winds ( e.g. , morman & scoville 1988 ) , and/or resulted from the purely dynamical origin ( hopkins 2011 ) .",
    "the outflow origin for both blue asymmetry and blueshift naturally gives us the hint that the [ ] emission - line profile ( and the inferred nlr kinematics ) co - evolves with the stellar population of the host galaxy .",
    "we here report a study that is an effort to examine the evolution of the [ ] @xmath15007 emission - line profile . in principle , both broad- and narrow - line agns are needed to be analyzed to give a complete study . although the [ ] line profiles can be easily measured in the spectra of typical type i agns , the host galaxy properties are hard to be determined because of the strong contamination from the central agn s continuum . since our aim is to study the relationship between the line profile and the host galaxy properties , the narrow emission - line galaxies from sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) are adopted in our study because their spectra allow us to simultaneously measure both [ ] @xmath15007 line profile and stellar population properties in individual object .",
    "the high - order dimensionless line shape parameters are adopted by us to describe the line profile in details .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the sample selection is presented in  2 .",

    "b , c ; tremonti et al .",
    "2004 ; see heckman & kauffmann 2006 for a review ) , the catalog provides the measured spectral and physical properties of 927,555 individual narrow emission - line galaxies , including seyfert galaxies , liners , transition galaxies and star - forming galaxies .",
    "the integrated spectra of the narrow emission - line galaxies allow us to study the relationship between the [ ] @xmath15007 emission - line profiles and the circumnuclear stellar populations , because their continuum is dominated by the starlight components .    at first",
    ", we select the galaxies whose spectra have median signal - to - noise ratio per pixel of the whole spectrum s / n@xmath1820 from the mpa / jhu sdss dr7 catalog to ensure that the stellar features could be properly separated from each observed spectrum .",
    "secondly , all the emission lines used in the traditional three baldwin - phillips - terlevich ( bpt ) diagnostic diagrams are required to be detected with a significant level at least 3@xmath19 .",
    "thirdly , the spectral profiles of the [ ] @xmath15007 emission lines are only measured for the galaxies whose [ ] lines have s / n larger than 30 .",
    "finally , the galaxies with redshifts within the range from 0.11 to 0.12 are removed in the subsequent spectral analysis .",
    "the removement is used to avoid the possible fake spectral profile caused by the poorly subtracted strong sky emission line [ ] @xmath15577 at the observer frame .",
    "after the selection based on the mpa / jhu catalog , we remove all the galaxies whose [ ] line widths are smaller than @xmath20 from our subsequent statistical comparisons according to our spectral profile measurements ( see section 3 for details ) . the mean intrinsic resolution used in the above criterion",
    "is adopted to be 65@xmath8 according to the sdss pipelines measurements ( e.g. , york et al . 2000 ) .",
    "there are two reasons for this instrumental resolution selection . at first",
    ", the cut on line width removes the low mass starforming galaxies without bugle .",
    "secondly , the cut can alleviate the impact on the measured line shape parameters caused by the instrumental resolution .",
    "for a pure gaussian profile , the intrinsic line width @xmath19 can be obtained by the equation @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the observed line width and the instrumental resolution , respectively . however , this relationship is only a first - order approximation for the line profiles that deviate from a pure gaussian profile .",
    "our analytic calculation indicates that the correction of the instrumental resolution depends on the deviation not only for the line width , but also for the other two high - order dimensionless line shape parameters ( see section 4 and appendix a for details ) .      after removing the duplicates in the mpa / jhu catalog ,",
    "there are in total 3,339 entries fulfilling the above selection criteria .",
    "the spectra with the highest s / n ratios are kept in our final sample in the duplicate removements .",
    "given the line fluxes reported in the mpa / jhu catalog , these galaxies are subsequently classified into three sub - samples according to the [ ] /h@xmath7 versus [ ] /h@xmath24 diagnostic diagram using the widely accepted classification schemes ( kauffmann et al .",
    "2003a ; kewley et al .",
    "2001 ) . out of the 3,339 galaxies , there are 2,333 seyfert galaxies / liners ( hereafter agns for abbreviation ) , 793 transition galaxies located between the empirical and the theoretical demarcation lines , and 190 star - forming galaxies .",
    "there are 5,856 star - forming galaxies with line width @xmath25 , whose line profiles are believed to be dominated by a symmetric gaussian function .",
    "these galaxies are used as a comparison sample to present the scatters of the measured high - order dimensionless line shape parameters for a symmetric gaussian line profile , because of the limited wavelength sampling and limited signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "these scatters are useful in determining how strong a line profile deviates from a symmetric gaussian profile .    the three diagnostic bpt diagrams are shown in figure 1 for the final samples , in which the agns , transition galaxies and star - forming galaxies are symbolized by the red , green and blue solid squares , respectively .",
    "the contours represent the distributions of the star - forming galaxies in the comparison sample .",
    "the spectra of the selected objects are reduced and analyzed by our principal component analysis ( pca ) pipeline ( see wang & wei ( 2008 ) for details ) . at first , each spectrum is corrected for the galactic extinction using the extinction law with @xmath26 ( cardelli et al .",
    "1989 ) , in which the color excess @xmath27 is taken from the schlegel , finkbeiner , and davis galactic reddening map ( schlegel et al .",
    "1998 ) . secondly ,",
    "each extinctions - corrected spectrum is then transformed to the rest frame , along with the flux correction due to the relativity effect , given the redshift provided by the sdss pipelines ( glazebrook et al . 1998",
    "; bromley et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the stellar absorption features are subsequently separated from each rest - frame spectrum by modeling the continuum and absorption features by the sum of the first seven eigenspectra .",
    "the eigenspectra are built from the standard single stellar population spectral library developed by bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) .",
    "each of the spectra is fitted over the rest - frame wavelength range from 3700 to 7000  by a @xmath28 minimization , except for the regions with strong emission lines ( e.g. , balmer lines , [ ] @xmath294959 , 5007 , [ ] @xmath296548,6583 , [ ] @xmath296716 , 6731 , [ ] @xmath13727 , [ ] @xmath14363 and [ ] @xmath16300 ) .",
    "the rest - frame emission - line isolated spectra are used to parametrize the spectral profiles of their [ ] @xmath15007 emission lines , after the stellar components are removed from the observed spectra .",
    "the emission - line profile can be parametrized by many possible ways .",
    "the widely used ones include the fwhm and the second moment of the line that is defined as @xmath30 where @xmath19 is in units of @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the line centroid ( i.e. , the first moment ) and the flux density of the continuum - subtracted line flux , respectively . for a pure gaussian profile",
    ", we have a relationship @xmath34 , which means that both fwhm and @xmath19 comparably describe the line broadening if the line profile is a gaussian function .",
    "however , as stated in greene & ho ( 2005 ) , @xmath19 contains more information on the line profile broadening if the profile deviates from a pure gaussian profile .",
    "heckman et al . ( 1981 ) defined an asymmetry index @xmath35 to measure the line asymmetry of [ ] emission lines , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the half width to the left and right of the line center defined as the 80% peak intensity level .",
    "basing upon the index @xmath38 , the authors found that the blue asymmetry is shown in about 80% of the 36 seyfert and radio galaxies .",

    "in addition to the asymmetry , the emission - line shapes of agns vary from extremely peaked to very `` boxy '' .",
    "previous studies used the ratio of line widths at different levels to parametrize such line shapes ( e.g. , marziani et al .",
    "1996 ) .    to make the statistical study on [ ] line profile is feasible for a large sample , we adopt the high - order dimensionless line shape parameters to describe the line profile departures from a pure gaussian function ( see binney & merrifield ( 1998 ) for more details ) :",

    "a pure gaussian profile corresponds to @xmath46 .",
    "the emission - line shape with a positive value of @xmath45 shows a red asymmetry , and the shape with a negative value a blue asymmetry .",

    "we refer the readers to figure 11.5 in binney & merrifield ( 1998 ) for how the values of @xmath45 and @xmath47 vary with the line shapes .",
    "the bulk relative velocity shift of the [ ] emission line is measured relative to the h@xmath7 emission line in each emission - line isolated spectrum , because the h@xmath7 line can be easily detected and because the line shows very small velocity shift relative to the galaxy rest - frame ( e.g. , komossa et al .",

    "the sub - sample of partially obscured agns associated with broad h@xmath24 emission lines ( i.e. , seyfert 1.8/1.9 galaxies ) is selected from the parent agn and transition galaxy samples .",
    "although the existence of the broad h@xmath24 emission is direct indicative of the accretion activity of the central smbh , the underlying agn s continuum in these partially obscured agns could potentially decrease the measured two indices .",
    "these partially obscured agns are therefore removed from the subsequent analysis when the two indices are involved .    following our previous studies ( wang & wei 2008 ) ,",

    "a two - side kolmogorov smirnov test yields a maximum discrepancy of 0.282 with a corresponding probability that the two samples match of @xmath95 .",
    "in fact , the comparison of the parameter @xmath47 indicates that the difference in the distributions is likely due to the fact that the transition galaxies have systematically smaller values of @xmath47 than the agns ( see section 4.3 for more details ) .",
    "that means the transition galaxies are associated with weaker [ ] broad components compared to the agns , which implies that the feedback caused by the material outflow is less stronger in the transition galaxies than in the agns .",
    "the distributions of the [ ] @xmath0 relative velocity shifts defined in section 3.2.2 are compared in the right panel of figure 2 between the agns and transition galaxies .",
    "the symbols are the same as the left panel .",
    "a two - side kolmogorov smirnov test shows that the two samples are matched at a probability of 77% , although a careful examination suggests that the agns marginally tend to be associated with larger negative velocity shifts compared with the transition galaxies .",

    "the distributions are color - codded for the sub - samples as same as the left - bottom panel .",
    "as expected from an emission - line profile dominated by the instrumental resolution , the distribution of the comparison sample is strongly clustered around the point ( i.e. , @xmath46 and @xmath48 ) associated with a pure gaussian function .",
    "the last column in table 1 lists the average and median values of @xmath45 ( @xmath96 and @xmath97 ) for the comparison sample .",
    "the same values are listed in the last column in table 2 but for the parameter @xmath47 ( @xmath98 and @xmath99 ) .",
    "the dispersions is calculated to be 0.14 and 0.43 for the parameters @xmath45 and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "the distribution therefore validates our spectral measurements because the distribution of the comparison sample is highly consistent with the prediction of a pure gaussian function .",
    "similar as the comparison sample , the statistics are tabulated in table 2 and 3 for both agns and transition galaxies as well .",
    "one can find from the tables that the line profiles of these galaxies systematically deviate from that of the control sample ( i.e. , deviate from a pure gaussian profile ) by not only smaller @xmath45 ( i.e. , a stronger blue asymmetry ) , but also larger @xmath47 ( i.e. , a stronger broad base ) .",
    "the main panel in figure 3 shows that both agns and transition galaxies form a sequence starting from the pure gaussian region to the upper - left corner .",
    "in fact , this phenomenon is qualitatively in agreement with the fact that two gaussian components , one representing the narrow line core and the other representing the blueshifted broad wing , are usually required to model the observed [ ] line profiles .",
    "a minor fraction of the objects deviate from the sequence by their positive values of @xmath45 . by inspecting the spectra of these objects one by one by eyes , we find that the deviations are mainly resulted from the contamination at the [ ] red wing caused by the weak low - ionization emission line @xmath15016 ( veron et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "it is interesting to see that the star - forming galaxies with @xmath100 follow the sequence as well , although most of them have gaussian line profiles . in order to validate the deviations in these galaxies , the spectra with @xmath101",
    "are then inspected one by one by eyes again . to understand the nature of these star - forming galaxies with blue asymmetric [ ] emission lines , we need to carefully model all the strong emission lines in individual spectrum .",
    "the issue is out of the topic of this paper , and will be examined in our subsequent studies .    the results from the two - sides kolmogorov - smirnov tests are tabulated in table 3 and 4 for the parameters @xmath45 and @xmath47 , respectively .",

    "in contrast , the agns associated with old stellar populations always show symmetrical line profiles .",
    "the evolution of [ ] @xmath15007 emission - line profile is studied by using a large sample of narrow emission - line galaxies selected from the mpa / jhu sdss dr7 catalog .",
    "the line - profile parameterizing allows us to reveal a trend that agns with more significant blue asymmetries tend to be associated with younger stellar populations . at the beginning of discussion",
    ", we argue that the trend is not driven only by the orientation effect ( antonucci 1993 ; elitzur 2007 ) .",
    "it is widely accepted that the commonly observed blue asymmetrical and blue - shifted [ ] line profiles are caused by the wind - driven nlr outflows .",
    "the orientation - driven scenario therefore results in an odd corollary that a fraction of the agns with young stellar populations have outflow directions closer to the line - of - sight of observers than the agns with old stellar populations , while the starlight components from the host galaxies are believed to be isotropic .",
    "the revealed trend can be alternatively driven by the activity of the central smbh .",
    "in fact , there is many observational evidence supporting that the [ ] line blue asymmetries and blueshifts are correlated with @xmath9 or eigenvector - i space ( e.g. , boroson & green 1992 ; boroson 2002 ) . ] in typical type i agns ( see the description and citations in section 1 ) .",

    "<S> the agn - host co - evolution issue is investigated here by focusing on the evolution of the [ ] @xmath0 emission - line profile . in order to simultaneously measure both [ ] line profile and circumnuclear stellar population in individual spectrum , </S>",
    "<S> a large sample of narrow emission - line galaxies is selected from the mpa / jhu sdss dr7 catalog . by requiring </S>",
    "<S> that 1 ) the [ ] line signal - to - noise ratio is larger than 30 , 2 ) the [ ] line width is larger than the instrumental resolution by a factor of 2 , our sample finally contains 2,333 seyfert galaxies / liners ( agns ) , 793 transition galaxies , and 190 starforming galaxies . in additional to the commonly used profile parameters ( i.e. , line centroid , relative velocity shift and velocity dispersion ) , two dimensionless shape parameters , skewness and kurtosis , are used to quantify the line shape deviation from a pure gaussian function . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the transition galaxies are systematically associated with narrower line widths and weaker [ ] broad wings than the agns , which implies that the kinematics of the emission - line gas is different in the two kinds of objects . by combining the measured host properties and line shape parameters , we find that the agns with stronger blue asymmetries tend to be associated with younger stellar populations </S>",
    "<S> . however , the similar trend is not identified in the transition galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the failure is likely resulted from a selection effect in which the transition galaxies are systematically associated with younger stellar populations than the agns . </S>",
    "<S> the evolutionary significance revealed here suggests that both nlr kinematics and outflow feedback in agns co - evolve with their host galaxies . </S>"
