    "the renewed interest in soft scattering and pomeron physics , which was dormant for many years , can be traced to the market demand for reliable estimates of hard diffraction gap survival probabilities , notably diffractive higgs production at the lhc .",
    "we note that the present vigorous study of this subject is essentially based on sophisticated utilization of relatively old theoretical ideas and models , such as gribov s reggeon field theory@xcite , good and walker ( gw ) decomposition of the proton wave function accounting for low mass diffraction@xcite and the eikonal approximation@xcite which secures the compatibility of the scattering amplitudes with @xmath0 channel unitarity .",
    "compliance with @xmath1 channel unitarity is associated with multi pomeron interactions ( @xmath2 enhancement ) which are a generalization of mueller s triple pomeron mechanism@xcite , provided @xmath3 , the triple pomeron coupling , is not too small .",
    "this mechanism supplements gw diffraction with an additional high mass diffraction .    in this talk",
    "i shall discuss the modeling and consequent soft scattering predictions derived from the above dynamical considerations .",
    "the implied gap survival probabilities will be discussed by gotsman in the following talk .",
    "i shall assume a regge like parametrization in which the @xmath2 is super critical , i.e. @xmath4 , where @xmath5 .",
    "the above @xmath2 exchange violates @xmath0-unitarity at high energies . recall that implementing @xmath0-unitarity is model dependent",
    "i shall confine myself to eikonal models which have the virtue of simplicity .    in the isr - tevatron range @xmath6 and @xmath7",
    "are well reproduced by donnachie - landshoff ( dl ) non screened regge parametrization with @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the energy dependence of the soft diffractive cross sections ( notably @xmath10 ) is much milder , implying that strong screenings initiated by @xmath0-unitarity must be taken into account .",
    "as we shall see , the interplay between theory and data analysis results in strong constraints on both @xmath11 and @xmath12 inputs .",
    "this results in profound consequences for the nature of the pomeron and its qcd foundations , providing a unifying interpretation of soft and hard pomerons .",
    "consider a system of two fock states , a hadron @xmath13 and a diffractive state @xmath14 which are orthonormal .",
    "the gw mechanism stems from the observation that these states do not diagonalize the 2x2 interaction matrix @xmath15 .",
    "introduce two wave functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 which diagonalize @xmath15 , [ 2chm ] a_i ,",

    ", we have to consider four possible @xmath23 elastic re - scattering options . for initial @xmath26-@xmath26 ( or @xmath27-@xmath26 ) the two off diagonal amplitudes are equal , @xmath28 .",

    "i shall relate to glmm@xcite and kmr@xcite models which are conceptually very similar , but differ significantly in both their formalism and data analysis . in the present context",
    ", two procedures were devised to overcome the above difficulty : glmm lump together all gw diffractive states to an effective @xmath31 state , to which we add the non gw @xmath2 enhanced high mass diffraction . in this approach",
    "the gw contribution is very significant and the mass distribution is smooth .",
    "kmr and lkmr@xcite chose to confine gw diffraction to low @xmath32 , to which they add the high mass @xmath2 enhanced contribution .",
    "in this approximation the bulk of the diffractive mass is non gw , and its smoothness at @xmath33 is not secured .",
    "glmm , kmr and lkmr are multi channel eikonal models in which the initial re - scatterings of the incoming projectiles includes also diffractive states .",
    "[ omega ] ^s_i , k(s , b ) = ^s_i , k(s ) ^s_i , k(s , b , ... ) , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the @xmath36-space profiles .",
    "the profiles are external information in as much as , beside their normalization and asymptotic constraints on their behavior , they are determined by the data analysis . in glmm @xmath35 are given as the @xmath36-transform of a two @xmath1-poles expression ( @xmath37 ) . setting @xmath12=0 , the profiles are energy independent [ prof ] & & ^s ( b ; m_i , m_k;_^ = 0 ) .",

    "the above parametrization is compatible with the requirements of analyticity / crossing symmetry at large @xmath36 , pqcd at large @xmath38 and regge at small @xmath38 .",
    "for details see ref.@xcite .",
    "kmr and lkmr use a different parametrization for @xmath35 which is numerically compatible with glmm .",
    "the 3 groups reproduce @xmath39 well in the forward @xmath40 cone .",
    "consider a model in which diffraction is exclusively gw .",
    "this was recently explicitly considered by glmm and lkmr and non explicitly by kmr .",
    "these , as well as earlier gw models .",
    "fit the ( different ) elastic sectors of their data bases , obtaining output fitted @xmath41 with @xmath42 .",
    "the above gw models fail to reproduce the diffractive sectors of their data base .",
    "this deficiency is traced to the need to add the enhanced @xmath2 high mass contributions .",
    "this has been done in glmm and kmr .",
    "lkmr enhanced @xmath2 input is confined to eq.([3p ] ) .",
    "consider a single diffraction channel @xmath43 .",
    "mueller s triple pomeron mechanism , derived from 3 body unitarity , leads to high sd mass which is non gw . in the leading order [ 3p ] m^2_sd= g^2_p(t)g_p(0)g_3(t ) ( ) ^2_+2^_t ( ) ^_. the virtue of eq.([3p ] ) is that @xmath11 can be determined from either the energy or mass dependences of the sd cross sections .",
    "this approximation is valid for @xmath44 .",
    "cdf analysis suggests@xcite a relatively large value of @xmath3 .",
    "consequently , we need to consider a very large family of multi pomeron interactions ( enhanced @xmath2 ) which are not included in the gw mechanism .",
    "as we shall see , this `` new '' dynamical feature initiates profound differences in the calculated values of soft cross sections and non gw diffractive gap survival probabilities ( soft and hard ) .",
    "note that this features become significant above the tevatron energy .",
    "glmm and kmr treatment of @xmath2 enhanced interactions stems from gribov classical reggeon calculus @xcite and kaidalov et al.@xcite . recall that in this context the soft pomeron is a simple pole in the j - plane , while the hard ( bfkl ) pomeron is a branch cut .",
    "kmr model , which is a partonic model , derives directly from these sources .",
    "its summation is confined to semi enhanced @xmath2 diagrams ( see fig.1b ) .",
    "kmr calculations are based on two ad hoc assumptions : 1 ) the coupling of a multi @xmath2 point vertex @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) is @xmath47 . in this notation @xmath48 .",
    "note that in kaidalov et al .",
    "2 ) most of lhc non gw diffractive reactions of interest are hard .",
    "given a @xmath50 vertex , @xmath3 is unchanged by the interchange of soft and hard pomerons .",
    "this is not self evident .",
    "a possible support for the above is obtained from glmm interpretation of the pomeron ( see below ) .",
    "r0.45     as we shall see in the next chapter , the data analysis executed by glmm and kmr converges to compatible exceedingly small @xmath51 values and high , bfkl like , @xmath52 .",
    "the adjustments of these parameters are correlated . in non screened regge model",
    "@xmath11 controls the elastic cross section energy dependence , while @xmath51 controls the energy dependence of the ( shrinking ) elastic slope .",
    "as @xmath51 gets smaller @xmath11 becomes larger initiating stronger screening which compensates the reduction of @xmath51 , and vice versa . as we saw the vanishing value of the fitted @xmath51",
    "was explicitly dictated by the b - profiles glmm and kmr chose .",
    "non explicitly this choice initiated also the high @xmath11 fitted value .",
    "these results have profound implications : 1 ) a key observation of glmm is that the exceedingly small fitted value of @xmath12 implies that the `` soft '' @xmath2 is hard enough to be treated perturbatively .",
    "following gribov we identify the correlation between @xmath12 and @xmath53 , the mean transverse momentum of the partons ( actually , color dipoles ) associated with the @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath54 , from which we deduce that the qcd running coupling constant @xmath55 .",
    "accordingly , we proceed from gribov s parton model interpretation to pqcd .",
    "glmm sum over the enhanced diagrams .",
    "technically , we have adopted the mpsi procedure@xcite in which @xmath56 is reduced to a sequence of triple @xmath2 vertexes ( fan diagrams ) .",
    "for details see ref.@xcite .",
    "this may pose a problem for the calculation of sd cross section for which the lowest order diagram is semi enhanced . to avoid this problem",
    "we have added to this calculation a term by term summation of the relevant semi enhanced diagrams .",
    "2 ) the fitted high value of @xmath11 initiates strong screening which results in a renormalization of the pomeron exchange amplitudes . as a result @xmath57",
    "is reduced monotonically with energy . in glmm calculations @xmath58 ,",
    "@xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "kmr results are compatible with ours , see table 2 .",
    "the slow decrease of @xmath57 raises the question if its value may become negative at high enough energies , larger than @xmath61 which is the bound of validity of both glmm and kmr . in glmm",
    "we have checked that @xmath62 .",
    "i am less clear about kmr .",
    "the compatibility between glmm and kmr is surprising .",
    "as noted , glmm sum over the enhanced diagrams ( fig.1a ) while kmr sum over the semi enhanced diagrams ( fig.1b ) .",
    "very intuitively ( at the risk of being wrong ) , it seems that glmm renorrmalize the @xmath2 propagator while kmr renorrmalize the @xmath2 vertex .",
    "a complete calculation should , obviously , include both contributions .",
    "the goal of the data analysis of interest is to adjust a set of theoretical parameters . to this end",
    "we construct : 1 ) a suitable data base adjusted , with a satisfactory resolution , to fix the parameters .",
    "2 ) an adjustment procedure , be it a fit ( glmm , lkmr ) or tuning by trial and error ( kmr ) .",
    "we distinguish between a parameter adjustment which is executed through a reconstruction of the entire data base in one step ( glmm ) , and a sequence of factorizable adjustment steps ( kmr , lkmr ) , each adjusting a sub group of the free parameters .",
    "there is a significant difference between the data analysis carried out by glmm and kmr .",
    "this reflects both in the choices of data bases made by the two groups and their adjustment procedures .",
    "the starting point of both investigations is the observation that a gw model reproduces the elastic data well , but its reproduction of the diffractive sector is deficient .",
    "both groups claim to achieve an improved reproduction of their over all data base once the contributions of enhanced pomeron diagrams are included .",
    "glmm have constructed a global data base so as to fit the multitude of free parameters .",
    "it includes @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath10 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 in the isr - tevatron range , cdf differential elastic cross sections and sd mass distribution were checked for consistency .",
    "the conceptual approach of kmr and lkmr is completely different .",
    "their data base contains only the measured values of @xmath65 , which enables to predict @xmath6 , and @xmath66 . in my opinion",
    "kmr data base is too limited to enable a substantiation of their goals . specifically : 1 ) as we saw , the @xmath36-profiles @xmath35 control the features of @xmath65 which are only weakly coupled to the proposed dynamics .",
    "indeed , 6 models , published over the last 10 years ( 3 kmr+lkmr+2 glmm ) with different dynamics , i.e. , exclusive gw ( glmm , lkmr ) , gw+zero order @xmath2 enhancement ( lkmr ) and gw+@xmath2 enhancement ( glmm , kmr ) . the output parameters spread over @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "all 6 models reproduce , almost identically , the cdf distributions of @xmath65 .",
    "the unavoidable conclusion is that a reconstruction of @xmath65 on it own has no resolution power .",
    "the only common ingredient to all 6 models is their compatible b - profiles .",
    "these profiles constrain @xmath12 to very small values .",
    "this is the key observation leading to a pqcd ( glmm ) or partonic ( kmr ) @xmath2 interpretation .",
    "2 ) the reconstruction of cdf @xmath66 by glmm , lkmr and kmr partially substantiates the introduction of high mass multi pomeron interactions . in my opinion , this investigation , in its present state state , is unable to provide a decisive verdict on this issue .",
    "glmm and kmr sum different sectors of the enhanced diagrams .",
    "lkmr take into account only the lowest order mueller s @xmath50 diagram . regardless of these differences ,",
    "the three groups produce compatible output results which indicate that cdf data , as is , is not sufficient to differentiate between different modes of @xmath2 enhanced diagram summations .",
    "3 ) to further clarify the experimental limitations , let us recall that cdf define their high mass diffraction bound @xmath69 ( the common bound is 0.05 ) .",
    "kmr and lkmr define a lower bound @xmath70 which corresponds to @xmath71 .",
    "note that cdf sd mass distribution available for analysis corresponds to @xmath72 .",
    "this mass distribution covers less than 20@xmath73 of kmr expected high diffractive mass .",
    "glmm have a completely different classification in which the gw low mass diffraction reduces monotonically with no arbitrary upper bound and the high mass is defined above @xmath74 , identical to kmr .",
    "additional difficulties with the analysis of cdf data with @xmath75 is that an arbitrary significant background contribution has to be added .",
    "it is induced by secondary regge diagrams such as @xmath76 .",
    "an added element of ambiguity is that lkmr with a zero order @xmath50 calculation is faring as well as the high order summations of glmm and kmr .",
    ".fitted parameters for glmm gw and gw+@xmath2-enhanced models .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     glmm and kmr high energy tevatron , lhc and cosmic rays predicted cross sections are summarized in table 2 .",
    "the elastic and total cross section outputs of the two models are compatible and , above the tevatron , significantly lower than those obtained in models with no multi - pomeron contributions .",
    "this is a consequence of @xmath11 renormalization due to the enhanced @xmath2 contributions .",
    "glmm and kmr(07 ) predicted @xmath10 are compatible , where kmr(07 ) are consistently larger by approximately 12@xmath73 .",
    "kmr(08 ) predicted @xmath10 are considerably larger than glmm and are growing at a faster rate . the difference between kmr(07 ) and glmm @xmath63 predictions is even more dramatic , where @xmath77 at @xmath61 .",
    "this very large difference is due to kmr large diffractive high mass predictions ( see table 2 ) .",
    "the recent kmr(08 ) neglects to mention the high diffractive mass sector of double diffraction while showing higher sd cross sections than in kmr(07 ) .    in my opinion",
    "the glmm and kmr compatible predictions of total and elastic cross sections at the lhc and auger are of fundamental importance because they are significantly lower than the predicted values based on unitarity models with no @xmath2 enhancement .",
    "these measurements may provide a decisive support for the importance of multi - pomeron interactions at high enough energies and , consequently , imply that the growth of the total and elastic cross sections with energy is much more moderate than anticipated .",
    "this feature reflects in the slow decrease of @xmath78 shown in sec 3 .",
    "the gw base amplitudes of glmm are @xmath79 , with @xmath36 dependences specified in - .",
    "these are the building blocks with which we construct @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 ( - ) .",
    "the @xmath79 amplitudes are bounded by the black disc unitarity limit of unity .",
    "checking glmm fitted parameters , presented in table 1 , we observe that @xmath83 and @xmath84 , which are comparable in the gw model , significantly change in the gw+@xmath2 enhanced model where we obtain @xmath85 .",
    "the implication of of our fitted values of @xmath83 and @xmath84 , is that including the diffractive data in our global fit forces a large inequality between the three gw @xmath79 components .",
    "@xmath86 reaches unity at a very low energy , @xmath87 reaches unity at approximately w=100gev and @xmath88 reaches unity at exceedingly high energies , well above lhc . the observation",
    "that one , or even two , of our @xmath89=1 does not imply that the elastic scattering amplitude has reached the unitarity bound at these @xmath90 values .",
    "@xmath91 reaches the black disc bound when , and only when , @xmath92=@xmath93=@xmath94=1 , independent of @xmath95 .",
    "the approach of @xmath96 toward the black bound depends on the rate of @xmath92 increase .",
    "this rate is very slow because of the relative smallness of @xmath83 to which we add that @xmath97 increase with energy above lhc becomes ever so moderate as a consequence of the renormalization reduction of @xmath11 .",
    "our results are different from the predictions of most available models , notably kmr , in which @xmath96 reaches unity a few @xmath98 above lhc .",
    "note , though , that glmm is the only model which includes the diffractive along side the elastic data in its data analysis .",
    "all models which predict saturation of @xmath96 just above lhc have confined their data analysis exclusively to the elastic sector .",
    "a consequence of the input @xmath24 being very large at small @xmath36 , is that @xmath99 is exceedingly small at these small @xmath36 values . as a result ,",
    "given a diffractive ( non screened ) input , its output ( screened ) amplitude is peripheral in @xmath36 .",
    "this is a general feature , common to all eikonal models regardless of their b - profiles details .",
    "the general behavior indicated above becomes more extreme at ultra high energies , where @xmath80 continues to get darker and expand .",
    "consequently , the inelastic diffractive channels ( soft and hard ) becomes more and more peripheral and relatively smaller when compared with the elastic channel .",
    "given @xmath90 at which @xmath91 = 1 , the corresponding diffractive amplitudes , gw and non gw , vanish .",
    "the behavior of the ratio @xmath100 conveys information regarding the onset of s - unitarity at very high energies .",
    "assuming diffraction to be exclusively gw , we obtain@xcite @xmath101 .",
    "multi @xmath2 induced diffracion is not included in @xmath102 since it originates from @xmath22 .",
    "hence their non screened high mass cross section is suppressed by its survival probability which decreases with energy . in glmm",
    "@xmath103 , decreasing slowly . in kmr(07 ) @xmath104 , increasing slowly with energy .",
    "the partial information available on kmr(08 ) suggests that its @xmath102 grows even faster .",
    "this presentation centered on the phenomenology implied by multi pomeron dynamics incorporated in soft diffraction and its consequences on soft scattering .",
    "the concept of @xmath2 enhancement was triggered , at the time , by the assessment that @xmath3 is not too small .",
    "our view of the pomeron got more focused with the updated data analysis of soft scattering in which we get @xmath52 and @xmath105 .",
    "the implied kmr pomeron is hard enough to be treated partonically , in which the traditional classification of the soft @xmath2 as a simple j - pole and the hard @xmath2 as a branch cut in the j - plane is maintained .",
    "glmm went further on identifying the soft @xmath2 with the hard @xmath2 .",
    "this is , clearly , a fundamental theoretical issue which should be further investigated .    as it stands this dynamics is compatible with the data , but at present we can not support it with a decisive verification .",
    "a prediction shared by glmm and kmr is the expected significant reduction , compared with non screened predictions , of @xmath6 and @xmath106 at the lhc . in my opinion",
    "this measurment is of a critical value .",
    "decisive experimental signatures of @xmath2-enh are expected , essentially , above the tevatron .",
    "consequently , we should be prudent when evaluating phenomenological models which reproduce the tevatron data well .",
    "this is , obviously , required of a successful model , but is definitely not sufficient .",
    "this research was supported in part by bsf grant @xmath107 20004019 and by a grant from israel ministry of science and the foundation for basic research of the russian federation .",
