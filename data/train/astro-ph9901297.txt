    "thermal - viscous instability is widely accepted as the origin of dwarf nova and soft x - ray transient ( x - ray nova ) outbursts . in the ` standard ' model",
    ", one assumes a constant mass - transfer rate , no effects of irradiation are taken into account and the accretion disc is supposed to extend down to the surface of the accreting body ( or the last stable orbit in the case of accreting black holes and compact neutron stars ) .",
    "this version of the model , however , explains neither all the observed outburst types nor all the observed outburst properties . generalizations of the ` standard ' model which take into account some or all of these neglected , but obviously important , effects have been proposed and studied in various investigations .",
    "i will shortly discuss some recent results concerning irradiation ( hameury , lasota & hur 1997 ; dubus et al .",
    "1999 ; hereafter dlhc ; king ( 1997 ) ; king & ritter 1998 ) .    since in the literature of the subject",
    "most articles use incorrect equations to describe irradiated accretion discs i begin by repeating the simple derivation of the basic equations presented in dlhc .",
    "in accretion discs the vertical energy conservation equation has the form : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the vertical ( in the @xmath2 direction ) radiative flux and @xmath3 is the viscous heating rate per unit volume .",
    "( [ energy1 ] ) states that an accretion disc is not in radiative equilibrium , contrary to a stellar atmosphere . using the `` @xmath4 - viscosity '' prescription ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) @xmath5 , where @xmath4 is the viscosity parameter ( @xmath6 )",
    ", @xmath7 is the keplerian angular frequency and @xmath8 is the sound speed , @xmath9 the density , and @xmath10 the pressure one can write @xmath11 viscous heating of this form has important implications for the structure of optically thin layers of accretion discs and may lead to creation of coronae and winds ( shaviv & wehrse 1986 ; 1991 ) . here , however , we are interested in the effects of irradiation on the inner structure of an optically thick disc , so our results should depend on the precise form of the viscous heating .",
    "we neglect , however , the possible presence of an x - ray irradiation generated corona and wind , described by idan & shaviv ( 1996 ) .    when integrated over @xmath2 , the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ energy1 ] ) is equal to viscous dissipation per unit surface : @xmath12 which is close , but not exactly equal , to the surface heating term @xmath13 generally used in the literature .",
    "the difference between the two expressions may be important in numerical calculation ( hameury et al . 1998 ) but in the present context is of no importance .",
    "one can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ energy1 ] ) as @xmath14 where we introduced a new variable , the optical depth @xmath15 , @xmath16 being the rosseland mean opacity and @xmath17 is the total optical depth . as shown in dlhc , putting @xmath18 is a good approximation .    at the disc midplane , by symmetry",
    ", the flux must vanish : @xmath19 , whereas at the surface , ( @xmath20 ) @xmath21 equation ( [ fsurface ] ) states that the total flux at the surface is equal to the energy dissipated by viscosity ( per unit time and unit surface ) .",
    "the solution of eq .",
    "( [ energy2 ] ) is thus @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the total optical depth .    to obtain the temperature stratification one has to solve the transfer equation .",
    "here we use the diffusion approximation @xmath24 appropriate for the optically thick discs we are dealing with .",
    "the integration of eq .",
    "( [ diff ] ) is straightforward and gives : @xmath25    the upper ( surface ) boundary condition is : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the irradiation temperature , which depends on @xmath28 , the albedo , the height at which the energy is deposited and on the shape of the disc ( see eq .",
    "[ tirr ] ) . in eq .",
    "( [ bcond2 ] ) @xmath29 corresponds to the _ emergent _ flux and , as mentioned above , @xmath30 corresponds to the _ total _ flux , hence the factor 1/2 in front of @xmath31 .",
    "the temperature stratification is thus : @xmath32   + t^4_{\\rm irr}. \\label{t2}\\ ] ] for @xmath33 , the temperature at the disc midplane is @xmath34 it is clear , therefore , that for the disc inner structure to be dominated by irradiation and the disc to be isothermal one must have @xmath35 and not just @xmath36 as is usually assumed .",
    "the difference between the two criteria is important in low - mass x - ra binaries since , for parameters of interest , @xmath37 in the outer disc regions .",
    "the effect of disc irradiation is illustrated on figs . 1 & 2 ( dlhc ) .",
    "1 shows the vertical structure of a ring which is part of an unilluminated accretion disc .",
    "this ring is on the lower , cool branch of the s - curve .",
    "the energy transport is dominated by convection .",
    "the surface temperature is equal to the effective temperature given by viscous dissipation ( see eq .",
    "[ fsurface ] ) .",
    "the vertical structure of an irradiated disc is shown on fig .",
    "although the irradiating flux is 20 times larger than the viscous flux the disc is not isothermal . since in the non - irradiated disc @xmath38 k and",
    "the surface temperature is @xmath39 the optical depth is @xmath40 and , obviously an irradiation temperature higher than 14500 k is required to make the disc isothermal .",
    "note that irradiation suppressed convection and the disc now is purely radiative .",
    "the answer is ` no ' ( see e.g. dlhc ) .",
    "the reason is that contrary to the frequently made assumption a ` standard ' accretion disc is convex rather than concave .",
    "images showing flaring discs have nothing to do with reality , at least with reality described by the standard model of planar discs .    for a point source",
    ", the irradiation temperature can be written as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the efficiency of converting accretion power into x - rays , @xmath43 is the x - ray albedo and @xmath44 is the local height at which irradiation energy is deposited , or the height of the disc  as seen by x - rays \" .",
    "we use here @xmath44 and _ not _",
    "@xmath45 , the local pressure scale - height , as is usually written in the literature because , in general , @xmath46 .",
    "( [ tirr ] ) is usually used ( at least in the recent , abundant , publications on the subject ) with ` typical ' values of @xmath47 , @xmath48 ( no difference is seen between @xmath44 and @xmath45 ; the fact that there is no reason for the photosphere to be at one ( isothermal ) scale - height seems to be largely ignored ) .",
    "these values are supposed to be given by ` observations ' . however , when one reads the articles quoted to support this assertion ( vrtilek et al .",
    "1990 ; de jong et al .",
    "1996 ) one finds nothing of the kind there .",
    "these papers _ assume _ that an irradiated disc is isothermal .",
    "de jong et al . (",
    "1996 ) fit light - curves with the isothermal model of vrtilek et al .",
    "moreover , since de jong et al .",
    "( 1996 ) model lightcurves of neutron - star binaries the @xmath48 can not be applied to black - hole binaries ( especially if @xmath45 were the pressure scale - height ) : since black - holes are more massive than neutron stars , in their case @xmath49 should be smaller at a given radius ( let me add for the benefit of some readers : this is because gravity is then stronger ) , as seen in fig . 6 & 7 of dlhc . in any case , for @xmath48 the vertical hydrostatic equilibrium equation would imply high temperatures at the disc s outer rim : @xmath50 which is clearly contradicted by observations .",
    "when one calculates self - consistent ( in the sense that @xmath44 in eq .",
    "( 13 ) is calculated and not _ assumed _ ) models of irradiated discs one sees that the outer disc regions whose structure could be affected by irradiation are hidden in the shadow of the convex disc .",
    "this ` self  screening ' results from the same physical process that is at the origin of the dwarf - nova instability : a dramatic change of opacities due to hydrogen recombination .",
    "therefore , although irradiation could stabilize the disc , the unstable disc regions ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , can not be irradiated by a point source located at the disc mid - plane .",
    "models invoking the stabilizing effects of irradiation ( van paradijs 1996 ; king & ritter 1998 ) have therefore to be revised ( dlhc ) .",
    "since outer disc regions in low mass x - ray binaries are clearly irradiated , ( van paradijs & mcclintock 1995 ) model revisions must concern the disc  irradiating source geometry . to represent a geometry allowing the disc to see the irradiating source dlhc assumed that @xmath51 and calculated irradiated disc structure .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "4 . the continous line represents both a non - irradiated disc and a disc irradiated according to eq .",
    "( 13 ) with a self - consistently calculated @xmath44 : there is no difference between the two cases .",
    "as shown by hameury , lasota & dubus ( 1999 ) the answer to this question asked by king ( 1997 ) is ` no ' .",
    "irradiation of the disc by the hot white dwarf may , however , be important in a different context ( see sect . 6 ) .",
    "the answer is ` yes ' at least for ss cyg ( hessman 1984 ) and wz sge ( smak 1993 ) . in these systems it was _",
    "observed _ that the secondary s hemisphere facing the accreting white dwarf was , during the outburst , heated to 16 000 - 17000 k , which for wz sge implies that the irradiating flux is @xmath52 times larger that the star s intrinsic flux .",
    "it is hard to believe that the companion does not increase its mass transfer rate in such conditions .",
    "wz sge is a very special system anyway ( lasota , kuulkers & charles 1999 ) .",
    "warner ( 1998 ) suggested that outburst properties of su uma stars could be explained by the effects of irradiation of both the accretion disc and the secondary .",
    "preliminary results by hameury & lasota ( 1999 , in preparation ; see also hameury these proceedings ) seem to confirm that properties of su uma ( and er uma ) stars may be explained in this way .",
