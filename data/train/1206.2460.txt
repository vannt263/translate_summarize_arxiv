    "in 2003 , ong and coworkers presented a vision of history of man - machine interaction @xcite .",
    "according to this vision , the interaction evolves from manual operation through machine assisted operation and remote operations in- and out - of - sight to multiple robot management and unsupervised autonomous robot management. at the last stage of this story , multiple unsupervised autonomous robots management is expected .",
    "as it was stated two years ago by the same authors , we are at the fourth level : remote operation within area of sight @xcite . then it would be timely to think about multiple robot management. on the other hand , cooperation between robots is of interest for tens of years , with the ant colony optimization algorithm as a milestone @xcite .",
    "more recent works are at the level of applications ( @xcite to call only a few ) .",
    "in particular , cooperation between search - and - rescue ( sar ) robots is of current interest @xcite .",
    "urban sar robots ( @xcite and references therein ) can be useful in emergency situations , like earthquakes , urban fires or battlefields , for victim localization . in @xcite , efficiency of the penetration of a disaster area",
    "was evaluated via entropy minimization , performed by two robots ; the entropy was due to the unknown spatial distribution of obstacles .",
    "knowledge on this distribution was equivalent to a map .",
    "+ our formulation of the research question is related to a map sharing .",
    "we assume that a robot ant can efficiently collect an information on the corridors she visited .",
    "further , once two ants met , they can exchange the gathered information .",
    "if there is only one ant and she moves in a random way without differentiating between known and unknown corridors , the radius @xmath0 of the known area is expected to vary as square root of time . using the parameterization @xmath1",
    ", we get the exponent @xmath2 ; this is the case of normal diffusion .",
    "surprisingly enough , the same value of @xmath3 can be produced by purely deterministic rules of motion ; this is the so - called deterministic diffusion @xcite . on the contrary",
    ", the condition of self - avoiding produces an increase of the exponent in less - than - four - dimensional systems ; the flory formula @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the dimensionality , gives results reasonably close to numerical evaluations @xcite .",
    "this is the case of hyperdiffusion @xcite .",
    "( the values of @xmath3 smaller than 1/2 are classified as subdiffusion ; both hyper- and sub - diffusion are termed anomalous diffusion. ) for @xmath6 , the exponent @xmath3 is 1/2 again ; the condition of self - avoiding is not demanding there .",
    "+ the value of the exponent @xmath3 is relevant for an evaluation of the time @xmath7 , when most ants know the whole labirynth .",
    "suppose for a moment , that the area penetrated by one ant till time @xmath8 is @xmath9 . naively , ants met and exchange information at time @xmath7 when @xmath10 covers the whole area ; here @xmath11 is the number of ants .",
    "this evaluation suggests that @xmath12 .",
    "here we assume that ants move according to a deterministic algorithm designed as to penetrate the whole labirynth .",
    "then , an ant tries to omit the places she already knows from her previous path or from other ants .",
    "we ask , what is the relation between @xmath7 and @xmath11 ?",
    "also , we are interested also in the time dependence of the number @xmath13 of known cells .",
    "+ below we distinguish between the theoretical exponent @xmath3 related , as above , with the diffusion theory , the exponent @xmath14 related to the time @xmath7 of penetration of the whole labirynth as dependent on the number of ants @xmath11 , and the exponent @xmath15 related to the time dependence of the number of visited cells .",
    "both @xmath14 and @xmath15 are obtained numerically .",
    "additionally , the latter exponent is calculated for the case of random walk ; this will be termed @xmath16 .",
    "+ in our modeling , the environment is represented by a square lattice with some small amount ( @xmath17 percent ) of nodes removed ; hence labirynth in the title .",
    "the rules of ant motion are designed as to assure that the whole environment will eventually be penetrated .",
    "these rules are explained in detail in section 2 .",
    "the numerical results are given in section 3 in the form of scaling relation , as the one between @xmath18 and @xmath8 .",
    "scaling relations are useful if there is no characteristic scale within the investigated range of parameters . in our case",
    ", we can expect different behaviour before and after ants meet ; therefore the scaling exponents can be different for short and long time .",
    "last section is devoted to conclusions .",
    "the labirynth is created as a square lattice 0f @xmath19 nodes , arranged as in fig .",
    "1 . next , a small amount of randomly selected nodes ( @xmath17 percent ) are removed from the lattice . as @xmath17 is not greater than ten percent , what is less than the percolation threshold",
    ", the lattice is expected to be connected @xcite .",
    "the accessibility of nodes is verified by the standard flood fill algorithm @xcite ; if after the removal of a node some other area can not be accessed , the node can not be removed .",
    "we have checked that if an ant moves randomly in an undamaged lattice , the mean squared distance from the beginning of the trajectory increases at early times as @xmath20 , in accordance with standard theory of random walk .",
    "+ the algorithm to penetrate the labirynth is constructed as follows .",
    "an ant leaves seeds at visited nodes .",
    "if she is at a dead end ( degree one ) , she leaves two seeds there .",
    "if she is at a corridor ( degree two ) , she leaves one seed .",
    "if she has to go back in this corridor , she leaves two seeds there . if she is at a node of degree 3 or 4 , she checks the number @xmath21 of seeds present at neighboring nodes , finds a node with minimal @xmath21 , goes there and leaves one seed there .",
    "if two neighboring nodes are of equal @xmath21 , a half of ants selects a first node from the left ; another half - from the right .",
    "then , there are two kinds of ants in the labirynth . in all investigated cases ,",
    "this algorithm allows to penetrate the whole labirynth .",
    "+ each point for the curves @xmath22 is obtained for 500 different runs .",
    "each run is a new labirynth ( except @xmath23 , where there is no removed nodes ) and new initial positions of ants .",
    "the curves @xmath13 are averaged over 30 ants .",
    "the relations between the time of penetration of the whole labirynth and the number of ants are obtained numerically for two cases : + a ) first ant knows the whole labirynth , + b ) last ant ( what is equivalent to all ants ) knows the whole labirynth . + an exemplary dependence of @xmath22 is shown in fig .",
    "the obtained exponents @xmath14 in the relation @xmath24 are different in the case ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "they are also different for @xmath23 and @xmath25 . for a complete lattice ( @xmath23 )",
    ", we get @xmath14 equal to ( a ) @xmath26 , and ( b ) @xmath27 . for an incomplete lattice ,",
    "the results are obtained for ( a ) @xmath28 0.005 , 0.01 , 0.015 , 0.02 , 0.025 , 0.03 , 0.035 , 0.04 , 0.045 , 0.05 , 0.075 , 0.01 , 0.125 and 0.15 , and ( b ) 0.025 , 0.05 , 0.075 , 0.1 , 0.125 and 0.15 .",
    "the results on @xmath14 fluctuate between ( a ) 0.67 and 0.69 ( @xmath29 ) , and ( b ) 0.478 and 0.481 ( @xmath30 or less ) . we have no numerical indications that there is any dependence of @xmath14 on @xmath17 , once @xmath25 .",
    "+ these results do not distinguish between different stages of the simulation .",
    "more insight can be obtained from the time dependence of the number of visited cells , @xmath13 , which we intend to fit by the scaling relation @xmath31 . however , numerical results indicate that this fit works only in some range of time .",
    "the limitation of this range from above is an obvious consequence of the finiteness of the labirynth .",
    "the limitation from below can be due to the characteristic time when ants meet .",
    "+ our numerical results indicate that the exponent @xmath15 clearly increases with the number of ants .",
    "the dependence of @xmath15 on the fraction @xmath17 of removed nodes is rather weak .",
    "the data are presented in table 1 .",
    "there , the number of digits shows the numerical accuracy , taken as the mean square root between the simulated curves . in parenthesis",
    ", the range of time is added where the obtained function was fitted .",
    "exemplary curves are shown in fig .",
    "+    .the exponent gamma [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ gammaprim ]    as seen in the curves shown in figs . 3 and 4 , at early times @xmath13 depends on time more mildly .",
    "the observed crossover between early and late times is due to the difference between the early stage , where ants do not met yet , and the later stage where ants do exchange information .",
    "we also underline that the exponents @xmath32 are obtained from the last parts of the plots before the plateau .",
    "on the other hand , at these parts the curves @xmath13 seem to be more sharp for longer times .",
    "this means , that if the labirynth size is larger , the obtained values of the exponents can be larger ; therefore the obtained values can be treated as lower bounds of the exponents .",
    "the differences between the obtained values of the exponent @xmath14 for @xmath23 and @xmath25 can be understood in terms of symmetry of the lattice , which is higher when there is no removed nodes .",
    "similar effect is known to influence scaling relations in fractals ( @xcite , p. 60 ) . for practical applications ,",
    "the results for @xmath25 are certainly more appropriate , because buildings of high symmetry are rather rare .",
    "the obtained values of the exponent @xmath14 are the main results of this work",
    ". they can be helpful when evaluating how the search time depends on the number of searchers .",
    "we note that the exchange of information is practically important also because it assures that ants do not penetrate the area known already by another ant .",
    "+ the comparison of the results on @xmath13 allows to state that as a rule , @xmath15 is slightly larger than @xmath33 .",
    "this result indicates that the deterministic walk is more efficient that the random walk ; this is not a surprise .",
    "also , the exponent @xmath15 increases with the number @xmath11 of ants .",
    "this variation reflects the efficiency of communication between ants .",
    "the same variation is observed also for the case of random walk .",
    "we note however , that the fitting of the results on @xmath13 with the scaling relation is not successful .",
    "the problem of how the number of visited sites depends on time in random walk on a two - dimensional lattice was discussed in @xcite .",
    "the theoretical formula obtained there is not a scaling relation , and therefore the exponents @xmath32 have no theoretical importance . for labirynths of larger size , the values of these exponents could be even larger , hence they serve here as lower bounds .",
    "the obtained dependence of @xmath34 indicate that these exponents are not universal .",
    "+ to conclude , we investigated the problem how exchange of information on the geometry of environment between robots can accelerate the time @xmath7 necessary to penetrate a labirynth , i.e. a connected system of corridors .",
    "the obtained @xmath7 dependence on the number of robots are : @xmath35 for the first robot , and @xmath36 for the last one .",
    "these rules can be useful in practical applications , as localization of victims in complex environment , perhaps after some disasters . in less developed technological applications",
    ", the ants can represent personal devices , which are capable to register the map of a local environment along the owner s trajectory and transmit it to another device .",
