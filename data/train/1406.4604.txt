    "<S> we propose a novel method for low - lying states of hypernuclei based on the particle - rotor model , in which hypernuclear states are constructed by coupling the hyperon to low - lying states of the core nucleus . </S>",

    "<S> the measured energy spectra and electric multipole transition strengths in the low - lying states provide rich information on the @xmath2-nucleon interaction in nuclear medium and on the impurity effect of @xmath2 particle on nuclear structure . in this context , </S>",
    "<S> several interesting phenomena have been disclosed . </S>",
    "<S> one of the most important findings is the appreciable shrinkage of the nuclear core due to the @xmath2 participation @xcite , for which a theoretical prediction has been clearly confirmed in the experiment @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical studies of @xmath4-ray spectroscopy for @xmath5-shell hypernuclei have been mainly performed with the cluster model  @xcite and with the shell model  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , an ab - initio method as well as the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) have also been extended in order to study low - lying states of hypernuclei  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> most of these models , however , have been limited to light hypernuclei while it may be difficult to apply them to medium - heavy and heavy hypernuclei .    </S>",
    "<S> a self - consistent mean - field approach offers a way to study globally the structure of atomic nuclei as well as hypernuclei from light to heavy systems @xcite , although the pure mean - field approximation does not yield a spectrum of nuclei due to the broken symmetries . in the recent decade </S>",
    "<S> , the self - consistent mean - field models have been applied to study the impurity effect of @xmath2 particle on the nuclear deformation of @xmath5- and @xmath6-shell @xmath2 hypernuclei  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has been found that the shape polarization effect of @xmath2 hyperon is in general not prominent , except for a few exceptions , including @xmath7c , @xmath8c , and @xmath9si  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> these mean - field studies have shown that the potential energy surface of a hypernucleus is generally softer against deformation than that of the corresponding core nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the shape fluctuation effect , which is not included in the pure mean - field approximation , will be more important in hypernuclei than in normal nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , in order to connect mean - field results to spectroscopic observables , such as @xmath10 values , one has to rely on additional assumptions such as the rigid rotor model , which however would not work for , _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. , _ nuclei with small deformation or with shape coexistence . to quantify the impurity effect of @xmath2 particle on nuclear structure , one thus has to go beyond the pure mean - field approximation .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , we have quantitatively studied the impurity effect of @xmath2 hyperon on the low - lying states of @xmath11 mg by using a five - dimensional collective hamiltonian as a choice of the beyond mean - field approaches  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> to this end , we have used parameters determined by triaxially deformed skyrme - hartree - fock+bcs calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we have applied this method to transition strengths and found that the presence of one @xmath2 hyperon in the @xmath12 orbital in @xmath11 mg reduces the @xmath13 by 9% . </S>",
    "<S> however , low - lying spectra of a whole single-@xmath2 hypernucleus have been difficult to calculate due to the unpaired @xmath2 particle .    </S>",
    "<S> in fact , a beyond mean - field calculation for low - lying states of odd - mass nuclei based on modern energy density functionals is a long - standing problem in nuclear physics . </S>",
    "<S> one important reason for the difficulty is that the last unpaired nucleon breaks some of the symmetries . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , due to the pairing correlation , many quasi - particle configurations are close in energy and will be strongly mixed with each other . both of these facts complicate a calculation for low - lying spectra of odd - mass nuclei at the beyond mean - field level , although some attempts have been made recently based on the skyrme energy density functional  @xcite .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we propose a novel microscopic particle - rotor model for the low - lying states of single-@xmath2 hypernuclei . </S>",
    "<S> the novel feature is that we combine the motion of @xmath2 particle with the core nucleus states , which are described by the state - of - the - art covariant density functional approach , that is , the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) based on the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) approach supplemented with the particle number and the angular momentum projections .    </S>",
    "<S> the particle - rotor model was firstly proposed by bohr and mottelson @xcite ( see also ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , and has recently been applied also to study the structure of odd - mass neutron - rich nuclei , such as @xmath14be  @xcite , @xmath15c  @xcite , and @xmath16ne  @xcite . in this model , the motion of a valence particle is coupled to the rotational motion of a deformed core nucleus , which is usually described by the rigid rotor model . the pauli principle between the valence nucleon and the nucleons in the core nucleus </S>",
    "<S> is treated approximately . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to this conventional particle - rotor model , in this paper we construct low - lying states of the nuclear core microscopically . </S>",
    "<S> that is , we superpose many quadrupole deformed rmf+bcs states , after both the particle - number and the angular - momentum projections are carried out  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a similar idea as the microscopic particle - rotor model has recently been employed by minomo _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ in order to describe the structure of the one - neutron halo nucleus @xmath16ne with amd @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we apply this microscopic particle - rotor model to hypernuclei , for which the pauli principle between the valence @xmath2 particle and the nucleons in the core nucleus is absent . </S>",
    "<S> we will demonstrate the applicability of this method by studying the low - lying spectrum of @xmath17be .    _ </S>",
    "<S> formalism_.@xmath3 we describe a single-@xmath2 hypernucleus as a system in which a @xmath2 hyperon interacts with nucleons inside a nuclear core via a scalar and vector contact couplings . </S>",
    "<S> the lagrangian for the single-@xmath2 hypernucleus then reads , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the free part of the lagrangian for the nucleons and the hyperon , @xmath20 is the standard electromagnetic lagrangian , and @xmath21 is the effective strong interaction between nucleons . </S>",
    "<S> we employ a similar form for the @xmath22 effective interaction term @xmath23 as in ref .  </S>",

    "<S> 2 . for the @xmath2 particle in the @xmath12 orbit , when it is coupled to the core excitation states of @xmath81 and @xmath82 , the degenerate ( @xmath85 ) and ( @xmath86 ) doublet states in @xmath66be are yielded , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the excitation energies of these two doublet states are slightly larger than those of the corresponding excited states of the core nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> this is caused by the fact that the energy gain due to the @xmath2-n interaction is larger in the ground state as compared to that in the other states . for the @xmath2 particle in the @xmath87 and @xmath84 orbitals , </S>",
    "<S> one obtains the lowest negative parity @xmath88 and @xmath89 states in @xmath66be . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath88 state is higher than the @xmath89 state by 0.03 mev , which reflects the size of spin - orbit splitting in @xmath90 state of @xmath66be . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 states around 10 mev in the column ( f ) in fig . 2 are resulted from the 2@xmath95 configuration . </S>",
    "<S> the order of these states can be understood in terms of the reorientation effect , that is , the diagonal component for the quardupole term in the coupling potential in the coupled - channels equations . on the other hand , for the 2@xmath96 configuration , in which the @xmath2 particle in the @xmath87 orbital coupled to the 2@xmath97 state of the core nucleus , the quadrupole term does not contribute , and the 3/2@xmath98 and 5/2@xmath98 states are degenerate in energy in the column ( e ) in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 . a more detailed discussion on this characteristic appearance of the multiples will be given in the forthcoming publication @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the low - energy spectrum of @xmath17be , obtained by mixing these single - channel configurations with the coupled - channels method , is shown in the column ( g ) , ( h ) , and ( i ) in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the low - lying states are categorized into three rotational bands , whose structures are confirmed by the calculated @xmath10 relations . </S>",
    "<S> it is remarkable that the present calculation reconfirms such an interesting prediction of the cluster model that the strong coupling of a hyperon to the collective rotation is realized when the @xmath2 is in the @xmath5-orbit @xcite . among these rotational bands , </S>",
    "<S> the column ( h ) corresponds to what they called genuine hypernuclear states  @xcite , which are also referred to as the supersymmetric states having the su(3 ) symmetry @xmath99 of @xmath100 shell - model configuration @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these states do not have corresponding states in the ordinary nucleus , @xmath101be , because of the pauli principle of the valence neutron . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated spectrum is compared with the available data  @xcite shown in the column ( j ) in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ spectra ] . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that a good agreement with the data is obtained with our calculations . according to our calculations , the measured state with excitation energy of 5.80(13 ) mev is actually a mixture of two negative - parity states with @xmath102 and @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> the state with excitation energy of 9.52(13 ) mev , on the other hand , would be a mixture of @xmath103 , and @xmath104 states , which are close in energy .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     </S>",
    "<S> table  [ tab1 ] lists the values of the probability of the dominant components ( with @xmath105 ) for a few low - lying states of @xmath17be . </S>",
    "<S> the unperturbed energies , @xmath106 , obtained by the single - channel calculations are also shown for each component . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that the positive - parity states in the ground state rotational band are almost pure @xmath107 states , while there are appreciable configuration mixings for the negative - parity states as well as the positive - parity states in the excited band . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , for the first negative - parity state , @xmath91 , there is a strong mixing between the 0@xmath108 and the 2@xmath109 configurations with almost equal weights . </S>",
    "<S> these large mixtures of collective core wave functions manifest the strong coupling mediated by the @xmath5-state hyperon . </S>",
    "<S> this is caused by the fact that the unperturbed energies , @xmath110 , are similar to each other for these configurations due to the reorientation effect . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to notice that the values of @xmath111 obtained in the present calculations are similar to those with the cluster model calculations shown in fig . 2 of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also remark that in the second positive parity states ( @xmath112 ) the @xmath113 state is admixed appreciably , while in the second negative parity states ( @xmath114 ) the wave functions have the `` out - of - phase '' nature in comparison with the corresponding first negative parity states ( @xmath115 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> table  [ be2 ] shows the calculated @xmath50 transition strengths for low - lying states of @xmath80be and @xmath17be . as has been pointed out in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , each state in @xmath0be can be classified in terms of the total orbital angular momentum @xmath116 , which couples to the spin 1/2 of the @xmath2 particle to form the total angular momentum @xmath31 . in order to remove the trivial factor due to the angular momentum coupling for spin 1/2 and see more clearly the impurity effect of @xmath2 particle on nuclear collectivity , we follow ref . @xcite and compute the c@xmath10 value defined as , @xmath117 where @xmath118 . </S>",
    "<S> notice that this quantity is more general than the one introduced in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , since the weak coupling does not have to be assumed , although both formulas are equivalent for a single - channel configuration of @xmath119 . </S>",
    "<S> the impurity effect of @xmath2 particle on @xmath80be can be discussed by comparing the @xmath10 values in @xmath80be and the c@xmath10 values in @xmath66be in table 2 . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that the @xmath50 strengths are slightly decreased due to the shrinkage effect of @xmath2 hyperon .    </S>",
    "<S> the degree of reduction in @xmath10 with the present model is much smaller than the results of cluster model calculations @xcite . also , the energy of the 2@xmath97 state increases significantly by adding a @xmath2 particle , whereas the experimental data indicate that the energy shift is negligibly small @xcite ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) . these would be due to the effects of higher members of the core excited states , which are not included in present calculations . </S>",
    "<S> however , with the current implementation of gcm , we have a limitation in constructing the wave functions for the non - resonant core states ( that is , the second and the third 0@xmath97 , 2@xmath97 , and 4@xmath97 states ) , which extend up to large values of deformation parameter @xmath42 . for this reason </S>",
    "<S> , we did not obtain reasonable results for the hypernuclear states above 5/2@xmath120 when we included the higher members of the core states .    _ </S>",
    "<S> summary_.@xmath3 in summary , we have proposed a novel method for a low - lying spectrum of hypernuclei based on a mean - field type approach . whereas the pure mean - field approximation does not yield a spectrum due to the broken rotational symmetry </S>",
    "<S> , we employed a beyond relativistic mean - field approach by carrying out the angular momentum and the particle number projections as well as the configuration mixing with the generator coordinate method . in this novel method , </S>",
    "<S> the beyond mean - field approach is applied to low - lying states of the core nucleus , to which the @xmath2 hyperon couples in the wave function of hypernuclei , and thus we call it the microscopic particle - rotor model . we emphasize that this is the first calculation for a spectrum of hypernuclei based on a density functional approach . by applying the microscopic particle - rotor model to @xmath0be , </S>",
    "<S> a reasonable agreement with the experimental data of low - spin spectrum has been achieved without introducing any adjustable parameters , except for the @xmath22 coupling strengths , which were determined to reproduce the @xmath2 binding energy .    in this paper , we have assumed the axial deformation for the core nucleus @xmath56be . </S>",
    "<S> an obvious extension of our method is to take into account the triaxial deformation of the core nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> one interesting candidate for this is @xmath121 mg , for which the triaxial degree of freedom has been shown to be important in the core nucleus @xmath11mg@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another point which we would like to make is that our method is not restricted to the rotational motion of a core nucleus , but the vibrational motion can also be treated on the equal footing using the generator coordinate method </S>",
    "<S> . it will be interesting to apply systematically the present method to many hypernuclei and to study a transition in low - lying spectrum from a vibrational to a rotational characters . </S>",
    "<S> an application of our method to ordinary nuclei with an odd number of nucleons is another interesting problem , although a treatment of the pauli principle would make it more complicated as compared to hypernuclei studied in this paper . </S>"
