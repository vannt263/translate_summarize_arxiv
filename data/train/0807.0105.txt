    "the occurrence of stellar nuclei at the photometric center of several dwarf elliptical galaxies has been the subject of statistical investigations since the pioneering study by @xcite and @xcite , and nucleated dwarf ellipticals ( de , n ) have become a generally recognized and well studied class of galaxies in their own right ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "in the last few years the results from systematic studies performed with the instrumentation on board of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , has revolutionized the field , providing strong evidence supporting the possibility of an intimate connection between the process of nucleation and the process of galaxy formation as a whole . in particular :    * it was generally accepted that stellar nuclei occurred in a significant but minor fraction of dwarf elliptical galaxies ( @xmath10 25% * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; on the other hand , the high resolution hst analysis of a large and well selected sample of virgo des by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter c06 ) has revealed that the fraction of de , ns ( @xmath11 ) can be as high as 66% @xmath12 87% .",
    "strong support to a significant upward revision of @xmath11 comes also from the recent ground - based study by @xcite .",
    "hence , nucleation appears as the natural status of des instead of an exceptional occurrence ( see c06 for details and discussion ) . *",
    "an hst study of a large sample of sa - sd galaxies by @xcite found that a similarly high fraction of stellar nuclei is found also among these late type spirals , @xmath13 77% .",
    "in general , the most recent studies agree in finding a fraction of nucleation larger than 50% in any kind of galaxy ( see , for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , with the only exception of those brighter than @xmath14 mag ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter fc06 ) .",
    "hence , nucleation seems to occur very frequently in both dwarf and giant galaxies ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein , for a deeper discussion of the dwarf / giant dichotomy ) . * stellar galactic nuclei",
    "are found to obey the same scaling relation that links supermassive black holes ( sbh ) with their host galaxies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* c06 , fc06 ) .",
    "it has been suggested that `` _ ... sbhs and stellar nuclei are nothing but complementary incarnation of central massive objects - they likely share a common formation mechanism and follow a similar evolutionary path ... _ '' ( fc06 ) .",
    "in this view , the accumulation of a compact overdensity of baryons at the very center would be a common process during galaxy formation , while its further evolution into a sbh or a stellar nucleus would depend on various  local  circumstances .",
    "* the similarity between stellar nuclei , the brightest globular clusters and the recently discovered ultra compact dwarf ( ucd ) galaxies @xcite clearly suggests possible links among these classes of stellar systems @xcite . in particular it has been suggested either that nuclei can form by merging of pre - existing globular clusters ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , or that some objects currently classified as globular clusters may be in fact galactic nuclei , the only relics of the tidal shredding of their host galaxies that once orbited the milky way and/or m31 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* bs , and references therein ) .    within the scenario briefly outlined above , the crucial relevance of any independent observational fact that may provide some insight on",
    "the process of nucleation is clearly manifest .",
    "the mechanisms for the formation of stellar nuclei that have been suggested until now belong to two broad classes : ( a ) the orbital decay and merging at the center of the parent galaxies of pre - existing stellar systems ( star clusters ) , and ( b ) the accumulation of gas ( of various origins ) in the very center of a galaxy and its subsequent transformation into stars ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a detailed description of various proposed flavors of these classes of models ) .",
    "at present , all the observational constraints we have in hand come from the study of the integrated properties of samples of distant galaxies / nuclei .",
    "the nearest galaxies that are known to host a stellar nucleus are m32 , m33 and ngc205 , in the local group . even in the most favorable case of ngc205",
    ", the structure of the nucleus can be studied in some detail but it can be resolved into individual stars only partially , even with hst imaging @xcite . in this context",
    "the case of the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy ( sgr dsph , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) constitutes an absolute _ unicum _ ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter m05a ) .",
    "the sgr dsph is a dwarf satellite ( @xmath15 ) of the milky way @xcite whose main body is at @xmath16 kpc from us and @xmath17 kpc from the center of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "it is devoid of gas @xcite and its stellar content is dominated by an intermediate - age ( @xmath18 gyr old , see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) metal - rich ( @xmath19 @xmath20 , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) population , while @xmath21 10% of old and metal poor stars are also present @xcite .",
    "the sgr dsph is currently being destroyed by the galactic tidal field @xcite .",
    "the tidally stripped stars form a huge and coherent tidal tail system that can be observed over the whole celestial sphere ( sgr stream , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "there are four globular clusters within the main body of the galaxy @xcite and probably several others that have been stripped from the main body and are now associated with the sgr stream @xcite .    particularly noticeable , however , is the very bright ( @xmath22 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) metal - poor ( @xmath23=-1.55 $ ] ) @xcite globular cluster m54 ( ngc6715 ) , located exactly at the center of the light distribution of the sgr galaxy . for this reason , immediately after the discovery of the galaxy it was suggested that m54 could be the actual nucleus of sgr dsph @xcite .",
    "some doubt on this hypothesis was advanced by @xcite based on the circumstance that the integrated color of m54 is much bluer than that of its host galaxy , while the opposite was generally believed to occur in de , ns ; however @xcite noticed that there were exceptions to this rule .",
    "in fact , the latest studies suggest that the opposite may be true ( * ? ? ? * see also c06 ) .",
    "since the mean metallicity of m54 and of the population dominating the sgr galaxy differ by one full dex , their red giant branch ( rgb ) stars ( and in some cases also their horizontal branch stars , hb ) can be easily discriminated from each other in a color magnitude diagram ( cmd ) ; at the same magnitude the rgb of sgr is much redder than that of m54 . selecting genuine sgr stars in this way @xcite and @xcite independently found an overdensity of sgr stars that appear concentric with m54 and have a similar spatial scale . using the same technique and",
    "a very large optical photometry database m05a demonstrated that sgr has actually a nucleus of metal rich stars ( in the following we will refer to this structure as the _ nucleus _ of the sagittarius galaxy , _ sgr , n _ for brevity , if not otherwise stated ) .",
    "this stellar structure has the same center as m54 , to within the uncertainties , but it displays a different surface brightness profile , suggesting a different origin from the cluster .",
    "the strong incompleteness in the innermost @xmath24 prevented m05a from obtaining accurate estimates of the structural parameters of the sgr nucleus : they derived @xmath25 , @xmath26 mag / arcsec@xmath27 , and , with a tentative fit of a @xcite model @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( where c = log(@xmath30)@xmath10 1.9 ; we will refine these parameters in sect .  2 , below ) .",
    "they also found that the observed properties of the nucleus of the sgr galaxy were fully compatible with those of known nuclei of dwarf ellipticals .",
    "moreover , the recent study by @xcite has shown that while the stellar budget of sgr , n is dominated by the same intermediate - age population found in the surrounding galaxy , there is clear evidence of more recent and repeated episodes of star formation ( not observed in extra - nuclear fields , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , pointing to a history of subsequent phases of re - accumulation of gas followed by star formation bursts , very similar to what is observed by @xcite in a large sample of distant galactic nuclei .    in any case ,",
    "the key result of m05a is that sgr is a nucleated galaxy independently of the presence of m54 ; even if one were able to remove the cluster from the galaxy by magic , a nucleus made of typical sgr stars would still be there .",
    "to explain the strict spatial coincidence of m54 and the nucleus , m05a proposed two possibilities : ( a ) the nucleus formed _ in situ _ from processed sgr gas that has fallen to the bottom of the galactic potential well , and m54 was ( independently ) driven into the same place by dynamical friction ; ( b ) m54 was born in the present place ( or was driven there as in case a ) and formed a co - spatial overdensity of sgr stars by capturing them ( or the gas from which they formed ) from the surroundings .",
    "the key difference between the two hypothesis can be summarized by the questions _",
    "`` did m54 provide the mass seed around which the metal - rich nucleus of sgr was assembled ?",
    "is m54 the main contributor of the mass budget in the innermost @xmath31 pc of the sgr galaxy ? '' _ , that enclose the basic point of hypothesis ( b ) .",
    "hypothesis ( a ) was found to be fully compatible with all the available information , while it was not possible to consider case ( b ) in more depth . in a recent paper ,",
    "@xcite studied in detail the process of the capture of `` field '' stars from an intervening star cluster and they concluded that , even in the most favourable cases , the fraction of stars captured in a hubble time is negligible , less that @xmath32 of the cluster mass .",
    "the range of conditions studied by @xcite includes the `` m54 within sgr '' case , hence their conclusions are fully applicable here .",
    "nevertheless , the results by @xcite do not exclude the possibility that m54 operates as a collector of processed gas at the center of sgr .",
    "however it seems quite reasonable to expect that if case ( b ) is true , the stars of the sgr , n structure should share the same kinematics as m54 stars , or , at least , their kinematics should be compatible with a mass - follows - light model , or , finally , their kinematics should be different from that of extra - nuclear sgr stars , as they would be bound to m54 and would orbit within its potential @xcite . note that m54 and sgr , n are enclosed within the innermost @xmath33 of a galaxy whose core radius and limiting radius are as large as @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively @xcite .",
    "hence , even if the main body of sgr is clearly undergoing tidal disruption the kinematics of the nuclear region should be unaffected and is consequently expected to provide a trustworthy insight on the inner mass distribution @xcite .    to follow - up these ideas and to obtain a deeper insight into this unique case of a galactic nucleus that can be studied _ in vivo _ on a star by star basis , we performed an extensive spectroscopic survey , principally aimed at the study of the kinematics of sgr , n and m54 . here",
    "we present the main results of this survey .",

    "6 we summarize and discuss our results .",
    "to gain a better insight into the surface brightness ( sb ) profile of sgr , n , we reduced archive data obtained with the wide field channel ( wfc ) of the advanced camera for survey ( acs ) on board of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "this is a set of short and long exposure f814w and f606w images of the center of m54 , taken within the go  10775 treasury program @xcite .",
    "the relative and absolute photometry of individual stars has been obtained following the same steps described in @xcite for data taken from the same survey .",
    "further details and the overall analysis of these data will be presented elsewhere ; an independent study of the stellar populations of m54 and sgr , n from the same images has been recently presented by @xcite . in the present context ,",
    "we limit ourselves to complementing the sb profile of sgr , n obtained by m05a with a couple of points in the innermost @xmath36 , using the same methodology as m05a , and , as a consequence , to obtain stronger constraints on the structural parameters of sgr , n .",

    "no attempt was made to estimate the ellipticity of the system ; as the system appears quite spherical at large radii ( see m05a ) we assumed spherical symmetry .",

    "two very different populations can be identified in this plot : a broadly - distributed cloud of galactic field stars showing a large dispersion around @xmath132 km / s , and an abundant low - dispersion population with a systemic @xmath133 km / s , typical of m54 and sgr , n . as a first broad selection , and following @xcite , we retained as possible m54/sgr , n members all the ( 832 ) stars having 100 km / s @xmath134 180 km / s ( dashed lines in fig .",

    "[ besa ] shows also that most of the galactic interlopers are expected to be giants , according the the @xcite galactic model .",

    "the difference between their v magnitude and @xmath150 of sgr must be a bad proxy for their gravity .",

    "therefore , there is some hope to exclude these galactic interlopers from our final samples , identifying them by their `` odd '' color - metallicity combination , as we will do in our final selection ( sect .",

    "alternatively , it may be conceived that , during its spiraling toward the center of sgr ,",

    "it is interesting to note that in this simulation ( as well as in the cl1.2_n one ) the cluster suffers strong tidal disruption from the host halo and the final relic sitting nearly at rest at the center of the halo is probably unbound , at odds with the real case .",

    "concentric circles of radius 60 pc and 500 pc are plotted in each panel , for reference . in the top 4",
    "panels we also plotted the orbit of the bh1_n model , to show the approximate path of the center of mass of the cluster model . [ xy ] ]",
    "we present the results of a large radial velocity survey of stars in the nucleus of the sgr galaxy and in the globular cluster m54 , which lies at the center of the nucleus itself . from high signal to noise keck - deimos and vlt - flames spectra , we obtained accurate radial velocities ( @xmath307 km / s ) and metallicities from the ca triplet for 1152 candidate rgb / rc stars of m54/sgr , n .",
    "selecting by the position in the cmd , by radial velocity and by metallicity , we obtained two reliable and clean samples of 321 sgr , n members and 425 m54 stars and we used these samples , further cleaned from @xmath136 velocity outliers , to study the kinematics of the two systems .",
    "we also performed a suite of n - body simulations of the orbital decay ( driven by dynamical friction ) of a massive cluster into a host dwarf spheroidal galaxy , mimicking the m54 - sgr system .",
    "we focused our attention on the possibility to realize a phase - space match between the infalling cluster and the density cusp of the host nfw halo as close as that observed with m54 and sgr , n .      1 .",
    "we have obtained new , much more reliable estimates of the total luminosity and of the typical size of sgr , n , confirming that it is significantly less luminous than m54 and that it has a different luminosity distribution with respect to the cluster .",
    "the systemic radial velocities of m54 and sgr , n are identical within @xmath308 km / s .",
    "coupling this result with those by m05a , it appears that the two systems coincide in phase - space to within the observational errors , at least for what concerns position in space and radial velocity .",
    "the velocity dispersion profile of m54 is in good agreement with the theoretical profile of the king model that best fits its surface brightness , at least over a range of 30 core radii ( @xmath309 ) , but possibly also beyond this radius ( see sect .",
    "4.2 ) . in particular",
    ", the velocity dispersion drops from @xmath194 km / s at @xmath310 , to @xmath4 km / s at @xmath311 .",
    "the observed velocity profile strongly suggests that m54 behaves as an ordinary , self - bound globular cluster , at least in its innermost and densest region . in our view",
    ", this indicates that even if at the present epoch the motion of its stars is driven by the potential produced by the overall mass distribution within sgr , n ( see below ) , its velocity profile keeps memory of its original nature , that is an ordinary massive globular cluster orbiting within the sgr galaxy . a turn - over of the profile to @xmath312",
    "km / s around the tidal radius of the cluster may suggest that some degree of tidal disruption is occurring in the outskirts of the cluster ; however the alternative hypothesis that the sample is contaminated by metal - poor sgr stars at large radius is also viable and seems more likely , at the present stage ( sect .",
    "the velocity dispersion profile of sgr , n is consistent with being flat at @xmath313 km / s over the whole considered radial range ( @xmath314 ) .",
    "the profile is hardly compatible with any realistic king model roughly reproducing the observed surface brightness profile of sgr , n . more generally ,",
    "_ the fact that the velocity profile is flat in a radial range in which the surface density declines by a factor of @xmath315 is strongly uncompatible with any mass - follows - light model _ @xcite .",
    "conversely , a realistic nfw model reasonably reproduces the observed velocity profile and , in principle , does not conflict with the presence of an overdensity of baryons at its center , like sgr , n .",
    "however , it has to be recalled that the nfw model does not make any definite prediction on the sb profile of the embedded stellar nucleus and the compatibility of the observed sb profile of sgr , n with the nfw model that that fits the velocity profile is not established .",
    "m54 and sgr , n have definitely different kinematical properties .",
    "in particular , the velocity dispersion profiles are very different : in the radial range @xmath316 the statistical significance of the difference in the velocity distribution is very large .",
    "we have provided observational evidence that the velocity dispersion profile of sgr remains flat from @xmath317 to @xmath215 and that there is no apparent transition in the velocity profile corresponding to the onset of the stellar nucleus , at @xmath318 .",
    "this fact as well as those listed above strongly suggest that sgr , n and m54 had independent origins , as we would expect that , if the cluster provided the mass seed to collect the sgr gas that later formed the metal - rich nucleus , sgr , n stars would have shown a declining velocity dispersion profile , compatible with a mass - follows - light distribution . 7 .",
    "our n - body simulations that follow the orbits of massive clusters ( 1 - 2 @xmath319 , representing m54 ) within different nfw halos ( representing the sgr galaxy ) show that for a large range of initial distances and relative velocities , the orbit of the cluster decays completely by dynamical friction within 3 gyr , at most .",
    "moreover , at the end of the simulations , the cluster is perfectly concentric with the cusp of the host halo ( within the resolution of the simulation ) and the difference in average velocity is always less than @xmath81 km / s .",
    "hence , the observed phase - space coincidence between m54 and sgr , n can be naturally explained by the `` dynamical friction hypothesis '' ( m05a ) .",
    "according to fc06 the mass of central massive objects , independently if they are black holes or stellar nuclei , is @xmath320 of the mass of the host galaxy ( @xmath321 ) . using our estimates for the total mass of sgr , n and m54",
    "we obtain the following estimates for the total mass of the sgr galaxy , depending on whether we assume is the m54 , sgr , n or the sum of the two ( as we would do if we observed the system at the distance of virgo cluster ) is the central massive object : @xmath322 , @xmath323 , and @xmath324 , respectively .",
    "these values are in very good agreement with the independent estimates by @xcite that ranges from @xmath325 to @xmath326 .",
    "hence both sgr , n and m54 singularly or taken together have a mass compatible with being the cmo of the sgr galaxy . 9 .",
    "both sgr , n and m54 , as well as the combination of the two , when placed in the @xmath62 vs. log@xmath59 diagram lie in a region that is populated by globular clusters _ and _ galactic stellar nuclei .",
    "they are also compatible with the color - magnitude relation of nuclei shown by fc06 and with the @xmath62 vs. @xmath174 relation satisfied by globular clusters , nuclei and ucds ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ mvsigma ] hence the structure and dynamics of sgr , n , m54 and their combinations are fully compatible with other galactic nuclei . 10 . a detailed study of the mass profile of sgr ,",
    "n and m54 using the schwarzschild method ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) is currently ongoing and the results will be presented elsewhere ( ibata et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "these findings lend very strong support to the scenario proposed by m05a to explain the m54/sgr , n system : the nucleus of the galaxy formed _ in situ _ , at the bottom of the potential well of the sagittarius galaxy ; the _ globular cluster _",
    "m54 was independently driven to the same site by dynamical friction . as a complement of the above conclusions",
    ", it must be recalled that the stellar population that dominates sgr , n formed several gyrs later than m54 ( see * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . in the present context this",
    "does not appear particularly relevant , but it should be kept in mind that m54 can have reached the very center of sgr _ after _ sgr , n formed its stars ( within the last @xmath327 gyr * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or even _ before _ this , depending on the birthplace of the cluster within the sgr galaxy . in any case",
    "it is very likely that both the cluster and the processed sgr gas were _ independently _ driven - by different mechanisms - to the bottom of the potential well of the sgr galaxy , i.e. to the center of its dark matter halo . a conclusive proof that m54 was driven to its present position by dynamical friction could be provided by the successful detection of genuine extra - tidal stars at large distances from the cluster center as envisaged in sect .",
    "4.3 , while , as said their non - detection will not disprove the above scenario .    as a possible alternative to this view ( or as an extreme version of it ) it can be conceived that m54 formed at the bottom of the overall potential well of the sgr galaxy since the beginning . in this framework m54 and sgr , n are just the results of two subsequent episodes of star formation both occurring at the very center of sgr , the second from enriched gas that was infalling on very different orbits with respect to the gas that formed m54 , thus resulting in different final stellar kinematics .",
    "we regard this possibility as much less likely with respect to the `` dynamical - friction '' scenario depicted above . first",
    ", if m54 is considered as part of the ( metal - poor ) field population of sgr , its presence would be at odd with the global metallicity gradient observed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and others in sgr , as well in all dwarf spheroidal galaxy studied to date ( more metal rich and younger populations are preferentially found at the center of dsph s * ? ? ?",
    "while de nuclei have been indicated as a possible exceptions to this trend , the ingestion of large metal poor globular clusters in pre - existing metal rich nuclei seems one possible natural way to reconcile the generally observed metallicity gradients and the presence of nuclei that are bluer than their parent galaxy @xcite .",
    "second , as both m54 and sgr , n would have _ formed _ from gas falling into the same potential well , the reason for the different kinematics remains to be explaned , while it is a natural outcome if m54 formed elsewhere as a classical globular cluster .",
    "if we take for demonstrated the above concluding remarks , we can ask what we have learned about the process of galaxy nucleation from the case studied here . concerning the two main mechanisms that have been put forward in the literature , i.e. ( a ) formation of the nucleus by infall of globular cluster(s ) to the center of the galaxy , or ( b ) _ in situ _",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the main conclusion that can be drawn from the case of sgr is that both channels are viable and actually both have been at work `` simultaneously '' in sgr .",
    "the present analysis has shown that a stellar nucleus made of the typical material that dominates the baryonic mass budget of sgr is present in this galaxy , independent of m54 , as it display the same flat velocity dispersion profile as the whole core of sgr , much different from that of the cluster .    in a likely scenario , the enriched gas from previous generations of sgr stars accumulated at the bottom of the overall potential well of the galaxy , until star formation transformed it into a stellar nucleus",
    "whose surface brightness is @xmath328 times larger than in the surrounding sgr core , a substructure within a larger galaxy . on the other hand",
    ", m54 is a ( relatively ) ordinary massive , old and metal poor globular cluster .",
    "independent of its birthplace within the early sgr galaxy , its mass and the density of the surrounding medium of the host galaxy drove it to the bottom of the sgr potential well , by dynamical friction . during its trip to the densest central region of sgr ,",
    "the dense cluster managed to survive the tidal force of the host galaxy , hence it reached the present position as a ( partially ? ) self - bound stellar system .    while the mass budget at the center of sgr is probably dominated by the underlying dm halo",
    ", m54 dominates the overall light distribution : an observer taking photometry and/or spectra of the unresolved nucleus of sgr from a distant galaxy ( say , a galaxy in the virgo cluster ) would find that the object looks like a bright and blue globular cluster ; the integrated velocity dispersion would not show any peculiar feature revealing the composite nature of the observed nucleus ( see fig .",
    "[ mvsigma ] , above ) .",
    "probably , it would be impossible to disentangle the two systems from the integrated light .",
    "finally , the sgr case seems to support the observed ubiquity of nuclei ( see sect .  1 . and c06 ) .",
    "the sgr galaxy was able to form a sizable nucleus `` twice '' and with two different formation channels : if either of the two channels had not been viable for some reason , the galaxy would have ended up with a nucleus in any case . the fact that sgr is the only case of galaxy with a clear nucleus among those classified as dwarf spheroidals in the local group may suggest that the progenitor of sgr was in fact a brighter de or disc galaxy that has been transformed into a dsph by the interaction with the milky way ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* m05b , and references therein )      the results presented in this paper suggest several interesting lines of research that we did not follow up for practical reasons .",
    "however we feel that it is worth briefly mentioning some of them here , as a possible starting point for future studies .",
    "* the results presented by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , suggest that the complete decay of a massive cluster to the very center of the host galaxy is much easier and faster if a central density cusp is present .",
    "it is even possible that a central cusp is actually _ required _ to bring a cluster down to the very bottom of the overall potential well .",
    "if this is the case , the position of m54 within sgr , n would support the existence of a central cusp in actual dm halos , a point that has been questioned by several authors ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the `` complete infall '' of a massive cluster may need a nfw cusp and , simultaneously , it may transform the cusp into a core by transferring orbital energy and momentum to the surrounding `` medium '' , thus possibly providing a self - regulating mechanism that simultaneously prevent the further decay of other clusters ( that , in general cases , would be quite difficult , given the expected decay times , see * ? ? ?",

    ", it may be worth to recall also the work by @xcite , whose results militates against the presence of a large - size core in the fornax dsph , and by @xcite on the resilience of cuspy halos in major mergers .",
    "these ideas seems worthy of detailed theoretical follow up .",
    "* it has been suggested several times that bright and metal poor globular clusters may be of cosmological origin ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "if this is the case they may be very intimately linked to the earliest phases of formation of galaxies and there may have been plenty of opportunities for most of them to become the nuclei of some dwarf galaxy .",
    "the tidal stress that they suffered during their infall to the center of their host galaxies may be at the origin of the larger half - light sizes that are observed in those of them that have been suggested as possible nuclear remnants of ancient dwarf galaxies @xcite . this kind of scenario may be explored with dedicated n - body simulations , possibly including gas and stars .",
    "it would be interesting also to consider in detail the results presented here in relation with the scenario for the origin of globular clusters recently discussed by @xcite .",
    "* all the analysis presented in this paper have been performed within the standard newtonian gravitation theory and dynamics .",
    "it may be worth to consider the observational scenario emerged from this study also in the framework of modified newtonian dynamics paradigms ( mond , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , even if it may not necessarily be an ideal case .",
    "the transition between ordinary newtonian regime and mond regime occurs around @xmath329 , depending on the actual stellar mass of m54+sgr , n , that is in a range covered by our data .",
    "* there is little doubt that the final fate of the sgr galaxy will be its complete tidal disruption .",
    "once the large scale stellar body of sgr will be completely dispersed into the galactic halo , the final remnant of this ( once ) relatively large galaxy would be a faint nucleus embedding a bright globular cluster .",
    "an observer lacking any knowledge of the origin of this object would conclude that it is a very bright and peculiar globular cluster , dominated by a metal poor population ( @xmath23\\sim -1.5 $ ] , possibly with some spread ) but also including a small fraction ( @xmath10 10% ) of metal rich stars ( with average @xmath23\\sim -0.4 $ ] ) .",
    "also the abundance patterns would appear different : for instance , the metal poor ( m54 ) stars would appear as moderately @xmath112-enhanced @xcite , while metal rich stars ( sgr , n ) would have solar or sub - solar @xmath330 $ ] ratios @xcite .",
    "the radial velocities would reveal that the metal rich and metal poor stars have _ the same systemic velocity _ , but _ different velocity dispersion profiles _ and slightly different density profiles , possibly with some rotation in the metal poor component .",
    "however the dominance of metal - poor ( m54 ) stars would be so high that there would be no hint of the presence of a dark matter component . the half - light radius of the system would appear slightly larger with respect to ordinary globulars @xcite .",
    "most of these likely characteristics of the future remnant of sgr seem to have a counterpart in the widely studied and mysterious stellar system @xmath163 centauri ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , that has been proposed as the possible remnant of a nucleated dwarf elliptical since @xcite .",
    "while there are also noticeable differences between the two cases , the analogy seems very intriguing and potentially powerful cen shares with sgr some remarkable chemical peculiarities . in particular ,",
    "stars of comparable metallicity in the two systems are strongly enhanced in s - process elements and the ratio of heavy s - process to light s - process elements [ hs / ls ] is very similar .",
    "furthermore , @xmath163 cen and sgr are , up to now , the only stellar systems known to have deficient [ cu / fe ] ratios with respect to the trend in the galactic disk and halo @xcite ] .",

    "<S> we present the results of a thorough study of the nucleus of the sgr dwarf spheroidal galaxy ( sgr dsph ) and of the bright globular cluster m54 ( ngc  6715 ) that resides within the same nucleus ( sgr , n ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have obtained accurate radial velocities and metallicity estimates for 1152 candidate red giant branch stars of sgr and m54 lying within @xmath0 from the center of the galaxy , from keck / deimos and vlt / flames spectra of the infrared calcium ii triplet . using both velocity and metallicity information we selected two samples of 425 and 321 very - likely members of m54 and of sgr , n , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the two considered systems display significantly different velocity dispersion profiles : m54 has a steeply decreasing profile from @xmath1 , where @xmath2 km / s , to @xmath3 where it reaches @xmath4 km / s , then it appears to rise again to @xmath5 km / s at @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast sgr , </S>",
    "<S> n has a uniformly flat profile at @xmath7 km / s over the whole @xmath8 range . using data from the literature we show that the velocity dispersion of sgr remains constant at least out to @xmath9 and there is no sign of the transition between the outer flat - luminosity - profile core and the inner nucleus in the velocity profile . </S>",
    "<S> these results - together with a re - analysis of the surface brightness profile of sgr , n and a suite of dedicated n - body simulations - provide very strong support for the hypothesis that the nucleus of sgr formed independently of m54 , which probably plunged to its present position , coincident with sgr , n , because of significant decay of the original orbit due to dynamical friction . </S>"
