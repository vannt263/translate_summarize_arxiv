    "when and how did structures form and evolve in the 13.8-billion - year history of the universe ?",
    "this is one of the important questions we should solve in understanding the nature of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "investigating the clustering properties of galaxies as a function of redshift can give insights into the growth of structure and the relationship between galaxies and dark matter ( dm ) .",
    "the peak of star formation ( sf ) and active galactic nucleus ( agn ) activity in the universe and the bulk of stellar mass assembly in galaxies occurred at redshifts between 1 and 3 , making it a particularly interesting epoch to study ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "one of the tools to investigate the clustering properties of photometrically selected samples of galaxies is the angular autocorrelation function ( acf ) .",
    "given the acf and the galaxy redshift distribution in an adopted cosmology , and modeling the spatial correlation function as a power - law , we can determine the correlation length ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the clustering length in turn depends on the bias of the galaxies relative to dm , allowing us to infer the mass of dm haloes in which they reside .",
    "many studies of high - redshift ( @xmath16 1  3 ) populations such as quasars and submillimeter galaxies ( smgs ) have found that they are strongly clustered ( @xmath17 10 @xmath12 mpc ) as larger , and they reside in relatively massive dm halos ( @xmath18 ) ( e.g. , @xcite , but see e.g. , @xcite for a cautionary remark for trying to measure the clustering of objects in small fields ) .    here",
    "we focus on dust - obscured galaxies ( dogs : @xcite ) as a key population to understand the full picture of structure formation .",
    "dogs are defined by their extreme optical and infrared ( ir ) color : their mid - ir ( mir ) flux densities are three orders of magnitude larger than those at optical wavelengths .",
    "this extreme red color can be reproduced by active sf , agn , or both , in which the bulk of the optical and ultraviolet ( uv ) emission is absorbed by surrounding dust which heats up and re - emits in the mir .",
    "it is well known that almost all massive galaxies in the present - day universe harbor a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) with a mass of @xmath19 at their centers ; their masses are strongly correlated with those of the spheroid component of their host galaxies .",
    "this implies that galaxies and smbhs coevolve ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "galaxy merger models @xcite suggest that the central black hole and their host galaxies are obscured by a large amount of gas and dust during the initial stage of their co - evolution .",
    "a hydrodynamic simulation conducted by @xcite found that when the bh accretion rate and sf rate ( sfr ) peak in a major merger , the object tends to be heavily dust - enshrouded , and thus appears as a dog .",
    "therefore , investigating the clustering properties of dogs could tell us how structures ( i.e. , dm halos ) grow during the co - evolution of galaxies and smbhs .",
    "however , due to the optical faintness of dogs , they have not been extensively studied in previous wide - field optical surveys .",
    "thanks to the advent of small area ( @xmath4 10 deg@xmath0 ) but deep optical surveys ( e.g. , the noao deep wide - field survey ; @xcite ) and deep ir data taken with _ spitzer _ , over 3,000 dogs have been discovered @xcite , and their physical and statistical properties have been investigated in detail ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such objects have typical flux density at 24 @xmath3 of @xmath20 0.4 mjy ; we refer to them in what follows as ir-``faint '' dogs .",
    "one of the important results of those studies relevant to this paper is that the redshift distribution of ir - faint dogs is well - fit by a gaussian , with mean and sigma @xmath10 = 1.99 @xmath7 0.45 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there is evidence that the clustering strength of dogs depends on mir flux , with the brighter ir dogs being more strongly clustered .",
    "@xcite suggested that ir brightest dogs may be progenitors of previously unidentified present - day brightest cluster galaxies .",
    "however , the clustering properties of dogs with 22 @xmath3 flux greater than 1 mjy ( hereinafter ir-``bright '' dogs ) are still unknown due to their low volume densities ( @xmath21 mpc@xmath22 : @xcite ) and thus small sample size in existing surveys . wide and deep optical imaging , together with wide and moderately deep ir imaging are needed to search for ir - bright dogs .",
    "the advent of capable imaging surveys at optical and ir wavelengths ; hyper suprime - cam ( hsc : @xcite ) on the subaru telescope and the _ wide - field infrared survey explorer _ ( _ wise _ :",
    "@xcite ) , enables us to discover a large number of ir - bright dogs .",
    "we hence performed a systematic search for ir - bright dogs using the latest dataset of the hsc and _ wise_. the resulting large sample gives a statistically robust measurement of the clustering of ir - bright dogs for the first time .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ d_a ] describes the sample selection of ir - bright dogs , and how to derive the acf .",
    "the resultant acf of ir - bright dogs and comparison with that of ir - faint dogs are presented in section [ results ] . in section [ discussion ] , we derive their correlation length , bias factor , and dm halo mass after discussing the possible uncertainties in the acf mesurement , and compare them with other high - redshift populations .",
    "we also discuss their duty cycle by comparing the number density of dogs with dm halo masses , and compare it with predictions from hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "we summarize in section [ summary ] .",
    "the cosmology adopted in this paper assumes a flat universe with @xmath23 = 68 km s@xmath24 mpc@xmath24 ( @xmath25 = 0.68 ) , @xmath26 = 0.31 , @xmath27 = 0.048 , and @xmath28 = 0.69 , and the spectral index @xmath29 = 0.96 and @xmath30 = 0.83 @xcite .",
    "the correlation length is quoted in units of comoving @xmath12 mpc , and dm halo mass is quoted in units of @xmath31 with @xmath23 = 100 @xmath25 km s@xmath24 mpc@xmath24 for ease of comparison with previous works ( all other physical quantities assume @xmath25 = 0.68 ) .",

    "we selected a dog sample based on the _ wise _ mir catalog with optical counterparts detected by hsc .",
    "figure [ sample_selection ] shows a flow chart of our sample selection process . with this algorithm",
    ", we found a total of 4,367 ir - bright dogs over 125 deg@xmath0 .",
    "the optical data were obtained with the hyper suprime - cam ( hsc : @xcite ) on the 8.2 m subaru telescope .",
    "hsc is a ccd camera that covers a field of view 1.5 @xmath32 in diameter .",
    "the hsc subaru strategic program ( hsc - ssp : takada et al . , in prep . ) is now underway : we are carrying out a three - layered ( wide , deep , and ultradeep ) imaging survey with five broad - band filters ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath10 , and @xmath36 ) .",
    "this legacy survey started in march 2014 , and 300 nights have been allocated to this project .",
    "it will cover a wide area ( @xmath20 1,400 deg@xmath0 ) of the sky .    in this study , we utilized the hsc ",
    "ssp s15b data , containing the positions and photometric information of objects detected in observations from march 2014 to november 2015 .",
    "the total area of the survey footprint is about 125 deg@xmath0 .",
    "we used a sample of 1,139,880,326 objects detected in the @xmath37 or @xmath36-band in the wide layer catalog .",
    "the expected limiting magnitude ( 5@xmath38 , 2@xmath39 diameter aperture ) and the median full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the point spread function ( psf ) for @xmath35-band are @xmath20 25.9 mag and @xmath20 0.6 arcsec , respectively .",
    "the data observed by the hsc in the s15b run were analyzed through the hsc pipeline ( version 4.0.1 ; bosch et al .",
    ", in prep . )",
    "developed in conjunction with the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) software pipeline @xcite .",
    "this pipeline performs ccd - by - ccd reduction and calibration for astrometric and photometric zeropoints , mosaic - stacking which combines reduced ccd images into a single high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) coadd image , and catalog generation for detecting and measuring sources on the coadd .",
    "the photometric and astrometric calibrations are based on the data obtained from the panoramic survey telescope and rapid response system ( pan - starrs ) 1 imaging survey @xcite . in this work , we used the cmodel magnitude to estimate @xmath35-band flux , which is a weighted combination of exponential and de vaucouleurs fits to the light profile of each object ( see @xcite ) . note that since our sample is located at relatively high galactic latitudes ( @xmath40 20 ) , the influence of galactic extinction on the hsc photometry can be ignored .",
    "we limited ourselves to those objects with clean @xmath35-band photometry with s / n @xmath2 5 and removed duplicates in the same manner as @xcite ; ( i ) objects are detected in @xmath35-band ( filter01 = `` hsc - i '' ) , ( ii ) they are not blended or are children of blended objects ( deblend_nchild = 0 ) , ( iii ) they are unique objects ; repeat observations are removed ( detect_is_tract_inner = `` true '' and detect_is_patch_inner = `` true '' ) , ( iv ) none of the pixels in their footprint are interpolated ( flags_pixel_edge = `` false '' ) , ( v ) none of the central 3@xmath413 pixels are saturated ( flags_pixel_saturated_center = `` false '' ) , ( vi ) none of the central 3@xmath413 pixels are affected by cosmic rays ( flags_pixel_cr_center = `` false '' ) , ( vii ) there are no bad pixels in their footprint ( flags_pixel_bad = `` false '' ) , ( viii ) there are no problems in measuring cmodel fluxes ( cmodel_flux_flags = `` false '' ) , and ( ix ) they have a clean measurement of the centroid ( centroid_sdss_flags = `` false '' ) .",
    "consequently , a sample of 88,889,702 sources is selected in 125 deg@xmath0 .",
    "note that the surface number density of the hsc sources is @xmath42 deg@xmath43 , which is larger than the earlier study of @xcite .",
    "this is because improvements in the hsc pipeline which detects faint objects more reliably .      _ wise _ has observed the whole sky at 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 and 22 @xmath3 , with the psf fwhm of 6.1 , 6.4 , 6.5 , and 12.0 arcsec , respectively . in this work",
    ", we utilized the latest allwise catalog @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity at 3.4 and 4.6 @xmath3 in this catalog is better than the wise all - sky data release @xcite because of improved data processing , while the number of 12 and 22 @xmath3detected sources is smaller than in the earlier release because improved estimates of the local background reduced the number of faint objects .",
    "we first limited ourselves to those objects with sn @xmath2 3 at 22 @xmath3 .",
    "we then extracted point sources that are not affected by saturation , diffraction spikes , scattered - light halos , or optical ghosts by taking the saturation flag , extend flag , and image artifact flag into account , leaving a sample with clean photometry . in this work",
    ", we used the profile - fit magnitude for each band , which is optimized for point sources and thus provides reliable photometry for our sample .",
    "we converted the _ wise _ vega system magnitudes into ab magnitude , by adding 2.699 , 3.339 , 5.174 , and 6.620 to the vega magnitude at 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 , and 22 @xmath3 , respectively , according to the explanatory supplement to the allwise data release products .",
    "consequently , a sample of 9,439,990 sources is selected over the whole sky .",
    "we cross - identified the hsc sample with the _ wise _ sample using a matching radius of 3 arcsec , which yields 26,013 matches ( hereinafter hsc_wise _ objects ) .",
    "we then applied the dogs selection of @xmath44 > $ ] 7.0 , where @xmath35 and [ 22 ] represent ab magnitudes in the hsc @xmath35-band and _ wise _ 22 @xmath3 band , respectively @xcite .",
    "note that this threshold is consistent with the original dog definition , @xmath45 > 14 $ ] in vega magnitudes ( i.e. , @xmath46 > 7.5 $ ] in ab magnitudes ) , as we found based on the dog sample in @xcite ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this yields a sample of 4,367 ir - bright dogs ( hereinafter hsc-_wise _ dogs ) , the largest sample of such objects in the literature .",
    "figure [ mag_flux ] shows the 22 @xmath3 flux and @xmath35-band magnitude distributions for our sample .",
    "the average and median 22 @xmath3 flux densities of all hsc-_wise _ matched objects ( hsc-_wise _ objects ) are 4.21 and 3.39 mjy , respectively , while their average and median @xmath35-band magnitudes are 19.8 and 19.4 , respectively .",
    "the average and median 22 @xmath3 flux densities of hsc-_wise _ dogs are 4.00 and 3.27 mjy , respectively , while their average and median @xmath35-band magnitudes are 23.5 and 23.3 , respectively .",
    "about 27.1% of _ wise _ sources have more than one hsc counterpart when selecting hsc-_wise _ objects since the spatial resolution of the hsc is much better than that of _ wise_. in this study , we chose the closest object as the optical counterpart .",
    "however , this does not necessarily mean that the nearest source is always the real counterpart .",
    "we will discuss how the nearest matching influences the clustering properties of ir - bright dogs in section [ effect_nearst ] .",
    "we also note that our dog selection procedure differs from that of @xcite who discovered ir - bright dogs using hsc early data ( s14a_0 ) and allwise data .",
    "to reduce the uncertainties of the identification of dogs given the poor resolution of _ wise _ , @xcite first joined the hsc data with near - ir ( nir ) data obtained from the vista kilo - degree infrared galaxy survey ( viking : @xcite ) whose angular resolution is roughly comparable to that of the hsc .",
    "they then adopted an optical  nir color cut to the merged catalog to reject sources unlikely to be dogs before cross - matching with _",
    "wise_. they thus significantly reduced the fraction of _ wise _ sources with multiple hsc counterparts , although about 7% of _ wise _ sources still had more than one hsc counterpart . on the other hand , this method could miss nir - faint dogs that are not detectable by viking , giving rise to bias when comparing the clustering properties of our ir - bright dog sample with those of ir - faint dogs .",
    "we compared the number count of dogs selected in @xcite and this work .",
    "we found that the shape of the number counts as a function of magnitude are similar in the two cases but the number of hsc-_wise _ dog sample in this work is about 10 - 20 % larger than that in @xcite , which could mean that some dogs in this work are mis - identified .    in order to measure the clustering of our sample",
    ", we then created a flux - limited subsample , with uniform depth throughout the survey area .",
    "we narrowed our dog sample to 1,411 objects with @xmath35-band magnitude @xmath4 24.0 and 3.0 mjy @xmath4 @xmath47 ( 22 @xmath3 ) @xmath4 5.0 mjy .",

    "the random sample watches the hsc geometry , is produced by a module developed for the hsc , which we take into account the flags described in section [ hsc ] .",

    "however , the redshift distribution of our sample has not yet been constrained spectroscopically .",
    "we thus consider two possible models for their redshift distribution and derive their clustering properties for each case .",
    "we then discuss the duty cycle of ir - bright dogs and compare it with theoretical predictions .      in section [ cross ] , we simply selected dog candidates by finding the nearest hsc source for each _ wise _ source .",
    "but the nearest source may not always be the true counterpart .",
    "indeed , about 27% of _ wise _ sources have more than one hsc counterpart within 3 , which is far from negligible .",
    "we hence investigate the influence of the nearest matching on derived correlation amplitude .",
    "here we estimate this effect using monte carlo simulations . when a _ wise _ source has multiple counterpart candidates within the 3search radius , we randomly choose one object and determine if it satisfies our selection criteria .",

    "therefore , we conclude that the influence of the uncertainty due to our nearest matching algorithm on the resultant correlation amplitude is modest .      to derive the correlation length , bias factor , and dark matter halo of the subsample of hsc-_wise _ dogs , we need to know their redshift distribution , @xmath73 .",

    "therefore , ir - bright dogs may well have an evolutionary link with the most luminous sdss quasars at @xmath16 1  2 .",
    "the lines in figure [ bias_comp](b ) show the evolution of bias from the observed epoch ( @xmath136 ) to the present day ( @xmath117 ) assuming that dogs passively evolve into their lower redshift counterparts with the bias evolution given by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in both case 1 and case 2",
    ", we found that the estimated dm halo mass of ir - bright dogs is several times heavier than that of ir - faint dogs and they follow different evolutionary tracks .",
    "this also indicates that ir - bright dogs are a different population from ir - faint dogs and thus there is no evolutionary link between them .",
    "figure [ bias_comp](b ) also indicates that the bias of ir - faint dogs will evolve to @xmath137 = @xmath138 at @xmath10 = 0 while that of ir - bright dogs will evolve to @xmath137 = @xmath139 and @xmath140 for case 1 and 2 , respectively .",

    "therefore , we conclude that ir - bright dogs may trace the mass assembly of stars and smbhs through the heavy agn / sf activity within massive dm halos in the high - redshift ( @xmath16 1  3 ) universe , and that ir - bright dogs could be progenitors of moderately massive galaxy clusters in the present epoch .      here , we discuss the duty cycle of the phase in which a galaxy appears as a dog .",
    "first , we estimate the minimum halo mass ( @xmath143 ) by comparing the bias of the dogs with the effective bias of dm halos with this minimum halo mass .",

    "we then constrain the duty cycle of dogs following previous works on quasars @xcite .",
    "given this result , we estimated the dog number density and the predicted number density of dm halos with mass above the minimum halo mass we estimate . here , we assume that all dogs reside in dm halos with mass above @xmath143 and that each halo with mass above @xmath143 hosts at most one dog at a time .",
    "we define the duty cycle as follows : @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the dog luminosity function ( lf ) .",
    "we recalculated the lf and number density of dogs using the dog sample in @xcite under the planck cosmology .",
    "one caution here is that the derived number density of ir - bright dogs should be considered as a lower limit because the dog sample could miss some ir - bright dogs due to limitations in the version of the hsc pipeline that was used for that analysis .",
    "in addition , the estimate of the duty cycle is sensitive to the uncertainty of the derived dm halo mass .",
    "we find @xmath160 @xmath2 0.013 and 0.007 for case 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "if we assume that the lifetime of dm halos in which dogs reside is approximately the age of the universe at its redshift , the lifetime of the dog phase is @xmath2 0.013 @xmath41 3.27 gyr @xmath20 41 myr and @xmath2 0.007 @xmath41 5.13 gyr @xmath20 37 myr for case 1 and 2 , respectively . @xcite",
    "combined n - body / smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations with 3d polychromatic dust radiative transfer models , and investigated the ir to optical flux ratio in major mergers as a function of cosmic time .",
    "they found that the phase during which @xmath69/@xmath161 @xmath2 1000 ( thus matching the definition of a dog ) was only 10 - 30 myr , somewhat shorter than what we had found .",
    "however , the system that @xcite simulated would have a mir flux of less than 1 mjy if placed at @xmath16 2 , and thus this object would be an ir - faint dog .",
    "in addition , this simulation is for the coalescence of two galaxies with total mass of @xmath162 .",
    "therefore , given that ( 1 ) the ir - bright dogs reside in more massive dm halos than do ir - faint dogs and ( 2 ) major mergers with more massive galaxies form dogs with a longer duty cycle @xcite , the fact that the duty cycle we had found is longer than that obtained from the simulation would be consistent .",
    "the ir - bright dogs are expected to result from mergers with more massive galaxies ( @xmath163 ) than are ir - faint dogs .",

    "mir all - sky survey data , we performed a search for ir - bright dogs over @xmath20 125 deg@xmath0 .",
