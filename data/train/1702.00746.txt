    ", group - ii difluorides have been investigated as structural analogues of silica phases @xcite .",
    "bef@xmath1 is particularly similar to silica at low pressures @xcite , as in addition to being isoelectronic , the fluoride ( f@xmath5 ) and oxide ( o@xmath6 ) ions have similar radii and polarisabilities , and the be / f and si / o atomic radii ratios are similar at @xmath7 0.3 @xcite .",
    "mgf@xmath1 has also been explored as a model for higher pressure silica phases @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the structures and phases of be- , mg- and caf@xmath1 at ambient and elevated pressures , and the implications of such phases for other ab@xmath1 compounds .",
    "our approach to determining stable phases in these compounds uses computational structure searching alongside density functional theory ( dft ) calculations , and we elect to explore the pressure range 0@xmath070 gpa .",
    "the _ ab initio _ random structure searching ( airss ) technique @xcite is used to search for group - ii difluoride structures at three pressures : 15 , 30 and 60 gpa .",
    "airss is a stochastic method which generates structures randomly with a given number of formula units .",
    "a minimum atom - atom separation is specified for the generated structures , e.g. , we set the be - be , be - f , and f - f minimum separations for the case of bef@xmath1 .",
    "these separations are chosen based on short airss runs .",
    "we can also impose symmetry constraints on our generated structures such that low symmetry structures are not considered .",
    "this strategy tends to speed up the searches because such low - symmetry structures are unlikely to have low energies according to pauling s principle @xcite , although we allocate part of our searching time to check low symmetry structures , for completeness .",
    "airss has a proven track record of predicting structures in a diverse variety of systems that have subsequently been verified by experiment , such as in compressed silane , aluminium hydride , high - pressure hydrogen sulfide and xenon oxides @xcite .",
    "we limit our searches to a maximum of 8 formula units ( 24 atoms ) per cell .",
    "in addition to airss , we supplement our searches with a set of 15 known ab@xmath1-type structures taken from a variety of compounds ; see the appendix for a full list of these structures .",
    "structures generated by airss or taken from known ab@xmath1 compounds are relaxed to a enthalpy minimum using a variable - cell geometry optimization calculation . for this , we use density - functional theory ( dft ) as implemented in the castep plane - wave pseudopotential code @xcite , with internally - generated ultrasoft pseudopotentials @xcite and the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) exchange - correlation functional @xcite .",

    "our calculations of phonon frequencies use the quasiharmonic approximation ( qha ) @xcite and a finite - displacement supercell method , as implemented in castep .    as well as searches for new bef@xmath1 , mgf@xmath1 and caf@xmath1 structures , we have also carried out variable stoichiometry structure searching at 60 gpa , to examine the possibility of other thermodynamically stable compositions .",
    "these searches predict that bef@xmath1 and mgf@xmath1 are the only stable stoichiometries at 60 gpa , while both caf@xmath1 and caf@xmath10 are stable at that pressure .",
    "our predicted caf@xmath10 structure is cubic with @xmath11 symmetry , and the same structure has in fact been previously predicted for high - pressure aluminium hydride ( alh@xmath10 ) @xcite .",
    "we have not examined the properties of high - pressure caf@xmath10 further , and in what follows we focus only on the ab@xmath1 difluoride stoichiometry .",
    "convex hulls for our variable stoichiometry searches are given in the appendix .",
    "semilocal density functionals such as pbe typically underestimate the calculated band gap in materials . in order to capture the optical properties of the group ii difluorides , we perform optical bandgap calculations with the non - local heyd - scuseria - ernzerhof ( hse06 ) functional @xcite .",
    "this functional incorporates 25% screened exchange and is expected to generally improve the accuracy of bandgap calculations carried out with dft , though at a greater computational cost .",
    "we adopt the following calculation strategy : structures are first relaxed with the pbe functional , norm - conserving pseudopotentials @xcite , a basis set cutoff of 1600 ev and a relatively sparse brillouin zone sampling of @xmath12 @xmath9 .",
    "the hse06 functional is then used with pbe - relaxed geometries for a self - consistent calculation of the electronic bands of the structure .",

    "<S> we investigate the high - pressure behaviour of beryllium , magnesium and calcium difluorides using _ ab initio _ random structure searching and density functional theory ( dft ) calculations , over the pressure range 0@xmath070 gpa . </S>",
    "<S> beryllium fluoride exhibits extensive polymorphism at low pressures , and we find two new phases for this compound @xmath0 the silica moganite and cacl@xmath1 structures @xmath0 which are stable over the wide pressure range 12@xmath057 gpa . for magnesium fluoride , our searching results show that the orthorhombic ` o - i ' tio@xmath1 structure ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) is stable for this compound between 40 and 44 gpa . </S>",
    "<S> our searches find no new phases at the static - lattice level for calcium difluoride between 0 and 70 gpa ; however , a phase with @xmath4 symmetry is close to stability over this pressure range , and our calculations predict that this phase is stabilised at high temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath4 structure exhibits an unstable phonon mode at large volumes which may signal a transition to a superionic state at high temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the group - ii difluorides are isoelectronic to a number of other ab@xmath1-type compounds such as sio@xmath1 and tio@xmath1 , and we discuss our results in light of these similarities .    0.25 cm </S>"
