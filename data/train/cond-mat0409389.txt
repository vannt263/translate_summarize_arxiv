    "it is nowadays possible to calculate properties from first principles for a wide range of materials .",
    "this is mainly due to the success of density - functional theory ( dft ) @xcite .",
    "although the exact exchange - correlation functional is not known , useful approximations are available , the most widespread ones being the local - density approximation ( lda ) @xcite and the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) @xcite .",
    "while dft methods perform very well in a wide range of bonding situations ( metallic , covalent , ionic ) , both lda and gga have serious problems describing weakly bound systems such as van der waals ( vdw ) crystals @xcite . here",
    ", an alternative is to invoke wavefunction - based ab - initio methods of quantum chemistry @xcite .",
    "these methods allow for a proper account of the vdw interaction in small clusters of atoms ( dimers , trimers , ... ) , and , inserting these data into a many - body expansion of the bulk cohesive energy , it is possible to extract from them reliable results for rare - gas crystals @xcite .",
    "mercury is a special case : starting from the vdw bound dimer ( dissociation energy : 0.05 ev @xcite ) , there is a smooth transition from vdw clusters ( up to about 20 atoms ) to covalent clusters and to the metallic system ( more than 400 atoms ) @xcite , finally leading to the metallic solid with its overlapping @xmath1 bands ( cohesive energy per atom : 0.79 ev @xcite ) .",
    "whereas the weakly bound dimer can only be reliably described with highly correlated wavefunction - based methods ( like the coupled - cluster ( cc ) approach ) and extended correlation consistent atomic basis sets @xcite , one would expect that the metallic solid should be well described within dft .",
    "unfortunately , this seems to be not the case : various functionals yield very different results @xcite , from overbinding ( by 30% with lda ) to severe underbinding ( by a factor of nearly 3 with typical gga functionals like pbe ) .",
    "mixing in hartree - fock ( hf ) contributions to form hybrid functionals like b3lyp does not help either : with pure hf , the crystal energy at the equilibrium lattice constant is repulsive by about the same magnitude as the experimental value is attractive @xcite ; the binding is entirely due to electron correlation . on the other hand",
    ", it may not be surprising that a many - body expansion derived from wavefunction - based correlated cluster data ( dimers , trimers , ... ) is of rather limited success also @xcite , since the metallic bonding of the solid has not much in common with the vdw like behaviour of the smaller clusters . in order to make such an expansion work ,",
    "it is necessary to introduce solid - state information from the outset .",
    "an attempt into this direction has been made very recently by two of us @xcite .",
    "a method has been proposed for solid mercury , where the mean - field ( hartree - fock ) part is calculated for the infinite solid and only the correlation part is determined within a many - body expansion using the wavefunction - based cc approach ; moreover , the cc calculations have been performed for finite , but embedded clusters which mimic the confinement of the electrons in the solid . this way ,",
    "very good agreement with the experimental cohesive energy has been obtained . in the present paper",
    ", we discuss this method in detail , and we compare it with other variants of many - body expansions , with and without embedding , to discuss the convergence behaviour . in the next section ( sec .",
    "ii ) we present our hf calculations . in sec .",
    "iii we discuss different possible ways of setting up the many - body expansion . in sec .",
    "iv we construct the embedding .",
    "after that ( secs . v to viii )",
    "the individual contributions to the various many - body expansions are presented . from these",
    ", the cohesive energy of mercury is evaluated in sec .",
    "ix , and conclusions follow in sec . x.",
    "for calculating the hf contribution to the binding in bulk hg ( rhombohedral structure , with equilibrium lattice constant @xmath2  and @xmath3 @xcite ) , we use the program package crystal98 @xcite .",
    "we changed the default parameters in order to obtain a converged result for the hf binding energy , i.e. we set integral thresholds to @xmath410@xmath5 a.u . and convergence criteria for the total energy and the orbital coefficients to 10@xmath6 a.u . and 10@xmath7 a.u .",
    ", respectively ; our @xmath8-mesh involved 9825 @xmath8-points in a gilat net .",
    "the chemically inactive [ kr]@xmath9 core of the hg atom is simulated by an energy - consistent scalar - relativistic pseudopotential ( pp ) @xcite . in crystal98 ,",
    "the bloch functions of the solid are generated using local gaussian - type ( gto ) basis functions . in principle , gto sets optimized for atoms could be used ; however , diffuse functions describing atomic tails are not necessary in the densely packed solid ( and would in fact lead to convergence difficulties in the scf procedure if used nevertheless ) . in our calculations",
    "we start from a @xmath10 set of primitive gaussians@xcite ; we leave out the most diffuse @xmath11 and @xmath12 function and partially reoptimize the next inner ones for the crystal ( the resulting exponential parameters are 0.126 for both @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) ; we next form fixed linear combinations ( contractions ) of the first three @xmath11 and @xmath12 gaussians and of the first four @xmath13 gaussians using the @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 atomic orbitals as contraction coefficients ; finally , we leave out the @xmath18 polarization function because such functions are not too important for the hf cohesive energy of metals without an open @xmath13-shell .",
    "the resulting contracted gto ( cgto ) basis set can be characterized as @xmath19 $ ] . in order to provide an",
    "_ a - posteriori _",
    "justification for the truncation of the original atomic basis set , we performed a free - atom calculation with the modified ( crystal ) basis centered at the site of the atom _ and _ at the 12 neighbouring atomic positions of the solid .",
    "the resulting atomic hf energy is only about 1 mhartree higher than that obtained in a standard free - atom calculation with the original uncontracted @xmath10 basis set , so that we can use the former value as a reference for calculating the cohesive energy of the solid",
    ".    the calculated hf cohesive energy ( binding energy per atom ) of solid mercury in the rhombohedral structure is listed in table [ cohen ] .",
    "it is seen that there is no binding at the hf level , at least not at the experimental lattice constant of the crystal , in spite of the metallic behaviour signalled by the overlap of the bands derived from the 6@xmath11 and @xmath20 atomic orbitals ; the hf repulsion is of about the same magnitude as the experimental value of the cohesive energy .",
    "there is no binding either at the hf level for the dimer hg@xmath21 @xcite , and most likely for all hg@xmath22 clusters up to the solid state .",
    "this situation is usually found for vdw systems only .",
    "when setting up a many - body expansion of the form @xmath23 for the crystal energy ( or part of it ) , one first has to specify the meaning of the @xmath24-body indices @xmath25 . both for a vdw crystal and a metal ,",
    "a numbering in terms of atoms seems to be natural .",
    "however , only if local interactions prevail will @xmath24-body contributions for distant atom pairs @xmath26 , triples @xmath27 , etc .",
    "decay fast enough to make such an expansion useful .",
    "in its simplest form , @xmath28 is the total crystal energy , the @xmath29 are taken as the ( total ) energies of the free atoms , the @xmath30 are the non - additive parts of the total energies @xmath31 for ( isolated ) pairs of atoms @xmath26 : @xmath32 similarly , the @xmath33 are non - additive parts of the total energies @xmath34 of trimers corrected for pair interactions : @xmath35 such an expansion has been shown to work very well for vdw crystals like the rare gases @xcite . here , the decay of the contributions is fast enough with distance ( @xmath36 in the leading term of the vdw pair interaction ) , the expansion is dominated by pair contributions making higher terms almost negligible , and the nature of the interaction changes very little when going from small clusters ( dimers , trimers , ... ) to the infinite crystal .",
    "it may be argued that it is just the last point which makes this type of expansion less successful for mercury : the metallic solid has not very much in common with the vdw bound small clusters .",
    "however , we will see that even for smaller mercury clusters , where we would still expect some vdw like behaviour , the convergence of the many - body expansion is not smooth at smaller distances .",
    "an obvious possibility for improvement is to treat the hf part of the total energy separately , i.e. , without many - body expansion , in a calculation for the bulk solid like in sec .",
    "the many - body expansion for the remaining part of the total energy ( the correlation energy ) is expected to be both less problematic and more general , since i ) electron correlation effects are known to be more local than interactions at the independent - particle level , and ii ) the decay of electron - correlation contributions for distant pairs of localized orbitals ( or orbital groups ) shows a vdw - like behaviour not only in vdw crystals but also in ionic and covalently bonded systems .    still , localized entities in ionic and covalently bonded solids may be quite different from those in free ( neutral ) atoms or small clusters .",
    "therefore , it may be vital to base the many - body expansion of the correlation energy on suitable localized orbitals or orbital groups as they appear in the solid ( e.g. , atoms or ions modified by crystal surroundings , bond orbitals , etc . ) ; the necessary information can be taken directly from solid - state calculations or from calculations for suitably embedded clusters .",
    "such a type of expansion has been successfully applied by our group to a wide range of ionic crystals and semiconductors , cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite .",
    "a direct transfer of this approach to metallic systems is not possible , however , since localized orbitals become very long - range entities here and a many - body expansion in terms of such orbitals can not be expected to have useful convergence characteristics .",
    "moreover , it is currently not clear how to treat electron correlation within wave - function based methods for metallic systems , since it becomes highly multi - configurational in nature , and a full ci treatment is not feasible . in order to make the expansion still computationally feasible ,",
    "we have suggested recently @xcite to start from suitable model systems where long - range orbital tails are absent , and to allow for delocalization only successively in the course of the expansion ; more specifically , when calculating pair contributions for a given orbital ( or orbital group ) combination ( @xmath26 ) , we allow for delocalization @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and similarly with the 3-body terms we allow for delocalization over the triples of atoms , etc . it is clear that the final result is not affected , only the convergence properties of the many - body expansion are changed . as an additional advantage , we can calculate individual terms of the expansion from ( suitably modelled / embedded ) finite clusters of reasonable size . in the case of mercury , for example",
    ", we can force localization of the solid by using a @xmath11-type atomic basis set for describing the valence - electron system .",
    "this way , delocalization due to @xmath1-mixing is avoided , but still each atom has its correct crystal surroundings concerning the van der waals interaction .",
    "when determining a many - body contribution for a given set of atoms , we can use the full basis for this set of atoms and thus successively allow for metallic delocalization .",
    "as already mentioned in the previous section , we want to use finite cluster models for embedded @xmath24-tuples of atoms , in order to calculate individual terms ( @xmath24-body increments ) of the many - body expansion of mercury .",
    "these cluster models have to meet the following requirements : i ) their geometry should reflect the experimental geometry of a suitably chosen section of the hg crystal , in order to mimic the influence of the bulk surroundings on the @xmath24 inner atoms to be correlated ; ii ) their electronic structure should simulate that of a hypothetical hg crystal with the highest occupied band derived from atomic @xmath17 states only , whose wannier orbitals are well localized and well transferable , without significant finite - size and surface effects , to the cluster models in question .    according to requirement i ) , the geometries of the embedded clusters were generated as follows . the rhombohedral structure of the infinite crystal can be viewed as a central atom surrounded by atom shells of various size .",
    "the first shell contains 12 atoms , 6 of them at distance @xmath39 ( = 3.005  ) and 6 at 1.155 @xmath39 ; the next shells contain 6 atoms at distance 1.528 @xmath39 , 6 atoms at 1.633 @xmath39 another 24 atoms up to a distance of 2 @xmath39 .",
    "this already defines various levels of embedding for a single atom when calculating the one - body term of the many - body expansion . for calculating a two - body term between neighbouring atoms",
    ", we include all atoms in the embedding which are in the first shell of one of the two atoms to be correlated .",
    "if the two atoms to be correlated are more distant , we additionally select for the embedding all atoms lying within a cylinder of the shell radius around the connection line .",
    "since the number of embedding atoms is large , we do not use here the small - core ( 20-valence - electron ) pseudopotential mentioned in sec . 2 , but rather a 2-valence - electron scalar relativistic pseudopotential@xcite which simulates the hg @xmath40 shells within the atomic core .",
    "thus , only the @xmath41 and higher atomic shells are explicitly treated ; truncating the corresponding optimized @xmath42 $ ] valence basis set to @xmath43 $ ] , we satisfy requirement ii ) .    for calculating the individual @xmath24-body increments in the embedded clusters",
    ", we have to treat the orbitals of the @xmath24 atoms involved ( which are in the center of the embedded cluster ) as accurately as possible .",
    "we equip these atoms with the small - core pseudopotential , i.e. , we explicitly treat the outer - core @xmath44 shells in the valence space ; furthermore , we invoke the ( unmodified ) primitive @xmath10 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 basis sets of ref .",
    "two different contraction patterns of these primitive basis sets are considered in the following . in the first step of our calculation ,",
    "the aim is to define the localized orbitals corresponding to the hypothetical mercury mentioned above . here , we choose contractions which are closely analogous to that for the embedding atoms : the outer - core @xmath44 orbitals and the valence @xmath17 orbital are fully contracted using the orbital coefficients of the free atoms , and the most diffuse @xmath11 function of the primitive sets are added to provide more flexibility within the @xmath11 space ; this leads to a @xmath47 $ ] set . since valence @xmath12 functions are not represented in these basis sets , delocalization of the orbitals is still avoided .",
    "thus , a unitary transformation of the occupied canonical orbitals according to the criterion of foster and boys @xcite yields well localized orbitals on the individual atoms , which can be separated into embedding orbitals and orbitals to be correlated .    in the next step ,",
    "we improve the description of the atoms to be correlated while keeping frozen the localized orbitals which can be attributed to the atoms of the embedding region .",
    "the basis sets of the former atoms are enlarged by successively decontracting the above - mentioned basis sets with respect to the most diffuse exponents .",
    "specifically we consider a @xmath48 $ ] set ( basis a ) , a @xmath49 $ ] set ( basis b ) , and a @xmath50 $ ] set ( basis c ) .",
    "using these basis sets , we recalculate the integrals and reoptimize the orbitals of the atoms to be correlated , in a hf calculation .",
    "this provides us with orbitals which are still fairly local but are more or less delocalized over the atoms @xmath51 to be correlated . finally , on top of this hf calculation and still keeping frozen the localized orbitals of the embedding region , we introduce electron correlation by performing a coupled - cluster calculation with single and double excitations and perturbative treatment of the triples ( ccsd(t ) ) .",
    "all these calculations are performed using the molpro suite of ab - initio programs @xcite .",
    "note that only the correlation - energy piece , @xmath52 , of the last calculation enters the many - body expansion of sec .",
    "iii ( eqs . 1 - 3 ) .",
    "test calculations have been performed checking the influence of geometry ( number of shells with embedding atoms ) and basis - set description of the embedding region on the calculated @xmath24-body increments .",
    "for the one - body increment we checked clusters with up to 7 shells , for the nearest - neighbour two - body increment clusters with up to 4 shells .",
    "all calculated one - body and two - body increments differ by at most by 0.1mhartree , respectively . on the basis of these test calculations and in order to avoid excessive computational effort , we feel justified to restrict embedding to the first shell , for the calculations of the following sections , and to describe the embedding atoms with the large - core pseudopotential and the corresponding @xmath43 $ ] basis set .",
    "it is only for the many - body expansion with embedding that the one - body increment can contribute to the binding . we define the cohesive contribution of the one - body increment as the difference between the correlation energy of the embedded atom @xmath29 and that of the free atom @xmath53 .",
    "@xmath54 the free atom is calculated with the same basis as the embedded atom , but in order to minimize basis - set superposition effects we add one shell of ghost atoms ( i.e. , atoms with zero charge carrying ( 4s)/[2s ] basis sets ) at the 12 nearest - neighbour sites of the mercury lattice .",
    "the difference between the correlation energy with this basis set and that with the uncontracted basis set of the free atom is less than 1 mhartree .    in table",
    "[ onebody ] , the one - body contribution to the binding is listed for different basis sets , and different number of correlated atomic orbital shells .",
    "all contributions are repulsive ; the embedded atom has a smaller ( absolute ) correlation energy than the free atom .",
    "this effect is due to the crystal cage effect leading to a more compact @xmath55 shell but also to increased excitation energies .",
    "as can be anticipated the dominant correlation contributions to @xmath56 come from the @xmath55 shell .",
    "intra - shell contributions from the outer - core shells are also repulsive , but significantly smaller ; moreover the latter contributions are nearly compensated by the @xmath57 inter - shell correlation which becomes increasingly attractive with increasing compactness of the in - crystal atoms .",
    "interestingly , although @xmath58 inter - shell effects are small in magnitude they can be seen to become repulsive again .",
    "finally , basis effects are small : adding diffuse functions ( as detailed in sect .",
    "6 ) , or going from basis set b to c changes the total @xmath56 by not more than 0.1 mhartree .",
    "in a first step , we checked our basis sets for the free dimer where experimental values and data from accurate calculations are available in literature@xcite .",
    "since the vdw binding is very weak ( of the order of 1 mhartree ) and relies on an accurate description of the orbital tails , we added diffuse functions to our basis sets ; more specifically , one diffuse function for each @xmath59 value was added in an even - tempered way ( the resulting basis sets being designated as auga , augb , augc ) . in fig.[dimer ] , the hg@xmath21 potential curve is plotted for basis sets b , augb , and augc , for various choices of the active space of correlated orbitals ; all curves contain counterpoise corrections @xcite for ( approximately ) removing basis - set superposition errors .",
    "the hf curve is purely repulsive . correlating the @xmath55 shell leads to binding , but the dissociation energy @xmath60 is too small by more than a factor of 3 , with respect to the experimental value , and the bond length @xmath61 is too long by more than 0.6  . only with correlating the outer - core @xmath62 shell",
    "is it possible to obtain reasonable results ; the influence of the underlying @xmath63 shells , on the other hand , is only marginal .",
    "more important than the latter correlation effect is the role of the basis set ; especially prominent is the role of the diffuse functions , as shown by comparing the b and augb curves : @xmath60 is enhanced by nearly a factor of 2 , @xmath61 is shortened by @xmath640.3  ; going from basis augb to augc leads to further improvement and yields the following values for the spectroscopic constants ( experimental values in parentheses ) : 3.80 ( 3.69@xmath650.01 )   for @xmath61 , 17.9 ( 19.6@xmath650.3 ) @xmath66 for the harmonic wavenumber @xmath67 , and 328 ( 380@xmath6515 ) @xmath66 for @xmath60 .",
    ".[onebody ] the one - body contribution to the cohesive energy @xmath68 of embedded clusters ( in hartree ) is calculated at the ccsd(t ) level with different basis sets ( b , augb , augc ) , and different active spaces included in the correlation treatment . for more details , cf",
