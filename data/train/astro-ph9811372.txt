    "pg 1224 + 309 was cataloged as a uv - excess object in the palomar - green ( pg ) survey ( green , schmidt , & liebert 1986 ) .",
    "it also appears in the tonantzintla survey as ton 617 ( iriarte & chavira 1957 ; chavira 1958 ) and the case low - dispersion northern sky survey as cbs 60 ( sanduleak & pesch 1984 ) .",
    "its mean magnitude and colors are @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 ( this work ) .",
    "this object was studied by ferguson , green , & liebert ( 1984 ) who were searching for cataclysmic variable - like stars in the pg survey .",
    "ferguson et al .  ( 1984 ) showed that pg 1224 + 309 was a binary , identified the hot star as a da white dwarf with @xmath19  k and @xmath20 , and classified the cool star as an m2 dwarf based on its colors .",
    "refined values of @xmath21  k and @xmath22 for the white dwarf were later provided by j.  w.  liebert & p.  bergeron ( 1997 ) .",
    "pg1224 + 309 was not discussed again in the literature for thirteen years .",
    "orosz , wade , & harlow ( 1997 ) looked for radial velocity variations in a number of stars that were characterized as composite spectrum binaries by ferguson et al .",

    "orosz et al .  (",
    "1997 ) also showed that pg 1224 + 309 has a strong and variable h@xmath0 emission line .",

    "we therefore obtained additional photometric and spectroscopic data on this object , reported in this paper .",
    "our goals were to characterize the orbit , to estimate the masses and other properties of the two stars , and to place the system in its evolutionary context .",
    "the additional data confirm that pg 1224 + 309 is a short - period , double - lined spectroscopic binary system with photometric and emission - line variations evidently caused by illumination of one hemisphere of the cool m star by the hot white dwarf .",
    "we present below a description of our observations and data analysis .",
    "we discuss various constraints on the component masses and the geometry of the system and end with a brief discussion of the evolutionary status of this binary star .",
    "systems such as pg 1224 + 309 may illuminate difficult aspects of common - envelope binary evolution .",
    "we obtained 55 exposures between 1996 december and 1998 march using either the 2.4 m hiltner telescope and modular spectrograph , or the 1.3 m mcgraw - hill telescope and mark iii spectrograph .",

    "individual exposures were 300 to 600 s at the 2.4 m telescope , and typically 900 s at the 1.3 m. all stellar spectra were bracketed in time with comparison - lamp exposures , and typical rms residuals of the wavelength solutions were @xmath30  .",
    "standard iraf _ specred _ tasks were used to subtract the electronic bias , divide by flat - fields , optimally extract one - dimensional spectra , subtract sky background , and rebin the spectra onto a uniform wavelength scale .",
    "we obtained spectra of hot stars and flux standards to convert our spectra to absolute flux units .    at the 2.4 m we used a narrow slit ( 1 arcsec ) , so our spectrophotometry suffers from variable , uncalibrated losses at the slit jaws ; we estimate that this effect introduces a @xmath31 percent uncertainty in our absolute flux levels .",
    "in addition , continuum shapes derived with the modular spectrograph sometimes suffer 1020 per cent errors in their overall slopes , which we do not understand .",
    "we did rotate the spectrograph to align the slit with the parallactic angle whenever the zenith distance was substantial , so differential refraction is not the culprit .",
    "we obtained images of pg 1224 + 309 during the interval 1998 may 5 - 13 with the kpno 0.9 m telescope , which was equipped with the t2ka @xmath29 ccd at both the f/13.5 focus ( may 5 - 8 ) and the f/7 focus ( may 9 - 13 ) .",

    "we used the programs daophot iie , allstar and daomaster ( stetson 1987 ; stetson , davis , & crabtree 1991 ; stetson 1992a , b ) to compute the photometric time series of pg 1224 + 309 and five nearby field stars .",
    "the observations of the landolt standard stars were used to derive the transformation from daomaster instrumental magnitudes to the standard scales .",

    "blue spectra of pg  @xmath106 were obtained with the 3 m shane telescope and kast spectrograph ( miller & stone 1993 ) at lick observatory on 1998 may 22 ut and again on 1998 june 23 ut . on each occasion",
    "the star was observed for approximately 2 hours during which a set of eight 15-minute exposures was obtained , covering about 1/3 of the orbital cycle .",
    "the purpose was to measure the radial velocity curve of the white dwarf from the high - order balmer lines in its spectrum , so the observations were planned to sample a different part of the orbital cycle of the system on each run .",
    "the spectra cover the range 32004550    with a spectral resolution of 2.8   .",
    "they were obtained through a @xmath107 slit using an 830  mm@xmath3 grism . the seeing varied between @xmath108 and @xmath107 over the course of the observations resulting in a variable loss of light at the slit jaws . moreover , since the star had to be followed through a fairly high airmass , some spectra suffer from additional light losses at the shortest wavelengths because of differential atmospheric refraction , in spite of our efforts to keep the slit at the parallactic angle .",
    "a log of the observations is included in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the spectra were reduced in a standard manner , as described earlier , although we used our own reduction software while making only limited use of the iraf software package . in the final individual spectra , the signal - to - noise ratio at 4200    ranges between 15 and 25 .",
    "the wavelength scale was originally derived from spectra of arc lamps obtained at the beginning of each sequence of object spectra .",
    "the wavelength scales of individual spectra were then refined by using the emission - line spectra of the night sky recorded during the same exposure to measure small _ relative _ offsets and rectifying them . as a result of this procedure ,",
    "the _ relative _ velocity scales of individual spectra agree to 8  km  s@xmath3 or better .",
    "we used the set of spectra from mdm to determine the spectroscopic period since the time coverage for these data is by far the longest .",
    "the mdm spectra ( discussed later ) showed a narrow , variable h@xmath0 emission line superposed on a strong white dwarf spectrum of type da ( see also orosz , wade , & harlow 1997 ) . for 33 spectra with adequate signal - to - noise , we fitted this feature with a gaussian , adjusting approximately for the sloping baseline caused by the white dwarf absorption .",
    "table [ tab2 ] gives the resulting radial velocities . a gaussian - convolution algorithm ( schneider & young 1980 ) gave similar results , but with slightly greater scatter around the best fit ( below ) .",
    "we searched for periods by constructing a highly oversampled grid of trial frequencies spanning 0 to 8 cycles d@xmath3 , fitting a least - squares sinusoid to the velocities at each frequency , and plotting the inverse of the fit variance as a function of frequency to form a ` residual - gram ' ( thorstensen et al .",
    "this method works well when the modulation is sinusoidal and its amplitude exceeds the observational uncertainty .",

    "a least - squares sinusoid fit of the form @xmath109\\ ] ] gave @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the uncertainty of a single measurement inferred from the goodness - of - fit , and the uncertainties are formal 1-@xmath111 errors .",
    "discarding the two worst - fitting points changed @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and @xmath111 to @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 km s@xmath3 respectively , but did not significantly affect the ephemeris .",

    "the sinusoid shown has been fitted to all but the two worst points .",
    "we adopt @xmath2 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the h@xmath0 emission fits also produced estimates of the equivalent width ( ew ) .",
    "these were noisier than the radial velocities , but showed a strong modulation at the same period .",
    "a sinusoidal fit to the ew time series , with the period fixed at the more accurately - determined radial velocity period , showed that the ew modulation lags in phase behind the radial velocities by @xmath117 cycle .",
    "this is nicely consistent with the 0.25-cycle lag expected if the emission line arises on the side of the normal star facing the white dwarf ( thorstensen et al .",
    "1978 ; vennes & thorstensen 1994 ) . the upper panel of figure [ t2 ] shows the equivalent widths folded on the best period , together with a sinusoidal fit with a half - amplitude of @xmath118   and a mean of @xmath119   ( formal error ) .",
    "the sinusoidal fit is only fiducial , as the modulation may not be strictly sinusoidal ( thorstensen et al .",
    "1978 ) , and our ew accuracy and sampling are not sufficient for us to detect small deviations from a sinusoid . in any case , the deep modulation of the equivalent widths , and the accurate agreement of the phase offset with the illumination model , make it very likely that the bulk of the h@xmath0 emission arises from fluorescence on the illuminated face of the normal star .",
    "it is possible that the m dwarf also has intrinsic h@xmath0 emission , but it apparently does not dominate .",

    "the model white dwarf spectrum has @xmath7 k and @xmath8 and contributes 97% of the light at 4500    and virtually all of the light blueward of 3800   .",
    "our values of @xmath177 and @xmath176 are the same within the errors as those found by liebert & bergeron .",
    "thus we adopt @xmath8 for the discussion below .      having knowledge of the orbital ephemeris , we searched in the red spectra for the contribution of the m star and for any variations of its spectrum with orbital phase .",

    "unfortunately , only a single spectrum fell in the bin nearest inferior conjunction of the m star .",
    "nonetheless , a heating effect is clearly seen . in the lowermost spectrum ( inferior conjunction ) , the characteristic bumpy continuum of an m dwarf is strongly present ; it is less pronounced , though quite obvious , in the quadrature phases .",
    "however , in the spectrum showing the largest portion of the illuminated face ( third from bottom ) , the m - dwarf contribution is not obvious despite good signal - to - noise .",
    "evidently the spectrum of the illuminated face is of earlier type than the unilluminated face ( or is otherwise lacking strong molecular bands ) , so that the bands in the observed spectrum are greatly diluted .",
    "the illumination of the m star is discussed further below .    to quantify the spectral contribution of the secondary star and",
    "estimate its type , we prepared an average of the eight large - format spectra taken within 0.2 cycle of inferior conjunction .",
    "we then systematically scaled and subtracted spectra from a library of m dwarfs .",
    "these stars were observed with the same instrumental setup , and have classifications from boeshaar ( 1976 ) .",
    "we examined the subtracted spectra looking for good cancellation of the m - dwarf features .",
    "types m3 and earlier tended to leave a strong oversubtraction of the d lines when the scale factor was set to cancel the bands in the 65007500   region , and the bands themselves did not cancel well .",
    "a spectrum of type m5 did not subtract satisfactorily .",
    "the only acceptable results were from two stars classified as m4 + ( boeshaar 1976 ) or m4.5 ( henry , kirkpatrick , & simons 1994 ) .",
    "figure [ t4 ] shows the best decomposition .",
    "we conclude that the intrinsic spectrum of the m dwarf is most probably a little later than m4 , and that the flux contributed at this phase by the unilluminated part of the m dwarf is @xmath186 erg @xmath187 s@xmath3 @xmath3 at 6500  , or 1520 percent of the light at that wavelength .",
    "the calibration uncertainties discussed earlier should not seriously affect these conclusions , since the features cover a fairly limited wavelength range . for",
    "comparison , orosz , wade , & harlow ( 1997 ) adopted a spectral type of m1m3 with a contribution of 10% over the region 53206532   , based on two low signal - to - noise spectra obtained near orbital phases 0.89 and 0.53 .",
    "very few features are seen in the spectrum aside from the contributions discussed above .",
    "there is weak emission present at @xmath188 , apparently also modulated by the illumination phase .",
    "this feature is fairly often seen in cataclysmic binaries , where it is usually attributed to fe ii ( taylor & thorstensen 1996 ) .",
    "curiously , there is very little he i emission ; he i is conspicuous ( though weaker than the balmer lines ) in the illumination - effect stars feige 24 ( thorstensen et al .  1978 ) and euve 2013 + 400 ( thorstensen et al .  1994 ) .",
    "because the h@xmath0 emission line arises mostly from one hemisphere of the m dwarf , its velocity amplitude is likely to underestimate the star s center - of - mass motion . to account for this effect we tried to measure velocities of the m dwarf by cross - correlation methods , using our m dwarf library spectra ( some of which have very accurate velocities from marcy et al .",
    "1987 ) as templates .",
    "unfortunately , the signal - to - noise ratio of the available spectra proved inadequate for this purpose .",
    "knowing the surface gravity of the white dwarf in pg 1224 + 309 enables us to estimate its mass .",
    "the mass  radius relation for white dwarf stars does depend on the composition of the white dwarf and its position along the cooling track .",

    "adopting a plausible value for @xmath205 ( based partly on the radii of the components of cm dra , which has a similar spectral type ) leads to an estimate of @xmath198 that is consistent with the more massive component of cm dra .",
    "this is consistent , if slightly circular reasoning , but it suggests that the inclination of the binary orbit plane is fairly high . to avoid eclipses , however , @xmath223 must not be too high , and thus higher stellar masses are favored , in order to account for the observed radial velocity amplitudes .    an alternate method of estimating the mass uses an empirical mass - luminosity relation for m dwarfs , as follows . from the white dwarf s @xmath177 and @xmath176 and assuming @xmath248 ( @xmath249 ) we find @xmath250 ( althaus & benvenuto 1997 ) , and thus @xmath251 .",

    "the m star s mass inferred by this method is slightly higher ( by @xmath263 ) if the white dwarf s hydrogen layer mass is @xmath264 , because the higher white dwarf mass ( @xmath265 , benvenuto & althaus 1998 ) implies a slightly larger radius for the white dwarf ( at fixed gravity ) , hence higher luminosities for both stars .",
    "either value of @xmath198 is consistent with the orbit - based mass estimate .    as an aside",
    ", we can compute the distance to the system .",
    "the @xmath34 magnitude of the system at phase 0.0 ( when the contribution of the heated face of the m star is minimal ) is @xmath266 .",
    "the white dwarf contributes 84% of the light in @xmath34 , hence the apparent @xmath34 magnitude of the white dwarf by itself is @xmath267 .",
    "the distance is then @xmath268 pc ( @xmath269 white dwarf ) or @xmath270 pc ( @xmath265 white dwarf ) .",
    "the light curves described above show no obvious eclipses and are nearly sinusoidal .",
    "they are thus consistent with a very simple picture of the light modulation in pg 1224 + 309 being due to phase - dependent visibility of the bright , inward - facing hemisphere of a nearly spherical secondary star , which is uniformly emitting as a consequence of strong heating by the white dwarf . if one were sure of the radiative properties of both illuminated and unilluminated sides of the m dwarf ( i.e. , if one knew the surface fluxes and limb - darkening coefficients in each color ) , one could model the light curves to infer constraints on the radius of the m dwarf and on the inclination .",
    "such radiative quantities are becoming available for normal , unilluminated photospheres of low - luminosity stars ( cf .",
    "claret 1998 for limb - darkening coefficients based on the next - gen model atmospheres of hauschildt et al .",
    "1998 ) . for the strongly illuminated hemisphere ,",
    "however , neither surface fluxes nor limb - darkening behavior is known . treating the problem by assuming that the atmosphere behaves `` normally ,",
    "'' i.e.  with standard albedo and limb - darkening coefficients at an enhanced effective temperature , is not adequate for making robust conclusions regarding the secondary star ( cf.hilditch et al .",
    "1996 , who review problems of light - curve synthesis for strongly irradiated stars , including the formal finding of limb-_brightening _ in their analysis of the systems aa dor and kv vel ) .    in view of this difficulty ,",
    "we are content here to check whether the light curve amplitudes can be approximately reproduced , using properties of the stars and the binary orbit consistent with our prior discussion , and without requiring such an extreme inclination as to introduce an eclipse or other large distortion .",
    "essentially , the question reduces to whether the pair of quantities @xmath223 and @xmath271 that is needed to model the light curves is consistent with the properties of pg 1224 + 309 as known from the discussion given above . for this purpose ,",
    "a simplified treatment using blackbody emissivities ( at the local effective temperature ) and a limb - darkening law appropriate for ( unilluminated ) cool photospheres _ may _ be adequate .",
    "we used the wilson ",

    "the bolometric albedos for reflection heating and re - radiation were set to 1.0 and 0.5 , respectively . for definiteness , a limb - darkening law was used that includes a logarithmic term and took the appropriate coefficients for the four filters from the tables in van hamme ( 1993 ) . in the w ",

    "d code to roughly match the observed light - curve amplitudes for plausible values of @xmath223 , @xmath197 and @xmath278 is regarded as confirmation of the basic picture we have of pg 1224 + 309 .      without the benefit of eclipses ,",
    "how can accurate masses of the component stars of pg 1224 + 309 be derived ?",
    "additional observables include the m star s rotational velocity @xmath279 and a direct measurement of @xmath280 from absorption lines .",
    "the rotational velocity could be exploited , assuming synchronous rotation , to form the ratio @xmath281 where @xmath282 is the size of the m star s orbit around the center of mass .",
    "an absorption line velocity curve , depending on the lines used , would give an estimate of @xmath280 requiring a `` k - correction '' of the opposite sign to that used here .    additional information",
    "could be extracted from the light curves , given improved theoretical modeling of irradiated atmospheres , to be incorporated into light - curve synthesis codes . in particular ,",
    "believable light - curve amplitudes could be used to specify the radius of the m star , relative to the orbital separation , as a function of the orbital inclination .",
    "consistency between inferred mass and radius could then be demanded , to sharply limit the allowed range of inclination .    in principle",
    ", one could measure the gravitational redshift of the white dwarf which would provide an independent constraint on the mass and radius of the white dwarf .",
    "the gravitational redshift would simply be the difference in the two @xmath113 values for the orbital solutions of the two components .",
    "currently , the measured @xmath113 values are not known well enough , both in terms of formal statistical errors and in terms of systematic errors , to enable a meaningful measurement of the gravitational redshift ( @xmath283 km s@xmath3 and @xmath284 km s@xmath3 ; statistical errors are quoted ) .",
    "the balmer lines have sharp emission features in their cores , which complicates the measurement of @xmath157 .",
    "possibly the white dwarf has metal absorption lines in the ultraviolet , in which case a spaced - based measurement of @xmath157 might be possible .",
    "finally , some improvement in the measurement of @xmath147 might be achieved from additional spectroscopy covering the entire orbital cycle .",
    "the present orbital separation of pg 1224 + 309 is @xmath285 .",
    "the present white dwarf was once the core of a giant star with a radius of @xmath286 and therefore @xmath287 formerly .",
    "the standard picture of how such initially wide binaries can be drastically reduced in orbital size is the so - called `` common envelope '' ( ce ) process . very roughly , in this picture the envelope of the growing giant star engulfs the companion star , and orbital energy is lost due to friction against the envelope , leading to the possible ejection of the envelope .",
    "iben & livio ( 1993 ) present a well - organized and relatively recent review of the ce process and the stellar evolution scenarios and products involving it .",
    "livio ( 1996 ) reviews how observations can further constrain the ce scenarios .",
    "the ce phase is very short - lived , and it unlikely to be observed directly , but post - ce binaries such as pg 1224 + 309 have the potential to illuminate some aspects of the ce process .",
    "one question of interest is whether a rule can be given for terminating the decay of the binary orbit  does the decay continue until essentially all material outside the ( pre - white dwarf ) `` core '' of the giant star has been expelled , and if so what is the mass of the residual hydrogen envelope ? in pg 1224 + 309 , @xmath199 as inferred from @xmath177 and @xmath176 is ambiguous at the @xmath288 level , unless the hydrogen envelope mass @xmath289 is known .",
    "given an estimate of @xmath199 , however , we can infer @xmath198 along with the orbital inclination , from @xmath205 and the mass ratio . with our best estimate of @xmath205 , the lack of",
    "eclipses favors a higher white dwarf mass , hence a relatively thick hydrogen envelope .",
    "pg 1224 + 309 misses being an eclipsing system by only a few degrees ! eclipses would provide additional constraints on the mass and radius of the white dwarf .",
    "it would then be possible to infer @xmath289 with high confidence .",
    "this would be a new and valuable piece of information with which to confront common - envelope theories .",
    "systems like pg 1224 + 309 can also sometimes be used to study the efficiency of the common envelope process .",
    "this is usually parameterized by the parameter @xmath290 , which relates the initial and final orbits to the energy expended in ejecting the ce .",
    "the efficiency thus helps to determine the mapping of initial binary periods onto final ( post - ce ) periods . except for the ambiguity in @xmath199 , pg1224",
    "+ 309 would be a useful system in potentially giving a lower limit to @xmath290 .",
    "the argument is as follows .",
    "the decay of the orbit must have released enough energy to overcome the binding energy of the envelope that formerly blanketed the white dwarf .",
    "the supply of orbital energy can be estimated from the present separation and masses ( there is little dependence on the initial separation ) , and the present mass of the white dwarf gives the radius of its giant star progenitor at the moment that dynamical timescale mass transfer began ( _ via _ the giant branch core - mass  luminosity relation ) .",
    "that radius , combined with an estimate of the envelope mass , gives the binding energy of the envelope .",
    "the ratio defines @xmath290 : @xmath291 or @xmath292 using the definitions of webbink ( 1984 ) as given in livio ( 1996 ) . here",
    "@xmath293 and @xmath294 are the initial masses , @xmath295 is the core or remnant mass of the more evolved star , @xmath296 and @xmath297 are the original and final orbital separations , @xmath298 is the radius of the evolved star s original roche lobe expressed as a fraction of @xmath296 , and @xmath299 is a structure factor for that star s envelope .",
    "the calculated value of @xmath290 depends strongly on the assumed core mass @xmath300 .",
    "for pg 1224 + 309 , we first consider the case where @xmath301 , @xmath302 , and @xmath303 .",
    "then the available orbital energy was about @xmath304 in solar units with @xmath305 .",
    "here we neglect the small second term on the r.h.s . of the displayed equation . for assumed initial masses of @xmath306 , 1.2 , and 1.4 @xmath307 , the radius of the star when it contacted its roche lobe and began mass transfer leading to the common envelope was @xmath308 , 71 , or 68  @xmath309 ( using approximations from tout et al .",
    "the binding energy of the envelope was approximately @xmath310 , @xmath311 , and @xmath312 , respectively .",
    "with these assumptions , the available orbital energy exceeded the binding energy only if @xmath293 was less than 1.4  @xmath307 , and even then most of the orbital energy was needed to unbind the envelope ; thus @xmath290 can not have been significantly less then unity .",
    "( stars with values of @xmath293 much smaller than those considered are less likely to have evolved so far yet .",
    "also , for @xmath313 , which corresponds to a luminosity well below the tip of the red giant branch , mass loss on the giant branch is not likely to have been significant . ) by this example we have shown how , in principle , observations of relatively wide post - ce binaries ( with small negative orbital energies ) set a lower limit on @xmath290 .",
    "however , in the specific case of pg 1224 + 309 , the ambiguity in @xmath199 owing to our ignorance of @xmath289 makes this particular test less interesting .",
    "this is because increasing @xmath199 to @xmath314 reduces the pre - ce binding energy greatly and thus reduces the lower limit on @xmath290 .",
    "finding _ eclipsing _ , double - lined da+dm systems may in favorable cases provide firmer constraints on @xmath290 .",
    "analogous eclipsing systems would allow better constraints to be placed on the component masses _ and _ radii , which would in turn allow one to begin addressing additional questions , such as whether post - ce secondaries satisfy a normal main sequence mass - radius relation .",
    "pg 1224 + 309 is a post - ce binary , as discussed above , and is also a pre - cataclysmic binary in the sense of ritter ( 1986 ) : the orbital separation @xmath315 will shrink owing to gravitation wave radiation ( gwr ) until the m star contacts its roche lobe and initiates mass transfer onto the white dwarf .",
    "( angular momentum loss _ via _ magnetic braking , another process considered by ritter , is thought not to operate for low - mass m dwarfs . ) using formulae from ritter ( 1986 ) and adopting @xmath316 and @xmath317 , it will take about @xmath318  years for gwr to bring pg 1224 + 309 into a semidetached configuration , at which time the orbital period will be 2.5 hours .",
    "the present cooling age of the white dwarf is perhaps a few @xmath319  years ( althaus & benvenuto 1997 ) , but when roche - lobe overflow ( rlof ) mass transfer begins the white dwarf will have cooled to well below @xmath320",
    "we have measured the orbital period of pg 1224 + 309 to be @xmath1 days . the semi - amplitude of the white dwarf s radial velocity curve is @xmath6 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the velocity semi - amplitude of the h@xmath0 emission line arising from the irradiated hemisphere of the m star is @xmath321 km s@xmath3 .",

    "the implied mass ratio is then @xmath322 .",
    "the spectral type of the secondary is m4 + .",
    "we fit synthetic spectra to the blue spectrum and find @xmath190 k and @xmath8 for the white dwarf .",
    "the white dwarf contributes 97% of the light at 4500    and virtually all of the light blueward of 3800   .",
    "the mass inferred for the white dwarf depends on the assumed mass of the thin residual hydrogen envelope : @xmath323 for hydrogen envelope masses in the range @xmath324 .",
    "given the absence of eclipses , for likely values of @xmath205 and based on the observed values of @xmath147 and @xmath280 , we conclude that the mass of the white dwarf is closer to @xmath11 .",
    "it thus appears that the white dwarf has a relatively large residual hydrogen envelope .",
    "the mass of the m star is @xmath12 if @xmath325 km s@xmath3 and @xmath326 . in this case , the inclination is @xmath13 , only a few degrees away from giving rise to eclipses .",
