    "the turing mechanism for reaction - diffusion equations models biological and chemical pattern formations .",
    "this approach was widely discussed in literature and supported by many numerical examples ( see the recent books @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and many works cited therein ) .",
    "patterns of different symmetries may arise after solution to reaction - diffusion equations .",
    "hexagonal arrays , layers and their perturbations are observed in different models after numerical solution to the corresponding initial - boundary value problems for nonlinear partial differential equations .",
    "however , these models do not answer the question , why the most frequently observed patterns are close to the optimal packing structures .",
    "why do the hexagonal array arise ?",
    "one can see , for instance , that a resulting structure can be the hexagonal array disturbed by pentagon inclusions .",
    "is it related to a model approximation or to an inherent feature of pattern formations ?    in the present paper ,",
    "we try to answer the above questions to demonstrate an intimate connection between pattern formations and optimal random packing on the plane .",
    "the main study is based on the following two points .",
    "first , the diffusive flux in reaction - diffusion systems is approximated by piecewise linear functions in the framework of structural approximations @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this leads to a discrete network approximation of the considered continuous problem .",
    "second , the discrete energy minimization yields optimal random packing of the domains in the representative cell .",
    "the packed domains are approximated by equal disks .",
    "these approach is described in the bulk of the paper .",
    "packing problems refers to geometrical optimization problems @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we consider the optimal packing of disks on the plane in the random statement fitted to the description of pattern formations .",
    "optimal packing in the classic deterministic statement is attained for the hexagonal array when the packing concentration holds @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "computer simulations demonstrate that random packing have a lower density and depends on the protocol of the random packing .",
    "it is shown in sec.[secm33 ] that pattern formations lead to the optimal random packing problem . in the present paper , this problem is resolved by introduction of the equivalence classes of graphs obtained form the delaunay triangulation associated to packings .",
    "the justification of such an approach is based on the observation that solution to the physical problem of the optimal diffusion implies solution to the geometrical problem of the packing disks @xcite .",
    "the unique optimal solution is constructed in each class of the random packings .",
    "if the number of disks per representative cell is finite , the number of classes of isomorphic graphs , hence , the number of optimal packings is also finite .    the proposed method to study pattern formations",
    "is based on the investigation of graph structures by analytical and numerical methods without treatment of pde .",
    "the turing mechanism can create temporally stable and spatially non - homogeneous structures . in order to present the main idea of the structural approximation we consider 1d schnakenberg system @xcite .",
    "a typical dependence of the inhibitor on the spatial variable is displayed in fig.[fig : bio1]a .",
    "it is assumed that such a dependence can be approximated by a piecewise linear function as shown in fig.[fig : bio1]b .     and",

    "a similar approximation can be extended to multidimensional reaction - diffusion equations @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we deal with 2d double periodic structures .",
    "let @xmath3 and @xmath4 be the translation vectors of the lattice @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes the set of integer numbers . consider the periodic representative cell @xmath7 for simplicity , we approximate the places of maximal diffusion potential by equal disks @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) of radius @xmath10 centered at the set of points @xmath11 displayed in fig.[fig : bio4 ] . the maxima of the diffusion potential are approximated by disks and the minima by segments .",

    "the delauney triangulation of the vertices @xmath24 consists of straight lines connecting by pairs points of @xmath24 belonging to neighbor voronoi regions .",
    "let the neighborhood relation between two vertexes be denoted by @xmath27 or shortly @xmath28 .",
    "we call the constructed double periodic graph @xmath29 by the delaunay graph .",
    "two graphs are called isomorphic if they contain the same number of vertices connected in the same way .",
    "one of the most important notation of the persent paper is the class of graphs @xmath30 isomorphic to the given graph @xmath29 .",
    "let @xmath31 denote the vector whose components are the maximal diffusion potentials in the corresponding disks .",
    "the discrete network model for densely packed disks @xcite , @xcite , @xcite is based on the fact that the diffusion flux is concentrated in the necks between closely spaced inclusions having different potentials . in our model ,",

    "keller s formula was deduced for the linear local diffusion flux between the neighbor disks that is agree with our approximation .",
