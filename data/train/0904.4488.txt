    "pressure is a thermodynamic variable that can be used to perturb and , hopefully , understand phase transitions . in the case of the recently discovered families of feas - based superconductors pressure has been particularly powerful .",
    "the application of pressure on polycrystalline lafeas(o / f ) raised the onset of the superconducting transition from 26  k to 43  k @xcite and the substitution of heavier rare earths for la achieved even larger ambient pressure increases in t@xmath1 to 55 k via the lanthanide contraction ( chemical pressure ) @xcite .",
    "even pure lafeaso has been found to superconduct with a maximum t@xmath1=21  k for a 120  kbar pressure @xcite .",
    "after the discovery of superconductivity in k - doped aefe@xmath0as@xmath0 ( ae = ba and sr ) @xcite , cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 was discovered as a new member of the aefe@xmath0as@xmath0 series and found to have the smallest lattice parameters @xcite .",
    "the application of pressure to cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 using self clamping cells with liquid media lead to the discovery of superconductivity for p @xmath2 5 kbar @xcite .",
    "subsequent work with he - medium cells @xcite demonstrated that ( i ) these materials are not only exceptionally pressure sensitive , but can also be very sensitive to strain and ( ii ) in the case of cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 , where there is a pressure stabilized collapsed tetragonal phase at low temperatures for p @xmath3 5 kbar , the combination of a solidified pressure medium and a first order , structural phase transition leads to a multi - crystallographic phase at low temperatures with the superconductivity most likely coming from a remaining orthorhombic or even high temperature tetragonal phases .",
    "subsequent studies of the effects of pressure on srfe@xmath0as@xmath0 and bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 have found that the higher temperature , structural / antiferromagnetic phase transition is much less pressure sensitive and that much higher pressures are needed to stabilize superconductivity , but there is poor agreement between the differing measurements , using differing pressure environments , often measuring only the upper , structural / antiferromagnetic or the lower , superconducting , phase line @xcite .",
    "in addition , strain stabilized superconductivity seems to be an ubiquitous feature of all of the aefe@xmath0as@xmath0 materials @xcite .    in this paper we assemble and present pressure - temperature phase diagrams for bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 and srfe@xmath0as@xmath0 using a liquid medium modified bridgman cell configuration to measure temperature and pressure dependent electrical resistivity of multiple samples of each compound .",
    "we are able to determine both the pressure dependence of the upper , structural / antiferromagnetic phase transition , as well as the lower , superconducting phase .",
    "we have found that whereas there is a broad region of partial superconductivity ( not even completely filamentary ) that gives rise to a partial electrical shorting of the sample , zero resistivity exists over a smaller pressure range that is centered on the extrapolated termination of the higher temperature structural / antiferromagnetic phase transition line .",
    "the srfe@xmath0as@xmath0 and bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 samples studied here were single crystals grown out of tin @xcite , and feas flux @xcite respectively .",
    "electrical resistivity was measured by a four - probe method .",
    "samples were cleaved and then cut to appropriate dimensions ( typically 700 @xmath4 150 @xmath4 30  @xmath5 ) for high pressure studies .",
    "four 12.5  @xmath6 diameter gold wires were fixed with silver epoxy in the ( _ a_,_b _ ) plane .",
    "we performed resistivity measurements under pressures of up to 76 kbar with a bridgman cell modified to use a liquid pressure medium @xcite ; a fluorinert mixture 1:1 fc70:fc77 was chosen in the present case .",
    "the pressure was determined at low temperature by the superconducting temperature transition of a lead sample @xcite .",
    "the top and side views of such a pressure chamber are represented in figure [ cellb2 ] both as a photograph and as a schematic .",
    "all temperature and field dependent measurements were performed in a quantum design physical property measurement system ( ppms ) .",
    "a standard ppms sample puck was fixed to a small pressure cell ( 23  mm diameter , 60  mm length , and 130  g mass ) .",
    "no thermometers were placed on the pressure cell .",
    "we chose a measurement current of 1  ma , although we measured the superconducting transitions for different currents : 1  ma , 0.1  ma and sometimes 0.01  ma , as needed .",
    "the magnetic field dependence of the superconducting transition was measured up to 14 t , with field along the _ c _ axis of the samples . the typical pressure variations between ambient and low temperature",
    "were previously estimated to be lower than 1  kbar , by fitting our lead data with a bloch - grneisen law as proposed eiling and schilling @xcite .",
    "measurements between 40 and 300  k were performed at constant cooling or heating rates .",
    "the comparison between subsequent measurements of the resistivity of a lead sample measured first inside and then outside of the pressure cell ( filled with 1:1 fc70:fc77 ) at ambient pressure gave us an estimate of the temperature shift between the ppms sample thermometer and the temperature of our pressurized samples .",
    "the comparison under pressure for the resistivity difference between warming and cooling gave similar results .",
    "a cooling rate of 1  k / min results in a nearly uniform temperature shift lower than 3  k between around 290 and 80  k. we used a slower temperature sweep of 0.5  k / min during warming for more precise measurements . in this case , the shift between the real pressure cell temperature and the measured one is still nearly uniform and was estimated to be lower than 1.2  k. most of the data shown in figures [ cell ] and [ cellba ] were obtained on warming at a rate of 0.5  k / min . for temperatures below 40  k ,",
    "a 0.2 k / min rate results in a temperature shift lower than 100  mk . to precisely measure the low temperature , superconducting transitions of the lead and the sample ,",
    "the temperature was stabilized before the measurement of each data point .",
    "no shift in the data between cooling and warming was observed by proceeding this way .",
    "three pressure cells with srfe@xmath0as@xmath0 samples and two with bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 samples were measured so as to check the reproducibility of their behavior under pressure . for these pressure cells , measured down to low temperatures up to high pressures , we were not able to gently remove the sample after the final measurement .",
    "( the gasket would break on decompression , resulting in the loss of the sample .",
    "some details about ruptures during unloads are given by colombier and braithwaite @xcite . ) to show that the pressure conditions were not harmful for the samples , we applied to a srfe@xmath0as@xmath0 sample a pressure estimated to be around 50  kbar .",
    "this pressure cell was not measured at low temperature , but was kept at 300  k for one night before careful and successful unloading .",
    "the comparison at ambient pressure , before and after the load on this srfe@xmath0as@xmath0 sample is shown in figure [ beforafterload ] .",
    "the general behavior remains the same and the resistance did nt increase after the pressure unload compared to before , indicating that no cracks or irreversible defects appeared .",
    "some silver paste was added to the sample contacts , weakened during the unload , which might explain the slight differences between the curves .",
    "the distance between voltage wires became indeed around 10  @xmath7  smaller , which could have increased the relative contribution of tin , and might have also caused the difference between the two curves , around the structural transition temperature .",
    "we may however worry that the measured samples could be damaged during cooling , because of thermal contractions of the pressure cell , even if the pressure variations estimated are low .",
    "moreover , when the structural transition occurs , the sample dimensions may suddenly change by a few percent ( in particular along the _ a _ and _ b _ axes @xcite ) and it will be strained by a solidified ( frozen ) medium .",
    "this was underlined in the case of cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 from studies using pressure mediums presenting different hydrostatic conditions @xcite . as can be seen in figure [ leadtransition ] ,",
    "good hydrostatic conditions can be inferred from the narrow superconducting transition of the lead , even though the pressure medium has frozen by this temperature .",
    "the pressure gradients between voltage wires , estimated from the superconducting width ( between the true onset and the zero - resistivity temperatures ) , are less than 0.6 kbar at 56.8 kbar .",
    "( this corresponds to a 20  mk superconducting transition width , which is relatively small . ) for the higher pressures , we obtain typical widths from 20 to 40  mk .",
    "some typical values of pressure gradient estimations and other tests regarding the pressure quality are given by colombier and braithwaite @xcite .",
    "samples were characterized at ambient pressure by resistivity measurement between 2 and 300  k. the typical residual resistivity ratio was @xmath8 for srfe@xmath0as@xmath0 and around 2.6 for bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 .",
    "some differences were observed between the srfe@xmath0as@xmath0 samples , specifically for the low temperature behavior . in particular , we noticed in many samples a kink around 21.5  k ( clearly shown in the inset of figure [ beforafterload ] ) , with an amplitude ranging from a few percent to 75  @xmath7 of the resistivity value . this anomaly has been observed at ambient pressure by several groups @xcite .",
    "it is attributed to small regions of superconductivity and may be created by internal strains @xcite .",
    "some samples also presented a partial superconducting transition , at around 3.7  k , due to the presence of tin flux ( again shown in the inset of figure [ beforafterload ] ) .",
    "we avoided such tin - contaminated samples for high pressure measurements .",
    "we observe the changes under pressure in the resistive signature of the transition attributed to the combined structural and antiferromagnetic transition , up to around 30 and 40  kbar respectively for srfe@xmath0as@xmath0 and bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 .",
    "whereas both compounds manifest a similarly shaped resistive signature at ambient pressure , a small , sharp , but clearly detectable , local maxima is seen just above the loss of resistivity under pressure for bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 samples but not for srfe@xmath0as@xmath0 ( as can be seen in figures [ cell ] and [ cellba ] below ) .",
    "this feature may be attributed to a superzone gap opening and the fact that it is only observed in some of the samples may be due to in - plane anisotropy @xcite .",
    "however , this feature seems to be linked to the samples batches much more than to the compound .",
    "although we did nt observe any such feature in the three srfe@xmath0as@xmath0 samples measured , kotegawa _ et al . _",
    "@xcite saw this feature under pressure for their sn - grown single crystals of srfe@xmath0as@xmath0 . by carefully examining resistivity curves from our samples and from other srfe@xmath0as@xmath0 studies @xcite",
    ", it seems that this feature develops under pressure only for samples presenting already a sharp peak of small amplitude ( less than 1  % ) at ambient pressure . in our bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 samples ,",
    "such a peak was also observed at ambient pressure for most of the samples measured .",
    "figure [ cell ] presents temperature dependent resistivity under pressure for two different srfe@xmath0as@xmath0 samples .",
    "the difference between the 300  k resistivity values at ambient pressure is most likely due to a combination of uncertainty in determination of sample dimensions ( up to ten percent in the basal plane and up to 30 percent for the thickness ) and cracks or defects induced while cleaving the samples , which might change the current path .",
    "the relative resistivity decrease at ambient temperature is shown in figure [ r300ksr ] for our two srfe@xmath0as@xmath0 samples . for comparison , low pressure data using a piston - cylinder cell @xcite were added .",
    "the three sets of measurements are in a quite good agreement . if any damage occurs to the samples during the temperature cycle it results in small resistivity differences compared to the pressure induced changes .",
    "we observed a resistivity decrease in a monotonic and essentially linear fashion with pressure , with a close to a factor 2.5 decrease between 0 and 65  kbar .",
    "the drop in resistance that is associated with the combined structural and antiferromagnetic transitions , is observed around 202  k at ambient pressure .",
    "the transition , relatively sharp at ambient pressure , is shifted to lower temperatures and becomes broader and less pronounced as the pressure is increased .",
    "we could not observe it clearly for pressures higher than 30  kbar .",
    "when we apply pressure , a kink appears at 37.6  k. as pressure is increased , it becomes more pronounced and for pressures higher than 29  kbar the kink becomes a complete transition to zero resistivity .",
    "this transition progressively becomes narrower up to around 35 kbar . for higher applied pressures",
    "it is then broadens again and shifted down to lower temperatures .",
    "the low pressure kink at low temperature has been observed previously by torikachvili _",
    "@xcite but as described above , it did not become a clear transition to a zero - resistivity state by the maximum applied pressure of 19 kbar .",
    "its transition temperature is in very good agreement with the one we observed at ambient pressure for the sample measured in cell 1 .",
    "up to 16  kbar , the onset temperature of this feature remains relatively constant and at 18.9  kbar , there is an increase in the onset temperature of this feature .",

    "the onset temperature of the down - turn in resistivity ( the kink ) was chosen as t@xmath1 .",

    "the resistivity data from two different samples are shown for comparison .",
    "for both sets of measurements , we observe an evolution of the resistive signature of the ambient pressure 130  k structural / antiferromagnetic phase transition with pressure . for low pressure",
