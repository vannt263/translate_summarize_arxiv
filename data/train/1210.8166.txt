    "correlating this observation with electroweak precision data   and measurements in the @xmath6 channels , which constrain the particle s couplings to massive gauge bosons , we infer from fits to the data   ( most notably by the atlas themselves  ) that the particle reproduces sm higgs properties within 1 - 2@xmath3 .",

    "this phase space region is mostly sensitive to modifications of the @xmath206 coupling and the modified trilinear @xmath86 vertex . at large @xmath207",

    "the relatively larger increase of the one jet - inclusive cross section can be understood along the following lines .",
    "the additional top partners introduce a new mass scale to the one - loop amplitude . at large transverse momentum ,",
    "the cross section is dominated by continuum @xmath16 production which mostly proceeds via box diagrams in addition to initial radiation .",
    "the latter is increased as a result of the newly introduced mass scale in comparison to the sm , and initial state radiation allows the initial state partons to access the large valence quark parton distributions .",
    "this effect is also visible in the nlo predictions of @xmath201 in composite models employing the effective theory approximation  @xcite .",
    "the composite higgs scenario is a well - motivated model of electroweak symmetry breaking that is consistent with current flavor constraints and direct searches for heavy top partners .",
    "furthermore , composite higgs models typically predict a large enhanced di - higgs cross section , which is further enhanced in for @xmath214 final state by the introducing a new mass scale to the phenomenology . while small di - higgs(+jet )",
    "rates in the context of the sm might hinder a determination of the sm higgs potential in case no further indications of physics beyond the sm become available , composite di - higgs production will overcome this shortcoming due to its large production cross section .",
    "consequently , also for extremely heavy top partners , di - higgs(+jet ) production is going to provide a powerful test of higgs compositeness at the lhc .",
    "a precise determination of the realization of higgs mechanism _",
    "sui generis _ is an important task that has to be pursued at the lhc , especially after the recent discovery of an sm higgs - like particle . while measurements based on single higgs boson production provide only indirect constraints on the realization of electroweak symmetry breaking ,",
    "the partial experimental reconstruction of the higgs potential is indispensable to gain a fuller understanding at a more fundamental level .    in this paper",
    ", we have investigated di - higgs and di - higgs+jet production in a variety of model classes , whose single higgs production characteristics can account for the observation of the new particle at the lhc . rather than employing an agnostic field theory approach we have picked well - motivated examples of realistic bsm ( scalar ) sectors , supplemented by the required fermionic particle content , which generalize the sm higgs sector in two fundamentally distinct ways .    the first option deals with models with extended higgs sectors predicting new resonant structures in di - higgs production due to the model s two - higgs doublet character .",
    "furthermore , new kinematical configurations can provide extra analytical handles in the production of a heavy higgs boson in addition to the light higgs . in portal - inspired scenarios ,",
    "the determination of the involved trilinear couplings is important to reconstruct the full extended portal potential for parameter points where the two higgs bosons are not too widely separated in mass . in the mssm ,",
    "a corresponding measurement facilitates the reconstruction of the higgs sector mixing angles @xmath62 and @xmath65 , and hence provides indirect constraints on the stop masses and mixing parameter @xmath215 .",
    "this can be achieved by separating the resonant contribution from continuum production via invariant mass cuts , and applying boosted  @xcite and unboosted  @xcite analysis strategies to the different samples .",
    "the resonant models are contrasted to realizations of the higgs mechanism where the `` higgs '' boson arises as a pseudo nambu - goldstone mode of some spontaneously broken symmetry .",
    "the agreement of current observations with the sm higgs predictions requires the pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson to have similar couplings as the sm higgs boson . along with composite higgs models",
    "this leaves only the pseudo - dilaton as a second option .",
    "the former case implies interpreting the entire higgs doublet as a set of nambu - goldstone fields .",
    "realistic composite higgs scenarios predict strongly - enhanced di - higgs and di - higgs+jet cross sections .    in models with an approximate conformal invariance",
    ", symmetry breaking can be triggered at scales considerably higher and spontaneous breaking of conformal invariance introduces a new light state to the low energy effective theory , which has similar properties as the sm higgs boson as a consequence of eq .",
    "( [ eq : coupling ] ) : the pseudo - dilaton . for both the composite and the dilaton option ,",
    "there are parameter choices such that current observations can be accounted for .",
    "it is their highly modified di - higgs phenomenology which can effectively discriminates these possibilities depending on the further particularities of the conformal sector , and facilitates an lhc measurement of the involved couplings and parameters in case of the composite higgs model . pseudo ",
    "di - dilaton production can be buried in a large hadronic background with no kinematic handles to reconstruct the preferred dilaton decay to gluons . in this sense",
    ", the absence of a `` traditional '' di - higgs phenomenology could be interpreted as evidence for a dilatonic realization . interpreting the presence of a large di - higgs(+jet ) production cross section",
    "is more involved , and could be evidence for a fourth - family ( or more complicated ) realization of the pseudo - dilaton model , but may also be consistent with a composite higgs .",
    "it is clear from our analysis that , no matter what governs the dynamics of the newly - discovered boson , its multi - production phenomenology , which can be studied at the lhc in sufficient detail , will provide a clear image of its role in the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking .",

    "<S> multi - higgs production provides a phenomenologically clear window to the electroweak symmetry breaking sector . we perform a comprehensive and comparative analysis of new electroweak physics effects in di - higgs and di - higgs+jet production . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we discuss resonant di - higgs phenomenology , which arises in the higgs portal model and in the mssm at small @xmath0 , and non - resonant new physics contributions to di - higgs production in models where the newly discovered higgs candidate is interpreted as a pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , for all these scenarios , a measurement of the di - higgs and di - higgs+jet final states provides an accessible and elaborate handle to understand electroweak symmetry breaking in great detail . </S>"
