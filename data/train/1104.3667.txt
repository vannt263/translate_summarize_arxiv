    "in structural mechanics , design optimization is the decision - making process that aims at finding the best set of design variables which minimizes some cost model while satisfying some performance requirements . due to the inconsistency between these two objectives ,",
    "the optimal solutions often lie on the boundaries of the admissible space .",
    "thus , these solutions are rather sensitive to uncertainty either in the parameters ( _ aleatory _ ) or in the models themselves ( _ epistemic _ ) .",
    "_ reliability - based design optimization _ ( rbdo ) is a concept that accounts for uncertainty all along the optimization process .",
    "basically , the deterministic performance model is wrapped into a more realistic probabilistic constraint which is referred to as the _ failure probability_. despite its attractive formulation , the application field of rbdo is still limited to academic examples .",
    "this is mostly due to the fact that it is either based on simplifying assumptions that might not hold in practice ; or in contrast , it requires computationally intensive stochastic simulations that are not affordable for real industrial problems .",
    "the present work attempts to propose an efficient strategy that would _ in fine _ bring the rbdo application field to more sophisticated examples , closer to real engineering cases . in other words ,",
    "the challenge is _ (",
    "i ) _ to provide an optimal safe design within a few hundred evaluations of the performance models and _ ( ii ) _ to be able to quantify and minimize the errors induced by the various assumptions that are made along the development of the resolution strategy .",
    "the remaining part of this introduction is devoted to the formulation of the rbdo problem the authors attempt to solve . a short literature review is also provided as an argument for the presently proposed surrogate - based resolution strategy .",
    "section  [ sec : kriging ] introduces the kriging surrogate model .",
    "a specific emphasis is put on the _ epistemic nature _ of the prediction error that is then used in section  [ sec : doe ] in order to _ quantify _ and _ minimize _ the surrogate error .",
    "section  [ sec : hsbrbdo ] involves the adaptive refinement strategy of the kriging surrogate into a nested reliability - based design optimization loop .",
    "the convergence of the approach is finally heuristically demonstrated in section  [ sec : appli ] through a few academic examples from the rbdo literature .      given a parametric model for the random vector @xmath0 describing the environment of the system to be designed",
    ", the most basic formulation for the rbdo problem reads as follows:@xmath1 in this formulation , @xmath2 is the objective function to be minimized with respect to the design variables @xmath3 , while satisfying to @xmath4 deterministic soft constraints @xmath5 bounding the so - called _ admissible design space _ defined by the analyst .",
    "note that in most applications these soft constraints consist in simple analytical functions that prevent the optimization algorithm from exploring regions of the design space that have no physical meaning ( _ e.g. _ negative or infinite dimensions ) , so that these constraints are inexpensive to evaluate .",
    "a _ deterministic design optimization _ ( ddo ) problem would simply require additional performance functions @xmath6 describing system failure with respect to the specific code of practice . as opposed to the previous soft constraints",
    ", these functions often involve the output of an expensive - to - evaluate black - box function @xmath7  _ e.g. _ a finite element model .",
    "rbdo differs from ddo in the sense that these constraints are wrapped into @xmath8 probabilistic constraints @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 is the minimum safety requirement expressed here in the form of an acceptable _ probability of failure _ which may be different for each performance function @xmath11 .",
    "such probabilities of failure are conveniently defined in terms of the following multidimensional integrals : @xmath12    one should notice that , in the present formulation , the design vector @xmath13 is a set of _ hyperparameters _ defining the random vector @xmath0 . in other words , in this work , design variables are exclusively considered as hyperparameters in the joint probability density function @xmath14 of the random vector @xmath0 because it will later simplify the computation of _ reliability sensitivity _  _ i.e. _ the gradients of the failure probability .",
    "there is however no loss of generality since deterministic design variables might possibly be considered as artificially random ( either normal or uniform ) with small variance  _",
    "i.e. _ sufficiently close to zero .    one could possibly argue that this formulation lacks full probabilistic consideration because the cost function is defined in a deterministic manner as it only depends on the hyperparameters @xmath13 of the random vector @xmath0 .",
    "a more realistic formulation should eventually account for the randomness of the cost function possibly induced by the one in @xmath0 .",
    "however , the present formulation is extensively used in the rbdo literature for simplicity . note however that thanks to the rather low complexity of usual cost models ( analytical functions ) , an accurate simulation - based estimation of a mean cost , say @xmath15}$ ] would not require a large computational effort .      the most straightforward approach to solve the rbdo problem in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rbdo_ria ] ) consists in nesting a reliability analysis within a nonlinear constrained optimization loop .",
    "such methods are referred to as _ double - loop _ or _ nested _ approaches . despite their conceptual simplicity these approaches are often argued to lack efficiency since they require too many evaluations of the performance functions @xmath16 that might involve the output of a time - consuming computer code .",
    "however for a broad range of applications where the performance functions are linear or weakly nonlinear  _ i.e. _ when the    _ first order reliability method _ ( form ) is applicable , the nested approach is able to give results within a reasonable number of evaluations of the performance functions ( _ e.g. _ @xcite achieve convergence within a few thousands evaluations ) .",
    "the formulation in eq .  ( [ eq : rbdo_ria ] ) is known as the _ reliability index approach _",
    "( ria ) . note that ria often refers to nested rbdo algorithm based on form despite the fact that the concept can easily be extended to simulation - based reliability methods .",
    "some authors , starting with @xcite , proposed an alternative formulation to the rbdo problem known as the _ performance measure approach _ ( pma ) .",
    "the probabilistic constraints are transformed into quantile constraints that are approximated using the first - order reliability theory . according to @xcite",
    ", pma would be more stable and efficient than ria because the inner reliability algorithms used to solve the first - order quantile approximation ( the so - called _ mean value _ algorithms ) are argued to be much more efficient than their probability approximation counterparts ( _ e.g. _ the hasofer - lind - rackwitz - fiessler algorithm ) .",
    "the nested approach becomes intractable in the case of more complex performance functions for which the nested reliability analysis should resort to simulation - based methods .",
    "for such cases however , @xcite proposed the so - called _ sample average approximation _ method which consists in gradually refining the simulation - based reliability analysis as the optimization algorithm converges towards an optimal design .",
    "to do so , they propose an empirical stepwise refinement criteria to define whether the number of simulations should be raised or not .",
    "note also that the use of variance reduction techniques can significantly reduce the overall number of simulation runs such as demonstrated in @xcite where the authors used subset simulation .",
    "however , simulation - based approaches still require too many performance functions evaluations to make the approach applicable to real engineering cases even though their application field is growing with the increasing availability of _ high performance computational _",
    "( hpc ) resources ( _ e.g. _ interconnected clusters of pcs ) .",
    "an alternative to double - loop approach consists in decoupling the optimization loop from the reliability analyses so that both can be sequentially performed in an independent manner .",
    "such approaches are referred to as _ sequential approaches _ or _ decoupled approaches _ @xcite .",
    "an advantage of these approaches is that they do not require any reliability sensitivity analysis since the optimization is performed directly onto the performance function .",
    "however , the decoupling often relies on the _ most probable failure point _ ( mpfp ) assumptions and thus suffers from the possible non - unicity of this point and the strong nonlinearities in the performance functions .    _ single - loop approaches _ @xcite attempt to fully reformulate the original rbdo problem into an equivalent ddo problem that allows a simple and efficient resolution by means of classical optimization algorithms .",
    "the approach is mainly based on concepts that are closely related to the notion of partial safety factors .",
    "it is certainly the most computationally efficient approach as soon as the assumptions under which the probabilistic - deterministic equivalence is built hold . once again , most of them are based upon the assumption that the mpfp exists and that it is unique .",
    "_ stochastic subset optimization _ ( sso ) is a simulation - based approach recently proposed by @xcite that consists in finding the region of the admissible design space where the failure probability density function is minimal .",
    "it is based on conditional simulations in a so - called _ augmented reliability space _ where the design variables are artificially considered as random with uniform distribution .",
    "the range of uncertainty in the design variables is reduced along with the identification of low failure probability density regions .",
    "the overall concept is closely related with the subset simulation reliability method proposed by @xcite , and further explored by @xcite for reliability - based design sensitivity analysis . in the end",
    ", the algorithm provides a set of parameters that is likely to contain the optimal solution which can possibly be found by means of a more refined stochastic search algorithm .",
    "however , the problem that sso attempts to solve is not a full rbdo problem in the sense that it is designed to minimize the failure probability whereas the purpose of rbdo is to minimize a cost function under some maximal failure probability constraint .",
    "finally , the approach that is investigated here is the _ surrogate - based _ ( or _ response - surface - based _ ) approach . starting with the premise that the performance function evaluation might involve a time - consuming computational task , the approach consists in replacing this function by a surrogate that is much faster to evaluate .",
    "this surrogate is usually built and possibly refined from a few evaluations of the real performance function .",
    "various surrogates have been used in the structural reliability literature out of which : polynomial response surfaces @xcite , polynomial chaos expansions @xcite , support vector machines @xcite , neural networks @xcite and kriging @xcite .",
    "such surrogates are argued here to be more flexible than the classical taylor - expansion - based methods ( _ i.e. _ approaches using the first- or second - order reliability theory ) that are commonly used in the rbdo literature .",
    "an additional interesting fact about this approach is that some of these surrogates , namely kriging and support vector machines , allow one to quantify an empirical surrogate error measure that can be propagated to the final quantity of interest : the failure probability .",
    "in computer experiments , _ surrogate modeling _ addresses the problem of replacing a time - consuming mathematical model @xmath7 called a _ simulator _ by an _ emulator _ that is much faster to evaluate .",
    "the emulator has the same input space @xmath17 and output space @xmath18 than the simulator . for the sake of simplicity",
    "only scalar - output simulators are considered here .",
    "it is important to note here that both @xmath19 and @xmath20 are deterministic in this context . in the present rbdo application ,",
    "the time - consuming models are the performance functions @xmath21 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rbdo_ria ] ) .",
    "kriging @xcite is one particular emulator that is able to give a probabilistic response @xmath22 whose variance ( spread ) depends on the quantity of available knowledge . in other words ,",
    "the uncertainty in this prediction is purely epistemic and due to a lack of knowledge at specific input @xmath19 . for a more detailed discussion on the distinction that should be made between _ aleatory _ and _",
    "epistemic _ sources of uncertainty , the reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "this interesting property of the kriging surrogate will be used in the next sections to make the surrogate - based rbdo approach adaptive .",
    "in essence , kriging starts with the assumption that the output @xmath23 is a sample path of a gaussian stochastic process @xmath24 whose mean and autocovariance functions are _ unknown _ and to be determined from the values of the model response @xmath25 evaluated onto an experimental design @xmath26 .",
    "more specifically , the so - called _ universal kriging _ ( uk ) model assumes the gaussian process has a stationary autocovariance function and is centered with respect to a non - stationary trend in the form of a linear regression model so that it reads:@xmath27the first term is the regression part that requires the choice of a functional set @xmath28 .",
    "the second term is a stationary gaussian process with zero mean , constant variance @xmath29 and stationary autocorrelation function @xmath30 so that its autocovariance function reads as follows:@xmath31the parameters @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath29 shall be determined according to a given class of symmetric positive definite autocorrelation functions and a given set of regression functions .",
    "the most widely used class of autocorrelation functions is the anisotropic generalized exponential model:@xmath34generally speaking , the choice of the autocorrelation model should be made consistently with the known properties of @xmath7 such as derivability or periodicity ( see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "common regression models involve zero , first and second - order polynomials of @xmath35 .",
    "note however that as for ordinary least - squares regression , the size @xmath36 of the functional basis together with the dimension of the input vector @xmath37 dramatically increases the number @xmath38 of required observations . when attempting to model the output of a high - fidelity computer model , a good choice for the regression model may be an equivalent low - fidelity analytical model built on simplifying assumptions .",
    "the construction of a kriging model consists in a two - stage framework that is further detailed in    subsections [ sec : stage1 ] and [ sec : stage2 ] .",
    "the first stage aims at looking for the distribution of some prediction @xmath39 of the gaussian process ( gp ) at any location @xmath40 conditional on the vector of observations @xmath41 .",
    "since @xmath24 is assumed to be a gaussian process , the vector of observations @xmath42 is distributed as follows : @xmath43where we have introduced the matrices @xmath44 and @xmath45 that are defined with respect to the assumed statistics of the gaussian process .",

    "that the conditional distribution of @xmath51 is also gaussian with mean : @xmath52and variance:@xmath53where we have introduced : @xmath54      the kriging surrogate is an exact interpolator . indeed , noting that the @xmath55-th column of the matrix @xmath45 is equal to the vector @xmath56 , the following relation holds:@xmath57where @xmath58 is the @xmath55-th basis vector of @xmath59 which has all - zero components except its @xmath55-th component equal to one . using the symmetry property of @xmath45 and plugging the latter relation in the predictor s mean in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pred_mean ] ) and in its variance in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pred_var ] ) finally allows to prove the following statement:@xmath60which means that the kriging surrogate interpolates the observations with variance equal to zero ( deterministic prediction ) .",
    "this property holds for any regression and regular autocorrelation models , whatever the values of the parameters @xmath32 , @xmath61 and @xmath29 .      in the first stage",
    "it was assumed that the autocovariance function @xmath62 and the regression model @xmath63 are _ known_. in _ computer experiments _ or in _ geostatistics _ it is never the case so that the models need to be chosen and their parameters must be determined using common statistical inference techniques such as the _ variographic analysis _ ( va ) , _ maximum likelihood estimation _ ( mle ) or _",
    "bayesian estimation _ ( be ) .",
    "historically , the kriging methodology was introduced by geostatisticians in order to predict a map of soil properties from _ in situ _",
    "observations for mining prospection . in this field ,",
    "the autocovariance structure is usually estimated from the data using _ variographic analysis _",
    "then , provided the _ empirical variogram _ features some required properties",
    "it can be turned into an autocovariance model .",
    "however , this methodology is not well - suited to our purpose because of its user - interactivity .    in computer experiments ,",
    "the most widely used methodology is the mle technique .",
    "provided a functional set @xmath28 and a stationary    autocorrelation model @xmath64 are chosen , one can express the likelihood of the data with respect to the model and maximize it with respect to the sought parameters ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath29 ) .",
    "one can show that @xmath33 and @xmath29 can be derived analytically ( using the first - order optimality conditions ) and solely depends on the autocovariance parameters @xmath32 that are solution of a numerically tractable global optimization problem  see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite for more details .",
    "this technique , implemented within the dace toolbox by @xcite , was used for the applications presented in this paper .",
    "note that the be technique consists in weighting the likelihood by a prior over the autocovariance parameters and finally allows to derive a full probabilistic posterior on them .",
    "despites it has an attractive formulation as it allows one to quantify an additional epistemic uncertainty in the autocovariance parameters themselves , it is still difficult to involve it in a nested general - purpose procedure such as the one proposed in this paper due to the required prior information which might not be available .    in the case of mle , the variance @xmath65 underestimates the real variance as it does not account for _",
    "( i ) _ the empirical choice of the autocovariance structure of the gp , and _",

    "bayesian kriging_. even though , the probabilistic response of the kriging model is convenient as it allows one to :    * provide probabilistic confidence intervals in addition to the prediction ; * define refinement criteria to build the kriging surrogate in an adaptive refinement procedure depending on the region of interest as introduced in section  [ sec : doe ] .",
    "various refinement techniques have been proposed in the kriging - related literature , _",
    "e.g. _ for global optimization @xcite or for probability / quantile estimation @xcite .",
    "they are all based on the genuine probabilistic nature of the kriging prediction .",
    "an adaptive refinement technique consists in finding the set of points that should be added to the _ design of experiments _ ( doe ) in order to improve the prediction and reduce its associated epistemic uncertainty in some specific _ region of interest _ @xcite .",
    "in global optimization , the region of interest is the vicinity of the optimum that can be sequentially achieved by means of the so - called _ efficient global optimization _",
    "technique @xcite . in reliability and reliability - based design optimization",
    ", the region of interest in the space of random variables @xmath0 is the vicinity of the limit - state surface @xmath67 ( we drop the subscript @xmath68 in this section for the sake of clarity ) .",
    "provided an initial kriging prediction of the performance function @xmath69 denoted by @xmath70 , the probable vicinity of the limit - state surface @xmath71 can be defined in terms of the following _ margin of uncertainty _ ( epistemic uncertainty):@xmath72where @xmath73",
    "might be chosen as @xmath74 meaning that a 95% confidence interval onto the prediction of the limit - state surface is chosen .",
    "any point that belongs to this margin correspond to an uncertain sign of the prediction .",
    "the spread of this margin should be reduced in order to make the reliability estimation accurate , and this can be achieved by adding new points in the doe that are located in this margin .",
    "the probability that a point @xmath75 falls into the margin @xmath76 ( with respect to the epistemic uncertainty in the prediction ) can be expressed in closed - form as follows:@xmath77note that the same criterion is used in @xcite where it has been named the _ weighted integrated mean squared error _ ( w - imse ) .",
    "then , finding the point that maximizes this quantity on the support of the pdf of @xmath0 will finally bring the best improvement point in the doe . starting with this statement",
    ", many authors in the kriging literature decide to use global optimization algorithms in order to find _ the best _ improvement point .",
    "for instance , @xcite use a different criterion named the _ expected feasibility function _ , and @xcite use the _ constraint boundary sampling _ criterion , but both use a global optimization algorithm to find the best improvement point .      in this paper",
    ", we propose a different strategy that allows one to add _ a set _ of improvement points . indeed , all the proposed refinement criteria ( including the one in eq .",
    "( [ eq : p_x_in_m ] ) ) are highly multimodal , thus meaning that :    * the global optimization problem is not easy to solve ; * there does not really exist _ one _ best point ( especially for the contour approximation problem of interest ) , since each mode is associated with a potentially interesting point to add to the doe .",
    "it may also be faster if one has the ability to perform several simulation runs of @xmath69 at the same time ( _ e.g. _ on some distributed computational platform ) .",
    "note that the idea is inspired from @xcite where the authors use the same idea applied to _ support vector classifiers_.    to do so , the probability to fall in the margin of epistemic uncertainty is multiplied by a weighting pdf @xmath78 so that the following criterion:@xmath79can itself be considered as a pdf up to an unknown but finite normalizing constant .",
    "the weighting density @xmath78 can either be the original pdf of @xmath0 , or , as it is proposed here , the uniform pdf on a sufficiently large confidence region of the original pdf .    such a confidence region might be difficult to define for any given pdf , but as it is usually done in structural reliability @xcite , the original random vector @xmath0 can be transformed into a probabilistically equivalent standard gaussian random vector @xmath80 for which the confidence region is simply an hypersphere with radius @xmath81 .",

    "note that another weighting pdf will be introduced later on ( in section [ sec : augmentedreliabilityspace ] ) for the rbdo problem of interest .",
    "given that pseudo - pdf , one can generate @xmath86 ( say @xmath87 ) samples by means of any well suited _",

    "this population of candidates is then reduced to a smaller one that has essentially the same statistical properties ( _ i.e. _ it uniformally covers @xmath76 ) by means of the @xmath88-means clustering technique @xcite .",
    "we make a final remark considering the three approximate failure subsets @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 defined as follows :     @xmath92 note that the extreme failure subsets are related with the margin of uncertainty through the following set relationship : @xmath93 . due to the positiveness of standard deviation , the following statement",

    "in contrast with the form - based approaches , the proposed error measure allows one to quantify and sequentially minimize the surrogate error onto the final quantity of interest : the optimal failure probability . it is important to note that the numerical efficiency of the proposed strategy mainly relies upon the properties of the space where the kriging surrogates are built : the so - called _ augmented reliability space_. this space is obtained by considering that the design variables in the rbdo problem simply augments the uncertainty in the random vector involved in the reliability problem .",
    "building the surrogates in such a space allows one to reuse them from one rbdo iteration to the other and thus saves a large number of performance functions evaluations .",
    "it is also worth noting that the original refinement strategy proposed in section [ sec : doe ] makes it possible to add several observations in the design of experiments at the same time , and thus to benefit from the availability of a distributed computing platform to speed up convergence .",
