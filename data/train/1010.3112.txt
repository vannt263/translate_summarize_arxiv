    "the probability of a sample configuration provides a useful ground for analyzing genetic data .",
    "popular applications include obtaining maximum likelihood estimates of model parameters and performing ancestral inference [ see @xcite ] . in principle , model - based full - likelihood analyses , such as that based on the coalescent [ kingman ( @xcite , @xcite ) ] , should be among the most powerful methods since they make full use of the data . however , in most cases , it is intractable to obtain a closed - form formula for the probability of a given data set .",
    "a  well - known exception to this hurdle is the ewens sampling formula ( esf ) , which describes the stationary probability distribution of a sample configuration under the one - locus infinite - alleles model in the diffusion limit [ @xcite ] .",
    "notable biological applications of this closed - form formula include the test of selective neutrality [ see @xcite , slatkin ( @xcite , @xcite ) ] .",
    "@xcite provided a plya - like urn model interpretation of the formula , and recently @xcite provided a new combinatorial proof of the esf and extended the framework to obtain new results for the case with a variable population size .",
    "we refer the reader to the latter paper for a nice summary of previous works related to the esf .",
    "note that the esf also arises in several interesting contexts outside biology , including random partition structures and bayesian statistics ; see @xcite for examples of intricate combinatorial connections .",
    "the esf is a special case of the two - parameter sampling formula constructed by pitman ( @xcite , @xcite ) for exchangeable random partitions .",
    "@xcite considered generalizing the infinite - alleles model to include recombination and constructed a recursion relation satisfied by the two - locus sampling probability distribution at stationarity in the diffusion limit .",
    "@xcite later undertook a more mathematical analysis of the two - locus model and provided several interesting results .",
    "however , to date , a general closed - form formula for the two - locus sampling distribution remains unknown .",
    "indeed , it is widely recognized that recombination adds a formidably challenging layer of complexity to population genetics analysis . because obtaining exact analytic results in the presence of recombination is difficult , recent research has focused on developing sophisticated and computationally - intensive monte carlo techniques .",
    "examples of such techniques applied to the coalescent include monte carlo simulations [ see hudson ( @xcite , @xcite ) ] , importance sampling [ see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , de iorio and griffiths ( @xcite , @xcite ) , @xcite ] and markov chain monte carlo methods [ see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "being the simplest model with recombination , the two - locus case has been extensively studied in the past [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] and a renewed wave of interest was recently sparked by @xcite , who proposed a composite likelihood method which uses two - locus sampling probabilities as building blocks .",
    "ldhat , a widely - used software package for estimating recombination rates , is based on this composite likelihood approach , and it has been used to produce a fine - scale map of recombination rate variation in the human genome [ @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "ldhat assumes a symmetric diallelic recurrent mutation model at each locus and relies on the importance sampling scheme proposed by @xcite for the coalescent with recombination , to generate exhaustive lookup tables containing two - locus probabilities for all inequivalent sample configurations and a range of relevant parameter values .",
    "this process of generating exhaustive lookup tables is very computationally expensive . a fast and accurate method of estimating two - locus probabilities would be of practical value .",
    "in this paper , we revisit the tantalizing open question of whether a closed - form sampling formula can be found for the coalescent with recombination .",
    "we show that , at least for the two - locus infinite - alleles model with the population - scaled recombination rate @xmath0 large but not necessarily infinite , it is possible to obtain useful closed - form analytic results .",
    "note that the aforementioned monte carlo methods generally become less efficient as @xmath0 increases .",
    "those methods involve sampling a large collection of genealogical histories consistent with the observed sample configuration , and , when @xmath0 is large , the sampled genealogies tend to be very complicated ; they typically contain many recombination events , and it may take a long time for every locus to reach a most recent common ancestor .",
    "however , contrary to this increased complexity in the standard coalescent , we actually expect the evolutionary dynamics to be easier to describe for large @xmath0 , since the loci under consideration would then be less dependent .",
    "hence , it seems reasonable to conjecture that there may exist a stochastic process simpler than the standard coalescent with recombination that describes the relevant degrees of freedom in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "we believe that our sampling formula may provide some hints as to what that dual process should be .",
    "the work discussed here generalizes previous results [ @xcite , @xcite ] for @xmath1 , in which case the loci become independent and the two - locus sampling distribution is given by a product of one - locus esfs .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows .",
    "consider the diffusion limit of the two - locus infinite - alleles model with population - scaled mutation rates @xmath2 and @xmath3 at the two loci .",
    "for a sample configuration @xmath4 ( defined later in the text ) , we use @xmath5 to denote the probability of observing @xmath4 given the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath0 . for an arbitrary @xmath4 ,",
    "our goal is to find an asymptotic expansion of @xmath5 in inverse powers of  @xmath0 , that is , for large values of the recombination rate @xmath0 , our goal is to find @xmath7 where @xmath8 , and @xmath9 are independent of @xmath0 . as mentioned before , @xmath10 is given by a product of one - locus esfs . in this paper , we derive a closed - form formula for the first - order term @xmath11 .",
    "further , we show that the second - order term @xmath12 can be decomposed into two parts , one for which we obtain a closed - form formula and the other that satisfies a simple strict recursion .",
    "the latter can be easily evaluated using dynamic programming .",
    "details of these results are described in section [ sec : asy ] . in a similar vein , in section [ sec : joi ]",
    ", we obtain a simple asymptotic formula for the joint probability distribution of the number of alleles observed at the two loci .",
    "we remark that our work has practical value in genetic analysis .",
    "while this paper was under review , we applied the technique developed here to obtain analogous results for an arbitrary finite - alleles recurrent mutation model .",
    "see @xcite for details . in that paper",
    ", we performed an extensive assessment of the accuracy of our results for a particular finite - alleles model of mutation , and showed that they may be accurate even for moderate values of @xmath0 , including a range that is of biological interest .",
    "the accuracy ( not discussed here ) of our results for the infinite - alleles model is very similar to that finite - alleles case .",
    "in this section , we review the esf for the one - locus infinite - alleles model , as well as golding s ( @xcite ) recursion relation for the two - locus generalization .",
    "our notational convention generally follows that of @xcite .",

    ", we consider the diffusion limit of a neutral haploid exchangeable model of random mating with constant population size @xmath20 .",
    "we refer to the haploid individuals in the population as gametes .      in the one - locus model , a sample configuration is denoted by a vector of multiplicities @xmath21 , where @xmath22 denotes the number of gametes with allele @xmath23 at the locus and @xmath24 denotes the total number of distinct allelic types observed .",
    "we use @xmath17 to denote @xmath25 , the total sample size . under the infinite - alleles model ,",
    "any two gametes can be compared to determine whether or not they have the same allele , but it is not possible to determine how the alleles are related when they are different .",
    "therefore , allelic label is arbitrary .",
    "the probability of a mutation event at the locus per gamete per generation is denoted by @xmath26 . in the diffusion limit , @xmath27 and @xmath28 with",
    "the population - scaled mutation rate @xmath29 held fixed .",
    "each mutation gives rise to a new allele that has never been seen before in the population .",
    "for the one - locus model just described , @xcite obtained the following result .    at stationarity in the diffusion limit of the one - locus infinite - alleles model with the scaled mutation parameter @xmath30 ,",
    "the probability of an unordered sample configuration @xmath31 is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes the number of allele types represented @xmath23 times , that is , @xmath34 .",
    "let @xmath35 denote an _ ordered _ configuration of @xmath17 sequentially sampled gametes such that the corresponding unordered configuration is given by @xmath4 . by exchangeability ,",
    "the probability of @xmath35 is invariant under all permutations of the sampling order .",
    "hence , we can write this probability of an ordered sample as @xmath36 without ambiguity . it is given by @xmath37^{-1 } = \\biggl [ \\prod_{i=1}^k ( n_i - 1 ) !",
    "\\biggr]\\frac{\\theta^k}{(\\theta)_{n}},\\ ] ] which follows from the fact that there are @xmath38 orderings corresponding to @xmath4 [ @xcite ] . to understand what we mean by ordered and unordered sampling configurations ,",
    "it is helpful to relate the ewens sampling formula to the theory of random partitions .",
    "if the gametes are labeled in order of appearance by @xmath39 , then the resulting sample configuration defines a random partition of @xmath40 $ ] , with gametes belonging to the same block if and only if they have the same allele .",
    "the quantity @xmath41 is then the probability of a _",
    "particular _ partition of @xmath40 $ ] whose block sizes are given by the entries in @xmath4 , while the quantity @xmath42 is the probability of observing _ any _ partition of @xmath40 $ ] with these block sizes .",
    "for example , if @xmath43 , then there are six partitions of @xmath44 $ ] with these block sizes , and so @xmath45 .",
    "it is often more convenient to work with an ordered sample than with an unordered sample . in this paper",
    ", we will work with the former ; that is , we will work with @xmath41 rather than @xmath42 .    in the coalescent process going backward in time , at each event a lineage",

    "it follows from ( [ esf ] ) and ( [ eq : k_n ] ) that @xmath51 is a sufficient statistic for @xmath30 .",
    "golding ( @xcite ) first generalized the one - locus recursion ( [ one - locus - recursion ] ) to two loci , and @xcite later undertook a more mathematical study of the model . we denote the two loci by @xmath55 and @xmath56 , and use @xmath2 and @xmath3 to denote the respective population - scaled mutation rates .",

    "<S> specifically , we consider an asymptotic expansion of the two - locus sampling formula in inverse powers of @xmath0 and obtain closed - form expressions for the first few terms in the expansion . </S>",
    "<S> our asymptotic sampling formula applies to arbitrary sample sizes and configurations .    and    .    . </S>"
