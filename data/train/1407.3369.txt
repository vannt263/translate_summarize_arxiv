    "carbonates are conveyed into the deep earth by subduction , and carbon is recycled to the surface via volcanic processes in the form of co@xmath1-containing fluids and solids , and diamonds @xcite .",
    "however , the details of carbon storage within the earth s interior are unclear . the deep carbon observatory @xcite has been set up to investigate carbon within the earth s deep interior .",
    "caco@xmath0 and mgco@xmath0 play fundamental roles in the global carbon cycle and influence the climate of our planet @xcite .",
    "knowledge of the structures , energetics and other properties of caco@xmath0 and mgco@xmath0 at high pressures is therefore important in understanding the earth s mantle , and especially the carbon cycle .",
    "the low - pressure calcite form @xcite of caco@xmath0 is one of the most abundant minerals on the earth s surface and is the main constituent of metamorphic marbles .",
    "several metastable calcite - like phases have been observed @xcite , and a calcite - related phase has been reported at around 25 gpa @xcite . at pressures of about 2",
    "gpa calcite transforms to the aragonite structure @xcite of @xmath2 symmetry . at about 40 gpa aragonite",
    "transforms into the `` post aragonite '' ( @xmath3 ) structure of caco@xmath0 , which is stable up to at least 86 gpa @xcite .",
    "the low pressure magnesite phase of mgco@xmath0 has the same structure as calcite .",
    "experiments indicate that magnesite is stable up to 80 gpa @xcite , and a phase transition occurs above 100 gpa to an unknown magnesite ii structure @xcite .",
    "density functional theory ( dft ) calculations for high pressure phases of caco@xmath0 and mgco@xmath0 were performed by oganov _ _ et al.__using an evolutionary structure searching algorithm @xcite .",
    "these calculations predicted a transition from the calcite to aragonite to `` post aragonite '' structures of caco@xmath0 , followed by a transition to a structure of @xmath4 symmetry at pressures over 100 gpa .",
    "similar calculations for mgco@xmath0 predicted transitions from magnesite to a structure of @xmath5 symmetry at 82 gpa , followed by a transition to a structure of @xmath6 symmetry at 138 gpa , and a phase of @xmath7 symmetry at 160 gpa @xcite .",
    "calculations using the _ ab initio _ random structure searching ( airss ) technique @xcite have led to the discovery of structures that have subsequently been verified by experiment , for example , in silane @xcite , aluminium hydride @xcite , ammonia monohydrate @xcite and ammonia dihydrate @xcite . in the basic airss approach a cell volume and shape is selected at random from within reasonable ranges , the atoms are added at random positions , and the system is relaxed until the forces on the atoms are negligible and the pressure takes the required value .",
    "this procedure is repeated many times , leading to a reasonably unbiased scheme which allows a significant portion of the `` structure space '' to be investigated , although the sampling may be rather sparse .",
    "this approach is often successful for small systems , but it involves sampling a large portion of the high - energy structure space which is not normally of interest . we therefore reduce the size of the structure space investigated by constraining the searches .",
    "we first perform searches in small cells , constraining the initial structures so that all of the atoms are at least 1   apart .",
    "the low - enthalpy structures obtained from these calculations give us information about the favorable bonding configurations and likely nearest neighbor distances between the different atomic types . at low pressures",
    "we find that the low - enthalpy structures contain well - defined triangular co@xmath0 or ring c@xmath0o@xmath8 units , and therefore we place these units and ca or mg atoms randomly within the cells of random shapes .",
    "we ensure that the atoms are not too close together by constraining the initial values of the minimum distances between atoms for each of the six possible pairs of atomic species .",
    "the six minimum distances are obtained from low - enthalpy structures found in the small - cell searches . to construct the initial structures at higher pressures we use minimum distances from low - enthalpy small - cell structures to prepare new larger structures that approximately satisfy the minimum distance constraints .",
    "this approach helps to space out the different species appropriately , while retaining a high degree of randomness .",
    "we perform searches at both low and high pressures , using structures which are constrained to have a certain symmetry which is enforced during the relaxation , but are otherwise random @xcite .",
    "this approach is useful because low energy structures often possess symmetry @xcite , although symmetry constraints break up the allowed structure space into disconnected regions and can prevent some structures from relaxing to lower energy ones @xcite .",
    "we consider structures containing up to eight formula units ( f.u . ) for caco@xmath0 and twelve f.u .  for mgco@xmath0 .",
