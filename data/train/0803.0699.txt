    "the study of emission from rotation - powered pulsars will soon undergo a major advance with observations by two new @xmath0-ray telescopes .",
    "the agile mission launched in april 2007 and carries a pair - production telescope with sensitivity at 100 mev comparable to the egret telescope on the compton observatory , but with much larger effective area at energies above 1 gev .",
    "agile is expected to find @xmath0-ray pulsar counterparts to some of the unidentified egret sources .",
    "the large area telescope ( lat ) on the gamma - ray large area space telescope ( glast ) , due to launch in early 2008 , will have unprecedented sensitivity ( 30 times better than egret ) and energy resolution for @xmath0-rays in the range of 20 mev to more than 300 gev .",
    "glast is expected to significantly advance our knowledge of particle acceleration and radiation from rotation - powered pulsars , by discovering many more @xmath0-ray pulsars and measuring pulse profiles and phase - resolved spectra to much higher precision .",
    "specifically , the lat may increase the population of @xmath0-ray pulsars to several hundred and obtain flux measurements with error bars five - times smaller than those of egret . in order to make the best use of the power of lat observations",
    ", one needs the most sophisticated and diverse models available .",
    "this paper adds to this effort by presenting , for the first time , results of a full model of high - altitude radiation from a pulsar slot gap and its relation to the geometry of the radio emission .",
    "even 40 years after the discovery of pulsars , the origin of the particles that radiate high - energy photons as well as how and where they are accelerated is still not known .",
    "a number of models have been proposed and studies over the years , including polar cap models , putting the site near the neutron star at the magnetic poles ( arons & scharlemann 1979 , daugherty & harding 1982 ) , and outer gap models , placing the site of acceleration and emission in the outermost magnetosphere near the light cylinder ( cheng et al .",
    "1986 , romani 1996 , hirotani 2001 ) .",
    "such models have had varying degrees of success , with the polar cap models being able to explain very well the phase - resolved spectra of vela -like pulsars ( daugherty & harding 1996 ) and the outer gap models being able to explain more easily the double - peaked profiles of the vela , geminga and crab - like @xmath0-ray pulsars . however , even multiwavelength observations have not been able to definitively rule out any of the proposed models .",
    "studies of the geometry of polar cap accelerators ( arons & scharlemann 1979 , arons 1983 ) discovered the possibility of a slot gap , a narrow bundle of field lines bordering the closed - field region where the parallel electric field is decreasing and accelerating particles can not create pairs . the pair formation front across the polar cap",
    "thus forms a bowl shape as pairs are produced at higher and higher altitude approaching the last open field line .",
    "although the existence of a slot gap has been known for some time , its potential as a high - energy emission site has only recently been explored .",
    "muslimov & harding ( 2003 ) derived the electric potential and field in the slot gap , and modeled the acceleration and pair cascades at altitudes from the neutron star surface up to several stellar radii .",
    "they found that cascades develop over a range of 3 - 4 stellar radii along the slot gap inner boundary .",
    "these cascades have higher pair multiplicity ( number of pairs per primary electron ) than cascades nearer the magnetic axis because the primary electrons accelerate and produce pairs over a larger distance .",
    "the radiation from the slot gap cascades naturally produces a wider hollow cone of emission than the cascades near the surface .",
    "muslimov & harding ( 2004 ) extended the electric field solution in the slot gap to high altitudes and modeled only the curvature radiation of the primary particles .",
    "they found that such emission formed caustic patterns , like those of the  two - pole caustic \" model proposed by dyks & rudak ( 2003 ) to naturally explain the double - peaked profiles of @xmath0-ray pulsars .",
    "however , the spectrum of curvature radiation from radiation - reaction - limited particles alone is too hard to match that of observed @xmath0-ray pulsars .",
    "the radiation model of muslimov & harding ( 2004 ) was not complete since it did not include all sources of primary particle radiation and all particles capable of contributing to high - altitude radiation .",
    "we have now included additional radiation components of the primary particles as well as radiation from electron - positron pairs , produced in polar cap and slot gap cascades at lower altitude , that continue to flow along open field lines with relativistic velocity .",
    "we investigate both the synchrotron radiation of both primaries and pairs , that undergo cyclotron resonant absorption of radio photons and significant increases in pitch angle , and non - resonant inverse - compton scattering of radio photons .",
    "we also explore the geometry of the radio emission in relation to that of the high energy emission . in section [ sec : geom ] , we describe the geometry of the magnetic field and of the slot gap , section [ sec : acc ] discusses the model of acceleration in the slot gap and section [ sec : emission ] details our treatment of the emission processes we model .",
    "we describe the simulation of radiation in the slot gap in section [ sec : sim ] and present the results for the crab pulsar in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : dis ] we discuss the results and how the characteristic features of the model could be measured by glast and agile .",
    "the modeling of the neutron star magnetospheric geometry is based on the calculation of dyks , harding & rudak ( 2004 , dhr04 ) , who adopted the retarded vacuum dipole solution ( e.g. romani & yadigaroglu 1995 , cheng et al .",
    "2000 ) to account for the rotational distortions and sweepback of the magnetic field lines .",
    "while the vacuum dipole solution does not accurately apply to a real pulsar magnetosphere that is filled with charges , and more realistic ideal mhd solutions now exist ( spitkovsky 2006 , timokhin 2006 ) , the mhd solutions are numerical and time - consuming to simulate .",
    "the vacuum dipole solution exists in analytic form , is thus much easier to implement and we believe it exhibits the features like sweepback of field lines that approximate the mhd solutions .",
    "our code first performs kunge - rutta integrations along the distorted field lines to determine the location of the open field footpoints at the neutron star surface that form the distorted polar cap rim .",
    "details of this calculation are given in dhr04 and dyks & harding ( 2004 ) .",
    "we then define  open volume coordinates \" @xmath9 at the stellar surface to identify footpoints of field lines on which particles are traced .",
    "radial \" coordinate @xmath10 ranges from 0 at the magnetic pole to 1 at the polar cap rim .",
    "lines of constant @xmath10 thus form a set of distorted concentric rings that cover the polar cap surface ( see figure 2 of dhr04 ) .",
    "the  azimuthal \" coordinate @xmath11 measures the arclength along each deformed ring of fixed @xmath10 .",
    "the arclength is measured in the direction of increasing magnetic azimuth @xmath12 , counterclockwise around the polar cap , starting from @xmath13 at @xmath14 , defined to be at the magnetic meridian ( i.e. line between the magnetic and spin axes ) .",
    "one notable feature of the distorted polar cap rim is the appearance of a  notch \" at @xmath15 , first discovered by arendt & eilek ( 1998 ) and most prominent between inclination angles of @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( see figure 2 of dyks & harding 2004 ) .",
    "the notches are caused by field lines crossing near the light cylinder because of the sweepback , and produce bunching of fields lines at lower altitudes .",
    "this bunching of field lines will produce enhanced radiation at certain azimuth angles and noticeable features in the radiation phase plots , as will be discussed in ",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "the open volume coordinates ( ` ovc ' ) enable us to selectively model different particle distributions across the polar cap , such as electrons accelerating and radiating in the slot gap . to model a distribution of particles that is uniform in magnetic azimuth ,",
    "we define a set of rings between @xmath18 and @xmath19 with equal spacing @xmath20 .",
    "the footpoints are then placed uniformly around each ring with @xmath21 equal divisions .",
    "since we trace emission from particles on the same number of magnetic field lines around each ring , and the rings have different circumferences , the contribution from different rings is weighted by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the ring length and @xmath24 is the polar cap rim length .      the slot gap , a narrow region bordering the last open magnetic field line where particles can not accelerate rapidly enough to produce pairs before the field drops , is an unavoidable feature of polar cap space - charge limited flow ( sclf ) models ( arons & scharlemann 1979 [ as79 ] , arons 1983 ) .",
    "sclf models assume that charges are freely emitted from the neutron star polar cap surface and flow out along open field lines .",
    "since this charge flow is not sufficient to supply the goldreich - julian charge above the surface , an @xmath25 exists and the charges are accelerated .",
    "radiation from these charges forms electron - positron pairs in the strong magnetic field , which can screen the @xmath25 above a pair formation front ( pff ) in a distance small compared to the acceleration distance , which is typically less than a stellar radius ( as79 , harding & muslimov 2001 ) . on field lines well inside the polar cap rim",
    ", @xmath25 is relatively strong and the pff is very near the neutron star surface .",
    "these models assume a boundary condition that the accelerating electric field and potential vanish at the last open field line . near the boundary , the electric field is decreasing and a larger distance is required for the electrons to accelerate to the lorentz factor needed to radiate photons energetic enough to produce pairs .",
    "the pair front thus occurs at higher and higher altitudes near the boundary and curves upward , asymptotically approaching the last open field line ( harding & muslimov 1998 ) , forming a narrow slot gap .",
    "since @xmath25 is unscreened in the slot gap , particles continue to accelerate and radiate to high altitude along the last open field lines .",
    "the width of the slot gap , @xmath26 , is a function of pulsar period and surface magnetic field , and can be expressed as a fraction in colatitude @xmath27 of the polar cap opening angle , @xmath28 ( muslimov & harding 2003 ) , [ sgwidth ] _ _ sg 2  p(b_12)^-4/7i_45 ^ -3/7 .",
    "[ deltaxi1 ] where we will take @xmath29 . for the crab parameters , rotation period @xmath30 , surface magnetic field @xmath31 and moment of inertia @xmath32 g@xmath33@xmath34 , the slot gap width @xmath35 . here and in the rest of the paper",
    ", we will adopt these values , where @xmath36 comes from the measured @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and @xmath39 is a free parameter within the range @xmath40 that sets the width of the slot gap . although the slot gap width itself is somewhat weakly dependent on these parameters , the slot gap potential and electric field are more strongly dependent on these parameter values ( see  [ sec : acc ] ) .",
    "mh03 found that pair cascades on the inner edge of the slot gap occur at altitudes of 3 - 4 stellar radii and have higher multiplicities @xmath41 than the polar cap cascades .",
    "since the slot gap is very narrow for young pulsars having short periods and high fields , the corresponding solid angle of the gap emission @xmath42 is quite small at low altitudes , @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the dimensionless radius .",
    "however , this approximate expression does not describe the solid angle of radiation from the high - altitude slot gap , where relativistic effects strongly distort the emission pattern ( see  [ sec : results ] ) into narrow caustics , and the solid angle must be computed by 3d mapping on the sky .",
    "so even though only a small fraction of the polar cap flux is accelerated in the slot gap , the radiated flux @xmath45 can be substantial .",
    "the particles in the slot gap can achieve very high lorentz factors which at altitudes of several stellar radii are limited by curvature radiation losses , to @xmath46 ( muslimov & harding 2004 ) . in this paper",
    ", we model the emission from the electrons in the slot gap as they continue to accelerate to high altitude above the region of pair formation .",
    "the solution for the electric potential and parallel electric field in the slot gap was presented by muslimov & harding ( 2003 , mh03 ) in the low altitude limit and by muslimov & harding ( 2004 , mh04 ) in the high altitude limit .",
    "both solutions assume a space - charge limited flow of electrons from the neutron star surface , with the boundary condition @xmath47 at the stellar surface , where @xmath48 is the true space charge density and @xmath49 is the goldreich - julian charge density .",

    "in addition , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are general relativistic parameters . since the @xmath62 decreases faster than @xmath63 above the surface ( for the explicit expressions see mh03 ) , the deficit @xmath64 increases with distance , causing a parallel electric field , @xmath65 to develop .",
    "the treatment of the electric field in the slot gap by mh03 and mh04 differs from that of arons & scharlemann ( 1979 ) and arons ( 1983 ) in that mh03 take into account the screening of the electric field by pairs on field lines interior to the slot gap ( see  [ sec : sggeom ] ) .",
    "this forms fully conducting boundaries on both the inner and outer edges of the slot gap , causing a lower electric field in the slot gap . from eqn",

    "the component due to non - resonant ics from primaries and from pairs ( which appears below the scale of the plot ) make negligible contributions .",
    "the non - resonant compton scattering contribution is much lower than that of resonant absorption because the cyclotron absorption cross section is orders of magnitude higher , being a first order process , than the thomson cross section for non - resonant ics , being a second - order process .",
    "furthermore , the particles undergo absorptions of many photons at the resonant before radiating the most significant synchrotron emission , reaching high landau levels . thus the ratio of resonant absorption to ics is even larger than the simple ratio of the cross sections .",

    "the flux levels of the resulting model spectra were then plotted with the data from the corresponding phase intervals without any renormalization .",
    "generally , the phase - resolved spectra do not fit the data as well as the phase - averaged spectrum .",
    "this may be due to the fact that the low - energy profile peaks ( due to pair synchrotron emission ) are not exactly phase - aligned with the peaks of the high - energy profile ( due mostly to primary curvature emission ) .",
    "however , the data and model spectra match fairly well for the p1 , p2 and bridge intervals . the primary synchrotron component makes a larger contribution in the peaks and the bridge , which is expected since the primary electrons radiate only along a narrow set of field lines .",
    "the phase alignment of the first and second peaks in the profile across frequency bands from radio to high - energy @xmath0-ray is a hallmark of the crab pulsar and difficult to explain unless the emission originates from the same location in the magnetosphere .",
    "as we have seen in the last section , the caustics that form in emission along the trailing field lines at the edge of the open volume naturally produce phase - aligned peaks , even if the emission does not originate at the same location along the field lines . a requirement for caustic peak formation is emission that is extended along these field lines above altitudes of a few tenths of @xmath224 .",
    "one possibility to explain the phase alignment of radio and high - energy peaks in the crab profile is that the radio cone emission , which is already expected in the standard model to come from altitudes above @xmath225 , is extended by several tenths of @xmath224 in altitude . to explore this possibility ,",
    "we modify the standard cone beam model by spreading the emission from @xmath226 to @xmath227 and decreasing its width @xmath228 , preserving the same luminosity . to implement this extended radio beam in the cyclotron resonant absorption / synchrotron emission component",
    ", we divide the beamlets of incident radio photons among a number of discrete altitudes between @xmath229 and @xmath230 .    the resulting phaseplots and profiles for the extended radio emission model",
    "are shown in figure 5 .",
    "the radio emission indeed forms caustics similar to those seen in the high - energy emission phaseplots . to produce radio caustics we need to extend the radio conal emission from @xmath226 to @xmath231 and take its width as @xmath232 . the resulting radio profile at the same @xmath212 displays two peaks separated by 0.4 in phase that are at the same phases as the high - energy peaks .",
    "the high - energy phaseplots and profile calculations use the same parameters for the primary electrons and pairs as the model described in the previous section , the only difference being the radio beam geometry .",
    "there are only minor differences in the high - energy profiles , with a higher and more evenly distributed emission level in the bridge region and a less extended trailing wing on peak 2 above 100 mev .",
    "the resulting high - energy phase - averaged spectra , shown in figure 6 , are also very similar to those of the standard radio beam case in figure 3 .",
    "the level of the pair synchrotron spectrum is slightly lower but the shape is the same .",
    "the shape of the primary synchrotron spectrum is somewhat different , but the peak is still around 100 mev .",
    "the primary curvature radiation is of course unchanged since it does not depend of the radio emission .",
    "there are somewhat larger differences in the phase - resolved spectra , shown in figure 7 , since they are more sensitive to the details of the radio emission geometry .",
    "the pair synchrotron components are lower in the leading wings , lw1 and lw2 , but higher in the trailing wings , tw1 and tw2 , and about the same in the peaks , p1 and p2 , and bridge intervals .",
    "similarly , the primary synchrotron components are lower in the leading wings and higher in the trailing wings , with the exception of tw2 , but higher in the bridge .",
    "a model of radiation from young , rotation - powered pulsars has been investigated , assuming that the emission we observe occurs at high altitudes in the magnetosphere .",
    "we include two distributions of particles radiating along open field lines at high altitude : primary electrons accelerating in the slot gap from the stellar surface to near the light cylinder , and non - accelerating electron - positron pairs on field lines bordering and interior to the slot gap .",
    "simulating spectral formation in 3d , we are able to study pulse profiles in different energy bands as well as phase - resolved spectra .",
    "we choose to first model the crab pulsar , since it is bright in all wavebands from optical to high - energy @xmath0-rays , with good phase - resolved spectral measurements . in our model ,",
    "three different components dominate the crab phase - averaged spectrum , curvature and synchrotron radiation of primary electrons and synchrotron radiation of pairs . the synchrotron radiation results from cyclotron resonant absorption of radio photons in the low magnetic field at high altitude .",
    "cyclotron resonant absorption of radio photons using standard core and cone emission models can reproduce high - energy pulse profiles but not the observed radio profiles or the phase alignment of high - energy and radio peaks .",
    "extension of conal radio emission along the last open field lines results in caustic formation that can both produce a double - peaked radio profile and the phase - alignment with high - energy peaks .",
    "however , we find that the peaks in the model profiles at energies below 100 mev are not exactly phase - aligned with the peaks in the profile above 100 mev .",
    "also , our model phase - averaged spectrum does not reproduce exactly the observed spectrum above 100 mev , because the curvature radiation component appears high relative to the that of the primary synchrotron radiation . the observed spectrum in the peak intervals is matched better by the model spectra where the curvature radiation component is relatively lower .",
    "we predict that , due to the multicomponent nature of the model spectra , transitions between different components may be observed as dips in the peak and phase - averaged spectrum around 20 and 200 mev which may be verified by glast lat observations .",
    "since absorption of radio photons is critical to the production of the synchrotron emission components , this model predicts that the radio and high - energy emission in the synchrotron dominated parts of the spectrum , should be correlated in time as well as in phase . in our phase - averaged model spectrum of the crab",
    ", the synchrotron radiationn dominates below about 200 mev , so we predict that correlated variability should be seen in optical , x - ray and @xmath0 rays below 200 mev . although lundgren et al .",
    "( 1995 ) detected no observable correlation between radio giant pulses and egret flux , shearer et al .",
    "( 2003 ) found small but significant ( 3 % ) enhancement of optical flux during crab giant radio pulses .",
    "lommen et al .",
    "( 2007 ) found a correlation between the arrival time of pulses from vela with x - ray profile shape as measured by rxte .",
    "such a correlation suggests a strong connection between radio and x - ray emisson .",
    "all of these results are consistent with our prediction if the egret photons that lundgren et al .",
    "( 1995 ) considered were dominated by the curvature radiation component ( @xmath233 mev ) , which should not exhibit any correlations with radio emission .",
    "although we have found from purely geometrical consideration that radio emission extended along the outer edge of the open field lines can produce a double - peaked profile whose peaks are in phase with those of the high - energy profiles , we must ask why the radio emission geometry of the crab pulsar should be so different from that of other pulsars , including apparently the other known @xmath0-ray pulsars .",
    "but if one looks at known x - ray pulsars , the radio and x - ray profiles of some millisecond pulsars such as psr b1957 + 20 and psr b1821 - 24 also have phase - aligned peaks .",
    "in fact , the standard core and cone radio geometry is based primarily on emission morphology of pulsars having much longer periods in the range 0.5 - 1 s. it is possible that the radio emission geometry in faster pulsars could be quite different .",
    "one could speculate that the slot gaps , that are predicted to exist only in the young and/or fast pulsars , sustain a beam of high energy primary particles near the last open field line that can interact with a flow of lower energy pairs , or an opposite flow of particles in a return current , to produce instabilities that lead to an extended radio component .",
    "these pulsars are also the ones that have giant radio pulses , a phenomenon that may be related to the non - standard emission geometry ( hankins & eilek 2007 ) .",
    "takata & chang ( 2007 ) and tang et al ( 2007 ) recently presented results of a modified outer gap model for energy dependent pulse profiles and phase - resolved spectra of the crab pulsar . in that work",
    "the classic outer gap , which extended from the null charge surface to the light cylinder along the last open field line , is assume to be extended below the null chanrge surface , so that the lw1 and tw2 parts of the pulse can be produced by emission from the second magnetic pole .",
    "the geometry of the modified outer gap model and that of the slot gap model presented in this paper are now quite similar .",
    "all the different parts of the profile come from the same regions of the magnetosphere in both models , with the exception of the first peak , which in the outer gap primarily comes from near the light cylinder . in the slot gap model ,",
    "the first peak comes mostly from the caustic of the pole opposite to the one producing the second peak , although our @xmath204 mev profile also has substantial components from both poles .",
    "the radiation mechanisms of the outer gap are very different from those of our slot gap model , with the major difference being the link to radio emission through resonant absorption of the radio emission in the slot gap model .",
    "while the optical to hard x - ray component of the crab spectrum is produced by synchrotron radiation of pairs in both models , resonant absorption is responsisble for the pair pitch angles in the slot gap model but in the outer gap the pair pitch angles come from cascades outside the gap .",
    "also , the 10 mev to 500 mev spectrum comes from inverse compton emission in tang et al ( 2007 ) , while in our model this component comes from synchrotron radiation of primaries undergoing resonant absorption . the highest energy part of the crab spectrum , above a few hundred mev , comes from primary curvature radiation in both models , although this component originates only from very high altitude in the outer gap model .",
    "although we have not presented results on the polarization here , this will be explored in future work .",
    "the expected properties of polarization in a two - pole caustic geometry have been investigated by dyks et al .",
    "they found that the position angle and polarization degree as a function of phase produce a reasonable match to the optical polarization of the crab pulsar ( kanbach et al .",
    "since the radiation modeled in this paper includes emission on interior field lines as well as in the slot gap , we expect that the polarization properties could be somewhat different and perhaps also energy dependent .",
    "other crab - like pulsars , such as psr b0540 - 60 and psr b1509 - 58 , have very similar x - ray to low - energy @xmath0-ray spectra to that of the crab , but notably no egret detections .",
    "however , their single peaked high - energy profiles are quite different from the crab profile , suggesting a different viewing angle . both of these pulsars are at larger distances , so that the egret upper limits are above the level of emission they would have with an exact match of the crab spectrum . a glast lat detection of the high - energy emission component(s ) would thus be able to probe the geometry of the slot gap or of other radiation models .",
    "these pulsars and also the vela - like pulsars will be investigated in future work .",
    "vela is predicted to have a slot gap so the spectrum above 100 mev should be similar to that of the crab .",
    "but since the pair multiplicity should be smaller than for the crab , one expects a lower pair synchrotron component which may also peak at a different energy .",
    "the relation of the radio to high - energy peaks in vela - like pulsars is quite different , with a single radio peak leading double - peaks at high energy .",
    "one possibility is that the radio cone is at too low an altitude to form caustic peaks ( harding 2005 ) .    in this work",
    "we have assumed steady - state acceleration in a space - charge limited flow model .",
    "however , since the time - dependence of such accelerators has not been investigated , this may not be correct .",
    "in fact , the magnitude of the current in sclf models has not been determined self - consistently but is assumed to be constant at the goldreich - julian value across the polar cap .",
    "this current distribution is not consistent with that found in global force - free models of the pulsar magnetosphere ( spitkovsky 2006 , timokhin 2006 ) , that require a current that departs from the goldreich - julian value in the outer parts of the polar cap . matching",
    "the current distribution required by the global models with the average boundary condition on the charge flow of the sclf accelerator implies either temporal or spatial fluctuations in the current and voltage .",
    "a lower primary charge flow in the slot gap or a smaller slot gap width may in fact produce a better match of the model spectrum to the observed spectrum of the crab .",
    "investigation of the temporal stability and boundary conditions of acceleration models will ultimately be needed in order to accurately model and understand pulsar high - energy emission .",
