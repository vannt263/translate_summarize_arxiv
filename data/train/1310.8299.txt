    "the detection of warm gas emission from the inner few au of young circumstellar disks @xcite has opened a new window on the chemical and physical characterization of the environments where rocky planet properties are probably set .",
    "surveys of mid - infrared ( mir ) molecular emission from @xmath3100 circumstellar disks over a range of spectral types and evolutionary stages have already moved important steps forward in this context @xcite .",
    "the observed emission from water , oh , and organic molecules ( hcn , c@xmath4h@xmath4 , and co@xmath4 ) comes from warm gas ( 300 - 1000 k ) in the planet - forming zone of the disk , and is generally found to be common in t tauri disks , while reduced or absent in more massive ( herbig ae / be ) or more evolved ( transitional ) disks . moreover , molecular abundances are found to be not simply inherited from the prestellar phase , but show evidence for an ongoing active chemistry . the infrared molecular gas emission is a privileged tracer of the processing of warm material in evolving protoplanetary disks .",
    "studies of the interplay between accretion histories and the molecular chemistry are essential to our understanding of disk evolution and planet formation , and could perhaps provide hints to help explain the diversity in composition of ( exo)planets .",
    "an often overlooked element in disk evolution is the effect of non - steady accretion processes during star formation . in this regard ,",
    "an exceptional experiment was provided by a recent extreme accretion outburst in ex lupi ( the prototype of exor variables , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is a classical t tauri star showing eruptive accretion phenomena that in strength are in between fuor outbursts and the typical variability found in the t tauri phase of young stars . from comparison of mir spectra taken during outburst and in a preceding quiescent phase",
    ", @xcite found that while the molecular spectrum in quiescence showed water , oh , and organic emission typical of t tauri systems , it changed remarkably in outburst .",
    "water emission increased , suggesting a larger extent of the warm emitting gas caused by the increased disk heating . on the other hand , detection of previously unseen oh lines suggested ongoing oh production via uv photodissociation of water .",
    "strikingly , emission from all organics disappeared .",
    "ex lupi provided the first evidence that the warm molecular gas emission can change dramatically , in the _ same _ disk , depending on the accretion phase .",
    "if the exor and classical t tauri variability are phases of the same accretion history that all forming stars undergo @xcite , effects similar to those observed in ex lupi might be common in t tauri stars . to better understand both the properties and the evolution of the molecular gas in the planet formation region of _ all _ circumstellar disks we may need to consider the time domain , especially during the non - steadily accreting phases of the star - disk interaction .",
    "this work was initiated to probe this idea .    in this paper",
    "we study the emission observed toward the active t tauri star dr tau . situated in the taurus - auriga star - forming region at 140 pc from earth @xcite ,",
    "dr tau is one of the most studied classical t tauri stars .",
    "yet , it is one of the most peculiar as well .",
    "it showed a slow brightness increase over @xmath5 years between 1960 and 1980 @xcite , which raised it from being a relatively faint star ( @xmath6 mag in @xmath7 band ) to one of the brightest stars in the taurus association ( @xmath8 mag in @xmath7 band ) .",
    "its behavior was attributed to strong non - steady accretion @xcite , and dr tau was included in the first list of exor variables by @xcite together with ex lupi . since 1980 , dr tau has mantained its enhanced brightness while showing large photometric and spectroscopic variability ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "it is one of the first disks where warm water vapor emission was detected @xcite .",
    "together with water , oh and organic molecules have been detected at both mid- and near - infrared ( nir ) wavelengths @xcite . given its rich molecular emission and its strong and variable accretion , it is an optimal target for investigating how the former is affected by the latter . in this work",

    "dr tau was observed on six nights between november 2011 and january 2012 . in three out of these six nights ,",
    "simultaneous observations with the two vlt instruments were performed , and these are the three epochs studied in this paper ( see table [ tab : obs ] ) . the first and second epochs were taken 5 days apart ; the third was taken 43 days after the second .",
    "such a scheduling spanning different time ranges was proposed in an attempt of observing the star in different phases of its unpredictably variable accretion . however , the exact choice of dates depended on atmospheric conditions , which we required to be photometric , and the challenging scheduling of the two vlt instruments , which we required to be used simultaneously . in each epoch ,",
    "dr tau was observed for @xmath2 hours with visir , in good atmospheric and airmass conditions ( see table [ tab : obs ] ) .",
    "given that dr tau is a bright star , the x - shooter observations required a much shorter time ( @xmath11 min ) and were performed during the first quarter of each visir epoch .",
    "observing water emission lines from earth is difficult because every targeted line has its telluric counterpart .",
    "the observations were done in november - january to maximize the doppler shift between the target and earth , such that the targeted lines were shifted by @xmath545 km / s from their telluric counterparts ( table [ tab : obs ] ) .",
    "we chose to observe high - energy lines ( at 12.396 and @xmath12 m , upper level energy @xmath13 5000 - 5800 k ) , to ensure weak telluric counterparts and minimize absorption effects even in the case of partial overlap of line wings ( see figure [ fig : tell_corr ] ) .",
    "the line sample was restricted by a limited availability of filters along with a need for long integrations to reach sufficient signal - to - noise ratios ( s / n ) , to be able to probe variations in emission from one epoch to the other . given these constraints ,",
    "one visir setting per epoch was observed , centered at 12.407 @xmath1 m .",
    "visir was used in the cross - dispersed mode , providing a resolving power r @xmath14 ( @xmath1515 km / s ) at 12.4 @xmath1 m . the data were taken using standard chopping and nodding techniques for visir .",
    "the telescope nods parallel to the slit between positions on - source ( a ) and off - source ( b ) with a sequence abba , and a secondary mirror chops parallel to the slit with a sequence abab starting in the nod position a , and baba starting in the nod position b. each visir raw datacube provided by eso includes the four half - chop - cycle images performed in one nod position ( e.g. , a@xmath16 , b@xmath16 , a@xmath17 , b@xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the chop cycle number ) .",
    "the slit used in the high resolution mode ( width = @xmath19 , length = @xmath20 ) does not allow chopping on - slit , as the minimum chopping throw is @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , the b positions do not have the source on the slit and are used only for background subtraction .",
    "this effectively reduces the on - source integration time of visir in the cross - dispersed mode to half the total time , bringing it to 2940 s in each of our epochs .",
    "the visir data were reduced using a suite of self - made idl routines intended to optimize the standard visir data reduction of the eso recipe execution tool ( esorex ) , version 3.9.0 .",
    "first , small shifts ( typically fractions of a pixel ) caused by mechanical oscillations of the grating between sequential images needed to be corrected . to do that , in each nod position",
    "the individual a and b images were combined , applying the shift estimated by cross - correlation of two telluric lines observed in the region between the targeted water lines . in our data , this procedure worked well in reducing artifacts from sky residuals that would otherwise affect the targeted water emission , if processed only through the standard eso pipeline ( a similar correction was implemented by * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "an estimate of the atmospheric seeing at 12.4 @xmath1 m ( @xmath24-band ) was based on the measured width of the psf , and is reported in table [ tab : obs ] .",
    "variable atmospheric conditions can overwhelm the target signal in a given frame , when the sky infrared background varies too much from a to b. the actual number of frames that could be used in each epoch is therefore smaller than the total and differed from epoch to epoch ( see table [ tab : obs ] ) .",
    "nod images were then corrected through pixel interpolation for small distortions caused by the instrument , using the esorex parameters ` slit_skew ` = @xmath25 and ` spectrum_skew ` = @xmath26 , which were found to be appropriate in the 12.4 @xmath1 m setting .",
    "wavelength calibration of individual spectra was done by cross - correlation with an atmospheric model set on typical paranal conditions , using the same telluric absorption lines mentioned above .",
    "an additional background subtraction was needed to correct for sky background residuals produced by variable atmospheric water vapor within chop cycles .",
    "this was performed by a median subtraction row by row in the cross - dispersed direction , as in @xcite .",
    "an individual spectrum was then extracted from each combined ( ab ) nod frame using optimal extraction to maximize s / n @xcite .",
    "the individual spectra in each epoch were then combined into a weighted average yielding one spectrum per epoch .",
    "flux errors on individual pixels in the averaged spectrum were set to the standard deviation of the weighted mean of pixel values as measured in the total number of frames in each epoch .",
    "telluric absorption had a negligible influence on the two targeted water lines during this monitoring of dr tau , for the reasons explained at the beginning of this section . nonetheless , a telluric standard was observed and utilized to correct also for the inhomogeneous detector response ( as flat fields are usually not taken for visir ) .",
    "we used a herbig ae / be star ( hd50138 ) , which was observed after dr tau each night , selected on the basis of its brightness and absence of emission lines at 12.4 @xmath1 m .",
    "the spectra were normalized to their continua , aligned by cross - correlation , and then divided ( drtau / hd50138 ) , after airmass ( @xmath27 ) correction of hd50138 with respect to dr tau .",
    "to do that , an exponential correction was applied to the telluric absorption lines in the hd50138 spectrum , as @xmath28 .",

    "figure [ fig : convfact ] shows a linear fit to the conversion factors estimated over the three epochs using two standards each night .",
    "the model fits the individual epochs reasonably well , supporting the idea of overall stable atmospheric conditions .",
    "the continuum in dr tau was then estimated using the fitted relation between airmass and conversion factor , extrapolated at the average airmass of dr tau in each epoch ( figure [ fig : convfact ] ) .",
    "the estimated continuum decreases by 25% in the second epoch , and rises by 23% in the third . in the second epoch ,",
    "the seeing was relatively worse ( but still lower than the slit width , ensuring limited slit losses ; see table [ tab : obs ] ) , and the two photometric standards were taken at @xmath300.5 lower airmasses with respect to dr tau . to check",
    "whether the decrease in continuum level could be simply due to the general worse seeing conditions , we used the technique described above to estimate the continuum also for the telluric standard hd50138 .",
    "we found the same trend , a decrease in the second epoch followed by an increase in the third , but confined to within 5% , comparable to the precision obtained on the photometric standards .",
    "we therefore concluded that variable atmospheric conditions may have affected by at most 5% the continuum in dr tau , but that it intrinsically changed by @xmath31 .",

    "the pipeline applies standard reduction procedures to perform background subtraction , spectral extraction , wavelength calibration , and flux calibration in each spectral arm separately .",

    "stronger water lines for higher accretion were observed probably due to new water vapor , evaporated from icy solids beyond the snowline ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and/or formed in situ in the gas phase from molecular hydrogen and oxygen @xcite . the weaker and shorter accretion variability observed in dr tau ( and typical of t tauri stars ) might , instead , have the time to affect only the disk surface layers and its main effect would probably be restricted to a variable uv photochemistry . in this case ,",
    "weaker water lines might be observed in case of photodissociation .",
    "this new monitoring study of dr tau suggests that during the t tauri phase , a change in @xmath49 within a factor @xmath2 over a few days only is probably not enough to affect significantly the water vapor in the inner disk , at least as probed in the @xmath24 band . perhaps the strength and duration necessary to drive stronger water vapor emission ( and possibly production ) as observed in ex lupi are provided only during the extreme exor outbursts ( figure [ fig : drtau_exlup_comp ] ) .",
    "we investigated the effects of stellar accretion variability on the water vapor at planet - forming radii in circumstellar disks during the t tauri phase , by means of a new high - resolution uv  to  mir monitoring of dr tau .",
    "three epochs of simultaneous vlt / visir and vlt / x - shooter spectra were obtained between november 2011 and january 2012 .",
    "accretion luminosity was derived from the x - shooter data and found to change within a factor @xmath2 ( decreasing in the second epoch , increasing in the third ) .",
    "no change in water line fluxes at 12.4 @xmath1 m was measured at a significant level from the visir spectra .",
    "the enhancement in water emission observed during an extreme accretion outburst in ex lupi suggests that accretion can drive water vapor production , possibly in connection with a recession of the snowline @xcite . while the change in accretion between the epochs in dr tau was not large enough to distinguish changes in water emission from noise",
    ", our monitoring suggests that if the change in @xmath49 is confined to within a factor @xmath2 , then water vapor emission as probed at 12.4 @xmath1 m may remain mostly unaffected ( within @xmath80 )",
    ". it would be interesting to explore until when this is still the case : what conditions are mild and stable enough to leave the inner disk undisturbed , and where the breaking point is ( figure [ fig : drtau_exlup_comp ] ) .",
    "this exploration would require constraining two parameters : the strength and the duration of the accretion outburst .",
    "while an increase in water line fluxes of @xmath77 20 - 30% is needed to clearly stand out from the noise with the current instrumentation ( and ex lupi suggests that this might happen at an increase in @xmath49 of a factor @xmath81 ) , an accretion event duration of at least a few weeks might be necessary to allow for thermal equilibrium at the gas densities probed by the observed water vapor @xcite .",
    "much is still to be understood in the production / destruction of water vapor as driven by accretion variability .",
    "future observations promise to shed more light on the role of accretion histories in shaping the molecular environments of the planet - formation region in protoplanetary disks .",
