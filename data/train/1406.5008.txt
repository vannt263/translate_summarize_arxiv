    "we will use the term `` _ _ local _ _ breaking of tr symmetry on the 3d ti surface '' if the magnetic field does not destroy the surface states .",
    "as we have just explained , this does not necessarily require spatially inhomogeneous magnetic field configurations .",
    "let us now turn to question b ) . to avoid confusion , we stress that the physics of the half - integer qhe , which we discuss in this work , can be described in a single particle picture and has no direct relation to the physics of the fractional qhe ( in the sense of strmer s and tsui s discovery ) which is a many - body phenomenon .",
    "the half - integer qhe can be expected as soon as surface states are present .",
    "we emphasize , that it does not rely on a precise dispersion but rather on the low - energy spin - texture and on the fact that there is an odd number of dirac fermions on the surface .",
    "more precisely , the half - integer qhe is a manifestation of fermion - number fractionalization in the sense of jackiw and rebbi.@xcite the 3d ti surface states are topologically protected fermionic zero modes associated with a spatial kink in a background bosonic field ( the mass `` field '' in the present context ) .",
    "generally , the fermion number in the presence of a bosonic kink is shifted by one half as compared to the situation without a kink . specifically , if the zero mode is filled ( empty ) , the fermion number is @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) . in the presence of the magnetic field",
    ", the zero - energy state has additional ll degeneracy @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the area penetrated by the flux and @xmath38 is the flux quantum .",
    "consequently , the fermion density at chemical potential @xmath39 is @xmath40 . in view of the relationship between fermion density and ( the quantum part of ) the transverse conductivity,@xcite",
    "this unveils the fundamental topological reason for the half - integer qhe .",
    "the result of argument remains unchanged even in the presence of finite but small zeeman energy @xmath41 ( gapped 3d ti surface states ) .",
    "typical transport experiments are carried out on 3d ti slabs , which have two major surfaces ( called `` top '' and `` bottom '' in what follows ) with a single dirac fermion each . in most experimental situations ,",
    "contacts are attached at or near the side walls of the probes , and thus both major surfaces are probed simultaneously .",
    "therefore , quantum hall data@xcite of 3d tis displays the odd - integer series described by eq .   for @xmath42 .",
    "( one shared green edge channel ) is probed by a local four contact measurement consisting of two opposite bias gates ( orange ) and , perpendicularly , two probing gates connected by an amperemeter ( blue ) . for further explanation ,",
    "see main text . ]",
    "one could expect that it is sufficient to attach all measuring contacts on a single surface of the 3d ti slab to measure the qhe of a single dirac fermion.@xcite if the contacts are sufficiently far away from the sample boundaries , one might then hope to measure a half - integer hall response . to be specific ,",
    "let us assume that a bias voltage is applied between two electrodes attached to a ti surface , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : notransport ] .",
    "one measures the hall current passing through an amperemeter connecting two perpendicular probing contacts and hopes to extract a half - integer @xmath43 from @xmath44 .",
    "however , this attempt will fail .",
    "indeed , let us assume that the surface is characterized by a half - integer quantized hall conductivity and zero longitudinal conductivity .",
    "in order to find the total current between the current probes one should take into account not only the current flowing in the part of the ti surface between the contacts but also the current distribution in the rest of the surface . the total current can be found by integrating the transverse current density @xmath45 along a contour shown by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : notransport ] .",
    "this integral is , however , proportional to @xmath46 and is equal to zero , since the surface is terminated by a metallic edge which represents an equipotential line .",
    "thus , such an experiment would yield @xmath47 .",
    "the above discussion assumed applying bias voltage and measuring current .",
    "one can equally analyze the reverse situation when a current is injected and the hall voltage is probed .",
    "to this end , two metallic contacts are supposed to be attached in the central region of the ti surface .",
    "they serve as source and drain for the current .",
    "however , as in the @xmath8 limit current always flows along equipotential lines , it is actually not possible to inject current in the middle of a qh system . instead , `` edge states '' circulating around the contact will be formed .",
    "therefore , this measurement will yield a null result as well .",
    "thus , an attempt to measure a half - integer quantized @xmath0 in a transport experiment fails .",
    "the reason for this is as follows . to measure directly a half - integer @xmath0",
    ", one should explore local characteristics of a single ti surface .",
    "as is clear from the above analysis , transport experiments do not satisfy this requirement .",
    "one can , however , devise an alternative approach by measuring an electromagnetic response of the system to a local perturbation .",
    "as discussed below , this kind of measurement does probe local properties of the system and , therefore , is able to yield directly a half - integer hall conductivity .",
    "the case of transport experiments in non - ideal situations ( @xmath48 ) and with a more complex arrangement of contacts is left for future investigation .      in a series of papers,@xcite s .- c .",
    "zhang and coworkers proposed to characterize 3d tis by associated electromagnetic field theories .",
    "in particular , they argued that the corresponding bulk em theory contains the @xmath4 term ( second chern character ) :    @xmath49    [ eq : stheta ]    here @xmath50 denotes the fine structure constant of qed .",
    "if not specified otherwise , we set the speed of light and planck s constant to unity @xmath51 in the entire paper .",

    "the value @xmath5  ( mod  @xmath6 ) corresponds to the surface hall conductivity @xmath63 , with uncertainty in an integer multiple of @xmath64 . here",
    "the following questions arise .",

    "we will return to this issue and the closely related question of parity anomaly@xcite in sec .",
    "[ sec : nlsm : parity ] .",
    "while the em theory describing a surface of a tr - invariant 3d ti does not contain a cs term , an elegant tme description is recovered once tr invariance is locally broken .",
    "let us emphasize that a tme response associated with @xmath4 term is a general property of qh systems .",
    "the special feature of 3d ti surfaces ( with locally broken tr invariance ) is in a half - integer value of the associated hall conductance .",

    "we concentrate on the latter .",
    "the essence of the effect is that an electric charge @xmath65 placed above a qh system ( posed in the plane @xmath23 ) induces an inhomogeneous magnetic field configuration which can be described by a mirror magnetic monopole .    to obtain the electromagnetic field developed in the system in response to the charge @xmath65 we introduce the electric and magnetic field strengths @xmath66 and @xmath67 together with electric and magnetic inductions @xmath68 and @xmath69 . the index @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) refers to the half - space @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) separated by the qh system .",

    "the image magnetic monopole effect can be understood from two equivalent perspectives .",

    "we discussed the rg flow and the phase diagram in great detail . to this end",
    ", the semiclassical conductivity tensor of dirac fermions in magnetic field was derived in sec .",
    "[ sec : startingvalues ] . 7 .   finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : experiment ] we carried out an analysis of conditions for experimental observation of the half - integer qhe .",
    "we have paid particular attention to implications of the slab geometry characteristic for currently manufactured ti samples .",
    "we conclude the paper with a few remarks of a more general character :    * first , we would like to comment on the issue of a physically observable topological @xmath1 invariant of 3d tis that has been discussed in the literature .",
    "it has been argued that the theta angle @xmath54 of the bulk @xmath4-term plays this role .",
    "we have shown that in the presence of a boundary , this angle gives rise to a topological angle @xmath461 of the boundary nl@xmath2 m theory . while this angle is indeed a @xmath1 invariant , it does not couple to gauge potentials and thus does not directly represent a measurable quantity .",
    "the situation should be contrasted to the paradigmatic case of the qh effect where the hall conductivity which is the topological invariant directly corresponds to the theta angle of the theory . in the present case",
    ", the role of the angle @xmath312 is in shifting the rg flow diagram ( and thus the fixed - point values of the hall conductivity ) .",
    "such an indirect physical meaning of topological invariants might be applicable also to other symmetry classes .",
    "* we hope that our work will motivate further experimental efforts for the observation of half - integer qhe in surfaces of 3d tis .",
    "it is also worth emphasizing that the tme is not specific to to 3d ti surfaces but should also take place in conventional qh systems .",
    "there , the parameter regime might be more favorable ( allowing in particular a higher number of charges on the probing tip ) .",
    "corresponding experimental studies would be certainly of great interest .",
    "* some of our results on transport properties of 2d dirac fermions may be relevant also in a context more general than ti surfaces .",
    "in particular , the peculiar critical behavior of the @xmath462 qh transition ( sec .  [",

    "further , the calculation of the semiclassical transport coefficients ( that served as starting values for the rg ) in sec .",
    "[ sec : startingvalues ] and app .",
    "[ sec : app : classicaltheory ] is generic and applies to any 2d material with a non - vanishing berry curvature .",
    "* finally , it is worth emphasizing that even though topological insulators avoid the fermion doubling theorem @xcite by spatially separating two single dirac or majorana modes , the gauge invariance still implies strong constraints .",
    "specifically , the anomalous contributions of the two surfaces mutually cancel , both in the analysis of laughlin s argument , sec.[sec : laughlin ] , and of the parity anomaly , sec .",
    "[ sec : nlsm : parity ] .",
    "such an additive cancellation of anomalies from opposite boundary states also occurs , e.g. , in the context of topological josephson junctions.@xcite in this reasoning , the fermion doubling plays a crucial role ( even though the two species are spatially separated ) . on the other hand",
    ", one could also regard the dirac ( or majorana ) fermions on the whole boundary of tis in dimensions larger than one as a single mode . in the context of 3d tis , it is instructive to imagine a sample of , e.g. , spherical form",
    ". then the notion of fermion doubling loses its meaning , as there is just a single species of dirac fermions on the whole closed boundary of the sample . nevertheless , as we discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : nlsm : parity ] , the theory is internally consistent and the parity anomaly is avoided .",
    "local response properties are controlled by a theory of a single species of dirac fermions , and the theory is unambiguously defined due to the fact that surface is a closed manifold .",
    "we therefore conclude that the reason for single - species dirac fermions to appear only on boundaries of higher - dimensional bulk systems ( which themselves have no boundary ) is very deep and ultimately follows from gauge invariance .",
