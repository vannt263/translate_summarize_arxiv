    "casimir s computation of the force between two neutral , parallel conducting plates@xcite originally inspired much theoretical interest as macroscopic manifestation of quantum fluctuation of the field in vacuum .",
    "however , the casimir force arises not only in the presence of material boundaries , but also in spaces with non - euclidean topology@xcite and the attractive or repulsive nature of the casimir force may depend on the topology of spacetime .",
    "the simplest example of the casimir effect of topological origin is the scalar field on a flat manifold with topology of a circle @xmath2 .",
    "the topology of @xmath2 causes the periodicity condition @xmath3 for a hermitian scale field @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the circumference of @xmath2 , imposed on the wave function which is of the same kind as those due to boundary and resulting in an attractive casimir force .",
    "similarly , the antiperiodic conditions can be drawn on a mbius strip and bring about the repulsive casimir force as a result .",
    "recently , the topology of the helix boundary conditions is investigated in ref.@xcite .",
    "we find that the casimir force is very much like the force on a spring that obeys the hooke s law in mechanics .",
    "however , in this case , the force comes from a quantum effect , so we would like to call this structure a quantum spring .",
    "the force is attractive in both massless and massive scalar cases for this structure@xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the concept of quotient topology is very useful for concrete application .",
    "we consider a surjective mapping @xmath6 from a topological space @xmath7 onto a set @xmath8 .",
    "the quotient topology on @xmath8 with respect to @xmath6 is given in @xcite .",
    "surjective mapping can be easily obtained when we use the equivalence classes of some equivalence relation @xmath9 .",
    "thus , we let @xmath10 denote the set of equivalence classes and define @xmath11 by @xmath12 $ ] the equivalence class containing @xmath13 . @xmath10 with the quotient topology is called to be obtained from @xmath7 by topological identification . for example , if we take the unit square @xmath14 in @xmath15 with the induced topology and define an equivalence relation @xmath9 on @xmath16 by @xmath17 then @xmath18 with the quotient topology is homomorphic to the cylinder @xmath5",
    "@xmath19 the boundary condition @xmath20 can be drawn on a cylinder .",
    "the @xmath21-function regularization procedure is a powerful and elegant technique for the casimir effect .",
    "rigorous extension of the proof of epstein @xmath21-function regularization has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "vacuum polarization in the background of on string was first considered in @xcite .",
    "the generalized @xmath21-function has many interesting applications , e.g. , in the piecewise string @xcite .",
    "similar analysis has been applied to cosmology entropy @xcite , p - branes @xcite , rectangular cavity @xcite , or pistons @xcite .",
    "casimir effect for a fermionic field is of interest in considering , for example , the structure of proton in particle physics @xcite while the thermofield dynamics of casimir effect for dirac fermion fields has been studied @xcite and recently for majorana fermion fields @xcite .",
    "the casimir piston of fermion is also studied @xcite . and",

    ", we consider the fermionic casimir effect under a new type of space - time topology using the concept of quotient topology .",
    "the relation between the new helix topology and that we use in @xcite is something like that between a mbius strip and a cylindric .",
    "we obtain the exact results of the casimir energy and casimir force for the massless and massive dirac fields in the ( @xmath0)-dimensional space - time .",
    "as mentioned in sec .",
    "1 , the casimir effect arises not only in presence of material boundaries , but also in space with nontrivial topology .",
    "we consider topological space @xmath7 as follows @xmath22 in @xmath23 with the induced topology and define an equivalence relation @xmath9 on @xmath7 by @xmath24 then @xmath10 with the quotient topology is homomorphic to helix topology . here ,",
    "@xmath25 and unit cylinder - cell @xmath26 @xcite are @xmath27 and @xmath28 where @xmath29 .",
    "next , we discuss what are referred to as anti - helix conditions imposed on a field @xmath30 , @xmath31 where the field returns to the same value after traveling distances @xmath32 at the @xmath33-direction and @xmath34 at the @xmath35-direction .",
    "it is notable that a spinor wave function is anti - helix and takes its initial value after traveling distances @xmath32 and @xmath34 respectively . in other words ,",
    "the anti - helix conditions are imposed on the field , which returns to the same field value @xmath36 only after two round trips .",
    "therefore , the boundary condition ( 7 ) can be induced by @xmath10 with the quotient topology .    in calculations on the casimir effect",
