    "tripartite entanglement is more complicated than bipartite entanglement .",

    "the decomposition taking the minimum @xmath14 is call the optimal decomposition , and if we know the optimal decomposition of @xmath13 , then we can get the entanglement @xmath15 . one can proof that our mixed state @xmath13 can be disassembled by the pure state @xmath16 .    to get the optimal decomposition of a state , we need to answer two questions : first , what is number of pure states of the optimal decomposition ?",
    "second , which is those pure states ? to the first question",
    ", caratheodory s theorem@xcite said that 4 pure states are sufficient to minimize the entanglement for rank-2 states .",
    "hence we need to investigate decompositions with 2,3 , or 4 pure states .    to answer the second question and consider the symmetry properties of @xmath17 and @xmath18 to three parties , we assume that the entanglement of @xmath19 is a periodical function of @xmath20 with period @xmath21 . by the assumption that the entanglement of @xmath19 is a periodical function of @xmath20 with period @xmath21 for a fixed @xmath22 , we assume @xmath23 get minimal value when @xmath24 .",
