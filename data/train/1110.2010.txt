    "the cold cepheids located close to the red edge of the classical instability strip have a large surface convective zone that affects their pulsation properties ( e.g. the reviews of * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the first calculations , that assumed _ frozen - in _ convection , predicted a cooler red edge than the observed one .",
    "indeed , as already stated by @xcite , a non - adiabatic treatment of the convection - pulsation coupling is mandatory to predict the red edge location with a better accuracy .",
    "several time - dependent convection ( tdc ) models were therefore developed to address this coupling ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and succeeded in reproducing the correct location of the red edge , despite their disagreements with the physical origin of the mode stabilisation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , all these formulations involve many free and degenerate parameters ( e.g. the seven dimensionless @xmath0 coefficients used by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that are either fitted to the observations or hardly constrained by theoretical values",
    ". nevertheless , another way to tackle this problem is to compute 2-d and 3-d direct numerical simulations ( dns ) that correctly take into account the nonlinearities involved in this coupling .",
    "results of such pioneering 2-d nonlinear simulations of the convection - pulsation coupling are presented in the following .",
    "our system corresponds to a local zoom around an ionisation region responsible for the driving of the acoustic modes excited by the @xmath1-mechanism .",
    "it is composed of a 2-d cartesian layer filled with a monatomic and perfect gas .",
    "the opacity bump associated with this ionisation zone is modelled by a temperature - dependent radiative conductivity profile @xmath2 ( for further details , see * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to the @xmath1-mechanism , the conductivity profile is deep enough to locally get a superadiabatic temperature gradient , meaning that convective motions develop there , according to schwarzschild s criterion .",
    "a strong coupling between convection and the acoustic oscillations therefore develops .",
    "the hydrodynamical equations are then advanced in time with the high - order , finite - difference _ _ pencil code _ _ , which is fully explicit except for the radiative diffusion term that is solved implicitly thanks to a parallel alternate direction implicit ( adi ) solver of our own @xcite .",
    "the simulation box spans about @xmath3 of the star radius around the ionisation region . in order to ensure that both the thermal relaxation and nonlinear saturation of the @xmath1-mechanism are achieved ,",
    "the simulations are computed over more than 4000 days ( corresponding roughly to 1500 periods of oscillation , see * ? ? ?",
    "in the g8 ( * a * ) and in the g8h8 simulations ( * b*).,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    figure  [ snapshot ] displays a snapshot of the vorticity field for two simulations discussed in @xcite , namely g8 ( upper panel ) and g8h8 ( lower panel ) .",
    "this vorticity field highlights the convective motions that are approximately localised in the middle of the layer , where the radiative conductivity is minimum .",
    "differences in the typical length - scale of convection are noticeable between these two dns : convective eddies are smaller scale in the g8 simulation than in the g8h8 one .",
    "accordingly , the overshooting of convective elements into the lower stably stratified layer is also more pronounced in the latter simulation .    beyond these qualitative differences ,",
    "a good way to compare these simulations is to study the temporal evolution of average quantities , such as the vertical mass flux @xmath4 . indeed , as we are considering simulations with both convective motions and oscillations of acoustic modes , it is relevant to use a simple diagnostic that roughly separates their relative contributions . because the convective plumes have both ascending and descending motions , the average vertical mass flux filters out their contribution and is therefore a good proxy of the amplitude of the acoustic modes .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "[ ts ] therefore displays the temporal evolution of @xmath4 for the two simulations discussed before .",
    "an oscillatory behaviour is observed in both cases due to the radial oscillations of the fundamental acoustic mode excited by @xmath1-mechanism . in the g8 simulation",
    ", the amplitude first grows exponentially until reaching the nonlinear saturation regime . at first glance",
    ", this time evolution looks very similar to what has been already observed in our former purely radiative simulations done in @xcite , that is , a linear growth of the amplitude and a saturation at a well - defined value .",
    "in contrast , the dynamics of the g8h8 simulation differ radically from the previous one as the amplitude remains weak and is highly modulated over time .",
    "no clear nonlinear saturation is observed in this case , meaning that the acoustic oscillations are more influenced by convective motions than in the previous dns .",
    "for the two simulations g8 ( solid blue line ) and g8h8 ( solid green line ) .",

    "thanks to this formalism , it is possible to extract the time evolution of the kinetic energy contained in each acoustic mode found in the nonlinear simulation . the right panel of fig .",
    "[ ts ] displays the time evolution of the energy contained in the fundamental acoustic mode normalised by the total kinetic energy . in the g8 simulation ,",
    "the acoustic energy linearly increases until its nonlinear saturation , in a similar way to what has been previously observed with the time evolution of @xmath4 .",
    "once this saturation is reached , @xmath5 of the kinetic energy is contained in the radial oscillations of the fundamental acoustic mode , while the remaining is in the convective plumes .",
    "in other words , the acoustic oscillations are not affected much by the convective motions in this simulation .",
    "in contrast , this acoustic energy ratio remains very weak in the other simulation . despite some transient increases during which non - trifling values ( @xmath6 ) are obtained , the average ratio is less than @xmath7 , and convective motions contains the bulk of the kinetic energy . in this case ,",
    "the radial oscillations excited by the @xmath1-mechanism are thus quenched by convective plumes .",
    "this situation is relevant to the physics of cepheids close to the red edge of the instability strip , where the unstable acoustic modes are supposed to be damped by the surface convective motions .",
    "this convective quenching of the acoustic oscillations may be the direct signature of the different density contrasts in the g8 and the g8h8 simulations : in fact , weaker stratification ( as in g8h8 ) leads to bigger vortices ( see fig .",
    "[ snapshot]b ) , meaning that the energy is contained in larger convective structures . in our dns , the amplitude of the @xmath1-mechanism seems to be controlled by the screening effect due to these large convective vortices @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear simulations of the convection - pulsation coupling , where the acoustic modes strongly modulate the convective motions over time ( as in the g8 simulation ) are also good candidates to test and compare the relevance of different prescriptions of 1-d time - dependent convection ( tdc ) models .",
    "we focus here on two popular formulations widely used in cepheids models , namely the tdc models of @xcite and @xcite . in these formulations , a single equation for the turbulent kinetic energy @xmath8",
    "is added to the classical mean - field equations and the main second - order correlations , such as the convective flux , are expressed as a function of @xmath8 only :    @xmath9    where @xmath10 , @xmath11 and    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the pressure , @xmath14 the density , and the brackets denote a horizontal average .",
    "these two tdc expressions involves one dimensionless parameter @xmath15 ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively ) that is poorly constrained by theory @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear results of the g8 simulation allow us to constraint it by using the @xmath18-statistics so that to obtain its optimum value for each formulation .",
    "figure  [ flux ] compares the convective flux in the dns with the two tdc prescriptions computed with the best - fit values obtained for @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "stellingwerf s formulation seems to give a better agreement with the nonlinear simulation than kuhfu s one .",
    "indeed , the kuhfu  model overestimates the overshooting as the ( negative ) convective flux remains non - negligible until the bottom of the radiative zone .",
    "in contrast , the stellingwerf profile accounts for the local penetration of convective plumes better and shows the expected exponential - like decay in the negative convective flux when sinking in the radiative zone .",
    "however , the two models are fairly similar in the bulk of the convective zone , where convection is fully developed .",
    "one also notes that they both predict a negative flux at the top of the convective zone , which is an upper overshooting of convective motions near the surface that is not observed in the dns .",
    "the main weakness of all theories of 1-d time - dependent convection lies in the large number of free parameters involved in the description of convection .",
    "new constraints must therefore be found to reduce the intrinsic degeneracy of these models and to check the relevance of the different assumptions underlying these parametrisations .",
    "nonlinear 2-d direct numerical simulations are a useful way to address the convection - pulsation coupling that occurs in cold cepheids .",
    "these simulations show a variable influence of convection onto the acoustic modes excited by @xmath1-mechanism : ( _ i _ ) either the amplitude of the acoustic modes remains very weak and convective motions quench the oscillations ; ( _ ii _ ) or the kinetic energy is mainly contained in the acoustic modes and convective plumes are strongly modulated over time by the radial oscillations . while the former situation is relevant to the stabilisation of the oscillations of cepheids close to their red edge",
    ", the latter is a good candidate to draw the limits of current tdc recipes .",
    "focusing on two such widely used models , stellingwerf s formulation is found to give a better agreement with the nonlinear results than does kuhfu s .",
    "this first comparison of tdc theories with fully nonlinear results coming from 2-d direct simulations of the convection - pulsation coupling emphasises how dns can be helpful to validate and improve 1-d models of time - dependent convection ."
