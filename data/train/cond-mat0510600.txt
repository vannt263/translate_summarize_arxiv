    "the increase of @xmath23 with measurement frequency is a hallmark of glassy systems@xcite .",
    "the fact that @xmath65 decreases below @xmath23(17ghz)@xmath2420  k while @xmath64 continues to increase indicates that the `` edwards - anderson order parameter''@xcite distributes only along lines such as the ( 1@xmath580 ) . in conventional spin - glasses , the `` edwards - anderson order parameter '' is more isotropically distributed in the * q*-space@xcite .",

    "this picture offers a possible alternative to the conventional competing antiferromagnetic / ferromagnetic interaction model for spin freezing in doped cuprates .",
    "in addition , it suggests that the weak interlayer exchange interaction likely plays an important role in the finite temperature spin - glass transition in the quasi-2d heisenberg magnetic systems .",
    "another important difference from conventional spin - glasses in which all spins are believe to freeze at low temperature is that only a fraction of spins freeze in la@xmath0cu@xmath1li@xmath2o@xmath3 .",
    "other spins in 2d correlations remain fluctuating down to 1.5  k. this is consistent with numerical evidence that quantum fluctuations prevent spin - glass transition for 2d @xmath4=1/2 heisenberg system@xcite .",
    "the spin - glass component in our sample has to acquire interlayer correlations to achieve a higher dimension in order to be realized .",
    "it appears that the lower critical dimension for a @xmath4=1/2 heisenberg quantum spin glass is between 2 and 3 .",
    "a further difference from conventional spin - glasses , for which one can measure the narrowing of magnetic spectrum toward @xmath41=0@xcite , is that when @xmath71 and @xmath72 in la@xmath0cu@xmath1li@xmath2o@xmath3 become detectable at about 150  k , they are already energy - resolution - limited , with spins fluctuating much slower than 17 ghz .",
    "this property of @xmath71 and @xmath72 resembles the classic central peak phenomenon in the soft phonon transition@xcite .",
    "the disparate dynamics of the central peak and phonon are explained by halperin and varma@xcite using a phase separation model : defect cells contribute to the slow relaxing central peak while coherent lattice motions ( phonons ) to the resolved inelastic channel .",
    "this mechanism has been applied with success to a wide class of disordered relaxor ferroelectrics@xcite .    for la@xmath0cu@xmath1li@xmath2o@xmath3",
    ", we envision that disorder accompanying doping prevents the long - range order of the antiferromagnetic phase mainly by upsetting interlayer magnetic phase coherence , see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for the * q*-distribution of frozen spins",
    ". this upsetting is not uniform in the griffiths fashion@xcite with weak and strong coupling parts in the sample . in our laminar material ,",
    "however , the weak and strong coupling parts have different dimensionality : 2d and nearly 3d , respectively .",
    "the 2d part is a spin liquid and represents essentially the whole system at high temperature , see fig .",
    "part of sample with stronger interplane coupling tends to order three dimensionally below @xmath10150  k , producing @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the condensation of the 2d spin liquid at @xmath10 150  k into the quasi-3d dynamic clusters of diminishing energy scale , instead of a true long - range order , may reflect the divergent fluctuations which destabilize static order at finite temperature for 2d random @xmath86 or heisenberg systems@xcite .",
    "the nearly 3d spin - glass instead of a 3d antiferromagnet finally orders at a much reduced @xmath87  k , when @xmath88 approaches the 2d spectral weight ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the coexistence of spin liquid and spin glass components at low temperatures may be a general consequence of no `` mobility edge '' separating finite and infinite range correlations for a 2d random system@xcite .",
    "recently , monte - carlo simulations of a doped 2d classical antiferromagnet suggest that there are two populations of spins : one with fast and the other with slow dynamics@xcite .",
    "this is consistent with our experimental results and the griffiths picture for random magnetic systems . a phenomenological halperin and varma model",
    "may be built for spin dynamics in doped cuprates based on these microscopic insights .    in summary , spins in la@xmath0cu@xmath1li@xmath2o@xmath3 develop _ dynamic _ antiferromagnetic order in the cuo@xmath0 plane with very long @xmath89 below 180  k. the characteristic energy of the 2d spin fluctuations is 0.18@xmath90 for @xmath91  k and 1  mev for @xmath92  k@xcite .",

    "a theory of spin - glass in doped cuprates should include interlayer coupling .",
