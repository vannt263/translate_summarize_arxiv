    "the ising model in @xmath15 dimension with long - range interactions decaying with distance @xmath0 as @xmath16 has been much studied .",
    "dyson @xcite showed that there is no phase transition for @xmath17 , while there is long - range order at low temperatures when the interactions are ferromagnetic and @xmath18 .",
    "the borderline case of @xmath19 was studied by several authors @xcite , who found a one - dimensional version of the kosterlitz - thouless transition @xcite in the system .",
    "a variety of methods have been used to show that the transition is of second - order with continuously varying critical exponents in the region @xmath20 . for @xmath21",
    ", it has been found that the critical exponents are mean field like for thermodynamic quantities , but the spin - spin correlations at the critical temperature @xmath22 have a non - classical critical exponent @xmath23 .",
    "the case @xmath24 is somewhat special in that the mean field exponents are modified by logarithmic corrections @xcite in analogy to the situation with the short range ising model for @xmath25 , or the @xmath26 ising model with dipolar interactions @xcite .",
    "the case @xmath27 does not appear to have been investigated except for @xmath28 .",
    "the reason , perhaps , is the fact that the interaction potential , @xmath29 , becomes nonintegrable for @xmath27 and then the energy of the system is non - extensive .",
    "the textbook example of @xmath30 has attracted much attention since it corresponds to an ising model in which every spin interacts equally with every other spin .",
    "the problem of non - extensive energy is solved by rescaling the coupling strength by the number of spins and the result is a mean - field exact solution .",
    "spatial correlations have no meaning in this system .",
    "for @xmath31 and @xmath32 one can still consider spatial correlations and this is what we shall do in this paper .",
    "the reason for doing it is partly the fact that there are interactions in nature which are non - integrable .",
    "the gravitational interaction is a prominent example but there are many systems which contain topological defects with non - integrable effective interactions between the defects . our original motivation , however , comes from the studies of nonequilibrium steady states .",
    "the main difficulty with nonequilibrium steady states is that their properties depend not only on the interactions but also on the details of the underlying dynamics . in order to get a handle on the effect of dynamics",
    ", there has been several works in which the goal was to determine the effective interactions which are generated by the interplay of various dynamical processes . a way to achieve this goal",
    "is to investigate the phase transitions occurring in nonequilibrium steady states and deduce the effective interactions from the universality class the transitions fall into .",
    "for example , a combination of spin - flips and levy - flight spin exchanges in a @xmath15 kinetic ising model produces a steady state with effective long - range interactions and this steady state displays a critical phase transition . in this case , the large - distance behavior of the interactions @xmath16 can be deduced @xcite from measuring critical exponents .",
    "of course , this can be done only if @xmath33 is in a range @xmath34 where either the thermodynamic exponents or the correlation exponent @xmath35 depend on @xmath33 . in order to extend this method to non - integrable interactions",
    "@xmath36 , we must investigate the correlations since measuring thermodynamic exponents yield mean - field values independently of @xmath33 .",
    "thus , we can see that in order to extract information about non - integrable effective interactions in nonequilibrium steady states , we must first understand the _ equilibrium _ correlations in systems with non - integrable interactions .",
    "since mean - field theory is expected to describe the critical behavior correctly for @xmath31 , we used it to calculate the correlations for finite size systems ( section [ meanf ] ) .",
    "our main result is that the singular part of the correlations appears to have universal features which make it useful in deducing effective interactions in nonequilibrium steady states .",
    "we check our mean - field results against simulations in section [ montec ] and a final discussion is given in section [ final ] .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional ising model of @xmath37 spins @xmath38 at sites @xmath39 and impose periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the energy of the system is given by @xmath40 and the interaction is assumed to decay with distance as a power law but it is cut off at @xmath41 : @xmath42 here @xmath43 and the parameter @xmath33 is assumed to be in the range @xmath44 .",
    "the inhomogeneous external field , @xmath45 is included in order to calculate the susceptibility @xmath46 which , at temperature @xmath47 , is related to the two - spin correlation function @xmath48 through @xmath49 where @xmath50 means that the susceptibility and , consequently , the correlation functions are evaluated in the limit of vanishing fields .    in the mean - field approximation , @xmath51 is obtained from the self - consistency equation for the average magnetization : @xmath52 taking a derivative of both sides of this equation with respect to @xmath53 and letting @xmath50 , we obtain @xmath54 ( 1-\\langle s_i \\rangle^2 ) \\quad .",
    "\\label{cij}\\ ] ] equations ( [ tanh ] ) and ( [ cij ] ) from a closed set of equations for @xmath55 and @xmath56 . in zero field ,",
    "the system is expected to be homogeneous and thus @xmath57 and @xmath58 where @xmath59 is given by the stable solution of ( [ tanh ] ) . assuming this homogeneity , equation ( [ cij ] ) is solved by fourier transformation . introducing @xmath60 one finds @xmath61 where j(k ) is the fourier transform of @xmath62 .",
    "up to this point , the derivation followed along standard lines .",
    "the non - integrability of the interaction starts to play role when we try to find the critical temperature , @xmath63 .",
    "since @xmath64 is proportional to the fluctuation of magnetization , its divergence determines @xmath63 in the thermodynamic limit @xmath65 . thus setting @xmath66 in eq.([cfourier ] )",
    "one finds @xmath67 the problem with the above expression is that the sum diverges as @xmath68 for @xmath31 .",
    "thus , in order to have a thermodynamic limit for the correlation functions , we either have to divide @xmath69 by @xmath68 or have to consider temperatures which are proportional to @xmath68 .",
    "since only the ratio @xmath70 enters the expressions , the two routes are equivalent . introducing @xmath71 and @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is defined through the sum in ( @xmath74 ) without taking the @xmath65 limit",
    ", we obtain the spatial correlation function from the inverse fourier transform of ( [ cfourier ] ) : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is given by @xmath77 one can see that correlations in the low- and high - temperature phases are simply related by rescaling the temperature and the amplitude by @xmath78 @xcite . for this reason we shall consider only the high - temperature phase and the critical point and thus set @xmath66 and @xmath79 .    equations ( [ cn ] ) and ( [ qn ] ) can be easily evaluated numerically and the mean - field results can be compared to mc simulations ( see next section ) .",
    "first , however , we shall discuss the analytic properties of @xmath80 in the  thermodynamic limit \" where @xmath65 .",
    "as can be seen from ( [ cn ] ) the average of @xmath80 over @xmath81 is given by @xmath82^{-1}$ ] and is negligible for @xmath83 .",
    "the part of @xmath80 which remains after subtracting the average also diminishes but with a smaller exponent .",
    "it is of the order of @xmath84 and thus no spatial correlations remain in the @xmath65 limit for @xmath31 .",
    "it turns out , however , that the correlation function has an interesting singular behavior for small @xmath85 which can be well observed in finite - size systems .",
    "we shall investigate this spatial dependence by amplifying it through subtracting the average part of @xmath80 and multiplying the result by @xmath86 : @xmath87 the function @xmath76 is finite and can be evaluated exactly in the @xmath65 limit @xmath88 where @xmath89 denotes the gamma function .",
    "thus we can take the upper limit of the sum in ( [ phi ] ) to infinity and find a scaling function , @xmath90 , which is independent of @xmath91 .",
    "the singular part of @xmath90 in the limit @xmath10 is calculated by first noting that the identity @xmath92 is valid for any @xmath93 that can be written as @xmath94 where @xmath81 is an integer not divisible by @xmath86 . using this identity , the sum in ( [ phi ] )",
    "can be rewritten so that it contains the expression @xmath95 .",
    "this expression is then expanded in @xmath96 and , finally , the sums over @xmath97 are changed into integrals .",
    "the number of singular terms obtained in this way depends on @xmath33 and , for @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is an integer , we find : @xmath100 the coefficients @xmath101 can be calculated explicitly .",
    "for example , the coefficient of the strongest singularity , @xmath102 , is given by @xmath103 if @xmath104 then the last term in ( [ phising ] ) changes from power - law singularity into a term of logarithmic singularity , @xmath105 .",
    "for example , the case @xmath106 yields the following singular part @xmath107 one can compare @xmath108 calculated for @xmath109 and @xmath110 from the exact sum with e.g. @xmath111 and @xmath112 obtained from ( [ phi1/2 ] ) .",
    "one then finds that @xmath113 is constant @xmath114 to an accuracy of the order of @xmath115 .",
    "thus the singular part plus a constant represents the exact solution to a very good accuracy over the entire range , @xmath116 , which is relevant physically .",
    "we checked the  singular - terms - plus - constant \" description for other values of @xmath33 and found that the accuracy decreases as @xmath117 decreases .",
    "for example , in order to achieve a @xmath115 accuracy at @xmath118 and @xmath119 , one must also include an additional term and write @xmath120 .",
    "next , we turn to the calculation of @xmath90 at the critical point ( @xmath119 ) . in systems with short - range interactions ,",
    "the decay of correlations changes from exponential to power law as the critical point is reached .",
    "systems with long - range , integrable interactions ( @xmath121 ) have power - law correlations already in the high temperature phase and the change that occurs in these systems when @xmath63 is approached is that the exponent of the power law decay changes ( becomes smaller at @xmath63 ) .",
    "for example , in the exactly solvable spherical model @xcite , @xmath122 for @xmath123 and @xmath124 at @xmath63 . as we shall see below , the non - integrable systems are different from the cases discussed above in the sense that the singular structure of @xmath80 does not change when @xmath119 is reached . the scaling function @xmath125 at criticality",
    "is obtained by just setting @xmath119 in eq.([phising ] ) .    the first question that arises when the @xmath119 case is considered is the infinity of the @xmath126 term which has been subtracted from @xmath127 in the definition of @xmath128 ( see ( [ phi ] ) ) .",
    "since this term is the sum of the correlation function , it is equal to the magnetization fluctuation : @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the total magnetization of the system .",
    "thus , at the critical point , @xmath131 does not diverge in a finite - size system , it just changes from a quantity of @xmath132 to @xmath133 where @xmath134 in the mean - field theory .",
    "the apparent singularity of @xmath126 is the result of effectively linearizing eq.([tanh ] ) when using eq.([fluctdiss ] ) for calculating the correlation function . for our purpose of calculating @xmath128 , the real or apparent singularity of @xmath64 does not pose a difficulty since @xmath128 is defined after subtracting @xmath64 from the correlation function .",
    "note that @xmath9 is well defined physically : it is the correlation function after the average has been subtracted .",
    "the second question that has to be answered for @xmath119 is whether any of the terms in the sum ( [ phi ] ) defining @xmath128 becomes singular in the @xmath135 limit ( after all @xmath126 was a term in this sum before being treated separately and , in general , one may expect long - wavelength singularities at the critical point ) .",
    "the answer to this question is _ no _ and the reason for the absence of singularities is that long - range interactions develop a gap in the  fluctuation spectrum \" of the system . in order to see how this happen and why non - integrable interactions are different from the short - range ones , let us examine the denominator of the terms in the sum in eq.([cn ] ) . for short - range , e.g. nearest - neighbor , interactions one finds in the long - wavelength limit @xmath136",
    "one can see that the above expression is nonzero for @xmath137 while it goes to zero at @xmath119 as the square of the wavenumber ( for @xmath65 ) .",
    "this is the origin of the exponential ( power law ) decay of _ large - distance _ correlations at @xmath138 ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "the structure of the denominator changes for non - integrable potentials ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "it becomes independent of @xmath91 for @xmath65 and , using ( [ qninf ] ) , one finds @xmath139 since @xmath140 for @xmath44 ( @xmath141 only for @xmath142 ) , the denominator in ( [ denom2 ] ) is nonzero even for the smallest @xmath143 at @xmath144 .",
    "thus , there is a gap in the spectrum of magnetization fluctuations for all wavenumbers , and the singularity of the scaling function @xmath9 at _ small _ arguments ( small distances ) comes from the non - analytic structure of the denominator at large wave - numbers .",
    "it should be noted that the above argument also holds in the low - temperature phase after replacing @xmath96 by @xmath145 and using the fact that @xmath146 @xcite .",
    "it is clear from the above discussion that @xmath119 can be set in the sum ( [ phi ] ) for evaluating @xmath9 , and it is also clear that the result for the singular part @xmath147 is given by eq.([phising ] ) with @xmath119 .",
    "one can again compare @xmath147 and @xmath128 , the latter evaluated for large but finite systems and one again finds @xmath115 accuracy with the @xmath148 description at @xmath109 .",
    "the trends with the accuracy of the singular - part description is also the same for @xmath119 as in the case of @xmath137 discussed above .",
    "in this section , we describe the results of addressing the following question : do the results of the mean - field calculation remain valid when fluctuations are included ?",
    "since no exact solutions are available , we studied the problem by performing mc simulations on the long - range ising model described at the beginning of section ii .",
    "we considered cases of @xmath11 and @xmath12 at both @xmath110 and @xmath149 .",
    "single - spin - flip dynamics with metropolis flip rates was used and we studied systems of sizes @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "after an initial estimate of the relaxation times , we let the system equilibrate and the equilibrium correlations were calculated and analyzed .",
    "apart from the usual difficulties of simulating a system with long - range interactions ( calculating the energy changes is time - consuming and no cluster algorithms can be used to reduce critical slowing down ) , there is one extra problem when a @xmath31 system is simulated .",
    "namely , the definition of the @xmath119 critical point is not quite obvious .",
    "the mean - field @xmath152 defined in ( [ tc ] ) has the right asymptotics for @xmath65 but for a finite @xmath91 , @xmath63 has corrections due to fluctuations . for a sequence of systems of increasing size , one can , in principle , use any sequence of @xmath73 which is approaching @xmath152 in the thermodynamic limit . in practice , we defined @xmath73 as the temperature where the macroscopic magnetization fluctuations have the large-@xmath91 behavior that follows from mean - field theory , namely @xmath153 . since @xmath154 , the above choice means that we approach the @xmath155 critical point as @xmath156^{-1/2}$ ] .",
    "the same correction can also be made in the mean - field calculation .",
    "this correction , however , is small and would not be visible in the figures discussed below .",
    "fig.1 displays the raw data for the correlation function @xmath80 at @xmath109 and @xmath157 . after subtracting the average correlation and multiplying the result by @xmath86 ( i.e. calculating @xmath128 ) we obtain a collapse of data ( fig.2 ) if @xmath128 is plotted against @xmath85 .",
    "a blow - up of the small @xmath93 region is shown in fig.3 .    in fig.4 ,",
    "the mc data is compared with @xmath9 calculated from the mean - field theory of sec.ii , and we observe excellent agreement between simulations and theory . on fig.5 , we can see similar agreement away from the critical point @xmath158 for the case of @xmath109 . we have also performed simulations with @xmath159 at both @xmath110 and @xmath157 and we again observed both the scaling of the data when @xmath9 vs. @xmath93 was plotted as well as the agreement between mc and mean - field results .",
    "thus we conclude that the mean - field theory presented in sec.ii correctly describes the correlations of ising models in which the interactions are of long - range , power law form @xmath160 with @xmath44 .",
    "the main conclusions of our work are that ( i ) the mean - field theory provides us with explicit expressions for the correlation function in case of nonintegrable interactions and ( ii ) the singularity of the correlations for a given @xmath33 has the same structure at all temperatures .",
    "the results appear to be not affected by fluctuations as indicated by monte carlo simulations for particular values of @xmath33 and @xmath161 .",
    "we expect that the mean - field theory is also correct for higher dimensional systems where the fluctuations play even less role .",
