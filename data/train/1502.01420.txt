    "nonlinear dynamics such as fast switching and self - oscillation ( limit cycle ) has been a fascinating topic in physics @xcite .",
    "magnetization dynamics excited by the spin transfer effect @xcite in a nanostructured ferromagnet @xcite provide fundamentally important examples of such nonlinear dynamics .",
    "the magnetization switching was first observed in co / cu metallic multilayer in 2000 @xcite .",
    "three years later , self - oscillation was reported in a similar system @xcite . in these early experiments on the spin transfer effect",
    ", linear analysis was used to estimate , for example , the critical current destabilizing the magnetization in equilibrium @xcite . however , recently it became clear that nonlinear analysis is necessary to quantitatively analyze the magnetization dynamics @xcite .",
    "for example , current density to excite self - oscillation can be evaluated by solving a nonlinear vector equation called the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation @xcite .",
    "originally , the spin transfer effect was studied by applying an electric current directly to a ferromagnetic multilayer . recently ,",
    "however , an alternative method employing the spin hall effect has been used to observe the spin transfer effect @xcite .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction in a nonmagnetic heavy metal scatters the spin - up and spin - down electrons to the opposite directions , producing a pure spin current flowing in the direction perpendicular to an applied current .",
    "the pure spin current excites the spin torque , called spin hall torque , on a magnetization in a ferromagnet attached to a nonmagnet .",
    "the direction of the spin hall torque is geometrically determined @xcite , and its magnitude shows a different angular dependence than the spin torque in the ferromagnetic multilayer @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is fundamentally unclear whether the physical phenomena observed in the multilayer @xcite can be reproduced in the spin hall system , and thus , new physical analysis is necessary .",
    "the magnetization switching of both in - plane magnetized and perpendicularly magnetized ferromagnets by spin hall torque was recently reported @xcite .",
    "accordingly , it might be reasonable to expect reports on self - oscillation by spin hall torque .",
    "however , whereas self - oscillation has been observed in the in - plane magnetized system @xcite , it has not been reported yet in the perpendicularly magnetized system .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the possibility of exciting self - oscillation by spin hall torque based on a nonlinear analysis of the llg equation .",
    "we argue that two physical conditions should be satisfied to excite self - oscillation .",
    "the first condition is that the energy that the spin torque supplies during a precession on a constant energy curve should equal the dissipation due to damping .",
    "the second condition is that the current to balance the spin torque and the damping torque in the self - oscillation state should be larger than the critical current to destabilize the initial state .",
    "this is because the magnetization initially stays at the minimum energy state , whereas the self - oscillation corresponds to a higher energy state .",
    "we derive exact solutions of the energy supplied by the spin transfer effect and the dissipation due to damping in the spin hall system by solving the nonlinear llg equation , and find that these conditions are not satisfied .",
    "thus , the self - oscillation of a perpendicular ferromagnet can not be excited solely by the spin hall torque .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . the physical conditions to excite a self - oscillation",
    "is summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : physical conditions to excite self - oscillation ] .",
    "these conditions are applied to the spin hall system in sec .",
    "[ sec : spin hall system ] .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] is devoted to the conclusions .",
    "let us first summarize the physical conditions necessary to excite self - oscillation .",
    "the magnetization dynamics are described by the llg equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the unit vectors pointing in the directions of the magnetization and the spin polarization of the spin current , respectively .",
    "the gyromagnetic ratio and the gilbert damping constant are denoted as @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath5 relates to the energy density of the ferromagnet @xmath6 via @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the saturation magnetization .",
    "the strength of the spin torque , @xmath9 , is proportional to the current density @xmath10 .",
    "since the llg equation conserves the norm of the magnetization , the magnetization dynamics can be described as a trajectory on a unit sphere .",
    "the energy density @xmath6 shows constant energy curves on this sphere .",
    "for example , when the system has uniaxial anisotropy , the constant energy curves are latitude lines . the self - oscillation is a steady precession state on a constant energy curve excited by the field torque , the first term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : llg ] ) .",
    "this means that the second and third terms of eq .",
    "( [ eq : llg ] ) , averaged over the constant energy curve , cancel each other . in other words ,",
    "the energy supplied by the spin transfer effect during the precession on the constant energy curve equals the dissipation due to the damping .",
    "this condition can be expressed as @xcite @xmath11 where the energy supplied by the spin transfer effect and the dissipation due to the damping during the precession on the constant energy curve of @xmath6 are given by @xcite @xmath12 ,    \\label{eq : melnikov_s}\\ ] ] @xmath13 .",

    "( [ eq : melnikov_s ] ) and ( [ eq : melnikov_alpha ] ) are functions of the energy density @xmath6 .",
    "we denote the minimum and maximum values of @xmath6 as @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "when the energy density also has saddle points @xmath16 , @xmath15 in the following discussion can be replaced by @xmath16 . to excite the self - oscillation , there should be a certain value of the electric current density that satisfies eq .",
    "( [ eq : condition ] ) for @xmath17 in a set of real numbers . therefore , eq . ( [ eq : condition ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath18 we denote the current satisfying the first condition , eq .",
    "( [ eq : condition ] ) , or equivalently eq . ( [ eq : condition_1 ] ) , as @xmath19 .",
    "another condition necessary to excite self - oscillation relates to the fact that the magnetization initially stays at the minimum energy state . to excite any kind of magnetization dynamics",
    ", the spin torque should destabilize the initial state , which means that a current density larger than the critical current density , @xmath20 , should be injected .",
    "then , the condition @xmath21 should be satisfied to excite the self - oscillation .",
    "if this condition is not satisfied , the magnetization directly moves to a constant energy curve including the saddle point without showing a stable steady precession , and stops dynamics because the spin torque does not balance the damping torque for @xmath22 .",
    "an example of such dynamics is shown below ; see fig . [",

    "we can assume that @xmath32 without losing generality because the sign of @xmath25 only affects the sign of @xmath19 derived below .",

    "figure [ fig : fig1 ] ( b ) schematically shows the precession trajectory of the magnetization on a constant energy curve , where the directions of the spin hall torque and the damping torque are represented by the solid and dotted arrows , respectively .",
    "the spin hall torque is parallel to the damping torque for @xmath34 , whereas it is anti - parallel to the damping torque for @xmath35 .",
    "this means that the spin hall torque dissipates energy from the ferromagnet when @xmath34 , and supplies the energy to the ferromagnet when @xmath35 .",
    "then , due to the symmetry of the trajectory , the net energy supplied by the spin hall torque , @xmath36 , is zero when the applied magnetic field points to the @xmath23- or @xmath26-direction .",
