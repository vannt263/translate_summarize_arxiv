    "non - locality ( i.e. , entanglement ) is one of the most profound features of quantum theory and plays an important role in quantum information processing , including quantum computation and quantum communication  @xcite .",
    "mathematically , an entangled pure state of a composite system is defined as a state that can not be factorized into a direct tensor product of the states associated with individual subsystems .",
    "the presence of multi - partite entanglement is necessary for implementing quantum algorithms that are exponentially faster than classical ones  @xcite .",
    "also , entanglement may offer some new information transfer modes , e.g. , teleportation and quantum cryptography  @xcite .",
    "therefore , generating and verifying entanglement between qubits are of great practical importance  @xcite .",
    "the existence of entanglement can be verified by using various experimental methods , e.g. , quantum tomographic techniques , bell - state analysis , quantum jump measurements , etc .",
    "( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "also , spectral analysis has been used to probe the existence of two - qubit entanglement in coupled josephson qubits  @xcite . however , the degree of entanglement between the two always - present interacting qubits changes rapidly  @xcite and , at certain times , two - qubit states can be almost separable .",
    "thus , verifying the instantaneously generated entangled state in coupled systems  @xcite , and using it to realize quantum information processing , e.g. , teleportation and quantum memory , are very important challenges .",
    "historically , bell s inequality always served as one of the most important witnesses of entanglement : its violation implies that entanglement must be shared by the separate parts . numerous experimental tests of bell s inequality have been made with entangled photons separated far apart ( e.g. , up to @xmath0 m )  @xcite and entangled _ closely - spaced _ trapped ions ( e.g. , _ separated a few micrometers apart _ )  @xcite .",
    "a bell - like inequality has also been tested via single - neutron interferometry by measuring the correlations between two entangled degrees of freedom ( comprising spatial and spin components ) of _ single _",
    "neutrons  @xcite .",
    "the results from these experiments strongly violate the tested bell s inequalities , and thus agree with quantum mechanical predictions .",
    "very recently , preliminary proposals have been explored for testing bell s inequalities with switchable josephson qubits  @xcite .",
    "almost all proposals for manipulating quantum information rely on the execution of both single - qubit and two - qubit gates . in some cases ( e.g. , trapped ions , qed cavities , and quantum dots  @xcite ) , single - qubit operations are easy to realize by applying certain controllable local fields .",
    "however , the interbit couplings are fixed and uncontrollable in current experimental josephson circuits  @xcite and nmr systems  @xcite . nevertheless , qubits in nmr are individually addressable , because the coupling constants @xmath1 between the @xmath2th and @xmath3th qubits are sufficiently weak ( i.e. , much smaller than the differences @xmath4 between the eigenfrequencies of the qubits , e.g. , @xmath5",
    "@xcite ) . however , the usual capacitive coupling in josephson circuits  @xcite is relatively strong , thus making it difficult to perform local single - qubit operations on individual qubits .",
    "the method  @xcite of physically arranging qubits ( i.e. , using two or three physical qubits to encode a logical qubit ) can not be directly used in the present two - qubit system .",
    "here we develop a new approach to overcome the serious  fixed - interaction \" difficulty and effectively implement desired single - qubit operations on selected qubits .",
    "this dynamical decoupling method can be used to generate long - lived entangled states in coupled josephson qubits .",
    "the long - lived entanglement obtained here , assisted by the proposed local single - qubit operations , should allow to test bell s inequality with a pair of capacitively coupled josephson qubits .",
    "its violation would provide another robust physical evidence of statistically nonlocal correlations at the macroscopic scale .     and external magnetic fluxes @xmath6 ( penetrating the squid loops ) . @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( dashed line parts ) read out the final qubit states.,width=514 ]",
    "we consider the nano - circuit sketched in fig .",
    "1 . this is similar to that in ref .",
    "@xcite , just replacing the left josephson junction there by a superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) loop with controllable josephson energy .",
    "the two cooper - pair boxes are coupled via the capacitance @xmath9 .",
    "the qubits work in the charge regime , with @xmath10(@xmath11 ) , where both quasi - particle tunnelling and excitations are effectively suppressed and the number @xmath12(with @xmath13 ) of cooper - pairs in the boxes is a good quantum number . here ,",
    "@xmath14 , and @xmath15 are the boltzmann constant , temperature , superconducting gap , the charging and josephson energies of the @xmath3th qubit , respectively . following refs .",
    "@xcite , the system is assumed to work near the co - resonant point and its quantum dynamics can be restricted to the subspace spanned by the four lowest charge states : @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian of this circuit is @xmath18+e_{12 } \\ ; \\sigma^{(1)}_{z}\\sigma^{(2)}_z.\\end{aligned}\\]]here , @xmath19 is effective interbit - coupling with @xmath20 .",
    "the effective charge energy @xmath21 is @xmath22 with @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the effective josephson energy of the squid is @xmath25 with josephson energy @xmath26 of the single junction . above ,",
    "@xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the sum of all capacitances connected to the @xmath3th box .",
    "the pesudospin operators are defined as @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "first , let us consider the circuit working at the co - resonance point ( i.e. , @xmath31 , yielding @xmath32 ) , and the applied fluxes are set as @xmath33@xmath34@xmath35@xmath34@xmath36 ( yielding @xmath15@xmath34@xmath37@xmath34@xmath38 ) . in this case",
    ", the circuit has the hamiltonian @xmath39 the corresponding time - evolution operator reads @xmath40\\hat{u}_{\\rm int}(t),\\ ] ] where the operator @xmath41 is determined by @xmath42 with @xmath43\\sigma^{(1)}_z\\sigma^{(2)}_z \\exp\\left[\\frac{it}{\\hbar}\\varepsilon_j^{(j)}\\sigma^{(j)}_x\\right].\\ ] ] considering @xmath44 ( e.g. , @xmath45 in the circuit  @xcite ) , one can make the following perturbation expansion :    @xmath46    neglecting the higher - order terms of @xmath47 , since it is small , the hamiltonian of the system can be effectively rewritten as @xmath48\\sigma _ { x}^{(j)}\\otimes\\hat{i}^{(k)}.\\ ] ] above , the first - order expansion term @xmath49 practically does not contribute to the time evolution , due to its small probability ( proportional to @xmath50 ) . under this approximation ,",
    "the fixed interaction between the qubits has been effectively eliminated , except resulting in a shift of the relatively strong josephson energy .",
    "thus , the system effectively undergoes an evolution : @xmath51,\\ \\",
    "\\varphi_j=\\frac{\\varepsilon_j^{(j)}t}{\\hbar}\\left(1 + 2\\zeta_j^{2}\\right),\\ ] ] which reduces to the single - qubit @xmath52-rotation ( i.e. , qubit - flip ) on the @xmath3th qubit , if the duration is set by @xmath53 .",
    "the robustness of this dynamical decoupling can be verified by testing the difference of the corresponding physical effects , e.g. , the transition probabilities @xmath54 between two selected states , due to the present approximate time - evolution @xmath55 and the exact one @xmath56 respectively . here , @xmath57^{1/2}\\,\\exp[-i\\xi_j(t)],\\ ] ] with @xmath58^{1/2 } , \\\\",
    "\\xi_j(t)&= & \\arctan[\\,2\\zeta_j\\nu_j^{-1}\\tan(\\varepsilon_j^{(j)}\\nu_j t /\\hbar)].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]     ( solid lines ) and @xmath59 ( dotted lines ) for the transition @xmath60 versus @xmath61 , due to the approximate and exact time evolutions , respectively .",
    "the difference between them decreases with decreasing interbit coupling @xmath62.,width=476 ]    figure 2 shows that the probabilities for the transition @xmath60 due to the evolutions @xmath63 ( solid lines ) and @xmath64 ( dotted lines ) possess the same oscillating period .",
    "also , the difference between the probabilities decreases when deceasing the coupling strength @xmath47 : the largest differences are less than @xmath65 and @xmath66 for coupling strengths @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively .",
    "similarly , if the system works far from the co - resonance point ( e.g. , @xmath69 ,  @xcite ) , then both @xmath70 and the fixed coupling @xmath71 are the small perturbative quantities , compared to the charging energy @xmath72 .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian ( 1 ) can be effectively approximated by @xmath73 with @xmath74@xmath34@xmath75 $ ] , and @xmath76@xmath34@xmath77 .",
    "the evolution corresponding to this effective hamiltonian results in a two - qubit operation @xmath78\\otimes \\ ! \\ ! \\prod_{j=1,2}\\exp [ -i\\chi_{j}\\sigma _ { z}^{(j)}],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 and @xmath80 , @xmath81 .",
    "for the simplest case where @xmath82 and thus @xmath83 , we have @xmath84 . by using a refocusing technique , like in nmr  @xcite",
    ", we can effectively realize another important single - qubit operation : @xmath85 ^ 2=\\exp [ -i\\phi_{j}\\sigma _ { z}^{(j)}],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath86 .",
    "the inverse of this operation , i.e. , the gate @xmath87 $ ] can be obtained by changing the signs of @xmath88 via controlling the applied gate voltage .",
    "the single - qubit gates @xmath89 and @xmath90 do not commute , and thus constitute a universal single - qubit gate set , which can assist the realization of two - qubit gates to implement any unitary operation on this circuit . for example , a hadamard - like operation @xmath91 can be implemented , which will take an important role for testing bell s inequality .",
    "by using the above dynamical decoupling procedure , we now show that bell s inequality may be tested with fixed - coupling josephson - qubits .",
    "first , the desired entanglement between these squid - based qubits can be created in a repeatable way .",
    "initially , the system works sufficiently far from the co - resonance point and remains at the state @xmath92 , @xmath93 .",
    "now , a pair of gate voltage pulses brings the system to the co - resonance point  @xcite and lets the system undergo the evolution @xmath94 , with @xmath95 for simplicity , here we assume that @xmath96 .",
    "we analytically derive the time - dependent degree of entanglement or _ concurrence _",
    "@xcite @xmath97 of this circuit @xmath98 with @xmath99}{\\sqrt{1+\\tilde{\\zeta}^{-2}}}-\\sin\\varrho(t),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath100 figure 3 shows this evolution , showing some plateaus near the times @xmath101 when @xmath102 . at these times , the system is in the following compact entangled state @xmath103 with @xmath104 and @xmath105/2 \\ ; , \\ ] ] these states are very adjacent to the eigenstates of @xmath106 , and almost do not evolve for several very short time intervals .",
    "thus , periodically , their degrees of entanglement are almost unchanged , shown by the short plateaus in fig .",
    "the maximally entangled states ( corresponding to the top plateaus in fig .",
    "3 ) occur when the pulse durations @xmath101 are set properly such that the condition @xmath107 is further satisfied .",
    "next , using dynamically - generated single - qubit operations , the controllable variables @xmath108 can be encoded into the generated entangled states , keeping the degree of entanglement unchanged .",
    "the change of concurrence of the two - qubit entangled state can be effectively suppressed by continuously applying controllable single - qubit operations .",
    "this is similar to the approaches for suppressing decoherence in open quantum systems by using the quantum zeno effect and the bang - bang \" decoupling method  @xcite .",
    "thus , the new entangled state @xmath109 with @xmath110/2,\\\\ a_{10}&=&[-i\\alpha \\exp ( -i\\theta _ { 1})-i\\beta \\exp ( i\\theta _ { 2})]/2,\\\\ a_{01}&=&[-i\\alpha \\exp ( -i\\theta _ { 2})-i\\beta \\exp ( i\\theta _ { 1})]/2,\\\\ a_{11}&=&[\\alpha \\exp ( -i\\theta _ { 1}-i\\theta _ { 2})-\\beta ] /2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] has the same degree of entanglement as that of the @xmath111 generated above .",
    "finally , the correlations between the classical variables @xmath108 can be measured by simultaneously detecting the populations of qubits in the excited @xmath112 or ground states @xmath113  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the above steps can be repeated many times for the same classical variables and then the correlation function @xmath114 can be measured as @xmath115 with @xmath116 ( @xmath117 ) being the number of events with two qubits found in the same ( different ) logic states .",
    "theoretically , the above projected measurements can be expressed via @xmath118 and the correlation in the outcomes can be calculated as @xmath119    for the sets of angles : @xmath120 , the clauser , horne , shimony and holt ( chsh )  @xcite function @xmath121 is larger than @xmath122 for @xmath123 therefore , properly setting the pulse duration @xmath124 to prepare the desired entangled state ( whose plateau - like concurrence is larger than @xmath125 ) , the chsh - type bell s inequality  @xcite @xmath126 can be effectively tested by experimentally measuring the chsh function : @xmath127 .     for the circuit ( fig .",
    "1 ) with couplings : @xmath128 ( dashed line),@xmath129 ( solid line ) , respectively . here , @xmath130 .",
    "the @xmath131 ( dotted line ) gives the threshold for the violation of bell s inequality for the entangled state ( 8) , whose degree of entanglement slowly changes during several short time intervals ( see the plateaus in the figure).,width=510 ]",
    "the simplest dynamical - decoupling process proposed above consists of two @xmath132-pulses and two delays @xmath133.\\ ] ] the duration of the @xmath132-pulse is calculated  @xcite as @xmath134@xmath34@xmath135@xmath34@xmath136 and @xmath137@xmath34@xmath138\\simeq 31\\,\\mathrm{ps}$ ] .",
    "consequently , the longest time delay @xmath139 between the two @xmath140-pulses could be estimated  @xcite as @xmath141 ( for @xmath142@xmath34@xmath38 ) , @xmath143 ( for @xmath142@xmath34@xmath144 ) , @xmath145 ( for @xmath142@xmath34@xmath122 ) , and @xmath146 ( for @xmath142@xmath34@xmath147 ) , etc .",
    "thus , it is easy to experimentally check this simplest proposal for eliminating the fixed interbit coupling by using the pulse sequence : @xmath148 , or @xmath149 .",
    "after these operations the two qubits should return to their initial states .",
    "furthermore , an universal two - qubit controlled-@xmath150 gate could be implemented by using the operational sequence : @xmath151 .",
    "similar to other theoretical schemes ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , the realizability of the present proposal also faces the technological challenge of rapidly on / off switching the josephson energy of the qubit by using fast magnetic pulses  @xcite .",
    "this experimental difficulty could be relaxed by increasing the durations of the applied pulses . especially , the decoherence time of the two - qubit capacitively - coupled josephson circuit  @xcite could be increased by decreasing the coupling capacitance @xmath152 . in principle , the lifetime of the generated entangled state ( 19 ) adequately allows to perform the required operations for testing bell s inequality ( 27 ) , since such a state is very adjacent to the eigenstates of the circuit s hamiltonian @xmath106 .",
    "in fact , the decay time of a two - qubit excited state is long ( up to @xmath153 ns ) , even for very strong interbit coupling ( e.g. , @xmath154 in the recent experiment  @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the influence of the environmental noise and operational imperfections is not fatal , as the nonlocal correlation @xmath155 in bell s equality is _ statistical_i.e . , its fluctuations could be effectively suppressed by averaging over several repeatable experiments .    in summary , we propose an effective dynamical - decoupling approach to overcome the fixed - interaction difficulty in superconducting nanocircuits .",
    "the dynamically - generated single - qubit operations may be used to test bell s inequality , providing another way to verify the existence of entanglement between two capacitively coupled josephson qubits .",
    "the proposed approach can be easily modified to manipulate quantum entanglement in other `` fixed - interaction '' solid - state systems , e.g. , the capacitively ( inductively ) coupled josephson phase ( flux ) circuits , and the ising ( heisenberg)-spin chain .",
