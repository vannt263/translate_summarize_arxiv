    "the thermoelectric effect is one of the most important effect that can contribute in harvesting energy by converting heat into electricity .",
    "the efficiency of a thermoelectric material is usually evaluated by the dimensionless figure of merit @xmath6 defined as below , @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the electrical conductivity , seebeck coefficient , temperature , and thermal conductivity , respectively .",
    "the thermal conductivity @xmath11 consists of electronic and lattice ( phonon ) contributions , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "good thermoelectric materials should have a combination of large power factor @xmath14 and low thermal conductivity .",
    "however , the difficulty of obtaining good thermoelectric materials is generally recognized .",
    "namely , there is generally an anti - correlation between the seebeck coefficient and the electrical conductivity , so that the power factor is maximized at a certain carrier doping level@xcite .",
    "moreover , there is a relation between the electronic thermal conductivity @xmath12 and the electrical conductivity @xmath8 , the wiedemann  franz law@xcite , which shows that the ratio between the two is a constant .",
    "this implies that it is generally difficult to have high electrical conductivity and low electronic thermal conductivity at the same time .",
    "the lattice thermal conductivity @xmath15 can almost be independent from the electronic structure , so that well known thermoelectric materials have small lattice thermal conductivity and small electronic thermal conductivity , but often moderate power factor.@xcite    theoretically , condition for obtaining high thermoelectric performance has been widely investigated .",
    "most of the previous theories that analyze this condition on a general basis have adopted a parabolic band structure .",
    "there , it has been generally recognized that the @xmath16 factor ( @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the mobility and effective mass , respectively ) , gives a measure for the dimensionless figure of merit.@xcite it has been considered that in order to increase the @xmath16 factor , a large effective mass and small lattice thermal conductivity are required , but more recently , it has been pointed out that the @xmath16 factor is actually inversely proportional to the effective mass if the effective mass dependence of the quasi - particle lifetime is taken into account@xcite . the one dimensional quantum wire and quantum - well structure can obtain large dimensionless figure of merit because of a large @xmath16 factor.@xcite also , it has theoretically been suggested for a coexistence between large seebeck coefficient and large electrical conductivity due to the multi valley effect@xcite because several bands can contribute to the electrical conductivity . from the viewpoint of optimizing the power factor",
    ", we have proposed that it is better to go beyond the parabolic band structure , and introduced the idea of the `` pudding mold type band '' , which has a flat portion at the band edge , gives rise to a coexistence of large seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity.@xcite we have shown that the shape of the band structure plays an important role for enhancing the thermoelectric performance in a number of materials.@xcite    the dimensionless figure of merit can be also described as follows , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the lorenz number in the wiedemann  franz law , @xmath22 shows the difference between the actual lorenz number and the lorenz number in the wiedemann ",
    "franz law , namely , @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the dimensionless figure of merit at @xmath25 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath22 plays a key role in eq.([eq_zet1 ] ) because the small @xmath22 enhances @xmath24 and hence @xmath6 .",
    "it suggests that the validity of the wiedemann  franz law in the low carrier concentration regime strongly controls the dimensionless figure of merit .",
    "the wiedemann ",
    "franz law should depend on the electronic band structure , so that we can assume that the coefficient @xmath26 can be controlled by the shape of the band structure as is the case with the enhancement of the power factor in the pudding mold type band .",
    "actually , the theoretical result has shown that the anomalous thermal conductivity can be understood from the band structure point of view.@xcite    given this background , we study the correlation between the thermoelectric properties and the band structure using boltzmann equation in the @xmath27 dimensional system .",
    "we adopt the electronic band dispersion @xmath0 with @xmath28 , and focus on the effect of the band shape , while the effect of the band width on thermoelectric properties is eliminated by normalizing the width .",
    "the pudding mold type band , which has large density of states at the band edge , is obtained for @xmath29 for @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and @xmath32 for @xmath33 .",
    "we find that the pudding mold type band suppress the lorenz constant compared to that of the usual parabolic band for @xmath34 due to its shape .",
    "it is because of the band shape and the difference of the energy range , which contributes to the electrical conductivity , seebeck coefficient and electronic thermal conductivity .",
    "the dimensionless figure of merit is larger in the pudding mold type band structure than that in the parabolic type band due to the large power factor and small lorenz number .",
    "we conclude that the pudding mold type band can strongly enhance not only the power factor but also the dimensionless figure of merit due to stronger violation of the wiedemann  franz law .",
    "in order to understand the band structure dependence of thermoelectric properties , we calculate the thermoelectric properties using the band structures described as follows , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the wave vector , and @xmath28 is an index that determines the band shape .",
    "@xmath37 is the normalization factor of the band width .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath37 is defined as @xmath38 at the brillouin zone edge @xmath39 , and hence the band width is the unit of the energy .",
    "we assume a simple cubic unit cell and take the lattice constant @xmath40 hereafter .    using the boltzmann equation ,",
    "the seebeck coefficient , electrical conductivity and electronic contribution to the thermal conductivity are described as follows , @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the wave vector , the quasi - particle lifetime , the @xmath44 component of the group velocity , the electronic band dispersion , fermi  dirac distribution function , and the chemical potential , respectively .",
    "the band structure in eq.([eq_band ] ) is isotropic with respect to the wave vector ( only depends on @xmath45 ) , so that we only show the @xmath46 component of the thermoelectric properties .",
    "we approximate the quasi - particle lifetime @xmath47 as a constant ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "theoretical results have shown that the lifetime constant approximation has well explained the experimental results@xcite .",
    "the seebeck coefficient does not depend on the quasi - particle lifetime within the lifetime constant approximation but the electrical and electrical thermal conductivity depends on the lifetime .",
    "when we assume @xmath49 , a sommerfeld expansion can be performed in eq.([eq_km ] ) , ( [ eq_sigma ] ) and ( [ eq_boltzmann ] ) , @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the spectral conductivity and the boltzmann constant , respectively . the lorenz number in the wiedemann ",
    "franz law is obtained from eqs.([eq_sommer_sigma ] ) and ( [ eq_sommer_kappa ] ) , @xmath53",
    ", width=264 ]    we now move on to the results and discussion . the density of states @xmath54 for the @xmath55 dimensional system , @xmath56 is shown in fig.[fig1 ] , where @xmath57 is a constant parameter that depends on the dimensionality of the system , i.e. , @xmath58 .",
    "it can be seen in fig.[fig1 ] that the density of states diverges at the edge of the band structure for @xmath29 .",
    "this is because the band structure for @xmath29 has a flat portion at the band edge ( see the inset of fig.[fig1](a ) ) .",
    "we hence call the band structure for @xmath29 the pudding mold type band .",
    "the density of states at the band edge in the one dimensional system diverges for @xmath32 due to a specific feature of the one dimensional system .",
    "the band structure in the one dimensional system also has a flat portion along the @xmath59 and @xmath60 directions .",
    "therefore , we can regard the band structure in the one dimensional system as the pudding mold type band in the wide sense of the term .     and ( c)3.[fig2],width=264 ]    the electronic contribution to the thermoelectric properties only depends on the spectral conductivity @xmath51 .",
    "thus , we now discuss the difference of the spectral conductivity among the band structures before we show the results of the seebeck effect .",
    "when we define the spectral conductivity @xmath51 as described below , @xmath61 the group velocity @xmath62 as a function of energy can be described as follows , @xmath63 the spectral conductivity shown in fig.[fig2 ] is therefore obtained from eqs.([eq_dos])-([eq_v ] ) , @xmath64 eq.([eq_sigma_e ] ) shows that the contribution of the group velocity to the spectral conductivity is larger than that of the density of states .",
    "this is because , roughly speaking , @xmath65 holds .",
    "the spectral conductivity in two and three dimensional systems ( fig.[fig2 ] ( b ) and ( c ) ) shows that the spectral conductivity of the pudding mold type band is larger than that for @xmath66 .",
    "the pudding mold type band has small group velocity at the band edge , but large velocity right above it , so combining the large density of states around the band edge along with the strong increase of the velocity with increasing energy , the pudding mold type band gives rise to a large spectral conductivity . in the case of the one dimensional system , the pudding mold type band is obtained for @xmath32 , so that all three have the same tendency of the spectral conductivity around the band edge .",
    "we now present the calculation results of the thermoelectric properties at the temperature @xmath67 throughout the paper , which corresponds to about 350k assuming the band width ( the unit of the energy ) to be 2ev .",
    "we first start with 3d . the seebeck coefficient and normalized power factor",
    "are shown in fig.[fig3](a ) and ( b ) , respectively , as functions of the chemical potential .",
    "the seebeck coefficient is barely dependent on the band shape , while the power factor is strongly enhanced for the pudding mold type bands .    , which depicts the energy range that contributes to @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) , @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) and @xmath72 @xmath73 .",
    "[ fig4],width=264 ]    in order to understand these band shape dependences , we discuss the energy range of the states that mainly contribute to the the thermoelectric properties .",
    "@xmath74 in eq.([eq_km ] ) can be described using the spectral conductivity , @xmath75 fig.[fig4 ] shows @xmath76 , which shows the energy range of the states that contribute to the electrical conductivity ( @xmath68 ) , seebeck coefficient ( @xmath68 and @xmath70 ) and electronic thermal conductivity ( mainly @xmath72 in the metallic regime ) .",
    "this figure clearly shows that the contribution to the electrical conductivity comes from around the chemical potential ( to @xmath77 ) , while the states in the energy range between @xmath78 and 4@xmath78 measured from the chemical potential contribute to @xmath70 for the seebeck coefficient .",
    "for the electronic thermal conductivity , @xmath79 mainly takes large values between @xmath80 and @xmath81 .    from the above observation",
    ", it can be seen that the main contribution to the seebeck coefficient comes from @xmath82 for @xmath68 , and @xmath83 for @xmath70 . in general",
    ", the seebeck coefficient tends to become large as the chemical potential becomes smaller and sinks below the band edge because @xmath68 decreases due to small @xmath82 while @xmath70 keeps its value because @xmath83 is still large compared to @xmath82 .",
    "now , the band shape dependence of the electrical conductivity and seebeck coefficient can also be understood within the framework of the energy dependence of @xmath51 .",
    "the spectral conductivity @xmath51 for @xmath84 is large compared to that for @xmath2 , so that the electrical conductivity for @xmath84 is larger than that for @xmath2 for the same chemical potential .",
    "on the other hand , the seebeck coefficient does not strongly depend on the band shape because not the value of @xmath51 itself but the ratio of @xmath51 between @xmath85 and @xmath86 mainly determines the seebeck coefficient .",
    "therefore , we can say that the pudding mold type band gives rise to a large power factor compared to the parabolic band , for _ a fixed chemical potential _ , because the electrical conductivity is large while the seebeck coefficient is essentially band shape independent .    ,",
    "width=226 ]    here we note the difference between fixed chemical potential and fixed carrier concentration . to see this , we show in fig.[fig3 - 2 ] , the seebeck coefficient and the normalized power factor as functions of the number of electrons per unit cell . as was shown in ref .",
    ", the power factor is optimized at a much larger carrier concentration in the pudding mold type band compared to the parabolic band . in the preceding context , this is because the amount of electrons is much larger in the former compared to the latter at a fixed chemical potential .",
    "we now turn to the electronic thermal conductivity and the wiedemann  franz law .",
    "we show in fig.[fig3](c ) the coefficient @xmath87 in eq.([eq_zet1 ] ) here again as a function of the chemical potential .",
    "@xmath22 should be unity when the wiedemann ",
    "franz law is valid .",
    "it is found that the wiedemann ",
    "franz law is valid in the large chemical potential regime ( @xmath88 ) because the electronic structure within @xmath89 measured from the chemical potential mainly contributes to @xmath74 .",
    "when the chemical potential decreases from @xmath90 , @xmath22 decreases in all of the band structures , but the reduction of the lorenz number for @xmath91 and @xmath92 is larger than that for @xmath66 . in order to understand the origin of the band shape dependence of @xmath22 , we describe @xmath93 as follows , @xmath94 when we assume @xmath95 , the second term of the right hand side in eq.([eq_wiedemann ] ) should be zero , and @xmath72 and @xmath68 can be described using the sommerfeld expansion , and we obtain @xmath96 .",
    "eq.([eq_wiedemann ] ) shows that large seebeck coefficient always suppresses @xmath22 , while @xmath22 tends to be enhanced by the large @xmath97 in the low carrier concentration regime as can be understood from a discussion similar to that of the chemical potential dependence of the seebeck coefficient .",
    "the dotted line in fig.[fig3](c ) shows the first term of the right side in eq.([eq_wiedemann ] ) and the value monotonically increases when the chemical potential decreases . as we described in the case of the seebeck coefficient , @xmath97 roughly corresponds to @xmath98 . if we compare @xmath51 between @xmath2 and @xmath92 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 , so that @xmath98 for @xmath2 is larger than that for @xmath84",
    ". therefore , the wiedemann ",
    "franz law is more strongly violated for the pudding mold type band .",
    "this is also reflected in @xmath24 shown in fig.[fig3](e ) , where adopting the actual @xmath22 values results in about 30% increase in @xmath101 in the small chemical potential regime compared to the case when we assume that the wiedemann ",
    "franz law is valid ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "since @xmath101 is the theoretically allowed maximum dimensionless figure of merit , fig.[fig3](e ) indicates that wide - band - gap materials ( where the chemical potential can be lowered sufficiently below the band edge without encountering the lower bands ) has a potential for extremely large dimensionless figure of merit , regardless of the validity of the wiedemann ",
    "franz law . also , @xmath101 calculated as functions of the chemical potential is almost independent of the band shape . these result",
    "are obtained because , in the absence of the lattice thermal conductivity , the dimensionless figure of merit in the low carrier limit is almost solely determined by the seebeck coefficient owing to @xmath103 constant in this regime . in reality ,",
    "actual materials have finite lattice thermal conductivity , so that @xmath104 is large in the low carrier concentration regime .",
    "therefore , the  ideal \" dimensionless figure of merit @xmath24 for @xmath105 never corresponds to the  actual \" dimensionless figure of merit .",
    "in fact , the actual dimensionless figure of merit @xmath6 depends on the shape of the band structure . in fig.[fig3](f ) , we show the dimensionless figure of merit @xmath6 calculated by assuming the lattice thermal conductivity @xmath15 to be the same as @xmath106 for the electron doping level of @xmath107 electrons / site for @xmath84 in the one dimensional system , which is a reasonable choice considering values of the thermal conductivity in actual materials .",
    "in contrast to the case of @xmath24 , the effect of the band shape on @xmath6 is clearly seen , where the pudding mold type band ( the case of @xmath108 ) indeed strongly enhances the thermoelectric efficiency . in order to pin down the origin of the enhancement of @xmath6 for the pudding mold type band ,",
    "we introduce @xmath109 , which is a part of @xmath6 , namely , @xmath110 @xmath111 is thus a coefficient that determines to what extent the dimensionless figure of merit deviates from its  ideal \" value with @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "the pudding mold type band , the combination of small @xmath22 and large @xmath114 result in the enhancement of the dimensionless figure of merit as compared to that in the parabolic band result . physically",
    ", the enhancement of @xmath6 in the pudding mold band should be attributed to the large conductivity @xmath8 , which is almost proportional to the electronic thermal conductivity @xmath106 in the low carrier density regime for a fixed temperature as seen in fig.[fig3](d ) . indeed , combining figs.[fig3](a ) ( the seebeck coefficient is essentially independent of the band shape for a fixed chemical potential ) and ( b ) ( large power factor for @xmath115 and @xmath108 ) shows that the pudding mold type band has large electrical conductivity when compared at the same chemical potential .",
    "therefore , the ratio @xmath114 is larger for the pudding mold type band than that for the parabolic band .",
    "note that for some range of chemical potential , @xmath116 for the pudding mold band , implying that the dimensionless figure of merit with finite @xmath15 exceeds the `` ideal '' @xmath6 value of @xmath112 and @xmath113 due to @xmath117 .",
    "we summarize that the pudding mold type band has a large power factor and large dimensionless figure of merit compared to the parabolic band .",
    "we stress that having a flat band bottom as in the pudding mold type band is different from simply increasing the mass in a parabolic band .",
    "in fact , it has recently been realized that enhancing the mass in a parabolic band actually is _ unfavorable _ for good thermoelectric properties .",
    "namely , when the electron - phonon scattering is dominant in the electron transport process , the quasi - particle lifetime @xmath47 is proportional to @xmath118.@xcite taking this effect into account , the @xmath16 factor is actually inversely proportional to the effective mass . in the pudding mold type band we considered here , the effective mass at the band bottom , namely , the inverse of the coefficient of the term proportional to @xmath119 , diverges , but this does not imply that the lifetime is 0 because the group velocity rapidly increases just above the band edge ( note that the band width is kept to be the same as that of the parabolic band , which requires a rapid increase of the band dispersion just above the band edge ) .",
    "hence , the pudding mold type band has an ideal band shape in the sense that the large group velocity just above the fermi level , combined with the large carrier concentration due to the large dos at the band edge , gives rise to excellent thermoelectric properties compared to the parabolic band .",
    ", width=264 ]    we now move onto the results of the thermoelectric properties in the one and two dimensional band structures .",
    "the spectral conductivity @xmath51 for the 2d case is proportional to the energy as far as the band dispersion is isotropic ( dependent only on @xmath45 ) as in eq.([eq_band ] ) .",
    "therefore , the seebeck coefficient ( @xmath120 ) and @xmath93 ( consisting of @xmath97 and @xmath9 ) do not depend on the band shape because these quantities are determined by ratios of @xmath51 at different energy range . on the other hand ,",
    "the power factor and the dimensionless figure of merit shown in fig.[fig5 ] indicates the importance of the band shape .",
    "it is because the absolute value of the spectral conductivity in fig.[fig2](b ) is larger for the pudding mold type band due to the large density of states and large difference of the group velocity around the edge of the band structure .",
    "therefore , the effect of the pudding mold type band does not strongly depend on the dimensionality of the band structure .",
    "if we compare the pudding mold type band between the three and two dimensional systems , the spectral conductivity @xmath51 is ( almost ) proportional to the energy in both cases .",
    "this means that the seebeck coefficient and the coefficient @xmath22 in eq.([eq_zet1 ] ) , which measures the deviation from the wiedemann ",
    "franz law , are almost independent of the dimensionality of the system , so that the dimensionless figure of merit also does not strongly depend on the dimensionality .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of the parabolic band , where 2d has much larger @xmath6 than in 3d ( compare fig.[fig3](f ) and fig.[fig5](b ) ) .",
    "the density of states of the parabolic band drastically changes from @xmath121 to constant , so that the absolute value of the spectral conductivity for 2d case is larger than that for 3d case because the number of wave vector for contributing the conduction along the same axis increases due to the reduction of the dimensionality",
    ". thus the power factor is enhanced in the low dimensional system , so that the dimensionless figure of merit increases .    ,",
    "width=264 ]    the thermoelectric properties of the one dimensional system is shown in fig.[fig6 ] .",
    "it is found that the power factor and the dimensionless figure of merit does not depend on @xmath122 because all of the band structures belong to the pudding mold type band .",
    "moreover , the dimensionless figure of merit ( calculated for finite @xmath15 ) reaches about 7 , which results from the combination of large power factor and small @xmath93 .",
    "the dimensionless figure of merit has the largest maximum value for @xmath66 because in the case of 1d , the @xmath51 is strictly proportional to the velocity @xmath62 , which has the largest values for @xmath66 in the low energy regime .",
    "we now discuss the effect of the band shape on the thermoelectric properties using more realistic tight binding models in the two dimensional case .",
    "we shall see below that the above conclusions do not qualitatively change even for realistic band structures .",
    "the band structures are described as follows , @xmath123 where @xmath124 and @xmath125 is the nearest and next nearest hopping integral in the square lattice . the next nearest hopping integral controls the band shape and we take @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "the band width is kept at unity for these choices . in the band structure of @xmath128 ,",
    "the density of states at the band edge diverges due to the van - hove singularity .",
    "similary , the one dimensional tight binding model is given as , @xmath129 where we take @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "the shape of the band structure becomes like a pudding mold for @xmath132 .",
    ", width=264 ]    , width=226 ]    fig.[fig7 ] shows the dimensionless figure of merit for the one and two dimensional tight binding models . as for the two dimensional tight binding case ,",
    "the spectral conductivity for @xmath133 in fig.[fig7](inset ) is almost the same as that for the parabolic band for the two dimensional system .",
    "the spectral conductivity for @xmath134 is larger than that for @xmath133 due to the shape of the band structure , while the energy dependence of @xmath51 itself is different from that of isotropic pudding mold type band ( eq.([eq_sigma_e ] ) given in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "this is because the band dispersion of the tight binding model strongly depends on the direction of the wave vector .",
    "nonetheless , the conclusions drawn in the former part of the paper remains completely valid .",
    "as shown in fig.[fig8 ] , despite the quite different behavior @xmath51 compared to that of the simplified band structure , @xmath135 is not strongly band shape dependent even for the tightbinding model .",
    "the dimensionless figure of merit is larger for the pudding mold type band ( @xmath134 ) than that for the parabolic band ( @xmath133 ) consistent with the discussion in secs.[3d ] and [ 2d ] . in the one dimensional case ,",
    "the spectral conductivity and the dimensionless figure of merit is almost the same for @xmath133 and @xmath136 , which is also consistent from the discussion of sec.[2d ] . in total",
    ", we can conclude that the pudding mold type band of the tight binding model can give rist to high thermoelectric performance , as in the case of isotropic band structures .",
    "in order to investigate the effect of the shape of the band structure on the thermoelectric properties , we have calculated the seebeck coefficient , electrical conductivity , electrical thermal conductivity and dimensionless figure of merit using boltzmann equation with the band structures defined as @xmath137 in the @xmath55-dimensional system ( @xmath138 ) . for @xmath2 , we obtain usual parabolic band structures while for @xmath139 , the pudding mold type band , which has a flat portion at the band edge , is obtained .",
    "the specific feature of the pudding mold type band is the divergence of the density of states and the rapid increase of the group velocity just above the band edge . due to the specific shape of the pudding mold type band ,",
    "the spectral conductivity becomes larger than that for the parabolic shape .",
    "this gives rise to large power factor and small lorenz number in the wiedemann ",
    ". the dimensionless figure of merit for the pudding mold type band is therefore enhanced due to the specific shape of the band structure . moreover",
    ", the band structure in the one dimensional system enhances the thermoelectric properties regardless of the band shape because there is always large density of states around the band edge",
    ". we can thus regard any band structure for one dimensional system as the pudding mold type band .",
    "we also calculate the seebeck coefficient within the tight binding model .",
    "we find that the thermoelectric properties in the pudding mold type band structure does not depend on the calculation models . in conclusion ,",
    "the pudding mold type band is efficient for enhancing the dimensionless figure of merit .",
    "we note that the bulk crystal structure does not always have the three dimensional band structure.@xcite for example , feas@xmath140 crystallizes in an orthorhombic marcasite structure , but the conduction band has low dimensional character due to the anisotropy of the orbitals that are the origin of the bands.@xcite therefore , by combining the orbital character with the crystal structure , we may be able to find new good thermoelectric materials that have low dimensional band structures .",

    "<S> we call this kind of band structure the  pudding mold type band \" . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath4 belong to the pudding mold type band , but since the density of states diverges even for @xmath5 in one dimensional system , this is also categorized as the pudding mold type . due to the large density of states and the rapid change of the group velocity around the band edge , the spectral conductivity of the pudding mold type band structures becomes larger than that of the usual parabolic band structures . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the pudding mold type band has a coexistence of large seebeck coefficient and large electric conductivity , and small lorenz number in the wiedemann  franz law due to the specific band shape . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the low dimensionality of the band structure can contribute to large electronic conductivity and hence a small lorenz number . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the pudding mold type band , especially in low dimensional systems , can enhance not only the power factor but also the dimensionless figure of merit due to stronger violation of the wiedemann  franz law . </S>"
