    "optical parametric oscillators ( opo s ) are well known sources of nonclassical light .",
    "type - i and type - ii opo s have been used to generate single - mode @xcite and two - mode @xcite squeezed states and to implement the einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) paradox @xcite experimentally @xcite , as proposed in @xcite .",
    "the latter has become increasingly important as continuous variables ( cv ) have been proposed and used to implement quantum information protocols @xcite such as quantum teleportation @xcite and quantum dense coding @xcite .",
    "this paper is focused on cv and opo s , but one should not forget , of course , that single - photon coincidence detection coupled with spontaneous parametric downconversion @xcite has played a major role in the violation of bell s inequalities @xcite ( practically unfeasible with cv ) , and the realization , for example , of teleportation @xcite , multipartite entanglement @xcite , and very recently quantum computer gates @xcite .    going back to cv , the generation of cv - epr states requires simultaneous squeezing of two compatible joint operators made from noncompatible local operators @xcite , or physical variables , such as number sum ( difference ) and phase difference ( sum ) ( @xmath1 ) , or amplitude - quadrature sum ( difference ) and phase - quadrature difference ( sum ) ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "reid and drummond proposed to use above- and below - threshold opo s in order to squeeze @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "in the first experimental implementation of the epr paradox @xcite , a nondegenerate opo below threshold was used .",
    "an interesting variant also demonstrated was to use two degenerate opo s below threshold , each squeezing a complementary quadrature , and to overlap their fields using a balanced beam splitter @xcite .",
    "as pointed out by lugiato et al . , the unitary transformation describing the beam splitter transforms the nondegenerate and degenerate hamiltonians into one another @xcite .",
    "several related entanglement experiments have been recently reported @xcite , and one ought also to mention the use of third - order nonlinearity in fibers to generate bright epr beams without the use of opo s @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that , despite the fact that the initial proposal for experimentally realizing the epr paradox was to use an opo above threshold @xcite , this particular implementation has not yet been carried out .",
    "rather , in all epr implementations to date @xcite , opo s have been used exclusively below threshold , as parametric amplifiers of either vacuum or bright modes .",
    "the reason for this choice is that the proposal of ref .",
    "@xcite is very challenging .",
    "it requires either a triply resonant opo with higher finesse for the pump than for the signal and idler , which presents technical difficulties , or a doubly resonant resonant opo just above threshold .",
    "moreover , in both cases , the opo must be emitting close - to - degenerate signal and idler frequencies , which is difficult to achieve because the well - known clustering effect in a doubly resonant type - ii opo puts stringent stabilization requirements on the crystal temperature , the cavity length , and the pump frequency .",
    "one has thus to address two experimental challenges , using a doubly resonant opo : to achieve stable oscillation on the frequency degenerate mode and do so close to the threshold , where the output power is the least stable .",
    "we have solved these two issues and present , in this paper , the experimental realization of a stable type - ii opo , emitting at frequency degeneracy while pumped only a few percent above threshold .",
    "note that stable twin beams have been achieved before , in particular in the record - breaking number - difference squeezing experiments by the group of fabre and giacobino @xcite and in the more recent work of several other groups @xcite , but our present work is , to the best of our knowledge , the first time that stable twin beams are obtained at precise frequency degeneracy and just above threshold .",
    "besides bright epr beam generation , such a source is also extremely interesting for the study of critical fluctuations at the transition point , including possible generation of macroscopic entanglement @xcite , and , last but not least , for heisenberg - limited interferometry ( hli ) . recall that , if @xmath5 particles are sent into an interferometer and subsequently detected or measured , the usual phase sensitivity limit is the input beam splitter s shot noise limit @xmath6 @xcite , whereas the ultimate limit is the heisenberg limit @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this is a general statement for any boson field .",
    "examples of beam splitters are a half - reflecting mirror in photon optics and a @xmath8 resonant laser pulse in atom optics .",
    "reaching the heisenberg limit requires suppressing vacuum fluctuations at the input beam splitter of the interferometer @xcite , which was experimentally demonstrated using vacuum squeezing @xcite .",
    "holland and burnett @xcite also showed that one can reach the heisenberg limit by using a source of indistinguishable twin modes , i.e.  an input density matrix of the form @xmath9 .",
    "this was demonstrated using two single - mode amplitude - squeezed beams in ref .",
    "@xcite , and also a pair of trapped ions @xcite .",
    "progress has also been made towards realizing hli with bose - einstein - condensate fock states @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note , however , that the common - mode statistics @xmath10 do not play any role in the phase sensitivity @xcite , hence generating twin fock states e.g.  @xmath11 is _ not _ necessary .",
    "therefore , an opo emitting intense frequency - degenerate twin beams is an ideal candidate system for hli , as it would bring , besides the required @xmath3 squeezing , the added benefit of a a narrow linewidth cw source , suitable to perform ultra - precise measurements such as gravitational - wave detection . note also that , since hli requires large photon numbers , it presents one fewer challenge than bright epr state generation .    in the next section ,",
    "we describe our experimental setup .",
    "we subsequently detail our experimental characterization of the source .",
    "the na : ktp crystal noncritically phase - matches type - ii degenerate parametric downconversion from 532 to 1064 nm wavelengths along the @xmath12 axis at room temperature .",
    "such a configuration practically annihilates polarization crosstalk while allowing the convenient use of highly stable nd : yag lasers .",
    "we use a @xmath13 prototype na : ktp crystal , fabricated by crystal associates .",
    "the crystal is cut along its @xmath12 axis , and ar - coated at 1064 nm and 532 nm .",
    "it is placed inside an oven made of oxygen - free , high - conductivity copper , whose temperature is controlled to less than a millidegree by way of a servo loop .",
    "we used two kinds of loop filters with equal success , one home - made and one commercial from wavelength electronics .",
    "tight temperature control of the nonlinear crystal is paramount in a type - ii opo because of the different temperature dependences of the indices of refraction for the two cross - polarized resonant signal and idler waves .",
    "the opo has a standing - wave cavity formed by two plano - concave mirrors that have a radius of curvature of 5 cm and are separated by approximately 10.2 cm , thereby realizing a concentric resonator .",
    "one of the mirrors is mounted on a piezoelectric transducer ( pzt ) .",
    "the cavity waist size is in between the boyd - ashkin confocal - focusing value @xmath14 m and the boyd - kleinman optimum @xmath15 m @xcite , which is confirmed by opo threshold measurements .",
    "the interferometer structure is built in super - invar , which confers outstanding mechanical stability along with no visible thermal expansion effects .",
    "this makes for an ultrastable optical resonator that never needs to be realigned , the opo threshold staying at its initial level for months on .",
    "the concentric geometry is more delicate to work with than a plano - concave cavity ( as used for example in hemilitic opo s ) since its spherical symmetry allows for many different cavity axes and does not constrain the alignment very strongly .",
    "this is , however , a conscious design choice as it allows us to easily find a cavity mode that coincides with the crystal s @xmath12 axis so as to completely eliminate walkoff .",
    "the opo alignment procedure consists of aligning the resonator without the crystal first , and then inserting the crystal and orienting it between crossed polarizers in order to align the @xmath12 axis with the cavity axis .",
    "the cavity is then used as a resonant frequency doubler in order to optimize the crystal temperature for maximum shg efficiency , which corresponds to the lowest opo threshold .",
    "the shg pump laser at 1064 nm ( lightwave electronics 126 - 700 - 1064 ) is , once frequency - doubled , heterodyned with the opo pump laser ( lightwave electronics 142 ) and the resulting beat note at their frequency difference is tuned to zero .",
    "the reflectivities of the opo mirrors are @xmath16 nm@xmath17 and @xmath18 nm@xmath19 for the input coupler , and @xmath16 nm@xmath20 and @xmath18 nm@xmath21 for the output coupler .",
    "the opo is therefore essentially doubly resonant for the signal and the idler .      in order to ensure single - mode oscillation within the dense cluster structure (",
    "see below ) , we use standard laser stabilization techniques @xcite , which permit cavity - length control at the femtometer level @xcite .",
    "the opo cavity is electronically stabilized by two servo loops , one for temperature and one for cavity length ( fig .",
    "[ setup ] ) .",
    "the cavity - length error signal is picked off the small leak through the hr input coupler .",
    "a sinusoidal voltage at 25 khz excites the first mechanical resonance of the pzt - mirror system and serves to modulate the opo frequency .",
    "the weak leak signal is demodulated by a lock - in amplifier , processed by a loop filter , and finally applied to the opo pzt .",
    "the good signal - to - noise ratio of this method allows us to operate with the opo a few percent above threshold , which is of interest for quantum optics with bright beams as it will allow us to easily perform homodyne squeezing measurements with a stronger local oscillator , something believed difficult @xcite because of the current power - withstanding limitations of high - efficiency photodiodes .",
    "the opo signal and idler beams are collimated by an ar - coated lens and then traverse a variable beam splitter comprised of a half - wave plate followed by a low loss polarizing beam splitter ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "we determine the reference angle of the wave plate axes @xmath23 by minimizing the beat note on the detectors , which clearly separates the twin beams .",
    "for other angles relative to this one , the beams are thus mixed in the equivalent way to a beam splitter with reflectivity @xmath24 . when @xmath25 , the setup is equivalent to a balanced beam splitter .",
    "this arrangement also allows us to check the presence of polarization crosstalk , i.e.  the existence of a residual beat note for @xmath23 . as seen in fig .",
    "[ polcrosstalk ] , this effect is negligible .",
    "the detection is performed by two high efficiency ( @xmath26 ) ingaas photodiodes ( jds uniphase etx500 t ) whose photocurrents are subtracted and sent into an ultralow - noise transimpedance preamplifier .",
    "we measure the common - mode rejection ratio to be 42 db @ 100 khz , which enables us to have a shot - noise limited detection bandwidth as low as 200 khz .",
    "figure [ sq ] displays the measured photocurrent spectrum for different cases , with a maximum measured squeezing of 4 db @ 200 khz .",
    "this detection bandwidth is quite low and unusual for squeezing experiments ( but see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . reaching even lower quantum - limited detection bandwidths ( 1 khz or less ) would be of tremendous interest for hli applied to gravitational - wave detection .",
    "the squeezing spectrum has a maximum of 4 db and an inverted lorentzian shape of width the cold cavity linewidth @xcite , which is 3 mhz here .",
    "several straightforward measures can be taken to improve on this preliminary result , such as removing the photodetectors uncoated windows , using a shorter crystal , and using ultralow - loss opo mirrors @xcite .",
    "the focus of this paper , however , is not as much on squeezing as on stability .",
    "it is well - known that , in a doubly resonant type - ii opo , the double resonance condition for the cross - polarized signal and idler inside a common cavity containing a birefringent nonlinear crystal leads to a densely clustered mode structure @xcite .",
    "this leads to a several hundred - fold increase of the constraints for length stability of the cavity , and demands that an electronic servo - lock loop be used .",
    "theoretical analyses of the type - ii opo have been carried out in refs .",
    "@xcite so we just outline the relevant points here . the double resonance condition for the signal and the idler is @xmath27 , @xmath28 being the cavity length outside the crystal , @xmath29 the crystal length , @xmath30 the refraction indices of the signal and idler waves , @xmath31 their respective wavelengths , and @xmath32 their respective mode numbers ( positive integers ) .",
    "the equivalent resonance conditions for the optical frequencies @xmath33 are @xmath34 $ ] , where @xmath35 are the free spectral ranges ( fsr ) of the signal and the idler .",
    "the resonance frequency change for a small air path change , which corresponds to actuating one of the mirrors with a pzt , is therefore @xmath36 from this equation , one finds the well - known minimum length variation @xmath37 for which a _ mode hop _ ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) occurs , in the case of a singly - resonant opo or laser . in a doubly - resonant opo , the additional constraint that both frequencies sum up to the pump frequency @xmath40 modifies the length tuning of the opo cavity in a dramatic way , as the opo will not lase for all combinations of the signal and idler modes .",
    "the result is a tightly packed cluster structure . for a stable and narrow pump frequency , which is the case here",
    ", one has @xmath41 .",
    "the length displacements corresponding to mode hops are then given by , to first order in the birefringence @xmath42 , @xmath43\\,\\frac{\\lambda_p}2,\\ ] ]    where @xmath44 is the pump wavelength , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 are integers .",
    "mode clusters are labeled by @xmath47 and separated by half a pump wavelength . inside a given cluster ,",
    "the modes are labeled by @xmath48 and separated by ( @xmath49 ) @xmath50 the signal - idler frequency difference or beat note @xmath51 differing , between two consecutive modes , by the sum of the fsr s . in the case of our experiment , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 cm , and @xmath55 nm ,",
    "give clusters every 266 nm with mode hops @xmath56 we now derive the tuning coefficients of the opo sum and difference frequencies @xmath57 with respect to the pump frequency @xmath58 , cavity length @xmath28 , crystal temperature @xmath59 , and voltage across the crystal @xmath60 ( electro - optic tuning ) .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ tune ] ) and analogs and assuming @xmath61 and no mode hops , one finds @xmath62 the next question is : what are the sources of noise ? in the experiment , the pump frequency noise is @xmath63 khz / ms with a slow thermal drift @xmath63 mhz / min ; the temperature servo gives @xmath64 mk in a 1 hz bandwidth ; and the cavity servo gives @xmath65 nm in a 3 khz bandwidth .",
    "no electro - optic servo is applied as the noise on @xmath60 is assumed negligible .",
    "the results of these stabilization efforts are displayed on fig .",
    "[ jitter ] , which shows recordings of the beat note at two very different time scales , with the temperature controlled and a free - running and locked cavity .",
    "the measured fast linewidths are of the order of 50 khz for a 30 khz resolution bandwidth , and are thus instrument - limited .",
    "the locked residual jitter linewidth is 310 khz , down from the free - running range of 2 mhz , and the jitter frequency is 100 - 500 hz .",
    "this 310 khz residual linewidth on the beat note is larger than expected from the length and temperature tuning coefficients calculated above , and is too fast for being imputed to residual temperature fluctuations .",
    "we deduce that the beat note stability is degraded by other factors .",
    "in fact , we have observed that the crystal is slightly inhomogeneous , likely due to a dopant concentration gradient . as a result , moving the crystal transversally in the beam tunes its birefringence and therefore the opo , which , therefore and unexpectedly , becomes extremely sensitive to table vibrations _ transverse _ to its axis .",
    "we have confirmed this by observing that the jitter s spectral signature matches that of the table vibration measured with accelerometers , both sharing in particular sharp resonances at 70 and 100 hz .",
    "this produces noise on @xmath66 , and eq .",
    "( [ lcoeff ] ) shows that the cavity length servo is ill - equipped to do much correction on @xmath67 because of the low tuning coefficient .",
    "as already mentioned , the temperature servo is too slow to be useful here , hence further narrowing of the beat note spectrum will require an electro - optic servo on the crystal so as to make use of the favorable tuning coefficient of eq .",
    "( [ vcoeff ] ) .",
    "note , however , that the current level of performance is already outstanding and satisfactory for epr and hli experiments , the beat note being tunable to exactly zero hertz ( within the residual jitter range ) by a simple temperature adjustment .      in order to determine how close to the threshold the opo can stably be operated , which is crucial in order to determine whether epr correlations can be observed , we have investigated the conversion efficiency given by @xcite @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the number of times above threshold ( and should be as close to 1 as possible ) and @xmath70 is a constant whose value is 2 for a standing wave cavity with a single - pass pump and up to 4 if the pump is reflected , the value of 4 corresponding to a ring resonator or to a double - pass pump with the right phase relationship with the signal and idler fields @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath70 therefore depends on the differential phase shift imparted to @xmath72 by reflection on the opo output mirror and on air dispersion .",
    "we measured the opo output power for different values of the pump power for the frequency - degenerate mode in stably locked conditions .",
    "figure [ eff ] displays a plot of @xmath73 versus @xmath74 , as well as a least - squares fit using eq .",
    "( [ conveff ] ) .",
    "since we do not know the mirror s phase shift , we leave @xmath70 as a free parameter in the fit .    the lowest point on the plot corresponds to @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77w per beam .",
    "we have in fact observed stable oscillation for @xmath5 as low as @xmath78 , i.e.  output powers of a few hundred microwatts per beam .",
    "this should indeed be in the regime where epr correlations are expected @xcite .",
    "the opo output noise on each individual beam is mainly that of the pump laser , i.e.  fairly low ( but with relaxation oscillations ) and is shot - noise limited above 1.5 mhz . as already seen on fig .",
    "[ sq ] , intensity - difference measurements are shot - noise limited above 200 khz .",
    "this speaks to the low level of classical intensity noise .",
    "figure [ jitter ] ( a ) also gives an idea of longer - term intensity fluctuations of the _ unlocked _ opo in a single - detector measurement .",
    "the theoretical threshold is 12 mw @xcite .",
    "we measured about 15 mw for the strongest cluster mode and 25.6(2 ) mw for the degenerate mode , which is not the strongest ( center ) cluster mode .",
    "this is due to a slight misalignment of the phase - matching angle of the crystal .",
    "correcting it is quite doable but is always a delicate operation as it couples to the cavity alignment .",
    "we observe that the power level of the degenerate mode remains remarkably constant over time , even with the experiment ( including the pump laser ) turned off each night , testifying to the stability of the optical alignments .",
    "it is possible to achieve even lower powers with the same threshold , but the capture range of the servo decreases as the gain linewidth and this degrades the locking performance .",
    "we are currently implementing lower - noise detection techniques aiming at increasing the signal - to - noise ratio by one order of magnitude and at expanding the capture range of the servo .",
    "one should also note that , since the error signal is mixed with a considerable amount of vacuum fluctuations ( 99.99% ) , we only use a classical signal to lock . as a consequence , our servo can not correct quantum fluctuations , be they phase difference noise or critical threshold fluctuations , which will allow us to observe them without interference from the locking electronics .",
    "we have experimentally demonstrated the stable operation of a frequency degenerate type - ii opo above threshold , with negligible polarization crosstalk , using a noncritically phase - matched sodium - doped ktp nonlinear crystal .",
    "the degenerate mode is obtained reproducibly without the need to realign the opo cavity after the initial alignment , and its intensity is controlled as low as just a few percent above threshold . the twin beams exhibit 4 db of number - difference squeezing at 200 khz , which illustrates the low classical noise of our setup . pushing this limit to even lower frequencies , below 1 khz ,",
    "is important from the perspective of applying hli to the detection of gravitational waves .",
    "all stability and squeezing performances can be significantly improved on this starting point , which is already suitable for the generation of bright epr beams and hli .",
    "we thank ken nelson for his invaluable help and advice with high - performance electronics design , harvey sugerman for building some of the electronics , richard stolzenberger for help with na : ktp , and rodger ashley and roger morris for machining our super - invar resonator structure .",
