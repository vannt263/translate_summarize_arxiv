    "quantum dots are artificial atoms or molecules , where the electron number , the scalar potential and the magnetic field are tunable and can provide favorable conditions for all kinds of fascinating effects ( for recent reviews see @xcite ) .",

    "it has been considered and quantitatively described in the simplest system , the two electron dot , using the exact analytical solutions for this system @xcite . in the present paper ,",
    "another effect , namely a jahn - teller - like distortion of the wm , is analyzed .",
    "again analytical solutions for the simplest system , where this effect can occur ( the three electron dot ) , proved useful .    from the very",
    "beginning we should be aware of the fact , that wigner localization in circular symmetric systems can not be identified using the electron density @xmath8 . because the hamiltonian commutes with the total angular momentum operator , the electron density can always be chosen circular symmetric @xcite and exhibits only a radial shell structure .",
    "non - circular solutions are an indication of degeneracy , but not of wigner localization .",
    "the fact that the electrons keep more or less fixed distances from each other due to a strong electron - electron correlation can be observed in the pair correlation function + @xmath9 + or the two - particle density matrix + @xmath10 + or in spin resolved versions thereof . for few electron dots",
    "both quantities are equivalent in exhibiting the existence of wigner molecules .",
    "( in @xcite the pair correlation function @xmath11 in conjunction with the density @xmath8 was used for describing the effect instead of the nowadays favored two - particle density matrix @xmath12 ) .",
    "a useful and illustrative notion of a wm in a circular symmetric confinement is a rotating and vibrating finite electron lattice @xcite . due to this picture",
    ", a three - electron wm in a circular environment would form a equilateral triangle . in the present paper , however , we have shown that this is only the case in the classical limit where the distances between the electrons are so large that the exponentially decaying overlap between the localized wave functions of the individual electrons do not matter , but the long range coulomb interaction is still effective .",
    "shorter distances between the electrons and consequently overlap between the localized electron wave functions _ may _ lead to a distortion . whether a distortion occurs depends on the angular momentum .",
    "this distortion of the seemingly natural equilateral symmetry is reminiscent of the jahn - teller effect , although in the present case the displaced objects are not atoms , but localized single electrons .",
    "( for a recent book on the jahn - teller effect including a lot of references see e.g. @xcite . )",
    "as shown below , the ground state of the wm for three electrons is isosceles including the equilateral as a special case .",
    "excited states can be completely non - symmetric .",
    "meanwhile there are a couple of papers @xcite which are focused on the case of three electrons",
    ". more work , which includes three electrons as a special case , can be found in recent reviews @xcite .",
    "the issue of the deformation of the wm without magnetic field has been discussed in @xcite by investigating the two - particle density matrix @xmath12 using wave functions from exact diagonalization in an oscillator eigenfunction basis .",
    "the author found that with increasing coupling parameter @xmath13 ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) there is a level crossing at @xmath16 , where the ground state switches from the @xmath17 to the @xmath18 state .",
    "he developed the following qualitative picture . in the _ quartet _ state ( ground state for large @xmath19 ) , the wm forms a equidistant triangle for all @xmath19 , whereas in the _ doublet _ state ( ground state for small @xmath19 ) the spatial distribution is less trivial . here",
    ", for infinite @xmath19 the electrons occupy the edges of an equidistant triangle . with decreasing @xmath19 the triangle",
    "is increasingly deformed into a isosceles one .",
    "this picture is a special case of the theory presented here .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to extend the considerations to finite @xmath20 and to present a simple quantitative model .",
    "first , we want to review that part of the decoupling of the three - electron hamiltonian into three pair hamiltonians @xcite , which is vital for the general understanding of the current paper .",
    "a numerical check of the validity of this decoupling procedure for the three - electron problem in a three - dimensional confinement without magnetic field can be found in @xcite . unlike in @xcite , in the present paper we did not take advantage of the fact that for certain external field strength and quantum numbers there are analytical solutions of the pair equation , but instead we solved the radial pair equation ( one - dimensional eigenvalue problem ) numerically , whenever a concrete solution is required .",
    "the basic results , however , can be understood without having concrete numerical wave functions , but using only the pauli principle .",

    "as shown in the appendices a and b , the quantitative errors introduced by this approximation are small and do not invalidate any of the qualitative conclusions of the present paper",

    "instead , the total wf ( [ wf - rspace ] ) is a product of two - electron ( pair ) functions , where each electron is involved in pairs with any of the other electrons . in @xcite",
    "it has been shown that the high field limit of our wavefunction ( wf ) for @xmath66 agrees with the laughlin wf for three electrons @xcite .",
    "now we want to discuss in an illustrative way , how the total wf ( [ wf - rspace ] ) reflects the basic property of wms , namely the strong e - e - correlation .",
    "let s consider the limit @xmath67 first .",
    "the radial part of the pair functions @xmath68 shows a peak at a certain coordinate value around the minimum of @xmath69 ( see fig.[fig - localization ] ) , which we call the pair length and which will be calculated in sect .",
    "this means that the probability density @xmath70 of pair @xmath71 is peaked in @xmath72-space whenever @xmath73 equals the pair length .",
    "considering the special cyclic structure of the total wf ( [ wf - tot ] ) we can conclude : the probability density has peaks , if the three electrons form a triangle with sides equaling the three pair length .",
    "the angular orientation of this triangle is arbitrary , and its translational location is defined by @xmath66 .",
    "this triangle is blurred by the finite width of the peak in @xmath68 .",
    "although our theory is aimed at the strong correlation limit , we want to point out that also the weak correlation limit can be described by product wave functions in the new coordinates .",
    "( this will also be demonstrated in the next section by investigating the numerical solutions of the pair equation in this limit . )",
    "the reason for the decoupling of the hamiltonian ( [ h - trans ] ) , however , is quite different .",
    "whereas in the strong correlation limit decoupling occurs because @xmath74 can be neglected versus @xmath36 , this is not the case for weak correlation . in the weak correlation limit , however , the whole e - e - interaction term can be neglected versus the kinetic energy .",
    "this leads to decoupling as well .",
    "describing non - interacting electrons by products of wf in the new coordinates rather than simply by one - electron functions is just a complicated ( but equivalent ) way of describing the same system .",
    "this ambiguity is a consequence of the fact that ( after neglecting the e - e - interaction ) our hamiltonian is invariant under any unitary transformation of the coordinates . because the pair functions are eigenfunctions of the orbital angular momentum operator in @xmath75-space with eigenvalues @xmath76 , the total orbital eigenfunctions ( [ wf - tot ] ) are eigenfunctions of the total orbital angular momentum in @xmath77-space with eigenvalues @xmath78 . because the transformation back to the @xmath79-space is unitary , ( [ wf - rspace ] ) has the same eigenvalues @xmath80 like ( [ wf - tot ] ) .",
    "moreover , through ( [ ansatz ] ) and ( [ wf - rspace ] ) , @xmath80 is linked to the parity of the total wave function .",
    "even ( odd ) @xmath80 means even ( odd ) parity , i.e. symmetry ( antisymmetry ) with respect to inversion of all coordinate vectors .",
    "the pair energies @xmath81 in our pair approach are of the same central importance for the electronic structure of the system as the one - particle energies in independent particle systems .",
    "the major qualitative difference between both approaches lies in the occupation ( pauli principle ) of the energy levels , which has been investigated in ref.@xcite .",

    "localization means that ( the radial part of ) the pair function @xmath68 , which describes the electron- electron distance , is peaked at a finite x. there are two reasons for localization : + a ) for small @xmath23 ( and small or vanishing @xmath92 ) the electrons are pushed away from each other by the ( last ) interaction term in ( [ veff ] ) . on the other hand , + b ) for large @xmath92 ( and small @xmath23 ) the modulus of the angular momentum of the ground state is large ( see fig.[fig - phase - diagram ] ) . in this case",
