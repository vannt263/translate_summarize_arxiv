    "their very existence puts a strong constraint on the origin and formation pathway of smbhs , since the time required to form such massive objects from stellar - mass seed bhs ( @xmath15 ) exceeds the then hubble time . as a solution to this conundrum ,",
    "the formation from massive seed bhs originating in the collapse of supermassive stars ( smss ; @xmath1 ) has been suggested ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "smss can be formed within primordial - gas clouds in massive haloes with virial temperature @xmath17 k , providing that h@xmath2 cooling is prohibited throughout the protostellar collapse . without this latter constraint ,",
    "the gas would rapidly cool via h@xmath2 and fragment into smaller pieces .",
    "h@xmath2 has to therefore be dissociated e.g. , via the photodissociation by far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) radiation from nearby star - forming galaxies @xcite or the collisional dissociation in the shocked gas @xcite .",

    "previous numerical studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) have implied that such a cloud collapses monolithically without efficient fragmentation .",
    "after a protostar is formed at the center , it then grows rapidly to an sms via accretion from the envelope at a rate @xmath18 .",
    "under such a high accretion rate , its growth is not hindered either by strong radiative feedback @xcite or by mass - loss due to stellar pulsations @xcite .",
    "so far , however , most studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) have utilized several simplifying assumptions in studying the fragmentation process , e.g. , turning off the h@xmath2 cooling , adopting optically - thin treatment of ly@xmath19 cooling , or using insufficient chemical networks that neglect the h@xmath2 formation .",
    "yet the efficiency of fragmentation depends strongly on the thermal evolution determined by the cooling processes and chemical reactions . as a result , it still remains unresolved whether the cloud fragments during the isothermal collapse at @xmath0 k before forming the protostar . in this _",

    "we follow the evolution until the formation of the protostar , including all relevant processes required for examining possible fragmentation during this collapse . among these ,",
    "the h@xmath2-line cooling is of primary importance due to its ability to rapidly drop the temperature via thermal instability if the gravitational collapse is delayed , a process possible due to turbulence generated during the virialization of the halo .",
    "if the thermal instability occurs , the cloud can fragment into many smaller mass clumps instead of forming a single sms .",
    "we therefore simulate the collapse to determine the likelihood of the outcome being a monolithic collapse to a single star or fragmentation into a binary or multiple member system .",

    "after protostar formation , on the other hand , materials initially located in the outer radius and thus with higher specific angular momentum begin to fall in , and the centrifugal radius increases outwards @xcite . in our simulation , however , the rotationally supported disk has not yet appeared because the centrifugal radius ( @xmath32 au ; @xcite ) is still smaller than the stellar radius @xmath10 au in this early accretion phase .",

    "[ fig : mdot ] ) , the protostar is known to develop a giant - like structure with a bloated stellar envelope and contracting central core @xcite and grows while avoiding the significant mass - loss due to the stellar pulsation @xcite . since the effective temperature of such a supergiant protostar is @xmath92 k",
