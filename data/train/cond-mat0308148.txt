    "computer simulations in condensed matter physics aim to calculate structure and dynamics from atomistic input @xcite .",
    "the theoretical basis of this approach is statistical thermodynamics .",
    "the conceptually simplest approach is the classical molecular dynamics ( md ) method @xcite : one simply solves numerically newton s equations of motion for the interacting many particle system ( atoms or molecules interacting , e.g. , with pair potentials ) .",
    "the basics of the method thus is nothing but classical mechanics , and one creates a deterministic trajectory in the phase space of the system .",
    "now the idea is to simply take time averages of the observables of interest along this trajectory , and rely on the ergodicity hypothesis of statistical mechanics , which asserts that these time averages are equivalent to ensemble averages of the appropriate microcanonical ( @xmath2 ) ensemble .",
    "of course , newton s equations of motion conserve the total energy @xmath5 , and hence the conjugate intensive thermodynamic variables such as temperature @xmath0 and pressure @xmath1 can only be inferred indirectly and exhibit fluctuations ( since the particle number @xmath3 is finite and sometimes even fairly small , such fluctuations must not be neglected and need careful consideration ) . sometimes it is advantageous to directly realize other ensembles of statistical mechanics , such as the constant volume @xmath4- constant temperature @xmath0 ( @xmath6 ) ensemble or the @xmath8 ensemble , and  as we shall see later  this is indeed feasible by introducing a coupling to appropriate `` thermostats '' or `` barostats '' .",
    "an alternative way of carrying out a md simulation at constant temperature is possible by introducing an artificial weak friction force , together with random forces whose strength are controlled by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "such techniques are very common e.g.  for the simulation of polymer melts @xcite .",
    "this method is very closely related in spirit to stochastic simulation methods such as `` brownian dynamics '' where one simulates a langevin equation ( the inertial term in the equation of motion being omitted ) .",
    "while dynamical correlations for such methods differ somewhat from strictly microcanonical md methods , for the computation of static properties from averages along the stochastic trajectory in phase space such methods can be advantageous .",
    "this statement is also true for the importance sampling monte carlo ( mc ) method @xcite . as is well known @xcite , mc sampling means that one creates a random walk - like trajectory in configuration space , controlled by transition probabilities that ensure the approach to thermal equilibrium via a detailed balance condition .",
    "many of the practical aspects of computer simulations , such as `` statistical errors '' and systematic errors due to the finite size of the simulated system or the finite `` length '' of the simulated trajectory ( or observation time , respectively ) , are shared by all these simulation methods .",
    "however , one important caveat needs to be made : it is quantum mechanics that describes the basic physics of condensed matter , and not classical mechanics .",
    "however , attempting a numerical solution of the schrdinger equation for a system of many nuclei and electrons still is premature and not at all feasible even at the fastest computers .",
    "thus , one has to resort to approximations .",
    "one very popular approach is the `` _ ab initio _",
    "md '' or `` car - parrinello - method '' @xcite , where one includes some electronic degrees of freedom into md via density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite .",
    "the huge advantage of this technique is that one no longer relies on effective interatomic potentials , which often are only phenomenologically chosen _",
    "ad hoc _ assumptions , lacking any firm quantum - chemical foundation . however , the disadvantage of this technique is that it is several orders of magnitude slower than classical md , and hence only very short time scales and very small systems are accessible .",
    "furthermore , the method is unsuitable to treat systems with van der waals like forces , such as in rare gases , where one still is better off with the simple lennard - jones potential ( perhaps amended by three - body forces ) @xcite .",
    "also , normally ionic degrees of freedom are still treated classically .",
    "alternatively , one can still use effective potentials between ions and/or neutral atoms as in classical md or mc , but rely on quantum statistical mechanics for the ionic degrees of freedom : this is achieved by path integral monte carlo ( pimc ) @xcite or path integral molecular dynamics ( pimd ) @xcite .",
    "such techniques are indeed crucial for a study of solids at low temperatures , to ensure that their thermal properties are compatible with the third law of thermodynamics . for most fluids ( of course ,",
    "quantum liquids such as @xmath9he and @xmath10he are an exception ) classical md is fine , and will henceforth be considered exclusively in this article .",
    "what information do we then desire to extract from the simulations ? when we consider systems in thermal equilibrium , the first task is to calculate static properties .",
    "e.g. , in a fluid a basic property is the static structure factor @xmath11 @xcite    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is a spatial fourier transform of density fluctuations , @xmath14 being the wavevector . in addition",
    ", one wants to calculate time - dependent correlation functions , that describe the decay of small thermal fluctuations with time .",
    "a quantity of this type that will be discussed later is the intermediate scattering function @xmath15 ,    @xmath16    if one considers systems out of thermal equilibrium , an important application of md is the study of systems exhibiting a steady state flow under shear deformation . the purpose of such nemd @xcite work can be the estimation of transport coefficients ( e.g.  the shear viscosity ) if the deformation is weak enough so that the system is still in the regime of linear response @xcite .",
    "however , also the study of nonlinear phenomena ( such as `` shear thinning '' , a decrease of the effective viscosity with increasing shear rate @xcite ) is of interest  @xcite .",
    "in addition , one can also study non - steady state transient behavior , as it occurs e.g.  after a sudden quench from one state to another , where one wishes to study the approach of the system to its new thermal equilibrium .",
    "classical examples of this problem are nucleation of fluid droplets in a supersaturated gas or the kinetics of phase separation in a binary mixture ( `` spinodal decomposition '' @xcite ) .",
    "however , often such processes are too slow , and can not really be studied by nemd , and instead one has to use simulations of coarse - grained models by non - equilibrium monte carlo ( nemc ) @xcite .",
    "now this list of simulation techniques and problems that one may simulate sounds wonderful  everything can be studied with computer simulation methods , even problems outside the standard realm of physics : the spontaneous formation of traffic jams on highways @xcite , anomalous time - dependent autocorrelation functions of heart beats of human beings suffering from heart diseases @xcite , critical fluctuations at the stock market before a crash @xcite , or shock waves that can destroy a silo used in agriculture when the grains of corn stored in it flow out at the wrong speed @xcite , etc .",
    "all these problems are in fact simulated by theoretical physicists using techniques very similar to md or mc .",
    "however , one must nevertheless always keep in mind that computer simulations  as all other techniques !  suffer from some very important technical limitations that the practitioner always must be aware of , just as an experimentalist in an inelastic scattering experiment must be aware of that the resolution of his energy and momentum transfer measurements limits his data analysis , and that in addition there are statistical errors due to limited intensity of the radiation source .",
    "the main limitation of atomistic simulations comes from the fact that one often must bridge many decades in spatial scale and even more decades in time scale to describe the phenomena of interest @xcite . as an example",
    ", we discuss here the problem of phase separation of a mixture of a polymer ( such as polybutadiene ) and its deuterated counterpart @xcite .",
    "if one carries out a quenching experiment , suddenly reducing the temperature from a high value in the one phase region to a lower value inside the miscibility gap and records the equal - time structure factor @xmath11 , eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , at different times @xmath17 after the quench , one observes the growth of a peak at a position @xmath18 @xcite . now polybutadiene is a flexible linear macromolecule , which in the molten state forms random walk - like coils that exhibit nontrivial structure from the scale of covalent c - c and c - h bonds ( i.e. , of the order of 1   ) to the coil radius ( which is of the order of @xmath19   , for the molecular weights used in the experiment ) .",
    "the collective length scale @xmath20 is of the order of 1000    already in the initial stage of phase separation , however .",
    "clearly , such a study of cooperative phenomena of a large number of chains would be prohibitively difficult , if we would try a chemically realistic , atomistically detailed description .",
    "moreover , the description of effective potentials driving this phase separation between protonated and deuterated polymers which otherwise are chemically identical is quite subtle : in the framework of classical statistical mechanics , the masses of the particles cancel out from all static averages , and hence such a mixture would be an ideal mixture , perfectly miscible , no phase separation would ever occur .",
    "the reason that phase separation is observed in the experiment @xcite is a quantum effect , the zero point vibrational motions of hydrogens and deuterons differ : the lighter hydrogens need more space and this causes an effective repulsive interaction between unlike species .",
    "an even greater problem is the disparity of time scales encountered in this example : while the time - scale of bond length and bond angle vibrations is of the order of @xmath21 s , already the time needed for a coil to renew its configuration can be estimated as @xmath22  s , 8 orders of magnitude larger than the vibration times , for the considered molecular weight @xcite and temperature of the experiment .",
    "the collective dynamics , however , is even much slower , because the thermodynamic driving forces are very weak .",
    "thus , the experiment shows @xcite that the interesting phenomena happen on the time scales from a few seconds to 1000 seconds , when a scattering peak develops at @xmath18 and first grows more or less at the same position and then shifts to smaller and smaller wavevectors as the coarsening of the structure proceeds . and",
    "while for the case of phases separation in metallic alloys the situation is better with respect to the length scale @xmath18 @xcite , @xmath23  @xmath24 , the typical time scale is still from @xmath25  s to @xmath26  s , and hence for a chemically realistic molecular dynamics simulation , with a time step @xmath27 in the range from 1 fs to 10 fs , the task is quite hopeless , one would have to simulate over a range of 10@xmath28 time steps which is many orders of magnitude more than what is feasible nowadays .",
    "such slow phenomena as spinodal decomposition in solid metallic alloys or fluid polymer mixtures can only be simulated by very simplified coarse - grained models , where chemical detail is sacrificed , and one applies non - equilibrium monte carlo ( nemc ) methods rather than md .",
    "these coarse - grained simulations nevertheless are very useful , both for solid alloys @xcite and for polymers @xcite . in the latter case , several successive chemical monomers along the chain are integrated into one `` effective bond '' .",
    "moreover , one also simulates relatively short ( unentangled ) chains , and hence one does not attempt to study chains of large molecular weight as done in the experiment @xcite .",
    "even with these simplifications , it is difficult to deal with such long wavelength phenomena : the computer simulation can never deal directly with the system in the thermodynamic limit , one always can treat only a finite system . in this case of spinodal decomposition of binary polymer mixtures @xcite a cubic box containing a few hundred or a few thousand short polymer chains is studied . to avoid surface effects at the boundaries of the simulation box ,",
    "periodic boundary conditions are used .",
    "such systems sometimes are called quasi - infinite , but this is not quite true : the finite size of the system still has notable effects , e.g.  the reciprocal space is `` quantized '' , since the only wavevectors that are compatible with the periodic boundary conditions are of the form    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the size of the box and @xmath31 are integers .    in practice",
    "one does find for this problem that the position @xmath18 where the peak grows occurs near values of @xmath32 where @xmath33 , and hence the discreteness of @xmath14space is a real practical problem . despite such problems , the simulations of collective phenomena @xcite are useful , but it is always advisable to carefully pay attention to possible artifacts caused by the finite size of the simulation box .",
    "this example of unmixing in polymer blends @xcite is not meant to imply that md simulations for polymers are not feasible at all : on the contrary , md work for polymers can be very useful and can even be compared to experiment quantitatively , but only for carefully selected problems ! this is shown in an example @xcite dealing with the relaxation of the configuration of polymer coils . while for entangled chains with a degree of polymerization of the order of @xmath26 the relaxation time @xmath34 of the coil configuration typically is at least @xmath22  s , the choice of shorter non - entangled chains such as c@xmath35 h@xmath36 brings @xmath34 down to about @xmath37 ns , if a sufficiently high temperature is chosen ( @xmath38 k in this case ) . fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows a comparison of data for the single - chain ( normalized ) coherent intermediate scattering function    @xmath39 \\rangle\\ ] ]    obtained by the neutron spin echo technique , with md simulation results of a suitable model . in eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) , @xmath40 is the scattering vector , @xmath41 is the degree of polymerization of the chain ( @xmath42 here ) , and @xmath43 is the position of the @xmath44th monomer of a chain ( @xmath45 at time @xmath46 .",
    "the average @xmath47 in the simulation is taken over all chains in the system and is also meant to represent the time average over the time @xmath46 .",
    "note that we have already made use of the fact that in thermal equilibrium a time - displaced correlation function as written on the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) depends only on the difference @xmath17 between the two times @xmath48 , @xmath46 , and not on these two times separately .",
    "it is seen from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] that there is an almost perfect agreement between the experimental data and the simulations , over two decades in time and almost a decade in the wavevector , and in this scaled plot there is no adjustable parameter whatsoever !",
    "thus , this agreement is by no means a trivial fitting exercise , but rather it is truly significant . while the original conclusion of the experimentalists was that their data prove the validity of the rouse model @xcite , one now knows , thanks to the simulation ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , that this is not quite correct .",
    "remember that the rouse model describes the polymer as a harmonic chain , which experiences friction and stochastic forces which represent the interactions with the surrounding chains .",
    "this simplistic model contains only two parameters , an effective size @xmath49 of a bead , and the friction coefficient @xmath50 .",
    "both are known from independent estimates of other quantities in the simulation ( static structure factor @xmath51 and self - diffusion constant @xmath52 of the chains , respectively ) .",
    "so again one can perform a comparison between the simulation and the theory without any adjustable parameters whatsoever ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "one sees that the rouse model works very well for small values of @xmath53 , while it fails for larger wavelengths .",
    "later experimental work did confirm the conclusion of the simulations @xcite that the rouse model is indeed not so perfect as originally claimed .",
    "this figure also shows that @xmath54 for typical values of @xmath53 really does decay to zero on the scale of 1 to 10 nanoseconds .",
    "we emphasize again that this was possible only due to carefully chosen simulation parameters : c@xmath35h@xmath36 is a relatively short chain , and @xmath38 k is a relatively high temperature . the experiment deliberately was done for such parameters to allow a meaningful comparison with a simulation .",
    "as was said above , for other parameters it could easily happen that the relaxation times for @xmath55 ( @xmath56 being the gyration radius of the chains ) is larger by a factor of @xmath26-@xmath57 than in the present case . while at large enough @xmath53 it still may be possible to study the relaxation in the `` time window '' accessible for the scattering experiment",
    ", it would not make sense to compare with a computer simulation : the latter can not reach thermal equilibrium if the rouse time ( the time needed to equilibrate the configuration of the _ whole _",
    "chain ) is so large .",
    "note that often it is thought that there is always a direct correspondence between quantities that one can study by inelastic neutron scattering and the corresponding md observations , since both methods have a `` time window '' of about 1 ns . however , in an experiment one can invest a time of days or even weeks to carefully anneal the sample and thus prepare very good equilibrium .",
    "but this is not the case in a simulation : in md work one almost always has to start from some initial state which is not yet characteristic for the desired equilibrium , and let the system relax towards equilibrium with a md run that also can last only a few nanoseconds ! therefore meaningful inelastic scattering experiments can study the relaxation of fast degrees of freedom in fluids rather close to the glass transition temperature of polymers or other glass - forming systems , since the system is in good thermal equilibrium .",
    "in contrast to this md simulations of a corresponding model can reach equilibrium only at much higher temperatures , however .",
    "these simple considerations are almost obvious but nevertheless often ignored  therefore we emphasize these points here .",
    "a related misconception is that a md simulation is the better the more chemical detail is included in the model : however , this attitude is completely wrong ! in fact , the level of detail in the simulations of paul _ et al . _",
    "@xcite normally did neither include fluctuations in the lengths of the c - c bonds along the chain backbone , nor were the hydrogen atoms explicitly included : the bond length was kept at the experimental value @xmath58   , and the ch@xmath7 groups were treated as `` united atoms '' ( also no full distinction between the ch@xmath59 groups at the chain ends and the ch@xmath7 groups in the interior was made ) . if one includes the hydrogens explicitly , the program is about a factor 10 slower , and a modest gain in accuracy of the model is more than outweighed by about 3 times larger statistical errors . note that this dramatic slowing down of the code is inevitable due to the very stiff potentials that need to be included in such an `` all atom''calculation and which necessitate then a particularly small time step ( and also the number of atoms is 3 times larger ) .",
    "the potentials actually used for the simulations shown in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] are bond angle potentials @xmath60 and torsion potentials @xmath61 of the form    @xmath62    while non - bonded monomers interact with a lennard - jones potential    @xmath63 \\quad , \\quad \\alpha , \\beta \\in \\{\\mbox{ch}_2 , \\mbox{ch}_3\\ } \\quad .\\ ] ]    the parameters @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath49 are given in @xcite . in principle , such effective potentials for classical md simulations should be deduced from quantum - chemical calculations",
    ". however , polyethylene is a much too large molecule to do that : only the bond angle and torsional potentials have a quantum chemical basis , although even on this issue there is no full consensus between different groups .",
    "of course , it is clear that the lennard - jones potential used here , \\{eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) } is completely _ ad hoc _ , and the parameters are just optimized in order to fit as many experimental data as possible . for the case of c@xmath35h@xmath36 , a box of linear dimension @xmath68    allows to include 40 chains in the simulation , and finite size effects are then negligible for the wavevectors of interest .",
    "it is clear that a treatment of longer chains would not only require larger box sizes but also much longer runs , and therefore are very difficult .",
    "we also emphasize that eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) is not a good basis to describe interactions between chemically dissimilar polymers with sufficient accuracy .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath3 particles ( atoms ) with cartesian coordinates @xmath69 , @xmath70 , in a @xmath71-dimensional space .",
    "the dynamics then is described by newton s equations of motion ,    @xmath72    @xmath73 being the mass of the @xmath74th particle , and @xmath75 the force acting on it , which we assume to be entirely due to interactions with other particles .",
    "thus , the potential @xmath76 is written as    @xmath77    where in the last step we have furthermore made the simplifying assumption that @xmath78 is pairwise additive ( this assumption , which is reasonable for simple liquids , is not really necessary , it can be generalized whenever appropriate , we only make it for the sake of simplicity of our presentation ) .",
    "thus    @xmath79    the total energy    @xmath80    is a constant of motion ,    @xmath81    md now means that newton s equations of motion are integrated numerically .",
    "a computationally efficient scheme is the so - called verlet algorithm  @xcite . to derive it ,",
    "we expand @xmath82 forward and backward in time ,    @xmath83    @xmath84    here @xmath85 is the velocity of the @xmath74th particle at time @xmath17 , and @xmath86 is the corresponding vector that appears in the third order of the taylor expansion .    for @xmath87",
    "we have already substituted newton s equation . adding both expansions , the odd terms cancel , and hence    @xmath88    subtraction of the expansions yields the velocity    @xmath89 + 0 ( ( \\delta t)^3 ) \\quad.\\ ] ]    this verlet algorithm [ 1,7,19,37,38 ] is manifestly time reversible : exchange of @xmath90 and @xmath91 yields the propagator for the time evolution going backward in time , and changes the sign of the velocity .    a peculiarity of the verlet algorithm is the fact that the updating of the velocities is one step behind : the velocities at time @xmath17 can only be calculated , see eq .",
    "( [ eq15 ] ) , after the positions at time @xmath92 have become available .",
    "the updating of positions and velocities is synchronized in the `` velocity verlet algorithm '' @xcite .",
    "using    @xmath93    together with the corresponding time - reversed equation    @xmath94    one obtains by adding these equations    @xmath95 \\ , .\\ ] ]    the propagation of the velocities hence requires that both the forces of the present and the future configurations are known .",
    "the second set of forces can be determined as soon as the coordinates at time @xmath92 have been obtained .",
    "note that both the verlet and the velocity verlet algorithms are completely equivalent : they produce identical trajectories .    at this point",
    "it is of interest to ask what is the scale for the time step . for simplicity",
    "we consider liquid argon , the `` fruit fly '' for md .",
    "the argon atoms are assumed to interact with a lennard - jones potential as considered in eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) , with parameters @xmath96   , @xmath97 k , and @xmath98 g . rescaling coordinates by writing @xmath99",

    ", we need to choose the time step @xmath27 so small that the third term on the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ eq19 ] ) is significantly smaller that the first and second term . for the lennard - jones system",
    "this usually means @xmath104 , which translates into real time units @xmath105 s for the time step .",
    "so even with a million time steps ( rescaled time @xmath106 one only reaches a real time of about 10 ns .",
    "it is also useful to go beyond this `` pedestrian approach '' to classical mechanics , discussing more formally the time evolution in phase space , combining the cartesian coordinates of all the particles @xmath107 and their momenta @xmath108 into a point in a 2@xmath109-dimensional space , @xmath110 .",
    "liouville s theorem says that the flow in phase space has the property that it is incompressible , phase space volume is conserved .",
    "one can formally write for any observable @xmath111    @xmath112    where the propagator @xmath113 is a unitary operator ,    @xmath114    @xmath115 being the liouville operator . now the verlet algorithm has the desirable feature that ( to order ( @xmath116 unitarity is preserved .",
    "this fact may to some extent explain why the verlet algorithm is such a particularly stable algorithm over very long times ( for a detailed discussion of the stability of the verlet algorithm see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "if the energy @xmath5 were rigorously conserved by the algorithm it would realize states distributed according to the microcanonical ( @xmath2 ) ensemble of statistical mechanics .",
    "of course due to integration errors the energy is not strictly conserved and hence one has to make sure that the chosen time step is small enough , as will be discussed below ",
    "let us disregard this problem for the moment and assume that the microcanonical ensemble is realized perfectly .",
    "how do we then estimate the thermodynamic variables of interest , such as temperature @xmath0 and pressure @xmath1 ?",
    "one can make use of the fact that in classical statistical mechanics the distributions of positions and velocities factorize ; one simply has a maxwell - boltzmann distribution for the velocities and thus @xmath0 can be inferred from the kinetic energy of the particles . defining a `` kinetic temperature '' @xmath117 as follows ( for @xmath118 )    @xmath119    the desired estimate of the temperature of the system",
    "is then computed as the average @xmath120 .",

    "the pressure @xmath1 can be estimated using the virial theorem .",
    "the dynamical variable whose average yields the pressure is defined as    @xmath123    such that    @xmath124    now we return to the problem that the energy is not strictly conserved by the algorithm described so far .",
    "the original recipe used in early md work was to rescale the velocities from time to time such that one corrects for the drift in the energy .",
    "alternatively , one can draw randomly velocities from time to time from a maxwell boltzmann distribution .",
    "both methods have the disadvantage that dynamic correlations are somewhat disturbed , and one realizes in this way neither a microcanonical nor a canonical ensemble . in the canonical ( @xmath6 ) ensemble , temperature is a given variable and therefore not fluctuating at all , and instead of the fluctuations of @xmath117 \\{eq .",

    "`` arrhenius plot '' means , the logarithm of the viscosity is plotted vs.  inverse temperature , since then an arrhenius law [ @xmath190 $ ] , where @xmath191 is an `` activation energy '' ] shows up as a straight line in the plot , with a slope @xmath192 .",
    "the experimental data included here @xcite is indeed compatible with such a law . however ,",
    "the extremely large values of the viscosity mean that the relaxation time of this melt is in the microsecond or even millisecond range . therefore the md results can not be obtained in the same temperature range where the experimental data were taken , but only at considerably higher temperatures , where experiments are no longer possible .",
    "nevertheless , these simulation results ( together with results for many other correlation functions @xcite that will not be shown here ) do have a great theoretical relevance , since they show that even sio@xmath7 has a regime of temperatures where the so - called mode coupling theory of the glass transition @xcite can be applied . since",
    "this regime of temperatures is inaccessible with laboratory experiments , the hypothesis was advanced that one needs several classes for glass - forming fluids with a fundamentally different dynamical behavior .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows that `` computer experiments '' can complement laboratory experiments by providing results for physical quantities in a parameter range which can not be studied in the laboratory .",
    "another interesting aspect of the data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] is that the stokes - einstein relation , linking the temperature dependence of the viscosity to that of the self - diffusion constant(s ) , does not hold .",
    "simulating real glass - forming fluids such as sio@xmath7 is difficult for various reasons : a great problem is again the choice of a suitable force field . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the so - called bks - potential @xcite was used , which has been proposed on the basis of quantum - chemical calculations .",

    "it is somewhat surprising that a clever choice of these phenomenological constants allows to describe the directional covalent bonding ( typically a si atom is in the center of a tetrahedron , with the oxygens at the corners ) , although one uses just pair potentials .",
    "nevertheless , the simulations are still technically very difficult : the long range coulomb interaction necessitates the use of the time - consuming ewald summation techniques @xcite ; the scale for the potential is in the ev energy range and varies rather rapidly with distance .",
    "therefore one needs to use a rather small md time step , namely @xmath201 fs .",
    "if one produces amorphous glassy structures by a md simulation with such a model , the most plausible procedure is the same as the one used in the glass factory .",
    "one starts at a very high temperature @xmath202 , and then one cools the system gradually down at constant pressure , so the temperature @xmath203 varies with time , e.g. @xmath204 , @xmath205 being the cooling rate . while the structures obtained in this way look qualitatively reasonable @xcite , one must be aware of the fact that the cooling rates applied in the simulation are extremely large @xmath206  k / s or even higher ) , which means that they are at least a factor @xmath207 larger than those used in the experiment .",
    "thus , one must expect that the quantitative details of the results ( including also the density of the material ) will depend on the cooling rate distinctly , and this is what actually is found @xcite .",
    "better results are obtained if one proceeds in a slightly different way , where one no longer tries to predict the density of the model system from the simulation , but rather fixes it to the experimental value .",
    "the system then is carefully equilibrated at a `` moderately high '' temperature before one cools it down to the desired temperature .",
    "`` moderately high '' for pure sio@xmath7 means @xmath208 k  then equilibration requires a run which is already 20 ns long . to avoid finite size effects",
    ", a box of around 48    linear dimension needs to be taken , containing about 8000 atoms .",
    "this calculation requires substantial cpu resources ( it was done @xcite at a cray - t3e parallel supercomputer , performing force parallelization ) so it is presently not easy to do much better .    in any case , with this procedure one does obtain the static structure factor of silica glass at room temperature in very good agreement with experiment .",
    "this can be inferred , e.g , from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] where we show the static structure factor as measured in a neutron - scattering experiment and which is the weighted sum of the three partial static structure factors  @xcite .",
    "since there are no adjustable parameters whatsoever involved in this comparison , this agreement is significant .    fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows now an arrhenius plot for the self - diffusion constants , using scales such that the experimental data @xcite can be included together with the simulation results . from this graph",
    "it becomes obvious that in principle one would like that the simulation spans over 16 decades in dynamics , a task clearly impossible for md .",
    "so there is again a gap between the range where simulations in thermal equilibrium are possible and the temperature range where the experimental data can be taken .",
    "but it is gratifying that the simulation can predict the activation energies for the self - diffusion constants almost correctly .",
    "now the real strength of the md simulations is that one can record in a single calculation a great variety of different static and dynamic properties simultaneously . for instances , one can study the time dependence of autocorrelation functions of the generalized temperature fluctuation @xmath209 , which is the fourier transform of the local `` temperature '' @xmath210 ,    @xmath211    one sees ( fig .",

    "thus , a current of energy , i.e.  heat , is created , the coefficient between the temperature gradient and the energy current density being the thermal conductivity @xmath182 , yielding fourier s law of heat conduction ,    @xmath231 .\\ ] ]    now in reality the situation is not so simple , since energy density and particle number density are coupled variables .",
    "each gradient therefore produces also a current of the other variable .",
    "so we have to generalize the set of flow equations eq .",

    "( [ eq55 ] ) ,  ( [ eq56 ] ) to systems containing several different species of particles then is obvious ) .",
    "also , we have written the set of constitutive equations entirely in terms of gradients of intensive variables , rather than using the density of an extensive variable as in eq .",
    "( [ eq31 ] ) . of course , using thermodynamics , the corresponding relation is easily established , since with eq .",
    "( [ eq31 ] ) on obtains :    @xmath236    in nemd simulations one usually sets up a stationary gradient by suitable boundary conditions creating a stationary current through the system . in the case of a flow of particles , this clearly is compatible with periodic boundary conditions : particles leaving the simulation box at the right simultaneously reenter at the left . for instance , we may confine a fluid between two parallel plates and let a constant force act on the particles @xcite but schemes where one avoids external walls altogether also are possible @xcite . in the latter case , one can obtain a homogeneous flow , while in the former case the velocity profile is inhomogeneous , and also the structure of the fluid close to the external walls is modified .",
    "now an important aspect of all such stationary flows is that entropy is produced : the entropy production per unit time is    @xmath237 ^ 2 +   ( \\lambda_{qi } + \\lambda_{iq } )   \\left [ \\left ( \\nabla \\frac{1}{k_bt } \\right ) \\left ( \\frac{\\nabla \\mu_i}{k_bt } \\right ) \\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ + \\lambda_{ii } \\left [ \\frac{\\nabla \\mu_i}{k_bt } \\right]^2 \\quad .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    although this entropy production per unit time is small for small gradients , nevertheless the heat that is produced makes a strictly microcanonical simulation impossible : the system would heat up steadily .",
    "thus one always has to use a thermostat .    as an example for such applications of nemd",
    ", we now briefly review some results @xcite obtained for a bead - spring model of short polymer chains confined between two parallel plates .",
