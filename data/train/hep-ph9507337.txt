    "basically , there are two competing explanations of the experimentally observed power - law behaviour of elastic hadronic form factors : hard scattering @xcite and the feynman mechanism @xcite . at sufficiently large momentum transfer ,",
    "the feynman mechanism contribution is dominated by configurations in which one of the quarks carries almost all the momentum of the hadron . in qcd , this results in an extra @xmath5 suppression compared to the hard scattering term generated by the valence configurations with small transverse sizes and finite light - cone fractions of the total hadron momentum carried by each valence quark .",
    "the hard term , which eventually dominates , can be written in a factorized form @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , as a product of the perturbatively calculable hard scattering amplitude and two distribution amplitudes accumulating the necessary nonperturbative information . however , this mechanism involves exchange of virtual gluons , each exchange bringing in a suppression factor @xmath6 .",
    "hence , to describe existing data by the hard contribution alone , one should intentionally increase the magnitude of the hard scattering term by using distribution amplitudes with a peculiar `` humped '' profile @xcite . in this case",
    ", passive quarks carry a small fraction of the hadron momentum and , as pointed out in ref.@xcite , the `` hard '' scattering subprocess , even at rather large momentum transfers @xmath7 , is dominated , in fact , by very small gluon virtualities .",
    "this means that the hard scattering scenario heavily relies on the assumption that the asymptotic pqcd expressions are accurate even for momenta smaller than @xmath8 , @xmath9 in the region strongly affected by finite - size effects , nonperturbative qcd vacuum fluctuations @xmath10 including these effects shifts the hard contributions significantly below the data level even if one uses the humpy distribution amplitudes and other _ ad hoc _ modifications intended to increase the hard term ( see , @xmath11 @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , as argued in ref.@xcite , the derivation of the humpy distribution amplitudes in @xcite implies a rather singular picture ( infinite correlation length ) of the qcd vacuum fluctuations . under realistic assumptions , it is impossible to get distribution amplitudes strongly differing from the smooth `` asymptotic '' forms .",
    "the latter are known to produce hard contributions which are too small to describe the data on elastic form factors .",
    "thus , there is an increasing evidence in favour of the alternative scenario , @xmath12 that for experimentally accessible momentum transfers the form factors are still dominated by the purely soft contribution corresponding to the feynman mechanism .    in the language of the light - cone formalism @xcite , the soft term is given by the overlap of the soft parts of the hadronic wave functions ,",
    "@xmath9 is an essentially nonperturbative object . among the existing approaches to the nonperturbative effects in qcd , that which is closest to pqcd is the qcd sum rule method @xcite .",
    "qcd sum rules were originally used to calculate the soft contribution for the pion form factor in the region of moderately large @xcite,@xcite and then small momentum transfers @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that , in the whole region @xmath13[0ex]{$\\sim$}}$}}3 \\ , gev^2 $ ] , the results are very close to the experimental data : the feynman mechanism alone is sufficient to explain the observed behaviour of the pion form factor . for higher @xmath2 , the direct qcd sum rule method fails due to increasing contributions from higher condensates .",
    "however , a model summation of the higher terms into nonlocal condensates @xcite indicates that the soft term dominates up to @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "this conclusion is also supported by a recent calculation within the framework of the light - cone sum rules @xcite .",
    "an important observation made in ref.@xcite is that the results of the elaborate qcd sum rule analysis are rather accurately reproduced by a simple local quark - hadron duality prescription .",
    "the latter states that one can get an estimate for a hadronic form factor by considering transitions between the free - quark states produced by a local current having the proper quantum numbers , with subsequent averaging of the invariant mass of the quark states over the appropriate duality interval @xmath15 .",
    "the duality interval has a specific value for each hadron , @xmath11 @xmath16 for the pion and @xmath17 for the nucleon .",
    "the local duality ansatz , equivalent to fixing the form of a soft wave function , was used to estimate the soft contribution in the case of the proton magnetic form factor @xcite .",
    "the results agree with available data @xcite , @xcite over a wide region , @xmath18[0ex]{$\\sim$}}$}}q^2 \\ , { \\raisebox{-.2ex}{$\\stackrel{\\textstyle < } { \\raisebox{-.6ex}[0ex][0ex]{$\\sim$}}$}}\\ ,   20\\ , gev^2 $ ] .",
    "furthermore , the calculation of ref.@xcite correctly reproduces ( without any adjustable parameter ) , the observed magnitude of the helicity - nonconservation effects @xmath19 with @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to understand the origin of such a large scale within the hard scattering scenario , since possible sources of helicity nonconservation in pqcd include only small scales like quark masses , intrinsic transverse momenta @xmath10 , and one would rather expect that @xmath21 .",
    "thus , the study of spin - related properties provides a promising way for an unambiguous discrimination between soft and hard scenarios .    of a particular interest",
    "there is the @xmath0 transition .",
    "a special attention to this process was raised by the results @xcite of the analysis of inclusive slac data which indicated that the relevant form factor drops faster than predicted by the quark counting rules .",
    "the relevant hard scattering contribution was originally considered in ref.@xcite , where it was observed that the hard scattering amplitude in this case has an extra suppression due to cancellation between symmetric and antisymmetric parts of the nucleon distribution amplitude , and it was conjectured that the faster fall - off found in @xcite can be explained by the dominance of some non - asymptotic contribution .",
    "later , it was claimed @xcite that , by appropriately choosing the distribution amplitudes , one can get a leading - twist hard term comparable in magnitude with the data . furthermore , the results of a recent reanalysis @xcite of the inclusive slac data are rather consistent with the @xmath22 behaviour , and this revived the hope that the @xmath0 form factor can be still described by pqcd .    however , the important result of the pqcd calculation @xcite is that the lowest - twist hard contribution has the property @xmath23 .",

    "we use the local quark - hadron duality to estimate the soft contribution for the @xmath25 and @xmath26 form factors of the @xmath0 transition to study whether the soft contribution is large enough to describe the data and whether the relative smallness of the electric form factor persists in the region of moderately large momentum transfers @xmath27[0ex]{$\\sim$}}$}}q^2 { \\raisebox{-.2ex}{$\\stackrel{\\textstyle < } { \\raisebox{-.6ex}[0ex][0ex]{$\\sim$}}$}}\\ , 15 \\ , gev^2 $ ] .",

    "note that , for large @xmath2 , our @xmath26 and @xmath55 of eq.(6.2 ) of ref.@xcite have the same power behaviour .",
    "multiplying all the factors in eq.([5 ] ) explicitly , one ends up with a rather long sum of different structures @xmath58 accompanied by the relevant invariant amplitudes @xmath59 , each of which is a combination of the three independent transition form factors listed above . to incorporate the local quark - hadron duality",

    "the perturbative contributions to the amplitudes @xmath63 can also be written in the form of eq.([11 ] ) .",
    "evidently , the physical perturbative spectral densities @xmath64 differ from their perturbative analogues , the difference being most pronounced in the resonance region , @xmath9 for small @xmath65 and @xmath66 values . in particular , @xmath64 contains the double @xmath67-function term corresponding to the @xmath0 transition : @xmath68 while the perturbative spectral densities @xmath69 are smooth functions of @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the local quark - hadron duality assumes , however , that the two spectral densities are in fact dual to each other : @xmath70 @xmath9 they give the same result when integrated over the appropriate duality intervals @xmath71 . the latter characterize the effective thresholds for higher states with the nucleon or , respectively , @xmath33-isobar quantum numbers . as noted in ref.@xcite ,",

    "now , choosing a particular lorentz structure @xmath58 , one can get the local duality estimate for the relevant combination of the form factors .",
