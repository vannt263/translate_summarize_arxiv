    "extended gauge symmetries and the associated heavy neutral gauge bosons , @xmath0 , are a feature of many extensions of the standard model such as grand unified theories , left - right symmetric models , and superstring theories .",
    "if a @xmath0 were discovered it would have important implications for what lies beyond the standard model .",
    "it is therefore a useful excercise to study and compare the discovery reach for extra gauge bosons at the various facilities that will operate during the next decade ( tevatron and lep200 ) and future facilites that are being planned or are under consideration for the period beyond ( various tevatron upgrades , lhc , the nlc @xmath1 collider , and lsgna , a 60  tev @xmath6 collider @xcite ) .",
    "such a comparison was made in earlier papers@xcite but since those papers were published many new facilities have been proposed making it a useful excercise to update those analysis . in this brief report",
    "we examine and compare the discovery limits for extra neutral gauge bosons at high energy @xmath1 , and hadron colliders that are being built or have been proposed .",
    "the collider parameters are listed in fig .",
    "1 . the goal is to compare the relative strengths and weaknesses of these facilities .",
    "quite a few models predicting extra gauge bosons exist in the literature . we will present discovery limits for several of these models which , although far from exhaustive , we feel form a representative set for the purposes of comparison . for the benefit of the reader",
    "we briefly describe the models we have chosen to study .",
    "\\(i ) effective rank-5 models @xcite originating from @xmath10 grand unified theories are conveniently labelled in terms of the decay chain @xmath11 .",
    "thus , the @xmath0 charges are given by linear combinations of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 charges resulting in the @xmath0-fermion couplings : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a free parameter which lies in the range @xmath16 , @xmath17 ( here we assume the equality ) , @xmath18 , and @xmath19/2\\sqrt{6 } \\ ; ( [ -1 , 3 , -5]/2\\sqrt{10})$ ] for @xmath20 $ ] , the left - handed fermions in the * 10 * , @xmath21 , and * 1 * of @xmath22 contained in the usual * 16 * of @xmath23 .",
    "specific models of interest are model @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) corresponding to the extra @xmath0 of @xmath23 , model @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) corresponding to the extra @xmath0 of @xmath10 , and model @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) corresponding to the extra @xmath0 arising in some superstring theories .",
    "\\(ii ) the left - right symmetric model ( lrm ) extends the standard model gauge group to @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-fermion coupling is given by @xmath31\\ ] ] with @xmath32 @xcite , @xmath33 the isospin assignments of the fermions under @xmath34 , @xmath35 the fermion electric charge and @xmath36 .",
    "we assume @xmath37 in our analysis which corresponds to strict left - right symmetry .",
    "note that the @xmath38 assignments are the same as in the standard model while the values of @xmath39 for @xmath40 and are zero for left - handed doublets .",
    "\\(iii ) the alternative left - right symmetric model ( alrm ) @xcite originates from @xmath10 gut s and is also based on the electroweak gauge group @xmath30 . here",
    "the assignments for @xmath33 differ from that of the usual lrm for @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 with @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "the lrm and alrm have idential @xmath47-quark , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 couplings .",
    "\\(iv ) the `` sequential '' standard model ( ssm ) consists of a @xmath0 which is just a heavy version of the sm @xmath50 boson with identical couplings .",
    "although it is not a realistic model it is often used as a benchmark and for purposes of comparison .",
    "\\(iv ) the harvard model ( harv ) @xcite is based on the gauge group @xmath51 , i.e. , left - handed leptons ( quarks ) transform as doublets under @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) and singlets under @xmath53 ( @xmath52 ) , and right - handed fields are singlets under both groups .",
    "the @xmath0-fermion coupling takes the form @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the third component of @xmath56-isospin , @xmath18 , and @xmath57 is a mixing parameter which lies in the range @xmath58 .",
    "we take @xmath59 in our calculations .",
    "the @xmath0 is purely left handed in this model .",
    "there are numerous other models predicting @xmath0 s in the literature @xcite but the subset described above have properties reasonably representative of the broad class of models , at least for the purposes of comparing discovery limits of high energy colliders .",
    "before proceeding to future colliders it is useful to list existing bounds as a benchmark against which to measure future experiments",
    ". constraints can be placed on the existence of @xmath0 s either indirectly from fits to high precision electroweak data@xcite or from direct searches at operating collider facilities@xcite .",
    "there have been a number of fits to precision data @xcite .",
    "we list results from the particle data group @xcite in table i. these results contain no assumptions on the higgs sector .",
    "the highest mass limits come from direct searches by the cdf experiment at the tevatron@xcite .",
    "the cdf limits are obtained by looking for high invariant mass lepton pairs that would result from a @xmath0 being produced via the drell - yan mechanism @xcite and subsequently decay to lepton pairs , @xmath60 .",
    "the most recent cdf 95 % confidence level results based on @xmath61 are listed in table i.",
    "bounds on extra gauge bosons attainable from low energy neutral current precision measurements , measurements at the tristan , lep , and slc @xmath1 colliders , as well as at the hera @xmath62 collider have been surpassed by direct limits obtained at the tevatron @xmath63 collider or will be from future tevatron upgrades .",
    "thus , we will restrict our results to lep200 , proposed tevatron upgrades , the lhc and lsgna @xmath6 colliders and the nlc high luminosity @xmath1 colliders .",
    "the signal for a @xmath0 at a hadron collider consists of drell - yan production of lepton pairs @xcite with high invariant mass via @xmath64 .",
    "the expressions for this process are given in ref .",
    "we obtain the discovery limits for this process based on 10 events in the @xmath65 channels using the ehlq structure functions @xcite , taking @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and including a 1-loop @xmath68-factor in the @xmath0 production .",
    "we include a @xmath69-quark of mass 174  gev in the @xmath0 decay width , and 2-loop qcd radiative corrections and 1-loop qed radiative corrections in calculating the @xmath0 width .",
    "using different quark distribution functions results in a roughly 10% variation in the @xmath0 cross sections@xcite with the subsequent change in discovery limits .",
    "we note that including realistic detector efficiencies would lower these limits .    in our calculations we assumed that the @xmath0 only decays into the three conventional fermion families .",
    "if other decay channels were possible , such as to exotic fermions filling out larger fermion representations or supersymmetric partners , the @xmath0 width would be larger , lowering the discovery limits .",
    "on the other hand , if decays to exotic fermions were kinematically allowed , the discovery of exotic fermions would be an important discovery in itself .",
    "in addition , the @xmath70 mixing is tightly constrained by electro - weak precision measurements so we set it to zero without affecting our conclusions .",
    "the discovery limits for various models at the colliders under discussion are summarized in fig .",
    "an important conclusion for these discovery limits is that these bounds are relatively insensitive to specific models .",
    "in addition , since they are based on a distinct signal with little background they are relatively robust limits . for the case of the di - tevatron ( @xmath71  tev ) ,",
    "the @xmath63 option has a 50% higher discovery reach than the @xmath6 option for a given luminosity indicating that valence quark contributions to the drell - yan production process are still important at these energies .      at @xmath1 colliders discovery limits",
    "are indirect , being inferred from deviations from the standard model predictions due to interference between the @xmath0 propagator and the @xmath72 and @xmath50 propagators @xcite .",
    "this is similar to pep / petra seeing the standard model @xmath50 as deviations from the predictions of qed .",
    "the basic process is @xmath73 where @xmath74 could be leptons @xmath75 or quarks @xmath76 . from the basic reactions a number of observables can be used to search for the effects of @xmath0 s : the leptonic cross section , @xmath77 , the ratio of the hadronic to the qed point cross section , @xmath78 , the leptonic forward - backward asymmetry , @xmath79 , the leptonic longitudinal asymmetry , @xmath80 , the hadronic longitudinal asymmetry , @xmath81 , the forward - backward asymmetry for specific quark or lepton flavours , @xmath82 , the @xmath83 polarization asymmetry , @xmath84 , and the polarized forward - backward asymmetry for specific fermion flavours , @xmath85 .",
    "the indices @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89`sum over all hadrons ' indicate the final state fermions . the expressions for these observables are given in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for indirect limits , a 99% c.l",
    ". corresponds to a @xmath90 effect of one observable .",
    "since @xmath90 deviations are not uncommon one must be cautious about how one obtains discovery limits for @xmath0 s .",
    "one possibility for obtaining believable limits is to raise the deviation required to indicate the existence of a @xmath0 .",
    "a second possibility is to combine several observables to obtain a @xmath91 figure of merit .",
    "we follow the second approach here by including @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath81 to obtain the 99% confidence limits in fig . 1",
    ". only contributes significantly to the limit on @xmath95 at lep200 so that our results are not in general sensitive to the inclusion of this observable in the @xmath91 at lep200 . ]",
    "one sees that the discovery limits obtained at @xmath1 colliders are as large or larger than those that can be obtained at hadron colliders",
    ". however , the bounds obtained are more model dependent than the bounds obtained at hadron colliders .",
    "for example , for model @xmath26 , @xmath96 so that either @xmath97 or @xmath98 . for @xmath99",
    "sufficiently far away from the @xmath50 pole deviations are dominated by @xmath100 and @xmath101 interference which is proportional to @xmath102 . since for the photon @xmath103 ,",
    "when @xmath97 is also equal to 0 deviations from the standard model become small .    because the bounds obtained at @xmath1 colliders are indirect , based on deviations from the standard model in precision measurements , they are sensitive to the experimental errors , both statistical and systematic . for example ,",
    "reducing the lep200 integrated luminosity from 500  pb@xmath104 to 250  pb@xmath104 reduces the discovery limits by about 15% and reducing the nlc integrated luminosity from 50  fb@xmath104 to 10  fb@xmath104 ( 200  fb@xmath104 to 50  fb@xmath104 ) for the 500  gev ( 1  tev ) case reduces the discovery limit by about 33% . including a 5% systematic error in cross section measurements and a 2% systematic errors in asymmetries where systematic errors partially cancel @xcite can lower the discovery limits significantly .",
    "the most extreme change is for the sequential standard model @xmath0 which decreases by a factor of 2 at lep200 and a factor of 3 at the nlc .",
    "clearly , systematic errors will have to be kept under control for high precision measurements .",
    "finally , we note that we did not include radiative corrections in our results . in general",
    "this is an acceptable procedure since we are looking for small deviations from the standard model predictions and radiative corrections to @xmath0 contributions will be a small correction to a small effect .",
    "however , qed bremsstrahlung corrections , in particular , initial state radiation , can give large contributions to the observables , altering the statistics we assumed .",
    "since these are dependent on details of the detector we have left them out but note that they can alter the numerical values we show in fig . 1 .",
    "among the facilities operating in the up - coming decade the tevatron continues to raise the limits on new heavy gauge bosons with limits up to the 700 - 900 gev range for @xmath105 .",
    "depending on the luminosity , lep200 can achieve comparable limits for some of the models and could even surpass the tevatron limits for the ssm and harv models if the systematic errors can be kept under control .    in the longer term , hadron colliders such as tevatron upgrades and the lhc as well as the nlc high luminosity @xmath1 collider , would significantly improve limits on the heavy gauge boson masses . for typical models such limits",
    "are in the 1 - 2 tev region for the tevatron upgrades , in the 4 - 5 tev region for the lhc and roughly @xmath106 for the nlc with 50  fb@xmath104 .",
    "the 60  tev @xmath6 lsgna collider could achieve discovery limits up to 15  tev or so while a 2  tev could achieve limits ranging from 3  tev for @xmath107 to 20  tev for @xmath108 .",
    "the limits obtained by hadron colliders are much less model dependent than those obtained by @xmath1 colliders .",
    "the lhc and a high luminosity 500 gev @xmath1 collider have discovery limits for a @xmath0 which are comparable .",
    "however , limits obtained from the lhc are robust , in the sense that they are obtained from a direct measurement with little background . on the other hand , the limits obtained for the nlc are indirect , based on statistical deviations from the standard model and are thus more sensitive to having the systematic errors under control .",
