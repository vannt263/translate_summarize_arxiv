    "it is not well understood whether and how the chromosphere ( temperature rise phenomenon in the upper atmosphere ) , which is confirmed in the sun and nearby solar - type stars , exists in old metal - poor stars .",
    "a useful guideline for considering this problem is the positive correlation between the chromospheric emission and surface rotation among cool ( young to solar age ) stars ( noyes et al .",
    "1984 ) , which can be rephrased as the activity  age relation ( skumanich law ) , since rotation is generally decelerated with age as a result of magnetic braking ( i.e. , loss of angular momentum caused by stellar wind pulling out magnetic field lines ) .",
    "this observational fact is generally interpreted by the scenario that globally - organized magnetic field generated by differential rotation - induced dynamo is essentially responsible for the origin of the chromospheric activity .",
    "then , we may expect that any chromospheric activity would have almost come to rest in such aged stars , as they are likely to be rotating very slowly ( i.e. , practically non - rotating ) due to the long - lasting gradual deceleration they have suffered .",
    "meanwhile , contrary to this naive expectation , there are indications that chromospheres _ do _ exist even in very old population  ii stars .",
    "for example , dupree , smith , and strader ( 2009 ) recently showed , in their extensive studies on the infrared he  i line at 10830  @xmath0 ( hereinafter often abbreviated as `` he  i 10830 '' ) for 41 metal - deficient g ",
    "k giants , that this high - excitation line arising from the metastable level ( 2s@xmath3 , @xmath4 = 19.72  ev ) is ubiquitously observed with appreciable blue shift for stars with @xmath5  k , indicating the existence of outward - moving high - temperature chromospheric layer .",
    "actually , detections of chromospheric emission in the core of mg  ii @xmath6 doublet at 2800  @xmath0 were also reported for 10 population  ii giants by dupree , hartmann , and smith ( 1990 ) .    yet , it is not clear from this fact alone whether the chromospheric heating mechanism similar to the solar case is operative in these evolved red giants , since some other physical process specific to the unstable low - density atmosphere may be responsible for this activity ( for example , pulsation - induced shock dissipation ; e.g. , smith & dupree 1988 ) . therefore , in order to see how the solar - type chromospheres go through changes towards metal - poor regime , one should study the activity of unevolved population  ii `` dwarfs . ''    as to activities of metal - poor dwarfs , we know only a few researches .",
    "smith and churchill ( 1998 ) investigated the cores of ca  ii h+k lines in 23 metal - poor dwarfs , and found signs of chromospheric emission in some halo stars with metallicities as low as [ fe / h ]  @xmath7 , while negative results were also obtained for not a few cases .",
    "peterson and schrijver ( 1997 ) detected chromospheric emissions of mg  ii @xmath6 2800 lines ( being superior to ca  ii h+k lines for detecting chromospheric core emissions , because of the difference in the line- as well as continuum - opacities ) in all ( @xmath8 ) metal - poor solar - type stars down to [ fe / h ]  @xmath9 they searched , which indicates that chromospheres ubiquitously exist in population  ii halo dwarfs .",
    "peterson and schrijver ( 2001 ) further confirmed the existence of lyman  @xmath10 emission in their sample of halo stars ( though the contamination of interstellar absorption and geocoronal emission made any detailed line - profile study rather difficult ) , which substantiates their conclusion .",
    "though these studies invoking the emission in the core of strong metal - lines ( ca  ii h+k or mg  ii @xmath6 ) are regarded as important , since the existence of chromospheres in old population  ii dwarfs has been revealed in the qualitative sense , they are not necessarily informative when it comes to quantitatively studying whether or not the degree of activity varies with the metallicity , since the extent of core emission in such metallic lines would depend on the metallicity even if the extent of activity remains unchanged ; also , its usability is not clear for extremely metal - poor regime ( e.g. , [ fe / h ]  @xmath11 ) .    from this viewpoint ,",
    "the most desirable way to investigate the chromospheric activity of metal - poor solar - type stars is to use the he  i 10830 line , since it is a chromospheric indicator practically independent of the metallicity .",
    "admittedly , several extensive studies on the he  i 10830 line for solar - type stars have been published so far ( e.g , vaughan & zirin 1968 ; zirin 1982 ; zarro & zirin 1986 ; obrien & lambert 1986 ; lambert 1987 ; see also the references cited in andretta & giampapa 1995 ) .",
    "somewhat unexpectedly , however , any observation of the he  i 10830 line seems to have never been reported for `` metal - poor dwarfs of population  ii '' to our knowledge .",
    "timely , we have recently obtained near - ir ( @xmath12-band ) spectra of 33 disk / halo stars ( mainly dwarfs and partly giants ) covering a wide metallicity range ( @xmath13  [ fe / h ]  @xmath14 ) , and carried out sulfur abundance determinations based on the s  i triplet lines at 1045510459  @xmath0 ( takeda & takada - hidai 2011 ; hereinafter referred to as paper i ) .",
    "therefore , we decided to examine the he  i 10830 line in the spectra of these stars with an aim to see how the chromospheric activity behaves itself in metal - poor stars , while checking if this line is visible and how its strength varies from star to star with a change of metallicity .",
    "this is the purpose of this investigation .",
    "the list of the program stars , 33 halo / disk stars ( 24 dwarfs and 9 giants and @xmath15 ) , which we tentatively call `` giants '' and `` dwarfs , '' respectively .",
    "it should thus be kept in mind that `` dwarfs '' includes some stars actually classified as subgiants . besides , in this paper , giants with @xmath16 are particularly called as `` low - gravity giants '' ( cf . table 1 ) , since they tend to show anomalous he  i 10830 line profiles . ] ) in the metallicity range of @xmath13  [ fe / h ]  @xmath14 ,",
    "is presented in table 1 , where the literature values of the atmospheric parameters ( the same as in paper i ) , apparent @xmath17 magnitudes ( from simbad database ) , and @xmath18 values ( ratio of the x - ray flux to the total bolometric flux ) available in rosat archival data ( accessible from the heasarc web sitehttp://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/@xmath19 . ] ) are also given .",
    "the observational data are the @xmath12-band ( 1.041.19  @xmath20 m ) spectra with @xmath21 ( wavelength resolution ) and s / n  @xmath22  100200 ( signal - to - noise ratio ; @xmath23 only for bd+44@xmath24493 ) , which were obtained on 2009 july 29 and 30 ( ut ) with the infrared camera and spectrograph ( ircs ) along with the 188-element curvature - based adaptive optics system ( ao188 ) of the subaru telescope .",
    "see section 2 of paper i for the details of the observation and the data reduction procedure .    since several appreciable telluric lines ( due to h@xmath25o vapor )",
    "are located in the neighborhood of the he  i 10830 line , we removed them by dividing each stellar spectrum by that of a rapid rotator ( @xmath26  tri ) with the help the task `` telluric '' in iraf .",
    "this procedure turned out quite successful , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "the finally resulting spectra , which were used for measuring the he  i 10830 line , are displayed in figure 2 .",
    "regarding the sun , we adopted the solar flux spectrum published by kurucz et al .",
    "( 1984 ) .",
    "the he  i 10830  @xmath0 triplet ( 2s@xmath32p@xmath27 ) comprises three components at 10829.088 , 10830.247 , and 10830.336  @xmath0 ( with @xmath28 of @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , respectively).http://vald.astro.univie.ac.at/@xmath19 .",
    "] however , since the first component is considerably weaker than and separated from the others , the latter two close components essentially determine the position of the stellar he  i 10830 line .    first of all",
    ", the important fact manifestly recognized from figure 2 is that this he  i line is clearly visible ( in absorption ) in most of the program stars ; i.e. , not only metal - rich stars of disk population but also old very metal - poor stars ( even in the extremely metal - poor star bd+44@xmath24493 with [ fe / h ]  @xmath32 ) .",
    "this is a reconfirmation of the previous report ( based on ca  ii , mg  ii , and ly  @xmath10 lines ) that chromospheres ubiquitously exist in old population  ii solar - type stars ( smith & churchill 1998 ; peterson & schrijver 1997 , 2001 ) ; but our result substantiates this fact in a more convincing manner for a larger number of stars in a much wider metallicity range than ever before .",
    "the equivalent width ( @xmath33 ) of the he  i 10830 line was evaluated for each star by the gaussian fitting , as depicted in figure 2 .",
    "we tried to measure @xmath33 as long as ( i ) the center of the absorption feature situates at almost the expected wavelength of the he  i 10830 line , and ( ii ) the line profile is not too severely blended .",
    "generally , `` low - gravity '' giants ( with @xmath34 ) tend to show appreciably blue - shifted components , making the profile complex or blended with the neighboring si  i line at 10827.1  @xmath0 , which must be due to the significant gas outflow typically seen in red - giant atmospheres ( e.g. , dupree et al . 2009 ) .",
    "so we had to abandon measuring @xmath33s for four low - gravity giants ( hd  122563 , hd  204543 , hd  121135 , and arcturus ) .",
    "as a result , since the @xmath33 data for `` giants '' ( with @xmath35 ) turned out insufficient ( only five stars ) , we will focus our discussion only on the 24 `` dwarf '' stars in the remainder of this paper ( unless otherwise specially noted ) , given that the main aim of this paper is to investigate the chromospheric activity of population  ii `` solar - type '' stars .    the line - depth ( @xmath36 ) ,",
    "the full - width at half - maximum ( @xmath37 ) , and the equivalent width ( @xmath33 ) corresponding to the fitted gaussian profile are given in table 1 , while figure 3 shows how the resulting @xmath38 values are correlated with [ fe / h ] .",
    "uncertainties in @xmath33 caused by photometric random errors may be estimated by invoking the formula derived by cayrel ( 1988 ) , who showed that the ambiguity in @xmath33 is roughly expressed as @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the typical line fwhm , @xmath41 is the pixel size ( in unit of wavelength ) , and @xmath42 is the photometric accuracy represented by @xmath22  ( s / n)@xmath43 .",
    "substituting @xmath44  @xmath0 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 , we obtain @xmath47  8  m@xmath0 as the uncertainty in @xmath33 . considering that typical",
    "@xmath33 is @xmath48  m@xmath0 in the present case , corresponding to @xmath49  0.1  dex in @xmath38 .",
    "meanwhile , since the continuum level could be reasonably defined to @xmath50  1020% of the line - depth for most of the cases ( cf . figure 2 ) , the errors in @xmath38 due to uncertainties in the continuum placement are estimated to be again @xmath50  0.1  dex .",
    "accordingly , combining these two factors , we may state that the ambiguity in @xmath38 is on the order of @xmath49  0.1  dex ( @xmath22  2030% in @xmath33 ) .",
    "an inspection of figure 3 reveals the following notable chracteristics . while we can not say much about giants ( open circles ) because of their paucity , which tend to show a rather large spread between @xmath51  1 ad @xmath47  2 , dwarfs ( filled circles ) exhibit a significant trend in terms of the metallicity .",
    "that is , its strength is nearly constant around @xmath52 over the wide metallicity range of @xmath13  [ fe / h ]  @xmath53 , while it tends to somewhat strengthen ( in the average sense ) up to @xmath54 for comparatively metal - rich stars at @xmath55  [ fe / h ] ( hd  131156 = @xmath56  boo  a shows an exceptionally large strength of @xmath57 , which is a well - known active star with large spots on its surface as characterized by the detection of its magnetic field by robinson et al .",
    "1980 ) .    for the purpose of corroborating this relation , we increased the data poits by adding the literature results taken from zarro and zirin ( 1986 ) and dupree et al .",
    "( 2009 ) as displayed separately for dwarfs ( figure 4a ) and giants ( figure 4b ) . considering the large variation of @xmath33(dwarfs ) in the metal - rich domain around [ fe / h ]  @xmath58 as manifestly seen in figure 4a",
    ", we may regard that such an apparent increase in the ( averaged ) @xmath33(dwarfs ) at @xmath55  [ fe / h ] seen in our data ( figure 3 ) simply reflects the difference in the dispersion of @xmath33(dwarfs ) between the [ fe / h ]  @xmath53 group ( small dispersion ) and @xmath55  [ fe / h ] group ( considerably large dispersion ) .",
    "it may be worth stressing that such a near - constancy in @xmath33 for metal - poor stars at [ fe / h ]  @xmath53 is restricted to `` dwarf '' stars , since @xmath33(giants ) show a considerably large scatter irrespective of the metallicity ( figure 4b ) .",
    "further , we plotted the measured @xmath33 against @xmath18 observed by rosat ( available only 8 apparently bright dwarf stars of @xmath59 at @xmath60  [ fe / h ] ; cf .",
    "table 1 ) in figure 5 .",
    "we can see from this figure that our data reasonably follow the tendency exhibited by the various published data compiled by zarro and zirin ( 1986 ) .",

    ", we may speculate that different types of chromospheres are involved between these two cases : + (1 ) for comparatively young thin - disk stars ( @xmath55  [ fe / h ] ; where a markedly large dispersion in @xmath33 is observed ) , which still show appreciable rotational velocities , stellar rotation plays the decisive role in controlling the chromospheric activity , for which organized magnetic fields generated by a dynamo ( which is induced by the differential rotation ) are responsible .",

    "instead , a chromospheric activity at the `` basal '' or minimum level ( e.g. , schrijver 1987 ; rutten et al .",
    "1991 ) comes into sight , which is maintained irrespective of stellar rotation . regarding the specific mechanism responsible for such a `` basal '' chromosphere , acoustic waves generated by convection ( apparently independent of rotation ) may be promising ( e.g. , schrijver 1995 ; narain & ulmschneider 1996 ;",
    "see also the discussion in peterson & schrijver 1997 , 2001 ) .",
    "we point out that , in order to test the `` basal chromosphere '' scenario mentioned above , long - term observations ( over @xmath8 years or more ) monitoring the activity of old metal - poor stars may be worth carrying out , since those stars would not show any near - cyclic activity variation such as that exhibited by the sun or nearby solar - type stars .",
    "the he  i 10830 line ( a good chromospheric indicator as evidenced by its close connection with the ca  ii h+k core emission in the sun seen as a star ; e.g. , livingston et al .",
    "2007 ) would be most suitable for this purpose , as it can be used even for extremely metal - deficient stars ( unlike ca  ii h+k ) and its observation can be done from the ground ( unlike mg  ii @xmath6 or lyman  @xmath10 ) .      to make this discussion complete , we should remark that our argument is based on the ( intuitively reasonable ) postulation that rotational velocities of old metal - poor stars are appreciably slowed down compared with those of younger metal - rich stars .",
    "it is thus important to check if such a tendency is really observed .",
    "but embarrassingly , according to the literature data compiled by cortes et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , metal - deficient stars ( [ fe / h ] @xmath62 ) in our sample show even _ higher _ @xmath63 values than metal - rich stars as shown in figure 6 , which is just the opposite to our expectation . however , considering the enormous difficulty involved with @xmath63 determinations of slow rotators as low as @xmath6412  km  s@xmath43 ( i.e. , contribution of the macroturbulence is almost predominant over the rotational effect on the line profile ) , we are still conservative and rather reluctant to take these results seriously , which are based on not - so - high quality spectra and subject to errors on the same order of the @xmath63 values themselves ( cf .",

    "( 2010 ; cf . section 3 therein ) .",
    "we then obtained almost the same results of @xmath68  2.32.4  km  s@xmath43 for both stars , which suggests that the @xmath63 values of 3.9  km  s@xmath43 ( bd+44@xmath24493 ) and 5.0  km  s@xmath43 ( hd  140283 ) given in table 3 of cortes et al .",
    "( 2009 ) are erroneously overestimated . ] in any event , if it were really confirmed based on reliable observations that rotations of old stars are not decelerated ( or even accelerated ) , then we would have to earnestly reconsider the stellar activity of metal - poor stars in a completely different paradigm .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)figure6.eps      given that the existence of high - temperature layer ( @xmath69  k ) in the upper atmosphere of any solar - type stars ( regardless of the metallicity ) has been established , we have some concern about whether this effect may have any influence on the analysis of stellar spectra ( e.g. , chemical abundance determinations ) , where conventional model atmospheres ( with monotonically decreasing temperatures outwards ) are exclusively relied upon . actually , the same situation applied even in the recent state - of - the - art 3d inhomogeneous hydrodynamical model atmospheres , where the averaged temperatures are nearly the same ( for the solar metallicity ) or even appreciably _ lowered _",
    "( for the metal - poor condition ) compared to the classical 1d model ( see , e.g. , figures 1 and 2 in asplund 2005 ) , reflecting the fact that any physical process ( e.g. , dissipation of acoustic energy ) leading to formation of chromospheres is not included in the current 3d models . thus , such a difference in the temperature structure may have some appreciable effect on the spectral line formation ( especially for high - forming strong lines ) , though it is not easy to make a general prediction without any detailed calculation .",
    "for example , the core flux of the strong ca  ii lines ( e.g. , doublet lines at 3934/3968  @xmath0 or triplet lines at 8498/8542/8662  @xmath0 ) tends to be raised by an increase in the surface temperature ( cf .",

    "2010 ) . on the contrary",
    ", the core of the high - excitation o  i lines ( e.g. , triplet lines at 77715  @xmath0 or 8446  @xmath0 ) gets _ deepened _ ( though slightly ) by the chromospheric temperature rise , as shown by takeda ( 1995 ) .",
    "besides , even for ordinary ( comparatively weak ) spectral lines , which are deep - forming and appear to be practically unaffected by any temperature structure in high optically - thin layers , a _ non - local _ effect of chromospheric radiation could be of significance , since emission of photons followed by electron recombination is considerably enhanced in the chromosphere reflecting that recombination rates are sensitive to the local electron temperature ( @xmath70 ) with a dependence of @xmath71 ( where wien s approximation is hold ; @xmath72 : planck constant , @xmath73 : boltzmann constant ) .",
    "this effect might influence the ionization equilibrium of any element , especially in metal - deficient atmospheres where such extra radiation of chromospheric origin has a higher possibility to reach the lower photosphere without being absorbed .",
    "based on the near - ir spectra of 33 late - type stars ( 9 giants and 24 dwarfs ) in the wide metallicity range ( @xmath13  [ fe / h ]  @xmath14 ) , which were obtained with ircs+ao188 of the subaru telescope , we examined whether the he  i 10830 line is visible and how its strength behaves itself in the metal - poor regime , in order to investigate the chromospheric activity in these stars .",
    "we confirmed that this line is seen in absorption in almost all stars ; i.e. , not only metal - rich stars of disk population but also extremely metal - poor stars ( down to [ fe / h ]  @xmath32 ) .",
    "this manifestly indicates that chromospheres ubiquitously exist in these fgk - type stars regardless of the metallicity or age .",
    "the equivalent width of this line turned out nearly constant at @xmath74 over the wide metallicity range of @xmath13  [ fe / h ]  @xmath53 corresponding to old halo and thick - disk stars , while it tends to show a large scatter ( many clustering around @xmath54 on the average ) for comparatively young thin - disk stars at @xmath55  [ fe / h ] , from which we may speculate that the origin of chromospheres is different between these two star groups .    for the latter group of thin - disk stars , still showing appreciable rotational velocities , stellar rotation may play the decisive role in controlling the chromospheric activity , for which organized magnetic fields generated by rotation - induced dynamo would be responsible , as widely believed .",
    "the difference in the rotational velocity would be the reason why @xmath33s in this group are diversified",
    ".    meanwhile , the standard rotation / magnetism - induced activity would not be relevant any more for the former group of old halo or thick - disk stars , whose rotational velocity should have been considerably slowed down . instead , a constant `` basal''-level chromospheric activity would come into sight , for which energy dissipation of acoustic waves generated by convection may be a promising heating mechanism .",
    "long - term observations monitoring the activity of old metal - poor stars would be useful to substantiate this hypothesis , since such stars would not show any activity variation .    yet , we should also keep in mind that this scenario is based on the widely believed hypothesis that stellar rotation generally gets slowed down with age as a result of the magnetic braking effect .",
    "it is therefore important to check whether rotational velocities of old metal - poor stars tend to be slower than those of young stars . given the enormous difficulty of establishing @xmath63 of considerably slow rotators , however , this would not be an easy task ( even the inverse trend is suggested from the literature data of the present sample stars , though its credibility is questionable ) .",

    "<S> based on the near - ir spectra of 33 late - type stars in the wide metallicity range ( mainly dwarfs and partly giants ) obtained with ircs+ao188 of the subaru telescope , we confirmed that he  i 10830  @xmath0 line is seen in absorption in almost all moderately to extremely metal - poor stars of thick disk and halo population ( from [ fe / h ]  @xmath1 down to [ fe / h ]  @xmath2 ) , the strength of which is almost constant irrespective of the metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> this is an evidence that chromospheric activity at a basal level persists even for such old stars , despite that their rotations are considered to be slowed down and incapable of sustaining a dynamo , suggesting that some kind of chromospheric heating mechanism independent of rotation / magnetism ( e.g. , acoustic heating ) may take place . </S>"
