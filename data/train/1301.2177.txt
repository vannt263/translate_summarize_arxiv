    "another equivalent way to view the functions @xmath15 is to consider the lattice @xmath16 and the convex body ( in fact the parallelepiped ) @xmath17 defined as the set of points @xmath18 with    @xmath19    and to define @xmath20 as the @xmath11-th _ successive minimum _ of @xmath21 with respect to @xmath17 .",
    "this @xmath11-th minimum is defined as the infimum over all @xmath22 for which the @xmath23-span of @xmath24 has dimension at least @xmath11 , or equivalently @xmath25 contains @xmath11 linearly independent points of @xmath21 .",

    "@xmath32 see @xcite , so that in our special case , as @xmath33 for every @xmath34 , we have @xmath35 uniformly in the parameter @xmath34 . with @xmath36 and taking logarithms , this yields    @xmath37    with some constant @xmath38 not depending on @xmath34 .",
    "+ another important property of the joint behaviour of the functions @xmath15 is that for any given @xmath39 there are arbitrarily large values @xmath40 such that    @xmath41    provided that @xmath42 are linearly independent over @xmath43 , see theorem 1.1 in @xcite . to quantify the behaviour of @xmath8 summerer and schmidt introduced the quantities    @xmath44 and gave the estimates    @xmath45    where ( [ eq:1001alk ] ) requires @xmath42 to be linearly independent over @xmath43 again .",

    "we will be able to give an explicit example of a vector @xmath0 that shows a conjecture by wolfgang schmidt concerning successive minima of a lattice to be true . a non - constructive proof was given by moshchevitin in a nonconstructive way .",
    "moreover we will construct cases where all functions @xmath15 simultaneously take all possible values of their spectrum for arbitrarily large @xmath34 .",

    "these plots shall also lead to some insight into the dynamical behaviour of these functions in general .",
    "one should mention at this point that the plots often seem curved although the functions are piecewise linear , which is due to the non sufficient digital reslution , i.e. by zooming in one can see that they are indeed piecewise linear .",
