    "in this paper , we are especially interested in metric regularity of the sum of two multifunctions .",
    "the starting point of the study is the famous lyusternik - graves theorem @xcite , which reduces the problem of regularity of a strictly differentiable single - valued mapping between banach spaces to that of its linear approximation .",
    "historical comments and modern interpretations and extensions of this theorem can be found in @xcite .",
    "particularly , it was observed in dmitruk , milyutin & osmolovsky @xcite that the original lyusternik s proof in @xcite is applicable to a much more general setting : the sum of a covering at a rate mapping and a lipschitz one with suitable constants is covering at the rate .",
    "extensions to the case of the sum of a metrically regular set - valued mapping and a single - valued lipschitz map with suitable constants appear in @xcite , ( see the references therein for more details ) . for the parametric case ,",
    "it is well - known ( see for instance , dmitruk & kruger @xcite , aragn artacho , dontchev , gaydu , geoffroy , and veliov @xcite ) that , if we perturb a metrically regular mapping @xmath0 by a mapping @xmath1 , lipschitz with respect to @xmath2 , uniformly in @xmath3 , with a sufficiently small lipschitz constant , then the perturbed mapping @xmath4 is metrically regular for every @xmath3 near @xmath5 .",
    "more generally , ioffe @xcite extended this result to the case of the sum of a metrically regular multifunction and a lipschitz one , and also to the more general case , when if a multifunction @xmath6 is sufficiently close to the given metrically regular multifunction @xmath0 in the sense given in @xcite , then @xmath6 is necessarily metrically regular , with suitable constants ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "when we perturb a metrically regular multifunction by another set - valued mapping which is pseudo - lipschitz , the perturbed mapping , i.e. , the sum set - valued mapping fails in general to be metrically regular , ( we refer to the example in the next section ) .",
    "however , if for example the so - called `` sum - stability '' property ( introduced below ) holds , then the metric regularityf , as well as the pseudo - lipschitz property of the variational system , remains .",
    "recently , durea & strugariu @xcite considered the sum of two set - valued mappings and obtained a result very similar to openness of the sum of two set - valued mappings .",
    "they also gave some applications to generalized variational systems .",
    "motivated by the ideas and results from @xcite , we attack these problems by using a different approach and with rather different assumptions . indeed , using an approach based on the theory of error bounds , we study metric regularity of a special multifunction called the epigraphical multifunction associated to @xmath0 and @xmath6 .",
    "this intermediate result allows us to study metric regularity/ linear openness of the sum of two set - valued mappings , as well as metric regularity of the general variational system , avoiding the strong assumption of the closedness of the sum multifunction .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "section 2 is devoted to preliminaries where we introduce the problem of generalized parametric inclusions .",
    "we give some illustrations through examples and we present a small survey on different notion of regularity . in section 3 ,",
    "we recall some recent results on error bounds of parametrized systems and give , sometimes with some modifications , characterizations of metric regularity of multifunctions given in @xcite . in section 4 , in the context of asplund spaces , we estimate the strong slope of the lower semicontinuous envelope of the distance function to the epigraphical multifunction associated to two given multifunctions @xmath0 and @xmath6 . then , we give sufficient conditions as well as a point - based condition for metric regularity of this epigraphical multifunction under a coderivative condition . in the last section , we study robinson metric regularity and aubin property of a generalized variational system .",
    "generalized equations , i.e. , inclusions of the type @xmath7 involving a multifunction @xmath8 where @xmath9 are metric spaces , and @xmath10 is a topological space considered as the space of parameters , have been extensively used for modeling optimization and complementarity problems , as well as variational inequalities since the pioneering work of robinson @xcite .",
    "the study of generalized equations constitute the core of the development of set - valued analysis @xcite which is one of the main corner - stones of variational analysis , see , e.g. , books @xcite .",
    "a typical example of ( [ a ] ) is given by a parametrized system of inequalities / equalities .",
    "more precisely , let us consider the system @xmath11 consisting of those points @xmath2 for which @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the decision variable , @xmath14 a parameter and for each @xmath15 and the @xmath16 are functions from @xmath17 to @xmath18 .",
    "setting @xmath19 and @xmath20 the system @xmath21 can be reformulated in the form @xmath22 ) .",
    "let us also note that @xmath23 includes the important subcase of parametrized _ generalized inclusions _ : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a set - valued mapping and @xmath26 is a mapping .",
    "let us consider the perturbed optimization problem @xmath27 @xmath28,\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is a frchet differentiable function , and @xmath30 is a given parameter .",
    "the first order optimality condition of problem @xmath27 is given by @xmath31 here @xmath32 stands for the normal cone mapping defined by @xmath33 if @xmath34 , and @xmath35 otherwise .",
    "setting @xmath36 relation @xmath37 takes the form @xmath38 hence , the first order optimality condition satisfies the generalized variational inequality @xmath39 and appears as a special case of equation @xmath40 .",
    "the study of variational properties and stability of the solutions of equation ( [ a ] ) has attracted a large interest from a large number of authors , and we refer the reader to the monographs @xcite and the references therein .",
    "let us first provide definitions and properties of some essential notions from set - valued analysis that will be used throughout this paper . in what follows , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , etc .",
    ", unless specified otherwise , are metric spaces , and we use the same symbol @xmath43 to denote the distance in all of them or between a point @xmath2 to a subset @xmath44 of one of them : @xmath45 by @xmath46 and @xmath47 we denote the open and closed balls of radius @xmath48 around @xmath2 , while , if @xmath41 is a normed linear space , we use the notations @xmath49 for the open and the closed unit balls , respectively . by a multifunction ( set - valued mapping ) @xmath50 , we mean a mapping from @xmath41 into the subsets ( possibly empty ) of @xmath42 .",
    "we denote by @xmath51 the graph of @xmath52 , that is the set @xmath53 , and by @xmath54 the domain of @xmath52 .",
    "when @xmath52 has a closed graph , we say that @xmath52 is a closed multifunction .",
    "since various types of multifunctions arise in a considerable number of models ranging from mathematical programs , through game theory and to control and design problems , they represent probably the most developed class of objects in variational analysis .",
    "a number of useful regularity properties have been introduced and investigated ( see @xcite and the references therein ) . among them ,",
    "the most popular is that of metric regularity ( @xcite ) , the root of which can be traced back to the classical banach open mapping theorem and the subsequent fundamental results of lyusternik and graves ( @xcite ) .",
    "a multifunction @xmath0 is said to be _ metrically regular _",
    "around @xmath55 with modulus @xmath56 , whenever there exist neighborhoods @xmath57 of @xmath58 respectively , such that , for every @xmath59@xmath60 a classical illustration of this concept concerns the case when @xmath0 is a bounded linear continuous operator .",
    "then , metric regularity of @xmath0 amounts to saying that @xmath0 is surjective . in terms of the inverse mapping @xmath61",
    ", property @xmath62 can be rewritten equivalently as follows : @xmath63 this gives rise to another well known concept called _ pseudo - lipschitz property _ , also called lipschitz - like property ( see@xcite ) , or _ aubin property _ ( see@xcite ) at @xmath64 .",
    "the concept of _ openness _ or _ covering ( at a linear rate ) _ is also widely used : one says that @xmath65 is _ open at linear rate _",
    "@xmath56 around @xmath66 iff there exist neighborhoods @xmath57 of @xmath58 respectively and , a positive number @xmath67 such that , for every @xmath68 and every @xmath690,\\varepsilon[,$]@xmath70 we refer to @xcite and the references therein for different developments of these notions .",
    "the following relation is well established : @xmath71 let us also add that in banach spaces , similarly to the classical calculus , one can formulate sufficient ( sub)differential characterizations of properties @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in asplund spaces",
    "( see@xcite for definitions and characterizations of asplund spaces ) , the corresponding characterizations in terms of frchet subdifferentials ( @xcite ) or their limiting counterparts ( @xcite ) and the corresponding coderivatives become necessary and sufficient .    from the point of view of applications to optimization",
    "( sensitivity analysis , convergence analysis of algorithms , and penalty functions methods ) , one of the most important regularity properties seems to be that of error bounds , providing an estimate for the distance of a point from the solution set .",
    "this theory was initiated by the pioneering work by hoffman @xcite .",
    "a general classification scheme of necessary and sufficient criteria for the error bound property is presented in @xcite .",
    "applications of the theory of error bounds to the investigation of metric regularity of multifunctions have been recently studied and developed by many authors , including for instance @xcite .",
    "let us remind some basic notions used in the paper .",
    "let @xmath74 be a given extended - real - valued function . as usual , @xmath75 denotes the domain of @xmath76 .",
    "we recall the concept of error bounds that is one of the most important regularity properties .",
