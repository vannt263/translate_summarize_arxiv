    "as a white dwarf star cools over time , from a hot planetary nebula nucleus down to the coolest temperatures possible given the finite age of the universe , there are three narrow ranges of surface temperature where they may become pulsationally excited .",
    "the particular interval where a given white dwarf will pulsate is determined by its spectral type .",
    "the pg  1159 stars or variable do white dwarfs are the hottest class , and require detailed evolutionary models for an accurate pulsational analysis . the cooler helium - atmosphere ( db ) and hydrogen - atmosphere ( da ) variables are both easier to model , since relatively simple polytropic models may be used to approximate their evolution quite accurately @xcite .",
    "the db variables ( dbvs ) are structurally the simplest , since they have a single surface layer of helium on top of a presumed carbon / oxygen ( c / o ) core , while da variables ( davs ) have an additional surface layer of hydrogen above this helium mantle .",
    "although our theoretical models of variable white dwarfs are relatively simple , they have been able to match the observed pulsation periods of these stars with a degree of accuracy that  with the exception of the sun  is unsurpassed in the field of stellar seismology . in part , this achievement has been made possible by the simplifying physical circumstances : the absence of nuclear fusion , the extremely high surface gravity ( @xmath1 ) , slow rotation ( @xmath2 d ) , and negligible magnetic fields . however , the most recent improvements in the agreement between models and observations have been driven more by global explorations of the defining parameters of existing models , rather than by fundamental changes to the models themselves .    by combining improved models with objective global optimization methods ,",
    "we may eventually obtain physically complete and fully self - consistent theoretical models of white dwarf stars . until then , we can rely on the _ relative _ quality of the match between our models and observations as a proxy for the _ absolute _ optimization that would be possible if our models were physically complete descriptions of real white dwarfs .",
    "this may lead to systematic errors in the values of some of our parameters , depending on the nature of the incompleteness , but it will allow us to proceed and to develop useful algorithms for diagnosing the limiting assumptions in our models .",
    "recently , @xcite have given a detailed description of a method developed to match simple models of dbv white dwarfs to the available observations .",
    "the method itself is perfectly general , and may easily be extended to other types of pulsating stars . in the context of dbv white",
    "dwarfs it has been used , among other things , to infer the internal mixture of carbon and oxygen  the most important source of uncertainty in age estimates from white dwarf cosmochronometry  and , by extension , the rate of the key @xmath0  reaction .",
    "the initial applications of this method to two white dwarfs , first to the brightest dbv star , gd  358 @xcite , and then to the faintest member of the class , cbs  114 @xcite , yielded apparently conflicting results .",
    "here , i will demonstrate that the apparent conflict arose from systematic differences in how the two data sets were analyzed .",
    "when the optimum models are determined using identical criteria , both stars yield internal compositions that imply rates for the @xmath0  reaction that are consistent with one another , and which both agree with recent extrapolations from high - energy laboratory measurements .",
    "the global optimization method for dbv white dwarf models , based on the publicly available genetic algorithm pikaia @xcite , was developed by @xcite and later extended by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter mwc ) to allow five adjustable parameters .",
    "the method attempts to minimize the differences between the observed and calculated periods and period spacings for models with effective temperatures ( @xmath3 ) between 20,000 and 30,000 k , total stellar masses ( @xmath4 ) between 0.45 and 0.95 @xmath5 , helium layer masses with @xmath6 between 2.0 and @xmath77.0 , and an internal c / o profile with a constant oxygen mass fraction ( @xmath8 ) out to some fractional mass ( @xmath9 ) where it then decreases linearly in mass to zero oxygen at @xmath10 .",
    "the broad range of the search is limited only by observational constraints and by the physics of the models .",
    "the observational data for gd  358 came from an extremely successful multi - site campaign in 1990 by the whole earth telescope collaboration ( wet ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the results and analysis of these observations were reported by @xcite and ( * ? ? ? * hereafter bw ) who conclusively identified a series of 11 consecutive radial overtones ( @xmath11=8 - 18 ) of non - radial g - mode pulsations with the same spherical degree ( @xmath12=1 ) . using this rich data set",
    ", bw attempted to match the periods themselves ( @xmath13 ) as well as the spacings between consecutive modes ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "when confined to search the same range of parameters considered in this initial study , mwc found the same optimal set of model parameters as bw .",
    "but the global search revealed a significantly better model outside the range of the initial search , with optimal parameters @xmath15 k , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and root - mean - square ( rms ) residuals @xmath20 s , and @xmath21 s.    the central oxygen mass fraction in white dwarf models is primarily determined by the rate of the @xmath0  reaction .",
    "the extent and efficiency of internal mixing during the red giant phase is a secondary factor ( see  [ discussionsec ] ) .",
    "this allowed @xcite to adjust the @xmath0  rate in evolutionary models of the internal chemical profiles until they produced the optimal value of @xmath8 for gd  358 .",
    "the implied reaction rate was @xmath22 kev barns , significantly higher than most extrapolations from high - energy laboratory measurements .",
    "the authors noted that the application of this method to additional dbv white dwarfs could provide independent measurements of this important nuclear reaction rate .    although cbs  114 is the faintest known dbv , single - site observations from saao in 2001 @xcite , combined with a reanalysis of the discovery data of @xcite , revealed 7 stable pulsation modes with periods between about 400 - 650 seconds .",
    "the mean period spacing was consistent with non - radial g - mode pulsations of spherical degree @xmath12=1 , and a comparison with models identified the radial overtones as @xmath11=8,9 and 11 - 15 , with the @xmath11=10 mode undetected .",
    "the global analysis of these pulsation data had to be restricted to comparing the observed and calculated periods  neglecting the period spacings because of the undetected mode that interrupts the sequence of otherwise consecutive radial overtones .",
    "the optimal values for the five model parameters were @xmath23 k , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and the rms period residuals were @xmath28 s. this fit matched the observed periods so closely that it also reproduced the observed deviations from the mean period spacing ( an alternate period spacing criterion ) almost exactly ( see * ? ? ? * fig .",
    "the higher stellar mass for cbs  114 relative to gd  358 should naturally lead to a _ slightly lower _ central oxygen mass fraction , since the @xmath0  reaction is slightly less efficient at higher densities .",
    "however , the internal chemical profile models with the appropriate mass required a rate for the @xmath0  reaction of only @xmath29 kev barns to reproduce the optimal central oxygen mass fraction .",
    "this is very close to the rate derived from recent laboratory measurements ( @xmath30 kev barns ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the conflicting results for gd  358 and cbs  114 led @xcite to speculate that either some source of systematic uncertainty in the models was affecting the analysis of the two stars in different ways , or that they may have different evolutionary origins .",
    "the easiest way to test the second idea would be to apply the method to an additional dbv star , and see if the internal composition agreed with either of the other two .",
    "although the wet recently conducted a multi - site campaign on the dbv star pg  1456 + 103 , the analysis of those data are still in progress .",
    "thus , i have attempted to follow up on the first possibility , and identify possible sources of systematic error .",
    "one obvious systematic problem with both of the fits , as noted in each of the initial analyses , was the disagreement between the optimal masses and temperatures and the values of these parameters from the spectroscopic analysis of @xcite . both global fits produced masses that were systematically high , and temperatures that were systematically low .",
    "some discrepancy was expected , since the two methods assumed slightly different values for the mixing - length / pressure scale height ratio for atmospheric convection . in addition , the simple polytropic models used for the global fits included static envelopes containing 5% of the total stellar mass .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that by reducing the fractional mass of these static envelopes to only 2% , the mass and temperature of the optimal model for gd  358 were in closer agreement with the spectroscopic values . in any case , neither of these two problems should be responsible for the differences between the results for gd  358 and cbs  114 , since both problems were common to the two analyses .    upon reflection , there were two things that _ did _ differ between the analyses of the two stars : ( 1 ) the fit to gd  358 used the periods _ and _ the period spacings to judge the quality of the match , and ( 2 ) there were a larger number of higher radial overtone modes in the case of gd  358 . to evaluate whether or not these subtleties could be responsible for the differences between the derived values of the central oxygen mass fraction",
    ", we can look at a small grid of models with various values of @xmath8 and @xmath9 keeping the mass , temperature , and helium layer mass fixed at their optimal values .",
    "the effect of these two differences on the determination of the central oxygen mass fraction for gd  358 are illustrated in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "each panel shows the optimal combination of @xmath8 and @xmath9 for a given fitting criterion in black , along with the ranges of model parameters leading to rms residuals that differ from those of the optimal combination by 1 , 3 , and 10 times the observational uncertainty ( @xmath31 s ) , shown in progressively lighter shades of grey .",
    "the difference between the distributions in the top two panels demonstrates that when the period spacings are used in addition to the periods themselves for fitting , the effect is to bias the central oxygen mass fraction toward higher values and to increase the uncertainty in the optimal value of @xmath8 . comparing the top and bottom panels ,",
    "it is clear that attempts to match only those radial overtones observed in cbs  114 may lead to systematically lower values for @xmath8 . in principle",
    ", these two results would lead us to expect that the initial determination of @xmath8 for gd  358 may have overestimated the actual value due to the use of period spacings for fitting , and the value for cbs  114 may have been an underestimate since there were fewer modes of higher radial overtone . in practice , this exercise can not provide _ quantitative _ information about the expected shifts , since the three model parameters that were fixed for figure  [ fig1 ] will undoubtedly shift slightly in a full re - optimization .",
    "motivated by the qualitative evidence from figure  [ fig1 ] , i performed several new fits using the global model - fitting procedure of mwc .",
    "since i also wanted to reconcile the discrepancies between the masses and temperatures inferred from asteroseismology and spectroscopy , the new fits used the so - called `` ml2/@xmath32=1.25 '' prescription for convection adopted for the spectroscopic fits by @xcite rather than the `` ml3 '' prescription used by mwc .",
    "both prescriptions follow the same mixing - length theory of @xcite , but assign different values ( 1.25 and 2.0 respectively ) to the mixing - length / pressure scale height ratio .",
    "each of the new fits use only the periods ( and _ not _ the period spacings ) to determine the optimal model , which also makes them directly comparable to the alternative model fit of @xcite .",
    "the values of the globally optimal model parameters for the new fits are listed in table  [ tab1 ] , along with the rms differences between the observed and calculated periods ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "note that the period residuals for the `` gd  358 [ 11 ] '' fit are considerably smaller than in the fit of mwc ( which had @xmath20 s ) .",
    "the period residuals for cbs  114 also improved slightly , compared to the fit of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* which had @xmath28 s ) .",
    "small grids of models with various combinations of @xmath8 and @xmath9 , keeping the other parameters fixed , revealed that the formal 1@xmath34 statistical uncertainties on the central oxygen mass fraction for gd  358 and cbs  114 are near @xmath350.01 in both cases , but i adopt an uncertainty twice this size .    using the mass and central oxygen mass fraction to derive a measurement of the @xmath0  reaction rate is model - dependent . to facilitate comparison with previous results , i relied on the internal chemical profiles of metcalfe , salaris , &    winget ( 2002 ) and m.  salaris ( private communication ) .",
    "interpolating between these models , the @xmath0  reaction rate that was required to match the optimal values of the mass and central oxygen mass fraction for gd  358 and cbs  114 was @xmath36 kev barns and @xmath37 kev barns respectively .",
    "both measurements are in excellent agreement with the rate suggested by the nacre collaboration ( @xmath38 ; * ? ? ?",
    "this remarkable agreement is illustrated in figure  [ fig2 ] , which shows the ranges of internal chemical profiles corresponding to the nacre rate for a 0.65 @xmath5 white dwarf model ( from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) along with profiles scaled to match the optimal values of the central oxygen mass fraction for gd  358 and cbs  114 .",
    "note that the @xmath0  rates derived from the two stars are statistically indistinguishable , but the chemical profiles themselves do not overlap at the center because the models have different masses .",
    "both measurements are also consistent with the more recent laboratory value derived by ( * ? ? ?",

    "a re - analysis of the pulsation data for gd  358 and cbs  114 , with ml2/@xmath32=1.25 convection and using only the periods to determine the optimal models , yielded improved fits leading to measurements of the @xmath0  reaction rate that are both consistent with each other and with laboratory measurements .",
    "since a larger number of pulsation modes are present in gd  358 to constrain the fit , it should be considered the more reliable measurement .",
    "the influence of having fewer modes and lower radial overtones on the derived central oxygen mass fraction is ambiguous : for a given mass , temperature , and helium layer mass , it may lead to an underestimate ",
    "but when all parameters are allowed to re - adjust ( as in the `` gd  358 [ 7 ] '' fit in table [ tab1 ] ) it may lead to an overestimate .",
    "this underscores the importance of a global analysis when trying to determine the optimal model .",
    "the derived central oxygen mass fractions for these two dbvs are now perfectly consistent with each other  with a slightly lower value for the more massive white dwarf , as expected . mapping the internal chemical composition into a rate for the @xmath0  reaction",
    "is model - dependent , as discussed recently by @xcite , because the adopted mixing scheme and numerical treatment of breathing pulses are both important to the outcome . unless the detailed shape of white dwarf internal chemical profiles can be measured empirically through asteroseismology , or until some independent constraints on internal mixing are possible",
    ", this systematic uncertainty will remain .",
    "switching to the same convective prescription as was used in the spectroscopic analysis of @xcite did not resolve the systematic errors in the derived mass and temperature of either object .",
    "this outcome appears to be related to the simplified treatment of the surface helium layer and the use of static envelopes .",
    "models that include time - dependent diffusion in the envelopes , such as those of @xcite , reveal that the surface helium layers of dbv stars may contain a double - layered structure  with a relatively thin pure he layer overlying a thicker mixed he / c / o layer above the c / o core .",
    "the most extensive observational test for this structure has , so far , come from @xcite who calculated a grid of models with masses and temperatures near the spectroscopic values for gd  358 and compared the observed and calculated periods . by including these double - layered envelopes  but neglecting the theoretically expected composition and structure in the core ",
    "the authors were able to match the pulsation periods of gd  358 with the same level of precision as the fit of mwc , which used single - layered envelopes , ml3 convection , and a physically motivated c / o core .",
    "an analytical explanation of how these two models  one with extra structure in the core , and the other with extra structure in the envelope  can produce fits of comparable quality was recently provided by @xcite .",
    "composition transition zones at certain locations in the core and envelope can produce deviations from uniform period spacing that are difficult to distinguish from each other .",
    "this leads to a potential ambiguity between , for example , the expected c / o transition near @xmath46 and the outer he transition near @xmath47 . as a consequence ,",
    "it is crucial that we determine which feature has the largest imprint on the observed periods .",
    "the new fit for gd  358 in table [ tab1 ] is more directly comparable to @xcite s fit , since it also uses only the observed periods to determine the optimal model .",
    "even after accounting for the additional free parameter , the new fit has significantly lower residuals than the pure c double - layered envelope fit , suggesting that the internal c / o profile may be the more important of the two internal structures .",
    "however , the continued presence of a local minimum with @xmath48 in fits using single - layered models suggests that double - layered envelopes may improve the fit even further .",
    "@xcite have also concluded that improved fits to gd  358 may be possible using models that include _ both _ double - layered envelopes and a variable core composition .",
    "however , their calculations were limited to model grids using several _ uniform _ c / o mixtures , so they did not have access to any information contained in the residuals that might allow a determination of the c / o profile . in the initial results from an ongoing study ( metcalfe et al . , in preparation )",
    "we find that double - layered envelope models with an adjustable c / o profile yield significantly improved fits relative to models with a pure c core .",
    "clearly , the way forward is a thorough exploration of hybrid models with self - consistent double - layered envelopes and physically - motivated internal c / o profiles . with some luck",
    ", this may eventually reduce the rms residuals down to the level of the observational noise , and provide the most accurate value possible for the @xmath0  reaction rate ."
