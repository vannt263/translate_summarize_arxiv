    "mqmc - i has the normal van der waal - type loop at small densities reflecting the gas to liquid phase transition . in mqmc -",
    "ii the pressure has an additional sudden and significant drop at high densities @xmath208 for strangeness fractions @xmath209 .",
    "this dramatic drop in the pressure is due to the transition from the @xmath3 phase to the @xmath4 phase in strange hadronic matter and probably provides an experimental clue for it .",
    "in the present work , we have studied , within the context of the mqmc model , the properties of strange hadronic matter composed of the su(3 ) octet baryons @xmath121 and @xmath7 using two different models for the hyperon - hyperon interactions . it is interesting to note here that the medium dependent bag constant for each baryon species reflect more realistic self interaction with the scalar mean fields which are corresponding to the nonlinear terms of the scalar mean fields in the normal rmf calculations .",
    "mqmc - i is designed to mimic the consequences of the nijmegen hard - core potential model d @xcite .",
    "it is nevertheless constrained by @xmath6 and @xmath7 nuclear phenomenology , and by a few @xmath133 hypernuclear species reported to date .",
    "it accounts more realistically for the attractive @xmath133 and @xmath171 interactions , but ignores altogether @xmath2 hyperons . on the other hand , mqmc - ii",
    "is designed to generate qualitatively similar baryon potentials to those obtained in the bhf approximation from the su(3 ) extensions of the nijmegen soft - core nsc97 potential models .",
    "the nsc97 model has been tuned up to reproduce certain characteristics of @xmath6 hypernuclei , particularly its version nsc97f .",
    "it yields particularly attractive @xmath27 , @xmath26 and @xmath210 interactions .    in mqmc - i",
    ", the @xmath2 hyperons do not appear at all and the @xmath6 hyperons have a substantial contribution at low densities for medium strangeness fractions @xmath188 .",
    "however this contribution drops quickly and saturates for @xmath211 at a constant fraction density slightly larger than @xmath212 .",
    "this model produces smooth binding energy curves over the entire range of @xmath139 and @xmath138 and forms ( meta-)stable strange hadronic matter in the bulk .    due to the exceptionally strong attractive interactions among the @xmath2 and @xmath7 hyperons in mqmc - ii , the @xmath3- and @xmath171-dominated strange hadronic matter that exists for @xmath213",
    "is replaced by @xmath4-dominated matter for @xmath214 , with binding energies per baryon reaching as much as 56 mev for @xmath144 .",
    "the equation of state becomes much softer and seems to allow deeply bound hyperonic matter .",
    "the system built out of @xmath4 forms a particularly ( meta-)stable state of strange hadronic matter in the bulk .",
    "when the first order phase transition takes place above some critical baryon density and strangeness fraction , the @xmath2 hyperons appear and their contribution saturates rapidly to a constant fraction density that takes its maximum value of about @xmath192 at @xmath144 .",
    "it is expected that such a phase transition may drastically change the global features of neutron stars@xcite .",
    "our results for mqmc - ii are qualitatively similar to those of schaffner - bielich and gal @xcite where the same @xmath0 potentials of mqmc - ii ( what they call model n ) are employed within rmf theory but with only hadronic degrees of freedom .",
    "there are however some important quantitative differences .",
    "whereas in ref .",
    "@xcite it is found that the second energy minimum , corresponding to @xmath4 dominated matter , becomes more stable than the first minimum for @xmath19 , our current results indicate that this takes place at higher strangeness fractions @xmath214 . furthermore , the binding energy well for the @xmath4 system has a maximum depth of 56 mev in the present work while ref .",
    "@xcite finds the largest depth to be 78 mev . in both calculations",
    "the largest binding for the @xmath4 system takes place at @xmath215 .",
    "the fact that the phase transition takes place at larger strangeness fractions may make it more difficult to observe experimentally , if it occurs at all .",
    "finally , quark - quark correlations and excluded volume effects may become important at high baryon densities in particular when the bags start to overlap at baryon densities @xmath216 .",
    "we shall consider these effects on the properties of strange hadronic matter in our future work .",
