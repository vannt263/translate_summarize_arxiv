    "the existence and uniqueness of black hole solutions of the einstein equations with various types of matter has been a rich avenue of research for many years .",
    "the classic `` no - hair '' theorems ( see , for example , @xcite for a review ) proved the uniqueness of the kerr - newman family of metrics describing four - dimensional , asymptotically flat , black hole solutions of the einstein equations with an electromagnetic field or in a vacuum . more recently , there has been an explosion of interest in the generalization of these uniqueness results to higher - dimensional black holes , and particular , in the non - uniqueness of higher - dimensional rotating black holes ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "black hole solutions of the einstein - scalar field system have been studied for almost as long as those of the einstein - maxwell system ( see @xcite for a detailed review , and @xcite for a summary ) .",
    "the case of a minimally coupled scalar field has been the most extensively studied , with a number of `` no - hair '' results proved , in asymptotically flat space , particularly for static , spherically symmetric black holes @xcite .",
    "these results depend on some assumptions about the form of the self - interaction potential , typically that it is positive semi - definite . when these assumptions are not satisfied , asymptotically flat black hole and soliton solutions of the field equations can be constructed , some numerically with a particular choice of self - interaction potential @xcite , and there are also analytic solutions ( often with unusual potentials ) @xcite , which can be generated from vacuum solutions in the static case @xcite .    including a cosmological constant changes the picture for minimally coupled scalar fields , providing the self - interaction potential is non - zero @xcite .",
    "when the cosmological constant is positive , numerical @xcite and analytic @xcite black hole solutions have been found when the self - interaction potential is non - convex @xcite , although at least some of these solutions are unstable @xcite . on the other hand , with a negative cosmological constant , stable black holes with minimally coupled scalar field hair",
    "have been found numerically @xcite , and there are also some analytic solutions @xcite .",
    "such asymptotically anti - de sitter ( ads ) solutions have attracted much recent interest in the literature due to their interpretation via the ads / cft ( conformal field theory ) correspondence ( some works on this topic include @xcite ) , particularly for black holes with scalar hair in supergravity theories @xcite , although the latter are unstable @xcite .",
    "when non - minimal coupling of the scalar field to the ricci scalar curvature is included in the model , the case of conformal coupling has been of particular interest .",
    "the bbmb solution @xcite is the unique @xcite static , asymptotically flat , black hole solution of the field equations in four space - time dimensions , when the self - interaction potential is zero , but is unstable @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the scalar field diverges on the event horizon .",
    "an analytic solution has been found in asymptotically flat space when the scalar field self - interaction potential is non - zero @xcite .",
    "the analogue of the bbmb solution in four dimensions when there is a positive cosmological constant has a quartic self interaction potential @xcite .",
    "although the scalar field does not suffer from the divergences of the bbmb black hole , it is still unstable @xcite . as for minimal coupling , in the presence of a negative cosmological constant , four - dimensional stable solitons @xcite and black holes @xcite have been found when the self - interaction potential is either zero or quadratic .",
    "the case of non - minimal coupling which is not conformal coupling has received less attention in the literature . in four - dimensional , asymptotically flat , space - time , various black hole `` no - hair '' theorems have been proved @xcite . with a zero self - interaction potential ,",
    "four - dimensional black holes are studied in @xcite .",
    "it is found that non - minimally- and non - conformally - coupled scalar field hair can be supported by the black hole only when there is a negative cosmological constant , in agreement with numerical work @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the hair is stable only when the constant governing the coupling between the scalar field and the ricci scalar curvature is such that the breitenlohner - freedman bound @xcite on the `` effective mass '' is satisfied .    most of the above work is concerned with static , spherically symmetric black holes in four space - time dimensions . in asymptotically ads space , as well as",
    "spherically symmetric black holes , the well - known topological black holes exist ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "topological black holes with scalar field hair have not been widely studied , apart from an analytic solution in the minimally coupled case @xcite , and numerical solutions in the conformally coupled case @xcite .",
    "solitons and black holes with scalar hair in more than four space - time dimensions have received more attention in the literature in recent years , particularly in asymptotically ads space @xcite . the techniques for generating minimally coupled scalar solutions from solutions of the vacuum einstein equations have been generalized @xcite , yielding new analytic solutions . for conformally coupled scalar fields , there is no higher - dimensional analogue of the asymptotically flat bbmb black hole @xcite , although the corresponding analytic solution in three - dimensional , asymptotically ads space does exist @xcite , and there are numerical soliton and black hole solutions in ads in higher dimensions @xcite , all with vanishing self - interaction potential .",
    "a set of analytic solutions in various dimensions with a non - zero self - interaction potential and a cosmological constant has also been considered recently in the conformally coupled case @xcite . for other non - minimal coupling , saa @xcite has proved a no - hair theorem in the asymptotically flat case , although for certain values of the coupling constant assumptions on the magnitude of the scalar field are required .",
    "our purpose in this paper is to consider non - minimal , non - conformal coupling , extending the analysis of @xcite to solitons , higher - dimensional black holes , and topological black holes in asymptotically ads space .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we describe our scalar field model , the field equations and boundary conditions to be satisfied by soliton and black hole solutions , and the conformal map which transforms our non - minimally coupled scalar field system to one with a minimally coupled scalar field and a non - zero self - interaction potential . for most of the parameter space",
    ", we are able to prove that non - trivial solutions can not exist , and these non - existence results are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : no - hair ] .",
    "non - trivial solutions exist in the remainder of the parameter space , and in sec .",
    "[ sec : nontrivial ] we present our numerical solutions and study their thermodynamics and stability .",
    "finally our conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] .",
    "we consider the following action , describing a scalar field @xmath0 with non - minimal coupling to gravity in @xmath1 space - time dimensions : @xmath2 , \\label{eq : action}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the ricci scalar curvature , and we have included a cosmological constant @xmath4 . here and throughout this paper , the metric has signature @xmath5 and we use units in which @xmath6 . the constant @xmath7 governs the coupling between the scalar field and the ricci scalar curvature .",
    "two values of @xmath7 are particularly important : minimal coupling @xmath8 , and conformal coupling @xmath9 $ ] . in the action ( [ eq : action ] ) we have set any self - interaction potential to zero , for simplicity .",
    "we are interested in static , spherically symmetric , solitons and black holes for all values of the cosmological constant @xmath4 ; and static topological black holes when @xmath13 .",
    "we therefore use the following ansatz for the metric , in the usual schwarzschild - like co - ordinates : @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the line element of an @xmath16-dimensional space @xmath17 with constant curvature .",
    "the discrete parameter @xmath18 takes the values @xmath19 , for which we have the following forms of the function @xmath20 : @xmath21 the value @xmath22 gives the usual spherically symmetric metric , with the hypersurface @xmath23 equal to an @xmath16-sphere ; when @xmath24 , the hypersurface @xmath25 has constant negative curvature , and when @xmath26 , the hypersurface @xmath27 is an @xmath16-dimensional euclidean space ( see @xcite for further details ) .",
    "it is convenient to introduce a new metric function @xmath28 by @xmath29    with the ansatz ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) , and assuming that the scalar field @xmath30 depends only on the radial co - ordinate @xmath31 , the field equations ( [ eq : einst ] , [ eq : scalarfieldeq ] ) take the form : @xmath32 - \\left(2\\xi-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)h\\phi'^2+\\xi \\phi \\phi'(h'+2h \\delta ' ) -2\\xi \\phi\\nabla^2 \\phi + \\lambda ; \\nonumber \\\\ 0 & = & \\frac{n-2}{r}(1-\\xi\\phi^2)\\delta'-(1 - 2\\xi)\\phi'^2 - 2\\xi\\phi(\\delta'\\phi'-\\phi '' ) ; \\nonumber \\\\ 0 & = & h \\phi''+\\phi'\\left(h\\delta'+h'+h\\frac{n-2}{r}\\right ) -\\xi r \\phi .",
