    "long - range interactions between charged surfaces substantially influence the structural properties of soft materials , such as lipid membranes and colloidal suspensions @xcite . the nature of the long - range interaction between two charged surfaces immersed in an ionic solution is mainly determined by electrostatic interactions , mediated by the ionic solutes and polar solvent . when modeling the electrostatic interaction , surfaces are usually assumed to be homogeneously charged  @xcite .",
    "however , most charged surfaces in soft matter are heterogeneous over a certain length scale .",
    "a schematic drawing of two such heterogeneously charged surfaces is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] .",
    "while the interaction between two homogeneous surfaces depends on the average surface charge and the inter - surface separation , the interaction between two heterogeneous surfaces depends on the intra- and inter - surface charge correlations as well .",
    "several experimental studies @xcite measured inter - surface forces for different configurations of surface charge heterogeneities . for example , it was demonstrated @xcite that coating a negatively charged mica surface with a cationic surfactant monolayer may lead to the formation of positively charged bilayer patches , which neutralize the negative patches of the bare mica . a long - range attractive force was measured @xcite between two such coated mica surfaces . in another setup , it was found that adsorption of positive polyelectrolytes on negatively - charged spherical beads can lead to charge inversion of the beads @xcite .",
    "the adsorbed polyelectrolyte forms positively charge domains , while patches of bare regions on the beads remain negatively charged .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that by controlling the amount of adsorbed polyelectrolyte , overall neutral particles with a patchy heterogeneous charge distribution can be prepared . in this special case of neutral beads , the inter - particle interaction is attractive , while for smaller or larger amount of adsorbed polyelectrolyte ( where the average bead charge is , respectively , negative or positive ) the interaction is repulsive .",
    "the interaction between two _ periodically ordered _",
    "charged surfaces has been studied theoretically in several works @xcite within the framework of the linearized poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) equation . for non - neutral surfaces ,",
    "the leading interaction term depends on the average charge . for neutral surfaces , where the average charge is zero",
    ", the interaction depends strongly on the relative phase between the two charge distributions , and can vary from being repulsive to attractive . for two surfaces with identical average charge and small amplitude charge modulation",
    "it was shown , in the non - linear regime , that the repulsive interaction is weaker than the repulsion between two uniformly charged surfaces with the same average charge  @xcite .",
    "however , for non - zero average charge , the charge modulation leads only to a small correction , as compared to the leading interaction term determined by the average charge .     and @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "the inter - surface separation is @xmath1.[fig : schematic ] ]    in a more general case of experimental relevance the surface charges are distributed _ randomly _ ( and not periodically ) .",
    "we further make the important distinction between quenched and annealed cases of surface charge disorder . in the _ annealed _ case ,",
    "the surface charges are in thermodynamic equilibrium with other system variables , such as inter - surface separation , temperature and concentration of other species .",
    "the attraction can then be caused by self - adjusting of surface charge domains , where positively charge patches on one surface position themselves against negatively charge patches on the second surface and vice versa @xcite .",
    "for this case to hold , the typical time - scale of patch rearrangement must be substantially shorter than the measurement time - scale , such that the self - adjustment ( annealing ) of charged domains on the surfaces has enough time to be completed .    in the _ quenched _ case , the surface charges are frozen and independent of other system variables . for a quenched distribution of surface charges with no inter- and intra - surface correlations",
    ", it was reported that such heterogeneities have no effect on the two - surface interaction at the mean - field level @xcite , and the interaction depends solely on the average surface charge .",

    "when the top surface mode is identical with the bottom one , the interaction can vary between pure attraction and pure repulsion as function of the relative phase @xmath85 between the two surfaces . for an out - of - phase distribution , @xmath221 , there is a relative displacement by half a wavelength between the bottom and top surfaces , and the interaction is purely attractive , while for the in - phase case , @xmath70 , it is purely repulsive .",
    "these two limits are a consequence of strong inter - surface correlations . for intermediate values of the relative phase @xmath85 ,",
    "the correlation is weaker and a crossover from attraction ( at large separations ) to repulsion ( at small separations ) occurs at a separation @xmath222 .",
    "note that the crossover separation @xmath223 does not depend on the modulation amplitude . in the more general case where the bottom and top surfaces have different ( single ) @xmath215-mode ,",
    "the interaction is found to be purely repulsive .",
    "the origin of the repulsion in this case is due to the confinement of the counter - ions in between the surfaces .",
    "the role of the domain size in a general periodic ( multi - mode ) distribution is also investigated .",
    "it is found that the contribution due to periodic charge modulation is important only in the limit of large domains @xmath224 . for sufficiently large domains",
    "the contribution due to charge heterogeneity is substantial , even in the case of non - neutral surfaces , where the main contribution stems from the average surface charge .    the time - dependent relative displacement case discussed in sec .",
    "iii.c is motivated by recent surface force experiment @xcite , which examined whether the charge heterogeneity on the two surfaces is annealed or randomly distributed ( quenched case ) . in the experiments ,",
    "the normal forces between two mica surfaces partially coated with a cationic lipid bilayer were measured , while during the vertical approach the surfaces were also sheared laterally in an oscillatory mode at a rate which is slower than the typical time required for the ions in solution to rearrange , but faster than the time scale of vertical approach or lipids rearrangement on the coated surfaces .",
    "thus , it is assumed that the initial ordering of the surface charge on each surface is preserved during the normal approach .",
    "if the hypothesis that the surfaces are periodically ordered @xcite is correct , then the measured inter - surface force should depend on the average and mean square amplitude of the lateral motion as in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lateral_1])-([eq : lateral_2 ] ) . however , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the forces measured for different lateral motions remained unchanged , suggesting that the surface charge distribution is not periodic , but presumably is quenched and random .    while in the annealed case the surface charges can rearrange themselves , and the system approaches the minimum energy state as was investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite , in the quenched case the accessible configurations of the surfaces are frozen .",
    "the quenched probability distribution is usually determined by the experimental setup . for example , in surface force experiments the two surfaces are prepared separately before the force measurement , and their corresponding charge distributions can be assumed to be independent with no inter - surface correlation .",
    "we consider this case and find that the interaction is purely repulsive in the linear pb model , due to the vanishing of inter - surface bilinear coupling terms .",
    "the inter - surface interaction can be thought of as an average over equal weights of repulsive and attractive contributions .",
    "however , since the repulsive term varies as @xmath225 and the attractive one as @xmath226 , the repulsive contribution is always larger than the attractive one , leading to an overall repulsive interaction between uncorrelated randomly charged surfaces in the linear pb model .",
    "we discuss two specific types of random distributions . for gaussian charge distributions with no inter- and intra - surface correlations ,",
    "the interaction depends on a molecular length scale @xmath194 ( lower cutoff length ) .",
    "disorder at the molecular level may emerge due to local processes that are not affected by neighboring surface charges .",
    "the contribution of the heterogeneity in this case is negligible , in agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite .    in a more general case of lorentzian distribution with correlation length @xmath205",
    ", we find two limiting regimes . for large values of @xmath205 we obtain a substantial effect due to charge disorder , while for small values of @xmath205 the limit of disorder at the molecular level is recovered and the contribution due to disorder is negligible .",
    "note the similarity between these two limiting regimes and the case of periodic distributions mentioned earlier .",
    "for the latter and in the limit of large domains , @xmath227 , the effect is significant , while in the small domain limit , @xmath228 , the domain - size effect is quite negligible .",
    "all the results obtained in the present work assumed a linear pb regime and demonstrate that quenched charge disorder leads ( except in special set - ups ) to a non - vanishing repulsive interaction between charged surfaces .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that similar considerations can be extended to the non - linear pb regime , where the electrostatic potential is too large for the linear approximation to be valid .",
    "however , using a simplified model for the limit of infinitely - large charge domains , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the inter - surface interaction in the non - linear regime may become overall attractive .    in the appendix",
    "we reproduce this simplified treatment and compare its results , for a range of surface charge densities , with those of the linear model presented above . for weakly charged surfaces ,",
    "when the validity of the linear pb approximation can be justified , the overall repulsion predicted in the linear regime agrees with the non - linear one , while for strongly charged surfaces the linear pb equation fails to predict the attraction obtained in the non - linear regime .",
    "this suggests a possible crossover from repulsive to attractive inter - surface interaction , as a function of charge density and patch size .",
    "the results presented in our work demonstrate that charge heterogeneity may have important implications on the inter - surface interaction both for periodically modulated surfaces and randomly quenched ones .",
    "several extensions to our work can be considered .",
    "an effect not taken into account in the present work and left for future investigations is to look more carefully at the structure and thickness of the charged surface .",
    "this may be of importance for charged membranes composed of mixtures of charged and neutral lipids .",
    "as the lateral membrane charge density may be correlated with structural undulations and variation of membrane thickness , the inter - surface interaction between two membranes might be affected .",
    "a further remark should be made on the divergence of the free energy at small separations .",
    "this is related to our simplifying assumption on the boundary conditions , eq .",
    "( [ eq : bc_2 ] ) , in which the electrostatic field is confined in between the surfaces , and does not leak to the outer region .",
    "namely , the electrostatic field in the outward direction of the surface is set to zero .",
    "this assumption is reasonable when the dielectric constant of the outer region is much lower than the one of the ionic solution .",
    "however , for sufficiently small inter - surface separations , one might need to consider the leakage of the field to the outer region @xcite .",
    "since the attraction in the non - linear regime was predicted only in the limit of infinitely - large surface patches @xcite , it is worthwhile to investigate further the non - linear pb model",
    ". it will be of interest to study the origin of the attraction and relate it to the difference between the scaling of the counter - ion entropy for counter - ion release ( attraction ) versus counter - ion confinement ( repulsion ) .",
    "another possible extension would be to find a suitable approximation for the non - linear pb regime in three dimensions with heterogeneous boundary conditions .",
    "using such an approximation may shed more light on the interaction between randomly charged surfaces within the pb theory , and related experiments .",
