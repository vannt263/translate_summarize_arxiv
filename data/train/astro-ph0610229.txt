    "the prevalence of black holes in present day galaxy bulges , and the proportionality between black hole and spheroid mass @xcite implies that the formation of the two components are intimately linked .",
    "one way to probe star formation in distant qsos is to observe them at submm wavelengths , and so measure the amount of radiation from young stars which is absorbed and re - emitted by dust . with this in mind , we observed matched samples of x - ray absorbed and unabsorbed qsos at 850@xmath1 m with scuba .",
    "these observations revealed a remarkable dichotomy in the submm properties of these two groups of sources : almost all of the x - ray absorbed qsos at @xmath2 are ultraluminous infrared galaxies , while the x - ray unabsorbed qsos are not .",
    "this suggests that the two types are linked by an evolutionary sequence , whereby the qso emerges at the end of the main star - forming phase of a massive galaxy @xcite .",
    "however , the nature of the x - ray absorption remains puzzling .",
    "these objects are characterised by hard , absorbed x - ray spectra , and assuming that this is due to photoelectric absorption from cold material with solar abundances , their column densities are @xmath3  @xmath4 . on the other hand",
    ", they have optical / uv spectra which are typical for qsos , with broad emission lines and blue continua . for a galactic gas / dust ratio",
    ", the restframe uv spectra would be heavily attenuated by such large columns of material , so the absorber appears to contain very little dust .",
    "the x - ray absorption could be due to gas located within the agn structure , or from more distant material in the host galaxy , but in either case the lack of dust is suprising .",
    "if the absorber were associated with the obscuring dusty torus invoked in unification schemes @xcite we would expect significant dust attenuation , while the detection of the dust continuum at long wavelengths implies that the interstellar media of the host galaxies also have a high dust content .",
    "therefore , in order to investigate the x - ray absorption , we have obtained deep ( 50100ks ) _ xmm - newton _ observations of three submm bright , x - ray absorbed qsos from our sample of hard - spectrum _ rosat _ sources @xcite .",
    "as a starting point , we fitted the _",
    "xmm - newton _ spectra with a power law and fixed galactic absorption .",
    "the best fit photon indices are unusually hard for qsos : the qsos have @xmath5 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : threeqsos ] ) compared to the @xmath6 that is typical for x - ray selected qsos ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , although the fits have acceptable @xmath7 , the data show a systematic deficit of counts relative to the model at the softest energies , indicating that absorption is present .",
    "the original _ rosat _ pspc spectra and the _ xmm - newton _ spectra show excellent agreement ( see fig . [",
    "fig : threeqsos ] ) .",
    "the hypothesis of a normal ( @xmath8 ) agn x - ray spectrum and a cold absorber is strongly rejected for rxj121803 and rxj124913 .",
    "therefore we considered ionised absorber models for the x - ray absorption , using the ` xabs ' model in spex , which includes both photoelectric and line absorption .",
    "for all three agn an acceptable fit can be obtained with a @xmath8 power law and an absorber with an ionisation parameter log  @xmath9 and column densities of @xmath10@xmath11  @xmath4 .",
    "these absorbers have similar properties to the high - ionisation absorber phases seen as outflows in some nearby seyfert 1 galaxies and qsos such as ngc3783 and pg1114 + 445 @xcite .    at these ionisation parameters and column densities ,",
    "the absorbers are likely to originate in the agn themselves , rather than in the host galaxies .",
    "the detection of blue - shifted absorption lines in the rest - frame uv spectra of several of our x - ray absorbed qsos @xcite provides further evidence that the ionised absorbers originate in outflows from the qso .",
    "this solution is attractive , because it is compatible with the lack of optical extinction in these objects : if the absorber is driven as a wind , either from the accretion disc or from evaporation of the inner edge of the molecular torus , then dust will be sublimated before ( or as ) it enters the flow .",
    "identifying the x - ray absorption with an ionised wind also reconciles the properties of the x - ray absorbed qsos with geometric unification models , because the submm detection statistics imply that the x - ray absorption in these objects is not due to their orientation with respect to the dusty torus .",
    "instead , the detection of an ionised wind in absorption implies that these objects , like optical or x - ray selected qsos in general , are observed pole - on rather than edge - on with respect to the torus .",
    "as discussed by @xcite and @xcite , the low space density of x - ray absorbed qsos relative to unabsorbed qsos and to distant ultraluminous galaxies detected in blank field scuba surveys , implies that x - ray absorbed qsos are caught during a short - lived transitional phase . before this brief phase ,",
    "the agn must be weak and heavily obscured , as found by @xcite ; after this phase the host galaxy is essentially fully formed , and the naked qso shines brightly until its fuel is consumed .",
    "the origin of the x - ray absorption , and the brief duration of the transitional phase were open questions from these studies .",
    "in @xcite and @xcite we suggested that the transition is mediated by a wind from the qso , which terminates the star formation in the host galaxy by driving gas and dust into the intergalactic medium .",
    "such a scenario has also been proposed on theoretical grounds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the epic spectra of our x - ray absorbed qsos suggest that the absorbers are ionised winds driven by the agn , and therefore that the transition between buried agn and naked qso could indeed be mediated by a radiatively driven wind from the agn .",
