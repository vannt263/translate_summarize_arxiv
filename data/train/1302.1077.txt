    "last years electron transport in molecular transistors became a hot topic of experimental and theoretical investigations in nanoelectronics ( see e.g. @xcite ) . from experimental point of view",
    "it is a real challenge to place a single molecule in a gap between electric leads and to repeatedly measure electric current as a function of bias and gate voltages .",
    "being in a gap the molecule may form chemical bonds with one of metallic electrodes and then a considerable charge transfer from the electrode to the molecule takes place . in this case",
    "one can consider the trapped molecule as a part of metallic electrode and the corresponding device does not function as a single electron transistor ( set ) .",
    "much more interesting situation is the case when the trapped molecule is more or less isolated from the leads and preserves its electronic structure . in a stable state at zero gate voltage",
    "the molecule is electrically neutral and the chemical potential of the leads lies inside the gap between homo ( highest occupied molecular orbital ) and lumo ( lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ) states .",
    "this structure demonstrates coulomb blockade phenomenon @xcite and coulomb blockade oscillations of conductance as a function of gate voltage ( see review papers in @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in other words a molecule trapped in a potential well between the leads behaves as a quantum dot and the corresponding device exhibits the properties of set .",
    "the new features in a charge transport through molecular transistors as compared to the well - studied semiconducting set appear due to `` movable '' character of the molecule trapped in potential well ( the middle electrode of the molecular transistor ) .",
    "two qualitatively new effects were predicted for molecular transistors : ( i ) vibron - assisted electron tunnelling ( see e.g. @xcite ) and , ( ii ) electron shuttling @xcite ( see also review @xcite ) .",
    "vibron(phonon)-assisted electron tunnelling is induced by the interaction of charge density on the dot with local phonon modes ( vibrons ) which describe low - energy excitations of the molecule in a potential well .",
    "this interaction leads to satellite peaks ( side bands ) and unusual temperature dependence of peak conductance in resonant electron tunnelling @xcite . for strong electron - vibron interaction the exponential narrowing of level width and as a result strong suppression of electron transport ( polaronic blockade )",
    "was predicted @xcite .",
    "the effect of electron shuttling appears at finite bias voltages when additionally to electron - vibron interaction one takes into account coordinate dependence of electron tunnelling amplitude @xcite .",
    "recent years carbon nanotubes are considered as the most promising candidates for basic element of future nanoelectronics .",
    "both @xmath0-based and carbon nanotube - based molecular transistors were already realized in experiment @xcite .",
    "the low - energy features of i - v characteristics measured in experiment with @xmath0-based molecular transistor @xcite can be theoretically explained by the effects of vibron - assisted tunnelling @xcite .",
    "it is well known that in single - wall carbon nanotubes ( swnt ) electron - electron interaction is strong and the electron transport in swnt quantum wires is described by luttinger liquid theory .",
    "resonant electron tunnelling through a quantum dot weakly coupled to luttinger liquid leads for the first time was studied in ref.@xcite were a new temperature scaling of maximum conductance was predicted : @xmath1 with interaction dependent exponent ( g is the luttinger liquid correlation parameter ) .    in this paper",
    "we generalize the results of refs.@xcite to the case when a quantum dot with vibrational degrees of freedom is coupled to luttinger liquid quantum wires .",
    "the experimental realization of our model system could be , for instance , @xmath0-based molecular transistors with swnt quantum wires .    in our model",
    "electron - electron and electron - phonon interactions can be of arbitrary strength while electron tunnelling amplitudes are assumed to be small ( that is the vibrating quantum dot is weakly coupled to quantum wires ) .",
    "we will use master equation approach to evaluate the average current and noise power . for noninteracting electrons",
    "this approximation is valid for temperatures @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the bare level width . for interacting electrons the validity of this approach ( perturbation theory on @xmath3 ) for high - t regime of electron transport",
    "was proved for @xmath4 ( strong interaction ) @xcite and when @xmath5 ( weak interaction ) @xcite .",
    "we found that at low temperatures : @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is the characteristic energy of vibrons ) the peak conductance scales with temperature accordingly to furusaki prediction @xcite : @xmath8 ( @xmath9 is the luttinger liquid cutoff energy ) .",
    "the influence of electron - phonon interaction in low - t region results in renormalization of bare level width : @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the dimensionless constant of electron - phonon interaction . in the intermediate temperature region : @xmath12 , ( @xmath13 ) , furusaki scaling is changed to @xmath14 and at high temperatures when all inelastic channels for electron tunnelling are open we again recovered furusaki scaling with nonrenormalized level width ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "for nonlinear regime of electron tunnelling we showed that zero - bias peak in differential conductance , presenting elastic tunnelling , is suppressed by coulomb correlations in the leads .",
    "this is manifestation of the kane - fisher effect @xcite . when interaction is moderately strong ( @xmath15 ) the dependence of differential conductance on bias voltage is non - monotonous due to the presence of satellite peaks .",
    "for @xmath16 the zero - bias peak can be even more suppressed than the satellite peaks , which dominate in this case .",
    "this is the manifestation of the interplay between the luttinger liquid effects in the leads and the electron - phonon coupling in the dot . for strong interaction @xmath4 satellites",
    "are also suppressed and the differential conductance at low temperatures ( @xmath17 ) scales as @xmath18 .",
    "this scaling coincides with the furusaki prediction , where temperature is replaced by the driving voltage ( @xmath19 ) which becomes the relevant energy scale for @xmath20 .",
    "it means that the influence of vibrons on the resonant electron tunnelling through a vibrating quantum dot can be observed only for weak or medium strong interaction ( @xmath21 ) in the leads .",
    "the hamiltonian of our system ( vibrating quantum dot weakly coupled to luttinger liquid leads , ( see fig.1 ) consists of three parts @xmath22 here @xmath23 describes quantum wires adiabatically connected to electron reservoirs .",
    "quantum wires ( left - l and right - r ) are supposed equal and modelled by luttinger liquid hamiltonians with equal luttinger liquid parameters @xmath24 : @xmath25 ( see e.g.@xcite ) @xmath26 here @xmath27(@xmath28 ) are the creation ( annihilation ) operators of bosons which describe the charge density fluctuations propagating in the leads with velocity @xmath29 .",
    "these operators satisfy canonical bosonic commutation relations @xmath30=\\delta ( k - k')$ ] . in what follows",
    "we consider for simplicity the case of spinless electrons .",
    "the hamiltonian of vibrating single level quantum dot takes the form ( see e.g.@xcite ) @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the energy of electron level on the dot , @xmath7 is the energy of vibrons , @xmath33 is the electron - vibron interaction energy , @xmath34(@xmath35 ) and @xmath36(@xmath37 ) are fermionic ( @xmath35 ) and bosonic ( @xmath37 ) creation ( annihilation ) operators with canonical commutation relations @xmath38 , @xmath39=1 $ ] .",
    "the tunnelling hamiltonian is given by standard expression @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the electron tunnelling amplitude and @xmath42 , @xmath43 is the annihilation operator of electron at the end point of l(r)-electrode .",

    "all the energies are counted from the fermi energy , which chosen to be zero .",
    "electrons tunnel from one lead to another by hopping on and off the dot level with the energy @xmath56 ( elastic channel ) and due to electron - vibron coupling they can emit or absorb vibrons ( vibron - assisted tunnelling ) .",
    "inelastic channels are represented as side - levels with energies @xmath57 .",

    "the unitary transformation results in : ( i ) the shift of fermionic level ( polaronic shift ) @xmath64 and , ( ii ) the replacement of tunnelling amplitude in ( 3 ) @xmath65 .",
    "the model eqs.([1])-([5])can not be solved exactly and one needs to exploit certain approximations to go further .",
    "we will use `` master equation '' approximation ( see e.g. @xcite ) to evaluate the average current and noise power in our model .",
    "it is in this approximation that average current separately for the model with interacting leads @xcite and for vibrating quantum dot with noninteracting leads @xcite was calculated earlier .",
    "master ( rate ) equation approach exploits such quantities as the probability for electron to occupy dot level and the transition rates .",
    "it neglects quantum interference in electron tunnelling and therefore describes only the regime of sequential electron tunnelling which is valid when the width of electron level @xmath66 .",
    "in other words , in our case `` master equation '' approach is equivalent to the lowest order of perturbation theory in @xmath3 .    for interacting electrons the validity of master equation approach for high - t regime of resonant electron tunnelling can be justified for strong repulsive interaction @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "it is correct also for weak interaction @xmath5 as one can check by comparing the results of ref.@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite , where resonant tunnelling through a double - barrier luttinger liquid was considered for weak electron - electron interaction .",
    "notice , that the results @xcite of exact solution known for @xmath67 , where a mapping to free - fermion theory can be used @xcite , do not agree with the high - t scaling of @xmath68 @xcite extrapolated to this special point @xmath67 .",
    "the free - fermion scaling @xmath69 found for @xmath67 ( master equation approach predicts @xmath70-independent value @xcite ) could be a special feature of this exactly solvable case .",
    "we will assume that beyond the close vicinity to @xmath67 the master equation approach for high - t behavior of conductance is a reasonable approximation .",
    "in master equation approach the average current through a single level quantum dot expressed in terms of transition rates takes the form @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the rate of electron tunnelling from the dot to right ( left ) electrode , @xmath73 describes the reverse process and @xmath74 , @xmath75 @xmath76 . to evaluate these rates in our approach",
    "we will use fermi `` golden rule '' ( quantum mechanical perturbation theory ) for tunnelling hamiltonian obtained from eq.(4 ) after the unitary transformation : @xmath77 @xmath78 the standard calculation procedure results in the following expressions for tunnelling rates @xmath79 @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the bias voltage and @xmath43 .",
    "notice that in the perturbation calculation on the bare level width @xmath82 , we neglect the level width in the green function of the dot level .",
