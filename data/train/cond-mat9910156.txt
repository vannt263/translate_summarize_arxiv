    "the existence of a new basic phase in vehicle flow on multilane highways called the synchronized motion was recently discovered by kerner and rehborn @xcite , impacting significantly the physics of traffics as a whole . in particular , it turns out that the spontaneous formation of moving jams on highways proceeds mainly through a sequence of two transitions : `` free flow @xmath0 synchronized motion @xmath0 stop - and - go pattern '' @xcite . besides , all these transitions exhibit the hysteresis @xcite . as follows from the experimental data @xcite the synchronized mode is essentially a multilane effect .",
    "recently kerner @xcite assumed that the transition `` free flow @xmath0 synchronized mode '' is caused by `` z''-like form of the overtaking probability depending on the car density .",
    "there have been proposed several macroscopic models dealing with multilane traffic flow @xcite .",
    "both these models specify the traffic dynamics completely in terms of the car density @xmath1 , mean velocity @xmath2 , and , may be , the velocity variance @xmath3 or ascribe these quantities to the vehicle flow at each lane individually .",
    "nevertheless , a quantitative description of the synchronized mode is far from being developed well because of its complex structure @xcite . in particular",
    ", it can form the totally homogeneous ( _ i _ ) and homogeneous - in - speed ( _ ii _ ) flows @xcite . especially in the latter case there is no explicit relationship between the mean car velocity @xmath2 and density @xmath1 , with the value of @xmath2 being actually constant and less then that of free flow .",
    "the other important feature is the key role of some cars bunched together and traveling much faster than the typical ones , which enables to regard them as a special car group @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the synchronized mode the function of car distribution in the velocity space should have two maxima and we will call such fast car groups platoons in speed . these features of the synchronized mode have been substantiated also in @xcite using single - car - data . in particular , it has been demonstrated that the synchronized mode exhibits small correlations between fluctuations in the car flow , velocity and density .",
    "there is only a strong correlation between the velocities at different lanes taken at the same time and decreasing sufficiently fast as the time difference increases .",
    "by contrast , there are strong long - time correlations between the flow and density in the free flow state as well as the stop - and - go mode .    keeping in mind a certain analogy with aggregation processes in physical systems mahnke et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a kinetic model for the formation of the synchronized mode treated as the motion of a large car cluster . in the present paper following practically the spirit of the landau theory of phase transitions we develop a phenomenological approach to the description of this process .",
    "we ascribe to the vehicle flow an additional _ internal _ parameter will be called below the order parameter @xmath4 characterizing the possible correlations in the vehicle motion at different lanes and write for it a governing equation . for the car motion where drivers do not change lane",
    "at all we set @xmath5 , in the opposite limit @xmath6 .",
    "for fixed values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 the order parameter @xmath7 is assumed to be uniquely determined , thus , for a uniform vehicle flow we write : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the delay time and the function @xmath10 fulfills the inequality : @xmath11 we note that the time @xmath9 characterizes the delay in the driver decision of changing lanes but not in the control over the headway , so , this delay can be prolonged . the particular value @xmath12 of the order parameter results from the compromise between the danger of an accident during changing lanes and the will of driver to move as fast as possible .",
    "obviously , the lower is the mean vehicle velocity @xmath2 for a fixed value of @xmath1 , the weaker is the lane - changing danger and the stronger is the will to move faster .",
    "besides , the higher is the vehicle density @xmath13 for a fixed value of @xmath2 , the stronger is this danger ( here the will has no effect ) .",
    "thus , the dependence @xmath14 is an decreasing function of @xmath2 and @xmath13 , so , due to ( [ 2.2 ] ) : @xmath15 with the latter inequality being caused by the danger effect only .",
    "equation ( [ 2.1 ] ) describes actually the behavior of the drivers that prefer to move faster than the statistically mean vehicle and whose readiness for risk is greatest .",
    "exactly this group of drivers ( platoons in speed ) govern the value of @xmath7 .",
    "there is , however , another characteristics of the driver behavior , it is the mean velocity @xmath16 chosen by the _ statistically mean _ driver taking into account also the danger resulting from the frequent lane changes by the `` fast '' drivers .",
    "following typical assumptions the velocity @xmath17 as a function of @xmath1 is considered to be decreasing : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the upper limit vehicle density on road . in general",
    ", the dependence of @xmath20 on @xmath7 should be increasing for small values of the vehicle density , @xmath21 , because in this case the lane - changing makes no substantial danger to traffic and practically all the drives can pass by vehicles moving at lower speed without risk .",
    "by contrast , when the vehicle density is sufficiently high , @xmath22 , the lane - changing is due to the car motion of the most `` impatient '' drivers whose behavior makes an additional danger to the main part of other drivers and the velocity @xmath17 has to decrease as the order parameter @xmath7 increases . for certain intermediate values of the vehicle density , @xmath23 , this dependence is to be weak as well as near the boundary points , so : @xmath24 then the governing equation ( [ 2.1 ] ) takes the form : @xmath25   \\label{2.4}\\ ] ] and the condition @xmath26 specifies the steady state dependence @xmath27 of the order parameter on the vehicle density .",
    "let us , now , study properties and stability of this steady state solution . from eq .",
    "( [ 2.4 ] ) we get @xmath28 as mentioned above , the value of @xmath29 is solely due to the danger during changing lanes , so this term can be ignored until the vehicle density @xmath13 becomes sufficiently high .",
    "thus , in a certain region @xmath30 the derivative @xmath31 by virtue of ( [ 2.3 ] ) and ( [ intro:3 ] ) and the function @xmath27 is increasing or decreasing for @xmath32 or @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "this statement follows directly from the relation @xmath34 .    for long - wave perturbations of the vehicle distribution on a highway the density @xmath13",
    "can be treated as a constant .",
    "so , according to the governing equation  ( [ 2.4 ] ) , the steady - state traffic flow is unstable if @xmath33 .",
    "due to ( [ 2.2 ] ) and ( [ 2.3a ] ) the first term in the expression for @xmath35 in ( [ 2.7 ] ) is dominant in the vicinity of the lines @xmath5 and @xmath6 , thus , in these regions the curve @xmath27 is increasing and the steady state traffic flow is stable .",
    "for @xmath36 the value @xmath37 , inequality  ( [ 2.3a ] ) , and , thereby , the region @xmath38 corresponds to the stable vehicle motion .",
    "however , for @xmath39 there can be an interval of the order parameter @xmath7 where the derivative @xmath40 changes the sign and the vehicle motion becomes unstable .",
    "therefore , as the car density @xmath1 grows causing the increase of the order parameter @xmath7 it can go into the instability region wherein @xmath41 . under these conditions",
    "the curve @xmath42 is to look like `` s '' ( fig .",
    "[ f6]a ) and its decreasing branch corresponds to the unstable vehicle flow .",
    "the lower increasing branch matches the free - flow state , whereas the upper one should be related to the synchronized phase because it is characterized by the order parameter coming to unity .",
    "-plane and the form of the curve @xmath42 displaying the dependence of the order parameter on the vehicle density . ]",
    "the obtained dependence @xmath42 actually describes the first order phase transition in the vehicle motion . indeed , when increasing the car density exceeds the value @xmath43 the free flow becomes absolutely unstable and the synchronized mode forms through a sharp jump in the order parameter . if , however , after that the car density decreases the synchronized mode will persist until the car density attains the value @xmath44 .",
    "it is a typical hysteresis and the region @xmath45 corresponds to the metastable phases of traffic flow .",
    "it should be noted that the stated approach to the description of the phase transition `` free flow @xmath0 synchronized mode '' is rather similar to the hypothesis by kerner @xcite about `` z''-like dependence of the overtaking probability on the car density that can cause this phase transition .",
    "let us , now , discuss a possible form of the fundamental diagram showing @xmath46 $ ] where , by definition , @xmath47=\\vartheta [ h(\\rho ) , \\rho ] $ ] .",
    "[ f7]a displays the dependence @xmath17 of the mean vehicle velocity on the density @xmath13 for the fixed limit values of the order parameter @xmath5 or 1 . for small values of @xmath13",
    "these curves practically coincide with each other .",
    "as the vehicle density @xmath13 grows and until it comes close to the critical value @xmath48 where the lane change danger becomes substantial , the velocity @xmath49 practically does not depend on @xmath13 .",
    "so at the point @xmath48 at which the curves @xmath49 and @xmath50 meet each other the former curve , @xmath49 , is to exhibit sufficiently sharp decrease in comparison with the latter one .",
    "therefore , on one hand , the function @xmath51 has to be decreasing for @xmath39 . on the other hand , at the point @xmath48 for @xmath52 the effect of the lane change danger is not extremely strong , it only makes the lane change ineffective , @xmath53 ( compare ( [ 2.3a ] ) ) .",
    "so it is reasonable to assume the function @xmath54 increasing neat the point @xmath48 . under the adopted assumptions the relative arrangement of the curves @xmath55 , @xmath56",
    "is demonstrated in fig .",

    "[ f7]c shows the fundamental diagram of traffic flow resulting from fig .",
    "[ f6 ] and fig .",
    "[ f7]b .    ) and the vehicle flux ( @xmath57 ) vs. the vehicle density for the limit values of the order parameter @xmath58 as well as the resulting fundamental diagram ( @xmath59 ) . ]",
    "the developed model predicts also the same type phase transition for large values of the order parameter .",
    "in fact , in an extremely dense traffic flow changing lanes is sufficiently dangerous and the function @xmath60 describing the driver behavior is to depend strongly on the vehicle density as @xmath61 .",
    "in addition , the vehicle motion becomes slow . under such conditions the former term in the expression for @xmath62 in ( [ 2.7 ] ) should be dominant and , so , @xmath63 and the stable vehicle motion corresponding to @xmath32 is characterized by the decreasing dependence of the order parameter @xmath27 on the vehicle density @xmath13 for @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , as the vehicle density @xmath13 increases the curve @xmath27 can again go into the instability region ( in the @xmath65-plane ) , which has to give rise to a jump from the synchronized mode to a jam .",
    "the latter matches small values of the order parameter @xmath7 ( fig .  [ f6]b ) , so , it should comprise the vehicle flows along different lane where lane changing is depressed , making them practically independent of one another .",
    "we have introduced an additional state variable of the traffic flow , the order parameter @xmath7 , that accounts for internal correlations in the vehicle motion caused by the lane changing .",
    "since such correlations are due to the `` many - body '' effects in the car interaction the order parameter is regarded as an independent state variable . keeping in mind general properties of the driver behavior",
    "we have written the governing equation for this variable .",
    "it turns out that in this way such characteristic properties of the traffic flow instability as the sequence of the phase transitions `` free flow @xmath0 synchronized motion @xmath0 jam '' can be described without additional assumptions .",
    "moreover , in this model both the phase transitions are of the first order and exhibits hysteresis . besides , the synchronized mode corresponds to highly correlated vehicle flows along different lanes , @xmath66 , whereas in the free flow and the jam these correlations are depressed , @xmath67 .",
    "so , the jam phase actually comprises mutually independent car flows along different lanes .",
