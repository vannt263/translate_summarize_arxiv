    "in the framework of ultracold atom physics , the experimental tunability of control parameters pertaining each model hamiltonian has provided a powerful tool to investigate situations of fundamental physical interest @xcite .",
    "one of the most intriguing features about ultracold atoms is the possibility to engineer a defect - free periodic potential , as opposed , for instance , to the typical framework of solid - state physics .",
    "however , on the one hand the interplay between disorder and interactions in bosonic systems has attracted much theoretical attention since the seminal work by fisher @xcite , and on the other several techniques such as laser speckle field @xcite , the superposition of different optical lattices with incommensurate lattice constants @xcite , have proven the experimental relevance of disordered systems of ultracold atoms .    in the present paper we will deal with the effect of disorder on the zero - temperature phase diagram of bosonic atoms loaded onto a 1d lattice whose properties can be described in terms of bose - hubbard hamiltonian . in particular ,",
    "we will focus on the case where the disorder affects the hopping term @xmath0 where @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) represents the creation ( destruction ) operator on site @xmath3 .",
    "the hamiltonian parameters @xmath4 , @xmath5 represent the two - body interaction and the ( random ) hopping amplitude between neighboring sites respectively .    in the recent past , many authors have approached the analysis of the disordered bh model with various techniques such as field - theoretic approaches @xcite , decoupling ( or gunzwiller ) mean - field approximations @xcite , quantum monte - carlo simulations @xcite , among many others , e.g. @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we employ a site - decoupling mean - field approximation ( sdmfa ) , which allows to capture all of the essential features of the phase diagram of the model .",
    "the phases of the zero - temperature phase diagram are determined through the calculation of two different observables : the condensate fraction , defined as the largest eigenvalue of the one - body density matrix and the superfluid fraction , defined as the system response to the coupling to an external field @xcite .    at zero temperature ,",
    "as already pointed out in @xcite for the on - site disordered bh model , we expect the presence of three phases : the mott - insulating ( mi ) phase , where both condensate fraction and superfluid fraction are zero , the superfluid phase , where both superfluid phase and condensate fraction are different from zero , and , finally , the bose - glass phase , which has zero superfluid fraction and finite condensate fraction , which represents a typical feature of disordered hopping systems .    in section [ sec : mf ]",
    ", we introduce the site decoupling mean - field approximation for the case given by hamiltonian and we depict the zero - temperature phase diagram , discussing similarities and differences between the random - hopping and the random on - site potential case .    in section [ sec :",
    "stab ] , we discuss the stability of the mott phase through the stability analysis of the recurrence map induced by the sdmfa . this analysis will be performed comparing the results obtained by numerical exact diagonalization and analytical results based on random - matrix theory .",
    "the sdmfa was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , and relies on the approximation @xmath6 where the @xmath7 s are mean - field variables to be determined self - consistently .",
    "the above posit turns the bh hamiltonian into a mean - field hamiltonian that is the sum of on - site contributions .",
    "@xmath8 where @xmath9 is the usual bosonic number operator and the disorder related to the hopping term has been embedded into the adjacency matrix @xmath10 . for nearest - neighbor hopping on a 1d system",
    "the adjacency matrix can be written as @xmath11 where @xmath12 takes into account a possible coupling to an external field ( _ peierls factors _ ) , @xmath13 accounts for a possible inhomogeneity of the hopping amplitude . here",
    "we consider a 1d lattice comprising @xmath14 sites with periodic boundary conditions , i.e. @xmath15    the ground state of hamiltonian ( [ e : mfh ] ) is clearly a product of on - site states , @xmath16    the decoupling mean - field approach has proved to provide satisfactory qualitative phase diagrams for homogeneous lattices @xcite and superlattices @xcite .      in the present section",
    "we report the results of the application of sdmfa to the zero - temperature phase diagram calculation .    for our calculations",
    "we have considered a lattice formed by 100 sites , with values of the adjacency matrix given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is an uncorrelated random variable uniformly distributed between @xmath19 and @xmath20 , with the constraint @xmath21 in order to preserve @xmath22 . in fig . [",
    "fig : hop ] , we have represented two explicit realizations of disorder taken into account for subsequent mean - field calculations of phase diagrams .",
    "[ fig : hop ]    the value of @xmath19 has been kept small enough to ensure reasonable self - averaging for the system under investigation .",
    "higher disorder amplitudes would require larger chains in order to obtain results independent of the specific disorder realization .",
    "the different phases have been identified through the evaluation of two observables , namely the _ condensate fraction _ , defined as the largest eigenvalue of the one - body density matrix @xmath23 and the _ superfluid fraction _ defined as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the ground - state energy corresponding to the presence of a peierls phase @xmath12 in the hopping term .",
    "the mi phase is characterized by @xmath26 , the superfluid phase ( sf ) by @xmath27 and @xmath28 , while the phase where @xmath29 and @xmath30 is recognized as the bose - glass ( bg ) phase @xcite .    in absence of disorder ,",
    "the variation of the control parameters  chemical potential and hopping amplitude always leads to a transition from a phase with both @xmath31 and @xmath32 equal to zero to a phase with @xmath31 and @xmath32 different from zero , excluding then the presence of a bose - glass phase .    on the other hand ,",
    "if on - site disorder is present , the mi phase is ( possibly ) separated from the sf phase by a bg phase .",
    "likewise , when disorder affects the hopping term alone a bg crops up , as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lobe ] .",
    "however the distribution of the bg phase in the parameter space is qualitatively different .",
    "for example , with on - site disorder mi and sf phase are separated by a bg phase as @xmath33 goes to zero , while with disorder on the hopping term the bg phase tends to disappear for small @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "this region of the phase diagram seems to be a good starting point for future investigations by means of a cluster mf approach @xcite , because it would reveal possible mi phases that are not detectable through the single - site mean - filed technique implemented in the present paper .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : lobe ] we have represented the first lobe of the zero temperature phase diagram as obtained by sdmfa for @xmath34 and @xmath35 .    [ fig : lobe ]",
    "in the present section we introduce a procedure to determine the border of the mi phase which is based on the stability of the self - consistency map induced by the mean - field procedure .    as a first consideration , it is possible to state that the condition @xmath36 for every @xmath37 corresponds to the gapped insulating phase of the mean - field hamiltonian [ e : mfh ] .",
    "indeed , in this case the local ground - states are eigenvectors of the local number operator @xmath38 @xmath39 denotes the smallest integer larger than @xmath40 , and hence the mean - field ground - state ( [ e : mfgs ] ) is a pure fock state . as for the ordered bose - hubbard hamiltonian ,",
    "the relevant on - site energy is @xmath41 hence @xmath42 at every site , and the self - consistency constraint is satisfied . in other terms @xmath43 is a fixed point of the map defined by eq . .",
    "the gapped insulating phase is stable as long as this fixed point is stable .",
    "this is true as long as the magnitude of the maximal eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath44 appearing in the linearized version of eq .",
    "is smaller than 1 , see . in order to determine @xmath44 ,",
    "we assume @xmath45 and consider the ( mean - field ) kinetic term in hamiltonian as perturbative .",
    "if first order perturbation theory is performed one gets @xmath46 where @xmath47 hence the linearized version of the self - consistency map eq .",
    "can be written as @xmath48 where the matrix @xmath44 is proportional to the adjacency matrix @xmath49 : @xmath50 recalling the criteria for the stability of linear maps , the fixed point @xmath51 ( equivalent to @xmath52 ) is stable whenever @xmath53 where @xmath54 the eigenvalue of @xmath44 with the largest magnitude .",
    "the problem of determining the maximal eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath44 can be reduced to the calculation of the maximal eigenvalue of the ( tridiagonal ) adjacency matrix @xmath49 .",
    "note that @xmath49 is basically the one - particle hamiltonian for a non - interacting off - diagonal anderson model ( random hopping model ) . if @xmath55 is the maximal eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix , eq . can be recast as    @xmath56    we have dealt with the calculation of the eigenvalues of @xmath49 both numerically and analytically .",
    "the analytical approach consists in the determination of the spectral density of the matrix , given the probability distribution of the elements of the matrix following the approach outlined by dyson for and harmonic - oscillator chain @xcite , while the former simply consists in the direct numerical evaluation of the matrix eigenvalues .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : lmax ] we report the maximum eigenvalue @xmath55 for the random adjacency matrix @xmath49 as a function of the strength of disorder for both a single realization and a disorder average over 1000 samples .",
    "the two panels refer to different lattice sizes . in every case",
    ", it is evident that the maximal eigenvalue @xmath55 grows with increasing disorder strength , @xmath19 .",
    "the stability condition given by eq .",
    ", along with the above considerations about the @xmath55-dependence from @xmath19 are in agreement with the considerations of section [ sec : num ] , as far as the mi phase is concerned .",
    "in particular @xmath55 can be thought of as a shrinking factor for the mi lobe when compared to a homogeneous situation .      in this section",
    "we would like to describe an analytical method to obtain the largest eigenvalue of a ( possibly infinite ) random adjacency matrix whose entries are given by eq . .",
    "for some particular disorder distributions it is possible to carry through the analytical calculation and , as a consequence , solve eq . without finite - size effects .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , in principle , the information gained through this approach is richer .",
    "in fact for some specific realizations of disorder it is possible to obtain the full integrated density of states @xmath57 and not simply the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix .",
    "the solution of the problem can be obtained following the approach proposed by dyson for the solution of a linear chain of harmonic oscillators .    here",
    "we will sketch dyson s approach , outlining the connection with our problem , providing the portion of @xmath57 needed to obtain the largest eigenvalue in view of eq . .    in @xcite , the problem of a linear harmonic chain with springs of random elastic",
    "is reformulated as a tridiagonal matrix diagonalization problem .",
    "the matrix @xmath44 has the following form @xmath58 which is related to the matrix @xmath49 defined in eq . by a unitary transformation @xmath59 @xmath60 with @xmath61 and @xmath62 and setting @xmath63 in eq . .",
    "the unitarity of @xmath59 allows to state that the eigenvalues of @xmath44 are equal to the eigenvalues of @xmath49 , hence the procedure followed in @xcite can be directly mapped onto our problem .",
    "the core of this approach resides in the definition of the characteristic function of the chain @xmath64 where @xmath14 is the size of the matrix , and @xmath65 the desired eigenvalues of the matrix under consideration .",
    "the density of states @xmath66 and the integrated density of states @xmath67 can be obtained from the characteristic function through the following relation @xmath68\\ ] ] having defined @xmath69    the determination of @xmath70 is obtained through a power series expansion @xmath71 the determination of @xmath72 leads to the following relation @xmath73\\ ] ] having defined @xmath74 through the continued fraction @xmath75 if , as it may be safely assumed in our case , the various values of @xmath76 are independent random variables with probability distribution @xmath77 , the variable @xmath78 will have probability distribution @xmath79 satisfying the following integral equation @xmath80\\frac{1+\\xi'}{x } d\\xi'.\\ ] ] with the normalization condition @xmath81 we obtain @xmath82    if we assume a poissonian form for @xmath77 @xmath83 eq . has an analytical solution . hence it is possible to obtain the integrated density of states in closed form in terms of integral functions .",
    "the integrated density of states for @xmath49 can be simply obtained back by posing @xmath84 since in @xcite @xmath57 is defined as the proportion of eigenvalues for which @xmath85 , while @xmath86 as the proportion of eigenvalues with @xmath87 . as a simple check ,",
    "we provide here the expression for @xmath88 , corresponding to the case without disorder , i.e. @xmath89 in eq . , @xmath90 & z<2 \\\\                   & = 1                                        & z>2 .",

    "[ fig : intd2 ] shows the behavior of the integrated density of states in the vicinity of the band edge at @xmath55 , for three different values of the disorder strength . in ref .",
    "@xcite the behavior of the corresponding density of states is related to the presence of a bg phase outside the mi region . in that case",
    "a possible direct transition from the mi to the sf phase is possible for small disorders and specific values of the chemical potential , and signaled by a singularity at the band edge in the density of states , similar to the van hove singularity characterizing the homogeneous case , eq . .",
    "conversely , in the present case , where density of states depends on the chemical potential through an overall multiplicative factor , an infinitesimal disorder is sufficient to smear the discontinuity in the density of states .",
    "hence an intermediate bg phase is expected for every value of the chemical potential , which is in agreement with the previously noted shape of the bg phase in figs .",

    "analogously to what happens when a random on - site term is considered , we have observed the emergence of a bose - glass phase .",
    "the analysis has been performed within a mean - field approach both numerically and analytically .",
    "the boundaries of the mott lobes and the presence of a surrounding bg phase has been related to the spectral feature of an off - diagonal anderson model . for the future",
