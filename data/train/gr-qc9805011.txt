    "in recent years , gravity in three dimensions has attracted much attention . since baados , teitelboim and zanelli ( btz ) found circularly - symmetric black hole solutions for three dimensional gravity with a negative cosmological constant  @xcite , properties of their black holes  @xcite and many other types of three dimensional black holes have been investigated .    on the other hand ,",
    "static black hole solutions including matter fields in @xmath1 dimensions have been examined by many authors .",
    "one of their examples is the yang - mills black hole in four dimensional spacetime  @xcite .",
    "its properties have been studied and some descendants have been considered recently  @xcite .    static black holes with a nontrivial scalar field as a source of gravity is , however , problematic in four dimensions .",
    "beckenstein established a no - go theorem for static spherical black holes with such `` scalar hair '' in @xmath1 dimensions  @xcite .",
    "again we turn to the three dimensional case .",
    "since btz used a negative cosmological constant and found the asymptotically no - flat black hole solution , we do not have to restrict ourselves to the positive definite scalar potentials .",
    "thus the no - go theorem of bekenstein will be evaded in the three dimensional case .",
    "actually , three - dimensional black hole slutions with scalar fields are studied in various contexts  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we considered a simple class of scalar potentials in three dimensional gravity and construct circularly - symmetric black hole solutions in the model . in three dimensions , rotating solutions",

    "the value of @xmath4 varies with the radial coordinate , while @xmath4 takes the constant value @xmath8 outside the boundary @xmath21 .",
    "then the field equation for @xmath22 is @xmath23 where @xmath24 . at the boundary @xmath25 , the interior and exterior solutons",
    "must be smoothly continued : thus @xmath26 at @xmath25 .    to solve the differential equations  ( [ eq : fe1]-[eq : fe10 ] ) ,",
    "one must find a suitable set of boudary conditions for a black hole solution .",

    "we have constructed circularly - symmetric black hole solutions with scalar hair in @xmath0 dimensions . in our model , ratios of physical quantities have dependence on the scaled cosmological constant @xmath53 , because of the simplicity of the scalar potential .",
    "this fact tells us that the complexity in the behavior of the physical quantities in the case of the yang - mills black holes in @xmath1 dimensions  @xcite is due to the non - linear nature of the self - interaction .",
    "although our model is very simple , we found the critical behavior with respect to @xmath53 .",
    "we have to study more closely this behavior and the structure of the spacetime when @xmath53 approaches the critical value @xmath84 .    for rotating black holes , we found some ratios of the physical quantities are independent of the angular momentum .",
    "the extreme condition seems the same as the one of the vacuum case , @xmath85 .",
    "studying the structure of the spacetime in the extreme case is of much interest .    analyzing",
    "the stability of our solution is , unfortunately , somewhat difficult because of the singular point in the potential .",
    "the general cases with `` smooth '' potentials must be investigated and the relation to the model of the unified field theory has to be clarified .",
