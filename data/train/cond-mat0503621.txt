    "liquid crystals are typically composed of highly anisotropic molecules .",
    "they are viscoelastic materials ; some of their properties are typical of a liquid while others are usually associated with solids . as liquids ,",
    "they can flow and they exhibit a viscous response to an applied stress .",
    "however , liquid crystals also possess long - range , orientational order @xcite which results from the entropic advantage of aligning the constituent molecules .",
    "the long - range , orientational order is usefully described by the director field @xmath2 , the coarse - grained , average , molecular orientation . in a cholesteric or chiral nematic liquid crystal @xmath2",
    "has a natural twist deformation along an axis perpendicular to the molecules @xcite .",
    "examples of cholesteric liquid crystals are dna molecules in solution , colloidal suspensions of bacteriophages@xcite , and solutions of nematic mixtures such as e7 with chiral dopants which are widely used in display devices .",
    "a particularly intriguing phase of liquid crystals is obtained by slowly cooling down a liquid crystal from the isotropic into the cholesteric phase . instead of a direct transition into a helical configuration ,",
    "it was found experimentally that the system passes through a series of first order phase transitions , all of which occur in a temperature range of roughly @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "these phases are known as blue phases .",
    "typically @xcite , experiments report a series of at least three phases intervening in this small temperature range .",
    "the series of transitions is often as follows : isotropic ( i ) @xmath4 blue phase iii ( bp iii ) @xmath4 blue phase ii ( bp ii ) @xmath4 blue phase i ( bp i ) @xmath4 cholesteric ( c ) .",
    "bp i and bp ii display a cubic symmetry , while bp iii has an amorphous nature .",
    "blue phases are now beginning to find applications in lasers @xcite and in electric field driven devices @xcite .",
    "blue phases provide a particularly fascinating example of liquid crystal ordering as they correspond to complicated director fields which , even in equilibrium , are threaded by a regular network of disclinations @xcite . identifying their structure",
    "presented a considerable theoretical challenge the resolution of which is clearly summarised in the review by wright and mermin @xcite .    in the literature attention",
    "has mainly focussed on four different candidates for the cubic blue phases .",
    "the nomenclature used here refers to the symmetry group which characterises the lattice of disclinations formed in the blue phases following @xcite .",
    "o@xmath5 has the symmetry of a simple cubic lattice , @xmath6 and o@xmath0 that of a body - centered - cubic lattice .",
    "the two o@xmath7 phases are candidates for bp i as they have the same octahedral symmetry , while o@xmath5 has been proposed as a model for bp ii . the defect structure in each phase in shown in figure 1 .",
    "in o@xmath5 and in o@xmath0 the defect lines merge in the center of the unit cell , whereas in the octahedral phases the defects avoid each other .",
    "the @xmath8 tensor theory , in which the local conformation of the liquid crystal is specified by a tensor , and not only by the director field @xmath9 , is the natural language to understand the equilibrium properties of blue phases because it is able to capture their inherent biaxiality @xcite . with the advent of more powerful computers",
    "it is now possible to numerically minimise the free energy for any value of the chirality @xmath10 without further approximation than that inherent in the free energy expression itself .",
    "this is the programme we follow in this paper .",
    "we determine the equilibrium phase diagram which specifies which of the cubic blue phases has the lowest free energy as a function of the system parameters .",
    "we find a phase diagram qualitatively similar to that found in earlier work and compatible with the assignments bp i = o@xmath1 and bp ii = o@xmath5 .",
    "however there are quantitative differences .",
    "in particular the results show that the triple point between the cholesteric and blue phases is lowered in chirality by around 20 % .",
    "we also show that the region of stability of o@xmath0 shrinks and that of o@xmath1 increases with respect to the previous estimates .",
    "the revised phase diagram is more compatible with observations suggesting that the landau - de gennes theory is sufficient to explain the static observations on blue phases .",
    "finally , we characterise the approach to equilibrium and in particular we describe the dynamic pathway by which the disclination structure of o@xmath1 assembles in the simulations .",
    "the equilibrium properties of the liquid crystal are described by a landau - de gennes free energy density expanded in terms of a tensor order parameter @xmath8 .",
    "this is related to the direction of individual molecules , @xmath11 , by @xmath12 where the angular brackets denote a coarse - grained average and the greek indices label the cartesian components of @xmath8 .",
    "the tensor @xmath8 is traceless and symmetric .",
    "its largest eigenvalue , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , describes the magnitude of the order .",
    "the free energy comprises a bulk term @xmath15 ( summation over repeated indices is implied hereafter in our notation ) @xmath16 and a distortion term , @xmath17 which for cholesterics is @xcite @xmath18\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is an elastic constant and @xmath20 , with @xmath21 the pitch of the cholesteric liquid crystal .",
    "the tensor @xmath22 is the levi - civita antisymmetric third - rank tensor , @xmath23 is a constant and @xmath24 controls the magnitude of the order ( physically it corresponds to an effective temperature or concentration for thermotropic and lyotropic liquid crystal respectively ) .",
    "this free energy has the same functional form of the one employed in refs .",
    "@xcite , but the latter is more general as it contains one more parameter in the bulk free energy density term",
    ".    of particular interest for the present discussion of blue phase equilibrium @xcite are two quantities , the chirality @xmath10 , and the reduced temperature @xmath25 .",
    "these are defined in ref .",
    "@xcite and in our formulation they can be found via : @xmath26    approaches to study the equilibrium properties of blue phases which have given a great deal of insight into the phase behaviour have so far been based on an expansion in the parameter @xmath10 . _",
    "high chirality _ theories are strictly valid for infinite @xmath10 . in that case",
    "an infinite number of exact minimizers of the free energy density can be found as an arbitrary sum of biaxial helices @xcite .",
    "_ low chirality _ theories have also been formulated .",
    "these rely on the frank free energy defined in terms of the coarse grained director field @xmath2 instead of @xmath8 : this is equivalent to assuming a uniaxial order parameter .    in this work",
    "we do not make assumptions about the value of @xmath10 but rather minimise the landau - de gennes free energy by numerically solving an equation of motion for * q * @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a collective rotational diffusion constant .",
    "the term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ qevolution ] ) describes the relaxation of the order parameter towards the minimum of the free energy .",
    "the molecular field @xmath29 which provides the driving force is related to the derivative of the free energy @xmath30 by @xmath31 where tr denotes the tensorial trace . from eqs .",
    "( [ eqbulkfree ] ) and ( [ eqdistfree ] ) , the molecular field is explicitly @xmath32",
    "our aim in this work is to numerically minimise  by solving eq .",
    "( [ qevolution ] ) using a lattice boltzmann algorithm  the free energies of the cubic blue phases @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 . in this section",
    "we report the procedure used .",
    "the equilibrium state for chosen values of chirality @xmath10 and reduced temperature @xmath25 was obtained as the steady state solution of the equation of motion ( [ qevolution ] ) .",
    "the initial condition for each phase was taken as its configuration for infinite chirality ( @xmath37 or @xmath38 ) for which exact analytical expressions are available @xcite . in the @xmath37",
    "limit the @xmath8 tensors characterising the blue phases retain the correct topology of the disclination lines . as expected this",
    "was preserved under the dynamics allowing us to minimise the free energy for a structure with the chosen network of disclinations for any value of @xmath25 and @xmath10 .    for completeness",
    "we report here the initial configurations chosen in this work .",
    "( note that in all cases the components @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are obtained by cyclic permutation from those given below . )",
    "the initial configuration for o@xmath5 is @xmath43 where @xmath44 is an arbitrary amplitude .",
    "that for @xmath34 is @xmath45 where @xmath44 .",
    "those for @xmath6 are @xmath46 where @xmath47 is positive for @xmath35 and negative for @xmath36 .",
    "in general , the minimum free energy for blue phases is not attained when the periodicity of the disclination lattice matches the pitch of the cholesteric helix @xmath21 but when the unit cell is larger .",
    "this is accounted for by considering alternative initial conditions with @xmath48 substituted by @xmath49 @xcite , with @xmath50 . since the lattice periodicity is bigger than that for the infinite chirality solutions , @xmath51 is referred to as a ` redshift ' .",
    "we checked the validity of the values of @xmath51 suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite and then used them to build the initial conditions . if redshift is not accounted for , the region of stability of blue phases does not change significantly , but the o@xmath1 phase is not found .",
    "details of the lattice boltzmann algorithm used to solve the equation of motion are given in refs .",
    "calculations were performed on a parallel machine , for a 32x32x32 cubic lattice .",
    "this means that , for example , in the case of @xmath33 a cholesteric pitch was discretized into 64 lattice points . typically , the simulation of one point in the phase space @xmath52 ran on eight processors and required @xmath53 hours of computational time .",
    "periodic boundary conditions were used throughout . to ensure that equilibrium was reached",
    ", we required that the variation in the free energy after 200 iterations of eq .",
    "( [ qevolution ] ) was smaller than @xmath54 before ending the run .",
    "a convenient value of @xmath28 , ensuring numerical stability and fast computation time , was @xmath55 .",
    "the parameters defining the free energy were chosen to match typical values for cholesterics . in",
    "what follows the points on the phase diagram will be labelled by their @xmath52 ( as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) or @xmath56 values .",
    "these can be related straightforwardly via the transformation in eq .",
    "( [ transformation ] ) .",
    "in this section we report the results obtained for the defect structure of the blue phases , and the equilibrium phase diagram in the vicinity of the isotropic - cholesteric transition .",
    "we also consider the dynamics of the defect lines as equilibrium is approached .      as a first check ,",
    "we compute the defect structure associated with the cubic blue phases after equilibration .",
    "we choose @xmath57 and @xmath58 , while the elastic constant @xmath59 for @xmath33 , and @xmath60 for @xmath34 and @xmath6 .",
    "these correspond to a chirality @xmath61 and a reduced temperature @xmath62 .",
    "the resulting disclination line networks are shown in fig .",
    "[ defect_structure ] .",
    "the tubes in the figure represent regions of the blue phase unit cell in which the order parameter drops below some specified threshold , i.e. they represent disclination lines .",
    "the thickness of the tubes is related to the width of the defect cores .",
    "these structures are in good agreement with those obtained in refs .",
    "we note that the structure of the defects depends on the parameters .",
    "if @xmath23 or @xmath24 are increased , i.e. if @xmath10 decreases , then the width of the disclinations decreases and the drop in order parameter at the defect cores becomes shallower .",
    "we also checked the three - dimensional director field profile and found the presence of distinct regions of double twist separated by the defects shown in fig .",
    "[ defect_structure ] , in qualitative agreement with the usual theoretical picture of blue phases  @xcite .",
    "next we report results for the free energy of the equilibrated blue phases . in fig .",
    "[ free_energy_plots ] we show free energy curves for o@xmath5 , o@xmath0 , o@xmath63 , o@xmath1 and the isotropic and cholesteric phases for @xmath57 and variable @xmath24 .",
    "it can be seen that blue phases appear near the transition to the isotropic phase . as @xmath23 increases , the region of stability of blue phases shrinks .",
    "this is in agreement with previous experimental and analytical results in the literature @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ phase_diagram ] , we show the phase diagram in the @xmath52 plane which identifies for every point which of the phases , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath6 , cholesteric or isotropic , has the minimum free energy . for comparison",
    "we show , in the same plane , the phase diagram obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite which employed a fourier expansion of the tensor order parameter @xmath8 around the @xmath37 limit .",
    "we stress that the main difference is that in our case we relax the structures ( with the disclination network topology suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite ) by dynamically solving eq . ( [ qevolution ] ) .",
    "so the configurations used to construct our phase diagram are actual ( in general local ) minima of the landau - de gennes free energy . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the configurations found correspond to the free energy minima within a restricted phase space in which the @xmath8 tensor expression is constrained to be a sum of spherical harmonics of order @xmath64 with variable coefficients .",
    "overall , we find qualitative agreement in that ( a ) the stable phases found ( for the parameters investigated here ) are o@xmath5 , o@xmath0 and o@xmath1 , ( b ) o@xmath0 appears for high chirality only , and ( c ) the phase diagram is consistent with the assignment of bp i as o@xmath1 and of bp ii as o@xmath5 proposed in @xcite .",
    "however , a few relevant differences should be stressed .",
    "first , the region of stability of o@xmath0 is shifted to unphysically high values of the chirality @xmath65 .",
    "( values of @xmath66 are found in cholesterics . )",
    "this result is consistent with the observations , which ruled out structures of o@xmath0 symmetry from the known blue phases .",
    "the region of stability of o@xmath1 expands and reaches lower chirality values . the critical point below which blue phases are no longer stable",
    "is also shifted from @xmath67 to below @xmath68 ( deeper into the experimentally accessible region ) .",
    "pleasingly , this leads to the correct order of appearance of bp i and bp ii as the chirality is increased ( as found in the experiments ) .",
    "this was not achieved before within the landau - de gennes framework .    to construct the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ phase_diagram ] , we used the values of the redshift from ref .",
    "@xcite , which were obtained within the approximate framework detailed above .",
    "as a check , for a few points in the phase diagram , we equilibrated systems with different redshifts .",
    "plots of free energy versus redshifts for two points in the phase diagram are shown in fig .",
    "[ redshift ] .",
    "at all points we tested we found that the redshift values in ref .",
    "@xcite corresponded very closely to the free energy minimum . in this way",
    "we feel confident that an extensive calculation taking into account all possible redshifts for all data points , which is numerically extremely expensive , would give a quantitatively very similar phase diagram .",
    "the discrepancy between the phase diagram obtained here and the one given in ref .",
    "@xcite show that high order fourier components of @xmath8 are important at least in some regions of the phase diagram . indeed the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite noted that in a large part of the region where the phase diagrams differ the energies of the various phases are very close . thus considering a larger variational space",
    "could well change the phase boundaries .",
    "it is interesting to consider the dynamics of the approach to equilibrium of the blue phases from the infinite chirality initial states .",
    "the o@xmath5 and o@xmath1 structures are initially quite far from their equilibrium configurations , while the o@xmath0 and o@xmath63 configurations are closer .",
    "this means that the free energy for o@xmath0 is lower than that of o@xmath5 or o@xmath1 at the beginning of the simulations . during equilibration , the finite chirality deforms the tensor configurations of o@xmath5 and o@xmath1 via a process which can be suggestively compared to the acquisition of an infinite number of harmonics in the language of @xcite and the curves eventually cross .",
    "the approach to equilibrium of the free energy was in all cases found to be well represented by an exponential decay to the equilibrated value , with the decay rate playing the role of a relaxation time .",
    "since the transitions are all ( weakly ) first order this is as expected on general grounds .",
    "the most interesting dynamics of approach to equilibrium is that of @xmath69 . in this case",
    "the initial structure does not closely resemble the equilibrium structure ( see fig .",
    "[ dynamicso8- ] ) .",
    "in particular the disclination line along the axis @xmath70 $ ] is only partially present . during equilibration , it assembles by the formation of isolated local defects aligned along @xmath70 $ ] which then merge into a disclination line .",
    "the dynamical evolution was found to be almost independent of the values of @xmath71 and @xmath24 studied .",
    "it would be interesting to follow the evolution of the disclination line experimentally to see whether this effect can be realistic .",
    "calculations are currently underway to check if the same pathway is followed when the full hydrodynamic equations of motion of the liquid crystal are solved .",
    "in conclusion , we have numerically minimised the landau - de gennes free energy of a cholesteric liquid crystal and identified the region of stability of the blue phases .",
    "it was possible to obtain results for any values of the chirality @xmath10 , that is , for any degree of biaxiality of the tensor order parameter .",
    "our results qualitatively confirm those obtained previously using expansions for large or small @xmath10 .",
    "however there are quantitative differences ; in particular the blue phases first appear at a value of @xmath10 @xmath72 20% smaller than in the approximate minimisations . also , it is interesting to note that the full numerical solution presented here produces for the first time the correct order of appearance of bp i and bp ii at low chiralities , while the o@xmath0 phase , which was not observed in experiments , is relegated to unphysical values of the chirality .",
    "we finally followed the approach to equilibrium . in the case of",
    "o@xmath1 the disclination network assembles during the equilibration via an intermediate state in which aligned isolated defects appear and then join to form the disclination line along the cube lattice diagonal .",
    "note that in two rather recent papers @xcite , it was found that adding fluctuations to the landau - de gennes free energy could render the phase diagram more realistic in that e.g. the region of stability of o@xmath0 was restricted .",
    "here we find a similar result by an exact minimisation of the mean field free energy without including fluctuations .",
    "finally , our approach can be generalised to study the effect of an electric field on the phase diagram as well as the dynamics of the switching of a blue phase device , such as the one proposed in ref .",
