    "when you roll up your sleeves to get some work done , you will not pay attention to the intricate folding patterns which form around your arms .",
    "however , these patterns are not only interesting for graphics designers but of eminent importance for biology and technology alike @xcite : one can find them in the twinkling of an eye @xcite as well as in the development of organs such as the brain @xcite , the intestine @xcite , or the kidney @xcite .",
    "technological applications include structures for optics @xcite or microfluidics @xcite to name just a few .",
    "one common theme in these examples is that they consist of coupled layers which undergo morphological changes in response to external or internal constraints such as a simple compression or volumetric growth .",

    "the interplay between the bending of the sheet and the response of the bulk leads to the formation of wrinkles when the sheet is compressed uniaxially . beyond a critical compression the wrinkles vanish and localized folds appear in the sheet .",
    "interestingly , the shape of the sheet on the fluid can be found analytically @xcite as long as the sheet does not touch itself @xcite .    when the substrate is not flat , translational invariance is broken and a whole plethora of folding patterns can be found @xcite . in this article",

    "in contrast to the aforementioned flat system we allow the membrane to stretch azimuthally to accommodate to the external stress . without the solid cylinder constraint the membrane would behave like a hollow cylindrical shell whose mechanics has been studied extensively in the literature @xcite : when compressed the shell develops regular patterns , such as periodic , axisymmetric undulations @xcite or the trapezoidal patterns found by yoshimura in the 1950s @xcite . as is easily confirmed by compressing an empty can of soda , axisymmetric modes of deformation are typically unstable . as we will see below ,",
    "the behavior becomes fundamentally different when the shell enwraps a solid cylinder of same size .",
    "similar to a ruck in a rug @xcite we will consider the case in which the sheet can slide on the cylinder . the only coupling between the sheet and the substrate is _ via _ the hard cylinder constraint .",

    "the negative sign of @xmath129 implies that solutions with more than one fold are unstable : in equilibrium the force @xmath37 has to be a constant along the whole profile for a fixed @xmath128 .",
    "if the profile consisted of @xmath130 folds , each fold @xmath131 would correspond to a solution of the nonlinear system with @xmath132 .",
    "a small compressive fluctuation @xmath133 would decrease the force @xmath134 needed to stabilize the fold @xmath131 .",

    "one observes that the experimental curves converge towards the theoretical solution for increasing radius @xmath1 .",
    "this can be explained by taking a look at our theoretical assumptions again : to simplify the problem we have assumed that @xmath17 is large ( see sec .",

    "we have exemplified the effect of curvature on wrinkling by considering an euler - type buckling in a cylindrical geometry . in our setup , an elastic membrane is wrapped around a cylindrical substrate of same radius and compressed axially . instead of a wrinkle - to - fold transition typical for elastic substrates , a single fold appears immediately above the buckling threshold . for even larger compression ,",
    "the fold breaks symmetry , leading eventually to negative buckling forces .",
    "the theoretical predictions of our simple model were validated with experiments on neoprene sheets and finite element simulations . without a fitting parameter , experiments , simulations and",
    "theory coincide rather remarkably .    while we do not observe wrinkling solutions , we speculate that such periodic solutions would form only if the radius of the _ unstretched _ elastic sheet was larger than @xmath1 : for small amplitudes , the sheet would not be in contact with the cylindrical substrate and thus form the periodic undulations of a free , axially compressed cylindrical sheet . for larger",
    "compression , contact with the rigid substrate eventually occurs , which then most likely leads to the single fold solutions discussed in this article .    in the experiments one can force the sheet over the point of self - contact . due to the friction between the sheet and the substrate a stable equilibrium",
