    "understanding the gravitational collapse of a massive neutron star is of central importance for its connection to some of the most energetic astrophysical phenomena .",
    "such an event may take place within a core - collapse supernova @xcite , or in the late stage of a binary neutron star merger @xcite , and is widely believed to power some types of gamma - ray bursts . in recent years",
    "it has been realized that newly formed stellar mass black holes may be prodigious sources of electromagnetic energy , in addition to driving strong kinetic outflows  @xcite .",
    "we are faced with the exciting possibility of probing the most extreme forms of gravitational collapse using coordinated measurements of electromagnetic transients and gravitational waves .",
    "refining models that make observational predictions for joint gravitational and electromagnetic radiation is critical in order to establish efficient observation campaigns for both traditional astronomers and gravitational - wave astronomers .",
    "it is also a key step toward predicting the delay between peak electromagnetic and gravitational wave emission , the electromagnetic emission pattern ( i.e. the beaming angle ) and the electromagnetic and gravitational wave spectrum .",
    "our focus here is on the evolution of the neutron star s magnetic field during its collapse to a black hole .",
    "we employ fully self - consistent relativistic calculations that follow the dense stellar material as well as the strong electromagnetic and gravitational fields .",
    "a particularly intense electromagnetic transient is generated if the initial magnetic field is very strong ( @xmath0 g ) , that is , if the star is a magnetar .",
    "rapid rotation will enhance the energy of the transient , to a degree that can only be derived by a full time - evolution of the electromagnetic and gravitational fields .",
    "rapid rotation also provides a context for generating strong magnetic fields : when the neutron star is accreting , the shear layer at its surface is a promising site for dynamo action . a distinct magnetosphere will emerge and hold off the accretion flow if even @xmath1 of the energy that is dissipated in the shear layer is converted to a poloidal magnetic field . understanding the evolution of the magnetic field around",
    "an _ isolated _ star is therefore potentially of key relevance for the collapsar and binary merger scenarios of gamma - ray bursts .",
    "recent success in studying the behavior of plasmas around magnetized , spinning , stable neutron stars within flat spacetime has been presented in refs .",
    "@xcite . to study the collapse problem",
    ", one needs general relativity  to account for the role of spacetime curvature ; and general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics ( grmhd )  to determine the internal evolution of the star .",
    "the electromagnetic ( em ) phenomena outside the star can be approached in a variety of ways : through a full grmhd calculation , which generally is very expensive given the low matter density ; or more approximately using vacuum em and force - free equations . in this paper",
    ", we compare all three approaches ( restricting to ideal mhd in the case of grmhd ) .    within general relativity , studies paying attention to neutron star collapse have been presented in the context of isolated stellar collapse ( e.g.  @xcite ) and binary neutron star mergers ( e.g.  @xcite ) with different degrees of realism .",
    "the role of electromagnetic fields are typically examined within general relativistic _",
    "ideal _ mhd and studies have been presented for single  @xcite and binary star systems  @xcite .",
    "such simulations have illustrated important details of the extreme dynamical behavior induced by the system which could trigger tremendously energetic phenomena .",
    "newtonian and general relativistic simulations have shed light on how a binary neutron star merger can amplify pulsar - strength magnetic fields by several orders of magnitude  .",
    "the resulting hypermassive star is generically unstable to black hole formation , which opens up the tantalizing possibility that the increasing rotation rate and magnetic field strength would drive an intense electromagnetic outflow . to study such a scenario ,",
    "our goal here is to combine the grmhd approach with a suitable description of the magnetically - dominated region outside a collapsing star , by applying the force - free approximation .",
    "our approach is related to that of ref .",
    "@xcite , which matched a simplified , analytic , relativistic solution for the interior of a collapsing star ( dust - ball ) with a numerical solution of the coupled einstein - maxwell equations in its exterior .",
    "boundary conditions at the star s surface are provided by the analytic , ideal mhd solution .",
    "we go beyond this simplified scenario in three significant ways .",
    "first , our stars are evolved through collapse consistently by evolving the ideal grmhd equations , and we can therefore consider in principle any kind of compact star . in particular , we have studied both rigidly rotating and non - rotating stars , whereas only the non - rotating case was considered in  @xcite .",
    "second , the magnetosphere is described within the force - free approximation , which , as argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , is a much more realistic model that , for instance , has been instrumental in understanding pulsar spin down  @xcite .",
    "third and last , our matching of the exterior solution with the interior one is dynamical .",
    "thus the force - free solution can adapt to time - dependent fields sourced by the star .",
    "our approach thus allows us to examine many interesting scenarios and we apply it here to study the behavior of collapsing , magnetized , compact stars ( either rotating or not ) , the behavior of surrounding plasma ( as described within the force - free approximation ) and possible electromagnetic radiation induced by the system .",
    "we compare our results with recent estimates in ref .",
    "@xcite for the non - rotating case which predict that the collapse process is smooth and that the magnetic field remains anchored to the star as a black hole forms , leaving a final black hole with a split - monopole field configuration . our work , which follows the dynamics of the system , indicates that in both cases the stars radiate significant electromagnetic energy in which reconnection plays a crucial role , and that this radiation ceases shortly after the formation of a black hole . with force - free",

    "in the presence of matter and electromagnetic fields , the einstein equations must be suitably coupled to both the maxwell and hydrodynamics equations .",
    "this coupling is achieved by considering the stress energy tensor @xmath2 with contributions from matter and electromagnetic energy given respectively by @xmath3 u_a u_b + p g_{ab }   \\ , , \\\\",

    "a general relativistic expression can be obtained by considering a multifluid system of charged species  @xcite , leading to a fully non - linear propagation equation for the spatial component of the current .",
    "however , it usually suffices to consider a simplified version accounting for an algebraic relation between the current and the fields  @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the conductivity of the fluid .",
    "the well - known scalar ohm s law is recovered for @xmath12 .",
    "the equation of motion for the fluid and electromagnetic field are obtained from _ the conservation laws _",
    "@xmath13 which , together with the einstein equations @xmath14 , complete the system of equations governing the dynamics .",
    "once the appropriate form of ohm s law and the conductivity have been specified , using for instance the algebraic relation of eq .",
    "( [ ohm_law ] ) , the resulting equations typically involve vastly different scales , rendering the implementation of these equations quite costly from a computational point of view .",
    "fortunately , for specific regimes certain useful approximations capture the _ most relevant _ physics while bypassing the most strenuous difficulties . for our current purposes , involving magnetized neutron stars ,",
    "the following relevant approximations can be defined and employed in different regimes :    * the _ ideal - mhd _ equations are obtained by requiring that the current remains finite in the limit of infinite conductivity , @xmath15 .",
    "this condition also implies the vanishing of the electric field measured by an observer co - moving with the fluid ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "this approximation is appropriate for the highly conducting matter expected in neutron stars .",
    "however , the numerical evolution of the ideal mhd equations typically fails in low density regions where the inertia of the electromagnetic field is a few orders of magnitude larger than that of the fluid unless sufficient resolution is available .",
    "such resolution requirements increase as the ratio of the electromagnetic to the fluid s inertia ( or magnetic to fluid s pressure ) grows .",
    "consequently , the approach becomes costlier in regions with decreasing physical relevance with respect to bulk matter motion .",
    "such a situation arises in particular in `` vacuum '' regions due to the standard practice of maintaining a density floor ( a so called _ atmosphere _ ) in regions of low density to exploit advanced numerical techniques for relativistic hydrodynamics .",
    "the atmosphere s density is much smaller than that inside the star , so this approach does not affect the relevant matter physics .",
    "however outside the star , the fluid inertia ( or pressure ) is typically much smaller than that of the electromagnetic field in magnetized cases and one generally encounters a large number of numerical difficulties .",
    "different numerical strategies are often introduced to avoid them but such measures can limit one s ability to extract appropriate physics in these regions . *",
    "the _ force - free _ maxwell equations are obtained by assuming the fluid s inertia is much smaller than that of the electromagnetic fields . as a result @xmath17 which in turn implies @xmath18 ( @xmath19 )  @xcite .",
    "this assumption therefore allows one to ignore the explicit time - evolution of the fluid as its dynamics are implicitly prescribed by the charge and current distribution .",
    "this approximation is well suited to the dynamics of the low density , magnetically dominated plasma surrounding a compact object , but it can not account for the physics in dense regions . * the _ vacuum _ maxwell equations are trivially recovered assuming no coupling with matter ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "this is a natural approximation in vacuum regions , far away from the compact objects of interest .",
    "as mentioned , computational costs are presently major obstacles to employ the general equations .",
    "it is thus highly desirable to define a scheme able to model all the relevant regimes in highly dynamical systems simultaneously since none of these three approaches captures all the expected behavior .",
    "in particular we have in mind interacting binary neutron stars , black hole - neutron star binaries as well as the collapse of a magnetized star considered here .",
    "all three systems are believed to play an important role in understanding gamma ray bursts and other energetic events driven by compact stellar - mass objects .    in what follows ,",
    "we describe and apply a _ hybrid _ approach which , while approximate , can account for the dynamical interaction of both gravitating and electromagnetically driven fluids",
    ". such an approach allows one to study the magnetosphere s behavior , in particular energetics and field topology providing important clues for understanding relevant systems . to do so , we take into account that the electromagnetic inertia of a region with high conductivity ( i.e. inside the star ) would be orders of magnitude larger than that of the plasma region .",
    "thus , we can ignore the back - reaction of the electromagnetic field in the plasma region onto that inside the star ( i.e. , a `` passive '' magnetosphere ) .",
    "we exploit this observation to define our approach , which employs both the ideal and force - free approximations suitably matched around the stellar surface .",
    "the matching procedure is such that the star s electromagnetic field provides the boundary conditions for the surrounding region treated with the force - free approximation , but the behavior of the magnetospheric plasma on the high density stellar interior is ignored .",
    "notice that this approach , in a sense , can be regarded as a natural extension of that adopted for studying pulsar - spin down by magnetosphere interactions  @xcite to general relativistic dynamical contexts . in these works ,",
    "only the behavior of the magnetospheric plasma is studied and the star s influence is accounted for by boundary conditions .",
    "we here account for the possible stellar dynamics and consequent influence on the boundary conditions defined for the force - free approximation .    in practical terms , we regard our system as described by two sets of electromagnetic fields : ( i ) the ideal mhd fields @xmath21 and ( ii ) the force - free fields @xmath22 , governed by their respective equations",
    ". both sets of fields are defined with respect to observers orthogonal to the spacelike hypersurfaces employed to foliate the spacetime . thus identifying the appropriate fields for matching",
    "is direct .",
    "the ideal mhd equations are evolved over the entire computational domain , as is customary .",
    "the matching region is determined by fluid density being some value above the vacuum region ( though alternatives based on other physical quantities are obviously possible ) .",
    "in particular , the force - free fields are evolved only in regions where @xmath23 .",
    "dynamic boundary conditions are applied to the force - free fields on the surface at which @xmath24 using the ideal mhd fields @xmath25 these conditions are applied in the spirit of penalty techniques  @xcite in which the equations are modified with driving terms at boundary points in order to enforce the desired boundary condition . in particular , we extend the penalty technique across a number of grid points to effect both the boundary conditions and to `` turn - off '' the evolution of the force - free fields within the higher density regions .",
    "notice that this extension is not mathematically rigorous , but its usage will be justified by examining the solution in different test applications and comparing with the expected behavior . in practice we define a smooth kernel @xmath26 defined as @xmath27 where typically we adopt @xmath28 and @xmath29 , being @xmath30 the value for the density of the atmosphere . in the collapsing cases studied ,",
    "this value is rescaled in time by the ratio of maximum density to the initial maximum density ( see appendix ) .",

    "details of this `` penalty technique '' are presented in  @xcite and examples of applications in general relativity can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the above equations , together with the einstein and grmhd equations are implemented as described in  @xcite to which we refer the reader for further details .",
    "we adopt finite difference techniques on a regular cartesian grid to solve the system . to ensure sufficient resolution in an efficient manner we employ adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) via the had computational infrastructure that provides distributed , berger - oliger style amr  @xcite with full sub - cycling in time , together with an improved treatment of artificial boundaries  @xcite .",
    "the refinement regions are determined using truncation error estimation provided by a shadow hierarchy  @xcite which adapts dynamically to ensure the estimated error is bounded within a pre - specified tolerance .",
    "the spatial discretization of the geometry and force - free fields is performed using a fourth order accurate scheme satisfying the summation by parts rule , and high resolution shock capturing methods based on the hlle flux formulae with ppm reconstruction are used to discretize the fluid variables  @xcite .",

    ", one therefore ensures that the courant - friedrichs - levy  ( cfl ) condition dictated by the principal part of the equations is satisfied .    to extract physical information",
    ", we monitor several quantities : ( i ) the matter variables and spacetime behavior , ( ii ) the electromagnetic field configuration and fluxes , and ( iii ) the electromagnetic newman - penrose ( complex ) radiative scalar ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "this scalar is computed by contracting the maxwell tensor with a suitably defined null tetrad @xmath38 and it accounts for the energy carried off by outgoing waves to infinity .",
    "the luminosity of the electromagnetic waves is @xmath39    additionally we monitor the ratio of particular components of the maxwell tensor @xmath40 which , in the stationary , axisymmetric case , can be interpreted as the rotation frequency of the electromagnetic field  @xcite .",
    "initial data for the hybrid equations involve the intrinsic metric ( @xmath41 ) and extrinsic curvature ( @xmath42 ) on a given hypersurface , as well as the magnetized fluid configuration in terms of its primitive variables @xmath43 .",
    "the initial data for the geometry and the fluid of rigidly rotating neutron stars are provided by the lorene package _ magstar _",
    "@xcite , which adopts a polytropic equation of state @xmath44 with @xmath45 rescaled to @xmath46 .",
    "because the fluid inertia of a neutron star is many orders of magnitude larger than its electromagnetic one , the magnetic field will have a negligible effect on both the geometry and the fluid structure , and so it can be specified freely .",
    "unless noted otherwise , in our simulations we have chosen a dipolar structure for the initial magnetic field .",
    "the electric fields are set by assuming the ideal mhd condition eq .",
    "( [ efromb ] ) , with zero fluid velocity in the exterior region .",
    "additionally , we require initial data for the force - free fields @xmath31 . inside the star",
    ", they are defined to be exactly the same as their ideal mhd counterparts . outside the star , the magnetic field",
    "is well defined by the dipolar solution , while the electric field is computed by assuming that the magnetosphere rotates rigidly with the star up to @xmath47 ( @xmath48 is the stellar radius ) , and imposing again the ideal mhd condition for the electric field .",
    "this configuration provides consistent data for the problem ; however such data will not necessarily conform to the physical situation considered and so an unphysical early transient will be generated .",
    "we first establish that the adopted procedure is indeed able to capture correctly the dynamics of relevant systems .",
    "since the ideal mhd approximation is self - consistently evolved throughout the computational domain , our tests must address the behavior of the force - free fields .",
    "to do so , we first examine the convergence of our implementation and then illustrate that the approach provides the expected behavior by comparing with certain recently studied cases .      adopting a stable and non - rotating stellar solution with mass @xmath49 and equatorial radius @xmath50 , from which we remove all initial pressure , we examine convergence of the force - free fields as the star collapses .",
    "this scheme contains `` standard '' sources of error , such as : ( i )  truncation error of our finite difference approximation of maxwell s equations , ( ii )  errors associated with our application of the force - free conditions , ( iii )  the various numerical errors ( truncation and constraint violations ) associated with our grmhd implementation as well as ( iv )  errors associated with our dynamic boundary condition that matches the force - free fields to the corresponding mhd fields inside the star .",
    "a detailed analysis of these errors is delicate and involved ; however we illustrate that the fields obtained by this approach converge to a unique solution with increasing grid resolution .",
    "we therefore evolve the collapse of a non - rotating star at three different resolutions with fixed mesh refinement  ( fmr ) .",
    "we subtract a high resolution run ( with coarse level grid of @xmath51 points ) and a medium resolution run ( of dimension @xmath52 ) and do similarly for the medium and low resolutions ( of dimension @xmath53 ) .",
    "these two differences are plotted at @xmath54 ( i.e. , when the radius of the star starts to shrink ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonrotatingconvergence ] which shows that the difference decreases with increasing resolution , consistent with convergence .",
    "next we consider a stationary force - free solution representing a rotating neutron star with a monopole magnetic field  @xcite , and compare to our results . to minimize effects due to oscillations of the star ( induced by perturbations to the star induced by the discretization ) , the geometry and mhd fields are kept to their initial values and are not evolved .",
    "the initial data correspond to a rigidly rotating neutron star near the mass shedding limit , with a mass @xmath55 and an equatorial radius @xmath56 , rotating with a period of @xmath57 .",
    "the magnetic field is given by @xmath58 , regularized conveniently near the origin .",
    "as described earlier , the initial electric field satisfies the ideal mhd condition in a rigidly co - rotating magnetosphere which extends initially up to @xmath59 .",
    "the evolution is performed in a cubic domain of length @xmath60 with only two fmr grids and the star is placed at the origin .",
    "the maximum resolution is @xmath61 , so that roughly 30 grid points cover the star .",
    "this resolution is sufficient for this test as both the geometry and matter variables are kept fixed and only the force - free equations are evolved until reaching a quasi - stationary configuration .",
    "the behaviour of different fields across the surface of the star after the solution has settled are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : monopole_bfield ] , which plots radial profiles of : the kernel function @xmath62 , the density @xmath5 , and the non - trivial components of the magnetic field .",
    "as illustrated in the figure , the radial magnetic field only changes outside the star , where there also appears a toroidal component indicating the rotation of the magnetic fields in the magnetosphere .",
    "overall the electromagnetic fields are seen to relax rather quickly to a state approaching the expected one .",
    "another measure of the obtained solution is given by the ( normalized ) rotational frequency of the magnetic field @xmath63 in fig .",
    "[ fig : monopole_omega ] .",
    "as time progresses , this value approaches @xmath64 as expected in a radially smooth way .",
    "a particularly challenging test of our approach is the aligned rotator solution  ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "the aligned rotator is a numerical solution of the force - free equations outside a rotating surface representing a star that demonstrates closed field lines within the light cylinder ( lc ) .",
    "this problem has been studied by a number of authors  @xcite working in flat space with a computational domain consisting only of the stellar exterior . in these",
    "works the star s influence is accounted for through suitable boundary conditions derived from the expected electromagnetic field at its surface .",
    "these efforts were specifically motivated to obtain the solution in the magnetosphere of isolated pulsars and , in particular , to understand a possible spin - down mechanism that works even when the star s dipolar field is aligned with its angular momentum .",
    "as already mentioned , our approach differs in that we solve for the stellar interior , we work within curved space and our computational grid does not conform to the star s geometry .",
    "because of these differences and also because our initial data for the force - free fields is only nonzero in the immediate neighborhood of the star , achieving the expected late - stage stationary solution dynamically constitutes a demanding test .",
    "we note that the time and length scales required for such a test with respect to a realistic star are too computationally demanding if we are to capture the main physical aspects of the solution ( i.e. field topology , location of the light - cylinder , development of a current sheet , etc ) . instead of a realistic star , we adopt a rapidly rotating star so that the light cylinder is brought closer to the star where there is enough resolution to resolve it and render the dynamical time scales shorter and easier to follow numerically .",
    "to achieve such rapid rotation , we resort to an unstable star but prevent the instability from disrupting the star by artificially freezing both fluid and geometry .",
    "consequently we only evolve the force - free equations and compare the obtained configuration with the expected solution .",
    "we adopt a rotating star with a mass @xmath65 , equatorial / polar radius of @xmath66 and rotational period @xmath67 .",
    "the light cylinder for this star is located at @xmath68 .",
    "the electromagnetic field is initially set similar to that in the previous monopole test , but with a poloidal magnetic field given by a dipole outside the star .",
    "the evolution is performed in a cubic domain of @xmath69 with four fmr levels with resolutions @xmath70 .",
    "the fmr hierarchy consists of centered cubes with side lengths @xmath71 , so that there are roughly 70 points across the star in the equatorial plane .",
    "we evolve this star until the solution settles to a quasi - stationary solution .",
    "[ fig : pulsar_bfield ] illustrates the magnetic field topology at three representative times . in the last frame",
    ", we show the configuration to which the field settles , illustrating features predicted by known solutions for the aligned rotator . in particular , one can observe a region of closed field lines bounded at the expected radius , denoting the light cylinder .",
    "having tested our hybrid approximation to em field evolution , we now focus on the collapse of a magnetized star .",
    "the star may or may not be rotating , the rotating case being of greater astrophysical relevance .",
    "in particular , we are interested in studying how the magnetosphere responds , and the distribution of escaping electromagnetic radiation .    here",
    "it is essential to capture both the dynamics of the collapsing star and the surrounding magnetoplasma , since the two are tightly coupled .",
    "it is worth recalling that the introduction of rotation introduces a fundamental difference in the radiative output of stationary ( non - collapsing ) stars as calculated in the electrovacuum and force - free limits : the spindown torque of an aligned rotator vanishes in electrovacuum but does not in the force - free case .",
    "furthermore , this torque is strong and its magnitude varies only modestly with inclination angle  @xcite .",
    "previous studies of the magnetosphere of a collapsing star are fairly limited .",
    "some pioneering work in @xcite focused on the electrovacuum behavior of a non - rotating star . while this study included the effects of strong gravity , by neglecting plasma or rotation it was not able to capture the winding of the magnetic field during the collapse .",
    "the analytic study by @xcite estimated the em output during the collapse by applying the formula for the spindown luminosity of an equilibrium rotator , @xmath72 , where @xmath48 is the stellar radius , @xmath73 the surface magnetic field , and @xmath74 the spin frequency .",
    "however , when the collapse time is shorter than the rotation period ( as must be the case if the star is to avoid a rotational hang - up ) , the outer magnetosphere near the light cylinder is not able to follow the change in the surface magnetic field , and this equilibrium formula does not apply . instead",
    ", twisting of the closed magnetic field lines is expected at a radius @xmath75   with the time for an alfvn wave to propagate from the star out to @xmath76 along a dipole field line . ] , where @xmath77 is the collapse time .",
    "the corresponding toroidal magnetic field is @xmath78 , where @xmath79 in a dipole geometry .",
    "the power injected into the magnetosphere is @xmath80 which is larger than the equilibrium spindown power by a factor @xmath81 .    to determine the dependence of @xmath82 on @xmath48 , equation ( [ eq : lwind ] )",
    "must be combined with the conservation of magnetic flux , @xmath83 constant ; and the appropriate scaling between @xmath74 and @xmath48 ( @xmath84 for self - similar collapse ) .",
    "the collapse does not , in general , follow a simple power - law relation between @xmath85 and @xmath48 , but in the special case of pressureless collapse from a large radius ( @xmath86 ) one obtains @xmath87 . it should be re - emphasized that equation ( [ eq : lwind ] ) represents energy stored in the magnetosphere , and so the maximum amount of energy that can only escape to infinity after the collapse is completed .    during the last , relativistic stages of the collapse , additional physical effects arise .",
    "spacetime curvature has a mixed effect on magnetic field winding in the magnetosphere .",
    "on the one hand , the rotation frequency is reduced with respect to the newtonian value ; on the other hand , torsional alfvn waves in the force - free magnetosphere slow down significantly as the horizon approaches the surface of the star .",
    "the net result , as we show , is that the magnetic field becomes strongly wound up if the star is rotating close to breakup before the collapse , and develops @xmath88 after the collapse . to clarify the influence of plasma and rotation , and to make useful comparisons ,",
    "we have made a parallel set of runs in the electrovacuum approximation .",
    "these are obtained straightforwardly by setting @xmath89 and not enforcing the conditions @xmath90 in eqs .",

    "this calculation followed the transition to a black hole , and the ringdown of the em field threading the horizon .    in reality , the medium outside the star is an excellent electrical conductor .",
    "as is argued in @xcite , a combination of large voltages and strong gravitational fields will trigger runaway pair creation near compact objects @xcite . in a strongly dynamic situation",

    "additional power will flow along the magnetic field lines that thread the ergosphere , but this portion of the black hole magnetosphere will mix with the accretion flow and may be less strongly magnetized .",
    "the interesting conclusion here is that the rapid twisting up of the magnetic field during the collapse can generate a larger em output than a fairly extended jet emission after the collapse .",
    "it is worth summarizing the three main sources of this result : i ) before the horizon forms , the em power is proportional to @xmath242 rather than @xmath243 ; ii ) the magnetic flux remains pinned in the star for a few rotation periods during the collapse ( before the onset of the black hole ) , and then springs out to fill a larger volume ; and iii ) the relation between rotation frequency and angular momentum is enhanced by a factor @xmath244 prior to the collapse ; in other words , relativistic gravity has the effect of softening the growth of the rotation frequency as the star collapses",
    ".    a reduction in the trapped flux ( due to outward diffusion of the magnetic field into the torus ) would , in this situation , initially _ increase _ the blandford - znajek power flowing from the horizon .",
    "the pressure of the trapped field approximately balances the ram pressure of the accretion flow at some point outside the horizon .",
    "therefore a reduction in the trapped flux allows the flow to reach closer to the black hole , and attain higher pressures , before being interrupted .",
    "although we are considering the flux originating in a dynamo process before the collapse ( sec .",
    "[ s : dynamo ] ) , continued flux generation in the torus by the magnetorotational instability @xcite could play a role in modulating the jet power .",

    "in addition , @xmath196 depends indirectly on the torus mass and pressure through the strength of the magnetic field that is required to hold off the torus material from the neutron star surface .",
    "the larger accretion rate in a collapsar environment implies a larger transient energy .",
    "it is possible to make a direct comparison with the blandford - znajek jet that follows the collapse , if the magnetic flux that threads the black hole is left behind by the collapsing magnetar . combining equations ( [ eq : lsd ] ) and ( [ eq : lbz_2 ] ) , and taking pre - collapse rotation period and radius @xmath249 msec and @xmath250 km",

    "the equation of state used gave a fast collapse to a bh ( within @xmath257 ms ) , and therefore precluded the surface shear dynamo that we have conjectured .",

    "( [ eq : dele ] ) , one sees that the pre - collapse star would release a comparable energy within @xmath258 ms after forming a magnetosphere . however , it is well known ( e.g. @xcite ) that such an outflow would bear a much higher density of nucleons than a blandford - znajek jet from a black hole , due to the absorption of electron - type neutrinos and anti - neutrinos .",
    "we expect that this nucleon loading would be strongly suppressed in the dynamical collapse phase , due to i ) the relatively short duration of the emission ; ii ) the strongly wound field geometry ( @xmath259 ) ; and iii ) redshifting effects .",
    "combining these effects suggests a significant suppression @xmath260 in the nucleon loading , so that the mass ejected would essentially be that present in the magnetosphere before the collapse .      the immediate aftermath of a binary neutron star merger is distinguished from disk accretion onto a black hole , in that the velocity shear is strongest where the orbiting material makes a transition from centrifugal to hydrostatic support .",
    "another feature which distinguishes the merger remnant from ordinary accreting neutron stars ( x - ray pulsars ) is that it does not initially have an ordered magnetosphere .",
    "long after the first stage of the merger is complete , the velocity shear provides a tremendous source of free energy for amplifying a magnetic field .",

    "note that the surface shear becomes more radially concentrated with time : as differential rotation is erased in the interior of the merger remnant , the surface shear is maintained by continuing accretion .",
    "the inner part of the shear layer develops positive @xmath263 and the magnetorotational instability is extinguished .",
    "a strong _ feedback mechanism _ is present which allows rapid magnetic field growth , but causes this growth to saturate once the star is able to form a magnetosphere that holds off the accretion flow .",
    "when the magnetosphere is present , the accreting material follows the magnetic field and reaches the star at the same angular velocity .",
    "shearing of the magnetic field in the outer layers of the star is therefore turned off .",
    "this effect is clearly demonstrated in the 3d accretion simulations of @xcite .",
    "only a tiny fraction of the accretion energy @xmath264 must be converted to a poloidal magnetic field to hold off the accretion flow : substituting ( [ eq : bmag ] ) into the dipole energy ( [ eq : edipole0 ] ) gives @xmath265 over a duration @xmath209 .",
    "low - mass x - ray binaries provide a nice example of systems where this feedback appears to operate .",
    "the millisecond radio pulsars that are descended from them have magnetic fields that are just strong enough ( @xmath266 g ) to hold off an eddington - level accretion flow onto a neutron star  but not much stronger .",
    "the absence of persistent pulsations in the majority of lmxbs then requires that the magnetic field be aligned with the angular momentum of the accretion flow .",
    "now let us consider how the magnetic field evolves in the surface shear layer .",
    "the field present initially in the merging stars is rapidly amplified by a kelvin - helmholtz instability @xcite , or the magnetorotational instability @xcite .",
    "rapid growth of the magnetic field on large scales is sensitive to the speed of magnetic reconnection in the fluid , and requires three - dimensional motions .",
    "the two - dimensional wrapping of a magnetic field by kelvin - helmholtz vortices does not generate net flux ; and the initial growth length of the mri is very small compared with the scale height of the torus .",
    "mri growth is fastest on a scale @xmath267 in a torus of mass @xmath268 @xcite .",
    "the hydrostatic structure of the inner shear layer makes it easier for the magnetic field to be pinned and retained than it would be in the surrounding torus .",
    "the magnetic field threading the shear layer is wound up , and since @xmath269 , the mean toroidal flux density grows at least in a linear manner .",
    "if a hot , rotating , and massive neutron star ( @xmath270 ) can survive collapse for more than @xmath258 ms , as is suggested by recent simulations of @xcite , then this toroidal field becomes quite strong .",
    "even if the seed poloidal field is as weak as @xmath271 g  within the range of pulsar fields  then the toroidal field reaches @xmath272\\delta t\\ ,",

    "exponential magnetic field growth becomes possible when the wound - up field can rise buoyantly through the shear layer .",
    "the large dissipated power ( [ eq : shearpower ] ) will generate a strongly positive entropy gradient in the inner part of the shear layer .",
    "where the material is convectively stable , only magnetic fields stronger than @xmath274 g can directly overcome the pressure of the overlying material .",
    "but even in this case , the intense flux of electron - type neutrinos allows a magnetic field stronger than @xmath275 g to rise buoyantly on the alfvn timescale , by erasing gradients in entropy and electron fraction that impede buoyancy @xcite .",
    "the buoyancy time is @xmath276 across a pressure scale height @xmath277 .",
    "thus an exponential feedback loop appears quite likely in this situation .",
    "one observes that the large - scale dipole magnetic field that emerges may be sensitive to the seed magnetic field , in the sense that a _ minimal _ seed field is required for the linearly wound field to reach the buoyancy threshold .",
    "nonetheless , it is also clear that magnetar - strength magnetic fields do not require magnetar - strength seed fields in the presence of persistent surface shear .    the strength of the magnetosphere that eventually emerges results from a competition between the finite rate of amplification and the diminishing shear stress at the surface of the star .",
    "at an age of @xmath278 , a poloidal magnetic field stronger than @xmath279 g ( @xmath280 g ) will begin to apply a strong , negative feedback on the surface shear .",
    "once the torus mass drops to the point that accretion is mediated mainly by magnetic stresses , the accretion rate is @xmath281 s@xmath119 . here",
    "@xmath282 and @xmath283 are the initial torus mass and diffusion time in this viscous phase , and @xmath213 is the viscosity coefficient .",
    "the accretion rate drops as the torus material spreads outward , as @xmath284 , as long as the torus remains geometrically thick and conserves its angular momentum ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we now consider the observational imprint of a magnetar if it forms by the accretion of a thin layer of strongly sheared material , but is ( initially ) gravitationally stable .",
    "we focus on the rate of energy loss and the spin history of the star .",
    "there is a substantial reduction in the energy release by spindown , compared with a star that initially rotated as a solid body , due to the internal rearrangement of angular momentum .",
    "approximate solid - body rotation is attained on the poloidal alfvn timescale @xmath285 , which is generally much shorter than the magnetic - dipole spindown time @xmath286 most of the shear energy is then dissipated _",
    "internally_.    a delayed collapse is possible if the magnetar only slightly exceeds the maximum mass for a non - rotating , zero - temperature neutron star .",
    "the loss of rotational support by a magnetic wind would trigger a collapse on the rotational braking time .",
    "quite generally , the accretion of a thin layer of strongly sheared material provides an attractive mechanism for creating magnetars , and so the results of this section should have a broader application to the galactic magnetar population , even if these stars are well below the maximum mass .",
    "several possible channels are available : the rotation of the accreting material could be generated by an instability of the supernova shock @xcite ; or the neutron star could be exposed to material with very strong vorticity in a merger event , e.g. when it merges with a companion co white dwarf , or with the core of an evolving be star .",
    "the spindown power that is released by the magnetar is then reduced significantly compared with a star which rotates uniformly with the same angular velocity as the surface material . the final spin period resulting from the accretion of a layer of mass @xmath287 and rotation period @xmath288 onto a neutron star of total mass @xmath289 is @xmath290^{-1 } p_{\\rm shear}\\cr             & = & 10.5\\,j_{\\rm shear}^{-1}\\left({m_{\\rm ns}\\over 2\\,m_\\odot}\\right)\\quad{\\rm ms},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath291 . as the star spins down , it deposits a rotational energy @xmath292 in the surrounding shock wave . for a magnetar of polar field @xmath112 ,",
    "the corresponding spindown luminosity is fairly modest , @xmath293 and the star enters the extended spindown phase after a time @xmath294 in this situation , only a very strong internal magnetic field ( @xmath295 g ) would induce sufficient triaxiality in the star that the gravity wave torque competed with the external electromagnetic torque @xcite .",
    "escaping loops of magnetic field are observed in our non - rotating simulations .",
    "these loops are formed by magnetic reconnection , which means their size and rate of formation are sensitive to the treatment of resistivity , and to the disregard of stresses associated with bulk plasma flow by the adoption of the force - free equations .",
    "an outgoing plasmoid ( containing plasma and a closed magnetic field ) has a well - defined center of mass : we find that its bulk motion is measurably smaller than the speed of light , @xmath296 and @xmath297 , at a distance @xmath298 times the pre - collapse neutron star radius @xmath299 .",
    "this is significantly less relativistic than the bulk motion expected for a gas of freely expanding particles released by the collapsed star ( @xmath300 ) .    after addressing each of these issues ,",
    "we make contact with the giant gamma - ray flares of the galactic magnetars .",
    "these appear to involve the ejection of an energetic plasmoid ( @xmath301 erg ) , but due to the shearing of the magnetic field lines rather than the collapse of the star @xcite .      when magnetic field lines of an opposing sense are stretched out and forced into contact , the rate at which they reconnect is sensitive to the microscopic model of resistivity . in an ohmic plasma with a uniform resistivity ,",
    "a long current sheet forms and reconnection is very slow ; fast reconnection with an x - point geometry depends on a local maximum in the resistivity @xcite . in some contexts , such as the solar corona ,",
    "the microscopic explanation for this behavior may be provided by the hall terms in the conductivity @xcite .",
    "these are relatively less important if the plasma is loaded with @xmath302 pairs , as would be expected in the magnetosphere of a collapsing magnetar . in a fluid",
    ", small - scale hydromagnetic turbulence appears to greatly accelerate the reconnection rate @xcite ; but whether such a process can operate in a low-@xmath303 plasma of astrophysical dimensions is not yet determined .    in the present work we find evidence for relatively fast reconnection of magnetic field lines , @xmath304 , as calculated in the force - free approximation ( sec .",
    "[ subsec : nonrotating ] ) .",
    "this results from a change in topology of the field lines ( the formation of an x - point ) .",
    "it is not due to strongly enhanced dissipation in an extended equatorial current sheet : @xmath120 dissipation is measured to be small in both the rotating and non - rotating cases . such a concern arises in force - free calculations of pulsar magnetospheres , where the magnetic field is less dynamic and is anchored in the star . there",
    "the absence of fluid pressure support in the current sheet leads to a rapid collapse of the magnetic field toward the sheet , unless explicitly compensated @xcite . in the present case , after the black hole forms the inflow of magnetic flux toward the equator can continue in a more dynamic manner into the star , or out to the computational boundary .",
    "a recent treatment of reconnection in the magnetosphere of a stationary black hole @xcite illustrates a slower field decay when employing an ideal mhd treatment , as compared to a force - free approach .",
    "( resistivity in the mhd case arises through the numerical approximation . )",
    "such a slower decay is also observed at late stages after the formation of the black hole in our simulations when comparing force - free and ideal mhd fields and our implementation does not cope with as large magnetizations as that in  @xcite . ] ; though by this time the field strengths are orders of magnitude below their peak values .",
    "a comparison of force - free and mhd reconnection calculations which explores more general resistivity models , and their influence on the reconnection geometry , remains to be developed .",
    "reconnection is usually studied in a context where the plasma flow speed along the magnetic field is a small fraction of the alfvn speed : for example , in a steady mhd wind , the conservation of angular momentum implies a slow drift of particles along the spiral magnetic field outside the alfvn critical point .",
    "however , in some contexts , such as magnetar flares , the flow speed can approach the speed of light . similarly , in our collapse simulations we see large - amplitude motions on the magnetic field loops threading the neutron star , which suggest strong plasma heating .",
    "the backreaction of the outflowing plasma on the reconnection of field lines is not taken into account .",
    "even when the magnetic field has a tendency to reconnect through an x - point , reconnection will be _ delayed _ until the kinetic pressure @xmath305 of the outflowing pair - photon plasma ( with thermal energy density @xmath306 ) drops below the poynting flux that would flow toward the current sheet in the absence of plasma flow .",
    "one requires @xmath307 where the coefficient on the right - hand - side is appropriate for fast x - point reconnection .",
    "the magnetic field lines are stretched outward by the plasma flow beyond an alfvn radius @xcite @xmath308 given @xmath309 .",
    "note that , at the peak of the outflow , the pressure of the pair - photon fluid is comparable to the pressure of the stretched magnetic field lines at @xmath310 , and outside this radius grows as @xmath311 with respect to the split - monopole field pressure .",
    "for example , in a magnetar giant flare , the @xmath312 s width of the main gamma - ray pulse is comparable to the time for magnetic and elastic stresses to rearrange the stellar interior ; but it is @xmath214 times longer than the flow time out to the alfvn radius ( [ eq : ralf ] ) , and therefore much longer than the timescale for x - point reconnection at a speed @xmath313 .      a magnetically - dominated plasma that is ejected from a collapsing magnetar ( or a nearby soft gamma repeater ) can be a much stronger source of synchrotron emission than a shocked plasma of comparable energy density .",
    "existing calculations of radio afterglows of short grbs ( @xcite and references therein ) , as well as calculations of the radio afterglow of sgr giant flares @xcite , focus on synchrotron emission by a population of non - thermal electrons that are accelerated at a shock that leads the outflow . for the bulk of grbs , one infers efficiencies of conversion @xmath314 of bulk kinetic energy to non - thermal electrons and to magnetic fields downstream of the forward shock .",
    "these moderate values of @xmath315 and @xmath316 are consistent with the broadband tails of radio  x - ray emission that follow the brief , bright gamma - ray phase .",
    "the synchrotron emission from a magnetically - dominated plasmoid will be proportionately much brighter , by up to a factor @xmath258 , for two reasons .",
    "first , and most obviously , @xmath316 now approaches unity .",
    "second , if the magnetic energy density dominates the thermal energy density , then a cascade process ( involving the creation of high - wavenumber alfvn modes ) preferentially heats the electrons @xcite .",
    "if the plasma is very relativistic , damping is mainly due to charge - starvation of the waves , at wavenumbers where the amplitude of the fluctuating current density begins to exceed @xmath317 @xcite .",
    "( a different damping mechanism operates at higher ion densities : the waves are landau - damped on the parallel motion of the electrons . ) in practice , the relative amplitudes of the bulk synchrotron emission and the shock emission will depend on the degree of disorder in the plasmoid magnetic field .",
    "but for magnetar flares , indirect evidence that bulk synchrotron emission dominates comes from a rapid initial drop in radio flux that is consistent with the sudden compression of the plasmoid , followed by rapid adiabatic cooling @xcite .",
    "magnetar outbursts involve more limited releases of energy that leave the original star intact .",
    "they are triggered when the footpoints of a @xmath275 g magnetic field are strongly sheared by an elastic instability of a neutron star crust , thereby generating a hot plasma and an intense burst of gamma - rays @xcite .",
    "the first , extremely bright , stage of a giant magnetar flare lasts only @xmath318 and bears a considerable resemblance to a ` classical ' gamma - ray burst , demonstrating high temperatures ( @xmath319 kev ) and a significant non - thermal component to the spectrum  @xcite .",
    "( this phase saturates almost all x - ray detectors , but was well - resolved by the geotail experiment @xcite in the 27 august 1998 and 27 december 2004 flares . )",

    "the giant flares appear to involve the ejection of a plasmoid .",
    "the combination of fast variability and extreme luminosity ( up to @xmath321 ergs s@xmath119 ) implies , through the usual arguments of gamma - ray opacity @xcite , that the emitting plasma has expanded to a much larger volume than that of the neutron star .",
    "this expanding plasma is an excellent electrical conductor and must carry some of the stellar magnetic field with it .",
    "this expected property of magnetar giant flares helps to explain two apparently contradictory phenomena .",
    "a straightforward argument based on the theory of thermal fireballs ( e.g. @xcite ) shows that the expanding plasma is moving with a high lorentz factor at the radius ( @xmath322 cm ) where it becomes transparent to the gamma - rays @xcite .",
    "the observation of variability on a timescale @xmath323 in the gamma - ray flux implies strong constraints on the baryon rest energy flux .",
    "the advected electrons and ions must become transparent to the gamma - rays close enough to the magnetar that the differential light - travel time @xmath324 across the outflowing plasma is shorter than @xmath325 . given a total outflow luminosity @xmath326 , this implies that the ion rest energy contributes no more than a fraction @xmath327 of the energy flux .",
    "on the other hand , radio monitoring detected transient emission in the weeks following both flares  @xcite .",
    "the emission following the 2004 flare was especially bright , as befitting the much greater energy of the burst , and could be tracked on the sky for more than a year .",
    "the expansion of the radio source implies a transverse velocity @xmath328 @xcite .",
    "after this , clear evidence is seen for a break in the radio light curve consistent with a transition from uniform expansion to a sedov - like phase .",
    "we infer that the measured proper motion is probably the free expansion velocity , as corrected for relativistic aberration .    in principle",
    "it is possible for the measured transverse speed to be less than the speed of light , if the intrinsic motion @xmath329 is nearly luminal but the motion is directed away from the observer ( at some angle @xmath330 with respect to the line of sight to the magnetar ) : @xmath331 .",
    "the observed relative brightness of both the radio and gamma - ray emission argues against this : one measures @xmath332 in 2004 vs. @xmath333 in 1998 , and a radio flux @xmath334 mjy vs. 0.3 @xmath335jy at @xmath336 ghz 1 week after the flare @xcite .",

    "a closed loop of magnetic field carries a finite inertia , and so its center - of - mass frame will not accelerate with distance from the source as does that of a collimated particle beam .",
    "the outflowing pair - photon fluid must overcome the tension of the magnetic field lines that are anchored in the star , and so comparable energy can be put into the stretched field , which is pulled into a split - monopole configuration .",

    "we conclude that , in a magnetar giant flare , most of the released magnetic energy tends to _ follow _ the pair - photon pulse , with the delay between the two components being due to continued shearing of the external magnetic as the interior of the magnetar adjusts on the internal alfvn time of @xmath345 .",
    "understanding the global behavior of strongly gravitating , dynamical systems , containing dense matter coupled to ultra - strong magnetic fields , is of key importance for a thorough understanding of possible signals from them . in this work ,",
    "we have presented a new approach to this end by combining the ideal mhd and force - free approximations in a suitable manner within general relativity .",
    "we expect that this hybrid scheme represents real progress towards greater realism .",
    "the stellar interior utilizes ideal mhd to faithfully model the neutron star without the disadvantages incumbent in the low density exterior .",
    "likewise , the exterior solution uses the force - free approach and so captures the dynamics of the tenuous plasma .",
    "the entire domain is described by a fully nonlinear and fully dynamic general relativity solution necessary for strong - field gravity . indeed , a key aspect of this approach is its generality .",
    "it does not require a prescribed stationary stellar boundary , and can be applied , for example , to dynamical systems such as collapsing stars and non - vacuum compact binaries .",
    "we have exploited this approach to study stellar collapse in both rotating and non - rotating cases .",
    "our studies reveal a rich phenomenology in the magnetosphere as the collapse proceeds .",
    "in particular , magnetic reconnection plays an important role by inducing strong electromagnetic emission as well as the infall of electromagnetic energy into the black hole , which in a short time loses all its ` hair ' .",
    "when the star starts off rapidly rotating , the energy of the magnetospheric plasma grows significantly during the collapse .",
    "as the star rotates faster , its magnetic field lines do not have time to re - adjust to the increased rotation , and are strongly wound up out to the initial light cylinder .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that this conversion of dynamical energy into electromagnetic energy does not depend on resistive effects .",
    "two issues of principle have arisen in performing these calculations .",
    "first , we have shown conclusively that the force - free approximation to the evolution of a dilute , relativistic plasma inevitably leads to singularities .",
    "these singularities are avoided in our calculations by continuously pruning the electric field . in the simulations that we have run",
    ", this procedure appears to cause limited energy dissipation , but its necessity should be kept in mind .",
    "the second issue of principle regards the dependence of the reconnection geometry on the resistivity model .",
    "fluid pressure is responsible for slowing down the rate of reconnection unless an x - point geometry is able to form . by neglecting fluid pressure",
    ", the force - free approximation clearly facilitates the formation of x - points . in spite of this",
    ", we observe very limited numerical dissipation in current sheets .",
    "although the plasma that is represented by our model magnetospheres is , in reality , strongly collisional , it should be kept in mind that fast x - point reconnection still occurs in collisional plasmas in the presence of hydromagnetic turbulence  as has been demonstrated so far in weakly magnetized plasmas @xcite .",
    "some further exploration of the reconnection geometry is possible in resistive mhd calculations of stellar collapse by varying the spatial dependence of the resistivity .",
    "we have also discussed how the electromagnetic outbursts from collapsing magnetars may have interesting observational effects . in particular ,",
    "our results are relevant to binary neutron star merger scenarios , in which a hypermassive neutron star forms and collapses to a black hole . collapse to a black hole can happen either promptly or after many dynamical times , depending on the masses involved and the equation of state describing the stars ( see , for instance ,  @xcite ) . although kelvin - helmholtz and magnetorotational instabilities will create ultrastrong magnetic fields ( @xmath346 g ) , we have suggested that the global field ( in particular , the amount of magnetic flux threading the merger remnant and eventual black hole ) could depend strongly on the lifetime of the remnant .",
    "the formation of a distinct magnetosphere would require tapping only @xmath347 of the energy dissipated in shear layer at the remnant surface .",
    "as such a star collapsed , the magnetosphere would qualitatively follow the behavior outlined here .",
    "the electromagnetic output of the collapse could compete with the later emission from a blandford - znajek jet emanating from the black hole horizon , and source a powerful electromagnetic counterpart to the gravity wave signal ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",

    "it is important to stress , however , that our approach is not free of ambiguities , in particular with respect to how and where the matching between the force - free and ideal mhd regions is implemented .",
    "to the extent possible , we have tested the robustness of our results versus known solutions , which give us confidence in this approach .    * _ acknowledgments : _ * it is a pleasure to thank p. goldreich for insights and discussions during the course of this work .",

    "computations were performed at teragrid and scinet .",
    "details of the transition from the ideal mhd regime to the force - free regime merit particular attention , especially in our rotating collapse solutions .",
    "since we match two different formulations of maxwell s equations coupled to conducting matter , it is important to understand how the choice of matching layer affects the exterior force - free solution .",
    "of course , an unambiguous test can only be provided by a complete resistive mhd solution that can handle the strongly magnetized regions outside the star and , in particular , can follow the large changes in density and rotation that are encountered during the collapse . while work on this direction is in progress",
    ", the simpler approach presented here allows us to obtain a first solution to the relativistic magnetosphere in this strongly dynamic situation .",
    "the positioning of the matching zone is constrained by competing considerations . on the one hand , if it sits too close to the surface , then the interior mhd solution that sources the exterior force - free solution will be unrealistic , due to the density floor that is applied in the mhd atmosphere .",
    "one thus might want to place the transition layer well within the stellar surface .",
    "however , such a deep layer might underestimate the magnetic field strength at the base of the magnetosphere , and imply force - free behavior of the magnetic field where that approximation is not justified    in particular , we have found that placing the transition zone at too low a density implies an unrealistically large toroidal magnetic field at the base of the force - free zone . recall that the region exterior to the star , with its tenuous plasma , will have a relatively large magnetization , and should be forced to co - rotate with the interior of the star . unless prohibitively high resolution is employed",
    ", the atmosphere of the mhd solution has a large enough inertia that this condition can be violated .",
    "instead , the magnetic field experiences a non - negligible ( and non - physical ) differential rotation .",
    "this effect is easily exacerbated in a collapsing solution .    within our current approach ,",
    "we address these issues in two ways , by ( i ) adopting an initial configuration of the force - free fields and ideal mhd fields respecting such co - rotation up to the light cylinder and with a suitable differential rotation outside that radius ; and ( ii ) choosing a transition layer at an appropriate distance inside the stellar surface .",
    "regarding the initial data , since the rotation induces a toroidal magnetic field we adopt initial data that has a toroidal magnetic defined as @xmath348 and also @xmath349 throughout domain .",
    "we also choose the mhd atmosphere to co - rotate with the star for @xmath350 , and not to rotate otherwise .",
    "both the location of the stellar surface and the density in the transition layer are dynamical .",
    "it is important that the choice of transition density @xmath351 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kernel ] ) respects the increasing density of the collapsing star . in order to maintain a consistent depth of the transition layer ,",
    "its position is adjusted as the star collapses by scaling the matching density @xmath351 in proportion to the peak density within the star : @xmath352 $ ] .",
    "the transition layer is displayed at the beginning and near the end of the collapse in fig .",
    "[ fig : collapse_rhoft ] . notice that with this conservative approach we are underestimating possible rotational effects .",
    "the angular frequency @xmath63 of magnetic field lines anchored near the rotation axis of the star is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : collapse_omegaf_alongline ] . from the initial condition ( in which constancy of @xmath63 is enforced ) ,",
    "a negative gradient in @xmath63 develops in the transition layer during the earliest stages of the collapse .",
    "this negative gradient has then disappeared by the time that the stellar angular velocity has increased by @xmath353 . above the initial value @xmath354",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : collapse_omegastar ] ) .",
    "from then on , the qualitative behavior obtained is consistent with the expected one : during the collapse , the star transfers angular momentum to the magnetic field lines so that @xmath355 near its surface , propagating along the magnetic field lines with a speed @xmath356 .",
    "the sharp negative gradient appearing in the last stages of the collapse reflects the strong radial gradient in @xmath357 that appears near the rotation axis , as well as the onset of strong general relativistic effects . as the event horizon arises ( prior to the formation of the apparent horizon at @xmath358 ) , it disconnects the interior from the exterior solution and causes @xmath63 to decrease , tending to the value @xmath229 expected by the blandford - znajek solution of a spinning black hole ."
