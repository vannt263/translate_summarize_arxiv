    "recently , volume holographic gratings with a modulation of both , the absorption coefficient and the refractive index , have attracted attention in various materials such as silver halide emulsions @xcite , doped garnet crystals @xcite or materials with colloidal color centers@xcite . the simplest theoretical description ( two - wave - coupling theory ) of light propagation in an isotropic medium with a periodic modulation of the ( complex ) dielectric constant",
    "was already given long ago by kogelnik @xcite .",
    "considering periodic phase and amplitude modulations , the grating types are treated to be _ in phase_. later guibelalde generalized the equations to be valid for _ out - of - phase _",
    "gratings @xcite .",
    "the quantity of major interest usually is the ( first order ) diffraction efficiency @xmath1 , defined as the ratio of powers between the diffracted beam and the incoming beam . for the case of high diffraction efficiencies ( above 50% ) or even for overmodulated gratings @xcite , the so called transmission efficiency @xmath2 , i.e. , more correctly termed as zero order diffraction efficiency , was also employed for characterization of the grating parameters .",
    "it was suggested , that by measuring the diffraction and transmission efficiency it is possible to evaluate the refractive - index modulation @xmath3 and the absorption constant modulation @xmath4 if one assumes in - phase gratings @xcite .    in this article",
    "we show how the shape of the angular dependencies for the @xmath0 first and zero order diffraction efficiencies depend characteristically on the parameters @xmath5 and the phase @xmath6 between them .",
    "we generalize the formulae given in ref .",
    "@xcite to the case of out - of - phase gratings and demonstrate at two experimental examples that the analysis is applicable .",
    "this is important , as up to now the evaluation of mixed gratings including a phase was only conducted by beam - coupling experiments , an interferometric technique which is more demanding from an experimental point of view .",
    "according to refs .",
    "@xcite a plane wave propagating in a ( thick ) medium with a one dimensional periodic complex dielectric constant , composed of its real part @xmath7 and imaginary part @xmath8 , yields outgoing complex electric field amplitudes for the ( zero order ) forward diffracted @xmath9 and ( first order ) diffracted @xmath10 waves .",
    "these depend characteristically on the following parameters : the mean absorption constant @xmath11 , the thickness @xmath12 of the grating , the dephasing @xmath13 due to the deviation from bragg s law and the complex coupling constant @xmath14 .",
    "further , @xmath15 denotes the spatial frequency of the grating , @xmath16 the mean refractive index of the medium , and @xmath6 a possible phase shift between the refractive - index and absorption grating .",
    "the goal of an experiment is to extract the grating parameters @xmath17 by varying the dephasing , e.g. , through measuring the angular response of @xmath18 and @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the complex conjugate and @xmath21 the incident intensity . for simplicity in calculations and",
    "as the most often used experimental setup we assume a symmetrical geometry , i.e. , that the grating vector and the surface normal are mutually perpendicular .",
    "a schematic of the setup is shown in figure [ fig : setup ] .    slightly adapting the convenient notation from ref .",
    "@xcite the efficiencies for transmission gratings can easily be calculated to yield @xmath22}-\\cos{\\left[z^{1/2}d\\sin{\\psi}\\right ] } \\right)\\\\ \\eta_0(\\theta)&=&\\frac{a(\\theta)}{2z } \\left ( ( z+\\vartheta^2 ) \\cosh{\\left[z^{1/2}d\\cos{\\psi}\\right]}+(z-\\vartheta^2 ) \\cos{\\left[z^{1/2}d\\sin{\\psi}\\right]}\\right .",

    "equations ( [ eq : de ] ) and ( [ eq : te ] ) are valid for @xmath27 ; for @xmath28 the angles and phase - shifts are replaced by their negative values , i.e. , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "note , that equation ( [ eq : de ] ) is identical to equation ( 11 ) from ref .",
    "@xcite . employing equations ( [ eq : de ] ) and ( [ eq : te ] ) we now study the particular case of @xmath31 and @xmath32 , i.e. , maximal grating strength for the amplitude contribution @xcite .",
    "we vary the strength of the phase grating between @xmath33 with different phase angles @xmath34 between the grating types .",
    "the angular dependencies of the zero order and @xmath0 first order diffraction efficiencies are depicted in figure 1(a)-(d ) .",
    "angular dependence of the zeroth and first orders diffraction efficiencies for increasing grating strength of the phase grating contribution .",
    "for all graphs : @xmath35,@xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "red thin lines : @xmath36 , blue lines : @xmath37 and green thick lines:@xmath38 with @xmath39 ( a ) , @xmath40 ( b ) , @xmath41 ( c ) , and @xmath42 .",
    "the dash - dot line indicates the mean absorption curve @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath44 are marked by vertical lines .",
    "note , that for @xmath45 the minus first order bragg peak completely disappears and the zero order peaks , too ( shown in ( c ) , blue lines ) ]    at this point let us summarize the main characteristic features occurring in the diffraction efficiencies at the example for @xmath40 to obtain a qualitative understanding of the curve shapes and their dependency on the ratio of @xmath46 :    * zero order diffraction efficiency @xmath47 * * the curves are symmetric with respect to normal incidence , i.e. , @xmath48 . * * neither the minima nor the maxima of the curve are located at the bragg angle , except for @xmath49 or @xmath50 or @xmath41 .",
    "in general the position and the height of the minima or maxima depend in a complex way on @xmath51 and even the mean absorption constant @xmath11 ( see discussion for @xmath52 ) . * * for @xmath53 the curve at the bragg angle extends more to the region above the mean absorption curve ( dash - dot line , first term in equations ( [ eq : de ] ) and ( [ eq : te ] ) ) than below , i.e. , as a simple approximation @xmath54 .",
    "the same is true vice versa for @xmath55 * * note , that for @xmath56 the curve resides below the mean absorption curve , for @xmath57 above * diffraction efficiency * * the maximum value of the diffraction efficiency differs for @xmath58 and @xmath59 ; in our case @xmath60 . * * the curves are symmetric with respect to @xmath26 , i.e. , @xmath61 except for their different mean absorption @xmath62 . * * note , that despite @xmath53 the diffraction efficiency @xmath63 for the minus first diffraction order , whereas it is vice versa for the plus first diffraction order , i.e. , @xmath64    next we would like to point out the difference between the curves for various @xmath6 values .",
    "figure [ fig : difftrans4](c ) shows a unique case which is most instructive . for @xmath41 the coupling constant @xmath65 .",
    "thus a maximum difference between @xmath66 and @xmath67 is obtained , culminating in the full depletion of @xmath66 if @xmath37 ( see appendix ) . finally , we want to draw the attention to the case of @xmath68",
    ". then @xmath69 gives identical results as for @xmath70 .",
    "the zero order diffraction efficiency @xmath2 , however , approaches the mean absorption curve for @xmath57 from above in the case of @xmath71 and contrary from below for @xmath72 . considering these arguments",
    "it is obvious , that only a simultaneous fit of all diffraction data , i.e. , zero and @xmath0 first order diffracted intensities , allows to extract the decisive parameters @xmath51 . on the other hand",
    "these curves are therefore fingerprints of the relation between the parameters .",
    "the following recipe can help in judging about the general situation ( for @xmath73 ) :    * check @xmath69 : if their magnitudes differ , this is a fingerprint that mixed gratings exist that are out of phase ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath75 at the bragg position obtains a maximum value for @xmath41 and for @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "* check @xmath2 : if @xmath76 then @xmath77 and else vice versa * if @xmath54 , the absorptive component is dominating and else vice versa . * for overmodulated phase gratings",
    "another feature of the diffraction efficiencies becomes prominent : the side minima near the bragg peak are lifted to nonzero values ( for @xmath78 ) .",
    "this striking feature can already be understood in the case @xmath39 where we simply add up the pure absorptive and the pure phase grating .",
    "the positions of the @xmath79 side minima are then given by @xmath80^{1/2}$ ] ( phase grating ) and @xmath81^{1/2}$ ] ( absorption grating ) .",
    "thus , their minima considerably deviate from each other for @xmath82 .",
    "recalling , that @xmath83 such a situation will practically occur if @xmath84 , i.e. , for @xmath85 ( overmodulated phase gratings exist ) .",
    "this is realized in various systems ( see e.g. , @xcite but did not deserve proper attention .",
    "finally , we would like to recall that for @xmath86 the complex coupling parameters @xmath87 are interchanged and thus the @xmath88 . for @xmath2 the term in the second line of equation [ eq : te ] changes sign because of @xmath89 .",
    "the investigations were performed on a pure congruently melted lithium niobate crystal ( thickness : @xmath90 ) .",
    "holographic transmission gratings were prepared by a standard two - wave mixing setup using an argon - ion laser at a recording wavelength of @xmath91 nm . two plane waves with equal intensities and parallel polarization states ( s - polarization ) were employed as recording beams under a crossing angle of @xmath92 ( outside the medium ) corresponding to a grating period of 1000 nm where the polar @xmath93-axis is lying in the plane of incidence .",
    "the total intensity of the writing beams was 9 mw/@xmath94 .",
    "hpdlc samples were fabricated from a uv curable mixture prepared from commercially available constituents as previously reported in literature @xcite .",
    "the grating period was 1216 nm , the grating thickness about @xmath95 m @xcite .",
    "after holographic recording we postcured the sample by illuminating it homogeneously with one of the uv writing beams .",
    "the grating characteristics of the samples was analyzed by monitoring the angular dependencies of the @xmath0 first and zero order diffraction efficiencies .",
    "for this purpose the samples were fixed on an accurately controlled rotation stage with an accuracy of @xmath96 ) and facultatively ( hpdlc ) in a heating chamber . in the case of @xmath97we used a single considerably reduced readout beam at @xmath98 nm and s - polarization , whereas for the hpdlc a he - ne laser beam at a readout wavelength of @xmath99 nm and p - polarization state was employed .",
    "angular dependence of the diffraction efficiencies for the zero and @xmath0 first orders of a grating recorded in a pure @xmath97sample .",
    "the unequal values of the first order diffraction efficiencies are an impressive signature for the existence of mixed phase and amplitude gratings that are out of phase .",
    "the zero order diffraction efficiency at the bragg angles show only a slight asymmetry with respect to @xmath26 because the diffraction efficiencies are small ( @xmath100 ) and the phase grating is by far dominating .",
    "the solid lines show a simultaneous fit to @xmath69 and @xmath2 .",
    "the dashed - dot line indicates the mean absorption curve . ]",
    "figure [ fig : linbo ] shows the experimental curves for the @xmath101 diffraction orders from a grating recorded in nominally pure congruently melted @xmath97 . according to the recipe given above we immediately can diagnose _ mixed out - of - phase _ refractive - index and amplitude gratings , because the @xmath102 .",
    "further by inspecting the zero order diffraction we come to know that the phase @xmath103 .",
    "the effects in the zero order are not so prominent for two reasons : the overall diffraction efficiency is very small and the phase grating is dominant because the zero order diffraction curve extends mostly to values below the mean absorption curve ( dash - dot line in figure [ fig : linbo ] )",
    ". a simultaneous fit of equations [ eq : de ] and [ eq : te ] to the measured data yielded the following parameters : @xmath104 with a reduced chi - square value of @xmath105 . from this value and figure",
    "[ fig : linbo ] it is obvious that the equations excellently fit the data .    finally , we intend to demonstrate the usability of the ( qualitative ) analysis employing an example with strong overmodulation and high extinction : holographic polymer - dispersed liquid crystals ( h - pdlcs ) .",
    "zeroth and @xmath0 first diffraction orders of a strongly overmodulated grating in hpdlc at 63@xmath106 celsius .",
    "@xmath107 m , @xmath108=543 nm , @xmath109 m ( same sample as used for the investigations in ref .",
    "the lower graphs show a simulation according to equations [ eq : de ] and [ eq : te ] .",
    "note , that here the mean extinction is already rather high . we do not expect that a fit could be successful for at least three reasons : ( 1 ) as in hpdlcs anisotropic gratings are formed , for the basic equations the full theory of montemezzani and zgonik should be employed @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) it can be noticed , that around @xmath48 more than two waves are propagating in the medium .",
    "therefore , also the two - wave coupling theory is not fully applicable .",
    "instead a rigorous coupled wave analysis should be performed @xcite .",
    "( 3 ) the gratings are expected to be inhomogeneous and non - sinusoidal @xcite , thus not completely fulfilling the requirements ]    only recently was a preliminary beam - coupling analysis of such a system conducted , a task which is not simple from an experimental point of view @xcite , in particular if the experiments should be carried out under high temperatures or application of external electric fields .",
    "figure [ fig : hpdlc ] shows the diffraction curves from a grating in a hpdlc at an elevated temperature .",
    "we can understand the major characteristic features as follows : the liquid crystal ( lc ) component in an hpdlc is highly birefringent .",
    "statistical alignment of the lc - droplets of about the light wavelength s size leads to strong scattering , i.e. , extinction which can be treated similar to absorption provided that multiple scattering does not play an essential role .",
    "hpdlcs basically consist of alternating regions with high and low concentration of lcs embedded in a polymer matrix .",
    "thus , these periodically varying scatterers act as extinction gratings .",
    "in addition , of course , also the refractive index is strongly modulated ( at least via the density changes ) .",
    "therefore , hpdlcs are typical examples of mixed gratings .",
    "furthermore , it is well known in literature that the light - induced refractive - index changes are extremely high and strong overmodulation occurs ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "such an example is shown in figure [ fig : hpdlc ] . from the experimental data we conclude , that combined refractive - index and extinction gratings are produced .",
    "this is consistent with our previous beam - coupling measurements @xcite .",
    "however , we do not dare to decide about a possible phase between them .",
    "a quantitative evaluation is not possible for this case as we are aware of the fact , that in hpdlcs the gratings are anisotropic and thus the basic equations of ref .",
    "@xcite should be replaced by the full equations given by montemezzani and zgonik @xcite .",
    "in addition , the gratings are usually rather inhomogeneous across the sample but might be considerably improved upon further efforts during recording @xcite .",
    "the non - zero minima in the diffracted beams partially might originate from overmodulation as discussed above but mainly from the inhomogeneity of the gratings and a profile perpendicular to the grating vector @xcite .",
    "however , a qualitative understanding of the changes occuring during heating or applying an electric field can still be read off from the diffraction curves like those shown in ref . @xcite .",
    "the above discussed analysis is easily applicable for @xmath110 and @xmath111 , so that with the chosen example of @xmath97above we are already at the limit .",
    "if one grating type is dominant the analysis still remains valid , however , the resulting values for @xmath6 and the smaller component result in quite large errors .",
    "we would like to draw the attention to the fact , that for @xmath112 the absorptive grating strength is considerably limited , so that in general the zero order diffraction will not feel the bragg diffraction . on the other hand , for @xmath52 , the forward diffracted beam will exhibit a maximum near the bragg position , a fact which is well known in x - ray optics ( anomalous transmission ) , see e.g. @xcite",
    ".    we would like to point out , that the analysis of only the first diffraction orders can not give the full information on all relevant parameters @xcite .",
    "however , it is sufficient to use the @xmath0 first together with the zero order diffraction and to avoid more demanding beam - coupling ( interferometric ) experiments .",
    "a prospective phase between the grating and the interference pattern@xcite , however , can not be determined by simple diffraction experiments .",
    "we further would like to emphasize , that the limitations of the coupled wave equations according to ref .",
    "@xcite should be kept in mind when employing equations [ eq : de ] and [ eq : te ] , e.g. , it is assumed that the gratings are planar , purely sinusoidal and isotropic ( for anisotropic gratings the theory given in ref .",
    "@xcite should be employed ) , @xmath113 ( for violation of this condition see @xcite ) and only two beams are kept in the coupling scheme .",
    "if the latter is not applicable the theory of rigorous coupled waves has to be applied @xcite , naturally with an increase of the number of coupling constants between the beams and thus with loss of simplicity .",
    "we are grateful to profs . th .",
    "woike and m. imlau for providing the @xmath97sample .",
    "financially supported by the austrian science fund ( p-18988 ) and the ad in the frame of the stc program slovenia - austria ( si - a4/0708 ) .",
    "we acknowledge continuous support by e. tillmanns by making one of his labs available to us .",
    "for the particular case of @xmath41 the diffraction efficiencies read : @xmath114\\\\ z&=&\\vartheta^2 + 4(\\kappa_1 ^ 2-\\kappa_2 ^ 2)\\nonumber.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it s interesting to note , that for this case the diffracted and forward diffracted beams have the functional dependence of pure phase gratings with an effective coupling constant of @xmath115^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "the amplitude of the diffracted beams , however , is enhanced or diminished by a multiplication with or division by @xmath116 , respectively .",
    "therefore , it s easy to see that for @xmath37 the curves shown in figure [ fig : difftrans4 ] ( c ) arise .",
