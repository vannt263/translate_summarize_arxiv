    "chirality is a common property of molecules .",
    "[ f : chiralmol ] shows a simple example .",
    "the 2-iodubutene contains a stereo center - the c atom - , to which the four different groups are attached .",
    "if one selects the bond to the group ch@xmath1ch@xmath2 , the three groups i , h , ch@xmath1 form a right - handed or a left - handed screw .",
    "these two `` enatiomers '' are related to each other by mirror reflection .",
    "complex bio - molecules are all chiral .",
    "chirality is very obvious for the dna double - helix .",
    "although in principle two entantiomers exist , which have exactly the same binding energy , organisms synthesize only one .",
    "the reason is that the dna blueprint provides only for one .",
    "since the function of bio - molecules depends critical on their geometry , ( e.g. the key - lock mechanism of enzymes ) the other enantiomer with the mirror - geometry may not function in the organism .",
    "life based on the opposite enantiomers of all bio - molecules should be possible .",
    "how came the choice about in the beginning of evolution ?",
    "most likely , it was just by accident",
    ". however , there are speculations that the chirality of elementary particles might have played a role .    fig .",
    "[ f : chiralpart ] illustrates chirality of a mass - less particle .",
    "the spin can be parallel or anti - parallel to particle momentum .",
    "since the spin of the particle is an axial vector , it defines the a sense of rotation and the two orientations correspond to a right - handed and a left - handed system .",
    "the neutrinos , which appear only as left - handed species , introduce chiral asymmetry into the world .",
    "the chirality of molecules is of geometrical nature , the chirality of mass - less particles is dynamical .",
    "nuclei have been thought as being achiral , because they consist of only two species of nucleons and have relatively simple shapes as compared to molecules , however , meng and frauendorf @xcite recently pointed out that angular momentum adds a new dimension , such that the rotation of triaxial nuclei may attain a chiral character .",
    "the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ f : sym ] illustrates this surprising possibility .",
    "we denote the three principal axes ( pa ) of triaxial density distribution by l , i , and s , which stand for long , intermediate and short , respectively .",
    "the angular momentum  vector @xmath3 introduces chirality by selecting one of the octants . in four of the octants",
    "the axes l , i , and s form a left - handed and in the other four a right - handed system .",
    "this gives rise to two degenerate rotational bands because all octants are energetically equivalent .",
    "hence the chirality of nuclear rotation results from a combination of dynamics ( the angular momentum ) and geometry ( the triaxial shape ) .",
    "if we speak about the shape of a nucleus , we mean the shape of its density distribution .",
    "the symmetry of the density distribution -spherical or deformed- decides if the spectrum will be irregular or show rotational bands .",
    "the density distribution is found by means of mean field approaches , like the various types of the hartree - fock calculations or the strutinsky method . for large angular momentum one has to use the cranking generalizations of these methods , which describe an uniformly rotating mean field .",
    "in these studies , one used to assume that the axis of uniform rotation coincides with one of the principal axes of the density distribution , as it its the case for molecules .",
    "frauendorf @xcite demonstrated that nuclei are different from molecules .",
    "they may uniformly rotate about an axis that is tilted with respect to the principal axes of the density distribution .",
    "the tilted axis cranking model ( tac ) @xcite allow us to calculate the orientation of the rotational axis .",
    "tac consist in applying one of mean field approximations to the two - body routhian @xmath4 here , @xmath5 is the two - body hamiltonian of choice and @xmath6 the angular momentum component along the z - axis which is the rotational axis .",
    "the new element as compared to traditional cranking calculations is to allow for all orientations of the density distribution with respect to the z - axis .",
    "[ f : sym ] illustrates how changing the orientation of the rotational axis leads to different discrete symmetries , which show up in the level sequence of rotational bands . in the upper panel",
    "the axis of rotation ( which is chosen to be z ) coincides with one of the pa , i. e. the finite rotation @xmath7 .",
    "this symmetry implies the signature quantum number @xmath8 , which restricts the total angular momentum  to the values @xmath9 , with @xmath10 integer ( @xmath11 band ) @xcite . in the middle panel",
    "the rotational axis lies in one of the planes spanned by two pa ( planar tilt ) . since now @xmath12",
    ", there is no longer a restriction of the values @xmath13 can take .",
    "the band is a sequence of states the @xmath13 of which differ by 1 ( @xmath14 band ) .",
    "there is a second symmetry in the upper two panels : the rotation @xmath15 transforms the density into an identical position but changes the sign of the angular momentum  vector @xmath3 . since the latter is odd under the time reversal operation @xmath16 , the combination @xmath17 .    in the lower panel",
    "the axis of rotation is out of the three planes spanned by the pa . the operation @xmath18 .",
    "it changes the chirality of the axes l , i and s with respect to the axis of rotation @xmath3 .",
    "since the left- and the right - handed solutions have a the same energy , they give rise to two degenerate @xmath14 bands .",
    "they are the linear combinations of the left- and right - handed , which restore the spontaneously broken @xmath19 symmetry .    fig .",
    "[ f : orb ] illustrates how such a solution may arise .",
    "the proton aligns its angular momentum @xmath20 with the short axis of the density distribution .",
    "this orientation maximizes the overlap of its orbital with the triaxial density , which corresponds to minimal energy , because the core - particle interaction is attractive .",
    "the neutron hole aligns its angular momentum @xmath21 with the long axis .",
    "this orientation minimizes the overlap of its orbital with the triaxial density , which corresponds to minimal energy , because the core - hole interaction is repulsive .",
    "the angular momentum of the core @xmath22 is of collective nature .",
    "it likes to orient along the intermediate axis , which has the largest moment of inertia , because the density distribution deviates strongest from rotational symmetry with respect to this axis .",
    "the chiral configuration is rather special .",
    "the shape must be triaxial , and there must be high - j particles and high - j holes .",
    "the existence of such a structures and their location in the nuclear chart must by studied by means of microscopic tac calculations .",
    "the status of these explorations will be discussed in the last section .",
    "dimitrov , frauendorf and dnau @xcite found the first completely self - consistent chiral solution for @xmath23pr@xmath24 with the maximal triaxiality of @xmath25 .",
    "[ f : expsys ] shows that in this nucleus two @xmath14 bands , which are based on the @xmath26 $ ] configuration , merge forming a doublet structure @xcite .",
    "consistent with the experiment , the tac solution attains chiral character only for @xmath27 .",
    "pairs of close bands with the same parity are found in the neighboring odd - odd nuclei as well @xcite .",
    "[ f : expsys ] shows as examples the isotones of@xmath23pr@xmath24 .",
    "the bands are close but do not merge .",
    "this means that the chirality can not be broken in a static way as in molecules .",
    "there must be substantial tunneling between the left- and right handed configurations . as we discuss in the next section",
    ", the a weaker form of chirality may occur as a slow motion of the angular momentum vector into the left- and right handed sectors .",
    "the frequency of such a chiral vibration is less than 300 kev ( cf .",
    "[ f : expsys ] ) . in this respect ,",
    "breaking of chiral symmetry is similar to breaking reflection symmetry by octupole deformation .",
    "the two branches of opposite parity do not completely merge into one rotational band ( see e.g. @xcite .    for most molecules tunneling between the two enatiomers",
    "is negligible ; for complex molecules the tunneling time easily exceeds the age of the universe .",
    "we can separate the left - handed from the right - handed enantiomers ( or other organisms do it for us ) and can experiment with one specie .",
    "the turning of the polarization plane of light by organic sugar is a familiar example .",
    "the effect is caused by the chiral arrangement of the optical active atoms in the molecule . in nuclei , chirality is harder to demonstrate , because of the rapid motion between the left- and right - handed configurations .",
    "therefore , one has to understand this motion . a microscopic description of this large amplitude motion is not yet available for the interpretation of the experiment .",
    "however , we may gain insight into the dynamics by further studying the particle - rotor model , in the context of which the possibility that rotating triaxial nuclei may become chiral was conceived @xcite .",
    "the simplest chiral configuration is illustrated in fig .",

    "whose individual angular momenta are aligned with the s- and l - axes .",

    "[ f : orb ] .",
    "a @xmath0 band is generated by adding the rotor momentum @xmath31 in the s - l plane ( planar tilt ) .",
    "there is a second @xmath0 band representing a vibration of @xmath32 out of the s - l plane , which is generated by a wobbling of @xmath31 .",
    "this is a more precise description of the chiral vibration mentioned above .",
    "higher in the band , @xmath31 reorients toward the i - axis , which has the maximal moment of inertia . the left- and the right - handed positions of @xmath32 separate . since they couple only by some tunneling ,",
    "the two bands come very close together in energy .",
    "this is the regime we called chiral rotation . the reorientation of @xmath31 , i. e. the transition from chiral vibration to rotation is well localized in the spectrum fig .",

    "the symmetry axis of the spheroid is parallel to the 2-axis at @xmath38 .",
    "its position defines a critical . if @xmath39 , the axis lies outside the angular momentum sphere . as seen in the upper panel , the lowest energy correspond to the touching point of the sphere and spheroid , which is marked by the star .",

    "[ f : sep ] , at the minimal energy , the energy spheroid touches the sphere from inside at the _ two _ symmetric points marked by the stars . for somewhat larger energy ,",
    "the spheroid penetrates the sphere , which gives rise to two separate orbits around the two points of minimal energy .",

    "nevertheless , the quantal calculation shows that the splitting between the bands is very small ( cf .",
    "[ f : pr ] ) and that the wavefunction is concentrated around the minima of the classical energy .",
    "tunneling is determined by _ the ratio of the barrier height and the mass coefficient_. the mass coefficient is small enough such that the tunneling through the low barrier is strongly reduced .",
