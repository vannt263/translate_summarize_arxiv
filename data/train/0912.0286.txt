    "<S> therefore , the implementation of a quantum interface between the polarization state of a single photon and a two - level system requires the cavity mode to be polarization - degenerate . </S>",
    "<S> a second problem is that the cavity resonance frequency and the frequency of the two - level system , in our case semiconductor self - assembled quantum dots , must be matched with a precision which is currently impossible to obtain deterministically in the fabrication process . </S>",

    "<S> we will show that this technique permits control of the frequencies of the two polarization modes almost independently of one another , providing a tuning range of a few angstroms .    </S>",
    "<S> the technique is based on the creation of a permanent defect on the surface of the sample near the cavity by means of a strongly focused laser beam ( see fig .  [ figure ] , upper figure ) . </S>",
    "<S> the sample locally melts , creating a hole with some material accumulated on the edges . </S>",

    "<S> its polarization dependence is characterized by placing an analyzer consisting of a fixed linear polarizer and a rotating half - wave plate in front of the spectrometer , so that the polarization state in the spectrometer is constant and the measurements are not affected by the polarization response of the grating .    </S>",
    "<S> the spectral splitting of the two polarization modes is typically around few ghz , which is smaller than the spectral width of the mode and comparable to the spectrometer resolution . </S>",

    "<S> 1 ) , close to the cavity center , the splitting is reduced from @xmath29 ghz to @xmath30 ghz . </S>",
    "<S> a second hole ( 2 ) did not lead to a strong reduction . </S>",
    "<S> after burning two more holes on the edge of the eastern trench ( holes ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , each one for one minute ) , the splitting is reduced to @xmath31 ghz .    </S>",
    "<S> more tests were performed on a new cavity in order to understand how the spectrum of the two peaks changes when a hole is burnt at different positions ( see fig .  2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the results are illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 , where the central wavelengths of the two polarization peaks ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) are plotted on the horizontal and vertical axes . </S>",
    "<S> each point on the graph corresponds to a hole burnt on the sample . </S>",
    "<S> first , eight holes were burnt between the southern and western trenches , starting farther from and moving closer to the cavity centers , and then six more holes were burnt between the northern and the eastern trenches continuing in the same direction ( along the @xmath34 $ ] crystal lattice orientation ) . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the first few holes is to reduce the spectral splitting of the two polarization modes , reaching a minimum of @xmath35 ghz . </S>",
    "<S> after that , @xmath33 remains approximately constant , while @xmath32 increases . </S>",
    "<S> the closer the holes are burnt with respect to the center , the larger the frequency shift . </S>",
    "<S> due to the combined effect of the @xmath36 holes burnt along this direction , @xmath37 becomes @xmath38 ghz and the two peaks can be clearly resolved ( inset in fig .  3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> burning holes along the orthogonal direction , @xmath33 changes much faster than @xmath32 . by adjusting the hole orientation and distance from the center </S>",
    "<S> , we have a way to tune almost independently the frequency of the two polarization modes with a range of about @xmath39 ghz .    </S>",
    "<S> this effect can be explained by a simple model , based on the tensorial relationship between stress , strain and the optical properties of the material ( see appendix a ) . </S>",
    "<S> essentially , the anisotropic component of the stress changes the splitting and the isotropic component affects the absolute frequencies of the two submodes . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we find that for @xmath40 holes burnt along the @xmath41 direction : @xmath42 which corresponds to a straight line with slope @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath44 and @xmath45 are quantities which depend on the tensorial elastic ( @xmath46 ) and elasto - optic ( @xmath47 ) coefficients of the material ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) . for the holes burnt along the @xmath50 direction we find a similar linear relationship with inverted slope @xmath51 . as can be seen in fig .  3 </S>",
    "<S> , the data fit quite well with this model : the fitted slope for the lines is @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> literature values for the bulk gaas and alas thermal and elasto - optic properties @xcite give a slope of around @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> however , we do not expect these values to be perfectly compatible since our model does not take into account the bimorphic structure formed by the oxidized alas layer and by the dbr mirrors .    </S>",
    "<S> the cavity resonance frequency and polarization splitting for holes burnt at room temperature were measured at @xmath54 k , showing values significantly different from the room - temperature ones . </S>",
    "<S> we repeated the hole - burning process directly at low - temperature , increasing the burning laser power to @xmath55 mw ( @xmath56 nm ) . </S>",
    "<S> polarization degeneracy could be achieved as well as frequency tuning , albeit with a different slope @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> the stability of the effects was tested by warming up and cooling down the device a few times : a difference of the order of @xmath58 was found for the first cooldown after burning ( consistent with the results in @xcite ) , while the deviation in the splitting is within @xmath59 ghz for the successive cool - downs .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we introduced a technique to permanently tune the polarization and spectral properties of optical micropillar cavities . by laser - burning a small defect on the sample surface near the cavity </S>",
    "<S> , we can induce a controllable amount of birefringence in the structure . by adjusting the position of the defect </S>",
    "<S> , we control the central wavelengths of the two polarization submodes of the fundamental cavity mode . </S>",
    "<S> this technique enables the implementation of polarization - degenerate semiconductor micropillars for quantum information processing and it may find applications for fine tuning of other kinds of semiconductor microcavities whose optical properties are influenced by material strain , such as photonic crystal defect cavities and microdisk cavities .    </S>",
