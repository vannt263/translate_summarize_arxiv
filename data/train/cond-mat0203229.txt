    "single wall carbon nanotubes ( swnts ) are basically rolled graphite sheets , which are characterized by two integers @xmath0 defining the rolling vector of graphite.@xcite therefore , electronic properties of swnts , at first order , can be deduced from that of graphene by mapping the band structure of 2d hexagonal lattice on a cylinder.@xcite such analysis indicates that the @xmath1 armchair nanotubes are always metal and exhibit one dimensional quantum conduction  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 zigzag nanotubes are generally semiconductor and only are metal if @xmath3 is an integer multiple of three .",
    "however , recent experiments@xcite indicate much more complicated structural dependence of the band gap and electronic properties of swnts . the semiconducting behavior of swnts has been of particular interest ,",
    "since the electronic properties can be controlled by doping or implementing defects in a nanotube - based optoelectronic devices.@xcite it is therefore desirable to have a good understanding of electronic and structural properties of swnts and the interrelations between them .",
    "band calculations of swnts were initially performed by using a oneband @xmath4orbital tight binding model.@xcite subsequently , experimental data  @xcite on the band gaps were extrapolated to confirm the inverse proportionality with the radius of the nanotube.@xcite later , first principles calculation  @xcite within local density approximation ( lda ) showed that the @xmath5@xmath6 hybridization becomes significant at small @xmath7 ( or at high curvature ) .",
    "such an effect were not revealed by the @xmath4orbital tight - binding bands .",
    "recent analytical studies  @xcite showed the importance of curvature effects in carbon nanotubes",
    ". nonetheless , band calculations performed by using different methods have been at variance on the values of the band gap .",
    "while recent studies predict interesting effects , such as strongly local curvature dependent chemical reactivity  @xcite , an extensive theoretical analysis of the curvature effects on geometric and electronic structure has not been carried out so far .    in this paper , we present a systematic ab - initio analysis of the band structure of zigzag swnts showing interesting curvature effects .",
    "our analysis includes a large number of zigzag swnts with @xmath3 ranging from 4 to 15 .",
    "the fully optimized structural and electronic properties of swnts are obtained from extensive first - principle calculations within the generalized gradient approximation@xcite ( gga ) by using pseudopotential planewave method  @xcite .",
    "we used plane waves up to an energy of 500 ev and ultrasoft pseudopotentials  @xcite .",

    "first , we discuss effects of curvature on structural parameters such as bond lengths and angles . figure  [ fig : zigzagstr ] shows a schematic side view of a zigzag swnt which indicates two types of cc bonds and ccc bond angles , respectively .",
    "the curvature dependence of the fully optimized structural parameters of zigzag swnts are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : idstr ] .",
    "the variation of the normalized bond lengths ( _ i.e. _ @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the optimized cc bond length in graphene ) and the bond angles with tube radius @xmath7 ( or @xmath3 ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : idstr]a and b , respectively . both the bond lengths and",
    "the bond angles display a monotonic variation and approach the graphene values as the radius increases .",
    "as pointed out earlier for the armchair swnts  @xcite , the curvature effects , however , become significant at small radii . the zigzag bond angle ( @xmath9 )",
    "decreases with decreasing radius .",
    "it is about @xmath13 less than @xmath14 , namely the bond angle between @xmath15 bonds of the graphene , for the @xmath16 swnt , the smallest tube we studied .",
    "the length of the corresponding zigzag bonds ( @xmath8 ) , on the other hand , increases with decreasing @xmath7 . on the other hand ,",
    "the length of the parallel bond ( @xmath17 ) decreases to a lesser extent with decreasing @xmath7 , and the angle involving this bond ( @xmath10 ) is almost constant .     and",

    "an internal strain is implemented upon the formation of tubular structure from the graphene sheet .",
    "the associated strain energy , which is specified as the curvature energy , @xmath20 , is calculated as the difference of total energy per carbon atom between the bare swnt and the graphene ( _ i.e. _ @xmath22 ) for @xmath23 . the calculated curvature energies are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : idstr]c .",
    "as expected @xmath24 is positive and increases with increasing curvature .",
    "consequently , the binding ( or cohesive ) energy of carbon atom in a swnt decrease with increasing curvature . we note that in the classical theory of elasticity the curvature energy is given by the following expression  @xcite @xmath25 here @xmath26 is the young s modulus , @xmath27 is the thickness of the tube , and @xmath28 is the atomic volume .",
    "interestingly , the ab - initio curvature energies yield a perfect fit to the relation @xmath29 as seen in fig .  [",

    "this simple picture provides a qualitative understanding , but fails to describe some important features , in particular for small radius or _",
    "metallic _ nanotubes .",
    "this is clearly shown in table  [ table : ideg ] , where the band gaps calculated in the present study are summarized and compared with results obtained from other methods in the literature .",
    "for example , our calculations result in small but non - zero energy band gaps of 93 , 78 and 28 mev for @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 swnts , respectively ( see table  1 ) .",
    "recently , these gaps are measured by scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) experiments  @xcite as 80 , 42 and 29 mev , in the same order .",
    "the biggest discrepancy noted in table  [ table : ideg ] is between the tight - binding and the first - principles values of the gaps for small radius tubes such as @xmath37 .",
    "these results indicate that curvature effects are important and the simple zone folding picture has to be improved . moreover , the analysis of the lda bands of the @xmath38 swnt calculated by blase _",
    "@xcite brought another important effect of the curvature .",
    "the antibonding singlet @xmath6 and @xmath5 states mix and repel each other in curved graphene . as a result",
    ", the purely @xmath6 state of planar graphene is lowered with increasing curvature . for zigzag swnts ,",
    "the energy of this singlet @xmath6state is shifted downwards with decreasing @xmath7 ( or increasing curvature ) . here , we extended the analysis of blase _",
    "@xcite to the @xmath2 swnts with @xmath23 by performing gga calculations .",
    "states ( vb ) , the double degenerate @xmath6states ( cb ) and the singlet @xmath6state as a function of nanotube radius .",
    "each data point corresponds to @xmath3 ranging from 4 to 15 consecutively .",

    "[ fig : idband]a , we show the double degenerate @xmath4states ( which are the valence band edge at the @xmath33point ) , the double degenerate @xmath6states ( which become the conduction band edge at @xmath33 for large @xmath7 ) , and the singlet @xmath6state ( which is in the conduction band for large @xmath7 ) .",
    "as seen , the shift of the singlet @xmath6state is curvature dependent , and below a certain radius determines the band gap . for tubes with radius greater than 3.3  ( _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath39 ) , the energy of the singlet @xmath6state at the @xmath33point of the bz is above the doubly degenerate @xmath6 states ( _ i.e. _ bottom of the conduction band ) , while it falls between the valence and conduction band edges for @xmath40 , and eventually dips even below the double degenerate valence band @xmath4states for the zigzag swnt with radius less than 2.7  ( _ i.e. _ @xmath41 ) .",
    "therefore , all the zigzag tubes with radius less than 2.7  are metallic . for @xmath40 , the edge of the conduction band",
    "is made by the singlet @xmath6state , but not by the double degenerate @xmath6state .",
    "the band gap derived from the zone folding scheme is reduced by the shift of this singlet @xmath6state as a result of curvature induced @xmath42 mixing .",
    "this explains why the tight binding calculations predict band gaps around 1  ev for @xmath40 tubes while the self - consistent calculations predict much smaller value .",
    "another issue we next address is the variation of the band gap , @xmath43 , as a function of tube radius .",
    "based on @xmath4orbital tight binding model , it was proposed  @xcite that @xmath43 behaves as @xmath44 which is independent from helicity . within the simple @xmath4orbital tight binding model , @xmath45 is taken to be equal to the hopping matrix element @xmath46 .",
    "( @xmath12 is the bond length in graphene ) .",

    "[ fig : idband]b , the band gap displays a rather oscillatory behavior up to radius 6.0  . the relation given in eq .",
    "[ gap1r ] was obtained by a second order taylor expansion of one - electron eigenvalues of @xmath4-orbital tight binding model  @xcite around the @xmath32point of the bz , and hence it fails to represent the effect of the helicity . by extending the taylor expansion to the next higher order , yorikawa and",
    "muramatsu  @xcite included another term in the empirical expression of the band gap variation , @xmath47 , \\label{gap1r2}\\ ] ] which depends on the chiral angle , @xmath48 , as well as an index @xmath49 . here",
    "@xmath50 is a constant and the index @xmath49 is defined as the integer from @xmath51 .",
    "the factor @xmath52 comes from the fact that the allowed @xmath53 is nearest to either the @xmath32- or @xmath54- point of the hexagonal brillouin zone . for zigzag",
    "nanotubes studied here , the chiral angle is zero , so the second term just gives @xmath55 dependence as @xmath56 .",
    "hence , the solid lines in fig .  [ fig : idband]b are fits to the empirical expression , @xmath57 , obtained from eq .  [ gap1r2 ] for @xmath580 by using the parameters @xmath59 ev and @xmath60 .",
    "the experimental data obtained by sts  @xcite are shown by open diamonds in the same figure .",
    "the agreement between our calculations and the experimental data is very good considering the fact that there might be some uncertainties in identifying the nanotube ( _ i.e. _ assignment of @xmath0 indices ) in the experiment .",
    "the fit of this data to the empirical expression given by eq .",
    "[ gap1r ] are also presented by a dashed line for comparison .",
    "the situation displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : idband ] indicates that the variation of the band gap with the radius is not simply @xmath61 , but additional terms incorporating the chirality dependence are required .",
    "most importantly , the mixing of the singlet @xmath6state with the the singlet @xmath5state due to the curvature , and its shift towards the valence band with increasing curvature is not included in neither the @xmath4orbital tight binding model , nor the empirical relations expressed by eq .  [ gap1r ] and [ gap1r2 ] .",
    "this behavior of the singlet @xmath6states is of particular importance for the applied radial deformation that modifies the curvature and in turn induces metallization  @xcite .    in conclusion",
    ", we investigated structural and electronic properties that result from the tubular nature of the swnts .",
    "the first - principles total energy calculations indicated that significant amount of strain energy is implemented in a swnt when the radius is small .",
    "however , the elastic properties can be still described by the classical theory of elasticity .",
    "we showed how the singlet @xmath62state in the conduction band of a zigzag tube moves and eventually enters in the band gap between the doubly degenerate @xmath62-conduction and @xmath4-valence bands . as a result , the energy band structure and",
