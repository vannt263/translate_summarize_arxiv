    "first assume that @xmath87 then by ( [ eq : cd ] ) , a stationary point of @xmath75 is given by @xmath88 and we obtain @xmath28 in the form @xmath89 since @xmath90 conditions ( [ eq : conditions ] ) are not satisfied ; however , it is easy to check that they are satisfied if @xmath91 for all such @xmath92 the polynomial @xmath93 is a valid choice for problem ( [ eq : cond1 ] ) , yielding @xmath94 the polynomial @xmath93 was used by mceliece _",
    "_ @xcite and kabatiansky and levenshtein @xcite to derive their well known upper bounds on codes .",
    "so far in our optimization we did not use the condition @xmath80 to use it , let us write @xmath96 and repeat the above calculation .",
    "we find that stationary points of @xmath75 should satisfy @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the moment functional with respect to the distribution @xmath99 a stationary point of @xmath100 is given by the reproducing kernel @xmath101 _ with respect to this distribution _ : @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the corresponding orthonormal system . to find the polynomials @xmath104 observe that @xmath105 is satisfied for @xmath106 indeed , if @xmath107 then the function @xmath108 is in the subspace spanned by @xmath109 and thus is orthogonal to @xmath110 to conclude , the function sought can be taken in the form @xmath111      in this case we seek the polynomial in the form @xmath113 the necessary condition for the stationary point takes the form @xmath114 .",
    "from this , @xmath115 where the kernel @xmath116 is taken with respect to the distribution @xmath117 the corresponding orthogonal polynomials @xmath118 are also easily found : up to normalization they are equal @xmath119 then @xmath120 let @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) be the largest root of @xmath123 ( resp . of @xmath124 ) .",
    "then @xmath125 if @xmath126 and @xmath127 if @xmath128      \\1 . the polynomials @xmath129 were constructed and applied to coding theory by levenshtein @xcite .",
    "polynomials closely related to them were studied in a more general context in the works of m.  g.  krein _ et al . _ ; see krein and nudelman @xcite .",
    "the orthogonal systems @xmath130 are sometimes called _ adjacent polynomials _ of the original system @xmath131    \\2 .",
    "the stationary points found above are not true extremums because the second differential of the functionals @xmath132 is indefinite : for instance , @xmath133 .",
    "nevertheless , the polynomials @xmath129 have been proved @xcite to be optimal in the following sense : for any @xmath134 and all @xmath135 @xmath136        this section is devoted to a different way of constructing polynomials for the delsarte problem .",
    "the ideas discussed below originate in the work of c.  bachoc @xcite . they were elaborated upon in an earlier work of the authors @xcite .",
    "we develop the remark made after ( [ eq : cd ] ) , namely that for any @xmath139 @xmath140 is an eigenfunction of the jacobi operator @xmath141 since @xmath142 is a good choice for the polynomial in delsarte s problem , it is possible to construct polynomials as eigenvectors of @xmath54 as opposed to the analytic arguments discussed above . in particular , @xmath142 arises as an eigenfunction of the operator @xmath143 defined by @xmath144 where @xmath145 indeed , using ( [ eq : kk ] ) and ( [ eq : cd ] ) we obtain @xmath146 on account of earlier arguments we should choose the polynomial for problem ( [ eq : cond1 ] ) in the form @xmath147 where @xmath148 is an eigenfunction of @xmath149 the positive definiteness condition of @xmath28 can be proved using the perron - frobenius theorem ; for this we must take @xmath28 to be the eigenfunction that corresponds to the _ largest _ eigenvalue of @xmath149 this condition defines the range of code distances @xmath150 in which the method is applicable .",
    "a variant of this calculation was performed in @xcite to which we refer for details .",
    "the difference between @xcite and the argument above is that there we took @xmath151 this has the advantage of defining @xmath152 independently of @xmath150 but leads to a bound of the form @xmath153 which is generally somewhat weaker than ( [ eq : mrrw ] ) . using the function @xmath154 defined above we can improve this to recover the estimate ( [ eq : mrrw ] ) .",
    "we note that this argument does not depend on the choice of the functional space ; in particular , the kernels @xmath155 arise if the operator @xmath54 is written with respect to the basis of the corresponding adjacent polynomials ( @xmath156 or @xmath157 ) and their generating distribution . to conclude , levenshtein s polynomials and bounds on codes can be derived within the framework of the spectral method .",
    "consider again example [ example]@xmath42 .",
    "the adjacent polynomials up to a constant factor that does not depend on @xmath10 are given by @xcite @xmath158 where @xmath159 for instance denotes the degree-@xmath10 normalized krawtchouk polynomial associated with the @xmath160-dimensional hamming space .",
    "the jacobi matrix @xmath38 for the basis @xmath161 can be computed from ( [ eq : ai ] ) as follows .",
    "since @xmath162 we find that the coefficients of three - term recurrence for the family @xmath163 are @xmath164 constructing the operator @xmath152 as described above , we obtain @xmath165 as its eigenfunction .",
    "a similar construction can be pursued for the function @xmath166    the approach outlined above has two advantages .",
    "first , it enables one to obtain simple estimates of the largest eigenvalue of @xmath54 which is important in verifying the condition @xmath167.$ ] the second advantage is a more substantial one : this method can be extended to the case of _ multivariate zonal polynomials _ when the analytic alternative is not readily available .",
    "this case arises when the space @xmath0 is homogeneous but not 2-point homogeneous",
    ". worked examples include the real grassmann manifold @xmath168 ( @xcite ; the @xmath169 are given by the generalized @xmath31-variate jacobi polynomials ) and the so - called ordered hamming space @xcite .",
    "we provide a few more details on the latter case in order to illustrate the general method .",
    "let @xmath170 be a finite alphabet of size @xmath171 consider the set @xmath172 of vectors of dimension @xmath173 over @xmath170 .",
    "a vector @xmath174 will be written as a concatenation of @xmath43 blocks of length @xmath175 each , @xmath176 for a given vector @xmath174 let @xmath177 be the number of @xmath175-blocks of @xmath174 whose rightmost nonzero entry is in the @xmath10th position counting from the beginning of the block .",
    "the @xmath175-vector @xmath178 will be called the _ shape _ of @xmath174 .",
    "a shape vector @xmath178 defines a partition of a number @xmath179 into a sum of @xmath175 parts .",
    "let @xmath180 let @xmath181 be the set of all such partitions .",
    "the zonal polynomials associated to @xmath172 are @xmath175-variate polynomials @xmath182 of degree @xmath183 .",
    "they are orthogonal on @xmath184 according to the following inner product @xmath185 the weight in this relation is given by the multinomial probability distribution @xmath186 so the polynomials @xmath187 form a particular case of _ r - variate krawtchouk polynomials_.    let @xmath188 be a vector of shape @xmath189 . define a norm on @xmath172 by setting @xmath190 and let @xmath191 be the ordered hamming metric ( known also as the niederreiter - rosenbloom - tsfasman metric ) .",
    "we note that in the multivariate case there is no direct link between the variables and the metric .",
    "for instance , for the space @xmath172 the polynomials ( as well as relations in the corresponding association scheme ) are naturally indexed by shape vectors @xmath189 while the weight is some function @xmath192    the delsarte theorem in this case takes the following form : _ the size of an @xmath193 code @xmath194 is bounded above by _",

    "\\sum_{i=1}^r ie_i\\le d\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the argument for the univariate case given in this section can be repeated once we establish a three - term relation for the polynomials @xmath197 let @xmath198 be the column vector of the normalized polynomials @xmath199 ordered lexicographically with respect to all @xmath28 that satisfy @xmath200 and let @xmath201 be a suitably chosen linear polynomial .",
    "then @xmath202 where @xmath203 are matrices of order @xmath204 and @xmath205 respectively .",
    "the elements of these matrices can be computed explicitly from combinatorial considerations .",
    "this gives an explicit form of the operator @xmath206 in the orthonormal basis .",
    "relying on this , it is possible to derive a bound on codes in the nrt space of the form ( [ eq : bound ] ) and perform explicit calculations , both in the case of finite parameters and for asymptotics .",
