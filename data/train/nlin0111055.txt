    "when one tries to computationally locate constant shape traveling wave solutions in an equation that supports them , the standard procedure is to go to a traveling frame , so as to change the time - dependent problem into a steady state one .",
    "since , however , the correct speed is not , in general , known _ a priori _ , two possibilities exist : either we will see no steady states ( having guessed the wrong speed ) , or we will see infinitely many ( if we were fortunate in guessing the correct speed ) . the simple solution to writing fixed point algorithms for this problem is to realize that one is allowed to pick _",
    "one _ out of the the one - parameter infinity of steady state solutions of the pde in the traveling frame .",
    "one - parameter here corresponds to traveling ( translational invariance , a continuous symmetry group ) in one spatial dimension ; the concept generalizes directly to traveling in more than one spatial dimensions .",
    "computationally one augments the system by writing an additional ( possibly nonlocal ) condition , called a  pinning condition \" @xcite .",
    "we then have enough equations to solve for the _ one _ solution _ and _ the correct traveling speed simultaneously .",
    "rowley and marsden @xcite introduced recently a _ template - based _",
    "technique for  factoring out \" translational invariance ; their work was motivated by the so - called karhunen - loeve expansion in the case of pdes with traveling wave solutions .",
    "this was done by choosing a ( more or less arbitrary ) function , the _ template _ , and using it to systematically pick out one out of the one - parameter infinity of elements of the group orbit in a manner that will be explained below .",
    "we have recently implemented a discrete time version of this template - based approach to perform what we call  effective \" bifurcation analysis of evolution equations in complicated media @xcite .",
    "an important contribution of the work of rowley and marsden is that through the template method they allow the pinning to be done in a _ dynamic _ way .",
    "this means that we do not just implement some computational contraction mapping , and then converge on its fixed point , which is the solution traveling with constant speed and constant shape . through the template we actually have a way to ",
    "factor out \" the translational invariance in _ continuous time _ , and thus get an equation _ in an appropriate frame _ at all times .",
    "this is quite interesting since , often , what we want to find is not just the final solution , but we also want a view unobstructed \" by the symmetry group of the physical dynamics of the approach to the traveling wave .",
    "it is of course , in principle , possible to _ first _ find the traveling solution by some independent means ( e.g. analytically ) and then _ factor it out _ from the dynamics .",
    "the template approach allows us to do the  factoring out \" of the group orbit naturally and continuously in time , without _ a priori _ knowledge of either the traveling solution or its speed .",
    "moreover , as a simple byproduct it yields at the end the solution _ and _ the correct speed .    in this paper",
    "we extend the template approach to another continuous symmetry group : self - similarity . we take advantage of the fact that using a template to factor out self - similarity",
    ", we actually obtain a _ dynamic evolution equation_. this equation not only gives the self - similar solutions , but it actually gives a view of the _ dynamics _ of approach to the self - similar solution with the self - similarity conveniently factored out .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : in the following section we show how to derive the transformed evolution equation for the scaled variable .",
    "we then illustrate the procedure through the computation of two well - known solutions ( the barenblatt solution , a self - similar solution of the first kind , and the graveleau solution , a self - similar solution of the second kind ) through the dynamics of the transformed equation .",
    "we conclude by a discussion of what we perceive as the implications of the approach , including alternative ( to integration ) computational approaches to the location of self - similar solutions .",
    "we also discuss briefly the discrete - time implementation of the approach on the original ( as opposed to the transformed ) equation .",
    "this has possibly important implications because of the recently proposed ",
    "coarse \" integration / bifurcation analysis techniques for analyzing microscopic ( e.g. molecular dynamics ( md ) or monte carlo ( mc ) ) timesteppers .",
    "it is conceivable that the computer - assisted analysis of self - similarity proposed here can be carried out even in cases where coarse , macroscopic equations describing the evolution of moments of molecular distributions conceptually exist but _ are not available in closed form_.    we also note that what we propose here shares many elements with the approaches described , for example , in page 326 of the book of goldenfeld @xcite , and in chapter 6 of @xcite , including references to the work of the authors of the book , as well as papanicolaou , zakharov and their groups .",
    "we are currently exploring the similarities and differences of our work with that literature ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "because of the long ties , over the years , of two of the authors with the university of minnesota , and because this work came to fruition in an office at u of m. , we will call the transformed dynamics developed here the  mn - dynamics \" .",
    "self - similar solutions play an important role in the development of the theory of nonlinear evolutions equations .",
    "in addition to providing exact and sometimes even explicit solutions they often describe the asymptotic behavior at large times , or the asymptotic form of solutions in the neighborhood of some important change in behavior such as focusing or blow - up at some finite critical time .",
    "often a self - similar solution to an autonomous evolution equation in the variables @xmath0 is a function of the form @xmath1 where the similarity exponents @xmath2 and the function @xmath3 must be determined from the equation together with appropriate boundary and initial conditions . here",
    "@xmath4 is either the known initial time in which case we consider @xmath5 , or the unknown critical time so that we consider @xmath6 . in view of the time translation invariance",
    "we can always take @xmath7 . in some problems",
    "the exponents can be obtained _ a priori _ from scaling arguments and conservation laws .",
    "this is referred to as _ self - similarity of the first kind_. however , it is often the case that the exponents can not be gotten _ a priori _ and are usually obtained by solving what amounts to a nonlinear eigenvalue problem for the function @xmath3 .",
    "this is the case of _ self - similarity of the second kind_. a cogent account of the theory of self - similar solutions with many illuminating examples can be found in barenblatt s book @xcite .    in the next section",
    "we will derive the mn - dynamics equations for the construction of self - similar solutions . in section 4",
    "we illustrate the method by applying it to the computation of the barenblatt solution ( first kind self - similarity ) and the graveleau solution ( second kind self - similarity ) of the porous medium equation ( pme ) @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a constant . for properties of the porous medium equation",
    "see @xcite .",
    "consider the partial differential equation @xmath10 where the generally nonlinear operator @xmath11 acts on the variable @xmath12 . we restrict ourselves to operators for which there exist two constants @xmath13 and @xmath14 such that for all positive @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xmath17 for these operators the pde may have a one - parameter family of self - similar solutions @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the parameter , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 satisfies the ode @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "the exponents @xmath24 and @xmath25 satisfy the scaling condition @xmath26 we now present an alternative method of computing similarity solutions , which factors out the similarity exponent @xmath24 .",

    "we show the evolution of @xmath30 in fig .",
    "2 . as @xmath84 the solution tends to a steady state . in this case",
    "the corresponding physical time tends to a finite value @xmath85 which is the time at which the solution to the original initial value problem first becomes positive in the neighborhood of the origin .",
    "@xmath85 is called the focusing time . to determine the similarity exponent we use eqs .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) and ( [ 16 ] ) . for 2 space dimensions",
    "the correct value of @xmath86 and the mn - dynamics gives the approximate @xmath87 .",
    "the accuracy would be improved by using more gridpoints and enlarging the domain .",
    "locating the self - similar solutions and their exponents by integration of the mn - equation is , of course useful .",
    "it is , however , only one of the ways that we can now find these solutions .",
    "now that the self - similar solutions have become steady states of the mn - equation , we can bring all the tools of nonlinear dynamics to bear on their study .",
    "in particular , we can find self - similar solutions not only through the fact that they may be attracting ( by integration ) , but also through contraction mappings like newton s method ( this would be interesting in physical problems like the landau - gizburg equation @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , we can do bifurcation / continuation / stability calculations of the closed non - local pde and find all types of stable , unstable , bifurcating , possibly even more complicated ( e.g. periodic in the transformed frame , or even more complicated , chaotic in the transformed frame ) self - similar solutions .",
    "they are going to be elements of the global attractor of the mn - equation , or , in general , invariant objects for the mn - dynamics .",
    "for example , in the traveling case , a limit cycle in the transformed equation would correspond to a modulated traveling wave  so , possibly , a limit cycle of the transformed equation would correspond to a `` periodically self - similar '' solution for the self - similar problem .",
    "these might arise in hopf bifurcations of the mn - equation , and might be associated with complex exponents ; we are not sure at the moment what all these additional invariant objects might be , but it will be interesting to study them .",
    "we are certainly aware of cases that should correspond to steady state bifurcations in the mn - dynamics .    more importantly , however ,",
    "the jacobian of the linearization of the mn - equation at its steady states or limit cycles , should it prove to be a well defined object , will tell us what the stability in the self - similar frame is , with the self - similarity factored out .",
    "it will help us understand asymptotic rates of approach , bifurcations of new self - similar solutions , possibly find basins of attraction of different self - similar solutions as stable manifolds of saddle - self - similar solutions . in particular , it is conceivable that in the case of type - ii self - similar solutions , continuation and the use of this lenearization might facilitate the study of the post - focussing regime .",
    "there are many interesting singularities whose  other side \" we would like to explore .",
    "the porous medium equation is one of them ; possible examples from cosmology @xcite also come to mind .",
    "we conclude with a few ( speculative at the moment ) comments .",
    "first , when a successful transformation turns the problem of finding self - similar solutions into finding steady states , limit cycles , chaotic attractors , or in general , elements of the global attractor of the transformed dynamics , we can bring all the machinery of dynamical systems / bifurcation theory to bear on computing self - similar solutions and their transitions ( bifurcations in the tranformed frame ) .",
    "in particular , techniques much more powerful than simple integration ( e.g. contraction mappings like the newton method , continuation , and multiparameter bifurcation theory ) can be brought to bear on the transformed problem .",
    "second , in everything we have done so far , we first transform the equation , and then work with the transformed equation . in effect , one has to write a new code to analyze the old problem .",
    "the original reason we were attracted to the template approach to factoring out translational invariance was that we were interested in using it in what in general we term `` time - stepper '' based methods for numerical bifurcation theory .",
    "it is possible to implement the template procedure not only in continuous time , but also in discrete time : one runs the  original \" dynamics for some time and then  pulls back \" the result ( as opposed to constantly pulling it back as in @xcite ) .",
    "we have implemented this discrete time , time - stepper based bifurcation approach in @xcite for the traveling case ; in the same spirit , the discrete - time version of the approach can be used on the original equation in the self - similar case ( as opposed to writing down the transformed mn - equation ) .",
    "this opens the way for another interesting possibility . over the last few years",
    ", we have developed methods for what we call  coarse bifurcation analysis \" of microscopic time - steppers @xcite . in these",
    ", we create a map ( using microscopic dynamics , such as monte carlo , or lattice boltzmann ) from an initial condition in the space of a few moments of a distribution to a final condition ( after some time ) in the same truncated moments space of the distribution .",
    "the procedure involves  lifting \" the macroscopic initial condition to one or more microscopic ones conditioned on the few governing moments , running the microscopic code , and then averaging ( restricting ) back to governing moments space .",
    "there is a number of interesting issues about how long to run the microscopic simulator , and how to do good variance reduction , but we will not discuss this here .    based now on the coarse - time stepper implementation , suppose that we have microscopic simulations ( simulations at one level of description ) , and we suspect that some coarser description ( moments ) of the microscopic dynamics will have self - similar behavior .",
    "then , using the coarse time - stepper and the discrete - time version of the above procedure , it is possible , given a set of reasonable assumptions discussed in some detail in @xcite to find certain elements of the self - similar dynamics ( e.g. steady states , invariant sets , bifurcations ) of what the  coarse - mn - equation \" would have been , without having to explicitly construct ( approximate ) this coarse - mn equation .",
    "indeed , this approach gives rise to alternative , mathematics - motivated ensembles for performing the microscopic simulations ( with an eye towards the analysis of coarse dynamics ) @xcite .",
    "recent advances in multiscale computations ( projective and telescopic projective integrators @xcite , as well as what we provisionally call  patch dynamics \" ) may assist in doing these calculations efficiently , in smaller space and time scales than the full computational domain .",
    "these developments in multiscale computations are rather general , and not designed in particular with the coarse mn - dynamics in mind .",
    "we believe that the general approach outlined in this paper opens new computational possibilities in the study of self - similar problems and their dependence on parameters .",
    "problems ranging from interfacial fluid dynamics to shock waves , and from cell aggregation to cosmology and materials science may become more accessible to computer - assisted analysis , whether through closed macroscopic equations , or through the  coarse \" analysis of alternative , more microscopic descriptions .",
