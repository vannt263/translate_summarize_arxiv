    "the restriction that @xmath26 is a non - negative integer was removed by kanzieper and freilikher @xcite , but they still required the assumption that @xmath1 is even and that the recurrence coefficients have a limiting behavior .",

    "the condition ( [ condition - on - v - eq3 ] ) then says that the mean eigenvalue density @xmath33 should be strictly positive there .",

    "the steepest descent method for riemann - hilbert problems is used to establish universality of the sine kernel in the bulk of the spectrum for the associated unitary matrix ensembles . in our case the general scheme of the analysis is the same , and we refer to @xcite for some of the details and motivations .",

    "the second and most important difference lies in the fact that we have to do a local analysis near the origin .",
    "this is where the bessel functions @xmath58 come in .",
    "the construction of the local parametrix near the origin is analogous to the construction of the parametrix near the algebraic singularities of the generalized jacobi weight , recently done by one of us in @xcite .",
    "the local parametrix determines the asymptotics of the orthonormal polynomials near the origin , and thus also governs the universality at the origin of the spectrum .",
