    "radio pulsars are powered by rotational kinetic energy and experience losses due to the emission of electromagnetic energy while spinning down .",
    "the spin - down of radio pulsars is described by ( manchester & taylor , 1977 ) @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the spin frequency , @xmath5 is the frequency derivative and @xmath6 , the braking index , equals 3 for a spinning magnetic dipole in a vacuum . taking a derivative of ( 1 ) , we find that @xmath7 .",
    "taking further derivatives of ( 1 ) , and defining the second braking index as @xmath8@xcite , we find an expression @xmath9 .",
    "measuring a value of @xmath10 that agrees with the predicted value @xmath11 is an excellent check on the validity of the power law spin - down model of radio pulsars given in equation ( 1 ) .",
    "kaspi et al .",
    "( 1994 ) reported a value of @xmath12 and @xmath13 for psr  b1509@xmath058 .",
    "performing a phase - coherent timing analysis on twenty years of radio timing data for psr  b1509@xmath058  obtained from the molongolo observatory synthesis telescope and the parkes 64 m telescope , we found the second frequency derivative to be @xmath14  s@xmath15 , implying a braking index of @xmath16 .",
    "significant low - frequency timing noise in the data prohibited a phase - coherent analysis to determine an accurate value of the third frequency derivative .",
    "this prompted a partially phase - coherent timing analysis by breaking up the data into subsets of @xmath17 yr ( such that phase residuals were ` white ' in each interval following a fit of @xmath4 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) and plotting the values of @xmath20 against time , the results of which are shown in figure 1 .",
    "this method is less sensitive to timing noise which dominates on long time scales .",
    "we found a value @xmath1s@xmath2 by a weighted least - squares fit to the data .",
    "this value for @xmath21 is in agreement with that predicted from the spin - down law of @xmath22s@xmath2 .",
    "this measured value for @xmath21 implies a second braking index of @xmath23 , also in agreement with the predicted value of @xmath24 , though less than the value @xmath25 expected for an ideal spinning dipole .",
    "our measurement of the @xmath21 implies that the spin - down law correctly predicts the behaviour of psr  b1509@xmath058 , reinforcing the use of the power law given in equation ( 1 ) to describe the rotation of pulsars ."
