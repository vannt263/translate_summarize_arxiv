    "each one of those terms can be written in terms of quantum operators as    @xmath6    where @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) is the electron creation ( annihilation ) operator at site @xmath9 and @xmath10 or @xmath11 .",
    "the elements @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the on - site energy and the nearest neighbor hopping term , respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath14 ev corresponds to the typical carbon - carbon hopping element and it is chosen to be our energy unit .",
    "the time dependence is introduced by adding a time dependent component to the on - site energies of atoms located in the scattering region to simulate the presence of an ac gate plate .",
    "thus , @xmath15 where the ac parameters are @xmath16 , the amplitude of the potential and @xmath17 , the frequency . the bias voltage is assumed to be equally distributed among the two contacts as required to quasi - ballistic transport and a gate voltage is applied to the central region ( @xmath18 ) which shifts the energy levels .",
    "the contact term is given by    @xmath19    and we simulate quasi - transparent coupling between the electrodes and the sample @xcite using @xmath20 .",
    "our non - interacting model requires screening by a metallic substrate or by the surrounding gate that lessens electron - electron interactions .",
    "when these interactions come into play effects beyond our present scope may emerge @xcite .",
    "additional ingredients beyond the stationary theory have to be considered for the treatment of quantum driven systems . a general framework valid for noninteracting systems",

    "this means that an electron with initial energy @xmath26 has a certain probability of being scattered to a final energy state of @xmath27 .    assuming an homogeneous driving as well as a weak energy dependence of the self - energy due to the electrodes , both spatial and time dependencies of the floquet states can be factorized and the transport properties can be calculated within simple tien - gordon theory@xcite .",

    "the problem can be sensibly reduced thanks to a change of basis transformation which is introduced in detail in appendix a.    based on the tools introduced before we are able to investigate how the quantum transport properties of gnrs are affected by the ac field .",
    "these results are presented in the next session and help to sketch a panorama of of the response of both armchair and zigzag nanoribbons to such perturbation",
    ". our numerical analysis and interpretations are also supported by analytical expressions detailed on the appendix .",
    "as previously mentioned , fp patterns can be generated in electron waveguide systems with the aid of time independent gate and bias voltages .",
    "the quasi - transparent contacts between the leads and the conductor confines the electronic wave functions as in light resonant cavity in which coherent propagation modes can interfere destructively or constructively generating an interference pattern . in this sense , an oscillatory behavior of the electronic transmission is observed while tuning the external voltages and the shape of this pattern is strictly dependent on the electronic structure of the system .",
    "depending on the atomic details of their edges , graphene nanoribbons can reveal remarkable differences on their band structures and therefore generate distinct patterns as can be seen directly from fig .",

    "we present the fp pattern for an agnr system and underneath it is shown the picture for a zgnr .    ] and minimum conductances [ @xmath43 for agnr and @xmath44 for zgnr ] , respectively.,width=264 ]    firstly , we focus on fig [ fig25](a ) obtained for an agnr .",
    "the low energy linear dispersion of agnrs guarantees a regular energy spacing level scale , @xmath4 , when the system is brought to near - perfect ohmic regime . the gate potential shifts the regularly spaced energy levels while the bias voltage opens the energy window in which the electronic transmission might take place depending whether the electronic states interfere destructively or constructively .",
    "scanning the system through the simultaneously variation of those two control parameters , the fp panels are drawn with their characteristic diamonds filling the whole energy range .",
    "the size of the diamonds is given by @xmath4 and it is possible to show that @xmath45 , being @xmath46 and @xmath47 the length of the conductor .",
    "the well - defined diamond structures are therefore a manifestation of the discretization of the linear dispersion of agnrs and , for this reason , it is straightforward to infer that metallic carbon nanotubes also reveal similar patterns . in this sense , we conclude that such regular behavior is strictly associated with systems presenting a uniform electronic structure characterized by a well defined level spacing .",
    "richer panels as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig25](b ) are obtained just changing the geometry of the nanoribbons to zigzag - edge structures .",
    "it is clear from the schematic band structure shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) that discretization of the energy levels wo nt be regular since the energy dispersion is highly non linear nearby the flat band .",
    "it is only possible to define a characteristic energy spacing far from the charge neutrality point . from the picture ,",
    "three main patterns can be distinguished : ( i ) one background oscillation superposed to a ( ii ) thinner structure restrained in a cone - shaped and ( iii ) small emerging lines around @xmath48 associated with the flat state .",
    "the characteristic fp diamonds are only formed inside the cone corresponding to the region where @xmath49 . due to the non - linear dispersion ,",
    "the diamonds come in distinct sizes and evolves to the limit of large level spacing as the area of the cone increases .",
    "we have to mention that the thinner oscillations revealed mainly in the linear response regime ( iii ) can be easily suppressed by temperature since their energy scale is much smaller than @xmath50 . for ribbons of length @xmath3 the thin structure",
    "could be washed out already at temperatures of about @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , we expect to observe fp oscillations only at high bias as observed experimentally by f. miao _ et .",
    "finally , although we are coping with the same material , the microscopic details of the system strongly dictate the shape of the electronic transmission patterns .",
    "we now investigate how these coherent transport patterns are modified under the presence of ac gate potentials .      as advanced earlier",
    ", the fp conductance patterns can be fully controlled with the aid of ac potentials .",
    "two extra parameters will be used to tune the transport properties of the ribbons : ( i ) the amplitude of the ac potential ( @xmath16 ) and ( ii ) the frequency ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the linear conductance at zero bias calculated for the agnr structure as a function the intensity of the ac potential . on the right ( left )",
    "panel , the conductance of the ribbon is initially set in a minimum ( maximum ) value .",
    "different lines correspond to different frequency values .",
    "we can see that the electronic transmission oscillates and damps to an average value , @xmath52 , for two of the chosen frequencies .",
    "this value coincides approximately with the conductance in the static situation ( null ac ) . for @xmath53 ,",
    "no oscillations in the transport response is verified , remaining almost constant in the whole @xmath16 range .",
    "two completely distinct responses can be highlighted from this figure as the frequency is changed : an oscillatory and a constant one ( when the frequency matches with the energy level spacing ) .",
    "the system demonstrates to be strongly sensitive to frequency variations .",
    "to better understand some of these features , it is effective to appeal to the adiabatic limit in which @xmath54 is the smallest energy - scale of the system ( @xmath55 )",
    ". therefore , the period of the ac oscillation is long enough so that the system can be considered instantenously as static . within this approximation ,",
    "the conductance is given by @xmath56 and , from eq .",
    "[ currenttg ] , the transmission can be expanded in taylor series around @xmath57 . using the identity",
    "@xmath58 $ ] and having in mind that the transmission function follows a periodic dependence as @xmath59 , we obtain    @xmath60    it can be noticed that @xmath52 remains unaffected by the ac potential while the amplitude @xmath61 is modulated by a factor of @xmath62 . therefore , the oscillatory contribution is canceled whenever @xmath63 , i.e. , the argument @xmath64 is a root of @xmath65 . in the following ,",
    "we investigate how the whole interference patterns is affected choosing certain values of @xmath16 and @xmath17 which result in special transport conditions on those curves .",
    "for instance , we select the following ac parameters : ( a ) @xmath66 ( only dc components ) , first ( b ) minimum and ( c ) maximum conductance and ( d ) constant transmission on the curve @xmath53 .    , the dashed red line for @xmath67 and the dotted blue line for @xmath53 .",
    "panel ( a ) corresponds to @xmath68 and in ( b ) the gate voltage is tuned in such a way that @xmath69.,width=340 ]    the panels [ fig25 ] show how the full fp interference patterns of an agnr interferometer change under the influence of an ac driven field being its intensity and frequency values marked on fig .",

    "the diagram ( a ) corresponds to the dc pattern already addressed on the previous section .",
    "these characteristic oscillations are entirely suppressed when the ac field is driven to the minimum point ( b ) followed by a partial revival and a phase inversion when the perturbation is led to situation ( c ) .",
    "finally , an identical dc fp diagram is recovered when @xmath70 , and this reflects in a robustness feature of the system .",
    "therefore , depending on how the ac parameters are tuned , it is possible to invert the phase of the oscillations , to suppress or to recover them .",
    "this can be interpreted as a manifestation of _ wagon - wheel condition _ in the quantum domain as found for carbon nanotubes @xcite .",
    "we now demonstrate that agnr also displays such quantum effect .",

    "( bottom ) as a function of the driving amplitude and frequency .",
    "white and black colors correspond to maximum and minimum amplitudes , respectively.,width=321 ]    in contrast with the conductance , we find that the noise power ( fig . [ fig3]-lower panel )",
    "does not behave as in the static case whenever the whagon - wheel condition is met .",
    "in fact , the suppression of the noise takes place when the frequency is commensurate with an even multiple of the level spacing .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the noise under ac fields is highly sensitive to the phase of the transmission amplitude which changes by @xmath74 over each resonance . in between these minima",
    ", there are local maxima whose intensity is proportional to @xmath16 . summarizing , the noise recovers the static response whenever @xmath75 being @xmath73 an integer .",
    "this behaviour is the same as the one found for and in particular for metallic nanotubes@xcite where this effect was interpreted as a manifestation of the wagon - wheel condition in which the static noise behaviour requires a doubling of the stroboscopic frequency .",
    "this occurrence may result in important technological applications since it is possible to combine high transmission states with low current noise .    under dc conditions ,",
    "zgnr already presented richer interference patterns mainly due to its non - linear dispersion around the flat state . combining this highly dense spectrum nearby the fermi energy with the application of an external ac driven field",

    "reduces the level spacing and then the noise is suppressed whenever the wagon - wheel condition is met .",
    "we find that the lower limit for the frequencies required to achieve this effect is in the order of @xmath79 . as for the scaling with the width",
    ", we observed a ten percent increase in the current noise for widths of about @xmath80 nm for thz frequencies .",
    "this small effect is observed as a result of the onset of a contribution due to higher subbands .",
    "this occurs when inelastic processes can produce excitations that allow to tunnel over the gap of the corresponding massive subband , thereby representing a contribution to the noise from electrons deep in the fermi sea .",
    "by combining a tight - binding model with a floquet solution we have solved for the electronic transport properties of ac - gated graphene nanoribbons in the fabry - perot regime .",
    "in contrast to carbon nanotubes , the interference pattern for nanoribbons depends strongly on the shape of the edges . for armchair edges ,",
    "the results coincide with those obtained for nanotubes and a detailed derivation of both current and noise properties was presented .",
    "the time - dependent field can be tuned such that the fabry - perot oscillations become smoother , invert their phase , recover the original dc features or even suppress them . moreover , whenever @xmath81 is an even multiple of the mean level spacing @xmath4 it is possible to achieve states of high conductance with low current noise ( quantum wagon - wheel effect ) .",
    "these calculations for armchair edges greatly benefitted from a mode decomposition which allows a drastic reduction of the computational time ( see appendix [ apa ] ) . on the other hand , for zigzag - edges",
