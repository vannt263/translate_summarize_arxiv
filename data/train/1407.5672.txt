    "large frame optical gyroscopes based on he - ne ring laser technology are presently the most sensitive devices for measuring inertial rotational motion@xcite .",
    "the use of these systems has been considered in the past for several fundamental physics applications including experimental tests of fundamental symmetries @xcite , axions detection @xcite , test of metric theories of gravitation @xcite , and gravitational waves detectors @xcite .",
    "recent improvements in the stability and resolution of this kind of devices fostered the ginger ( gyroscope in general relativity ) project @xcite .",
    "this experiment aims to develop a ground based array of large - frame laser gyroscopes ( of at least @xmath3 in side ) for the detection of the space - time geometry deformation induced by the earth s rotation , also known as frame - dragging or lense - thirring effect . +",
    "the frequency difference @xmath4 between the two opposite traveling beams in a laser gyroscope is given by the basic theory of the sagnac effect : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the ring cavity area vector enclosed by the ring laser optical path , @xmath7 the cavity perimeter length , @xmath8 the laser wavelength and @xmath9 the frame angular velocity .",
    "errors and instabilities in the geometrical scale factor @xmath10 affect directly the measured rotation rate .",
    "the present limit of the most stable devices is given by the slow deformations of the optical cavity induced by temperature , pressure and aging of materials .",
    "several approaches have been followed in the last years in order to enhance the stability of the ring cavity geometry .",
    "the best results have been obtained up to now by using monolithic structures operating in very well isolated , i.e. passively stabilized , laboratories . today",
    "s best performing ring laser is the 4 m side g installed in a controlled area at the geodetic observatory of wettzell , germany @xcite .",
    "it is a monolithic block of zerodur with four mirrors mounted in optical contact with the cavity frame .",
    "it operated without any active control on the geometry until 2010 .",
    "since then , an active control of the cavity shape has been engaged .",
    "such a control system stabilizes the ring laser optical frequency against an optical frequency reference by tuning the pressure inside a vacuum tank enclosing the whole monolithic cavity @xcite . in this way",
    "the cavity deformations induced by the variation of the pressure load on the four optically contacted mirrors are canceled to first order , with a consequent sensitive improvement of the long - term instrument stability .    for a ring laser in a ground - based laboratory ,",
    "the lense - thirring term is of order of 1 part in @xmath11 of the purely kinematic sagnac term of equation  [ fsagnac ] .",
    "the direct measurement of this effect implies the stabilization of the scale factor with an accuracy of at least 1 part in @xmath12 .",
    "the stability of g is about one order of magnitude far from this target .",
    "a direct way to overcome the present limits is to increase the sensitivity of the ring by enlarging the cavity dimensions .",
    "however , it is not feasible to have a larger monolithic block of zerodur ; an alternative solution is to develop an active control acting on the corner mirrors positions .",
    "experimental studies in this direction have been made on the g - pisa ring laser @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that locking the laser emission frequency to a suitable optical frequency standard provides a well defined configuration of the laser parameters but it is not the ultimate solution to the problem of the cavity deformation .",
    "in fact , variations of the area vector remain uncontrolled and the residual relative variation of the cavity side - lengths , even at constant perimeter , introduce instabilities on the rotational signal by changing the backscattering phase .",
    "this last error source dominates the dynamics of small ring lasers ( side lengths of about @xmath13 ) and it is strongly reduced by increasing the gyroscope linear dimensions . for side length larger than @xmath14 , the geometrical stability sets the main limit to the system performances and can be controlled only by means of interferometric methods .",
    "the ideal instrument would be a cavity stabilized to the shape of a perfect square , where the four sides are perpendicular and of the same absolute length . with a root mean square amplitude @xmath15 , both g and g - pisa are square ring laser gyroscopes .",
    "one advantage of this cavity shape on the triangular one is that the two diagonals can constitute additional degrees of freedom to constrain . as a fact , typical he - ne ring laser mirrors having a reflectivity of @xmath16 at @xmath17 angle of incidence , still have a good reflectivity at normal incidence .",
    "this allows us to use the same external laser source providing the perimeter reference frequency for stabilizing the length of the two fabry - prot cavities formed by the opposite mirrors of the ring . by performing a beam steering simulation of the ring cavity",
    "it can be shown @xcite that , when the length of the two diagonals is locked to the same value , the perturbations to the mirror positions affect only quadratically the ring laser scale factor . in figure  [ stability ] it is shown the simulated relative variation of the scale factor@xmath18 induced by a random displacement noise applied to the four mirrors centers of curvature .",
    "the position of each mirror has been changed along the three directions of space by three independent random processes with root - mean - square amplitude @xmath15 ; the case of a cavity with equal absolute diagonal lengths is compared to the uncontrolled case and to the case where the two lengths are both stabilized better than 1 part on @xmath19 but differ one from the other by a quantity @xmath20 .",
    "details are in the caption .",
    "acting on the four mirrors positions .",
    "two cases with different side length @xmath21 and mirrors curvature radius @xmath22 are simulated : gp2 cavity , @xmath23 , @xmath24 ( continuous blue line ) ; ginger cavity , @xmath25 , @xmath26 ( gray dashed line ) . for each cavity ,",

    ", width=321 ]    it is worth noting that even in the case of unbalances of the order of @xmath29 the length stabilization constraint provides a high rejection of the mirrors position perturbations from the scale factor , with residual fluctuations at level of 1 part in @xmath12 .",
    "motivated by this numerical results we designed a new ring laser gyroscope , called gp2 @xcite , dedicated to the optimization and stabilization of the geometrical form factor and , in particular , to the experimental implementation of the length stabilization of the diagonal cavities .",
    "it is a square resonator @xmath30 in side , equipped with a system of 6 piezoelectric actuators controlling the four mirrors positions .",
    "a special vacuum chamber encloses the four mirrors , the optical path along the ring cavity as well as the two diagonals .",
    "+ in this paper we present an experimental technique to set equal the lengths of two linear fabry - prot resonators formed by curved mirrors used typically as corner reflectors in he - ne ring laser gyros , in order to simulate the ring cavity diagonals on an optical bench . the measurement of the cavity absolute length can be obtained with very high precision ( @xmath31 ) if the cavity resonance is locked to the frequency of an optical frequency standard and the integer number @xmath32 of half - wavelengths contained between the two mirrors is unambiguously estimated .",
    "this last can be obtained by measuring the cavity fsr with a precision better than @xmath33 . in the recent literature , particularly in the field of gravitational wave detectors , several techniques have been proposed to measure the fsr of long linear cavities . in particular ,",

    "see also @xcite .",
    "the strategy we adopted is based on the use of a single frequency - stabilized diode laser at @xmath37 , phase modulated with a single eom driven by a combination of three independent modulation frequencies .",
    "the first modulation provides the pound - drever - hall signals for locking the two cavities to the same laser optical frequency .",

    "<S> we present the experimental test of a method for controlling the absolute length of the diagonals of square ring laser gyroscopes . </S>",
    "<S> the purpose is to actively stabilize the ring cavity geometry and to enhance the rotation sensor stability in order to reach the requirements for the detection of the relativistic lense - thirring effect with a ground - based array of optical gyroscopes . </S>",
    "<S> the test apparatus consists of two optical cavities 1.32 m in length , reproducing the features of the ring cavity diagonal resonators of large frame he - ne ring laser gyroscopes . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed measurement technique is based on the use of a single diode laser , injection locked to a frequency stabilized he - ne / iodine frequency standard , and a single electro - optic modulator . </S>",
    "<S> the laser is modulated with a combination of three frequencies allowing to lock the two cavities to the same resonance frequency and , at the same time , to determine the cavity free spectral range ( fsr ) . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a stable lock of the two cavities to the same optical frequency reference , providing a length stabilization at the level of 1 part in @xmath0 , and the determination of the two fsrs with a relative precision of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this is equivalent to an error of @xmath2 on the absolute length difference between the two cavities . </S>"
