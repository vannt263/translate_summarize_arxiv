    "new spectroscopic data on the a@xmath1@xmath11 level in @xmath2c@xmath3o was obtained by three different experimental techniques : a@xmath4x@xmath5(0,0 ) 2 + 1 uv photon laser rempi , a@xmath4x@xmath5@xmath6 synchrotron absorption and vuv fourier - transform spectroscopy , and b@xmath9a@xmath1@xmath6 photoemission in a discharge with visible fourier - transform spectroscopy .",
    "the uncertainty of measured transition frequencies was 0.002@xmath8 for the laser data , 0.010.03@xmath8 for the vuv - fts experiment , and 0.0030.03 for the vis - fts experiment . from this combined data , the level energies of a@xmath1(0 )",
    "were determined up to @xmath10 , as well as for the perturbing levels e@xmath13@xmath19 and d@xmath14@xmath19 , with accuracies between 0.002 to 0.03@xmath8 .    combining the new information with literature data on @xmath2c@xmath3o and other co isotopologues allowed for a deperturbation of this complex of interacting levels and the fitting of model energy levels to all experimental data within their uncertainties .",
    "this required fitting 17 independent adjustable parameters .",
    "these newly - deduced parameters comprise the molecular constants governing the a@xmath1(0 ) , e@xmath13(1 ) , and d@xmath14(4 ) levels , as well as the spin - orbit and l - uncoupling parameters connecting e@xmath13(1 ) , d@xmath14(4 ) , d@xmath12(0 ) and @xmath165 with a@xmath1(0 )",
    ".    this data is part of an ongoing study of a@xmath1 levels and their perturbations in multiple co isotopologues .",
    "it is our goal to establish isotope - independent ( electronic ) perturbation parameters to describe the a@xmath1 of co for all isotopologues , based on values derived in the present study for @xmath2c@xmath3o and previous works on @xmath16c@xmath3o  @xcite and @xmath16c@xmath64o @xcite .",
