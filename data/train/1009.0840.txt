    "many interesting thermodynamic measurements have been performed on bpcb .",
    "we select in the following some of these experiments and compare them to the theoretical predictions .",
    "the longitudinal magnetization that can be measured very precisely by nmr ( see ref .  ) was shown to agree remarkably with the one computed using the weakly coupled ladder model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mz_zerot ] ) . unfortunately , the magnetization is not very sensitive to the underlying model ( sec .",
    "[ sec : criticalfields ] ) .",
    "thus it can not be used to select between various models , but once the model is fixed , it can be used to fix precisely the parameters given the high accuracy of the experimental data . in particular , the position of the critical fields are very sensitive to the values of the intraladder couplings ( sec .  [",
    "sec : criticalfields ] ) .",
    "the couplings determined by this method are @xmath394 and @xmath395 .",
    "a more selective test to distinguish between various models is provided by the specific heat .",
    "this is due to the fact that the specific heat contains information on high energy excitations which are characteristic for the underlying model . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cvst ] the experimental data are remarkably described , up to an accuracy of a few percent , by a simple heisenberg ladder hamiltonian with the parameters extracted from the magnetization . in particular , not only the low temperature behavior is covered by the ladder description , but also the higher maxima .",
    "this indicates that the ladder hamiltonian is an adequate description of the compound .",
    "the small discrepancies between the specific heat data and the calculation which is essentially exact can have various sources . first of all , the substraction of the non - magnetic term in the experimental data can account for some of the deviations .",
    "furthermore the interladder coupling can induce slight changes in the behavior of the specific heat .",
    "finally deviations from the simple ladder hamiltonian can be present .",
    "small anisotropy of the couplings can exist and indeed are necessary to interpret recent esr experiments @xcite .",
    "other terms such as longer range exchanges or dzyaloshinskii - moryia ( dm ) terms might occur along the legs even if the latter is forbidden by symmetry along the dominant rung coupling .",
    "clearly all these deviations from the heisenberg model can not be larger than a few percents .",
    "they will not lead to any sizeable deviation for the luttinger parameters ( fig .",
    "[ fig : llparameter ] ) in the one dimensional regime .",
    "close to the critical points they can , however , play a more important role .",
    "it would thus be interesting in subsequent studies to refine the model to take such deviations into account .",
    "after having fixed the model and the intraladder couplings up to a few percents we use it to compute other experimentally accessible quantities such as the magnetostriction , thermal expansion , the nmr relaxation rate , the transition temperature to the ordered phase and its order parameter . in refs .",
    "the magnetostriction and thermal expansion were compared to the theoretical results using the described ladder model .",
    "a very good agreement was found in a broad range of temperature ( not shown here ) .",
    "note that only a full ladder model allows a global quantitative description of the magnetostriction effect which provides an additional confirmation of the applicability of the model .",
    "the quality of the determination of the model and its intraladder parameters becomes even more evident in the comparison of the nmr data for the relaxation rate @xmath181 with the theoretical results of the luttinger liquid theory as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : t1 ] .",
    "one _ adjustable parameter is left , namely the hyperfine coupling constant ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : relaxationtime ] ) .",
    "this parameter allows for a global expansion of the theoretical curve , but not for a change of its shape .",
    "the agreement between the theory and the experimental data is very good over the whole range of the magnetic field and only small deviations can be seen .",
    "the compound bpcb thus allows to _ quantitatively _ test the luttinger liquid universality class .",
    "even though the luttinger liquid description is restricted to low energies , in bpcb its range of validity is rather large .",
    "indeed at high energy , its breakdown is approximately signaled by the first peak of the specific heat@xcite ( see sec .  [",

    "this has a maximum scale of about @xmath396 at midpoint between @xmath109 and @xmath67 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : tmagnetization].c ) . given the low ordering temperature which has a maximum at about @xmath397 this leaves a rather large luttinger regime for this compound .",
    "taking now the coupling between ladders into account , one can induce a transition to a three - dimensional ordered phase .",
    "the transition temperature is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : criticaltemperature ] .",
    "experimentally it is determined by nmr@xcite and neutron diffraction measurements @xcite .",
    "theoretically the ladders are described by luttinger liquid theory and their interladder coupling is treated in a mean - field approximation ( secs .",
    "[ sec : luttinger_liquid ] and  [ sec : mean - field ] ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : criticaltemperature ] , the luttinger liquid theory provides a remarkable description of the transition to the transverse antiferromagnetic order at low temperatures .",
    "the shape of @xmath398 is almost perfectly reproduced , in agreement with both the nmr@xcite and the nd data@xcite .",
    "the comparison with the experiments determines the interladder coupling @xmath89 , the only adjustable parameter .",
    "the simple mean - field approximation would give a value of @xmath399 .",
    "as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : transitiontemperature ] mean - field tends to underestimate the coupling and it should be corrected by an essentially field independent factor .",
    "taking this into account we obtain a coupling of the order of @xmath400 .",
    "the order parameter in the antiferromagnetic phase can also be observed by experiments .",
    "it shows a very interesting shape . at a pure experimental level neutron diffraction and nmr",
    "have some discrepancies as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : orderparameter ] .",
    "these discrepancies can be attributed to the different temperatures at which the data has been taken , and a probable underestimate of the temperature in the neutron diffraction experiments@xcite .",
    "indeed the order parameter close to the critical magnetic field @xmath67 is very sensitive to temperature , since the transition temperature drops steeply in this regime .",
    "note that although the nmr allows clearly for a more precise measurement of the transverse staggered magnetization it can not give its absolute value .",
    "thus the amplitude of the order parameter is fixed from the neutron diffraction measurement . even though a good agreement between the theoretical results and the experimental results is obtained ,",
    "several questions concerning the deviations remain to be addressed .",
    "first , the theoretical curve does not fully follow the shape of the experimental data . particularly at high fields",
    "the experimental data shows a stronger decrease .",
    "a simple explanation for this effect most likely comes from the fact that the calculation is performed at zero temperature , while the measurement is done at @xmath401 .",
    "this is not a negligible temperature with respect to @xmath86 , in particular at magnetic fields close to @xmath67 .",
    "extrapolation of the experimental data to zero temperature@xcite improves the agreement .",
    "however , for a detailed comparison either lower temperature measurements or a calculation of the transverse staggered magnetization at finite temperature would be required .",
    "both are quite difficult to perform and will clearly require further studies .",
    "the second question comes from the amplitude of the staggered magnetization .",
    "indeed the experimental data seem to be slightly above the theoretical curve , even if one uses the value @xmath402 for the interladder coupling .",
    "this is surprising since one would expect that going beyond the mean - field approximation could only reduce the order parameter .",
    "naively , one would thus need a larger coupling , perhaps of the order of @xmath403 to explain the amplitude of the order parameter .",
    "this is a much larger value than the one extracted from the comparison of @xmath86 .",
    "how to reconcile these two values remains open .",
    "the various anisotropies and additional small perturbations in the ladder hamiltonian could resolve part of this discrepancy .",
    "however , it seems unlikely that they result in a correction of @xmath89 by a factor of about 2 - 3 .",
    "another origin might be the presence of some level of frustration present in the interladder coupling .",
    "clearly more experimental and theoretical studies are needed on that point .",
    "the inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) technique is a direct probe for dynamical spin - spin correlation functions .",

    "<S> we investigate weakly coupled spin-@xmath0 ladders in a magnetic field . the work is motivated by recent experiments on the compound @xmath1 ( bpcb ) . </S>",
    "<S> we use a combination of numerical and analytical methods , in particular the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) technique , to explore the phase diagram and the excitation spectra of such a system . </S>",
    "<S> we give detailed results on the temperature dependence of the magnetization and the specific heat , and the magnetic field dependence of the nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) relaxation rate of single ladders . </S>",
    "<S> for coupled ladders , treating the weak interladder coupling within a mean - field or quantum monte carlo approach , we compute the transition temperature of triplet condensation and its corresponding antiferromagnetic order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> existing experimental measurements are discussed and compared to our theoretical results . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore we compute , using time dependent dmrg , the dynamical correlations of a single spin ladder . </S>",
    "<S> our results allow to directly describe the inelastic neutron scattering cross section up to high energies . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the evolution of the spectra with the magnetic field and compare their behavior for different couplings . </S>",
    "<S> the characteristic features of the spectra are interpreted using different analytical approaches such as the mapping onto a spin chain , a luttinger liquid ( ll ) or onto a t - j model . for values of parameters for which such measurements exist , we compare our results to inelastic neutron scattering experiments on the compound bpcb and find excellent agreement . </S>",
    "<S> we make additional predictions for the high energy part of the spectrum that are potentially testable in future experiments . </S>"
