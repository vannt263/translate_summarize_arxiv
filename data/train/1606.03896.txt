    "effects of the system - environment coupling , however weak they are , play a decisive role in out - shaping the system s asymptotic state . indeed , such effects may not necessarily present a nuisance but can be of beneficial use .",
    "particularly , they can be exploited to steer the system towards desired states , including pure and high - entangled ones @xcite .",
    "this recent idea of engineering by dissipation @xcite has promoted a dissipative time evolution to the same level of importance as that of a unitary evolution .",

    "the particular structure of the floquet propagator , and thus the properties of the floquet states , depend on modulation parameters .",
    "this allows to grasp effects @xcite which are out of reach of experimentally available time - independent hamiltonians in atom optics , optomechanics , and solid state physics .",
    "the combined effect of all three factors , ( i ) many - body interactions , ( ii ) coupling to an environment , and ( iii ) periodic external driving , provides the motivation for the investigation we undertake with this study .",
    "we start by introducing the notion of floquet maps which constitute an extension to the dissipative case of the floquet propagator @xcite , and demonstrate how those can be used to obtain non - equilibrium asymptotic states .",
    "we next study a many - body model , a driven bose - hubbard dimer , and use both , a full quantum mechanical treatment and a mean - field description , to gain insight into the properties of the time - periodic asymptotic states .",

    "note that all parameters of the system are scaled with respect to the planck constant @xmath14 .",
    "strictly speaking , modulations affect both the unitary and the dissipative part of the generator @xmath15 , and in general both the hamiltonian @xmath9 and the dissipative matrix @xmath16 , have to become time - dependent @xcite .",
    "the complete theoretical foundation of a time - dependent master equation of the type ( [ lind ] ) still remains an open problem @xcite .",
    "however , if the matrix @xmath17 is positive semidefinite at any instant of time , the propagator @xmath18 is completely positive and trace - preserving . in this case",
    "a master equation in the form of ( [ lind ] ) is meaningful @xcite .",
    "this is a set - up which is now frequently used to model quantum systems far from equilibrium ; see , e.g. , @xcite .    when the generator @xmath15 is time dependent , the propagator @xmath19 depends on both parameters , the starting time @xmath20 and the final time @xmath21 .",
    "the closure of the set of propagators for different times is lost and they no longer form a semi - group .",
    "it is stated by lendi  @xcite that `` the best chance to find a solution to a master equation [ with a time - dependent generator ] is only offered by a possible existence of transformations which eliminate the time dependence '' .",
    "consistently , most studies until now have focused on removing the time - dependence when dealing with time - periodic generators , either by ( i ) finding a proper gauge , which makes the original time - periodic hamiltonian time - independent @xcite and then assuming that the dissipator remains time - independent in the new frame ( this is often a good approximation in quantum optics , where frequencies of modulations are much higher than the decay rates ) , or ( ii ) by changing to the floquet basis of the hamiltonian @xmath9 and then performing an additional secular approximation @xcite , or ( iii ) by trying to construct a magnus expansion - like approximations @xcite .",
    "all these strategies result in deriving an effective time - independent generator @xmath22 of the lindblad form . once the time - dependence is removed , one has to calculate the kernel of @xmath22 to find the asymptotic state @xmath23 of the system , i.e. , @xmath24 .",
    "under fairly general conditions @xcite , the time - homogeneous propagator @xmath25 relaxes towards a unique attractor @xmath23 of the dissipative quantum evolution .",
    "however , the above discussed approximations can not always be justified .",
    "below we propose an approach which does not demand the reduction to a time - independent form and avoids corresponding approximation schemes .",
    "note also that it is not necessary to switch to the floquet basis of the system hamiltonian , a step often performed ; see refs .",
    "@xcite .    because the master equation ( [ lind ] ) is linear , in the case of a time - periodic generator @xmath15 we can resort to floquet theory @xcite .",
    "we concentrate on the propagator @xmath26 which we refer to as the _ floquet map_. the floquet map has at least one eigenvalue @xmath27 and all other eigenvalues lie inside the unit circle . assuming that the floquet map is irreducible @xcite , the attractor @xmath28 of the map is its fixed point , i.e. , the eigen - operator corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath27 , @xmath29 .",
    "the uniqueness of the attractor solution is related to the symmetries of the generator @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "after a sufficiently large time any initial density operator @xmath30 will converge to the time - periodic asymptotic state @xmath31 , i.e. , @xmath32 for an integer @xmath33 .",
    "the operator @xmath34 is the asymptotic density operator of the system at the stroboscopic instants of time .",
    "because @xmath31 is periodic in time , @xmath35 , the asymptotic density matrix for any instance of time @xmath21 , can be calculated via propagating @xmath36 up to time @xmath20 .",
    "evidently , the proposed approach , being general and mathematically formal , does not differentiate between single - particle and of many - particle systems . to exemplify the ample physics expected to emerge from the interplay of many - body interaction , dissipation and periodic driving , we consider a system composed of @xmath37 interacting bosonic atoms hopping over a dimer which is subjected to periodic driving .",
    "the considered system hamiltonian reads @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes the tunneling amplitude , @xmath40 is the interaction strength , and @xmath41 presents the modulation of the local potential . in particular we choose @xmath42 , where @xmath43 presents a static and @xmath44 models a dynamic energy offset between the two sites . here ,",
    "@xmath45 and @xmath46 are the annihilation and creation operators of an atom at site @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",
    "this hamiltonian has been previously studied theoretically @xcite and additionally has been implemented in several recent experimental studies @xcite . however , to the best of our knowledge , the joint action of all three ingredients  interaction , dissipation and temporal driving  has not been addressed before .    for the dissipator",
    "@xmath49 we use the single jump operator @xcite , @xmath50 which tends to `` synchronize '' the dynamics on the dimer sites , by constantly recycling anti - symmetric out - phase modes into the symmetric in - phase ones .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath51 is taken to be time - independent .",
    "this particular set - up serves as an illustration only . note that the floquet map approach applies equally well to other cases , e.g. , when both parts of the generator , unitary and dissipative ones , are time - periodic or when there are several jump operators acting on the system . because the jump operator ( 4 ) is non - hermitian , the propagators @xmath19 are not unital and the attractor solution is not the maximally mixed state , i.e. @xmath52 .     as a function of the interaction strength of the mean - field system ( [ eq : mean_sx])([eq : mean_sz ] ) .",

    "this is not guaranteed _ a priori _ , and , for a dissipative system , the commutator behaves differently compared to the unitary setup . a necessary comparison with the results of the exact quantum analysis then does justify the validity of the approximation .",

    "it is important to use a method for solving the linear system of differential equations ( [ eq : liouvilliankronecker ] ) which does exploit the sparseness of @xmath118 .",
    "one option is to use the standard runge - kutta scheme .",

    "we demonstrated that the concept of dissipative floquet maps provides an operational way to identify ` quantum attractors ' , i.e. , asymptotic time - periodic states of modulated open quantum systems .",
    "to illustrate this idea , we have applied the concept to a dissipative and periodically driven many - body model .",
    "we study the model both exactly and , in the limit of a large particle number , within a mean - field picture .",
    "the latter predicts transitions from regular to chaotic attractor as the interaction strength is varied .",
    "the analysis shows a strong dependence on the interaction strength , especially in proximity of the dynamical transitions predicted by mean - field theory .",
    "we conclude by pointing out possible research directions which may benefit from the use of floquet maps .",
    "it has been proposed to use time - periodic driving to create , for the situation with coherent hamiltonian systems , effective topologically protected states @xcite .",
    "the important problems of the stability of these states against dissipation or their creation with a synthetic dissiaption @xcite could be investigated by making use of our concept .",
    "another interesting question is whether the idea of ` engineering by dissipation ' @xcite can be extended somehow to periodically modulated systems .",

    "<S> we investigate the asymptotic state of a periodically driven many - body quantum system which is weakly coupled to an environment . the combined action of the modulations and the environment steers the system towards a state being characterized by a time - periodic density operator . to resolve this asymptotic non - equilibrium state at stroboscopic instants of time , </S>",
    "<S> we introduce the dissipative floquet map , evaluate the stroboscopic density operator as its eigen - element and elucidate how particle interactions affect properties of the density operator . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate the idea with a periodically modulated bose - hubbard dimer and discuss the relations between the interaction - induced bifurcations in a mean - field dynamics and changes in the characteristics of the genuine quantum many - body state . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that floquet maps provide insight into the system relaxation towards its asymptotic state and may help to understand whether it is possible ( or not ) to construct a stroboscopic time - independent generator mimicking the action of the original time - dependent one .    </S>",
