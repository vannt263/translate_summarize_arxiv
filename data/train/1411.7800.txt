    "indeed , this operators have shown to be particular appropriate for the study of a huge spectrum of phenomena , arising in several areas of physics , finance , biology , ecology , geophysics , and many others , such as anomalous transport and diffusion ( @xcite ) , hereditary phenomena with long memory , wave propagation in heterogeneous high contrast media ( @xcite ) , dislocation dynamics in crystals ( @xcite ) , non - local electrostatics . in this frame , the study of controllability properties for non - local evolution problem becomes a very interesting issue , both from a purely theoretical and from an applied point of view .",

    "the range of the exponent of the fractional laplace operator is fundamental for the positivity of the controllability result ; indeed , although the fractional laplacian is well defined for any @xmath4 in the interval @xmath37 , we can show that the sharp power when dealing with the control problem for our fractional schrdinger equation is @xmath34 , meaning that below this critical value the equation becomes not controllable .",
    "this fact is proved in one space dimension by developing a fourier analysis for our equation based on the results contained in @xcite and @xcite , where the authors compute an explicit approximation of the eigenvalues of the fractional laplacian in dimension one on the half - line @xmath38 and on the interval @xmath39 .",
    "+ for proving the controllability theorem stated above , we are going to apply the very classical technique combining the multiplier method ( @xcite ) and the hilbert uniqueness method ( hum , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , as it is shown in many very classical works on control theory ( see , for instance , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , we are reduced to prove what is called an `` observability inequality '' associated to our problem and then argue by duality . in our case",
    "we are going to prove : @xmath40 this inequality will be , in turn , a consequence of a pohozaev - type identity for the solution of the equation considered , derived by applying the multiplier method and a new pohozaev identity for the fractional laplacian ( @xcite ) , which has been recently proved by x. ros - oton and j. serra and which extends to the fractional case the by now well known identity proved by s.i .",
    "pohozaev in @xcite .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "we are allowed to follow this path because , being a positive and self - adjoint operator , the fractional laplacian possess a basis of eigenfunctions which forms a dense subspace of @xmath41 and , as we are going to show in the appendix to this work , these eigenfunctions are bounded on @xmath9 , and this is enough to recover the regularity we need . +   + the paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce the fractional laplace operator ; we present some very classical result ( @xcite ) and the recent ones of ros - oton and serra ( @xcite , @xcite ) concerning the regularity of the fractional dirichlet problem and the pohozaev - type identity . in section 3",
    "we analyse the fractional schrdinger equation ( [ fr schr pb ] ) .",
    "we first check its well posedness applying hille - yosida theorem .",
    "then , we derive the pohozaev identity and we apply it for proving the observability inequality .",
    "lastly , we prove our main result , theorem [ schr control thm ] . in section 4 we present a spectral analysis for our equation which will allow us to identify the sharp exponent needed for the fractional laplace operator in order to get a positive control result . in section 5",
    "we briefly present an abstract argument , due to tucsnak and weiss ( @xcite ) , which will allow us to employ the observability results for our fractional schrdinger equation in order to obtain the observability for a fractional wave equation involving the higher order operator @xmath42 .",
    "finally , section 6 is devoted to some open problem and perspective related to our work .",
    "we introduce here some preliminary results about the fractional laplacian that we are going to use throughout this paper . + we start by introducing the fractional order sobolev space @xmath43 .",
    "since we are dealing with smooth domains , say of class @xmath2 , we introduce this space by assuming that our open set @xmath3 is smooth . for @xmath1 , we denote by @xmath44 the fractional order sobolev space endowed with the norm @xmath45 we denote with @xmath46 the closure of @xmath47 ( the space of the test functions ) in @xmath43 .",

    "the following result , ( see e.g. ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * prop .",

    "[ fl fourier ] let @xmath53 and let @xmath0 be the fractional laplace operator defined in ( [ fr laplacian ] ) .",

    "let @xmath15,@xmath56 be two @xmath57 functions such that @xmath58 in @xmath16 ; then , it holds the following integration formula @xmath59    the proof follows simply by using fourier transform and plancherel theorem and the fact that the functions @xmath15 and @xmath56 vanish out of @xmath9 . indeed , we have @xmath60(\\xi)d\\xi \\\\ & = & \\displaystyle\\int_{{\\mathbb{r}}^n}\\hat{v}(\\xi)|\\xi|^{2s}\\hat{u}(\\xi)d\\xi = \\int_{{\\mathbb{r}}^n}|\\xi|^s\\hat{v}(\\xi)|\\xi|^s\\hat{u}(\\xi)d\\xi \\\\ & = & \\displaystyle\\int_{{\\mathbb{r}}^n}\\mathscr{f}{(-\\delta)^{\\frac{s}{2}}v}(\\xi)\\mathscr{f}{(-\\delta)^{\\frac{s}{2}}u}(\\xi)d\\xi=\\displaystyle\\int_{{\\mathbb{r}}^n}{(-\\delta)^{\\frac{s}{2}}v}(x){(-\\delta)^{\\frac{s}{2}}u}(x)dx.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "finally , it is now trivial to show that also the second equality in our statement holds ; this concludes our proof .",

    "moreover , as the authors already remark in @xcite , it is surprising that , starting from a non - local problem , they obtained a completely local term in their identity .",
    "this means that , although the function @xmath15 has to be defined in all @xmath10 in order to compute its fractional laplacian at a given point , knowing u only in a neighbourhood of the boundary we can already compute @xmath89 .",
    "we analyse here the fractional schrdinger equation ( [ fr schr pb ] ) . as already written before",
    ", our principal aim will be to show that the problem is exactly controllable from a neighbourhood of the boundary of the domain .",
    "however , the first issue we have to deal with is , of course , the one of the well posedness .",

    "thus , from hille - yosida theorem follows that ( [ schr abstract ] ) admits a unique solution @xmath99      in this section we present the tools we need in order to prove the controllability theorem [ schr control thm ] .",
    "firstly , we are going to employ the results of @xcite in order to obtain a pohozaev - type identity for the solution @xmath15 of ( [ fr schr pb ] ) ; from there , we derive two estimates for the @xmath43 norm of the initial datum , from above and from below , with respect to the boundary term appearing in the identity .",
    "these boundary inequalities will finally be used for the proof of the observability inequality ( [ schr obs ] ) .",
    "we introduce here the pohozaev - type identity for our fractional schrdinger equation , obtained by the classical method of multipliers ( @xcite ) and applying the identity proved by ros - oton and serra in @xcite .",
    "however , as it is written in the statement of proposition [ fl pohozaev prop ] , and as we already said before , this identity requires the functions involved to satisfy some very strict regularity assumptions , and we do not know if the solution @xmath15 of ( [ fr schr nh ] ) possess this regularity .",

    "+ since @xmath408 is supported in the set @xmath409 , we have @xmath410 .",
    "thus , it is well defined @xmath411 integrating the characteristic function @xmath412 on @xmath413 and applying fubini s theorem we obtain @xmath414 so that @xmath415 and @xmath416 for a.e .",
    "@xmath406 . now , from ( [ eigenpb f ] ) we obtain @xmath417 which yields to @xmath418 from this last inequality and from the fact that @xmath15 vanishes outside @xmath9 , if follows immediately @xmath419 and we deduce from ( [ f hs est ] ) that @xmath420 fix now @xmath421 such that @xmath422 . from the embedding theorems for the fractional sobolev spaces ( @xcite , @xcite ) we have @xmath423 .",
    "moreover , it follows from the hlder inequality that @xmath424 and @xmath425 thus , we deduce from ( [ v hs est ] ) that @xmath426{{\\left\\|v\\right\\|}_{l^{\\rho}(\\omega)}}.\\ ] ] since @xmath427 , we obtain @xmath428\\ ] ] which can be written as @xmath429 with @xmath430 .",
    "it follows that @xmath431 setting now @xmath432 , and remembering that @xmath416 , we deduce @xmath433 with @xmath434 . integrating the above differential inequality we get @xmath435 for all @xmath436 .",
    "now , if @xmath437 , then @xmath438 by definition .",
    "otherwise , we obtain @xmath439 for all @xmath440 , which implies in particular that @xmath441 note now that @xmath442 as @xmath443 and @xmath444 , so that @xmath445 is integrable near zero . since , instead , the function @xmath446 is not integrable at @xmath447 , this finally implies that @xmath448 .",

    "now , this is enough to allow us to apply the pohozaev identity for the fractional laplacian to the solution @xmath15 of our fractional schrdinger equation .",
    "indeed , theorem 1.4 of @xcite states that any bounded solution of @xmath450 with @xmath451 , i.e. lipschitz , satisfies the hypothesis ( i ) and ( ii ) of proposition [ schr pohozaev prop ] .",
    "but this is exactly our case , since , by definition any eigenfunction of the fractional laplacian satisfies the problem @xmath452 which is in the form of ( [ elliptic pb ] ) with @xmath398 clearly lipschitz , and since we just showed that all the eigenfunctions are bounded .",
    "moreover , we can conclude by observing that , always from the definition of eigenfunction , also hypothesis ( iii ) is clearly satisfied .",
