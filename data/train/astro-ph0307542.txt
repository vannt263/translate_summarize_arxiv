    "the source was very bright , however , the pile - up effect was negligible due to the significant broadening of the point spread function ( psf ) , enabling reliable spectral measurements (  3.2 ) .",
    "we observed the source again ( obs2 ) on 2003 april 21 for 47 ks ; we selected the continuous clocking ( cc ) mode to mitigate any pile - up and to exploit the mode s 2.85  ms time resolution .",
    "strong pulsations with a period @xmath36100 min are directly visible in the light curve ( figure 1 ; upper panel ) during obs1 ( kouveliotou _ et al .  _",
    "we measured the pulse period by first maximizing the signal - to - noise in the light curve by selecting photon energies in the range @xmath5 kev and by correcting the arrival times to the solar system barycenter .",
    "next , we constructed a template pulse profile from the full data set using a trial period determined from an epoch fold search .",
    "the data were split into 4 roughly equal time segments and folded on this trial period .",
    "we compared the relative phases of the four segments to the pulse template and finally we fitted them to a linear trend , which yielded the correction to our trial period . after a series of iterations , we find the best fit period for obs1 to be 5880(50 ) s. the pulse profile has a dominant sinusoidal component with significant substructure and varies as a function of energy ( figure 2 ; left panel ) .",
    "a portion of the substructure can be attributed to a quasi - periodic oscillation feature at @xmath37 hz .",
    "the pulse fraction is constant with energy across the _ chandra _  bandpass ; the @xmath5 kev rms value is 36.6(8)% ( 70(6)% peak - to - peak ) .    during obs2",
    "the source was detected at a lower intensity , a factor of @xmath38 fainter in flux ( @xmath5 kev ) .",
    "in addition , a visual inspection of the light curve shows substantially more flickering than present in obs1 ( figure 1 ; lower panel ) .",
    "the fourier power spectrum shows the 100 min pulsations at much weaker significance superposed upon an excess of red noise .",
    "there are no other coherent high frequency signals out to 175  hz . using the same technique as before",
    ", we measure a pulse period of @xmath39  s , consistent with the period derived from obs1 . the folded pulse profile during obs2 ( figure 2 ; right panel ) is significantly different than what it was four weeks earlier ; the pulse shape is more complex with more power in the higher harmonics . despite the changes in pulse shape",
    ", the pulse fraction has remained high and constant at @xmath40 rms ( @xmath5 kev ) .",

    "igr  @xmath0  is detected significantly off - axis ( @xmath42 ) during obs1 , necessitating a large extraction radius for the source spectrum to account for the significant psf distortion of the source and for the scattering of the hard photons of the source spectrum .",
    "we have , thus , collected source events from a circular region of @xmath43 radius . we extracted a background spectrum from a source free region of @xmath44 radius and on the same ccd .",
    "finally , we grouped the data into energy channels that contained at least 25 events each .",
    "we report here results on our phase - averaged fits to the data . during obs1",
    "the spectrum includes a highly significant fe line feature and is hard and highly absorbed .",
    "we have initially fitted the data with a pl + a gaussian line model ; the best fit parameters are given in table 2 , and the spectral fit is shown in figure 3 .",
    "the 2003 _ chandra _  flux is @xmath45 times higher than the _ asca _  flux of 1999 .",
    "we have also fitted the data with an absorbed thermal blackbody ( bb ) model with a line ( table 2 ) ; the fit statistic is slightly improved .",
    "finally , we have tested two - component ( continuum ) models of pl + bb and pl + pl ; we also find acceptable fits .",
    "however , the additional ( pl ) component in each case is very soft and steep , mostly contributing to a very narrow spectral range of the continuum below 3 kev , where the signal is very low .",
    "we conclude that the single model fits ( pl or bb ) better describe the data .    during obs2 ,",
    "the spectrum is also well described by an absorbed pl .",
    "we find that the absorption column has decreased significantly since obs1 , but is still in agreement with the best fit column density measured by _",
    "asca _ , suggesting that at least part of the column is due to local absorption .",
    "furthermore , we find that the fe line feature has faded beyond detection in obs2 .",
    "the upper limit we measure on the line equivalent width suggests that the flux in the line has faded more than the continuum flux ; the latter is now a factor of 15.5 lower than obs1 .",

    "our _ chandra _  observations of the fe line centroid in the igr  @xmath0  spectrum indicate that most likely the source is in a galactic x - ray binary system",
    ". if the 1.6 hr period is orbital , then there are two types of x - ray binary systems which can have similar periods and x - ray light - curve properties : a cyg x-3 like system ( 4.8  hr period ; milgrom 1976 ; parsignault _ et al .  _ 1977 ) and high - inclination accretion disk corona ( adc ) systems such as 4u  @xmath111 ( 5.57  hr period ; white _ et al .  _ 1981 ) .",
    "like both these sources igr  @xmath0  in outburst is showing a smoothly varying x - ray light - curve ; the depth of the modulation is not indicative of an eclipse and there is no phase dependent absorption .",
    "all three spectra are similar , well fit with a ( hard ) power law with a low energy cut off at @xmath112  kev and with large , broad iron lines at @xmath113  kev .",
    "the source luminosities are also within the same range of @xmath114  erg / s ( assuming a distance for igr  @xmath0  of 10  kpc ) .",
    "it is , however , questionable if a he star with a strong stellar wind such as in cyg x-3 could fit a system with an orbital period of 1.6  h. more likely , the system is an lmxb such as 4u  @xmath111 ; the questions that immediately arise are where did the extreme absorption detected in the spectrum of igr  @xmath0  originate if not from the stellar wind of a massive companion , and is a low mass companion sufficient to produce the fe line ?",
    "one expects systems with such periods to be transient ( king , kolb & burderi 1996 ) as the average mass transfer rate would probably be quite low .",
    "the ` outburst ' accretion rate could nevertheless be high , thus , if the adc interpretation is right , the true luminosity of the object is much higher than observed .",
    "it is just conceivable that this actually causes the intense absorption , if the accretion rate is highly super - eddington for the duration of the outburst .",
    "this would produce a dense outflowing wind , as is probably seen in some of the ultra luminous x - ray sources ( fabbiano _ et al .",
    "_ 2003 ) , which could give the absorption .",
    "similar super - eddington outflows , with extremely high columns , are seen in quasars inferred to be accreting at super - eddington rates ( pounds _ et al .  _ 2003 ; king & pounds 2003 ) .",
    "sources like this or with even higher columns could easily have been missed by earlier satellites , so there could be a whole class of them .    finally , we would like to note that if igr  @xmath0  is a lmxb , its orbital period would be in the range of those of the ms pulsar subclass , only five of which have been found .",
    "no ms pulsations were detected so far and unless the source becomes active again , current instrumentation does not afford ms pulsation searches .",
    "if on the other hand the 1.6 hr period is a neutron star spin period , the source is similar to 2s  @xmath115 , which has a spin period of @xmath116 hr ( finley , belloni & cassinelli 1992 ) and an fe line at 6.4 kev ( yamauchi _ et al .",
    "_ 1990 ) ; by analogy to other slow accreting pulsars we would expect the magnetic field of the neutron star in igr  @xmath0  to be of order @xmath117  gauss ."
