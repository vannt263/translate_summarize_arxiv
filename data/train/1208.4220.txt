    "scatterometry is a common technique for the characterization of nano - structured surfaces .",

    "the measured diffraction intensities are fitted to the calculated ones to derive the sought properties of the sample .",
    "it should be noted that the same numerical models are also used to predict , e.g. the imaging properties of mask structures in a photolithographic process",
    ". a better understanding of the accuracy of the optical models is therefore crucial also for many other applications than scatterometry .",
    "scatterometry , however , is the natural environment for the investigation of the accuracy of optical models because it is explicitly based on the correlation of geometrical structure and optical properties .",
    "currently , scatterometry is used as a relative metrology method for process control and process development .",
    "many attempts have been made to establish scatterometry as a traceable and absolute metrological method for dimensional measurements of nanostructured surfaces @xcite , some of them including the evaluation of measurements on test structures for line roughness @xcite .    at the physikalisch - technische bundesanstalt ( ptb ) , detailed scatterometric investigations of an euv photomask with periodic absorber line grating test patterns",
    "have been performed @xcite .",
    "it was feasible to derive the information on the line profile by means of rigorous numerical modelling @xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis of the uncertainty contributions in the structure reconstruction process @xcite revealed that structure disturbances such as line edge or line width roughness have significant impact on the angular distribution of the diffraction intensities @xcite .",
    "uncertainties in the actual intensity measurements are less important . in @xcite ,",
    "a debye - waller - type attenuation factor was found using a stochastic model of line roughness .",
    "it decreases the expectation value of the diffraction intensities perpendicular to the absorber lines .",
    "the calculations are based upon an analytical model describing the far - field diffraction of a disturbed 1d binary grating .",
    "the debye - waller factor found there was applied to the scattering of a patterned euv multilayer photomask , and the roughness values found showed a high correlation compared to the rms roughness measured by scanning electron microscopy @xcite . within a monte carlo simulation of the randomly disturbed euv line grating over several periods ,",
    "the exponential behaviour of the efficiency attenuation for the in - plane scattering has recently been confirmed @xcite .",
    "however , this recent treatment was for a 1d structure , which inherently only describes in - plane scatter between the diffraction orders .",
    "in realistic investigations of roughness in scatterometry @xcite also out - of - plane scatter has to be included .",
    "it will be shown that in the fraunhofer far - field approximation , the impact of the line roughness is given by a multiplicative term also for 2d structures . while scatterometry basically is the observation of the far - field ,",
    "the condition for the fraunhofer and kirchhoff approximations of the structures being substantially larger than the wavelength is not generally met , particularly not for optical scatterometry at state - of - the - art semiconductor structures .",
    "this condition is equivalent to the existence of several orders of diffraction .",
    "for the example presented here , euv scatterometry at structures of about 100 nm critical dimensions , it is met . even for structures smaller than the wavelength , the spatial wavelengths of the perturbations ( e.g. stitching errors ) may be larger than the wavelength and roughness induced scatter as described by the formalism presented here is observable . for small structures and small spatial wavelength perturbations ,",
    "however , no other diffraction orders than the zeroth order exist and other descriptions like the effective layer model @xcite must be used to account for roughness .    for periodic edge roughness",

    "this approach can be generalized to random roughness by using a fourier expansion of the rough contours . for the in - plane scatter",
    ", the correction factor converges for small roughness amplitudes to an exponential factor , as derived before in the 1d case . the analytical approach presented here",
    "is also compared with rigorous numerical calculations .",

    "the multilayer coating is terminated with a protective si / sio@xmath0 capping layer . on top of the multilayer ,",
    "an absorber stack is deposited , which is then structured by e - beam lithography .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section [ section_analytisch ] an analytical study of the 2d line roughness is presented . in order to evaluate the scatterometry measurements we use a fem based maxwell solver as simulation tool . in section [ sectionsimulation ]",

    "the grating is considered as an aperture with periodic slits which is irradiated by monochromatic radiation .",
