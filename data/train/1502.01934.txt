    "generalized unitarity @xcite is a method that has been tremendously successful in computing loop - level scattering amplitudes ( for a review see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "it is , therefore , natural to attempt to apply a similar method to the computation of correlation functions .",
    "there are different strategies that one can employ in doing this .",
    "one strategy is to apply generalized unitarity directly .",
    "this involves computing form factors and sewing them together to generalized unitarity cuts in momentum space . from the generalized unitarity cuts",
    "one can then construct the correlation functions in momentum space .",
    "finally the result is fourier transformed back into position space @xcite .",
    "this approach has many merits : form factors of some operators have been shown to have simple structures reminiscent of the ones found in scattering amplitudes @xcite , and , although the work cited here deals with @xmath0 super - yang - mills , it could easily be applied to other theories .",
    "unfortunately , correlation functions are best expressed in position space so some of the symmetries may not be apparent until after the fourier transform .",
    "nonetheless this approach is useful , and it will be helpful to us when dealing with supersymmetry",
    ".    our focus will be on a different strategy .",
    "we will start with a well - known position space method and try to reformulate it in a way that mimics generalized unitarity .",
    "the approach will thus not be an actual version of generalized unitarity .",
    "rather it will be a position space method inspired by generalized unitarity .",
    "the well - known position space method useful for this strategy is the lagrangian insertion procedure@xcite .",
    "this method will be reformulated to make it similar to generalized unitarity , and a notion of cuts in position space will be introduced .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that we stay in position space the whole time .",
    "this method will be applied to the super - correlators / super - amplitudes duality .",
    "the duality relates correlation functions of operators in the chiral part of the stress - tensor multiplet to scattering amplitudes at the level of the integrands in planar @xmath0 super - yang - mills @xcite .",
    "it was inspired by the duality between amplitudes and wilson loops @xcite whose supersymmetric version was found in @xcite .",
    "the duality between scattering amplitudes and wilson loops can be complicated at the quantum level because of the appearance of divergences needing to be regularized . in an attempt at clarifying matters ,",
    "it was made part of a triality with correlation functions in a special light - like limit being dual to wilson loops @xcite and at the integrand level to scattering amplitudes @xcite . in @xcite twistor space methods",
    "were used to prove the equivalence between the supersymmetric correlation functions and the wilson loop introduced in @xcite .",
    "the super - correlators / super - amplitudes duality provides a simple example to try out our approach as one can define generalized unitarity cuts for the dual scattering amplitudes .",
    "the cuts of the correlation functions will turn out to be equivalent to the generalized unitarity cuts of the dual scattering amplitudes as long as the duality is correct in the born approximation .",
    "the cuts will consist entirely of correlation functions of half - bps operators whose form factors we are going to need .",
    "the calculations will not depend on the number of operators / external states in the correlation functions / amplitudes .",
    "the duality between correlation functions and wilson loops has also been expanded to include additional operators @xcite .",
    "this duality has been discussed using feynman diagram techniques in @xcite and using twistor space methods in @xcite .",
    "even though there is no duality with scattering amplitudes , it might still be possible to compute the correlation functions with the cuts introduced here as we will discuss in the last part of the notes .",
    "the notes are structured as follows .",
    "section [ gu afsnit ] deals with generalized unitarity , lists the form factors we are going to need and gives a simple example on how to use generalized unitarity for correlation functions .",
    "section [ li afsnit ] deals with the lagrangian insertion procedure and introduces the notion of position space cuts .",
    "section [ duality afsnit ] deals with the duality and how to compute cuts for the correlation functions .",
    "section [ general afsnit ] discusses more general correlation functions and section [ diskussionsafsnit ] sums up the results .",
    "note that both position space and momentum spinors appear throughout this paper : section [ gu afsnit ] uses momentum spinors , section [ duality afsnit ] uses position space spinors and section [ susy afsnit ] uses both types of spinors .",
    "this paper only considers correlation functions in @xmath0 super yang - mills .",
    "apart from some comments in section [ general afsnit ] , the paper will focus exclusively on the planar theory . though the subject of the paper is cuts in position space",
    ", we also use standard generalized unitarity cuts in momentum space . in order to distinguish properly between the two",
    ", we will always use the term generalized unitarity cuts when refering to the momentum space quantities while cuts will always refer to the position space quantities .",
    "generalized unitarity is a method for computing perturbative quantities and has been used with great success to calculate scattering amplitudes .",
    "the method exploits information found at lower loop orders by setting internal propagators on - shell .",
    "formally , this can thought of as replacing specific propagators with delta functions :    @xmath1    these internal propagators will then act like external states . by replacing propagators inthis way , one can eventually reduce the scattering amplitude to a product of lower order amplitudes .",
    "the product of lower order amplitudes is called a generalized unitarity cut . from the generalized unitarity cut",
    "one can reconstruct the part of the amplitude that contains the specific propagators that were replaced by delta functions . in order to compute the full amplitude ,",
    "it is necessary to consider other generalized unitarity cuts until one has fully constrained the amplitude .    since generalized unitarity",
    "explicitly refer to propagators , it depends deeply on the existence of a feynman diagram representation .",
    "however it avoids using feynman rules directly . instead",
    ", on - shell amplitudes become the building blocks for the generalized unitarity cuts .",
    "this is advantageous as the on - shell amplitudes are often a lot simpler than the off - shell feynman rules would suggest .",
    "generalized unitarity can also be applied to objects containing local gauge - invariant operators such as correlation functions @xcite and form factors @xcite . since",
    "generalized unitarity is a momentum space method , the local operators will have to be fourier transformed .",
    "this introduces some off - shell momenta flowing into the generalized unitarity cuts .    in order to apply generalized unitarity to correlation functions requires form factors .",
    "form factors are quantities in between correlation functions and amplitudes as they contain both local operators and on - shell external states .",
    "they appear because the correlation functions contain gauge - invariant operators while the method itself introduces on - shell states .    for the duality between correlation functions and scattering amplitudes , the following operators are relevant",
    ":    @xmath2    here harmonic variables have been used to make the following projections :    @xmath3    of the super space , super charges and scalar fields respectively . in the above @xmath4",
    "are su(2 ) indices , @xmath5 is a spinor index and @xmath6 are the usual r - symmetry indices .",
    "we will follow the notation and conventions of @xcite closely with respect to both harmonic variables and spinors .",
    "some of the conventions can be found in appendix [ notationsappendix ] .",
    "the form factors for these operators are very simple as the operators respect part of the supersymmetry .",
    "they have been dealt with extensively in the papers @xcite . for our purposes",
    "we are only going to need mhv form factors as we will explain later .",
    "for @xmath7 the super - fourier transform of the mhv form factor is given by :    @xmath8    this particular operator is part of the stress - tensor multiplet .",
    "its highest component is the on - shell chiral lagrangian that will also appear as part of the lagrangian insertion procedure :    @xmath9    in order to write in terms of the super - space variables one has to do an inverse super - fourier transform :    @xmath10    so the on - shell chiral lagrangian correspond to the part of proportional to @xmath11 .    for @xmath12 mhv form factors will have a fermionic content that , in addition to the super - momentum conserving delta function .",
    "if we define the quantity @xmath13 as the form factor excluding the super - momentum conserving delta function :    @xmath14    then @xmath15 will be a polynomial of degree @xmath16 in @xmath17 .",
    "some interesting relations between the form factors for an operator @xmath18 and form factors for an operator @xmath19 were found in @xcite using bcfw recursion .",
    "however we are not interested in the explicit expressions for @xmath20 .",
    "we only need to know its degree , and that it conatins non - zero terms with @xmath21 factors of @xmath22 for any set of @xmath23 s .",
    "the second fact follow from simple feynman diagrams as there is always a non - zero form factor for @xmath24 with @xmath25 external scalars and any number of positive helicity gluons regardless of the ordering of the external states .",
    "conservation of super momentum can then be used to make @xmath20 independent of two of the @xmath26 s .",
    "the @xmath27 form factor can be written as follows :    @xmath28[23]\\cdots [ n1]}\\\\ & \\int \\left(\\prod_{j=1}^nd^4\\tilde{\\eta}_j\\right)e^{i\\sum_{j=1}^n\\eta_{ja}\\tilde{\\eta}^a_j}\\delta^4\\left((\\bar{\\imath})^a_{+a}\\sum_{r=1}^n\\eta_{ra}\\lambda_r^\\alpha\\right).\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    after performing the @xmath29-integrations , this formula becomes a grassmann polynomial of degree @xmath30 .",
    "for the case @xmath31 , it is equivalent to the mhv formula while for @xmath32 it is a grassmann polynomial of a higher degree than the mhv formula . unlike for scattering amplitudes where the three - point @xmath27 amplitude is a grassmann polynomial of only degree 4 , there are no special form factors for the operators in with a lower degree than the mhv formula .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     by inspecting the results from the literature , we see that at higher loop orders , it is always possible to make the insertion points light - like separated from four other points and let the points of the original operators be light - like separated from each other in pairs .",
    "so up to the known loop order , the correlation function should be determined by the cuts if we include cuts where the lagrangian insertions get replaced by @xmath33 .",
    "these new cuts may appear identical to applying twice .",
    "indeed if a lagrangian insertion is made light - like separated from two purely scalar operators using this relation , the result would be proportional to a correlation function with @xmath33 in place of the on - shell lagrangian .",
    "the difference lies in the fact that for these new cuts the operators made light - like from the lagrangian insertion may be light - like separated from only one other operator . as a consequence ,",
    "the factor being pulled out in front of the correlation function , when doing the cut , is different . for the relation",
    "this factor consists of spinor products and could be found through a fairly simple feynman diagram calculation .",
    "the computation needed for the additional cuts do not seem to be as simple , and the factor would involve tensors connecting the @xmath34 indices of the harmonic variables .",
    "the duality discussed in setion [ duality afsnit ] considers only planar diagrams so we only formulated cuts for the planar theory .",
    "however , it is also possible to consider non - planar cuts .",
    "equations and do in fact not rely on planarity so the grassmann structure of will be the same in the non - planar case .",
    "the kinematical factor can again be found from considering purely scalar operators , and the calculations will be very similar to the one leading to .",
    "for the sake of clarity , we only display the result with a limited number of operators though the generalization is straightforward .",
    "we have introduced an additional point @xmath35 and defined spinors such that @xmath36 , the limit needed for the cuts is then given by :    @xmath37{fler - punkt3 } \\end{minipage}\\nonumber\\\\ = & { } \\frac{1}{{\\bf ( i\\tilde{1})}}\\int d^4\\theta_{\\tilde{1}}\\delta^2(\\langle \\tilde{1}\\theta_{\\tilde{1}}^{+a}\\rangle-\\langle \\tilde{1}\\theta_i^a\\rangle(\\tilde{1})_a^{+a})\\bigg[\\frac{\\langle i-1i\\rangle}{\\langle i-1\\tilde{1}\\rangle\\langle \\tilde{1}i\\rangle}\\begin{minipage}{2.5 cm } \\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{fler - punkt4 } \\end{minipage}\\\\ & + \\frac{\\langle ji-1\\rangle}{\\langle j\\tilde{1}\\rangle\\langle \\tilde{1}i-1\\rangle}\\begin{minipage}{3 cm } \\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{fler - punkt5 } \\end{minipage}+\\frac{\\langle ij\\rangle}{\\langle i\\tilde{1}\\rangle\\langle \\tilde{1}j\\rangle}\\begin{minipage}{3 cm } \\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{fler - punkt6 } \\end{minipage}\\bigg].\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    one should note that outside the planar limit the cuts no longer separate the diagrams into separate patches as in section [ duality afsnit ] , though the cuts may still simplify the expression .",
    "in these notes , we have introduced a notion of cuts in position space and shown how this type of cuts on a specific set of limits of correlation functions correspond to generalized unitarity cuts of scattering amplitudes .",
    "this means that the super - correlators / super - amplitudes duality works on a cut - by - cut basis .",
    "we also checked that the super - correlators , considered in the duality , are in fact completely determined by the position space cuts .",
    "the results are hardly surprising as the supersymmetric correlation functions have been found to be dual to the supersymmetric wilson loop of @xcite , and since the duality between scattering amplitudes and correlation functions is at the integrand level , no regularization issues should arise .",
    "nonetheless , it provided a simple example to try out this reformulation of the lagrangian insertion technique .",
    "the position space cuts are written in terms of correlation functions of other half - bps operators but there is a non - trivial factor that emerges from doing the cut unlike for generalized unitarity where all the non - trivial information lies in the product of amplitudes .",
    "this might be a problem for more general correlation functions like the ones considered in section [ generic points afsnit ] .",
    "we identified a second type of cuts still written in terms of correlators of half - bps operators but with factors that do not follow as easily as for the cuts used in the duality .    in general",
    ", it would be interesting to extend this approach to other operators .",
    "it will certainly be possible to define the cuts but it is not clear if the correlators will be cut - constructible nor whether the cuts will be simple .",
    "the extension to non - planar diagrams is more straightforward though the cuts will no longer divide the feynman diagrams into separate patches .",
    "since the generalized unitarity methods are related the twistor space methods for scattering amplitudes , we expect that this approach is related to the twistor space methods used in @xcite , and it would be interesting to find the direct relation .",

    "in this appendix we briefly sum up some of the conventions and notations used .",
    "the harmonic variables are matrices satisfying the following relations :    @xmath38    upper - case latin indices are @xmath34 indices while lower - case latin indices are @xmath39 indices .",
    "since we will be dealing with operators at many different points it is convenient to use a notation that makes for an easy identification of the corresponding harmonic variables for each operator : we choose to denote the harmonic variables of the operator at point @xmath40 on the polygon by @xmath41 and the harmonic variables of the lagrangian insertion at point @xmath42 by @xmath43 .",
    "it is also useful to introduce this product of harmonic variables :    @xmath44    the product correspond to the determinant of the matrix :    @xmath45    as long as the product is non - zero it is possible to define the inverse matrix @xmath46 and by expressing @xmath34 vectors in terms of @xmath41 and @xmath47 it is possible to show that the following is the identity matrix :    @xmath48    we use greek letters from the beginning of the alphabet for spinor indices while @xmath49 and @xmath50 are reserved for regular lorentz indices .",
