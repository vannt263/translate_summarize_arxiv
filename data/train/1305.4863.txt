    "symbiotic stars are the longest orbital period interacting binaries composed of an evolved cool giant and an accreting hot , luminous companion ( usually a white dwarf , wd ) surrounded by a dense ionized nebula . depending on the nature of the cool giant , two main classes of symbiotic stars have been defined : s - types ( stellar ) with normal m giants , and orbital periods of the order of a few years , and d - types ( dusty ) with mira primaries surrounded by a warm dust ( whitelock 1987 ) .",
    "they host a rich circumstellar environment produced by the ionisation of the giant s high mass loss rate wind by the wd .",
    "several phenomena are observed including ionized and neutral regions , dust forming regions , accretion / excretion disks , interacting winds , and bipolar outflows and jets ( see e.g. mikoajewska 2007 , 2012 for recent reviews ) .",
    "symbiotic stars have obvious implications towards understanding all interacting binaries that include either evolved giants or accreting white dwarfs during any phase of their evolution . in particular , understanding symbiotic stars may also help to solve one of the timeliest problems in modern astrophysics - the missing progenitors of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) .",
    "although there is general consensus that they result from thermonuclear disruption of a co white dwarf reaching the chandrasekhar mass , either due to mass accretion from a non - degenerate companion ( single - degenerate or sd model ) or mass transfer between and/or merger of two white dwarfs ( double - degenerate or dd model ) , the progenitors of sne ia have never been observed before the explosion , and each of the proposed scenarios have their strengths and weaknesses ( di stefano , orio & moe 2013 , and references therein ) . in regard to this problem",
    ", symbiotic stars are important not only to the sd scenario , where the progenitor is most likely a symbiotic nova similar to rs oph ( e.g. dilday et al . 2012 ) , but also to the dd scenario since most dd binaries are descended from symbiotic stars ( e.g. di stefano 2010 ) .    driving the discovery for more symbiotic stars are two main factors .",
    "first , the potential to find other case studies like rs oph , and in particular , ensuring that the most interesting objects are routinely monitored for nova - like activity ( e.g. those with evidence for tidally distorted donors or orbital periods @xmath61000 days ; mikoajewska 2013 ) .",
    "second , to derive more realistic estimates of the total galactic symbiotic population and , in turn , to compare symbiotic star birth rates against sne ia rates .",
    "corradi et al .",
    "( 2010a ) and corradi ( 2012 ) identified the galactic bulge symbiotic stars as a fundamental population to better characterise before estimates of the total number of galactic symbiotics can be refined .",
    "current estimates vary considerably from 3@xmath7 ( allen 1984 ) , 3@xmath8 ( kenyon et al .",
    "1993 ) to 34@xmath9 ( munari & renzini 1992 ; magrini , corradi & munari 2003 ) . none of these , however , are in agreement with the very small number of observed symbiotic stars .",
    "several major catalogues have been compiled including allen ( 1984 ) , kenyon ( 1986 ) , mikoajewska , acker & stenholm ( 1997 ) and belczyski et al .",
    "these efforts have amounted to no more than @xmath3300 symbiotics currently known .",
    "more recently , @xmath31200 symbiotic star candidates were identified from the int photometric h@xmath0 survey of the northern galactic plane ( iphas , drew et al .",
    "spectroscopic follow - up of the sample has so far identified 14 new symbiotic stars ( corradi et al . 2008 , 2010a , 2010b , 2011 ; corradi & giammanco 2010 ; corradi 2012 ) .",
    "a comparable resource to iphas in the southern galactic plane is the aao / ukst supercosmos h@xmath0 survey ( shs , parker et al .",
    "the quantitative colour - colour candidate selection method developed by corradi et al .",
    "( 2008 ) is however problematic to adapt to the photographic shs data whose colour - colour plane possesses a greater intrinsic dispersion than iphas .",
    "the macquarie / aao / strasbourg h@xmath0 ( mash ) planetary nebulae ( pne ) surveys effectively used difference imaging ( parker et al .",
    "2006 ) and semi - automated techniques ( miszalski et al .",
    "2008 ) to identify unresolved shs h@xmath0 emitters ( e.g. compact pne , symbiotic stars and other emission - line stars ) . as the mash surveys were primarily concerned with pne , mostly those h@xmath0 emitters with the highest chance of being a pn were observed spectroscopically , leaving considerable scope for new symbiotic star discoveries .",
    "miszalski et al .",
    "( 2009a ) carefully selected a large sample of shs h@xmath0 emitters across @xmath335 square degrees towards the galactic bulge and observed them using the aaomega spectrograph ( sharp et al .",
    "2006 ) with the two - degree field ( 2df ) facility on the 3.9-m anglo - australian telescope ( lewis et al .",
    "a preliminary list of candidate symbiotic stars were published by miszalski et al .",
    "( 2009a ) , however only basic supporting information was given per object as the focus was only to flag non - pne .",
    "a similar approach to that of miszalski et al .",
    "( 2009a ) was taken in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) by miszalski et al .",
    "( 2011b ) where some promising symbiotic star candidates were identified .",
    "this paper contains a comprehensive reanalysis of the h@xmath0 emitter survey that incorporates deep spectroscopy and long term @xmath10-band lightcurves to identify new symbiotic stars and other unusual h@xmath0 emission line stars .",
    "it is structured as follows .",
    "section [ sec : obs ] describes the selection of h@xmath0 emission line candidates and the spectroscopic and photometric observations of the sample .",
    "the overall properties and analysis of the sample are discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : sample ] .",
    "a subset of the sample are discussed individually in sections [ sec : stypes ] ( new s - type symbiotics ) , [ sec : dtypes ] ( new d - type symbiotics ) , [ sec : ddtypes ] ( a new d@xmath2-type symbiotic ) , [ sec : pstypes ] ( possible s - type symbiotics ) and [ sec : pdtypes ] ( possible d - type symbiotics ) .",
    "objects that were found not to be symbiotic stars are also discussed individually in sections [ sec : egb6 ] ( high density core pne ) , [ sec : other ] ( miscellaneous objects ) and appendix [ sec : superpos ] ( superpositions ) .",
    "section [ sec : discussion ] discusses the completeness and depth of our survey , possible x - ray detections , the unique carbon mira of h1 - 45 and its significance in carbon star formation , as well as the common tendencies as a function of symbiotic star type .",
    "we conclude in sect .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] and several appendices contain finder charts and other observations of the sample .",
    "we employ the same multi - object spectroscopy observations previously described by miszalski et al .",
    "( 2009a ) .",
    "the main observations were conducted in service - mode ( pi : miszalski ) using the 4-m anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) with the 2df / aaomega facility ( lewis et al . 2002 ; sharp et al .",
    "2006 ) that can allocate up to 392 optical fibres of 2.1  diameter to science targets over a 2.1@xmath11 diameter field of view .",
    "additional observations were made using the 8.2-m very large telescope ( vlt ) with the flames facility ( pasquini et al .",

    "flames was used in the miniature integral field unit ( mini - ifu ) mode that can allocate up to 15 mini - ifus for both science and sky targets over a 12.5  field of view .",
    "each mini - ifu consists of a lenslet array that measures @xmath12 arcsec@xmath1 which feeds 20 fibres with a spatial sampling of 0.5  per lenslet .",
    "tables [ tab : aaomega ] and [ tab : flames ] give the field centres of 2df / aaomega and vlt flames observations where most fibres were allocated to pne to determine whether such observations were appropriate for measuring their nebular chemical abundances ( miszalski 2009 ) and the remainder to h@xmath0 emission line candidates .",
    "field centres were chosen to maximise the number of catalogued pne in each field .",
    "most aaomega fields were observed with a large number of sky fibres ( last column of tab .",
    "[ tab : aaomega ] ) to assist in subtracting the highly variable sky background .",
    "targets for spare fibres were chosen by inspection of full - resolution imaging data from the shs and supercosmos sky survey ( sss , hambly et al .",
