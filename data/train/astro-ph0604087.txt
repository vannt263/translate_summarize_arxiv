    "questions such as whether the universe will expand forever or eventually re - collapse and end with a big crunch , and what its shape and size may be , are among the most fundamental challenges in cosmology . regarding the former question ,",
    "it is well known that the ultimate fate of the universe is intrinsically associated with the nature of its dominant components . in the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) class of models , for instance , a universe that is dominated by a pressureless fluid ( as , e.g. , baryons and/or dark matter ) or any kind of fluid with positive pressure ( as radiation , for example ) will expand forever if its spatial geometry is euclidean or hyperbolic , or will eventually re - collapse if it is spherical .",
    "this predictable destiny for the universe , however , may be completely modified if it is currently dominated by some sort of negative - pressure dark component , as indicated by a number of independent observational results ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this case ,",
    "not only the dynamic but also the thermodynamic fate of the universe may be completely different , with the possibility of an eternally expanding closed model  @xcite , an increasingly hot expanding universe  @xcite or even a progressive rip - off of the large and small scale structure of matter ending with the occurrence of a curvature singularity , the so - called big smash  @xcite .",
    "the remaining questions , concerning the shape and size of our @xmath2dimensional world , go in turn beyond the scope of general relativity ( gr ) , since they have an intrinsically topological nature . in this way , approaches or answers to these questions",
    "are ultimately associated with measurements of the _ global _ structure ( topology ) of the universe and , as a _",
    "metric theory , gr can not say much about it , leaving the global topology of the universe undetermined . over the past few years , several aspects of the cosmic topology have become topical ( see , e.g. , the review articles ref .",
    "@xcite ) , given the wealth of increasingly accurate cosmological observations , especially the recent results from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) experiment  @xcite , which have heightened the interest in the possibility of a universe with a nontrivial spatial topology .    a pertinent question the reader may ask at this point is whether the current values of cosmological density parameters , which help us to answer the above first question ( associated with the ultimate fate of the universe ) , can be constrained by a possible detection of the spatial topology of the universe .",
    "our primary objective here is to address this question by focusing our attention on possible topological constraints on the density parameters associated with the baryonic / dark matter ( @xmath0 ) and dark energy ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "motivated by the best fit value for the total energy density @xmath3 ( @xmath4 level ) reported by wmap team @xcite , which includes a positively curved universe as a realistic possibility , we shall consider globally homogeneous spherical manifolds , some of which account for the suppression of power at large scales observed by wmap  @xcite , and also fits the wmap temperature two - point correlation function  @xcite . to this end , in the next section we present our basic context and prerequisites , while in the last section we discuss our main results and present some concluding remarks .",
    "within the framework of standard cosmology , the universe is described by a space - time manifold @xmath5 with a locally homogeneous and isotropic robertson  walker ( rw ) metric @xmath6 \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , or @xmath9 depends on the sign of the constant spatial curvature ( @xmath10 , respectively ) .",
    "the @xmath2space @xmath11 is usually taken to be one of the following simply - connected spaces : euclidean @xmath12 , spherical @xmath13 , or hyperbolic @xmath14 . however , given that the simple - connectedness of our space @xmath11 has not been established , our @xmath2space may equally well be any one of the possible quotient manifolds @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a fixed point - free group of isometries of the covering space @xmath17 .",
    "thus , for example , in a universe whose geometry of the spatial section is euclidean ( @xmath18 ) , besides @xmath19 there are 6 classes of topologically distinct compact orientable @xmath2spaces @xmath11 that admits this geometry , while for universes with either spherical ( @xmath20 ) and hyperbolic ( @xmath21 ) spatial geometries there is an infinite number of topologically non - homeomorphic ( inequivalent ) manifolds with nontrivial topology that can be endowed with these geometries .",
    "quotient manifolds are compact in three independent directions , or compact in two or at least one independent direction . in compact manifolds , any two given points may be joined by more than one geodesic .",
    "since the radiation emitted by cosmic sources follows geodesics , the immediate observational consequence of a nontrivial detectable spatial topology of @xmath11 is that the sky may show multiple images of radiating sources : cosmic objects or specific correlated spots of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) . at very large scales ,",
    "the existence of these multiple images ( or pattern repetitions ) is a physical effect that can be used to probe the @xmath2-space topology . in this work ,",
    "we use the so - called  circles - in - the - sky \" method ( for cosmic crystallographic methods see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , which relies on multiple copies of correlated circles in the cmbr maps  @xcite , whose existence is clear from the following reasoning : in a space with a detectable nontrivial topology , the last scattering sphere ( lss ) intersects some of its topological images along pairs of circles of equal radii , centered at different points on the lss , with the same distribution of temperature fluctuations , @xmath22 .",
    "since the mapping from the lss to the night sky sphere preserves circles  @xcite , these pairs of matching circles will be inprinted on the cmbr temperature fluctuations sky maps regardless of the background geometry and detectable topology . as a consequence , to observationally probe a nontrivial topology on the available largest scale , one should scrutinize the full - sky cmb maps in order to extract the correlated circles , whose angular radii and relative position of their centers can be used to determine the topology of the universe .",
    "thus , a nontrivial topology of the space section of the universe may be observed , and can be probed through the circles - in - the - sky for all locally homogeneous and isotropic universes with no assumption on the cosmological density parameters .",
    "let us now state our basic cosmological assumptions and fix some notation .",
    "in addition to the rw metric ( [ rwmetric ] ) , we assume that the current matter content of the universe is well approximated by cold dark matter ( cdm ) of density @xmath23 plus a cosmological constant @xmath24 . in this standard @xmath24cdm context , for nonflat spaces",
    "the scale factor @xmath25 can be identified with the curvature radius of the spatial section of the universe at time @xmath26 , which is given by @xmath27 where here and in what follows the subscript @xmath28 denotes evaluation at present time @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the hubble constant , and @xmath31 is the total density at @xmath26 . in this way ,",
    "for nonflat spaces the distance @xmath32 of any point with coordinates @xmath33 to the origin ( in the covering space ) _ in units of the curvature radius _ , @xmath34 , reduces to @xmath35 where @xmath36 is an integration variable , and @xmath37 . throughout this paper",
    "we shall measure the lengths in unit of curvature radius @xmath38 .",
    "a typical characteristic length of nonflat manifolds @xmath11 , which we shall use in this paper , is the so - called injectivity radius @xmath39 , which is defined as the radius of the smallest sphere ` inscribable ' in @xmath11 .",
    "an important mathematical result is that @xmath39 , expressed in terms of the curvature radius , is a constant ( topological invariant ) for any given spherical and hyperbolic manifolds .    in this work",
    "we shall focus our attention in globally homogeneous spherical manifolds , as presented in table  [ singleaction ] ( see also its caption for more details ) .",
    "these manifolds satisfy a topological principle of homogeneity , in the sense that all points in @xmath11 are topologically equivalent .",
    ".the globally homogeneous spherical manifolds are of the form @xmath40 .",
    "the first column gives the name we use for the manifolds .",
    "the second column displays the covering groups @xmath16 .",
    "finally , the remaining columns present the order of the group @xmath16 and the injectivity radius @xmath39 .",
    "the cyclic and binary dihedral cases actually constitute families of manifolds , whose members are given by the different values of the integers @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the order of @xmath16 gives the number of fundamental polyhedra needed to fulfill the whole covering space @xmath13 .",
    "thus , for example , for the manifold @xmath43 which is the the well - known poincar dodecahedral space , the fundamental polyhedron is a regular spherical dodecahedron , @xmath44 of which tile the @xmath2sphere into identical cells that are copies of the fp . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "to investigate the extent to which a possible detection of a nontrival topology may place constraints on the cosmological density parameters , we consider here the globally homogeneous spherical manifolds . in these @xmath2spaces",
    "the number of pairs of matching circles depends on the ratio of the injectivity radius @xmath39 to the radius @xmath45 of lss , which in turn depends on the density parameters ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for examples of specific estimates of this number regarding @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath43 ) . nevertheless , if the topology of a globally homogeneous spherical manifold is detectable the correlated pairs will be antipodal , i.e. the centers of correlated circles are separated by @xmath48 , as shown in figure  [ cinthesky1 ] .",
    "clearly the distance between the centers of each pair of the _ first _ correlated circles is twice the injectivity radius @xmath39 .",
    "now , a straightforward use of known trigonometric rules to the right - angled spherical triangle shown in figure  [ cinthesky1 ] yields a relation between the angular radius @xmath49 and the angular sides @xmath39 and radius @xmath45 of the last scattering sphere , namely @xmath50 where @xmath39 is a topological invariant , whose values are given in table  [ singleaction ] , and the distance @xmath45 of the last scattering surface to the origin in units of the curvature radius is given by  ( [ redshift - dist ] ) with @xmath51  @xcite .    0.1 in    equations  ( [ cosalpha ] ) along with ( [ redshift - dist ] )",
    "give the relations between the angular radius @xmath49 and the cosmological density parameters @xmath1 and @xmath52 , and thus can be used to set bounds on these parameters . to quantify this",
    "we proceed in the following way .",
    "firstly , as an example , we assume the angular radius @xmath53 . secondly , since the measurements of the radius @xmath49 unavoidably involve observational uncertainties , in order to obtain very conservative results we take @xmath54 . and its uncertainty . ]    in order to study the effect of the cosmic topology on the density parameters",
    "@xmath55 and @xmath56 , we consider the binary tetrahedral @xmath46 and the binary octahedral @xmath47 spatial topologies ( see table  [ singleaction ] ) , to reanalyze with these two topological priors the constraints on these parameters that arise from the so - called _ gold _ sample of 157 sne ia , as compiled by riess _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , along with the latest chandra measurements of the x - ray gas mass fraction in 26 x - ray luminous , dynamically relaxed galaxy clusters ( spanning the redshift range @xmath57 ) as provided by allen _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite ( see also @xcite for details on sne ia and x - ray statistics ) .",
    "the @xmath46 and @xmath47 spatial topology is added to the conventional sne ia plus clusters data analysis as a gaussian prior on the value of @xmath45 , which can be easily obtained from an elementary combination of  ( [ cosalpha ] ) and  ( [ redshift - dist ] ) . in other words ,",
    "the contribution of the topology to @xmath58 is a term of the form @xmath59 .",
    "-0.2 cm -0.2 cm    figures 2b and 2c ( central and right panels ) show the results of our statistical analysis .",
    "confidence regions  68.3% and 95.4% confidence limits ( c.l . )",
    " in the parametric space @xmath52@xmath56 are displayed for the above described combination of observational data . for the sake of comparison",
    ", we also show in fig .",
    "2a the @xmath52@xmath56 plane for the conventional sne ia plus galaxy clusters analysis , i.e. , the one without the above cosmic topology assumption . by comparing both analyses ,",
    "it is clear that a nontrivial space topology reduces considerably the parametric space region allowed by the current observational data , and also breaks some degeneracies arising from the current sne ia and x - ray gas mass fraction measurements . at 95.4% c.l .",
    "our sne ia+x - ray+topology analysis provides @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( binary octahedral @xmath62 ) and @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( binary tetrahedral @xmath65 ) .    concerning the above analysis it is worth emphasizing three important aspects .",
    "first , that the best - fit values depend weakly on the value used for radius @xmath49 of the circle .",
    "second , the uncertainty @xmath66 alters predominantly the area corresponding to the confidence regions , without having a significant effect on the best - fit values .",
    "third , we also notice that there is a topological degeneracy in that the same best fits and confidence regions for , e.g. , the @xmath46 topology , would equally arise from either @xmath67 or @xmath68 spatial topology .",
    "similarly , @xmath47 , @xmath69 and @xmath68 give rise to identical bounds on the density parameters .",
    "this kind of topological degeneracy passed unnoticed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "finally , we emphasize that given the wealth of increasingly accurate cosmological observations , especially the recent results from the wmap , and the development of methods and strategies in the search for cosmic topology , it is reasonable to expect that we should be able to detect it . besides it importance as a major scientific achievement , we have shown through concrete examples that the knowledge of the spatial topology allows to place constraints on the density parameters associated to dark matter ( @xmath0 ) and dark energy ( @xmath1 ) .",
