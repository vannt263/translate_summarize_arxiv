    "strangeness adds yet another  still largely unexplored  dimension to hadronic physics . for nucleons in free space ,",
    "their strange - quark content has received considerable attention as a result of the measurement of the spin - dependent structure function of the proton by the european muon collaboration ( emc )  @xcite .",
    "some analyses of the experiment suggest that a large portion of the spin of the proton is carried by strange quarks . in the opposite , high - density , domain a copious production of strangeness",
    "is predicted as soon as the fermi energy of the system becomes large enough for the addition of strange quarks to become energetically favorable  @xcite .",
    "thus , one expects a substantial increase in the strangeness - per - baryon ratio with density .",
    "in addition to its obvious relevance to nuclear physics , high - density matter appeals to many other branches of physics , such as astrophysics , cosmology and particle physics .",
    "indeed , the high - density environment found at the core of neutron stars is speculated to constitute a fruitful ground for the formation of exotic states of matter  such as a kaon condensate and strange - quark matter .",
    "motivated by these fundamental issues a large number of experimental facilities are devoting valuable resources to elucidate them .",
    "however , before a clear picture of these exotic phenomena will emerge , it is necessary to understand phenomena at or near normal nuclear - matter density .",
    "the formation of hypernuclei appears to be an important first step .",
    "moreover , because hyperon - nucleon scattering experiments are difficult to perform , hypernuclear physics appears to be an attractive alternative for testing  and for extending off the mass shell  models of the elementary nucleon - hyperon and hyperon - hyperon interaction .",
    "indeed , a vast number of experiments have been devoted  @xcite to study the formation , the spectroscopy and the decay of hypernuclei .    to date",
    ", hypernuclei have been typically produced through strangeness - exchange reactions using hadronic probes  such as in @xmath4 and @xmath5 scattering  and decay through nonleptonic weak processes which involve the emission of nucleons and pions .",
    "these experiments have been analyzed from a variety of different theoretical perspectives .",
    "for example , microscopic meson - exchange models have been constructed which accurately reproduce the rich nucleon - nucleon and the more scarce hyperon - nucleon data  @xcite .",
    "other approaches , more closely connected to the underlying symmetries of qcd , are based on effective field theories that include the baryon octet and several nonstrange and strange mesons  @xcite . with such models available , binding energies and single - particle spectra of hypernuclei",
    "have been computed in the context of nonrelativistic  @xcite and relativistic mean - field models @xcite .",
    "the underlying assumption in the mean - field approach is that the dynamical aspects of the production and decay process can be ignored , so that the hypernucleus may be approximated as a core of nucleons with one strange baryon added to the system .",
    "if the hyperon has been produced from a closed - shell nucleus this approximation constitutes the simple particle - hole model .",
    "yet one must take this simplified description with caution as the real picture is vastly more complicated .",
    "indeed , it is widely recognized that the nuclear resonances populated through these reactions are often highly excited ( particle - hole ) states that may decay electromagnetically prior to their weak decay .",
    "moreover , initial- and final - state interactions between the nucleus and the hadronic probes are strong and must be included .",
    "these aspects add considerable complexity to any theoretical description .",
    "although the gross features of hypernuclear spectra may indeed be explained on the basis of a simple particle - hole picture , the fine details require the incorporation of distortions as well as of few- and many - body correlation effects  @xcite .    with the advent of continuous electron beam facilities , such as the thomas jefferson national accelerator facility ( tjnaf ) ,",
    "the formation of hypernuclear states through the photoproduction of charged kaons has become a reality  @xcite .",
    "the production of hypernuclei via hadronic or photo - nuclear reactions is a complicated process involving not only nucleons and hyperons but also several baryon resonances and strange mesons .",
    "in contrast to the hadronic production , however , the @xmath6-photoproduction process is relatively insensitive to distortion effects .",
    "this represents an enormous theoretical simplification .",
    "still , additional simplifications and approximations are often needed .",
    "for example , in order to keep the influence of the nuclear environment on a tractable level , most theoretical studies resort to the impulse approximation : the assumption that the elementary process suffers no modification as it is embedded in the nuclear medium .",
    "( note that the free - space production operator could suffer considerably from model and parameter dependencies  @xcite . )",
    "further , if distortion effects can be neglected  an excellent approximation in the @xmath6-photoproduction case  then as in the case of electron scattering , the theoretical amplitude may be decomposed into a nuclear structure part and a production operator  @xcite .",
    "the production operator contains the specific details of the reaction , including various meson - baryon vertices and form factors .",
    "it is obtained from the corresponding @xmath7-matrix describing the reaction on a single nucleon in free space .",
    "the nuclear structure part involves the response of the nuclear ground state in the form of several polarization insertions describing the propagation of a nucleon - hole and a @xmath8(@xmath9)-particle through the nuclear medium .",
    "using this point of view , we study hypernuclear spectra using a random - phase approximation ( rpa ) to a generalized relativistic mean - field model @xcite . more specifically , baryonic matter is assumed to consist of strange as well as non - strange hadrons . at , or near , nuclear - matter saturation density  and for phenomenologically consistent hyperon - meson couplings  the presence of hyperons in the ground state is suppressed by their larger mass .",
    "thus , at these densities one recovers the normal [ strangeness - equal - zero ( @xmath10 ) ] nuclear ground state .",
    "hypernuclear states , as well as any other nuclear excitation , then emerge from the consistent response of this mean - field ground state to a suitable external probe .",
    "that is , we propose to treat strangeness no different than any other intrinsic nuclear quantum number . moreover , as the rpa is the consistent response of the mean - field ground state , all nuclear states  those with @xmath10 and @xmath11 alike  are obtained by correlating the particle - hole pair via their residual interaction .",
    "the importance of many - body correlations beyond the simple particle - hole picture was realized soon after precise hypernuclear measurements were available  @xcite .",
    "for example , mixing of particle - hole states that couple to the same angular momentum is essential for predicting angular distributions in strangeness exchange reactions  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , states with nucleon holes in the deepest bound nucleon shells are not recognized in the experiments because of their large widths , a feature which can not be explained by simple mean - field models  @xcite .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ lagrangian ] , we present the effective lagrangian which contains the relevant baryon - meson vertices .",

    "indeed , a calculation of the isoscalar - dipole response to lowest - order is flawed by the presence of spurious strength associated with the uniform translation of the center of mass .",
    "in contrast , a consistent rpa calculation  one that uses the same interaction in the calculation of the mean - field ground - state than in the calculation of the response  eliminates this anomalous behavior by shifting all spurious strength to zero excitation energy .    in the previous section a spectral decomposition of the feynman propagator",
    "was presented .",
    "although such a decomposition is useful for understanding the spectral content of the nuclear response , in practice it suffers from too much reliance on artificial cutoffs .",
    "an efficient scheme that avoids the introduction of artificial cutoffs is the non - spectral approach .",
    "moreover , a non - spectral formalism has the added advantage that , at least in principle , the positive - energy continuum may be treated exactly .",
    "the non - spectral generation of the feynman propagator amounts to solving the following inhomogeneous dirac equation @xmath79g_{f}({\\bf x},{\\bf y};\\omega)=    \\delta({\\bf x}-{\\bf y } ) \\ ; ,   \\label{diraceq}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is in general a complex variable and the mean - field potential , or baryon self - energy , is given by @xmath80 the quantities @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 contain the nuclear scalar , vector and tensor potentials generated at the mean - field level .",

    "[ fig : ox5 ] with opposite parity are of transverse - electric character . compared to the longitudinal response ,",

    "the experimental spectrum @xcite observed in the @xmath4 reaction on @xmath129ca exhibits three peaks .",
    "two at @xmath130 and 189 mev which in the simple particle - hole picture are identified as @xmath119 states with the particle - hole assignments @xmath131 and @xmath132 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , a peak at 180 mev which is identified as a @xmath120 state with the assignment @xmath133 .",
    "however , because of the strong mixing it is not possible to attribute the peaks to specific states if correlations are taken into account . to make contact with the experimental observations fig .",
    "[ fig : ca2 ] shows the difference between the mean field result and the rpa prediction .",
    "we remind the reader that the very small width of the states is an idealization and that in a more realistic scenario the peaks are considerably broader .",
    "it can be expected that the two group of states around 191 mev and 197 mev in the rpa coalesce to form the resonance structure found in the experimental data .",
    "similar as in the case of oxygen , the remnant of the particle - hole state with the neutron in the deepest bound @xmath134 shell moves into the continuum .",
    "based on hadronic reactions , transverse modes , including states of unnatural parity , are of minor importance in hypernuclear spectroscopy .",
    "because of their small strength , these states are usually not observed in the kinematic range covered by the experiments @xcite . as an attractive alternative",
    ", states of unnatural parity may be studied in electromagnetic production of hypernuclei . in our approach",
    "unnatural parity states can exclusively be studied in the kaon response function . under the assumption that the hypernuclei states are created in hyperon photoproduction off a proton ,",
    "a different range for the momentum transfer has to be considered . with the kinematics forced on the problem the momenta",
    "are generally much higher than in the hadronic reactions . however , for the outgoing kaon in forward direction the momentum transfer decreases with increasing photon energy @xcite and @xmath135 mev is sufficient .",
    "the rpa results for initial oxygen and calcium nuclei are indicated in fig.[fig : ox3 ] and fig.[fig : ca3 ] at @xmath136mev .",
    "consistent with the observation for the unnatural parity states in the transverse @xmath106 response , the residual interaction is rather weak .",
    "this can be studied in fig .",
    "[ fig : ox4 ] which compares the mean field and rpa predictions for @xmath137 .",
    "the labels indicate the particle - hole states on the mean field level . because of the very weak spin - orbit force felt by the hyperons ,",
    "the states with the @xmath8 in the @xmath138 or @xmath139 are almost degenerate and coalesce in the figure .",
    "although the results for the kaon response are consistent with the observations for the transverse @xmath112 response , a more unified treatment is desirable .",
    "going beyond our first contribution to the subject , one must allow for mixing between spin - longitudinal and spin - transverse modes .",
    "either on a phenomenological level by introducing a landau - migdal parameter , or by incorporating higher - order feynman diagrams , this will be an important topic for future investigations .",
    "in this paper we studied strangeness - changing response functions as an alternative approach to hypernuclear structure .",
    "in contrast to the traditional mean - field description , where hypernuclear states are uncorrelated hyperon - particle  nucleon - hole excitations , they are treated as any other nuclear excitation that emerges from the response of normal nuclei to external probes . from this point of view we studied hypernuclear spectra using a relativistic random - phase approximation based on a chiral lagrangian which successfully reproduces properties of normal nuclei and where all relevant meson - baryon vertices are constrained by su(3)-flavor symmetry .",
    "the response of the nuclear ground state involves several polarization insertions describing the propagation of a nucleon - hole and a @xmath8(@xmath9)-particle through the nuclear medium . to specify the residual particle - hole interaction we assumed that it is mediated by the two lightest @xmath0 mesons , namely the kaon and its vector partner the @xmath1 .",
    "this lead us to introduce two strangeness - changing response functions . a vector @xmath112 response and a pseudo - vector kaon response .",
    "many - body correlations are included by iterating the lowest - order response to infinite order .",
    "the primary difference of the two response functions lies in the structure of their excitation spectra . due to pseudo - vector character of the @xmath105 vertex ,",
    "the kaon exclusively excites hypernuclear states of unnatural parity .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath112 response contains  with the exception of the @xmath140 state ",
    "hypernuclear states of all spin and parities .",
    "we analyzed hypernuclear spectra for @xmath121o and @xmath129ca nuclei under the assumption that a nucleon in the ground state is replaced by a @xmath8 particle .",
    "for the longitudinal @xmath112 response , which is primarily determined in the hadronic strangeness - exchange reactions such as @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the rpa leads to important corrections over the simple particle - hole predictions .",
    "first , the repulsive character of the residual interaction decreases the uncorrelated hypernuclear binding energies considerably .",
    "this generates the characteristic `` quenching and hardening '' of the response .",
    "second , we observed important qualitative corrections in the spectra , as the strong residual interaction mixes single - particles states of different particle - hole content but of the same spin and parity .",
    "consequently , in most cases it is no longer possible to attribute the excitations to a specific particle - hole transition .",
    "furthermore , states with nucleons holes in the deepest bound nucleon shell move into the continuum consistent with the experimental observation . in contrast to the longitudinal response , correlation effects are modest in the transverse part of the @xmath112 response .",
    "we also examined the pseudo - vector kaon response responsible for generating hypernuclear states of unnatural parity . in this first study of the spin - longitudinal modes we observed small corrections over the simple particle - hole picture , in analogy to our observations for the spin - transverse @xmath112 response . in the future we plan to study this kaonic response in a much more comprehensive way .",
    "our goal will be to establish a dynamical range for which the kaonic enhancement  a precursor to the kaon - condensed state  may be observed . to this end",
    "the upcoming nuclear @xmath6-photoproduction experiments at tjanf may be of direct relevance to our quest  @xcite .",
    "indeed , by measuring an enhancement of the photoproduction background , relative to that from a single - nucleon , these experiments may shed light on the exotic and novel states of matter speculated to exist at the core of neutron stars .",
