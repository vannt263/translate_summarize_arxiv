    "in addition , both models exhibit large event - by - event fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the jet - energy loss can either be described as multiple scatterings of the parton @xcite , specific for a weakly - coupled pqcd medium , or using the ads / cft correspondence where the problem of a parton stopped in a thermal medium is related to the problem of a string falling into a @xmath3-dimensional black hole @xcite .",

    "to further study the differences of a pqcd and an ads / cft - like energy loss , we investigate the role of the energy dependence in the energy - loss prescription , examine the power of the path - length dependence , and calculate higher - jet harmonics .",
    "we want to examine if a generic energy - loss ansatz that includes both a path - length and an energy dependence confirms the above conclusion that only cgc initial conditions and an ads / cft energy - loss can describe both the @xmath12 and the @xmath13 appropriately .    in the high - temperature limit , all dependences on the intrinsic scales of the system ( @xmath14 , etc . )",

    "thus , it is important to note that the @xmath43 of high-@xmath0 particles is sensitive to short - distance properties , suggesting that there is either weak coupling with a @xmath78  fm or strong coupling which in itself features the suppression of energy loss at early times .    extending the analysis to dijets and calculating the @xmath68",

    "@xcite .",
    "since the energy loss calculated by ads / cft @xcite clearly states that @xmath29 is only a lower limit , this raises the question which power in the jet path - length dependece has to be included when an ads / cft - like energy loss is considered .",
    "a detailed discussion of this issue will follow in the next subsection ( see the fig .  [ expfig ] ) .    before that",
