    "the top quark was first observed at ferminlab tevatron in 1995 @xcite and is by far the heaviest elementary fermion . due to the large mass",
    ", the top quark decays rapidly before forming any hadronic bound state .",
    "furthermore , the top quark has many properties different from other quarks , so it occupies a special position in the standard model(sm ) and is often speculated to be sensitive to the new physics . for these reasons , probing the properties of the top quark is always one of the forefront topics at the various high energy collider .",
    "the twin higgs theories use a discrete symmetry in combination with an approximate global symmetry to stabilize the higgs mass .",
    "this mechanism can be implemented in left - right models with the discrete left - right symmetry @xcite . in the left - right twin higgs(lrth ) model , a vector - like top quark is introduced in order to give the top quark a mass of the order of electroweak scale .",
    "there is mixing between the sm - like top quark and the heavy top quark so that the top quark couplings can be modified . at the lhc ,",
    "a single vector - like top quark can be produced dominantly via s - channel or t - channel @xmath5 or @xmath6 exchange , while the production of the vector - like top quark pair can be produced dominantly from gluon exchange .",
    "the productions and decays of the vector - like top quark at the lhc have been described in detail in refs.@xcite .",
    "if this effect can be detected , it will be the most compelling evidence of the new physics .    duo to the complicated qcd background , the measurement precision of the lhc is limited .",
    "by contrast , the background of the international linear collider(ilc ) is very clean so that it will allow unique opportunities to study the properties and interactions of the sm top quark and vector - like top quark .",
    "besides the @xmath7 collider mode , the @xmath8 or @xmath9 collider mode can be realized by the backward compton scattering at the ilc@xcite .",
    "the search for deviations from the sm couplings in single top quark production has become one of the main focus in the on - going and forthcoming collider experiments@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we study the process @xmath0 , the results will be helpful to test the sm and the lrth model .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we give a brief review of the lrth model .",
    "in sec.iii we calculate the production cross section of the process @xmath0 and the differential distributions of several observables at the ilc .",
    "finally , we give our conclusions and some comments in sec.iv .",
    "the lrth model was first proposed in ref.@xciteand some phenomenological analye and the feynman rules have been studied in ref.@xcite . in this section",
    "we will briefly review the essential features of the lrth model related to our work .    in the lrth model ,",
    "the global symmetry is @xmath10 , with a diagonal subgroup @xmath11 gauged .",
    "two higgs fields , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , are introduced and each transforms as @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively under the global symmetry .",
    "they are written as @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are two component objects which are charged under the @xmath11 as @xmath19 after higgses develop vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) as @xmath20 and @xmath21 , which break the @xmath10 global symmetry as well as the gauge symmetry @xmath22 down to the sm @xmath23 .",
    "after the electroweak breaking of @xmath24 , three goldstone bosons are eaten by the massive gauge bosons @xmath25 and @xmath26 in the sm , their masses can be given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29gev is the electroweak scale , @xmath30 is the sm hypercharge coupling , @xmath31 is the @xmath32 mass , the values of @xmath33 and @xmath34 will be bounded from below by electroweak precision measurements .    in order to give the top quark mass of the order of the electroweak scale , a pair of vector - like quarks @xmath35 and @xmath36 is introduced .",
    "the mass eigenstates , which contain one of the sm - like top quark @xmath37 and a heavy top partner @xmath38 , are mixtures of the gauge eigenstates .",
    "their masses are given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "at the leading order , the mixing angles for the left - handed and right - handed fermions are @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the mass parameter essential to the mixing between the top quark @xmath37 and its partner @xmath38 .",
    "in the left - right twin higgs model.,width=415 ]    at a linear collider the single vector - like top quarks can be produced from the following two processes : @xmath43 where the photon comes from the original incoming electron and positron , respectively .",
    "the relevant feynman diagrams of the process @xmath0 in the lrth model are shown in fig.1 .",
    "the invariant production amplitudes of the process @xmath44 can be written as : @xmath45 with @xmath46 where @xmath47 denotes the three - point vertices of the particles , the relevant feynman rules can be found in ref.@xcite .    with the above amplitudes",
    ", we can directly obtain the production cross section @xmath48 for the subprocess @xmath0 , which can be obtained by folding @xmath49 with the photon distribution function@xcite : @xmath50 where @xmath51,\\ ] ] with @xmath52 where @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the incident electron and laser light energies , and @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath57 vanishes for @xmath58 .",
    "we require @xmath59 , which implies that @xmath60 .",
    "we choose @xmath61 , then obtain @xmath62 for simplicity , the possible polarization for the electron and photon beams have been ignored , and the number of the backscattered photons produced per electron is assumed to be one .",
    "we take the sm parameters used in our calculations as@xcite @xmath63    the relevant lrth parameters in our calculation are the scale @xmath33 , the mass parameter @xmath42 and the heavy top quark mass @xmath64 .",
    "recently , the atlas collaboration presented a search that vector - like top quark with mass lower than 656 gev is excluded at 95% confidence level@xcite .",
    "earlier , the cms collaboration presented a search that vector - like top quark mass below 557gev is excluded at 95% confidence level@xcite .",
    "considering these constraints to the relevant lrth parameters , we take @xmath65gev and make the @xmath64 and @xmath33 satisfy eq . ( 5 ) at all times .     as functions of the center - of - mass energy @xmath1 ( a ) and the scale @xmath33(b).,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]   as functions of the center - of - mass energy @xmath1 ( a ) and the scale @xmath33(b).,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    in fig.2(a )",
    ", we discuss the dependance of the production cross section @xmath66 on the center - of - mass energy @xmath1 for @xmath67gev .",
    "we can see that the cross section @xmath66 becomes lager with the @xmath1 increasing .    in fig.2(b ) , we discuss the dependance of the production cross section @xmath66 on the scale @xmath33 for @xmath68 , respectively .",
    "we can see the @xmath66 decreases as the scale @xmath33 increases , which means that the vector - like top quark production cross section decouples with the scale @xmath33 increasing .",
    "the maximum of the production cross section can reach 0.17fb for @xmath69gev and 0.25fb for @xmath70gev , respectively .",
    "if we take the integrated luminosity @xmath71 , there will be 125 events produced each year with @xmath1=@xmath2tev .    in fig.3 , we display the normalized transverse momentum distribution , the normalized distribution for the missing energy and the normalized rapidity of bottom quark of the process @xmath72 in the sm and the process @xmath44 in the lrth model .",
    "gev.,title=\"fig:\",width=177 ] gev.,title=\"fig:\",width=181 ] gev.,title=\"fig:\",width=181 ]    in fig.3(a ) , we show the normalized transverse momentum distribution behaviour of the sm top quark and the heavy top quark . as the neutrino comes from the initial state positron after emitting a @xmath5 boson , the heavy top quark transverse momentum peaks at @xmath73 , which is very similar to the transverse momentum distribution behaviour of the sm top quark .    in fig.3(b )",
    ", we show the normalized distribution for the missing energy @xmath4 carried by the final - state neutrino . compared with the sm top quark , the peak of the normalized distribution moves to the low energy region . with the scale @xmath33 increasing , this peak of the normalized distribution moves to the left .",
    "if we take a relevant missing energy @xmath4 cut , such as @xmath74gev for @xmath67gev , the sm background can be suppressed effectively .",
    "considering the subsequent decay of the heavy top quark , the main signal is 4 b jets + one charged lepton ( e or @xmath75 ) + energy @xmath4 .",
    "because the additional b jet carries off energy , the peak of the missing energy @xmath4 in the lrth model is lower than the peak in the sm .    in fig.3(c )",
    ", we show the normalized rapidity distribution of bottom quark . the @xmath76 diagram ( fig.1(a))corresponds to a virtual @xmath5 boson moving in the positive rapidity region to balance the @xmath77 emitted from the incoming @xmath78 .",
    "this virtual @xmath5 boson s decay products , the @xmath79 and @xmath80 quarks , lead to the small kink in the right region .",
    "by contrast , the same thing happens in the process @xmath0 , but the difference is that the kink is smaller due to the large mass of the heavy top quark .",
    "in this paper , we studied the single vector - like top production process @xmath0 in the lrth model .",
    "the result shows that there will be 125 events produced each year with @xmath1=@xmath2tev and the integrated luminosity @xmath3 at small value of the scale @xmath33 around 650 gev .",
    "now , by the b - quark tagging efficiency of @xmath81@xcite and the relevant missing energy @xmath4 cut , this new effects will help to test the lrth model and probe the new physics at the ilc .",
