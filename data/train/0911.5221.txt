    "an open question in solar and heliospheric physics is to identify the physical processes responsible for heating the corona and accelerating the fast solar wind streams emanating from coronal holes .",
    "this requires that a fraction of the energy available in photospheric motions be transported through the chromospheric transition region , and dissipated in the corona .",
    "the measured speeds of fast solar wind streams require spatially extended heating @xcite .",
    "the physical mechanisms for this transport and dissipation have remained elusive .",
    "some models have resorted to use of a parametrically defined heat deposition ( a `` heat function '' ) that decays exponentially with height , or anomalous heat conduction that redistributes energy along field - lines @xcite .",
    "one - dimensional ( 1d ) models of this kind , extending from the chromosphere to 1au @xcite , have helped in understanding the regulation of the solar wind mass flux and can reproduce fast solar wind streams originating in cool electron coronal holes .    here",
    "we present a model that demonstrates solar wind acceleration due to heating by a quasi - incompressible turbulent cascade triggered by coronal stratification @xcite , and supplemented by compressive heating near the base .",
    "this model accounts for most presently available coronal and interplanetary observations .",
    "the idea that broadband plasma fluctuations might heat the extended corona and accelerate the solar wind has long been discussed @xcite . however , the mechanisms of transfer of fluctuation energy to small scales  and , in particular , the role of alfvnic turbulence ( as observed in the solar wind ) and cascade processes ( e.g. , phase mixing , ponderomotive driving , shocks , etc.)have not been described self - consistently .",
    "two recent papers shed light on these relationships @xcite .",
    "@xcite incorporate 1d compressive nonlinear interactions driven by alfvn waves and leading to shock heating .",
    "this model produces good agreement with solar wind speed profiles . as low - frequency alfvn waves propagate upward , their wave pressure compresses the plasma .",
    "unable to refract or mode - mode couple into a perpendicular wavenumber cascade , these waves must dissipate in 1d shock fronts .",
    "this model provides a valuable demonstration that mhd fluctuations can act as a conduit to transport energy to the requisite altitudes .",
    "however the restriction to 1d cascade is at odds with the well - established propensity for an incompressible mhd cascade to proceed mainly through wavevectors perpendicular to a strong mean magnetic field @xcite .",
    "furthermore the corona exhibits a clear transverse structuring , and the initial fluctuations must have perpendicular correlation lengths not much larger than a super - granulation scale ( @xmath0 km ) .    another recent model @xcite incorporates a low - frequency cascade model @xcite ; however , the treatment of propagation and dissipation differs significantly from the present approach .",
    "their scheme treats nonlinear effects as a perturbation , and it is unclear if it converges for strong turbulent heating . here",
    "we employ a strong turbulence closure .",
    "we also do not rely on electron heat conduction to boost radial energy transport .",
    "instead we compute an internal energy associated with the protons only .",
    "this approach supports comparisons with results employing improved representation of turbulence , such as shell models @xcite and ( potentially ) full mhd simulation .",
    "we find here that reflection of alfvnic turbulence alone does not lead to a full corona / solar wind stationary state  a compressible contribution is required .",
    "this is supported by recent observations from _ hinode _ @xcite .",

    "for example , for a steep spectrum of low - frequency waves ( @xmath82 , slope  @xmath83 ) , use of only zero - frequency fluctuations is a very good approximation .",
    "for flatter spectra , the high - frequency part of the spectrum remains principally outward propagating [ @xmath84 , thus limiting the total turbulent dissipation .",

    "the position of the sonic critical point depends upon momentum and heat addition @xcite .",
    "given that we specify @xmath89 and @xmath90 , the mass flux is determined by @xmath91 , which is found by requiring that the solution becomes supersonic on passing through @xmath81 .",
    "it follows that deposition of heat before @xmath81 increases @xmath92 and typically @xmath91 , and thus also the mass flux .",
    "deposition of heat beyond @xmath81 does not alter @xmath92 , and so the mass flux is unchanged ; however @xmath47 increases and @xmath87 decreases beyond @xmath81 , with respect to a reference solution . generally speaking",
    ", the maximum of @xmath85 is below @xmath93 ( it coincides with @xmath93 in the undamped case ) , the turbulent heating peaks near @xmath81 , and the momentum added by the wave pressure has a maximum inside @xmath81 .",
    "two ways of controlling the heat and momentum deposition [ i.e. , adjusting the importance of nonlinear terms relative to reflection / wkb ( linear ) terms in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : genome ] ) ] , are through variations of @xmath94 and @xmath95 . decreasing the basal fluctuation amplitude ( @xmath96 , in fig .  [ fig:1 ] ) decreases the turbulent heating and acceleration .",
    "in addition heat deposition peaks well below @xmath81 ( fig .  [ fig:2]b ) , yielding a slow , overdense , cool wind , with a deficit of turbulent energy .",
    "it is clear that @xmath41 shapes the solution only below @xmath97 while differences arise from a different shape of @xmath78 .",
    "the asymptotic @xmath85 and @xmath77 do not vary much since beyond @xmath93 reflection is negligible and the ratio @xmath98 is then controlled by turbulent dissipation and @xmath95 .",
    "modification of @xmath95 leaves unchanged the position of the critical points ; i.e , it only slightly alters the turbulent heating close to the coronal base , where reflection controls the ratio @xmath98 .",
    "a larger basal correlation scale ( @xmath99 in fig .  [ fig:1 ] ) affects the solution mainly _ beyond _ @xmath81 , yielding a hotter and faster wind , but with the density almost unchanged .",
    "the fluctuations have features similar to the undamped solutions , resulting in excess turbulent energy ( that peaks closer to @xmath93 ) and more inward propagating waves ( a smaller @xmath63 ) .",

    "( [ eq : r1])([eq : r2 ] ) ] . decreasing the maximum super - radial expansion , to @xmath101 , while keeping fixed its location at @xmath102 ( fig .",

    "first , it decreases the correlation scale for @xmath103 , causing a reduction of turbulent energy and heating .",
    "second , it increases the density scale height around @xmath104 , hence reducing reflection and the amount of turbulent dissipation there .",
    "the result is much smaller turbulent heating that peaks again at @xmath81 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2]b ) yielding a slower , cooler , and denser wind , even as close as @xmath81 , which retains good asymptotic @xmath64 and @xmath63 .    finally , let us examine the role of compressive heating , recalling that @xmath105 . if the compressive heating is increased to @xmath106 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , violet dashed ) , the temperature maximum moves closer to the coronal base , but the resulting wind is slower , denser , and cooler .",
    "an increased @xmath41 also alters the incompressible heating  the height - integrated heating is almost unchanged , but heat deposition occurs at lower @xmath2 due to increased reflection at @xmath107 ( fig .  [ fig:2]b , compare the smaller @xmath63 in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) . beyond the peak of @xmath108",
    "the fluctuation energy remains small , reducing the extended turbulent heating .    on the other hand",
    ", decreasing @xmath109 enhances the incompressible heating ; then @xmath108 has a minimum near the maximum of @xmath110 , just inside @xmath81 , and also peaks outside @xmath81 .",
    "this causes convergence problems . in early iterations ,",
    "heat deposition is mainly outside @xmath81 , yielding a very fast , underdense , and hot wind , with strong density gradient ( and hence reflection ) at @xmath111 .",
    "this leads to runaway iterations in which the sonic point moves to larger @xmath2 with a temperature minimum inside @xmath81 .",
    "when the temperature minimum becomes very low the sonic critical point is reached with @xmath112 .",
    "then steep gradients occur close to the coronal base , heat deposition occurs close to @xmath81 , and the solution again resembles the initial solution , producing the ensuing runaway . to obtain a solution , the key features of @xmath41 are that it is localized well below @xmath81 , and is at least @xmath113 of the total heating ( for other parameters at reasonable levels ) .",
    "we found that the results do not depend strongly on the form of the compressive heat function provided that this heating is localized and not too large ( exponential , gaussian , etc . all work ) .",
    "the above model shows that turbulence near the coronal base , originating through chromospheric transmission of fluctuations , can heat the plasma in an expanding coronal hole flux - tube and produce a fast solar wind that matches a number of observational constraints .",
    "the turbulence is mainly of the low - frequency alfvnic type .",
    "a small amount of compressive heating between the transition region and the sonic point appears to be needed to match the observations .",
    "this additional heating may be due to type ii spicules that supply broadband low - frequency vertical fluctuations at transition region heights , thus launching compressive mhd modes near the coronal base @xcite .",
    "most of the fluctuation energy is in low - frequency turbulence , and this sustains a strong anisotropic mhd cascade through reflections from local density gradients .",
    "this type of anisotropic cascade is favored in mhd turbulence in the presence of a strong dc magnetic field @xcite .",
    "heat conduction does not enter the present model at all , since it mainly affects electron internal energy , which evolves independently in this approximation .",
    "similar assumptions work well in understanding observations of solar wind turbulence @xcite . in these ways ,",
    "the present model differs from other recent models that incorporate turbulent heating @xcite .",
    "in particular we believe that this model demonstrates , possibly for the first time , that a model ( almost ) free of ad hoc heat functions , artificial equations of state , and ad hoc assumptions about heat conduction , can indeed heat the corona and accelerate the solar wind .",
    "we plan further study of the required small amount of compressible heating , attributed here to spicule - driven magnetosonic activity .",
    "another useful extension would be to include separate electron and proton internal energy budgets , which will enable additional observational constraints , and will permit study of the role of kinetic dissipation processes @xcite .",
