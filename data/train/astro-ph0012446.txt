    "high redshift quasars provide a powerful means for exploring early epochs .",
    "it is likely that they flag regions where galaxy formation is very active .",
    "their host galaxies are probably still forming and they may occur in the exceptional ` 5 @xmath8 ' peaks in the matter distribution of the early universe .",
    "in addition to being of intrinsic interest themselves , bright high redshift quasars are particularly valuable as probes of the intervening gas clouds and galaxies superimposed on their spectra in absorption .",
    "the galaxies that intercept their line - of - sight provide samples selected by gas cross - section , without regard to their surface brightness , luminosity , or star formation rate .",
    "though direct studies of high redshift galaxies are now possible , those selected by the absorption lines they produce in quasar spectra still provide the only means to study in detail their kinematic properties at high resolution .",
    "this information can be combined with the colour and morphological information obtained from imaging to provide a complete picture of individual galaxies at high redshift .    in 1996",
    "we published spectra for 28 quasars discovered in the first apm colour survey for high redshift quasars ( storrie - lombardi  1996 , hereafter apm1 ) .",
    "these were located at equatorial declinations .",
    "we have completed the second apm colour survey for bright , z @xmath1 4 quasars in the southern hemisphere ( mainly with @xmath9 ) , discovering 23 more high redshift quasars .",
    "we also include 8 previously unpublished quasars also found using this same technique that were not directly part of the las campanas follow - up campaign .",
    "three other lower redshift quasars ( z = 0.40  2.73 ) were also found serendipitously in the survey and we include their spectra for completeness .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in @xmath102",
    "we discuss the methodology of the quasar candidate selection , in @xmath103 we describe the observations and present the spectra , in @xmath104 we discuss some of the objects individually , and in @xmath105 we provide a summary discussion .",
    "the quasar candidates were generally selected of the basis of their exceptionally red colour ( irwin , mcmahon & hazard 1991 ) , although in a few cases the addition of an i passband enabled selection closer to the main stellar locus to be made .",
    "all of the quasars bar one , br j1603@xmath110721 , were found using , r and , occasionally , i passband uk schmidt plates . in all cases these plates came from the generic southern sky survey material taken by the uk schmidt telescope ( ukst ) and were either glass copies of ` a ' grade survey plates , or original survey or / r and i plates .",
    "the northern object was found as part of a test series of measurements of possii survey ( second epoch palomar sky survey ) glass copies matched to possii r survey film copies .",
    "all plate material was measured and analysed at the automated plate measuring ( apm ) facility in cambridge , uk , to produce image lists including classification , magnitude and colour information ( for further details see kibblewhite 1984 ; irwin , demers & kunkel 1990 ) . a large fraction of the ukst survey plates were measured over a 5 year period from 1989 .",
    "consequently , many of the final survey grade ukst plates were not available at scanning time and in several cases early ` b ' grade survey plates were used instead .    at an early stage in the programme we decided to restrict the candidate selection to those stellar objects lying well away from the main stellar locus and to relatively bright magnitudes .",
    "this was mainly to increase the efficiency of the spectrographic follow - up and also because the primary goal of the programme was to find a bright sample of quasars for further absorption line follow - up studies .",
    "in addition , the multi - epoch nature of the plate material precludes attaining completeness based solely on colour / magnitude information due to the intrinsic variability of quasars ( see for example hook  1994 and references therein ) .",
    "the effects of colour selection on sample completeness have been thoroughly investigated over the past few years ( eg . warren , hewett & osmer 1994 ; apm1 , kennefick  1995 and references therein ) .    the efficacy of the traditional two - colour selection for finding z @xmath1 4 quasars based on , r",
    ", i photometry is shown in fig . 1 of irwin , mcmahon & hazard ( 1991 ) .",
    "since most of the current sample of quasars were selected using what we have called the ` brx ' technique , we demonstrate this method in the current paper .",
    "[ f_cmd ] shows a , r colour - magnitude diagram for a typical high latitude ukst field .",
    "every detected , r matched pair of objects classified as stellar on the r plate is plotted as a small dot .",
    "overlaid as filled circles are the complete southern sample of brx - selected quasars .",
    "of the roughly 250,000 paired objects on each high latitude ukst field , two - thirds are classified as stellar on the r plate and roughly 50,000 of these are brighter than r @xmath12 19  19.5 , the range for the r magnitude limit .",
    "although the aim was to find bright r  19 magnitude quasars , rather than impose a rigid magnitude cut we allowed the faint limit to reach 19.5 if the plate pairs were of suitably good quality and had a clean colour - magnitude diagram at this limit .",
    "the red boundary for br candidate selection was set to approximately r @xmath12 2.5 for images brighter than r @xmath12 18.5 and was then increased roughly linearly to r @xmath12 3 at r @xmath12 19.5 .",
    "this results in a very clean sample , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ f_cmd ] , with usually at most 10 candidates per field .",
    "roughly half of the candidates can be easily rejected using the online apm catalogue finding charts .",
    "these rejected objects would typically be objects : close to the edge of the scanned area on one or other plate ; in , or near , the halo of bright stars ; affected by some scratch or satellite trail ; close to one of the density wedges ; and so on .    a schematic representation of the area of sky surveyed in the current work , together with those areas surveyed in our previously published sample ( apm1 ) ,",
    "is given in fig .",
    "[ f_qsostatus ] .",
    "the total area of southern high latitude sky surveyed is roughly 8000 square degrees from a total of 328 ukst fields .",
    "although the measured area of each field amounts to some 5.8 @xmath13 5.8 degrees , the effective area of each field is only @xmath325 square degrees .",
    "this is mainly due to the 5 degree grid spacing of the survey but also involves reductions because of the effect of density wedges and general edge effects .",
    "the majority of the fields used are high latitude in the sense that @xmath14 , however there are a small number of fields closer to the galactic plane than that , since the survey data was measured for a variety of projects .",
    "external deep photometric calibration did not ( and still does not ) exist for the majority of the fields surveyed .",
    "however , as in earlier work using the apm facility , we used an internal plate calibration method ( bunclark & irwin 1983 ) as the basis of a ( mainly ) internal calibration scheme . making use of the uniformity in depth of the schmidt survey plates and the fact that colour equations for ukst plate / filter combinations are well known ( eg .",
    "blair & gilmore 1982 ; irwin , demers & kunkel 1990 ) facilitates use of a natural photographic passband magnitude scale .",
    "although from external sequence checks the faint stellar r - band magnitude scale can only be tied down to an @xmath15 variation of 0.25 magnitudes with this method , the known properties of galactic foreground stars can be readily used to define the colour to an accuracy of 0.1 magnitude .",
    "this , and a reliable star  galaxy classifier , make candidate selection extremely straightforward .",
    "candidate follow - up proceeded over several years , using a range of facilities ( see table  [ t1 ] column 10 ) , with the majority of the follow - up taking place at las campanas during three spectroscopic runs in 1997 and 1998 .",
    "candidates were generally prioritised for observation on the extremity of their colour and on their relative brightness .",
    "although we have not observed more than @xmath350% of the total number of candidates , spectra have been obtained for all of the most promising objects . in several fields",
    "where early on during the survey we observed all the candidates , we found that objects near the stellar locus invariably turned out to be late m - stars shifted out of the main locus by the inevitable non - gaussian tale of the photometric errors . in subsequent",
    "observing runs we were more conservative in candidate selection in order to speed up the progress of the survey .    for the follow - up undertaken at the dupont 100-inch telescope at las",
    "campanas we used the modular spectrograph with the 300 l / mm grating and the tek#5 ccd , in gray and bright time .",
    "this gives wavelength coverage from approximately 40009000  ( 2.5  per pixel ) which easily covers the and civ emission lines and the forest drop for quasars with 4 @xmath0 z @xmath0 5 .",
    "typical exposure times were 600  900 seconds which allowed differentiation between high redshift quasars with a continuum drop across the line caused by intervening cosmological absorption , and m - dwarfs or galaxies at z @xmath4 0.3 , the main contaminants in the survey .",
    "the spectra were reduced as they were taken using standard iraf routines which allowed us to follow - up in real time any candidates where the first spectrum did not make it immediately clear whether it was a quasar or not . for every 810 candidates remaining from the selection in @xmath102 ,",
    "one is a high redshift quasar .",
    "the additional observations were also taken at low resolution on a variety of facilities during other observing runs between 1986 - 1997 , mainly at times when the primary observing programme could not be executed .    throughout the survey , apart from high redshift quasars , the",
    "only ` real ' objects we have found lying significantly redward of the k / m stellar locus are : misclassified compact galaxies , usually ellipticals at redshift 0.30.4 , where the 4000  break has left the  passband at 5400 ; very late - type m giants including miras and other long period variables ; distant halo carbon stars ( eg . totten & irwin 1998 ) ; very late type - often high proper motion - nearby dwarf m stars ( irwin , mcmahon & reid 1991 ; kirkpatrick , todd & irwin 1997 ) and at least one field brown dwarf ( tinney 1998 ) ; and the occasional cv and/or pn .",
    "the quasars discovered are listed in table  [ t1 ] .",
    "the quasars were originally selected off photographic plates using b1950 coordinates as the default equinox , but we have listed their names with the j2000 coordinate system as well for ease of cross - reference .",

    "the histograms highlight several important characteristics of the br(i ) survey :    a. ) there is a well defined upper redshift limit to which the survey is sensitive .",
    "this upper limit is primarily caused by the r - band emulsion cutoff at 6900  and represents the point where the redshifted line moves out of the r - band .",
    "consequently the entire r - band flux lies within the forest and the intrinsic strong ` continuum drop ' across causes the r - band magnitude selection boundary to move to even brighter absolute magnitudes on the quasar luminosity function , with a corresponding dramatic fall in the expected number of quasars .",
    "the other compounding factor at z @xmath1 5 is the statistical proximity of lyman limit systems to the redshift of the quasar ( eg . storrie - lombardi  1994 ) .",
    "this means that even bright quasars are not detected on the plates , which have a limit of roughly @xmath20 .",
    "b. ) the roll - over in numbers at redshift z @xmath12 4.2 is mainly caused by the candidate selection for the majority of the fields making use of the brx selection technique .",
    "although , we are dealing with small number statistics , it is clear that the bri technique can be used to somewhat lower redshifts , z @xmath12 4.0 , in general .",
    "this is simply because the extra leverage obtained from the i - band enables candidates to be selected closer to the stellar locus .",
    "for example , it is clear from comparing fig . 1 . of irwin , mcmahon , & hazard , ( 1991 ) , with figure 1",
    "in the current paper , that brx - selected candidates are a subset of bri - selected objects .",
    "c. ) in general the bal quasars appear to be at redshifts significantly lower than `` normal '' quasars .",
    "this is also a selection bias due to the fact that in addition to the usual strong absorption troughs blueward of the standard quasar emission lines , bal quasars have strong lyman limit systems at the redshift of the quasar .",
    "this depresses the band flux more than for normal quasars enabling them to be selected just below redshift z @xmath12 4 and also causes the flux to be depressed to such a low level that they no longer register on the plates at redshifts much beyond z @xmath12 4.3 .",
