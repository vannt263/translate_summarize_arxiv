    "the modeling of epidemic spreading is a fascinating subject both in theoretical biology and statistical physics far from equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "a possible approach is the study of stochastic models that mimic the competition of infectious spreading and recovery by certain probabilistic rules .",
    "depending on the rates for infection and recovery the disease may either spread over the population or disappear after some time .    the simplest models for epidemic spreading assume that the individuals live on the sites of a @xmath0-dimensional lattice .",
    "at a given time each individual can be either infected or healthy .",
    "the system evolves according to certain probabilistic rules that resemble infection of nearest neighbors and spontaneous recovery .",
    "if the susceptibility to infections is sufficiently large the epidemic will spread while for low susceptibilities it will die out .",
    "in most models it is assumed that the contagious disease is transmitted exclusively by direct contact .",
    "this means that the disease , once extinct , can not appear again .",
    "the system is then trapped in a fully recovered state , which can be reached but not be left .",
    "such a state , where the system is dynamically trapped , is called _ absorbing_. the two regimes of spreading and extinction are usually separated by a so - called absorbing phase transition . in the supercritical regime , where infections dominate , the epidemic may spread over the entire system , reaching a fluctuating stationary state with a certain average density of infected individuals . in the subcritical regime , where recovery dominates",
    ", the system eventually reaches the fully recovered absorbing state .",
    "close to the transition the temporal evolution of the spreading process is characterized by large - scale fluctuations .",
    "theoretical interest in epidemic spreading stems from the fact that this type of critical behavior is universal , i.e. , it does not depend on the details of the model under consideration .",
    "the classification of all possible transitions from fluctuating phases into absorbing states is currently one of the major goals of nonequilibrium statistical physics  @xcite .    in epidemic models without immunization , where the pathogen ( e.g.  a virus ) is transmitted to nearest neighbors ,",
    "the critical behavior at the transition generically belongs to the universality class of directed percolation ( dp )  @xcite .",
    "the dp class is very robust and plays an important role not only in epidemiology but also in various other fields such as reggeon field theory  @xcite , interface depinning  @xcite , population growth  @xcite , catalytic reactions  @xcite , and flowing sand  @xcite ( for a review of possible experimental applications see  @xcite ) .    as a next step towards a more realistic description of epidemic spreading one",
    "can take the effect of immunization or weakening by infections into account  @xcite .",
    "the simplest way of implementing immunization is to change the initial susceptibility of an individual after the first infection and keep it constant thereafter .",
    "generally such a process is controlled by two parameters , namely , a probability for first infections and a reinfection probability . in the case of perfect immunization , where each individual can be infected only once , one obtains the so - called ` general epidemic process ' ( gep )  @xcite .",
    "it differs from dp in so far as the disease can only spread in those parts of the system which have not been infected before .",
    "thus , starting with a single infected site in a non - immune environment , the disease typically propagates in form of a solitary wave , leaving a region of immune sites behind . depending on the infection rate",
    "this wave may either spread over the entire system or stop before .",
    "the transition between infinite and finite spreading is a critical phenomenon which in this case belongs to the universality class of dynamical isotropic percolation  @xcite .",
    "note that unlike dp models , a gep running on a _ finite _ system has no fluctuating active state , instead the process terminates when it reaches the boundaries .    in nature , however , immunization is a much more complex phenomenon .",
    "for example , the protection by immunization may abate as time proceeds .",
    "even more importantly , the strategy of immunization competes with the ability of the contagious pathogen to mutate so that it can no longer be recognized by the immune system of previously infected individuals , weakening the effect of immunization .",
    "the aim of the present work is to introduce and study a simple model which mimics epidemic spreading with immunization and mutation . to this end",
    "we generalize the model described in  @xcite by including mutations as well as a mechanism for the competition between different species of pathogens .",
    "the model is controlled by three parameters , namely , a first infection probability , a reinfection probability controlling the effect of immunization , and a probability for spontaneous mutations . moreover ,",
    "the model is defined in such a way that it includes dp and gep as special cases .",
    "the article is structured as follows . in sec .",

    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "our model is meant to describe the spreading of an infectious disease that evolves as follows .",
    "individuals can be healthy or infected with a certain pathogen . during their illness infected individuals may infect or reinfect neighboring individuals with certain probabilities . moreover , there is a probability that a pathogen mutates during transmission . because of the enormous number of possible mutations one usually obtains an entirely new type of pathogen which has not been involved before . to simplify the model we also assume that each individual can be infected at a given time by no more than a _",
    "single _ type of pathogen . if the individual is exposed simultaneously to several competing pathogens , one of them is randomly selected .    in more technical terms",
    "the model is defined as follows .",
    "individuals live on the sites of a @xmath0-dimensional simple cubic lattice",
    ". each site may be either healthy ( inactive ) or infected ( active ) by a pathogen of type @xmath1 , where @xmath1 is a positive integer .",
    "moreover , each site keeps track of all species of pathogens by which it has been infected in the past .",
    "therefore , the state of a site is characterized by a number @xmath1 together with a dynamically generated list of all previous types of infections .",
    "the model evolves in time by synchronous updates , i.e. , in each time step the whole lattice is updated in parallel as follows :    1 .   * spreading : * each infected individual at time @xmath2 transmits its pathogen @xmath1 to its @xmath3 nearest neighbors ( target sites ) at time @xmath4 .",
    "* susceptibility : * the transmitted pathogen reaches the target site at time @xmath4 with probability @xmath5 if this site has never been infected before by this species , otherwise it reaches the target site with probability  @xmath6 .",
    "* competition : * if a target site is exposed to several transmitted pathogens , one of them is randomly selected with equal weight .",
    "mutation and infection : * before infecting the target site the selected pathogen mutates with probability @xmath7 , replacing @xmath1 by a new integer number ( drawn from a global counter ) which has not been used before .",
    "* immunization : * in case of a first infection the type of pathogen is added to the list of species against which the site will be immune in the future .",
    "* recovery : * all sites that have been active at time @xmath2 recover until time @xmath4 unless they are not again infected during the update from @xmath2 to @xmath4 .",
    "hence the time of illness is a single time step .",
    "in what follows we restrict our analysis to the special case of perfect immunization @xmath8 . in this case the model is controlled by only two parameters , namely , the probability of first infections @xmath5 and the probability of mutations  @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , we restrict ourselves to the case of @xmath9 spatial dimensions . the corresponding phase diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ figphasediagram ] .",
    "it comprises an active phase , where the epidemic spreads , and an inactive phase , where the disease dies out so that the system eventually enters the fully recovered absorbing state .",
    "both phases are separated by a curved phase transition line .",
    "we first note that the endpoints of the phase transition line correspond to well - known special cases . on the one hand , for @xmath10",
    "the model reduces to the gep on a square lattice  @xcite , provided that only one type of pathogen is involved . in this case the critical value of @xmath5 is exactly given by @xmath11  @xcite . on the other hand , for @xmath12 all transmitted pathogens mutate , i.e. , the target sites are always infected with a new species so that immunization has no influence .",

    "[ figphasediagram ] clearly shows that introducing mutations in a gep has a strong influence on @xmath14 , especially if @xmath7 is very small . since the phase transition line approaches the gep point with infinite slope ( see inset in fig .",
    "[ figphasediagram ] ) a tiny increase of @xmath7 reduces the corresponding critical value of @xmath5 dramatically .",
    "this indicates that mutations are a relevant perturbation and thus the spreading behavior of the model for @xmath15 is expected to differ from that of the gep . on the other hand , for larger values @xmath16",

    "if a site is immune solely against pathogens that already became extinct the gray dot is removed .",

    "although there still is a region of immune individuals it does no longer provide efficient protection against infections since it is reinvaded by mutated pathogens . * increasing @xmath7 further the process changes its appearance already at an early stage .",
    "there are only small patches of immune sites and the process reminds more of dp than gep .",
    "* finally for @xmath12 every transmitted pathogen mutates into a new one . in this case immunization",
    "has no influence and the process reduces to dp .",
    "since the disease is not driven away from immunized regions the spatial extension of an epidemic at the phase transition grows much slower compared to a critical gep .",
    "based on these phenomenological observations we expect the model to behave initially in the same way as a gep . after a certain time mutations become relevant , allowing former immune areas to be reinvaded . especially close to the transition the process survives long enough to reach this crossover time .",
    "the visual appearance of the process is then increasingly similar to that of a dp process .",
    "the time it takes to observe the crossover from gep to dp grows with decreasing @xmath7 and eventually diverges in the limit @xmath27 .",
    "phase transitions into absorbing states are usually characterized by simple scaling laws . in models for epidemic spreading an important quantity",
    "is the probability @xmath28 that an epidemic starting from a single infected seed in a healthy and non - immune environment survives at least until time  @xmath2 .",
    "let us first recall the standard scaling laws for the survival probability . let @xmath29 denote the distance from criticality . if @xmath30 the survival probability first decays as a power law @xmath31 until a certain timescale @xmath32 is reached from where on it either saturates at @xmath33 for @xmath34 or decays exponentially for @xmath35 , reaching a spatial extension @xmath36 .",
    "assuming scaling invariance this behavior can be described in terms of a scaling form @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a scaling function with the asymptotic behavior @xmath39 such that the time dependence drops out for @xmath40 .",
    "the scaling function @xmath38 and the triplet of critical exponents @xmath41 are believed to characterize the universality class of the phase transition under consideration .",
    "we note that this scaling form is known to be valid both for gep and dp , although with different sets of critical exponents  @xcite @xmath42 for the density @xmath43 in dp a similar scaling form as in eq .",

    "( [ exponents ] ) for @xmath9 ) .",
    "we now analyze the critical behavior of the model , assuming that the scaling form  ( [ scaling ] ) is valid everywhere in the vicinity of the phase transition line . although the qualitative discussion in sec .",
    "[ intro ] suggests dp behavior for @xmath44 we note that this would be a non - trivial result since the so - called dp - conjecture does not apply in the present case .",
    "the dp - conjecture  @xcite states that phase transitions in two - state systems with a reachable absorbing state and short - range interactions belong to dp , provided that memory effects , non - conventional symmetries , and quenched disorder are absent .",

    "the scaling form  ( [ scaling ] ) implies that these quantities vary at criticality algebraically as @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 for gep and @xmath50 for dp  @xcite .",
    "[ critseedpic ] shows our results of seed - simulations along the phase transition line .",
    "we note that these simulations are numerically challenging since for each site a list of infections in the past has to be created and continuously updated .",
    "therefore , numerical simulations are mainly limited by the available memory and restricted the present study to a maximal temporal range of about @xmath51 monte carlo updates .    in order to determine the critical threshold @xmath52 we kept @xmath7 fixed and varied @xmath5 until @xmath28 displayed the expected slope of dp in a log - log plot ( dashed lines in fig .",
