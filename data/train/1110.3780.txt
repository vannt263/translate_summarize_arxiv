    "many physical problems in periodic media with the kerr ( cubic ) nonlinearity are governed by the gross  pitaevskii equation with a periodic potential .",
    "examples are bose  einstein condensates in optical lattices @xcite and photonic - crystal fibers @xcite .",
    "interest in properties of localized states in this model has stimulated a number of mathematical works devoted to this subject @xcite .",
    "an interesting problem that arises in this context is the possibility of bifurcations of stationary localized states from edges of bloch bands in the wave spectrum of the schrdinger operator with a periodic potential .",
    "first pioneering works in this direction were completed by c. stuart and his students @xcite . in the physics literature",
    "the asymptotic approximations of gap solitons bifurcating from band edges were developed by various authors in one dimension @xcite and two dimensions @xcite .",
    "in one dimension it was discovered numerically in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 6.2 ) and explained analytically in @xcite that while single - pulse gap solitons bifurcate continuously from band edges , double - pulse gap solitons do not bifurcate from the band edges but experience fold bifurcations at a small distance from the edges .",
    "the situation becomes even more interesting in the space of two dimensions , where besides gap solitons , vortex solutions are possible in periodic potentials @xcite .",
    "however , a contradiction arises between the analytical results of @xcite suggesting a continuous family of the fundamental vortex solutions bifurcating from the band edges and the numerical results of @xcite ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 6.5 ) ) suggesting a fold bifurcation of vortex families at a small distance from the band edges .",
    "this contradiction will be inspected in this paper by using numerical computations .",
    "we will show that there do exist continuous families of the fundamental vortex solutions bifurcating from band edges , according to the theory in @xcite .",
    "numerical approximations of these families near band edges suffer , however , from the fact that the vortex localization is too broad and hence extends beyond the chosen computational domain . as a result , a spurious fold bifurcation occurs for the fundamental vortex family before the family reaches the band edge . if the size of the computational domain is enlarged , the location of the spurious fold bifurcation moves closer to the band edge . at the same time",
    "there are other vortex families , found also in @xcite , which feature a true fold bifurcation at a small distance from a band edge .",
    "the fold location is independent of the size of the computational domain for these vortex families .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ models ] introduces the two models which we inspect , namely the gross  pitaevskii equation with a periodic potential and the discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation .",
    "the connection between these models as well as the asymptotics of gap solitons near the band edges are reviewed .",

    "pitaevskii equation @xcite . in the simplest case",
    "when @xmath7 is attained by only one extremum of the band structure and the hessian at the extremum is definite , the resulting approximation is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is arbitrary , @xmath11 is the bloch function at the band edge @xmath7 , and @xmath12 in slow variables @xmath13 and @xmath14 satisfies the stationary nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation .",
    "this effective nls equation is written in the form , [ e : nls ] ( _ xx + _ yy ) +    at the point @xmath7 and @xmath15 is related to a norm of the bloch function @xmath11 .",
    "we note that the leading - order term @xmath16 has the order @xmath17 as @xmath18 and hence expansion ( [ expansion ] ) shows that the perturbation term is smaller than the leading - order term in the @xmath19 norm , where @xmath19 is sobolev space of square integrable functions and their derivatives up to the @xmath20-th order . when @xmath7 is the ( upper ) edge of the semiinfinite gap , the error was shown to be @xmath21 or @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the main theorem of @xcite states that if @xmath23 satisfies certain reversibility symmetries such as @xmath24 or @xmath25 and if the linearization of the stationary nls equation ( [ e : nls ] ) is non - degenerate , then a localized solution of the gross  pitaevskii equation ( [ e : pnls ] ) with the asymptotic expansion ( [ expansion ] ) exists in @xmath19 for this @xmath23 . in particular , the stationary nls equation ( [ e : nls ] ) admits the fundamental vortex of charge @xmath26 , @xmath27 where @xmath28 for all @xmath29 satisfies a certain differential equation that follows from the stationary nls equation ( [ e : nls ] )",

    "several authors @xcite rigorously justified that the localized states of the stationary gross ",

    "we compute here a family of the fundamental vortices in the dnls equation ( [ e : dnls ] ) by using the near - edge asymptotics with @xmath23 given by the continuous vortex ( [ e : nls_vort ] )",
    ". we will also compare this behavior with the one in the gross  pitaevskii equation ( [ e : pnls ] ) .    choosing the vortex of charge one in the form ( [ e : nls_vort ] ) with @xmath33 , we compute the positive spatial profile @xmath34 by the shooting method .",
