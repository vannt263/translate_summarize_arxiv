    "the formalism of supersymmetry ( susy ) has become popular in quantum mechanics as a method to construct new solvable models .",
    "the principal scheme of susy goes back to the darboux transformation that was first introduced in @xcite as an algorithm to map solutions of linear differential equations onto each other . as such",
    ", it applies to quantum - mechanical systems governed by equations of schrdinger type .",
    "while the concept of darboux transformations has been developed further and became applicable to a variety of linear and nonlinear equations @xcite @xcite , it has been most successfully used within the susy framework in quantum - mechanical applications that involve spectral problems , see e.g. the reviews @xcite @xcite and references therein .",
    "the reason for this lies in the fact that besides generating new systems admitting closed - form solutions , the susy scheme can be used for the modification of associated spectra .",
    "in particular , discrete spectral values corresponding to bound state solutions of a quantum system , can be created or removed .",
    "there is a large amount of literature dedicated to the study of such spectral problems , newer examples include applications to particular systems , involving parametric double - well potentials @xcite , confined harmonic oscillator intercations @xcite , or the swanson model @xcite .",
    "more examples of such applications can be found from the references in @xcite .",
    "another , related branch of research that involves the susy scheme concerns the construction of rational extensions to solvable potentials , such that the extended system admits solutions in terms of exceptional orthogonal polynomials @xcite @xcite , see for example the recent studies @xcite @xcite @xcite",
    ". roughly speaking , one can distinguish two different types of susy algorithms that apply to models governed by the schrdinger equation : the standard algorithm that is used in the vast majority of applications , and the less known confluent algorithm .",
    "the difference between them manifests in the so - called auxiliary or seed solutions that are necessary to apply the respective algorithm . in the standard case ,",
    "the latter functions are required to be solutions to the initial schrdinger equation , while in the confluent case they must solve an inhomogeneous system of equations , often referred to as a jordan chain .",
    "there is considerably less literature on the confluent susy scheme than on its standard counterpart .",
    "an introduction , discussion of mathematical properties and some applications can be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite-@xcite , as well as in @xcite and @xcite . despite the latter references ,",
    "properties of the confluent susy algorithm remain unknown , for example the link between the auxiliary solutions and regularity of the transformed potential in the general case .",
    "furthermore , generalizations of the standard susy scheme to models not governed by schrdinger equations , do not include the confluent case .",
    "an example for such a scenario is the dirac equation .",
    "the susy algorithm was introduced @xcite and applied @xcite , but only for the standard context .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to complement the latter results by setting up the confluent susy scheme for the dirac equation , applicable to systems governed by pseudoscalar potentials . for applications of such potentials",
    ", the reader may refer to @xcite @xcite and references therein .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 gives a brief review of the confluent susy formalism for the schrdinger equation , while section 3 is devoted to the construction of the confluent algorithm for the dirac equation .",
    "a discussion regarding spectral problems and regular transformed potentials can be found in section 4 .",
    "the final section 5 presents several examples , demonstrating the generation of solutions to spectral problems as well as the manipulation of the corresponding spectra .",
    "we start out by considering the following stationary schrdinger equation in atomic units @xmath1 where the energy @xmath2 is a real - valued constant and @xmath3 denotes the potential . in order to apply a @xmath4-th order confluent susy transformation ( or @xmath4-susy transformation ) to a solution @xmath5 of ( [ schro ] )",
    ", we must first determine @xmath6 functions @xmath7 , that solve the following system of equations , @xmath8 introducing a real constant @xmath9 . the system ( [ j1 ] ) , ( [ j2 ] )",
    "is commonly referred to as jordan chain of order @xmath4 , while the functions @xmath10 , @xmath11 are often called auxiliary solutions or transformation functions . in the conventional susy scheme",
    ", the auxiliary solutions must satisfy the initial schrdinger equation at pairwise different energies @xcite , which precisely constitutes the difference to the confluent algorithm that we are focusing on : here , all auxiliary solutions are associated with the same energy value @xmath9 .",
    "now , once the system ( [ j1 ] ) , ( [ j2 ] ) has been solved , we can construct the following function @xmath12 : @xmath13 where the symbol @xmath14 stands for the wronskian of the auxiliary solutions in its index .",
    "the function @xmath12 is a solution to the schrdinger equation @xmath15 for the transformed potential @xmath16 , given by the expression @xmath17 here , @xmath18 stands for an arbitrary constant .",
    "while the expressions for the transformed solution ( [ phi ] ) and its associated potential ( [ pottrans ] ) look formally the same as in the conventional susy scheme @xcite , they are profoundly different due to the system ( [ j1 ] ) , ( [ j2 ] ) that determines the auxiliary solutions in the confluent case . by means of the variation - of - constants formula , the following integral representation of the auxiliary solutions can be constructed @xcite : @xmath19 where @xmath20 stands for any solution of the first equation ( [ j1 ] ) . an alternative representation for the second - order case @xmath21 in ( [ j1 ] ) , ( [ j2 ] )",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath20 stands for any solution of ( [ j1 ] ) and we understand @xmath23 as a function depending on both the variable @xmath24 , as well as the parameter @xmath9 that enters through equation ( [ j1 ] ) and it is a sufficiently smooth function of both arguments .",
    "it is important to point out that the particular solutions , given by the second terms on the right hand sides of ( [ integral ] ) for @xmath21 and ( [ u1rep2 ] ) , respectively , in general are not the same .",
    "the second representation ( [ u1rep2 ] ) is very convenient if the integrals in ( [ integral ] ) can not be carried out , as will be demonstrated in the application section 5.2 .",
    "in this work we focus on the following stationary , two - component dirac equation in one spatial dimension @xcite @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 stands for the second pauli matrix , @xmath2 denotes a real - valued number , and the spinor @xmath27 represents the solution .",
    "furthermore , we assume the potential @xmath28 to be of pseudoscalar form , that is , @xmath29 for a constant , positive mass @xmath30 , pauli matrices @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and a function @xmath33 . in components ,",
    "the dirac equation ( [ dirac ] ) for the potential ( [ pseudo ] ) can be written as @xmath34 solving the first of these equations for @xmath35 gives the relation @xmath36 substitution of this expression into ( [ d2 ] ) leads to the equation @xmath37 hence , any spinor that solves the initial dirac equation ( [ dirac ] ) , is also a solution to the equations ( [ 2nd ] ) , ( [ schr ] ) and vice versa .",
    "let us now rewrite ( [ schr ] ) as follows @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "equation ( [ sse ] ) is of schrdinger form and as such admits the susy formalism .",
    "while the conventional susy scheme has already been discussed and applied , we will now focus on the confluent case and make it available to the dirac equation . to this end , assume that we have found @xmath6 solutions @xmath41 of the jordan chain ( [ j1 ] ) , ( [ j2 ] ) .",
    "then the function @xmath42 , given by ( [ phi ] ) is a solution of the schrdinger equation @xmath43 the potential @xmath16 is given by the expression ( [ pottrans ] ) , that is , @xmath44 for an arbitrary constant @xmath18 .",
    "now , in order to convert the transformed schrdinger potential ( [ u1 ] ) to a pseudoscalar dirac potential , we must identify a function @xmath45 that is the counterpart of @xmath33 in ( [ pseudo ] ) .",
    "such a function @xmath45 can be obtained once the transformed schrdinger equation ( [ sset ] ) is rewritten in the form @xmath46 comparison of the two equations ( [ sset ] ) and ( [ sset1 ] ) leads to the following condition for the sought function @xmath45 : @xmath47 where @xmath16 is given in ( [ u1 ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ ric ] ) is of riccati type , the general solution of which can only be obtained from a known particular solution that will be determined now .",
    "first , we apply the linearizing transformation @xmath48 to ( [ ric ] ) , leading to the result @xmath49 after comparison with equation ( [ sset ] ) we conclude that a particular solution of ( [ riclin ] ) is provided by a solution @xmath42 of ( [ sset ] ) , evaluated at the energy @xmath50 , that is , @xmath51 as a direct consequence we obtain a particular solution @xmath52 of the riccati equation ( [ ric ] ) as @xmath53 it is well - known that the general solution of our riccati equation can be constructed by means of a particular solution @xmath52 via the formula @xmath54 where @xmath55 denotes an arbitrary constant . since we know that our particular solution is given in the form ( [ q1p ] ) , we can incorporate the latter function into ( [ q1pp ] ) , leading to the simplified version @xmath56 + \\left ( c~\\hat{q}^2 + \\hat{q}^2 \\int\\limits^x \\frac{1}{\\hat{q}^2}~dt \\right)^{-1}. \\label{q1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the constant @xmath55 is arbitrary , expression ( [ q1 ] ) provides a one - parameter family of functions that result from the confluent susy transformation . in the last step it remains to convert ( [ q1 ] ) into a transformed pseudoscalar dirac potential @xmath57 , given by @xmath58 the explicit form of this potential",
    "is obtained after insertion of ( [ q1 ] ) .",

    "the one - parameter family of pseudoscalar potentials ( [ v1 ] ) enters in the transformed dirac equation as follows @xmath61 the first component @xmath42 of the solution spinor @xmath62 to our equation ( [ diract ] ) is given in ( [ phi ] ) , while the second component @xmath63 is determined through a relation analogous to ( [ 2nd ] ) : @xmath64 where the explicit form of @xmath45 can be found in ( [ q1 ] ) . due to the length of the expressions involved here ,",
    "we omit to show the expanded form of @xmath63 .",
    "while in the previous section we introduced the confluent susy algorithm as an entirely computational scheme for the dirac equation , we will now focus on spectral problems , as they appear in quantum mechanics . in particular , we are interested in finding constraints , under which the transformed potential is free of singularities and the associated transformed solution is @xmath65-normalizable .",
    "before we go into more detail , let us assume the dirac equation ( [ dirac ] ) to be defined on a real interval @xmath66 , equipped with boundary conditions of dirichlet type at the endpoints of @xmath67 , that is , @xmath68 , which are allowed to be understood in the sense of a limit , and the norm of a spinor given by @xmath69 we further assume that this spectral problem admits a discrete spectrum @xmath70 of energies , where @xmath71 belongs to some index set , such that @xmath72 is uniformly bounded from below by its minimum @xmath73 ( ground state energy ) .",
    "the transformed problem , governed by equation ( [ diract ] ) for the boundary conditions @xmath74 , must have a nonsingular potential @xmath57 in order for the solutions to be physically meaningful .",
    "if we do not want singularities in the domain of @xmath57 , we have to take care of two issues : to obtain a regular schrdinger potential @xmath16 from the confluent susy transformation and to generate @xmath45 without additional singularities .    the condition imposed by the confluent algorithm @xcite to obtain a schrdinger potential @xmath16 without new singularities",
    "is that the wronskian @xmath75 in must be nodeless in @xmath76 . in other words ,",
    "the wronskian is allowed to vanish only at the points @xmath77 or @xmath78 .",
    "this condition has different characteristics for each order @xmath4 of the susy transformation .",
    "for example , in the second order case @xmath21 , the derivative of the wronskian @xmath79 can be expressed , using the jordan chain ( [ j1 ] ) , ( [ j2 ] ) , as @xmath80 which implies that for a real potential @xmath81 in , the wronskian is a non increasing monotone function and can be written as @xmath82 where @xmath83 is an integration constant . if we find a transformation function such that @xmath84 or @xmath85 , then it can be always found a domain for @xmath83 to avoid zeros in the wronskian . for the third order case @xmath86 in addition of the condition for the value in one of the boundaries of the domain @xmath67 it",
    "is also required that @xmath87 in , for more details of this case see @xcite .",
    "now , the regularity of the pseudoscalar dirac potential ( [ v1 ] ) also depends on the function @xmath45 , as given in ( [ q1p ] ) and ( [ q1 ] ) .",
    "let us consider the particular case ( [ q1p ] ) , our condition is to find a solution @xmath88 that is free of zeros in @xmath76 .",
    "it generates a nonsingular parametrizing function @xmath45 if we choose the latter function as the particular solution @xmath60 in ( [ q1p ] ) . in case",
    "we use the general solution ( [ q1 ] ) for @xmath45 , rather than ( [ q1p ] ) , we can avoid singularities in @xmath76 by additionally imposing that @xmath89 is bounded from above or below .",
    "this choice implies that there is a constant @xmath55 in ( [ q1 ] ) , such that the denominator in the second term does not vanish .    when the confluent susy algorithm is applied to the schrdinger equation",
    "some properties are conserved , in particular the spectral properties which reminds almost equal , the spectral manipulation that can be done are : to add an eigenvalue , to delete one or to obtain a new equation with the same spectrum .",
    "the position of this possible extra eigenvalue is in general arbitrary but every order @xmath4 of the transformation has its own peculiarities . to observe if one extra eigenvalue is inserted or suppressed in the spectrum of the transformed equation special attention have to be paid",
    "when @xmath90 .",
    "notice that @xmath23 is a solution of and the corresponding transformed solution is the trivial .",
    "a linear independent solution @xmath91 can be obtained asking @xmath92 @xcite , that is @xmath93 a direct substitution demonstrate that @xmath91 is solution of .",
    "now , if we transform this solution using the rule , then @xmath94 to obtain the last equality first the columns of the wronskian determinant were interchanged , @xmath95 then all the second and higher derivatives of the transformation functions were replaced by the transformation functions themselves and their first derivative using the jordan chain , . with elementary row operations",
    "an upper triangular block determinant can be obtained , @xmath96 and since by construction @xmath92 , the equation has been demonstrated .",
    "if the solution is @xmath97normalizable , then @xmath9 is an element of the spectrum of the problem with dirichlet boundary conditions @xmath98 .",
    "note again the importance of study the zeros of @xmath99 , in this case to know if a element of the spectrum is added or deleted .",
    "the confluent susy algorithm for the dirac equation has an extra liberty in the spectral design point of view .",
    "the presence of the constant @xmath18 in has no importance for the schrdinger equation because it can be interpreted as a shift of the zero energy point , which is arbitrary .",
    "if @xmath100 is an eigenvalue of then @xmath101 will be of , in the situation that it is not suppressed by the confluent susy algorithm . as a result",
    "the corresponding eigenvalue of the transformed dirac equation given in will be @xmath102 .",
    "the constant @xmath18 will shift every element of the spectrum in a non - linear fashion , and also the gap between the positive and negative elements of the spectrum can be modulated .",
    "we will now present three applications of the confluent susy algorithm for the dirac equation , involving potentials of physical interest . in the first application we study a coulomb - like potential , defined on the positive semiaxis .",
    "the second application is devoted to a linear potential plus a rational extension that is defined on the whole real line and features a link to the harmonic oscillator . in the last application we consider a trigonometric interaction on a bounded interval .",

    "we will now apply the confluent 2-susy algorithm to the boundary - value problem ( [ bvpx1 ] ) , ( [ bvpx2 ] ) , such that two values are removed from the discrete spectrum of the transformed problem .",
