    "reaction diffusion models in arbitrary spatial dimensions @xmath3 provide a plethora of intensively studied nonequilibrium many body systems  @xcite . one important challenge in studying those systems is to unveil the connection between the microscopic model and the emergent macroscopic physics by integrating out the short - range degrees of freedom . intriguingly , there are conditions under which certain macroscopic observables depend only weakly on the microscopic details .",
    "these universal quantities can be observed in low dimensional systems below the critical dimension @xmath4 where long - range fluctuations are significant enough to suppress the microscopic details .",
    "this fact allows one to classify reaction diffusion systems below the critical dimension by universal quantities such as critical exponents  @xcite . on the contrary",
    ", less effort has been made to investigate reaction diffusion systems above their critical dimension ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "one reason is that powerful perturbative approaches are conceptually restricted to @xmath6 and in general do not allow us to determine the subtle dependence of nonuniversal quantities on the microscopic details in @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , since simple mean field approaches provide a qualitatively correct description for @xmath5 , this regime is considered to be less interesting compared to @xmath6 .    despite the applicability of mean field calculations in @xmath5 ,",
    "the pair - annihilation process is worth studying above its critical dimension @xmath7 .",
    "as demonstrated in  @xcite , the mean field term for three - dimensional pair - annihilation is complemented by an additional nonanalytic correction term .",
    "the correction term originates from long - wavelength fluctuations and is expected to be important close to the critical dimension where the mean field approximation becomes unfaithful . in this paper we study the pair - annihilation process where the ordinary diffusing brownian particles are replaced by super diffusing lvy flyers .",
    "the motivation to study lvy flights is twofold .",
    "first of all , the jump length statistics of a lvy flyer leads to superdiffusive behavior , which is argued to be a ubiquitous phenomenon  @xcite and is observed in nature in various contexts , such as turbulence  @xcite , transport phenomena  @xcite , epidemic spreading  @xcite or the foraging of animals  @xcite . besides the practical relevance",
    ", superdiffusion has also evolved into a rich field of theoretical research  @xcite .",
    "second , from a technical point of view , lvy flights allow us to tune the critical dimension and thereby to probe the system close to criticality  @xcite .",
    "this enables us to examine the mechanism of the breakdown of mean field .",
    "we will see that in addition to the correction term known from the diffusive case  @xcite , a great number of further corrections become relevant as the critical dimension approaches the spatial dimension from below . by employing the formalism of nonperturbative renormalization group theory ( nprg ) , devised by wetterich et al .",
    "@xcite and elaborated in the context of reaction diffusion models by delamotte , canet et al .",
    "@xcite , the nonuniversal mean field term and the corrections are calculated .    the pair - annihilation process models chemical reactions of two identical particles reacting to an inert product .",
    "the process consists of two competing ingredients . on the one hand",
    ", the erratic motion of the particles leads to the stirring of the reactants . in the case of lvy flights ,",
    "the erratic dynamics is characterized by the slowly decaying power tail @xmath8 according to which the particles perform random jumps of length @xmath9 ( the control parameter @xmath10 is referred to as the lvy exponent ) . on the other hand",
    ", the annihilation reaction @xmath0 tends to build up anticorrelations between the particles and thereby works against the stirring  @xcite .",
    "the critical dimension @xmath4 divides the regime @xmath5 where the stirring is dominant such that mean field is valid from the regime @xmath6 where long - range anticorrelations lead to fractal - like reaction kinetics and the breakdown of mean field . as efficient",
    "stirring is in favor of the mean field assumption , the critical dimension is lowered for small values of @xmath11 where the probability for long jumps is high .",
    "this allows us to use the lvy exponent @xmath11 as a control parameter to adjust the critical dimension and probe the system close to criticality",
    ". we will see that @xmath12 .    for",
    "asymptotically late times @xmath13 , the density decay in @xmath0 is known to obey the power law  @xcite @xmath14 the results for ordinary diffusion are formally obtained by setting @xmath15 . instead of looking at the density decay in time , a different , though related question , is to determine the steady state density if the additional particle input @xmath16 with rate @xmath17 is included .",
    "this leads to the scaling law @xmath18 for asymptotically small and homogeneous particle input @xmath17 .",
    "the exponents @xmath19 and @xmath20 are related by @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "the behavior for @xmath5 is correctly predicted by mean field which , in the context of reaction kinetics , is called the law of mass action .",

    "the corrected steady state equation then reads @xmath301 . as the corrections are generated by the flow of the reaction rate , the amplitudes @xmath281",
    "are universal functions of the macroscopic rate and have been computed exactly .",
    "when the relative distance @xmath302 to the critical dimension is small , the exponents of the nonanalytic terms are close to @xmath287 and many summands add up coherently .",
    "this compensates the loss of significance of the analytic law of mass action term due to the decay of @xmath1 .",
    "we have seen that the correction terms are essential in the one - dimensional case . in two dimensions ,",
    "one has to distinguish whether the lvy flights are implemented via @xmath74 or @xmath77 .",
    "interestingly , the corrections turn out to be less important when the former implementation is used .",
