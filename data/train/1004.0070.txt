    "it was shown recently how to calculate the cross section for exclusive production of heavy quarkonia in the @xmath5 @xcite as well as in @xmath6 @xcite collisions within the @xmath7-factorization approach .",

    "the corresponding cross section is however very small and can not be measured at present luminosities .    in order to describe the photoproduction process in a strict pqcd framework ,",
    "at least a hard scale must be present , which could be for example either a quark mass for heavy quarkonia , or a large photon virtuality for deep inelastic diffractive processes .",
    "the @xmath7factorization formalism described in @xcite allows , however , a smooth continuation from the hard to soft regime , and therefore can be also used to model the photoproduction of light vector mesons .",
    "this derives from the fact that the @xmath7factorization is a momentum space version of the color ",

    "the azimuthal angle dependence found here is of purely interference nature .",
    "quite different distributions have been predicted for the tevatron and lhc due to the different sign of the interference term ( different electric charge of proton and antiproton ) .",

    "one could measure the @xmath4 meson either in the lepton - antilepton or in kaon - antikaon decay channels .",
