    "the standard model ( sm ) suffers from shortcomings , such as the hierarchy problem , little higgs model offers an alternative route to solve this problem @xcite .",
    "the littlest higgs ( lh ) model is the most economical implementation of the little higgs idea @xcite , but which is found to be subject to strong constraints from electroweak precision tests @xcite . in order to evade such restrictions on the lh model , one of the most attractive models",
    "is proposed which is just the littlest higgs model with t - parity ( lht ) @xcite , where the discrete symmetry named  t - parity \" forbids tree - level corrections to electroweak observables , thus weakening the electroweak precision constraints . in the lht model ,",
    "the flavor structure is richer than the that of the sm , mainly due to the presence of three doublets of mirror quarks and leptons that interact with the ordinary quarks and leptons .",
    "the appearance of the new flavor - changing ( fc ) interactions in the lht model can have crucial phenomenology at the high energy colleders and studied in ref . @xcite . as we know",
    ", the sm does not exist the tree - level fc neutral currents , though it can occur at higher order through radiative corrections , and these effects are hardly to be observed because of the loop suppression .",
    "the new fc interactions in the lht model could significantly enhance the fc processes which can make some fc processes observable .",
    "hence the fc processes provide an excellent opportunity to probe new physics due to their clean sm backgrounds .",
    "the fc interactions in the lht model could induce the loop - level @xmath2 and @xmath3 couplings .",
    "the @xmath2 coupling can contribute to the rare top quark decays @xmath4 @xcite and some fc production processes @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , ref .",
    "@xcite has performed a collective study for the various fc decays of @xmath5-meson , @xmath6-boson and higgs boson , and it is found that the lht predictions obviously deviate from the sm predictions .",
    "the final states of @xmath7 can be produced via the fc interactions . at the linear collider ,",
    "the production process @xmath8 has been investigated in the sm @xcite , the topcolor - assistant multiscale technicolor model @xcite , and the the 4 generation standard model @xcite .",
    "in addition , the production process @xmath9 was also discussed in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is worthy to probe the production processes @xmath10 in the lht model at the international linear collider ( ilc ) .",
    "although the lhc will essentially enlarge the possibilities of testing for new physics effects , the analysis of new physics processes at lhc is complicated . an @xmath11 facility with clean environments",
    "( and , potentially , with various options such as @xmath12 and @xmath13 collision modes ) is required to complement this hadron machine in drawing a comprehensive and high - resolution picture of electroweak symmetry breaking and of the new physics beyond the sm .",
    "the ilc @xcite , which is currently being designed , would be an excellent counterpart to lhc .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly review the lht model . sec .",
    "iii presents the detailed calculation of the production cross sections of the processes .",
    "the numerical results are shown in sec .",
    "finally , a short conclusion was given in sec .",
    "the original lh model@xcite , which is based on a non - linear sigma model , begins with @xmath14 global symmetry , with a locally gauged subgroup @xmath15\\otimes[su(2)_2\\otimes u(1)_2]$ ] . with the elegant breaking mode of the global symmetry group @xmath14 and the special structure of the gauge symmetry group @xmath16 , the discrete symmetry group @xmath17 dubbed ",
    "t - parity \" can be facilely implemented in the lh model , which makes the explicit group structures of the lht model .    from the @xmath18 breaking at the scale @xmath19 ,",
    "there arise 14 nambu - goldstone bosons which are described by the  pion \" matrix @xmath20 , given explicitly by @xmath21 the fields @xmath22 and @xmath23 are goldstone bosons eaten by new t - odd heavy gauge bosons @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , which obtain masses at @xmath27 @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the sm @xmath31 and @xmath32 gauge couplings , respectively .    according to the t - parity in the lht model ,",
    "the t - even fermion section consists of the sm quarks , leptons and a color triplet heavy quark @xmath33 , and the t - odd fermion sector consists first of all of three generations of mirror quarks and leptons with vectorial couplings @xmath34 and a t - odd heavy top quark @xmath35 . in this paper",
    "only mirror quarks are relevant which are denoted by    @xmath36    with their masses satisfying to first order in @xmath37 @xmath38    for completeness we would like to mention that the sm electroweak gauge bosons ( @xmath39 ) are belong to the t - even sector and a higgs triplet @xmath40 belongs to the t - odd sector .",
    "the charged higgs @xmath41 , as well as the neutral higgses @xmath42 , @xmath43 , are relevant in principle for the production processes considerated in our paper , but their effects turn out to be of high order in @xmath44 @xcite , and consequently similarly to @xmath45 will not enter our analysis .",
    "one of the most important ingredients of the mirror quark sector is the existence of the flavor violating actions between the sm fermions and the mirror fermions which are mediated by the t - odd heavy gauge bosons , which leads to the appearance of two ckm - like unitary mixing matrices @xmath46 and @xmath47 , that satisfy @xmath48 the notation indicates the type of light fermion that is involved in the interaction , i.e. if it is of up- or down - type .",
    "following @xcite we will parameterize @xmath47 generalizing the usual ckm parameterisation , as a product of three rotations , and introducing a complex phase in each of them , thus obtaining @xmath49 as in the case of the ckm matrix the angles @xmath50 can all be made lie in the first quadrant with @xmath51 .",
    "the matrix @xmath46 is then determined through @xmath52 .",
    "in the lht model , the feynman diagrams of the process @xmath53 are shown in fig.1 ( a ) and the feynman diagrams of the process @xmath54 are shown in fig.1 ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "the black square in fig .",
    "1 denotes the effective fc couplings @xmath55 which were presented in fig.2 . as we have mentioned above",
    ", there are fc interactions between sm fermions and mirror fermions which are mediated by the heavy gauge bosons ( @xmath56 ) or goldstone bosons ( @xmath57 ) under t hooft - feynman gauge .",
    "therefore , we also plot the diagrams involving the goldstone bosons @xmath23 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 in fig.2 .",
    "in addition , the goldstone boson mass is conveniently taken the same of its corresponding gauge boson , i.e. @xmath60 and @xmath61 . with the fc couplings given by ref .",
    "@xcite , the loop - level fc couplings @xmath62 can be induced .",
    "one important difference of the @xmath63 vertex in @xmath8 and in @xmath64 is both the quarks are on - shell for @xmath8 , while for @xmath65 , either @xmath66 or @xmath67 is off - shell , which is almost effortless to find from fig.1 . in order to simplify calculation ,",
    "we d better obtain an universal form of the @xmath68 vertex which can be applied to the both cases , and the best possible way was suggested by @xcite . in our calculation , we use the method in @xcite to get the effective @xmath69 vertex @xmath70 and @xmath71 , which can be directly calculated based on fig.2 and represented in form of 2-point and 3-point standard functions @xmath72 . because the analytical expressions are lengthy and tedious",
    ", we will not present them in our paper .",
    "we calculate the amplitudes numerically by using the looptools @xcite .",
    "there are several free parameters in the lht model which are involved in the amplitudes of @xmath73 .",
    "they are the breaking scale @xmath74 , the masses of the mirror quarks @xmath75 ( we take @xmath76 , as in equation ( 4 ) ) , and 6 parameters ( @xmath77 ) which are related to the mixing matrix @xmath47 . for the parameter @xmath74 , we take two discrete typical value in our calculation , i.e. @xmath78 gev and 1000 gev , according to the investigation of @xcite which pointed out that the value of @xmath74 can be as low as 500 gev .    in refs . @xcite",
    ", the constraints on the mass spectrum of the mirror fermions have been probed in the study of neutral meson mixing in the @xmath79 and @xmath80 systems .",
    "they show that a tev scale gim suppression is necessary for a generic choice of @xmath47 . however , there are regions of parameter space where are only very loose constraints on the mass spectrum of the mirror fermions . for the mixing matrix @xmath47 ,",
    "we take two scenarios for these parameters according to @xcite and fulfill our calculation : @xmath81 @xmath82 to fix matrix @xmath47 in case ii , we adopt the upper limit and down limit of @xmath83 , respectively , @xmath84 @xmath85 in both the above cases , the constraints on the mass spectrum of the mirror fermions are very relaxed . on the other hand , ref .",
    "@xcite has shown that the experimental bounds on four - fermi interactions involving sm fields provide an upper bound on the mirror fermion masses and this yields @xmath86 . here",
    ", we also consider such constraint and let @xmath87 to vary in the range of @xmath88 gev and @xmath89 gev when @xmath78 gev and 1000 gev respectively .",
    "meanwhile , we fix @xmath90=500 gev .    in the numerical calculation , there are also a set of independent input parameters , and they are @xmath914.2 gev , @xmath920.095 gev , @xmath93 gev , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 @xcite . for the c.m .",
    "energies of the ilc , we choose @xmath96 gev and 1000 gev according to @xcite . the final numerical results are shown in figs.3 - 5 .     in the lht model for case",
    "i , as a function of @xmath87.,title=\"fig:\",width=268,height=268 ]   in the lht model for case i , as a function of @xmath87.,title=\"fig:\",width=268,height=268 ] +     in the lht model for case ii(1 ) , as a function of @xmath87.,title=\"fig:\",width=268,height=268 ]   in the lht model for case ii(1 ) , as a function of @xmath87.,title=\"fig:\",width=268,height=268 ] +     in the lht model for case ii(2 ) , as a function of @xmath87.,title=\"fig:\",width=268,height=268 ]   in the lht model for case ii(2 ) , as a function of @xmath87.,title=\"fig:\",width=268,height=268 ] +    in figs.3 - 5 , we plot the cross sections of the processes @xmath10 as a function of @xmath87 for case i , case ii(1 ) and case ii(2 ) , respectively , and other relevant parameters were presented in the corresponding figure . from these figures",
    ", we can see the following : ( i ) the cross sections of the processes become larger with the @xmath87 increasing .",
    "this is because these processes proceed in a way quite similar to the gim mechanism of the sm , so the more significant the mass splitting between the mirror quarks , the larger the rates become . and",
    "hence , through the detection of these production process , one can set some constrains on the masses of the mirror quarks .",
    "( ii ) it is evident that the cross section of @xmath1 is larger than that of @xmath8 in the whole @xmath87 region , and the difference between these two cross sections is about one or two orders of magnitude . in general",
    ", this is because the process @xmath8 occurs only via s - channel , so its rate is suppressed by the photon propagator and the @xmath6 propagator .",
    "however , the process @xmath1 may overcome this handicap .",
    "therefore , for the production of @xmath7 , the @xmath13 collider has more advantage than the @xmath97 collider in the lht model .",
    "( iii ) the figures illustrate that the cross sections of the processes @xmath73 are quite different for the different schemes of the parameterization of the mixing matrix @xmath47 , especially for case ii(2 ) illustrated in fig.3 and case i illustrated in fig.5 , which demonstrate that the cross sections are strongly dependent on the parameterization scheme of @xmath47 .",
    "the possible reason for such difference is the parameters configuration of the mixing matrix @xmath47 , and such difference could help us to confirm the flavor structure of the lht model and then to validate the parameterization of the mixing matrix @xmath47 if these production processes could be detected at the ilc .",
    "( iv ) the cross sections of the processes @xmath10 are insensitive to the scale @xmath74 .",
    "the reason is that the masses of the heavy gauge bosons @xmath98 and the mirror quarks @xmath75 are proportional to @xmath74 , but the production amplitudes are represented in the form of @xmath99 which cancels the effect of @xmath74 .",
    "so it is too much to expect that the detection of these processes could make some constrains on the scale @xmath74 .",
    "note that in our numerical evaluation , only the new particles of the lht model which are not belong to the sm are concerned .",
    "and that , even the new particles whose effects turn out to be of high order in @xmath44 do not enter our analysis as mentioned above .",
    "our results show that the cross section of process @xmath8 in the lht model is higher than the value of sm which the cross section @xmath100 is of the order of @xmath101 @xcite . based on the above discussion , we know that the lht model has the potential to produce large amounts of @xmath7 events . with the large yearly luminosity @xmath102 and @xmath96 gev at ilc @xcite , about @xmath103 @xmath7 events per year can be produced for case ii(2 ) illustrated in fig.5 .",
    "such a signal should appear in the detector as an event with one b - jet and one light - quark - jet ( assuming no distinction is made among light quarks : @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 ) .",
    "the efficiency to identify b - quark is about @xmath107 and the signal of one b - quark jet and one light - quark - jet is certainly fc signal .",
    "although b - quark can be misidentified as c - quarks , there are still enough @xmath7 can be identified . because the @xmath7 production is a fc process",
    ", the sm background should be very clean .",
    "if a luminosity reaches @xmath108 , the @xmath7 signal with cross section @xmath109 could be observed @xcite . therefore , with a yearly luminosity @xmath110 at the ilc , @xmath7 signal should be observable if lht model is right .",
    "in this paper , we study the processes @xmath10 in the framework of the lht model at the ilc .",
    "our results show that the cross sections of these processes are strongly dependent on the masses of the third generation mirror quarks @xmath87 and the parameterization of the mixing matrix @xmath47 . and that , the production rate of these process are sizeable for the favorable values of the parameter .",
    "hence , it is quite possible to test the lht model or make some constrains on the relevant parameters of the lht through the detection of theses process .",
    "we would like to thank junjie cao and lei wu for helpful discussions and suggestions .",
