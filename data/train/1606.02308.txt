    "the broken translational symmetry at an interface between complex metal oxides gives rise to a number of remarkable phenomena with rich physics often due to charge , spin , orbital , or atomic reconstruction , such as superconductivity @xcite , metal - insulator transitions @xcite , and giant magnetoresistance @xcite .",
    "these phenomena can be entirely different from those innate to the constituent materials@xcite .",
    "a recent example of such interface phenomena is the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) at the interface of laalo@xmath1 ( lao ) and @xmath2-terminated srtio@xmath1(sto ) @xcite . despite that lao and sto",
    "are both band insulators and non - magnetic , their interface is found to be conductive @xcite , superconductive @xcite , ferromagnetic @xcite and exhibits an electric - field tunable metal - insulator transition @xcite , which all are the result of electronic reconstruction at the interface . most of the mentioned properties can be altered by applying a back gate , which varies the electron density at the interface@xcite .",
    "it is generally agreed that the electron gas is formed by transfer of electrons from the polar layers of lao to the top tio@xmath7 layer of sto @xcite .",
    "in addition to the electronic reconstruction at the interface , doping the interface by interdiffusion of la / sr atoms @xcite and by the presence of oxygen vacancies that are created in the sto substrate during thin film deposition @xcite contributes to the conductivity . in the electronic reconstruction model , donors ultimately originate from the surface of lao .",
    "they come from the interface or within sto in the other two mechanisms .",
    "the reason for cation mixing is thought to be the reduction in the dipole energy at the interface , and it has been shown that la@xmath8sr@xmath9tio@xmath1 ( @xmath10 ) is metallic@xcite .",
    "it was also experimentally@xcite and theoretically@xcite demonstrated that varying oxygen pressure during growth results in dramatic changes in interfacial conductivity .",
    "moreover , conductivity found at the interface of sto and amorphous lao@xcite , suggest that oxygen vacancies can be dominant source of mobile carriers .",
    "oxygen post - annealing of the amorphous samples fills the oxygen vacancies , and the interface becomes insulating .",
    "strong spin - orbit ( so ) coupling effects whose magnitude can be modulated by the application of an external electric field has been observed for the lao / sto interface through magnetotransport studies@xcite .",
    "this so coupling effect that arises from the broken inversion symmetry at the interface lifts the spin degeneracy of the 2deg and is known as rashba spin splitting@xcite . unlike in semiconductor heterostructures , interfacial carriers at the lao / sto interface reside in the 3__d__-_t@xmath11 _ conduction band of sto , potentially affecting the strength of the so coupling@xcite .",
    "density - functional - theory calculations@xcite show a large so coupling effect around the @xmath12 point , either with standard _ k_-linear rashba spin splitting or with a cubic dependence on the wave vector , depending on the sign of the _ xy _ sub - band splitting .",
    "similar interfaces such as the interface of sto and pralo@xmath1@xcite , ndalo@xmath1 @xcite , lagao@xmath1@xcite , ndgao@xmath1@xcite and latio@xmath1@xcite , where the film is polar , have all shown conductivity . most of these interfaces have a higher lattice mismatch and stronger localization of carriers relative to that of lao / sto , which result in different transport mechanisms and properties .    in order to examine the importance of the rare - earth cation r on the transport properties of the 2deg at ralo@xmath1/sto interfaces",
    ", we have investigated the system with r = pr , that is the interface between pralo@xmath1 ( pao ) and sto . among the aluminates , pao has the closest lattice constant to lao ( due to the multivalancy of ce , it is hard to make stable thin films of cealo@xmath1 ) , and thus this helps to lessen the effect of strain as much as possible .",
    "the effective magnetic moment of pr is 3.6 bohr magnetons , due to _ f _ electron states , often hybridized , while closed shell is diamagnetic@xcite , thus this rare - earth substitution can lead to magnetic properties in an aluminate structure . in bulk",
    ", pao is known to be paramagnetic and has mostly been studied for its structural transitions below room temperature which are absent in lao@xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ experiments ] contains our experimental method for synthesizing and characterizing samples .",
    "section [ results ] contains our experimental results of resistance as a function of temperature and magnetoresistance as a function of magnetic field for samples that are made at different oxygen pressures during growth .",
    "comparison with theoretical concepts are made .",

    "the tio@xmath7-terminated srtio@xmath1 ( 001 ) substrate was prepared by etching the substrate in buffered hydrofluoric ( hf ) acid for one minute and then by thermal annealling at @xmath13 for 2 hours . to keep the effect of the substrate defect constant ,",
    "a single substrate was cut into equal pieces to be used for depositing the different samples .",

    "the laser pulse energy was 100 mj , the fluence of the laser was @xmath17 3 and the repetition rate was 1 hz .",
    "after deposition , the samples were post annealed for 30 minutes and then cooled down to room temperature , both in the same oxygen pressure as during deposition .",
    "the quality of the terminated substrate and the thin film samples were further confirmed by atomic force microscopy ( afm ) using a veeco nanoscope , ex situ at room temperature using tapping mode .",

    "the room temperature resistivity increases as the samples are prepared at higher oxygen pressure .",
    "while there is only less than a factor of 2 in growth pressure difference between the @xmath14 torr and @xmath23 torr samples , their room temperature resistivities differ by three orders of magnitudes . in the case of the lao / sto interface",
    ", it is known that oxygen vacancies can provide intragap donor levels close to the conduction band of sto@xcite .",
    "higher oxygen pressure during growth tends to fill the oxygen vacancies , thus causing the room temperature @xmath22 to increase .",
    "the lowest oxygen - pressure - grown sample shows a metallic behavior from room temperature down to 2 k. the resistivity for this sample levels off below 10 k. we also treated an sto substrate under the deposition conditions , without an actual film on it , but it turned out to be very resistive and we were not able to measure any measurable conductance for it .",
    "the question of whether oxygen vacancies or cation intermixing are in fact responsible for the observed conduction still remains .",
    "the very low sheet resistance indicates that the conduction layer is much thicker for @xmath14 torr sample and the transport must occur in a region many layers thick . for @xmath24 and @xmath25 torr o@xmath7 growth pressure ,",

    "these variations in @xmath22 suggest that different types of transport mechanisms are operating at the interface .",
    "some of the scattering processes that result in an upturn in resistivity are : scattering from localized magnetic moments ( kondo effect ) , weak localization ( wl ) , and variable range hopping due to strong localization .",

    "the in - plane mr values are smaller for most of the samples , but for the @xmath26 torr sample they are larger .",
    "the positive part of the mr , which we assign to strong so interaction , is very small for the @xmath48 torr sample and it is negligible for the @xmath49 torr sample for the in - plane orientation . for the high @xmath0 sample , in which carriers are just coming from electronic reconstruction and there are very few oxygen vacancies present , the in - plane data are smaller than corresponding out - of - plane data .",

    "in summary , we examined the behavior of the conductivity at the interface between pralo@xmath50 and srtio@xmath51 ; we studied the electric and magnetic transport properties of interfaces of pao / sto grown at oxygen pressures in the @xmath0 range of @xmath14  @xmath15 torr . for the @xmath14 torr sample the very small value of @xmath22 at low temperature , large carrier concentration , high mobilities , and very high positive mr values",

    "the mr values for the @xmath25 and @xmath26 torr samples were modeled with their positive part due to wal because of a strong so interaction and their negative part due to the kondo effect .",
    "the variation of mr values suggests a strong so interaction for the @xmath53 torr sample with @xmath54 = 1.25 t in both field orientations . the positive part of the mr shrinks for the @xmath48 and @xmath49 torr samples . for these samples",
    "the mr is dominated by negative kondo mr at high fields .",
    "the 2deg has the lowest carrier density for the @xmath49 torr sample , and comparison of mr values with theory suggest a high kondo field scale @xmath5511 t for this sample for both field orientations .",
