    "during the past few decades powerful numerical methods have been developed for the ab - initio ( first - principles ) calculation of the electronic ground - state properties of solids . in most of these methods",
    "density - functional theory@xcite ( dft ) has been used to treat the electron - electron coulomb repulsion , and a local - density approximation@xcite ( lda ) ( or a local spin - density approximation , lsda , for magnetic systems ) has been used for the exchange - correlation potential .",
    "this procedure has been very successful for many materials and ground - state properties ( e.g. , crystal structure , lattice constant , binding energy , and ionization energy ) , but it has its limitations ; the band gap of semiconductors is not properly reproduced , for instance .",
    "furthermore , for systems such as high - temperature superconductors , heavy fermion materials , transition - metal oxides , and 3d itinerant magnets , i.e. , for systems in which the fermi level falls into a region of narrow energy bands , the lda is usually not sufficient .",
    "it is generally accepted that the problem for these materials is the strong electronic correlations that are responsible for their electronic properties . for a description of such strongly correlated systems",
    "one usually instead uses as a starting point model hamiltonians like the hubbard model@xcite and its multi - band generalizations .",
    "but in these models the coulomb ( interaction ) matrix elements and also the one - particle ( hopping ) matrix elements that determine the unperturbed band structure are usually treated as free , adjustable parameters , i.e. , they are not known from ",
    "first principles  for the given material ; on the other hand , coulomb correlations can be studied within reliable many - body approximations that go beyond the hartree - fock approximation .",
    "both the ab - initio lda and the many - body model - hamiltonian methods based on hubbard - like models have their merits , but until rather recently they have been almost separate and complementary approaches .",
    "but , in view of the power of each , a combination of these methods is desirable ; and , in fact , during the last few years there have been some attempts in this direction.@xcite all of these recent developments add local , screened coulomb ( hubbard ) correlations u between localized orbitals to the one - particle part of the hamiltonian obtained from an ab - initio lda band - structure calculation , but differ in how they handle the correlation part . in the earliest attempts ,",
    "the lda+u method@xcite used essentially a static mean - field - like ( or hubbard - i - like ) approximation for the correlation .",
    "the simplest approximation beyond hartree - fock , second - order perturbation theory ( sopt ) in u , was used@xcite to study the electronic properties of 3d - systems ( like fe and ni ) and heavy fermion systems ( like upt@xmath1 ) .",
    "the lda++ approach@xcite has a similar strategy , but uses other many - body approximations to treat the correlation problem , namely , either the fluctuation exchange approximation ( flex ) or the dynamical mean field theory@xcite ( dmft ) .",
    "some of the other many - body treatments@xcite have also used dmft , which is based on the limit of large - dimension ( @xmath2 ) approximation for correlated lattice electrons.@xcite within dmft the selfenergy becomes local , i.e. , independent of momentum @xmath3 , which allows a mapping of the lattice problem onto an effective impurity model .",
    "the lda+dmft treatments@xcite mentioned above differ in the many - body method they used for the effective impurity problem , namely , quantum monte carlo@xcite ( qmc ) , the non - crossing approximation@xcite ( nca ) or ( iterated ) perturbation theory@xcite ( ipt ) . but all these approaches , including the lda+u , have in common that they have to introduce a hubbard u as an additional parameter , and hence are not real first - principles ( ab - initio ) treatments .",
    "although they use an lda ab - initio method to obtain a realistic band structure , i.e. , single - particle properties , coulomb matrix elements for any particular material are not known , and the hubbard u remains an adjustable parameter .    one can obtain estimates on the magnitude of @xmath0 either from experiment ( high - energy spectroscopy ) or from the constrained lda method.@xcite within the latter method one adds the constraint that the electron occupation number for the correlated bands is fixed to a given number through a lagrange parameter .",
    "one can then use lda to calculate the ground - state energy for different occupations of the correlated states , and the difference between the energy for double and single occupation is an estimate for the hubbard u. this method has the advantage that effects of screening are already somehow included . on the other hand there are usually several bands and many interaction matrix elements ( on - site , density - density , intra - band , inter - band , exchange , inter - site , etc . ) that have different magnitudes , and the constrained lda can only give some average value for these various coulomb matrix elements and not the individual ab - initio parameters ( coulomb matrix elements ) .",
    "this approach is intuitive and contains some type of screening within a one - electron lda approach .",
    "it is difficult to sort out the actual approximation involved .    in this paper",
    "we suggest a different approach , namely , the direct ab - initio calculation of the one - particle ( tight - binding ) and two - particle ( coulomb ) matrix elements . our starting point is a standard electronic band - structure calculation , for which we have used the linearized muffin - tin orbital ( lmto ) method@xcite within the atomic sphere approximation ( asa ) .",
    "the lda band - structure calculation yields not only one - particle energies but also their eigenstates , the bloch wavefunctions , which form a proper basis of a one - particle hilbert space . to determine the local ( on- and inter - site ) coulomb matrix elements it is necessary to construct wannier functions,@xcite which are closely related to the bloch functions via a unitary transformation , but which are not unique since the phases of the bloch functions are undetermined .    as first suggested by marzari and vanderbilt,@xcite this gauge freedom",
    "can be used to construct `` maximally localized wannier functions . ''",
    "those are just wannier functions with a special gauge that makes them optimally localized according to some criterion .",
    "a proper localization of the wannier functions is important in our opinion , because only then do the standard assumptions of the model treatments hold such that only a few ( on - site , nearest , and next - nearest neighbor ) one - particle ( hopping ) and two - particle ( coulomb ) matrix elements have to be considered explicitely .",
    "these matrix elements can then be calculated from the wannier functions .",
    "we use two different methods to calculate coulomb matrix elements from wannier functions .",
    "the first method uses the fact that the lmto - method provides bloch functions in the basis of linear muffin - tin orbitals.@xcite therefore the wannier functions are given as linear combinations of such muffin - tin orbitals as well , and can be used to evaluate the coulomb integrals efficiently , similarly to what was done in ref .  .",
    "the second method uses a fast fourier transformation ( fft ) .",
    "it does not rely on the property of the wave functions being linear and is therefore more general .",
    "it is also very quick and efficient .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : comp ] we present some of the computational details : we describe the form of the bloch functions in the lmto method , how to obtain the wannier functions from them , and how to optimize the choice of the wannier functions by using the marzari - vanderbilt method .",
    "then we describe how the one - particle ( hopping ) matrix elements are obtained from these localized wannier functions , and we present the two methods to calculate the coulomb matrix elements . to illustrate the method we have performed actual calculations for a well understood system , namely for cu .",
    "although this material is not a strongly correlated system , it has almost completely filled , narrow , 3d - bands , for which ( well localized ) wannier functions and one- and two - particle matrix elements can be calculated .",
    "results for cu are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : res ] , where we show some of the wannier functions , demonstrate how well localized they are and that the one - particle ( tight - binding ) matrix elements obtained from them allow for a reconstruction of the band structure .",
    "the direct coulomb matrix elements obtained are rather large , between 20 and 25 ev for wannier states with mainly 3d - character , and are about 5 ev for nearest neighbors , and about 1 ev for exchange interactions . in sec .",
    "[ sec : constrain ] we describe constrained lda calculations , which yield somewhat smaller values ( about 18 ev ) for the hubbard u of cu , and in the final section ( [ conc ] ) we discuss how to extend and further apply the current approach .",
    "we restrict ourself to the case where there is only one atom per unit cell and where we can neglect spin ( non - spin - polarized calculations ) . for a given material",
    "the only input to an ab - initio lda calculation is the atomic number . in the density - functional approach,@xcite",
    "a local - density approximation is normally used for the exchange and correlation interactions between the electrons ; we have used the von barth - hedin@xcite exchange - correlation potential and a frozen - core approximation . within dft",
    "the total energy of the ground state could be calculated as a function of volume for a given crystal structure and used to determine the equilibrium lattice constant ; it is usually in good agreement with experiment .",
    "however , since our focus is on the determination of coulomb matrix elements in a wannier basis , we have simply used the experimental lattice parameters .      for our band - structure results",
    "we have used the lmto method@xcite within the atomic sphere approximation ( asa ) .",
    "the combined correction term@xcite was not included .",
    "the muffin - tin spheres are overlapping and their radius ( the wigner - seitz radius @xmath4 ) is determined by the condition that the sphere volume equals the volume of the unit cell . within the muffin - tin spheres the potential and wave functions are expanded in spherical harmonics with a cutoff @xmath5 , i.e. , s , p , d , and f - orbitals are included .",
    "furthermore the bloch wave functions are given in terms of the solution to the radial schrdinger equation @xmath6 to some fixed energies @xmath7 and its energy derivative @xmath8 : @xmath9 where we use complex spherical harmonics in all of our calculations .",
    "this expansion is valid in one muffin - tin sphere . here , as usual , @xmath10 is understood and @xmath11 is the band index and @xmath12 is the wave vector .",
    "we define @xmath11 by the condition that @xmath13 .",
    "the virtue of using this method for wannier functions is the simplification that only integrals over spheres are needed ; no real - space integrations over complicated wigner - seitz ( unit ) cells are required .",
    "the bloch functions obey @xmath14 therefore , the knowledge of a bloch function in a single muffin - tin sphere is sufficient for the knowledge of the function in the whole crystal .",
    "this situation is different when we consider wannier functions , which can be centered on different sites .",
    "it is useful to introduce a notation that holds for both bloch and wannier functions . to do this",
    "we perform an expansion like eq .",
    "( [ eq : lmto - wave ] ) in each muffin - tin sphere , which we label by its site vector @xmath15 . the complete wave function ( either bloch or wannier )",
    "is then given by : @xmath16 in this equation we have used the general notation for the wave function expansion @xmath17 such that : ( i ) @xmath18 is any kind of wave function .",
    "( ii ) the @xmath19 stands for quantum numbers ( bloch : @xmath20 ; wannier : @xmath21 ) .",
    "( iii ) the first argument in the parenthesis indicates the muffin - tin sphere about which we are expanding and is labeled by its site vector .",
    "( iv ) the second argument in the parenthesis is the position inside this muffin - tin sphere described by its relative vector .",
    "this means that this vector has zero length in the center of the muffin - tin sphere described by the first argument .",
    "( v ) note that , for every @xmath22 , @xmath23 in the case where @xmath18 is a bloch function we find @xmath24 it is easy to see that eq .",
    "( [ eq : basa ] ) inserted in eq .",
    "( [ eq : asa ] ) obeys eq .",
    "( [ eq : bloch ] ) .    also note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : asa ] ) disregards the effects of overlapping muffin - tin spheres . within the asa approximation ,",
    "all derivations are done as though non - overlapping muffin - tins are being used , and then these formulas are used with expanded muffin - tins , whose volumes sum to equal the unit cell volume ( where the muffin - tin radius is expanded to a wigner - seitz radius for one atom per unit cell ) . in addition , this approximate eliminates the necessity to handle interstitial regions , and hence the asa formalism is mathematically much simpler than a full - potential electronic - structure calculation would require .      in this section we show how to calculate wannier functions from the lmto type of bloch functions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : lmto - wave ] ) .",
    "the wannier functions@xcite are defined by @xmath25 here , @xmath26 is the number of @xmath12-mesh points in the brillouin zone or , equivalently , the number of unit cells in the real space supercell that is used to discretize the @xmath12-mesh . as mentioned above ,",
    "wannier functions are not unique .",
    "consider , for example , a single band @xmath11 with bloch functions @xmath27 ; a transformation of the kind @xmath28 will still lead to bloch functions .",
    "we shall call this a gauge transformation of the first kind . in the case of a composite set of bands,@xcite this nonuniqueness corresponds to the freedom to choose the phases and `` band - index labeling '' at each @xmath12 point of the bloch functions : @xmath29 we shall call this a gauge transformation of the second kind . here",
    "@xmath30 is a unitary matrix .",
    "from all the arbitrary choices of wannier functions we will pick out that particular set that minimizes the total spread given by @xmath31 ~.\\ ] ] for any operator @xmath32 , @xmath33 denotes the expectation value @xmath34 . a method for minimizing eq .",
    "( [ eq : om ] ) has been developed by marzari and vanderbilt@xcite and its application to the asa wave functions does not pose any particular problems ( details will be given below ) .    before minimizing @xmath35 according to this procedure ,",
    "it is useful to prepare the bloch orbitals to make the starting wannier functions somewhat localized .",
    "this has two advantages : ( i ) the minimization procedure converges faster , and ( ii ) this helps avoid getting trapped in local minima .",
    "marzari and vanderbilt@xcite suggest several possible preparations .",
    "we have found our own method , which seems to work well .",
    "this involves a simple gauge transformation for each band , which is given by @xmath36 this gauge transformation has the property that @xmath37 transforms to zero .",
    "so at the point @xmath38 all the bloch functions will have the same phase ( in this case just @xmath39 ) and @xmath40 will take a large value .",
    "we thus expect the wannier function to be fairly localized at @xmath41 . to make the method work well one should choose @xmath41 where the wannier functions are expected to be reasonably large . in our calculations",
    "we have chosen the direction of this vector to be well away from the expected zeroes of the spherical harmonics and with an absolute value far enough away from the origin to be in a place where the wannier functions should have a significant magnitude .",
    "we found an @xmath41 of ( 0.8 , 1.0 , 0.3)@xmath42 to work well for fcc cu .",
    "we shall now derive expressions of the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : asa ] ) for wannier functions . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : basa ] ) and ( [ eq : wdef ] ) we have @xmath43 because wannier functions on different sites have the same form ( shape ) of their wave functions and differ only by a translation of their origin , it is useful to use a notation that indicates values of a wave function relative to a wannier function centered at the origin : @xmath44 where we have introduced the notation @xmath45",
    "( i.e. , if the subscript contains only a wave function label without a spatial vector @xmath22 , then we are using a relative notation that refers to a wannier function centered at the origin ) .",

    "for this notation to work in our numerical calculations , it is essential to force the wannier center , i.e. , the muffin - tin sphere where @xmath48 is largest , to be at the muffin - tin sphere around the lattice site @xmath49 ; we achieve this by setting @xmath50 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : il ] ) . in most of the rest of the paper",
    ", we will almost always use the relative notation that refers to wannier states centered at the origin , and will perform whatever translations are necessary to be able to use these states .    in the method of marzari and vanderbilt,@xcite the starting point for the calculations",

    "( [ eq : sh3 ] ) and ( [ eq : sh2 ] ) and solved the remaining integral by using eq .",
    "( [ eq : i3 ] ) .",
    "we used a uniform ( cubic ) discrete @xmath12-mesh with a spacing @xmath54 of @xmath55 .",
    "in such a mesh there are 6 nearest - neighbors for the @xmath52 vectors needed for the numerical derivatives .",
    "we were careful not to double count vectors in the @xmath56-mesh ( those equivalent to each other by a reciprocal lattice vector ) within the brillouin zone ( which has 500 @xmath12 points in the full zone ) .",
    "we then used the steepest - descent method and relevant equations in sec .",
    "iv of ref .   to iterate a series of small steps where a set of @xmath57 were calculated and used to update the unitary matrices @xmath58 and the @xmath59 matrices . after each iteration ,",
    "where we update all the relevant @xmath12 matrices , we calculated the spread function @xmath35 , and continued iterating until this converged .    in these calculations the initial matrices @xmath60 are by far the most time consuming computationally ( it requires storing @xmath61 complex numbers ) .",
    "the iterations of the steepest descent method were much faster .",
    "for this reason we used many iterations ( about 1500 steps ) and converged @xmath35 to about 0.01% . for the step size ( cf .",

    "the wannier function basis can be viewed as an orthogonal tight - binding basis .",
    "for this reason it is useful to calculate one - particle matrix elements of the hamiltonian in the wannier basis .",

    "( [ eq : tenk ] ) can be directly calculated from the band structure @xmath71 .",
    "a gauge transformation of the second kind leads to states @xmath72 that are no longer eigenstates of @xmath69 with eigenvalue @xmath71",
    ". therefore @xmath70 are not invariant under a gauge transformation of the second kind",
    ". however , generally we can always calculate @xmath73 and use its diagonalized eigenvalues as the band structure for any set of wannier functions .",

    "( [ eq : trnm ] ) , i.e. , using wannier functions , we can use eqs .",
    "( [ eq : asa ] ) and ( [ eq : wtrs ] ) to find @xmath75 where the integral is over a single sphere only .",
    "the effect of @xmath69 on the second wave function can be carried out easily because we are working in a linear basis .",

    "<S> two methods for calculating coulomb matrix elements from wannier functions are presented and applied to fcc cu . for the unscreened on - site hubbard @xmath0 for the cu 3d - bands we have obtained about 25ev . </S>",
    "<S> these results are also compared with results obtained from a constrained local - density approximation ( lda ) calculation . </S>"
