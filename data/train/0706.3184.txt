    "the tilted models have shown a wide variety of phenomena including , for example , the existence of closed curves @xcite and incompleteness of the fluid congruence @xcite .",
    "the general irrotational perfect fluid type vi@xmath0 model is the most general of the irrotational bianchi models .",
    "in fact , the irrotational type vi@xmath0 model has a 6-dimensional state space ; just one dimension less than that of of the most general tilted type vi@xmath0 model .",

    "the exceptional feature of this model does not relate to the group itself ( for which there is nothing extraordinary ) but arises from the einstein field equations . for this particular model one of the einstein constraint equations vanishes exactly and hence the vacuum case allows for an extra shear degree of freedom .",
    "this extra shear is present in the collinson - french vacuum solution and therefore this metric has no analogue in the other bianchi vacuum cosmologies .",
    "the aim of this paper is to fill one of the gaps in the analysis of the general tilted type vi@xmath9 models presented in @xcite .",
