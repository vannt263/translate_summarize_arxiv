    "neutron stars are believed to be born in the aftermath of core - collapse supernova explosions as the stellar remnant becomes gravitationally decoupled from the stellar ejecta .",
    "two interesting and timely question are : ( 1 ) do neutron stars spin at millisecond periods at birth or do they spin closer to the observed periods of young pulsars ? ; ( 2 ) do they emit gravitational radiation that is detectable by interferometers on earth ? theoretically , conservation of angular momentum in the core collapse of a @xmath5 progenitor can lead to a newborn neutron star with a period of @xmath6 ms or shorter .",
    "observationally , the fastest known young pulsar is in the large magellanic cloud supernova remnant n157b , and has a rotation period of 16 ms @xcite .",
    "the crab pulsar is the next fastest neutron star in a supernova remnant with an age @xmath7 yr .",
    "its current rotation period is 33 ms .",
    "its initial period is estimated to be @xmath8 ms @xcite by assuming the rotational spin - down is well described by a power law @xmath9 with braking index @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "one way to predict the distribution of initial pulsar periods is through population synthesis studies .",
    "these studies generally use present day observations with some assumption of their time evolution to reconstruct the birth distribution periods and magnetic fields of the pulsar population .",
    "current studies favor initial periods in the range of several tens to several hundreds of milliseconds @xcite .",
    "the apparent discrepancy between the theoretically possible fast rotation rates and the observed slow rotation rates of young neutron stars could be reconciled if the r - mode instability or some other mechanism could spin neutron stars down efficiently , preventing them from maintaining millisecond periods .",
    "r - modes are quasi - toroidal oscillations in rotating fluids that occur because of the coriolis effect .",
    "these modes are driven unstable by gravitational radiation reaction via the chandrasekhar - friedman - schutz ( cfs ) mechanism @xcite . in the absence of fluid dissipation",
    ", the cfs mechanism causes any mode that is retrograde in the co - rotating frame , but prograde in the inertial frame , to grow as gravitational radiation is emitted @xcite .",
    "the most unstable r - mode is the @xmath11 mode , called the r - mode throughout the rest of the paper ( here @xmath12 and @xmath13 label the degree and order of the legendre functions associated with the mode . )",
    "the gravitational driving equals viscous dissipation for this mode along a critical curve in the angular velocity - temperature ( @xmath14 ) phase space . above the critical curve",
    "the r - mode is linearly unstable and the r - mode amplitude grows exponentially .",
    "once the r - mode amplitude passes its first parametric instability threshold , other near - resonant inertial modes are excited via energy transfer from the r - mode . at this point",
    "nonlinear effects become important .",
    "the parametric instability threshold amplitude depends on internal neutron star physics and changes with angular velocity and temperature .",
    "the first investigation that modeled the spin - down of a young neutron star due to the r - mode instability was performed by lindblom _",
    "et al .  _",
    "@xcite ( see also owen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for a more detailed analysis . )",
    "they used a simple one - mode evolution model that assumes the r - mode amplitude saturates because of nonlinear effects at some arbitrarily fixed value .",
    "the saturation amplitude was chosen to be of order 1 . in this model ,",
    "once the instability is saturated , the star spins down at fixed r - mode amplitude .",
    "et al .  _",
    "estimated that a newborn neutron star would cool to approximately @xmath15 k and spin down from a frequency close to the kepler frequency to about 100 hz in @xmath1 1 yr . in their calculation they included the effects of shear viscosity and bulk viscosity for ordinary neutron star matter composed of neutrons , protons and electrons and assumed modified urca cooling .",
    "jones @xcite and lindblom & owen @xcite pointed out that if the star contains exotic particles such as hyperons , internal processes could lead to a very high bulk viscosity in the cores of neutron stars .",
    "they predicted that for young neutron stars this viscosity would either eliminate the instability altogether or leave a short window of instability of up to a day or so for modified urca cooling @xcite that would render the gravitational radiation undetectable .",
    "andersson , jones , and kokkotas @xcite found that , in the case of strange stars , young neutron stars can evolve along the r - mode stability curve reaching a quasi - adiabatic equilibrium at low r - mode amplitudes .",
    "similar conclusions were reached by reisenegger & bonacic @xcite for large hyperon bulk viscosity .",
    "we include nonlinear effects and find that the spectrum of possible evolutions is more diverse .",
    "quasi - equilibrium evolutions along the r - mode stability curve are just one scenario .",
    "schenk _ et al .  _",
    "@xcite developed a formalism to study nonlinear interactions of the r - mode with other inertial modes .",
    "they assumed a small r - mode amplitude and treated the oscillations of the modes with weakly nonlinear perturbation theory via three - mode couplings .",
    "this assumption was tested by arras _",
    "et al .  _",
    "@xcite and brink _ et al .",
    "proposed that a turbulent cascade will develop in the strong driving regime .",
    "they estimated that the r - mode amplitude was small and could have values between @xmath16 .",
    "_ computed the interactions of about 5000 modes via approximately @xmath17 couplings among modes with @xmath18 .",
    "they modeled the star as incompressible and calculated the coupling coefficients analytically .",
    "the couplings were restricted to near resonant modes with a fractional detuning of @xmath19 .",
    "_ showed that the nonlinear evolution saturates at amplitudes comparable with the lowest parametric instability threshold .",
    "they did not include spin or temperature evolution in their calculation .    in a previous paper @xcite we investigated the nonlinear saturation of the r - mode instability for neutron stars in lmxbs and included temperature and spin evolution . in this paper",
    "we begin a study of the nonlinear development of the r - mode instability in newborn neutron stars .",
    "we use an effective three - mode treatment in that we include one triplet of modes with a statistically relevant coupling and detuning coefficient and treat it as the lowest parametric instability threshold .",
    "the triplet consists of the @xmath20 , @xmath21 r - mode and two near - resonant inertial modes with @xmath22 and @xmath23 that couple to it .",
    "the exact inertial modes that are excited when the r - mode grows above its parametric instability threshold will change as the star spins down . however , since the nearest resonance is statistically expected to be at a detuning of @xmath24 and the mode coupling coefficient for the lowest parametric instability threshold is typically of order one  @xcite , a mode triplet using these values should provide a qualitatively correct picture .",
    "the model also includes neutrino cooling via a combination of fast and slow processes , viscous heating due to hyperon bulk viscosity and boundary layer viscosity , and spin - down due to gravitational radiation and magnetic dipole radiation . in oder to explore possible nonlinear behaviors we vary : ( 1 ) the hyperon superfluid transition temperature @xmath25 , which is believed to be @xmath26 k ; ( 2 ) the strength of the hyperon bulk viscosity ; ( 3 ) the boundary layer viscosity via the slippage factor @xmath27 that parametrizes the interaction between oscillating fluid core and the elastic crust @xcite ; and ( 4 ) the fraction of the star that cools via direct urca reactions @xmath28 .",
    "we find a variety of scenarios that depend on these parameters and on the initial r - mode amplitude .",
    "the star cools until the cooling is balanced by viscous heating .",
    "it then follows a quasi - adiabatic evolution either on the r - mode stability curve or on other cooling = heating curves on which the neutrino cooling is balanced by viscous heating from the three modes . for low hyperon bulk viscosity or when we include only slow cooling , we find runaway behavior in which the energy dissipated by the two inertial modes is not sufficient to stop the growth of the r - mode amplitude and several parametric instability thresholds are passed .",
    "modeling such behavior accurately requires the inclusion of multiple mode triplets , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the three mode problem is a natural first step in studying nonlinear effects for the r - mode instability .",
    "this model is valid as long as the r - mode amplitude does not grow above parametric instability thresholds that are higher than the lowest threshold .",
    "the thresholds are functions of the angular velocity and temperature of the star and depend on the viscous damping rates of the modes and model details .",
    "the star cools at constant angular velocity until the cooling is stopped by viscous heating and then spins down oscillating between thermal equilibrium states until the r - mode is no longer unstable .",
    "the r - mode amplitudes we find are still fairly low @xmath29 and the spin - down torque due to gravitational radiation reaction is typically lower than that due to magnetic dipole radiation .",
    "so , the spin down timescale , which is approximately the timescale on which the r - mode is unstable , is dominated by the magnetic dipole radiation timescale for @xmath30 g. our evolutions are determined by competitions between cooling and heating , gravitational driving and viscous damping , and magnetic dipole and gravitational spin - down with the competition between cooling and heating playing the most prominent role .",
    "we expect that some of this behavior will hold for more sophisticated models as well .",
    "our evolutions are determined by competitions between neutrino cooling and viscous heating , gravitational driving and viscous dissipation , neutrino cooling and gravitational driving , neutrino cooling and magnetic spin - down of the star with the competition between cooling and heating placing the most prominent role .",
    "the three - mode model is adequate as long as the mode amplitudes do not grow high enough to excite more modes in the star .",

    "our evolutions start with an initial temperature of @xmath31 k and an initial rotation rate at the kepler break - up frequency @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the average density of the star .",
    "these initial conditions place the neutron star above the r - mode stability curve in the unstable region .",
    "the evolutions are independent of the initial temperature for temperatures for which the cooling rate is faster than the gravitational driving rate .",
    "the star cools at approximately constant angular velocity until the cooling is stopped by viscous heating .",
    "once thermal equilibrium is reached , the star spins down oscillating though a series of thermal equilibrium states .",
    "the spin - down is the longest part of the evolution lasting at least several years , while the initial cooling at constant angular velocity lasts minutes to hours depending on whether low or fast cooling processes dominate .",
    "so , the timescale on which the r - mode instability is active and gravitational radiation is emitted is approximately the spin - down timescale .",
    "the spin - down part of the trajectory of the star can be approximated by a cooling = heating ( @xmath34 ) curve .",
    "this curve is not unique and is determined by equating the neutrino cooling and the viscous heating using quasi - stationary amplitude solutions ( eqs .",

    "our schematic hyperon bulk viscosity model corresponds to an r - mode stability curve with one maximum ( see fig .  [ schematic ] ) .",
    "we find three possible @xmath34 curves : one on each side of the maximum , and one that is on the r - mode stability curve , where gravitational driving equals viscous dissipation .",
    "the latter corresponds to evolutions for which a one - mode model is adequate and the former two @xmath34 curves approximate triplet evolutions .",
    "the trajectory that the star follows depends on whether the r - mode amplitude passes its parametric instability threshold before the r - mode stability curve or afterwards .",
    "if the parametric instability threshold is reached first , the star will spin down on the @xmath34 near the high t side ( @xmath35 ) of the r - mode stability curve ( * type i * evolution ) . in this scenario , the viscous heating due to all three modes balances the cooling .",
    "if the r - mode stability curve is reached first , the star can spin down following the r - mode stability curve ( * type ii * evolution ) or , for lower initial r - mode amplitude , cool through that thermal equilibrium region and spin down on the @xmath34 near the low @xmath36 side ( @xmath37 ) of the r - mode stability curve ( * type iii * evolution ) . as the star spins down and cools slowly",

    "when this happens the star cools to the next closest thermal equilibrium region leading to mixed * type i - ii * ( see fig .  [ a1 ] for an example . ) and * type ii - iii * ( see fig .  [ tch12 ] . ) evolutions .",
    "the quasi - stationary solutions are independent of initial conditions .",
    "evolutions in which the three modes are sufficient to model the behavior follow trajectories that oscillate around @xmath34 curves .",
    "so , they are roughly independent of initial conditions as well",
    ". however , the initial r - mode amplitude can determine which type of evolution will occur . at a given viscosity ,",
    "cooling and initial spin - frequency , for initial r - mode amplitudes above a certain @xmath38 the r - mode amplitude will always reach parametric instability before the stability curve and hence a type i evolution will occur . and",
    "below this value type ii evolutions will occur . a similar amplitude threshold exists between type ii and type iii evolutions .",
    "if no thermal equilibrium can be reached , the r - mode amplitude grows above several parametric instability thresholds and excites more inertial modes . in order to accurately model runaway behavior",
    "more mode triplets need to be included .",
    "this is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we obtain runaway scenarios by either lowering the hyperon bulk viscosity or by turning off the fast neutrino cooling .",
    "so , for low mass neutron stars that have lower central densities and no hyperon population , multiple triplets of modes are required to model the nonlinear behavior accurately .",
