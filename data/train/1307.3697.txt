    "the weyl semimetal is a new class of three - dimensional ( 3d ) dirac materials in which gapless dirac excitations form at the linear contact of two nondegenerate bands at points or lines , and disperse in all spatial dimensions.@xcite these weyl points or nodes are essentially a product of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) dirac point split by either time - reversal ( @xmath3)@xcite or inversion ( @xmath4)@xcite symmetry breaking ; yet they remain topologically protected owing to other invariant symmetry(s ) such as the space group,@xcite point group symmetry@xcite , or lattice symmetry@xcite .",
    "the topological protection of the weyl points is quantified by a vanishing net chern number ( but individually the chern number is an integer at each weyl node ) , evaluated inside a 3d berry curvature surrounding each valence weyl point .",
    "two such topologically protected weyl points of opposite chern number , separated in space by @xmath4 symmetry , act as monopoles.@xcite other interesting implications of weyl semimetals include the realization of the anomalous hall effect,@xcite nontrivial electromagnetic responses,@xcite majorana fermions,@xcite and a disconnected@xmath0yet protected@xmath0fermi surface or a so - called ` fermi arc'.@xcite furthermore , the weyl excitations are protected from impurity scattering with a shorter scattering length than the 2d dirac fermions,@xcite and thus open new avenues for potential applications and technologies .",
    "a possible material realization of weyl excitations has been put forward recently in several condensed matter systems . in a seminal work , wan _",
    "et al._@xcite have proposed that weyl nodes exist in pyrochlore iridates due to an interplay of spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) and electronic interaction .",
    "further postulates include a multilayer of a magnetically doped 3d topological insulator and a normal insulator,@xcite ferromagnetic hgcr@xmath5se@xmath6 spinel,@xcite crystalline @xmath7bi ( @xmath8na , k , rb),@xcite and @xmath9-cristobaline bio@xmath5.@xcite despite these extensive theoretical efforts , experimental confirmation of its existence is still lacking , with the exception of an indirect hint of a band touching of the valence and conducting bands at the phase transition point between a non - trivial and trivial 3d topological insulator in bitl(s@xmath10se@xmath11)@xmath5.@xcite    here we go beyond the earlier proposals , and propose that weyl nodes can also be easily stabilized by orbital symmetry in a layer - by - layer approach available within the molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) technique .",
    "we formulate two complementary design principles for this mechanism in an orbital selective layered structure with the inclusion of either soc , or a spinless @xmath1-wave superconducting ( sc ) state",
    ". the term orbital selective layer stands for a superlattice structure in which an even parity orbital layer is sandwiched in between two layers of an odd parity orbital .",
    "we find that in both cases , single or multiple weyl nodes can be engineered and planted in various locations in the momentum space by taking advantage of the flexibility brought out in a heterostrucutre geometry .",
    "we also find that a single and nondegenerate weyl point can be produced at the @xmath2-point in the sc state by breaking the particle - hole symmetry in only one of the layers in the orbital selective superlattice .",
    "we arrange the rest of the paper as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : gc ] , we layout the general concept of the orbital selective superlattice and how it can be used to stabilize the weyl node(s ) .",
    "the weyl hamiltonian based on a tight - binding model is deduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : wsoc ] using basal - plane rashba - type soc and a spontaneous magnetization .",
    "the same hamiltonian using @xmath1-pairing symmetry is derived in sec .",
    "[ sec : wsc ] and the limiting case of obtaining a non - degenerate weyl node at the @xmath2-point is discussed here .",
    "finally we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the general form of the hamiltonian can be deduced from the starting point of @xmath12 theory which takes the form of @xmath13 for the 3d case , where @xmath14 are the @xmath15 dirac matrices , and the corresponding @xmath16 vector represents a given structure .",
    "the orbital symmetry and superlattice structure can be progressively engineered together in such a way that each component @xmath17 complements its corresponding @xmath18-matrix to lead to det@xmath19\\ne0 $ ] to stabilize a protected weyl point . @xmath20 ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the pauli matrices in the orbital and spin basis , respectively ) are the projection matrices aligned in the basal plane ( say the @xmath23-@xmath24-plane ) of each layer . @xmath25 and @xmath26 can thus be interlocked via a chiral soc or chiral @xmath1-wave sc .",
    "the chirality of these states manifests into linearly dispersive dirac excitations in the basal plane . for the stability of these dirac points along the @xmath27-axis",
    ", we consider the @xmath28 term . here",
    "we propose an orbital - selective superlattice in which we take the @xmath29-orbital for the odd - parity layers , and the @xmath30-orbital on the even parity layer , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) .",
    "this setup clearly breaks the mirror ( @xmath31 ) symmetry , defined as @xmath32 , with respect to the @xmath30-mirror plane . however , to gain a time - reversal invariance of the hamiltonian , it is required to compensate for the broken @xmath31 symmetry .",
    "this we achieve by employing a spin - polarized ground state with spin polarization aligned with the mirror symmetry axis ( such as he magnetic impurity or spin - exchange term ) which violates the spin - rotational symmetry @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the complex conjugation .",
    "a byproduct of these symmetry considerations is that @xmath31 and @xmath35 commute with each other , and their product gives the time - reversal operator @xmath36 .",
    "the hamiltonian , thereby , becomes @xmath3 invariant .    for a soc locked 2d layer",
    ", we can think of a bi - film,@xcite pb / ge surface@xcite or gated silicene film@xcite on our @xmath37-layer , which is demonstrated to inherit rashba - type soc .",
    "the added benefit would be that the soc brings out the @xmath29 orbital at the fermi level in these systems which serves our purpose .",
    "for the spinless sc case , the particle - hole symmetry ( @xmath38 ) does the job for the broken @xmath35 symmetry case and the resulting hamiltonian also remains @xmath3 invariant . for such proximity induced @xmath1-wave cooper pairing on both layers",
    ", we can think of a substrate made of @xmath39he a phase,@xcite sr@xmath5ruo@xmath6,@xcite the heavy - fermion system cept@xmath40si,@xcite or an oxide interface.@xcite the additional dirac matrix @xmath41 , which usually arises in a multi - orbital framework or due to the involvement of any gap parameter , will be used as a ` tuning knob ' to manipulate the @xmath4-symmetry , and thereby to plant the weyl points at our desired locations in the 3d momentum space .",
    "based on the aforementioned design method , we write down a generalized tight - binding hamiltonian for the orbital selective superlattice with soc as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) .",
    "@xmath42 . \\ ] ] here @xmath43 is the creation ( annihilation ) fermionic operator at a lattice site @xmath44 , and @xmath45 are orbital indices .",
    "@xmath46 is the broken @xmath31 symmetry index with respect to the @xmath30-layer [ as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ] , and @xmath47 is the spin index with the easy axis aligned with that of @xmath48 .",
    "the first term is the chemical potential for different orbitals , while the second term is an intraorbital nearest neighbor hopping along all three spatial directions as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) .",
    "the intraorbital hopping integral along the superlattice growth axis , @xmath49 , is the next - nearest neighbor term in this geometry , which is usually weaker in amplitude than the in - plane ones , and easily tunable .",
    "the third term is the spin - dependent interorbital hopping , which clearly breaks the spin - rotational ( @xmath35 ) symmetry ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "however , as mentioned earlier , the @xmath35 symmetry index ( @xmath50 ) and @xmath51 @xmath31 symmetry index @xmath46 compensate each other .",
    "the last term is the soc effect , introduced by haldane@xcite and later by kane - mele,@xcite which naturally commences a nearest neighbor rashba - type interaction between the @xmath30 and @xmath37-orbitals due to an already broken @xmath31 symmetry .",
    "@xmath52 is the unit vector that connects the nearest neighbor sites between different layers.@xcite    to express the hamiltonian in the usual @xmath2-matrix form , we use a basis of four - component ` orbital - spinors ' @xmath53 of bloch states with a 3d periodic boundary condition .",
    "however , it is easy to realize that a 2d electron gas with opposite parity on adjacent layers and open boundary conditions would also lead to the same low - energy effective hamiltonian , and produce weyl nodes of the same nature .",
    "the fourier transformation of @xmath54 on a 2d square lattice gives @xmath55 , where @xmath56 where @xmath57 , with @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the energy spectrum of @xmath61 is @xmath62 .",
    "notice that along the @xmath27-axis , the nearest - neighbor interorbital hopping @xmath63 covers half of the distance that the next nearest - neighbor intra - orbital hoppings @xmath64 do , and that yields a factor of half in the former phase factor @xmath65 . for",
    "the case of preserved @xmath3 and @xmath66 symmetries , each band is doubly degenerate , and the weyl points can be planted at the locus of @xmath67 in the 3d space . clearly",
    "the mechanism of gapless weyl nodes does not rely on other parameters .",
    "the flexibility of this design principle allows us to obtain a single weyl node at the @xmath68 point for a tunable chemical potential of @xmath69 .",
    "it is noteworthy that the difference @xmath70 is the most important tuning factor to close the gap at any momentum point(s ) or lines , while the @xmath71 combination merely elevates the weyl node to the fermi level .",
    "sample results are shown for a simplified and realistic parameter choice : @xmath72 in units of @xmath73ev . the corresponding band dispersion in the 2d planes at @xmath74 and",
    "@xmath75 cuts are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig2](a ) and [ fig2](b ) , with a colormap representing the spin polarization @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively .",
    "the weyl fermion velocity on the basal plane is determined by the soc strength @xmath78 , while that along the superlattice growth axis is controlled by the hopping @xmath79 term .",
    "the density of states for the 3d weyl state is quadratic in energy around the fermi level , despite the presence of linear dispersion .",
    "the anomalous hall effect ( ahe ) has been proposed to exist in the weyl semimetal under pressure,@xcite or the @xmath3-symmetry breaking.@xcite for our geometry , an additional ` knob ' for generating ahe emanates from an externally triggered spatial potential with respect to the @xmath30-layer . to see this",
    ", we use the generalized formula for the chern number in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions in terms of the green s functions as@xcite @xmath80,\\ ] ] where @xmath81 is the levi - civita symbol which runs over 3d spatial and energy dimensions .",
    "the cutoff scale @xmath82 restricts the integration range to the linear dispersion region , where the green s function can be defined as @xmath83 , with the components of the @xmath84 vector being the linear expansion of eq .",
    "( [ e : hk ] ) .",
    "the @xmath85-symmetry invariance of each orbital plane manifests into a vanishing net chern number at any @xmath86 cut .",
    "a finite value of @xmath87 can be easily governed in our setup by playing with the @xmath88 term .",
    "this can be done by introducing a spatial gradient field or spontaneous magnetization along the @xmath27 axis .",
    "for such a case , the above formula converges to a total basal plane ahe @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the hopping anisotropy induced by the spatial gradient with respect to its mean value @xmath91 , and @xmath92 is any associated ` spontaneous ' magnetization .",
    "an interesting property known in different contexts is that the resultant electric polarization @xmath93 for such a case couples nonlinearly to the external electromagnetic field combination @xmath94 , and thereby may render non - trivial properties such as charge fractionalization or a magnetoelectric effect.@xcite      the heterostructure geometry also brings out an opportunity to plant the weyl nodes at desired points or lines , by lifting the @xmath4 symmetry in @xmath95 term .",
    "some representative examples are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig2](c)-[fig2](e ) . by switching off the intra - orbitals hopping along the heterostructure growth axis ,",
    "i.e. @xmath96 , we obtain an odd number of weyl points at the high - symmetry momenta @xmath97=(0,0,@xmath981 ) , in addition to one at the @xmath99 point ; see fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) . again , for @xmath100 , one can engineer weyl nodes at @xmath97=(@xmath981,0,0 ) , ( 0,@xmath981,0 ) , and its equivalent points@xmath0an even number of weyl nodes in total@xmath0as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](d ) .",
    "furthermore , by extending the electron overlap integrals to the next nearest - neighbor hopping , which yields @xmath101 , we can plant the weyl points at @xmath97=(0,0,0 ) and ( @xmath981,@xmath981,0 ) , ( 0,@xmath981,@xmath981 ) , and at @xmath102 momenta for @xmath103 [ fig .",
    "[ fig2](e ) ] .",
    "this vast tunability clearly makes our proposal exciting and applicable for the realization of many nontrivial properties by manipulating a suitable net chern number in various configurations .",
    "the analogy between a spinless @xmath1-pairing symmetry and 2d dirac node due to the dual effect of linear - dispersion and definitive chirality is well explored in the literature in different contexts.@xcite we exploit a proximity induced @xmath1-wave sc between two orbital - selective layers to generate 3d weyl nodes which are also the pairing nodes .",
    "an advantage of a sc triggered weyl node is that the accompanying particle - hole symmetry @xmath38 replaces the spin - rotational symmetry breaking of the former setup . in this case",
    "the bogoliubov - de - gennes ( bdg ) fermions transform as @xmath104 as opposed to @xmath105 for the spin - rotation .",
    "@xmath38 symmetry complements the @xmath31 symmetry breaking to preserve the @xmath3 symmetry , as in the previous case . to express the bdg hamiltonian in the same form as eq .",
    "( [ e : hk ] ) , we shuffle the nambu operators for the two - orbital model to choose a basis as @xmath106 to obtain @xmath107 the hamiltonian implies a sc chiral identity between two orbital selective layers as @xmath108 where @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the amplitude of sc gap .",
    "the eigenvalues of eq .",
    "( [ hsc ] ) come out to be same as that of eq .",
    "( [ e : hk ] ) , and thus the resulting band dispersion appears to be same as in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for @xmath111 with a single weyl node at the @xmath2 point . here",
    "the weyl node and sc node coincide on the basal plane , however , they can be split by tuning parameters as before .",
    "interestingly , with suitable parameter choices , one can also engineer a line sc node ( ` fermi arc ' ) at the locus of @xmath112 with various interesting sc properties known to exist for line nodes.@xcite evidence and proposals of a chiral @xmath37 wave are in abundance in condensed matter systems.@xcite therefore , a proximity induced counter helical sc in adjacent layers is conceivable .",
    "elimination of the degeneracy of the weyl nodes can be achieved for the sc case , by lifting the particle - hole symmetry",
    "@xmath38 only in one orbital , say the @xmath37 orbital , while it remains preserved in the @xmath30 layer .",
    "this can be performed by changing the chemical potential @xmath113 . as a result ,",
    "the corresponding band becomes inverted and gapped from the nodal region , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig3](a ) and [ fig3](b ) for @xmath74 and @xmath75 cuts , respectively .",
    "this allows us to achieve a long - sought single helical 3d nodal point at the @xmath2 momentum , which has been obtained earlier in other classes of topological systems , but not in weyl semimetals .",
    "an important consequence of one helical band at the fermi energy is the emergence of a majorana bound state ( mbs ) which can be achieved here by adding a zeeman term , and tuning the chemical potential @xmath114 to plant the mbs at the zero - bias conductance peak .",
    "the stability of a mbs in a proximity induced topological sc ( not in a weyl sc ) is studied in ref .  .",
    "we propose two complementary design methods for designing 3d weyl nodal points in an orbital - selective superlattice with the inclusion of either soc or a spinless @xmath1-wave sc .",
    "the orbital - selective multilayer can be generated by using suitable materials which host opposite orbital symmetries in the low - energy spectrum and at low - dimensions .",
    "rashba - type soc@xcite and chiral @xmath37-wave scs@xcite are readily available in nature .",
    "the vast tunability of the parameters offers a desired tool to manipulate the location of weyl nodes , as well as to obtain a single - helical weyl band .",
    "instead of using only @xmath30 and @xmath37 orbitals for the even- and odd parity layers , one can also think of using @xmath84 and @xmath115 orbitals , respectively , which will accompany electronic correlations .",
    "an electron correlation can be a curse for the stability of weyl points , however , it can also be a blessing for incorporating several many - body non - trivial phenomena within the weyl matrix .",
    "for example , it has been shown earlier that in the 5@xmath115 electron uru@xmath5si@xmath5 , the fermi surface nesting renders the main band and the shadow bands to touch at the fermi level ( but not at the @xmath2 point ) with dirac - like dispersions,@xcite which resembles the so - called ` accidental degenerate points',@xcite which we call now weyl points.@xcite    given the symmetry of the hamiltonian deduced here and the opposite parity of the wavefunction in different layers at the topological critical point , i.e. , at the weyl point , strain or other time - reversal invariant perturbations can open an inverted band gap , and the system can be driven from a trivial to nontrivial topological phase . in that case",
    "the situation will be analogous to the one proposed earlier in a heterostructure containing an opposite rashba - type soc in the adjacent layers.@xcite    in addition to being a noval proposal with possible enhanced tunability for a single or multiple number of weyl nodes , the present proposal has several advantages : ( 1 ) it gives us an opportunity to obtain a single helical weyl excitation at the @xmath2 point .",
    "( 2 ) it is easy to tune the net chern number for the entire momentum space , and thus ahe . ( 3 ) the coexistence of weyl and sc nodes , and line sc nodes , instead of a fully gapped topological superconductor can be explored here .",
    "( 4 ) incorporation of an electron - electron interaction via orbital choices or changing thickness of layers,@xcite is possible .",
    "these functional properties can influence the detection and controlled tuning of many non - abelian topological properties , and electromagnetic responses of our recent interests for conceptual novelties and technologies .",
    "( 5 ) most importantly , the present proposal is free from any crystal geometry restriction , and all symmetry properties and tight - binding parameters for the stabilization of 3d dirac excitations can be manipulated externally in the heterostructure geometry .",
