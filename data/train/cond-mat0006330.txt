    "( [ osmo2 ] ) should reasonably approximate the osmotic pressure .",

    "the bulk modulus ( or inverse compressibility ) , defined by @xmath186 , may be similarly expressed in the form @xmath187 , where @xmath188 and @xmath189 are the macroion and microion contributions , respectively . from eq .",

    "( [ osmo2 ] ) and ( [ bulkm ] ) , the macroion contributions , @xmath177 and @xmath188 , are understood to be obtained from a theory ( or simulation ) of a one - component system of particles interacting via the effective pair potential [ eqs .",

    "the macroion charge , notoriously difficult to extract from experiment , is usually replaced by an adjustable parameter , the effective or renormalized charge , @xmath191  @xcite .    as a test of our results ,",

    "et al_.  @xcite for a colloidal fcc crystal in a highly deionized ( @xmath192 ) aqueous solvent at room temperature ( bjerrum length @xmath193 nm ) . as an approximation for the macroion pressure , @xmath177 , we use results of integral - equation calculations based on the virial equation with hnc closure for the liquid - state pair distribution function  @xcite . for the effective macroion charge",

    "@xcite .",
    "the microion contribution is seen to make the dominant contribution to the total osmotic pressure and to substantially improve the agreement between the one - component model and experiment , particularly at lower volume fractions ( @xmath195 ) .",
    "the last term in eq .",
    "( [ osmo2 ] ) clearly is essential to reduce the rapidly increasing counterion ideal - gas pressure .",
    "the discrepancies at higher volume fractions ( @xmath196 ) might be attributed , at least partially , to an underestimate of @xmath177 by the liquid - state theory .",
    "they may also reflect nonlinear response of the counterions and associated effective many - body interactions between pseudo - macroions .",
    "future work will address influences of effective triplet interactions on the osmotic pressure  @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned that the poisson - boltzmann cell model  @xcite ( upper curve in fig .",
    "1 ) matches the experimental data well , especially at higher @xmath197 .",
    "however , while cell models , which consider the distribution of microions within a wigner - seitz cell centered on a single macroion , are limited to periodic crystals , the more general one - component model applies to any thermodynamic phase .",
    "a more stringent test of the theory is presented by the bulk modulus  the curvature , with respect to density , of the free energy density . in recent experiments ,",
    "et al_.  @xcite determined the bulk modulus of colloidal fcc crystals suspended in a deionized , aqueous solvent at room temperature ( @xmath198 nm ) by measuring the long - wavelength limit of the static structure factor . for two samples , distinguished by nearest - neighbor distances , @xmath199 @xmath99 m and @xmath200 @xmath99 m",
    ", the measured bulk moduli were argued to be lower than the predictions of dlvo theory , as estimated on the basis of an approximate elastic theory for the macroion contribution , @xmath188 . for the denser crystal ,",
    "the measured value was @xmath201 pa , less than a third of the estimated  dlvo \" value of @xmath202 pa .",
    "this analysis ignores , however , the counterion contribution associated with the volume energy .",

    "these results demonstrate that for sufficiently high effective macroion charge and volume fraction the counterion contribution may become _",

    "the cross - over point at @xmath203 may be compared with the effective charges , @xmath204 for @xmath205 @xmath99 m and @xmath206 for @xmath207 @xmath99 m , estimated by weiss _",

    "however , lacking reliable knowledge of @xmath191 in the crystal phase , we forgo here a more quantitative analysis .",

    "in summary , by reducing a model colloidal suspension of charged hard - sphere macroions and point microions to an equivalent one - component system , and approximating the microion response to the macroion charge using linear response ( second - order perturbation ) theory , we have derived an effective electrostatic pair interaction [ eq .",
    "( [ veffr2 ] ) ] and an associated microion volume energy [ eq .",
    "( [ eo2 ] ) ] .",
    "the volume energy , which depends on the average macroion density , accounts for both the microion entropy and the macroion - microion interaction energy . the effective interaction , which governs the dynamics of the macroions , is of precisely the conventional dlvo form for finite - sized macroions , but incorporates excluded volume corrections through the dependence of the screening constant on the _ effective _ density of microions in the free volume between macroion cores .",
    "the total free energy of the system is the sum of the volume energy and the free energy of the equivalent one - component system of pseudo - macroions . from the free energy",
    ", we have derived simple analytic expressions for the osmotic pressure and bulk modulus .",
    "comparison of theoretical predictions with experimental data for deionized suspensions of highly charged macroions shows that the microions can significantly contribute to the thermodynamic properties , beyond their role in screening the bare coulomb interaction between macroions . in particular",
    ", the volume energy largely accounts for the observed magnitude of the osmotic pressure and qualitatively explains measurements of bulk modulus lower than predicted by the conventional one - component dlvo theory .",
    "several recent studies have predicted similar influences of volume energies on the phase behavior of charged colloids  @xcite .",
    "the theory presented here can be straightforwardly generalized to include _ nonlinear _ response of microions  @xcite and thereby used to assess the relative importance of effective _ many - body _",
    "interactions  @xcite and associated corrections to the effective pair potential and the volume energy .",
    "related applications are to colloid - surface interactions and to interactions between colloids in the vicinity of a surface , which experiment  @xcite and theory  @xcite suggest may become attractive .",
