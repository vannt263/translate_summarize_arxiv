    "muonium is a hydrogenlike system of an electron ( @xmath3 ) bound to a positive muon ( @xmath4 ) and antimuonium is the bound state of the respective antiparticles ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "it is formed as muons stop inside matter , although the fraction of stopped muons that actually form muonium depends very much on the material itself .",
    "since it has no hadronic constituents , muonium is an ideal place to test electroweak interactions . in particular , since conversion of muonium into antimuonium is completely forbidden within the standard model ( sm ) because it violates lepton flavor , its observation will be a clear signal of physics beyond the sm .",
    "this phenomenon was first suggested almost 50 years ago @xcite and since then several studies @xcite and experimental searches @xcite have been done .",
    "many extensions of the sm could cause muonium to antimuonium conversion @xcite ( left - right symmetric gauge models , extra neutrinos , extra higgses , susy , bileptonic gauge bosons , etc ) .    here",
    "we want to study the possibility that heavy majorana neutrinos in models of seesaw type could cause an observable signal of muonium - antimuonium conversion . in previous works",
    "we have studied the prospects for these models to generate tau decays that violate lepton flavor @xcite .",
    "the main feature of these models is that they only extend the standard model by the existence of extra neutral leptons .",
    "the most natural scenario is then that lepton families will mix ( thus destroying lepton flavor conservation ) and that neutrinos will acquire masses . in order to insure that the standard neutrinos remain light",
    ", the texture of the neutrino mass matrix should favor a seesaw type of mechanism . in these models ,",
    "muonium to antimuonium conversion appears at one loop level in the perturbative expansion ( box diagrams see figs .  1 and 2 ) and it is thus a very small effect .",
    "a simple estimate of this conversion probability within the models in question shows that it is too small to be observed in foreseeable experiments @xcite .",
    "another work along these lines @xcite , making a rough estimate shows that present experimental bounds set a lower bound on large majorana masses at around @xmath6 tev .",
    "however , we find that the validity of the calculation ( perturbation theory to one loop ) breaks down for masses above that same scale . therefore one can make clear predictions for masses up to that scale only .",
    "we analyze the process in more detail within the one - loop approximation , performing a comprehensive search for the bounds in the currently allowed parameter space .",
    "we confirm the conclusion that seesaw models give a conversion probability that is still too small to be at the reach of experiments to date .",
    "we also find that typical seesaw models of heavy neutrinos are in most cases totally out of reach of any foreseeable experiment , except in very special , fine - tuned regions of the parameter space .",
    "in contrast , models with heavy neutrinos that conserve lepton number give conversion probabilities closer to present experimental sensitivities for natural values of parameters .",
    "in section ii we give the generalities of muonium - antimuonium conversion ; in section iii we calculate the process within the models in question and do a comprehensive search of the presently allowed parameter space , looking for the maximal possible conversion probabilities . in section",

    "muonium @xmath8 is a nonrelativistic coulombic bound state of @xmath4 and @xmath3 , and antimuonium @xmath9 a similar bound state of @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the nontrivial mixing between @xmath12 and @xmath9 comes in our context from the non - vanishing lfv transition amplitude for @xmath13 . in a model with heavy neutrinos",
    ", this amplitude appears at one loop ( box diagrams ) in the electroweak interaction extended with extra ( heavy ) neutrinos .",
    "this transition is usually expressed in terms of a local effective hamiltonian density with an effective coupling @xmath1 : @xmath14 \\left [ { \\overline \\mu}(x ) \\gamma_{\\alpha } ( 1\\!-\\!\\gamma_5 ) e(x ) \\right ] \\ . \\label{leff}\\ ] ]    due to this interaction , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are not mass eigenstates . in this basis , the mass matrix has non - diagonal components : @xmath17 where the ( non - relativistic ) bound states are chosen with unit norm in a volume @xmath18 , namely @xmath19 @xmath20 .",
    "if we express the bound state in terms of its constituents with a momentum distribution @xmath21 : @xmath22 and neglect the momentum dependence in the spinors , the mass mixing element is : @xmath23 since angular momentum is conserved , the only non vanishing elements are those where the spin of the initial and final bound state are the same . for both the singlet or each of the triplet components , the spinor product has the same value @xmath24 @xcite . additionally , the integral of @xmath21 is the spatial wavefunction at zero distance , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the muonium reduced mass and @xmath27 the fine structure constant . in vacuum , the diagonal mass terms are equal , @xmath28 .",
    "the mass eigenstates are then the simple combinations @xmath29 and @xmath30 and the mass eigenvalues differ in @xmath31 @xmath32 . this is the typical case of a quantum system of two states that oscillate into each other under time evolution , like the @xmath33 system in hadrons",
    "however , unlike the latter , in practical terms muonia do not have time to show an oscillation , because their oscillation time is much longer than their decay time .",
    "so one can only hope to observe the mixing phenomenon by measuring the probability that a state that starts as a muonium ( @xmath34 ) decays as an antimuonium ( decay into a high energy electron and low energy positron ) .",

    "the details of the models are given in appendix a. the main features of these models are that ( i ) they contain heavy neutrinos , ( ii ) in their mass basis , the heavy neutrinos couple to charged leptons of different generations under weak interactions ( just like the cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa prescription in the quark sector ) , thus inducing flavor changing processes ( iii ) in general the neutrino masses are of majorana type .",

    "it is important to remark that this global sign can not be changed by simple redefinition of fermion phases .",

    "if the neutrino masses are very large , the mixings will be forced to be considerably smaller than their current upper bound , and so assuming larger masses may not help to get potentially larger conversion probabilities .",

    "here we do it by finding the relation between the neutrino masses and the mixings , following the whole process of mass matrix diagonalization from the start within each model . keeping these consistency conditions , we search for the largest possible values for @xmath80 in the scenarios of models i and ii .",

    "we have looked for the maximum probabilities of muonium to antimuonium conversion that can be reached in models where the required lepton flavor violation is caused by heavy neutrinos , keeping consistency with all present bounds .",
    "the estimates are done within two alternative models . in both models the amplitudes are in general growing functions of the heavy neutrino masses .",
    "our estimates of the amplitudes are thus limited by two effects : ( i ) suppression of flavor mixing matrix elements as the masses get larger and ( ii ) the breakdown of perturbative expansion for masses above a few tens of tev .",
    "model i includes extra right handed neutrino singlets and constitutes a typical seesaw model for the neutrino masses and mixings , which violates lepton flavor as well as lepton number .",
    "model ii includes extra right handed and left handed neutrino singlets in such a way that lepton flavor is violated , yet lepton number is conserved .",
    "we found that in model i the majorana boxes give the dominant contribution over the dirac boxes in the most typical scenarios , yet the maximum probabilities are obtained in finely tuned regions of the parameter space , where dirac and majorana boxes are comparable and even tend to interfere destructively . as a consequence of this effect , the maximal conversion rates are not as large as one could have navely estimated .",
    "the maximal couplings thus obtained are @xmath202 , which means conversion probabilities 4 orders of magnitude below present experimental sensitivities .",
    "moreover , away from the finely tuned condition , the small masses of the light neutrinos enforce a dramatic suppression of the mixing ( a typical seesaw behavior ) and the probabilities drop by several orders of magnitude to unreachable levels .",
    "model ii , in contrast , requires no finely tuned condition to reach its maximal amplitudes . in this case , because of lepton number conservation , the heavy majorana neutrinos come in degenerate pairs , thus acting effectively as dirac neutrinos . as a result ,",
