    "the inflationary paradigm provides an appealing framework to describe the very early phase of the evolution of the universe , notably because it produces in a natural way the seeds necessary to the formation of the cosmological large scale structures  @xcite .",
    "these initial density fluctuations are generated during inflation with an almost scale invariant power spectrum through the parametric amplification of the quantum fluctuations of the inflaton scalar field , with the accelerated friedman - lematre scale factor acting as a classical pump field .",
    "this can also be seen as particle production due to the breakdown of adiabaticity in the evolution of the quantum modes of the field as the wavelengths are stretched beyond the horizon .    in spite of their successes , most models of inflation are subject to the _ trans - planckian problem _ , namely the phase of accelerated expansion lasts sufficiently long that cosmological length scales today corresponded to scales much smaller than the planck scale at the beginning of inflation  @xcite . depending on one s point of view ,",
    "this can be seen either as a problem , i.e. the celebrated predictions depend on unknown trans - planckian physics , or as a blessing , since inflation then opens a window on physics beyond the planck scale .",
    "several studies have recently tackled the issue of the robustness of inflation to changes in super - planck physics by adopting a phenomenological approach initially developed in the context of black hole physics , where a very similar problem arises  @xcite , and in close relation to analogous problems in condensed matter physics  @xcite .",
    "it consists in modifying the standard dispersion relation of a free scalar field for wavelengths smaller than the planck length and in calculating the resulting power spectrum of inflation produced metric fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "this approach is further motivated by the fact that the evolution of the scalar and tensor modes of metric fluctuations can be adequately described by free scalar fields propagating in a background spacetime  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that this is only a phenomenological approach to the problem of trans - planckian physics , and that it is not unique .",
    "for instance , modifications of the canonical quantum operator commutation relations inspired from string theories  @xcite have also been shown to affect the power spectrum of metric fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , concrete examples of dispersion relations leading to modifications of the power spectrum with respect to the standard ( linear dispersion relation ) predictions have been exhibited  @xcite but only in the case where the dispersion relation becomes complex .",
    "even though complex dispersion relations are ordinary in classical physics or in quantum mechanics , they represent a problematic situation in the context of quantum field theory .",
    "it has also been shown that dispersion relations such that the evolution of the quantum mode is adiabatic all throughout the inflationary phase up to horizon crossing can not lead to significant modifications of the power spectrum  @xcite . with respect to the above example of dispersion relations , indeed adiabaticity is broken at the point where the physical frequency vanishes and the dispersion relation becomes complex .",
    "however it has been argued that such dispersion relations which break adiabaticity would lead to a possibly severe backreaction problem , i.e. the energy density contained in the modes would become greater than the background energy density  @xcite",
    ". therefore modifications to the power spectrum may arise if adiabaticity is broken , but at the expense of the creation of a possibly large amount of energy density .",
    "unfortunately this amount could not be quantified rigorously as the authors did not have at their disposal the stress - energy tensor of a theory with modified dispersion relation .    in this context ,",
    "our main objective is to present a rigorous derivation of the stress - energy tensor of a free scalar field with non - linear dispersion relation .",
    "such a dispersion relation breaks local lorentz invariance as it implies the existence of a preferred reference frame , however it is crucial to maintain general covariance in order to achieve consistency with the einstein equations ( and notably the conservation of the stress - energy tensor ) .",
    "this problem has been examined in a number of studies , where an effective general covariant lagrangian with explicit lorentz invariance breaking has been constructed with the introduction of a dynamical unit timelike vector field whose role is to define the preferred rest frame  @xcite .",
    "an effective lagrangian describing a free scalar theory with a quartic dispersion relation could then be constructed along these lines , and the stress - energy tensor has been calculated for the particular case of the corley - jacobson dispersion relation  @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we present a non - trivial extension of this latter study to the general case in which the squared frequency is a general analytic function of the squared momentum .",
    "note that in friedman - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) cosmology , a preferred rest frame exists and coincides with the homogeneous isotropic spatial sections .",
    "finally one should point out that the method given below can not be used to derive the stress - energy tensor for theories with unmodified dispersion relations but modified canonical commutation relations as considered in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we then use this stress - energy tensor to address two points raised recently in the literature .",
    "we first discuss the claim  @xcite according to which a bath of gravitons of super - planck momenta but frequencies much smaller than the hubble expansion rate ( hence a particular non - linear dispersion relation ) , can explain the form of vacuum energy seen in the universe today . in order to do so",
    ", we calculate the energy density , the pressure and the equation of state of these quanta ; we show that these gravitons possess neither the correct energy density nor the correct equation of state . as a second application we discuss the issue of backreaction of trans - planckian modes in inflationary cosmology , using the expression for the energy density contained in trans - planckian modes .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section  [ sec_2 ]",
    "we formulate a covariant lagrangian (   [ sec_2a ] ) including extra terms to provide a modified dispersion relations and calculate the corresponding stress - energy tensor (   [ sec_3 ] ) .",
    "then , we specify our result to the case of cosmology (   [ sec_2c ] ) .",
    "section  [ sec_4 ] discusses the two main applications of our results , namely the equation of state of the trans - planckian modes (   [ subsec_4.1 ] ) and the backreaction problem (   [ subsec_4.2 ] and   [ subsec_4.3 ] ) .",
    "our results are summarized in section  [ sec_concl ] . for the sake of clarity , we gathered notations and derivations of various identities used in the calculation of the stress - energy tensor in appendix  [ appa ] ; appendix  [ app_b ] presents the detailed derivation of the stress - energy tensor in the simpler case of the corley - jacobson dispersion relation .",
    "we use natural units in which @xmath0 , and the metric @xmath1 carries signature @xmath2 .",
    "in this section , we first introduce a general covariant formulation of a lagrangian describing a free scalar field with modified dispersion relation following the procedure described by jacobson and mattingly  @xcite , and derive the corresponding energy - momentum tensor .",

    "the overall lagrangian maintains general covariance , which will notably ensure the conservation of the stress - energy tensor .",
    "the value of the lagrange multiplier @xmath16 can be obtained by the extremization of the action with respect to the vector field @xmath10 .",

    "liddle and lyth  @xcite ( in collaboration with e.  stewart ) pointed out that if the modes of comoving wavelength of order of the horizon size , i.e. modes of cosmological interest for structure formation , start in a non - vacuum initial state , then inflation suffers from a very important backreaction problem .",
    "it is interesting for the following discussion to summarize briefly their argument .",
    "a mode with momentum @xmath142 exits the horizon @xmath185 @xmath186-folds before the end of inflation  @xcite . at horizon",
    "crossing , this mode carries a physical momentum @xmath187 , @xmath188gev being the hubble scale during inflation .",
    "therefore , this mode had a physical momentum @xmath189 at the onset of inflation , @xmath190 being the number of @xmath186-folds of inflation before horizon crossing , and @xmath191 the total number of @xmath186-folds of inflation .",
    "there is no reason to expect that inflation lasted just sufficiently long so as to stretch beyond the horizon only those modes with wavelength smaller than the horizon size today , and in general @xmath192 hence @xmath193 .",
    "the energy density contained in these modes at the begining of inflation is thus @xmath194 up to a numerical factor of order unity , with @xmath195 the occupation number ( we discard the zero - point energy ) .",
    "the ratio of this energy density to the critical energy density thus reads @xmath196 ; finally @xmath197 implies the very stringent constraint @xmath198 to avoid backreaction problems . in other words , either @xmath199 , which may seem unnatural , or @xmath200 which implies that these modes are in their vacuum state or very close to it .",
    "even though this argument was developed in the context of standard inflationary cosmology without modified dispersion relation and trans - planckian physics , it can be carried over directly to our present problem .    in fact , this has been done recently by tanaka  @xcite who assumed that the modification of the dispersion relation could be represented by a non - vacuum initial state in a theory with unmodified dispersion relation .",
    "this implied , in much the same way as above , that backreaction effects should be very important .",
    "starobinsky  @xcite has further argued that if adiabaticity is broken at some point in the evolution of a given mode , then at late times , when adiabaticity is restored , this mode behaves as the sum of positive and negative energy plane waves , meaning that a finite amount of quanta has been created , and the energy density they carry is large compared to the critical energy density today .",
    "however neither of these authors had at their disposal a rigorous expression for the energy density and they could not provide a quantitative estimate of this backreaction energy density . nevertheless as we show in the following their conclusions remain correct , notably because the correct expression for the energy density eq .",

    "in particular the following picture seems to emerge : if the evolution of the modes is adiabatic all throughout inflation up to horizon exit , then the power spectrum is unmodified ( or weakly modified ) , and backreaction is not an issue .",
    "if however adiabaticity is broken at some point , then modifications to the power spectrum are likely to appear ( except if the background spacetime is very close to de sitter ) , but effects of backreaction then appear generic , and one must use a higher order expansion of the einstein equations to derive meaningful conclusions . finally , there exists dispersion relations such that the backreaction is weak but modifications to the power spectrum are not negligible , notably when the ratio @xmath337 is not too large , when the time interval in which adiabaticity is broken is small , and when the background spacetime is not de sitter .",
    "however this obviously requires fine - tuning , and overall a scale invariant power spectrum does indeed appear robust against changes in the dispersion relation if backreaction can be neglected .",
