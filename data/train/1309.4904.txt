    "the post - main sequence evolution of massive stars is one of the major unsolved problems in massive star research .",
    "massive stars can pass through several short - lived phases , in which they lose tremendous amounts of mass via enhanced mass - loss and eruptive mass ejection events of yet unknown origin . during the classical blue supergiant ( bsg )",
    "stage mass - loss occurs via line - driven winds .",
    "the mass - loss rates involved are still uncertain and strongly depend on whether the winds emerge smoothly from the stellar surface or whether instabilities occur at the base of the wind , which result in the formation of clumpy structures .",
    "the cause of such instabilities is still unclear , but stellar pulsations , which were recently found in a couple of bsgs ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* saio et al . 2006 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lefever et al . 2007 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kraus et al . 2012 ) ) might influence , and maybe even trigger , enhanced mass loss from evolved hot stars . here",
    "we present recent results for a b[e ] star and a bsg .",
    "hd50138 , as a member of the b[e ] stars , is surrounded by high - density material giving rise to strong balmer and forbidden emission lines , and a circumstellar dusty disk ( @xmath0 ) resolved by interferometry ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* borges fernandes et al .",
    "it experienced outbursts and shell - phases in the past , and its location at the end of ( or slightly beyond ) the main - sequence evolution ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* borges fernandes et al .",
    "2009 ) ) , close to confirmed pulsating be stars , suggests pulsations as possible trigger for the outbursts .",
    "first indications for pulsational activity in the atmosphere of hd50138 were found from a sample of high - resolution spectra obtained during different observing runs at the 1.2-m mercator ( hermes ) and dao telescopes .",
    "the data showed strong night - to - night variability in all photospheric and wind lines ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* borges fernandes et al .",
    "in addition , the photospheric lines displayed a large broadening component of 30 - 40kms@xmath1 in excess to the stellar rotational broadening ( @xmath2kms@xmath1 ) .",
    "such high values of excess broadening ( referred to as ` macroturbulence ' ) is well known from bsgs and is attributed to pulsational activity ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* aerts et al . 2009 ) ) .",
    "application of the moment method ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* aerts et al .",
    "1992 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* north & paltani 1994 ) ) to the photospheric hei and siii lines suggests the presence of two possible periods ( 4.463h and 1.6 - 1.7d ) .",
    "the results for the hei 4026  line are depicted in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "if these periods are confirmed , hd50138 will be the first pulsating b[e ] star , and as such it will provide a very important milestone for our understanding of the triggering mechanism leading to mass ejection events in b[e ] stars .",
    "a second group of evolved hot and massive stars discussed during this meeting ( see godart et al .",
    ", this volume ) are bsgs . members of this class were long known to display strong photometric and spectroscopic variability , and the profiles of their photospheric lines contain large contributions from macroturbulent broadening in excess to rotational broadening ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ? * markova & puls 2008 ) ) , indicating stellar pulsational activity .",
    "in fact , recent theoretical investigations by ( * ? ? ? * saio et al .",
    "( 2006 ) ) revealed the presence of a new instability domain in the hrd covering the location of the bsgs .",
    "we study a sample of bright northern bsgs located within this instability domain using the perek 2-m telescope at ondejov observatory .",
    "one of the objects we are surveying is the early b - type supergiant 55cyg ( hd198478 ) . while its stellar parameters have been determined accurately from optical spectroscopy ( @xmath5k ; @xmath6 ; @xmath7kms@xmath1 ; @xmath8kms@xmath1 ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* markova & puls 2008 ) ) , the situation is less clear regarding the wind parameters .",
    "mass - loss rates and terminal wind velocities are typically obtained from the emission component of the h@xmath9 line .",
    "however , the h@xmath9 line displays strong night - to - night variability . from our long - term observations we found a zoo of profile shapes ranging from pcygni over pure single emission , almost complete disappearance , to double- or multiple - peaked , and no cyclic variation was found over a total of 25 consecutive observing nights .",
    "consequently , modeling the emission component of observations taken in different nights delivered different sets of wind parameters .",
    "so far we collected a total of 339 spectra in the h@xmath9 region distributed over 59 nights between august 2009 and august 2013 .",
    "the spectral coverage is 6270 - 6730  with a resolution of @xmath10 . of these",
    ", we modeled the h@xmath9 profile from 32 different nights using the nlte code fastwind ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* puls et al . 2005 ) ) to obtain the wind parameters .",
    "we found that the mass - loss rate , @xmath3 , and terminal wind velocity , @xmath4 , change simultaneously with large night - to - night variability ( fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "the value in both parameters spreads over more than a factor of three : @xmath11m@xmath12/yr and @xmath13km / s .    from the moment analysis of time - series within four and three consecutive nights of the hei 6678  line we obtained a possible pulsation period of 1.09d ( fig.[fig3 ] ) .",
    "the shift in radial velocity between the first and second set of time series suggests that the 1.09d period is superimposed on a second ( and probably more ) period(s ) .",
    "a proper period and mode analysis ( work in progress ) is necessary to confirm the identifications .",
