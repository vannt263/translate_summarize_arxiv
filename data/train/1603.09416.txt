    "very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) measures the differential arrival times of signals from extragalactic radio sources .",
    "it is currently the most powerful technique for measuring absolute positions of thousands of radio sources , the orientation and rotation speed of the earth and ground - based station coordinates , with an accuracy of about 1  cm ( or 0.1  mas ) .",
    "vlbi has been extensively used for astrometry and geodesy for about 30 years and , since 1998 , is operated by the international vlbi service ( ivs , schuh & behrend 2012 ) .",
    "vlbi allows an astrometric precision of @xmath0  @xmath1as ( fey et al .",
    "2015 ) .",
    "a dipole systematic caused by the galactocentric acceleration of the solar system barycentre was detected for the first time in vlbi data by titov et al .",
    "( 2011 , 2013 ) .",
    "the measured amplitude of the aberration drift is in good agreement with the value predicted by galactic models ( e.g. , reid et al .",
    "the quadrupole component presents some systematics that have to be clarified .",
    "a major interest of this component is that it can constrain hubble constant anisotropy or the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves ( kristian & sachs 1966 ; gwinn et al 1997 ) .",
    "the galactic aberration , or secular aberration drift , is a small proper motion of a few microarc seconds affecting distant bodies induced by the rotation of the solar system about the galactic center , which takes about 250  myr ( kovalevsky 2003 ) .",
    "this systematic effect appears as a dipolar deformation of the proper motion field towards the galactic center ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) with a magnitude about 6 @xmath1as / yr , corresponding to a solar system acceleration of @xmath4  km/@xmath5 in accordance with the equation as follows @xmath6 where the @xmath7 are the components of the acceleration vector in units of the proper motion , and which corresponds to the degree 1 spheroidal ( or electric ) development of ( e.g. , mignard & morando 1990 ) @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 the vector spherical harmonics of electric and magnetic types of degree @xmath14 and order  @xmath15 .",
    "in addition to the aberration distortion , there may also be a small global rotation which can be described by the toroidal ( or magnetic ) harmonics of degree  1 : @xmath16 where the @xmath17 can be expressed in terms of vector spherical harmonics coefficients as @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .    along with the aberration and rotation , more advanced cosmological effects may be detected using the proper motion of distant quasars .",
    "in particular , the anisotropic expansion of the universe would result in the degree 2 vector spherical harmonics of electric type , and the primordial gravitation waves would be an origin of the degree 2 harmonics of electric and magnetic types . to investigate a possible quadrupolar anisotropy of the velocity field ,",
    "let us give the development of the degree 2 vector spherical harmonics ( i.e. , @xmath21 in eq .",
