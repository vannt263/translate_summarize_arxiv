    "<S> the utility of prompt photon plus associated jet production for constraining the size and shape of the polarized gluon density of the proton @xmath0 is examined at @xmath1 gev , appropriate for the proposed hera-@xmath2 polarized @xmath3 collider experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation is performed at next - to - leading order ( o(@xmath4 ) ) in qcd . </S>",
    "<S> the reliability of the predictions are examined in some detail .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ section ] ] -    polarized deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) experiments have proved invaluable for providing information on the spin - dependent parton densities of the nucleon @xcite through measurement of the polarized structure functions such as @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> data from such experiments have traditionally been used in phenomenological analyses which attempt to constrain the polarized parton densities and evolve them in @xmath6 through the use of the spin - dependent altarelli - parisi evolution equations . </S>",
    "<S> up until fairly recently , all such analyses had to be performed in leading order ( lo ) qcd since the spin - dependent two loop splitting functions were unknown . </S>",
    "<S> since the two - loop splitting functions have been calculated @xcite , recent analyses have been performed in next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd @xcite and parametrizations of the polarized parton densities have been provided which can be used in calculations of other polarized processes .    in these analyses </S>",
    "<S> extensive use is made of theoretical constraints such as the bjorken sum rule in order to extract the parton densities from the polarized structure function measurements . despite this </S>",
    "<S> the data does not provide tight constraints on sizes , and even more so the shapes of either the polarized quark @xmath7 or gluon @xmath8 densities . </S>",
    "<S> this is true in particular for @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> each group provides more than one different parametrization of the parton densities , each set fitting the structure function data , but they can have very different individual parton densities reflecting the limited constraints on these quantities provided by dis experiments . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus very important , if our understanding of the spin structure of the nucleon is to be improved , that accurate measurements of these distributions be obtained from other processes .    </S>",
    "<S> since the cross section for prompt photon production is dominated by the subprocess @xmath10 in hadronic collisions already in leading order , it has proved very useful for providing information on the unpolarized gluon densities , @xmath11 , of hadrons at fixed target facilities . </S>",
    "<S> it has therefore been suggested that it may prove equally useful in pinning down the polarized gluon densities @xcite . in this context </S>",
    "<S> it has been examined quite extensively . </S>",
    "<S> the nlo corrections were calculated in @xcite and @xcite , where numerical estimates were also presented and it was established that the lo results were perturbatively stable . in both those analyses only lo polarized parton densities were available and the fragmentation contributions were not included . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , prompt photon production with polarized beam and target was examined in ref.@xcite using nlo polarized parton densities and including the fragmentation contributions .    </S>",
    "<S> although single inclusive prompt photon production will definitely be very important for constraining the size of @xmath9 , information on the detailed @xmath12-shape of the distribution may not be as easily extracted . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the calculation of the inclusive cross section involves one convolution over the momentum fractions , @xmath12 , of the initial partons . </S>",
    "<S> the practical effect of this is that a measurement of the kinematic variables of the photon is not sufficient to determine the value of @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> if , on the other hand , one or more of the jets produced in the reaction is also tagged , no convolution is involved in the calculation and the cross section is directly proportional to the parton densities . </S>",
    "<S> thus the double longitudinal asymmetry @xmath13 is directly proportional to the ratio @xmath14 @xcite in kinematic regions where other subprocesses such as @xmath15 scattering can be neglected .    </S>",
    "<S> schematically the cross section is given in terms of the polarized and unpolarized hard subprocess cross sections @xmath16 and parton densities @xmath17 ( the presence of the @xmath18 before a quantity means the polarized version of the quantity ) by @xmath19.\\ ] ] the @xmath20 indicates either a product or convolution and explicit dependence of the hard subprocess cross sections on the kinematic variables of the observed products and the renormalization and factorization scales have been omitted . </S>",
    "<S> the sum over @xmath21 extends over all initial partons and @xmath22 is the unpolarized fragmentation function for a parton , @xmath23 , into a photon at scale @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , just as in the single photon case , there are two classes of contributions to the cross section labelled the @xmath25 and @xmath26 contributions .    </S>",
    "<S> the polarized and unpolarized parton densities are defined by @xmath27 and @xmath28 where the @xmath29 and @xmath30 represent the distribution of partons of type @xmath31 with positive and negative helicities respectively , with respect to that of the parent hadron . </S>",
    "<S> the hard subprocess cross sections are defined by @xmath32 and @xmath33 one of the main quantities studied in polarized experiments is the longitudinal asymmetry @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> this quantity gives a measure of the sensitivity of the process to polarization effects . </S>",
    "<S> the double spin asymmetry studied in this paper is defined by @xmath34 the ratio of the cross section for longitudinal polarization of the incoming hadrons to the corresponding unpolarized cross section .    in lo </S>",
    "<S> the direct processes contributing to the cross section are @xmath35 and @xmath36 . in a lo jet calculation , </S>",
    "<S> the simple approximation ` parton = jet ' is used irrespective of the jet definition used in the experiments , hence either the final state gluon or quark will form the jet . </S>",
    "<S> it is only in nlo that more than one parton may make up a jet , and one finds a dependence of the cross section on the jet definition and parameters . </S>",
    "<S> in addition there are the fragmentation processes : @xmath37 where one of the final state partons fragments to produce the photon , i.e. , @xmath38 .    </S>",
    "<S> the cross section of interest here is the triple differential cross section @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the pseudorapidities of the photon and jet respectively and @xmath42 is the transverse momentum of the photon . </S>",
    "<S> the direct contribution to the cross section is given in lo by @xmath43 the corresponding fragmentation contributions will involve a convolution over the fragmentation variable @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the cms energy in the hadron - hadron system and as usual , @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the momenta of one of the initial state partons and the observed final state trigger photon respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the bjorken variables , @xmath50 , are given in terms of the kinematic variables of the photon and jet by @xmath51 in leading order @xmath52 and thus a measurement of @xmath42 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 means that @xmath50 can be determined . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , a measurement of @xmath53 corresponds to a measurement of @xmath54 . in nlo due to the presence of a third parton in the process </S>",
    "<S> this simple formula is no longer applicable . in that case , in order to determine @xmath50 unambiguously , one would need to measure the kinematic variables of all three final state partons . </S>",
    "<S> the values of @xmath50 are only approximately determined by the transverse momenta and pseudorapidities of the photon and jet in this case , due to the need to implement a jet definition . </S>",
    "<S> if photon isolation requirements are also implemented , then the determination of @xmath50 from the photon and jet kinematic variables would be even less precise . such a measurement would still nevertheless yield some very useful information on the @xmath12-dependence of the polarized parton densities as will be shown .    in nlo , @xmath55 </S>",
    "<S> , there are virtual corrections to the lo non - fragmentation processes , as well as the further three - body processes :    [ eq:1 ] @xmath56    the virtual corrections as well as the three - body matrix elements were calculated in ref.@xcite and i use these matrix elements in this calculation .    in principle the the fragmentation processes of eq.(1.7 ) should now be calculated to @xmath57 and convoluted with the nlo photon fragmentation functions whose leading behavior is @xmath58 , but the hard subprocess matrix elements are not yet available in the polarized case . hence unless otherwise stated , in both the polarized and unpolarized cases , i include the leading order contributions to these processes only </S>",
    "<S> . numerically the fragmentation processes are not significant except at extremely low @xmath59 due to the low cms energy of the fixed target experiment as i shall show later , but for a theoretically consistent calculation they should nevertheless be included as they help to reduce uncertainties from scale dependence .    for this calculation </S>",
    "<S> i use the monte carlo method first used in @xcite for the unpolarized case of the photon plus jet calculation performed here , as well as for calculations of some other important processes , to deal with the phase space integrals . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> i shall not give any details of the calculation except to say that the calculation was performed in the @xmath60 scheme using the thooft - veltman ( hvbm ) scheme @xcite to treat @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> i refer to ref.@xcite for the details of the calculation . at nlo , since there are two - to - three scattering processes included in the calculation it is possible that two partons may be too close together to be resolved as two separate jets . in this case </S>",
    "<S> a jet definition is required . in this calculation </S>",
    "<S> i use the cone definition proposed at snowmass @xcite , which defines a jet as hadronic energy deposited in a cone of radius @xmath62 . at the partonic level , if one parton forms the jet then the kinematic variable of the parton is set equal to that of the jet , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , and the jet is centered on the parton . </S>",
    "<S> if another parton falls inside the jet cone then the jet variables are the weighted averages of those of the two partons : @xmath66    all results are displayed for @xmath3 collisions at the center - of - mass energy @xmath67 gev appropriate for the proposed hera-@xmath68 experiment at desy @xcite . for the unpolarized cross section the cteq3 m parton densities are used throughout , and the value of @xmath69 corresponding to this distribution </S>",
    "<S> is also used . </S>",
    "<S> use of other unpolarized parton densities at the @xmath12-values probed here do not yield significantly different results . </S>",
    "<S> for the polarized case the grsv @xcite and gs @xcite distributions are used with the corresponding values for @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> the authors of ref.@xcite and @xcite have proposed various parametrizations of the polarized parton densities differing mainly in the choice of input for the polarized gluon density @xmath9 . in the case of the grsv distributions we use the ` valence ' set which corresponds to a fit of the available dis data ( referred to by the authors as the ` fitted ' @xmath9 scenario ) , the large gluon fit which assumes that @xmath70 at input ( the @xmath71 scenario ) and the small gluon fit which uses @xmath72 at the input scale ( the @xmath73 scenario ) , which in this case starts at the very low value of @xmath74 gev@xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> the latter two distributions are intended to represent extreme choices for @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> these parametrizations give gluon densities which differ in their absolute sizes as well as in their @xmath12-shape . </S>",
    "<S> the gs parametrizations provide three fits to the data ; gs a , gs b and gs c. it has been shown that the gs a and gs b distributions do not differ very much from the @xmath76 and fitted @xmath9 sets of grsv respectively , whereas the the gs c set is widely different from any of the others . </S>",
    "<S> i shall present distributions using the three grsv sets discussed above , along with the gs c set for comparison . for the fragmentation functions i use the lo asymptotic parametrization of ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as will be shown , the choice of fragmentation functions makes very little difference to the predictions , since these processes account for only a small fraction of the cross section .    </S>",
    "<S> the renormalization , factorization , and fragmentation scales are set to a common value @xmath77 unless otherwise stated . </S>",
    "<S> dependence on @xmath78 is examined in one of the figures below . </S>",
    "<S> since there are two ` particles ' in the final state , the jet and the photon , both of whose transverse momenta are large , an alternative choice might be @xmath79 or some function of @xmath80 and @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> the results of the calculations show that the magnitudes of @xmath80 and @xmath81 tend to be comparable and that dependence of the asymmetries on @xmath78 is slight , although the individual cross sections may vary significantly with @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , choices of @xmath78 different from @xmath77 should not produce significantly different predictions for the asymmetries . </S>",
    "<S> the two loop expression for @xmath82 is used throughout , with the number of flavors fixed at @xmath83 , although the contribution from charm was verified to be negligible at the energies considered . </S>",
    "<S> the value of the jet cone size is fixed at @xmath84 unless otherwise stated .    </S>",
    "<S> fig.1a shows the triple differential cross section as a function of @xmath85 of the photon for the various parametrizations . </S>",
    "<S> the unpolarized cross section is shown for comparison . </S>",
    "<S> the curves were obtained by averaging over @xmath86 and @xmath87 gev and the restriction @xmath88 was imposed . </S>",
    "<S> the upper dotted curve is for the gs a parametrization , verifying that it is very similar in both shape and size to the @xmath89 parametrization of grsv . </S>",
    "<S> all the remaining parametrizations give distributions which are distinctly different in both their shapes and sizes . </S>",
    "<S> if one compares these distributions with the corresponding curves for single inclusive prompt photon production @xcite one finds , apart from the expected fall in the absolute size of the cross section , that the corresponding distributions differ also in their shapes . </S>",
    "<S> this is most obvious for the gs c parametrization which has the most distinctly different shape . </S>",
    "<S> fig.1b also shows significantly larger asymmetries than the inclusive photon case for equivalent @xmath42 s . </S>",
    "<S> most of these differences can be traced to the fact that for the inclusive photon case , a given value of @xmath42 corresponds to a much less sharply defined value of @xmath12 than in the photon plus jet case . in fig.1a , b the range @xmath90 gev corresponds to @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> it was also verified that for all parametrizations , the @xmath92 scattering process accounts for more than @xmath93 of the cross sections . also plotted in fig.1b </S>",
    "<S> are the projected statistical errors in the asymmetries , @xmath94 , as estimated in ref.@xcite from the formula @xmath95 in @xcite @xmath94 has been calculated by assuming an integrated luminosity of @xmath96 pb@xmath97 and beam and target polarizations of @xmath98 and @xmath99 , and including a trigger and reconstruction efficiency of @xmath100 with no acceptance correction . </S>",
    "<S> similar errors for @xmath94 were estimated in @xcite by integrating the unpolarized cross section over bins of sizes @xmath86 and @xmath101 gev . </S>",
    "<S> we use the same proceedure here . </S>",
    "<S> the results indicate that for @xmath102 gev the asymmetries will be distinguishable .    </S>",
    "<S> fig.1c and fig.1d are similar to figs.1a , b but in this case both the jet and photon are restricted to the forward rapidity regions . @xmath40 and @xmath41 are centered at @xmath103 , with @xmath104 . at @xmath105 gev this corresponds to probing @xmath50 in bins centered at the points @xmath106 and @xmath107 . </S>",
    "<S> the asymmetries are smaller than in fig.1b but again there are clear distinctions in sizes and shapes for the different parametrizations .    in fig.2 </S>",
    "<S> we look at distributions in @xmath40 at @xmath105 gev and allow @xmath81 to vary between @xmath108 and @xmath109 gev . in fig.2a the jet is restricted to be in the central region , @xmath110 , and in fig.2c it is restricted to the forward region , @xmath111 . </S>",
    "<S> the asymmetry plots of fig.2b shows important differences between the various parametrizations but that of fig.2d is very striking . </S>",
    "<S> the asymmetries are rather flat , although showing differences in shape for the various parametrizations in the positive rapidity regions , but are very large and increase very sharply in the negative rapidity region , almost approaching @xmath112 at the edge of phase space for the @xmath71 scenario .    </S>",
    "<S> an examination of fig.2c shows that this effect originates with the difference in shapes between the polarized and the unpolarized rapidity distributions . </S>",
    "<S> it was argued in ref.@xcite that positive rapidity correlations at collider energies are an inherent property of the hard subprocess matrix elements . </S>",
    "<S> thus if one restricts the jet to be at positive rapidity then the rapidity distribution of the photon would be expected to peak in the positive rapidity region . </S>",
    "<S> this was verified recently in ref.@xcite where prompt photon plus charm quark correlations were studied at nlo . clearly in fig.2c </S>",
    "<S> this expectation is confirmed for the unpolarized cross section , but in contrast the polarized cross sections show _ negative _ correlations . </S>",
    "<S> since the propagators in the hard subprocess matrix elements are the same this can only be due to the differences between the polarized and unpolarized parton densities . </S>",
    "<S> this fact was verified by using artificial polarized parton densities of exactly the same shape as the unpolarized ones along with the polarized matrix elements . in that case </S>",
    "<S> positive rapidity correlations between the photon and the jet were obtained .    in ref.@xcite it is suggested that it is the behavior at small-@xmath113 of the product @xmath114 along with the structure of the hard subprocess matrix elements which generate the positive rapidity correlations between two final state particles . </S>",
    "<S> it is well established that the small-@xmath12 behavior of the ratio @xmath14 is @xmath115 as @xmath116 . </S>",
    "<S> hence there is an additional power of @xmath12 in the polarized parton distributions at small-@xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> this also applies in the set for which @xmath71 at the input scale . at the scale we are considering ( @xmath117 gev@xmath75 ) the evolution equations determine the shape of the parton densities regardless of the shape at the input scale . </S>",
    "<S> therefore given the fact that the behavior of the ratio @xmath14 at small-@xmath12 is generated by the polarized altarelli - parisi equations themselves @xcite and that the grsv input scale is so low ( @xmath118 gev@xmath75 ) , it is understandable that even the @xmath71 scenario will also show the same small-@xmath12 behavior characteristic of the polarized parton densities . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to show from eq.(1.9 ) @xcite that when only two final state particles are present , as is the case in lo @xmath119 the effect of this additional factor is to suppress the polarized rapidity distributions at the point @xmath120 and produce two symmetrical peaks on both sides of this point . </S>",
    "<S> there are many other factors such as , for example , available phase phase which also affect the rapidity correlations and may tend to obscure the effect of the small-@xmath12 behavior , but from fig.2d the effect is a significant rise in the predicted asymmetries at negative rapidities . </S>",
    "<S> this strong sensitivity to polarization effects in this region should serve as a very good test of the underlying qcd mechanism as well as a check on assumptions about the small-@xmath12 behavior of the polarized parton densities .    in order to test the sensitivity of the predictions to the choice of factorization and renormalization scales , fig.3a shows predictions for the asymmetry of a sample of the the @xmath42 distributions of fig.1a for three different scales . </S>",
    "<S> all hard scales are kept equal and varied simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> although , as in the case of single prompt photon production , varying the scales over the full range shown can change the individual cross sections by up to @xmath100 , the predicted asymmetries are relatively stable . in fig.3b the sensitivity of the predicted asymmetries to the cone size of the jet @xmath121 and to the inclusion of the fragmentation contributions is tested . </S>",
    "<S> the solid lines are again the predictions of fig.1b . </S>",
    "<S> setting @xmath122 clearly has very little effect on the asymmetries , meaning that the predictions are likely to be very similar if nlo corrections to these contributions were included . </S>",
    "<S> this could be expected since at this cms energy , fragmentation is less the @xmath123 of the cross section except at the very lowest @xmath59 values . </S>",
    "<S> the dotted line in fig.3b shows the effect of setting @xmath124 . </S>",
    "<S> the effect on the cross sections is generally less than @xmath123 and clearly it has no effect at all on the asymmetries .    since in this calculation a jet definition is involved in nlo , the calculation of a so - called k - factor to estimate the size of the nlo corrections is not meaningful , as it would depend on the value of @xmath121 chosen . </S>",
    "<S> thus in fig.3c , a comparison is made between predictions for the cross section using the lo and nlo matrix elements but both using the nlo structure functions . </S>",
    "<S> the aim is to examine whether the nlo matrix elements and jet definition have any effect on the shapes of the distributions . </S>",
    "<S> as stated earlier , in nlo , measuring the kinematic variables of the photon and jet does not serve to uniquely determine the values of @xmath125 and @xmath126 . </S>",
    "<S> any significant differences between the values of these variables probed in lo and nlo could possible show up as a difference in the shapes of the distributions . </S>",
    "<S> figs.3a , b clearly show that there are no significant shape differences between the lo and nlo distributions , and therefore one can assume that estimating the values of @xmath12 probed for a given kinematical configuration of the photon and jet by the lo formula may not lead to unacceptably large errors .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> i have examined the possibility that both the size and @xmath12-shape of the polarized gluon distribution of the proton , @xmath9 , may be measured at hera-@xmath68 via a measurement of the photon plus jet cross section . </S>",
    "<S> control over the kinematic variables of both the photon and jet allows a much better determination of the @xmath12-value probed when compared to inclusive prompt photon production . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison of the predictions obtained using different polarized parton densities show that a clear distinction between both the sizes and shapes should be possible . assuming that the ` fitted @xmath9 ' scenario is the most plausible distribution , then a typical value for the asymmetry , @xmath13 is @xmath123 , but given the uncertainty in @xmath9 the asymmetry could be as small as @xmath127 or as large as @xmath128 . </S>",
    "<S> the expected small-@xmath12 behavior of the polarized distributions lead to predictions of negative correlations between the rapidities of the photon and jet . </S>",
    "<S> the effect is to produce very large asymmetries , even approaching the maximum value of @xmath129 in certain kinematic regions , which should make them more easily measurable in the experiments . </S>"
