    "observations of the large scale peculiar velocity field provide an important tool for probing mass fluctuations on @xmath4 100 h@xmath5 mpc scales ( h is the hubble constant in units of 100 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 ) .",
    "analyses of peculiar velocity surveys used to constrain the amplitude of mass power spectrum @xcite are complementary to those that employ redshift surveys alone ( e.g. @xcite ) or in combination with cmb data @xcite .",
    "although initially peculiar velocity surveys using redshift independent distance indicators were sparse and shallow @xcite , large , homogeneous redshift  distance samples of galaxies and clusters have become increasingly common .",
    "early analyses of redshift  distance surveys @xcite led to the development of powerful statistical methods for the analysis of peculiar velocity data @xcite , but were hindered by shallow and sparse samples .",
    "however , with the advent of larger and better samples @xcite it has become increasingly clear that peculiar velocity catalogues can play an important role in the determination of cosmological parameters .",
    "recently , several studies have compared peculiar velocity surveys directly to the density field as determined from redshift surveys and put strong constraints on the combination of parameters @xmath1 ( for a summary , see pike & hudson 2005 ) .",
    "these studies have involved peculiar velocity data derived from several different distance measures , as well as three different redshift surveys , and yet have produced remarkably consistent results .",
    "when one considers that the constraints from these studies are also consistent with those derived from other types of studies , it seems reasonable to consider our knowledge of @xmath1 to be firmly established .    the combination of parameters @xmath1 essentially determines the amplitude of the velocity power spectrum .",
    "the shape of the power spectrum can also be constrained using peculiar velocity data , but efforts of this type have typically tried to constrain the amplitude and shape together , resulting in constraints on a two - dimensional space of parameters ( see , jaffe & kaiser 1995 , borgani et al .",
    "2000 ) . in this",
    "_ paper _ we use peculiar velocity surveys to put constraints on power spectrum parameters directly through linear theory . by using the constraint on @xmath1 as a prior",
    ", we are able to calculate the likelihood function for the `` shape '' parameter , @xmath0 , of the power spectrum by itself , resulting in a simple one - dimensional constraint on this parameter .    given that our analysis uses linear theory , it is important that we properly filter out small - scale flows due to nonlinear effects that are present in peculiar velocity surveys .",
    "for this reason , we follow jaffe & kaiser ( 1995 ) in analyzing surveys using only the two lowest order moments of the velocity field , the nine bulk flow and shear moments . for the sizes and depths of the surveys that we are considering , the bulk flow and shear moments probe velocity modes with wave numbers well above the scales where nonlinear effects are thought to be important .",
    "significantly , the bulk flow and shear moments are also the velocity moments that have the highest signal - to - noise and thus can be determined most accurately ; indeed , little useful information is lost by discarding higher order moments .    we apply our analysis to an extensive set of peculiar velocity surveys .",
    "each of these surveys employs a different method of distance estimation , and target different populations of galaxies .",
    "we expect that each survey is affected by nonlinearities in different ways ; this could be reflected as differing amounts of small - scale motion superimposed upon the large - scale linear flow reflected in the bulk flow and shear .",
    "these small - scale motions can be quantified by a standard deviation @xmath2 of the velocities remaining after the bulk flow and shear have been subtracted out . while @xmath2 is typically given a fixed value of around @xmath6 km / sec in this type of analysis @xcite , in order to improve the accuracy of our study we have calculated the maximum likelihood value of @xmath2 directly for each survey using an iterative method .",
    "an important question , then , is how well does the information about large - scale flows contained in these different surveys agree ? in order to answer this question",
    "quantitatively , we calculate the covariance matrix for the _ differences _ between the values of the bulk flow and shear moments for two surveys .",
    "the covariance matrix , together with the measured differences , allows us to calculate a @xmath7 that reflects the probability that both surveys reflect the same underlying large - scale flow .",
    "this probability is most useful when surveys are similar in their characteristics , as the surveys that we consider are ; two surveys that probe the velocity field in different ways can have a high probability of agreement even when the values of their bulk flow and shear moments are quite different .    in @xmath8 2 ,",
    "we give the details of our likelihood analysis . in @xmath8 3",
    "we discuss the power spectrum parametrization we use . in @xmath8 4",
    ", we describe the peculiar velocity surveys used in the analysis . in @xmath8 5",
    "we present our results , and in @xmath8 6 we discuss them and compare them to constraints on the shape parameter derived from other types of data .",
    "small scale motions of galaxies reflect nonlinear evolution and can depend strongly on the specific population of galaxies that are sampled in a survey .",
    "however , by forming velocity moments out of weighted sums of individual velocities that reflect only large scale motions , we expect small scale motions to average out so that linear theory is applicable . in this study",
    ", we focus on the measures of the large scale flow given by the first and second order moments of a taylor expansion of the velocity field , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the bulk flow vector and @xmath11 is the shear tensor , which can be taken to be symmetric .",
    "while the interpretation of these measures depend on the specific distribution of galaxies in a survey as well as measurement errors , the surveys we consider are similar enough that they form a good basis for comparison @xcite .",
    "the samples that we consider consist of a set of @xmath12 galaxies , each with a position vector @xmath13 and a measured line - of - sight peculiar velocity @xmath14 with individual measurement error @xmath15 . following @xcite , we group the bulk flow and shear components into a 9 component vector @xmath16 , so that the galaxy velocities can be modeled as @xmath17 where the 9 component vector @xmath18 @xmath19 . in what follows",
    "we take our coordinate axes to correspond to galactic coordinates .",
    "the deviation from the model , @xmath20 , contains contributions from both small scale motions and measurement errors .",
    "we assume that the @xmath20 values are gaussian distributed and have a variance given by @xmath21 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath2 represents the small - scale linear and nonlinear motions that are not accounted for by the bulk flow and shear .",
    "we shall refer to @xmath2 as the velocity noise .    under these assumptions ,",
    "the likelihood function for the moments is @xmath22 ^ 2\\over   \\sigma_n^2+\\sigma_*^2}\\right ) .",
    "\\label{eq : ml}\\ ] ]    for a given survey , we would like to find the maximum likelihood values for the moments @xmath16 and for @xmath2 .",
    "in previous analyses of this type , the value of @xmath2 has sometimes been determined by an educated guess ( see , @xcite ) .",
    "however , we note that since surveys generally sample a specific population of galaxies , each of which can be differently affected by nonlinear overdensities , we expect that each survey has , in principle , a different value for @xmath2 .",
    "thus , here we determine the value of @xmath2 directly from each survey .",
    "we find the maximum likelihood values for the moments @xmath16 and @xmath2 using an iterative method .",
    "we start by making a  guess \" of @xmath23 km / sec . treating @xmath2 for the moment as constant , the maximum likelihood solution for the @xmath16",
    "is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25    using these estimates in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ml ] ) and treating them as constant , we then find the maximum likelihood value of @xmath2 , which now replaces our original guess and can be used to calculate a refined set of maximum likelihood values for the @xmath16 .",
    "this process is repeated until the estimates converge , which in practice only takes two or three iterations .    in order to compare our estimates of the moments @xmath16 to the expectations of theoretical models ,",
    "we calculate the covariance matrix , which from eq .",
    "( [ eq : mla ] ) can be written as @xmath26 where @xmath27 can be written in terms of the linear velocity field @xmath28 and the variance of the scatter about it , @xmath29 plugging eq .",
    "( [ eq : galv ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : cov ] ) , the covariance matrix reduces to two terms , @xmath30 the second term , called the `` noise '' term , can be shown to be @xmath31 the first term is given as an integral over the matter fluctuation power spectrum , @xmath32 , @xmath33 where the angle - averaged tensor window function is @xmath34.\\ ] ]    given a peculiar velocity survey and the values of its 9 moments , we can write the likelihood of a theoretical model used to calculate the covariance matrix as @xmath35 as we describe below , we use this equation in order to place constraints on the parameters of cosmological models ; in particular @xmath0 , the parameter that determines the shape of the power spectrum .",
    "both the bulk flow and shear moments probe primarily large - scale motions and thus have window functions that are peaked at large scales . however , our prior constraint on @xmath1 essentially fixes the amplitude of the power spectrum on relatively small scales .",
    "since the shape parameter @xmath0 controls the relative distribution of power between large and small scales ( smaller @xmath0 corresponds to relatively more power on large scales ) , increasing @xmath0 generally results in smaller values for the elements @xmath36 of the covariance matrix .",
    "( [ eq : likelihood ] ) shows that surveys with large values of the bulk flow and shear moments generally favor smaller values of @xmath0 .",
    "the window function for a given survey carries information about how the moments of that survey sample the power spectrum .",
    "since each survey has a unique window function , the values of the moments are not strictly comparable between surveys @xcite .",
    "however , since the volumes occupied by the surveys we consider overlap strongly , we expect the values of the moments of these surveys to be highly correlated . in order to quantify the agreement between two different surveys ,",
    "say , survey @xmath37 and survey @xmath38 , we use the covariance matrix for the _ difference _ between the values @xmath39 and @xmath40 of the moments for the two surveys , @xmath41 where the cross - terms are given by @xmath42 and @xmath43 . \\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note that we have assumed here that the nonlinear contributions to the velocities of the galaxies represented by @xmath2 in the two surveys are uncorrelated .",
    "this is not likely to be true in reality , since galaxies in the same local neighborhood are affected by the same small - scale flows .",
    "however , this will always cause us to underestimate the expected amount of correlation between surveys .",
    "thus our results on how well two surveys agree should be considered as upper bounds .",
    "as shown in eqs . ( [ eq : covv ] ) and ( [ eq : covv - diff ] ) , in linear theory the variances for the velocity components @xmath16 are given by integrals over the power spectrum @xmath32 multiplied by the factor @xmath44 .",
    "the power spectrum @xmath32 can itself be modeled as an initial power law @xmath45 , where we assume the usual @xmath46 , times the square of the transfer function @xmath47 , so that @xmath48 .",
    "we set the overall amplitude of the power spectrum in the usual way through the constant @xmath49 , the amplitude of matter density perturbations on the scale of @xmath50mpc . the transfer function is generally parametrized in terms of the  shape \" parameter @xmath51 .",
    "we follow eisenstein and hu ( 1998 ) in writing the transfer function as @xmath52 which is valid in the zero - baryon approximation . while eisenstein and hu ( 1998 ) include a more accurate model for the power spectrum that includes the effects of baryons , this model depends on several more parameters and does not have a constant @xmath0 .",
    "we have found that there is not enough information in the peculiar velocity data to break the degeneracies between these parameters , and that a two parameter model is sufficient given the precision of our results .",
    "we will revisit the issue of baryons in the discussion section ( @xmath8 6 ) when we interpret our results .",
    "we have applied our analysis to four peculiar velocity catalogues .",
    "these catalogues vary in their sample size , depth , distance measurement method , and typical measurement errors .",
    "our subset of the spiral field _",
    "i_-band ( sfi ) survey ( haynes et al .",
    "1999a , 1999b ) consists of 1016 galaxies at distances @xmath53   @xmath54mpc with velocities @xmath55 km / sec .",
    "the distance measurements , obtained using the _ i_-band tully - fisher ( tf ) relation , have been corrected for malmquist and other biases as described in giovanelli ( 1997 ) .",
    "the distance cut was made to avoid the bias toward inwardly moving galaxies near the redshift limit of the survey .",
    "the cut on large velocity galaxies was made to prevent them from having an undue effect on our results .",
    "we have tested that our results are not sensitive to the precise way in which these cuts are made .",
    "distance errors on this sample are of order 16% .    our subset of the nearby early - type galaxy ( enear ) survey ( da costa et al .",

    "the @xmath58 distance estimates in this catalogue have been corrected for inhomogeneous malmquist bias @xcite .",
    "a correction has also been applied for the bias toward inwardly moving galaxies at the redshift limit of the catalogue ; however , given the large size of this correction for galaxies near the limit , we chose to apply a distance cut in order to avoid the effects of this bias and its correction on our sample . distance errors for this sample are of the order of @xmath59 for individual galaxies with groups of size @xmath12 having their distance errors reduced by a factor of @xmath60 .",
    "our subset of the @xmath61-band surface brightness fluctuation survey of galaxy distances ( sbf ; @xcite ) contains 257 e , s0 , and early - type spiral galaxies out to a redshift of about @xmath62 km / sec .",
    "we have removed galaxies with percentage distance errors ( @xmath63 ) as well as three high - velocity galaxies with redshifts @xmath64 km / sec .",
    "more than half of the galaxies in our sample have distance errors below @xmath65 , with the smallest errors being less than @xmath66 . with errors of this magnitude",
    ", our sample is immune from the effects of malmquist bias @xcite .",
    "finally , we have included a small sample of 73 supernovae of type ia ( snia ; tonry et al .",
    "2003 ) whose redshifts extend to 8000 km / sec .",
    "typical distance errors for this sample are about @xmath67 ; one supernova whose distance error exceeded @xmath68 was not included .",
    "as with sbf , this sample should be immune from malmquist bias .",
    "the first step in our analysis is to obtain estimates for the moments @xmath16 and the velocity noise @xmath2 for each catalogue by maximizing the likelihood function ( eq . [ eq : likelihood ] ) as described above .",
    "the calculated moments and @xmath2 for each survey are given in table 1 .",
    "note that the estimates for the bulk flow vectors are quite similar , as one would expect for surveys that occupy similar volumes .",
    "the shear moments are somewhat less consistent due to both the facts that these moments are estimated less accurately and also depend more strongly on the details of the sample geometries .",

    "since the different values of @xmath2 for the various surveys reflect differences in the populations and distance measures between the surveys , we assign each galaxy in the composite survey the value of @xmath2 of its parent survey . in figure",

    "our results show consistency between catalogues containing galaxies of different morphologies and using different methods for determining velocities , confirming that each of these catalogues trace the same large - scale velocity field within uncertainties .",
    "while previous studies have shown consistency in the bulk flow vectors calculated from different surveys @xcite , our result is the first to directly compare both bulk flow and shear moments .",
    "the samples we considered do show differences on small scales ; in particular , the velocity dispersion about the bulk flow and shear motions , represented by @xmath2 , shows a range of values .",
    "while these differences in @xmath2 could arise from how different galaxy populations respond to nonlinearities , underestimates of measurement errors are also a likely source for @xmath2 .",

    "the plot also illustrates the substantial degeneracy between the two parameters ; the ridge that extends diagonally across contains a large region where the likelihood is close to its maximum . without applying a prior , as we have done ,",

    "note that the location of these contours would change if a different region of parameter space was selected.,width=566 ]    it is noteworthy that combining all of the survey data into a single survey did not improve the constraint on @xmath0 as much as one might have expected . while combining the data",
    "did improve the measurements of the bulk flow and shear , cosmic variance limits how strong a constraint that even perfect knowledge of these nine quantities measured for a single volume can provide .",
    "it is important to remember that the power spectrum determines only the _ variances _ of these nine quantities ; thus our situation is similar to that of trying to constrain the variance of a statistical distribution from nine numbers drawn from that distribution . in light of this",
    ", significant improvements of our constraint will be difficult to obtain . increasing the number of moments by expanding the velocity field to higher order is likely to move the analysis into a regime where linear theory is no longer applicable .",
    "deeper surveys , whose bulk flow and shear are sensitive to larger scale power , could strengthen our constraint ; however , given that measurement errors typically increase linearly with distance , the number of galaxies required for a reasonable analysis is prohibitive .",
