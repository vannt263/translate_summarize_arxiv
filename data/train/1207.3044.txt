    "in this paper we consider fluctuations of the steady - state current , and of its close relative , the current _ activity _ , in the one - dimensional totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) .",
    "this model is among the simplest in non - equilibrium physics , while at the same time exhibiting many non - trivial properties  @xcite .",
    "some relevant developments in the study of current fluctuations are as follows : exact expressions for the diffusion constant were found for systems with periodic ( pbc )  @xcite and open  @xcite boundary conditions ( bc ) ; the full probability distribution function ( pdf ) of current fluctuations was similarly considered for both pbc  @xcite and open  @xcite bc .",
    "very recently , a number of new results have been found for current fluctuations in systems with open bc  @xcite .    in a recent publication  @xcite ,",
    "exact and numerical results were given for steady - state current activity fluctuations in the one - dimensional tasep , for both periodic and open boundary conditions . by making use of the known steady - state operator algebra  @xcite ,",
    "exact expressions were derived for the three lowest moments of the activity pdf , which fully display their finite - size dependence .",
    "all these were confirmed to excellent degree of accuracy by numerical simulations .",
    "the results of ref .   extend and complement earlier analytic work on the joint distribution of current activity and density for the tasep  @xcite .",
    "we recall that the current activity ( henceforth denominated simply _ activity _ ) is not identical to the standard current , although the first moments of the respective distributions coincide . as explained below",
    ", the former quantity is _",
    "static _ , in this sense akin to the instantaneous ( local or global ) particle density , while the latter is a dynamic one .",
    "many exact results available for current fluctuations pertain to the infinite - system limit  @xcite , although the diffusion constant has been calculated for finite systems  @xcite .",
    "finite - size effects have been considered also , e.g. , in refs .  .",
    "our main purpose here is to exploit the possible connections between activity- and current fluctuations . given that the former quantity has proved amenable to such detailed description , it is desirable to check whether its properties can help explain any relevant aspects of the latter .    in the time evolution of the @xmath0 dimensional tasep ,",
    "the particle number @xmath1 at lattice site @xmath2 can be @xmath3 or @xmath4 , and the forward hopping of particles is only to an empty adjacent site .",
    "the stochastic character comes from random selection of site occupation update  @xcite : if site @xmath2 is chosen for update , the instantaneous current across the bond from @xmath2 to @xmath5 is given by @xmath6  .    with open boundary conditions , the case considered here , the additional externally - imposed parameters are : the injection ( attempt ) rate @xmath7 at the left end , and the ejection rate @xmath8 at the right one .",
    "the phase diagram in @xmath7@xmath8 parameter space , reproduced in figure  [ fig : obc_pd ] below , is known exactly , as well as many other steady state properties  @xcite .",
    "the total ( instantaneous ) activity @xmath9 within the system is defined as the number of bonds that can facilitate a transition of a particle in the immediate future .",
    "thus it equals the number of pairs of neighboring sites that have a particle to the left and a hole to the right  @xcite . for systems with open bc ,",
    "one usually includes also the injection and ejection bonds at the system s ends , though these have to be weighted by the respective injection and ejection rates , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .    for an @xmath10site system with open bc ( @xmath10 sites and @xmath11 bonds , including the injection and ejection ones ) ,",
    "one has : @xmath12    the activity is a snapshot of the system at a given moment in its evolution ; in this sense , it is as much of a static quantity as , for example , the instantaneous global density .",
    "by contrast , the current is a dynamic object , as it reflects the stochastically - determined particle displacements which actually take place during a unit time interval .",
    "the investigation of current fluctuations is usually carried out by examining the total charge ( i.e. , number of particles ) crossing a given bond , during a long time interval in the steady state regime  @xcite .",
    "the ( properly normalized ) first moments of activity and current pdfs coincide . for @xmath9 as defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : adef ] ) one has : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the average steady - state current through any bond in the system , and brackets @xmath15 denote ensemble averages .",
    "the above equality can be understood by recalling that successive steady - state snapshots ( activity configurations ) are generated via the intervening particle hoppings , which constitute realizations of the system s current . in our simulations of ref .",
    "we verified that this property holds , to within numerical accuracy , in all cases investigated there .",
    "however , the connection at this level is not sufficient to warrant equality of higher moments of the pdfs .",
    "here we restrict ourselves to the second and third cumulants of current- and activity pdfs .",
    "these already provide significant illustrations of the diversity of behavior which it is our purpose to investigate .",
    "while more precise definitions are deferred to section  [ sec : th ] below , tables  [ t1 ] and  [ t2 ] , and figure  [ fig : pd ] , give a broad perspective of properties , such as system - size dependence or @xmath16 limiting values , of these cumulants , or quantities associated to them ( respectively , variance and skewness  @xcite for activity ; diffusion constant  @xcite and skew  @xcite for current ) .",

    "[ fig : pd ] ) , while those related to the standard current usually approach finite limits ( except for the diffusion constant in the mc phase , see table  [ t1 ] , and the skew on the lines @xmath28 deep inside the lc phase , see table  [ t2 ] ) .",
    "here we wish to pin down the causes for such variety of behavior in apparently similar fluctuation - related quantities .",
    "as shown in the following , a fruitful line of enquiry is to probe the relative importance of different types of correlations which occur in this context : local versus global ( i.e. systemwide ) , as well as equal- versus non - equal time ( see section  [ sec : th ] for precise definitions ) .",
    "section  [ sec : th ] below recalls selected existing results , and gives a theoretical background to the concepts used in this work . in section  [ sec : nr ] , our numerical simulations are described , and their corresponding results are exhibited . in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] we provide a global analysis of the numerical results ; finally , concluding remarks are made .",
    "in studies of current fluctuations for the tasep , one considers the steady - state current through a specified bond connecting sites @xmath2 and @xmath29 , henceforth denoted by @xmath30 , and the associated integrated charge @xmath31 . with open bc ,",
    "the leftmost ( injection ) bond @xmath32 is usually singled out for examination , although the results for the pdf of steady - state current fluctuations would be the same for any choice of @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "thus , here we frequently omit bond labels wherever this does not give rise to ambiguity . also , it is usual to remove the linear term from the integrated charge , and to consider instead : @xmath33 so @xmath34 .",
    "closed - form expressions are available for @xmath14 as a function of @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and number of sites @xmath10  @xcite ; see , e.g. , eqs .",
    "( 29 ) and  ( 32)(34 ) of ref .  .",
    "for @xmath35 , exact expressions for the lowest - order cumulants , @xmath36 , of the integrated current have been proposed : for @xmath37 and any @xmath10 , everywhere on the phase diagram  @xcite ; for @xmath38 and @xmath26 , anywhere except for the maximal - current phase @xmath7 , @xmath39  @xcite ; and ( via a parametric representation ) for any @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath10 , essentially for all @xmath40  @xcite . in the latter",
    ", explicit expressions are forthcoming only for @xmath26 away from the maximal - current phase , and for @xmath41 , any @xmath10 , at @xmath42 .",
    "the above results agree with each other , wherever comparison is possible .",
    "furthermore , on the basis of general properties of the associated generating function ( see e.g. ref .  ) , the assumption is made that all cumulants scale linearly with time , so the quantities of interest are the @xmath43 , which are frequently referred to as _ cumulants of the local current _",
    "so , @xmath44 is the diffusion constant , and @xmath45 the skew , both mentioned in connection with tables  [ t1 ] and  [ t2 ] .",
    "a direct elementary illustration of such linear dependence can be given by considering the variance @xmath46  . with @xmath47 , assuming an exponential decay of the current - current correlation function , @xmath48 , and using steady - state properties , one has : @xmath49 an interesting exception to the above has been pointed out in ref .",
    ", where theoretical and numerical arguments are presented to show that @xmath50 for @xmath51 at the second - order phase boundary between low- and maximal - current phases .",
    "we shall return to this later .    as recalled in eq .",
    "( [ eq : q2proptot ] ) , the cumulants @xmath52 , @xmath51 , involve unequal - time correlations  @xcite , because the integrated charge accumulates local current fluctuations over time .",
    "in contrast , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : adef ] ) , the nontrivial features of ( instantaneous ) activity statistics arise because it adds contributions from all sites in the system , thus it depends on non - local , equal - time , correlations  @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is because @xmath53 is the sum of @xmath54 equal - time stochastic ( albeit not independent ) variables that the variance and skewness ( and , most likely , higher - order moments ) of its pdf always approach zero for large @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "the spatially local character of the @xmath52 , in turn , implies less severe @xmath10-dependent effects on these quantities ; thus the @xmath55 generally converge towards non - zero values for @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "as stated in section  [ intro ] , we wish to consider the relative importance of local and non - local ( equal and non - equal time ) correlations .",
    "we then define a hybrid quantity , the _ position - averaged _",
    "( instantaneous ) _ current _ @xmath56 : @xmath57 the ensemble average of @xmath56 coincides with that of the normalized activity , see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : adef ] ) and  ( [ eq : a - j ] ) , and of course with the steady - state current @xmath14 .",
    "the cumulants of its integral over time , @xmath58 incorporate both equal- and unequal - time ( as well as local and non - local ) correlations . for consistency , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : qtilde ] ) , we also subtract the linear contribution , @xmath59 , from @xmath60 .    in order to draw relevant distinctions and similarities with @xmath60",
    ", we also consider the integrated ( normalized ) activity , @xmath61 ( again , with the linear contribution @xmath59 subtracted ) .    in",
    "what follows , we show results of numerical simulations of @xmath56 and associated quantities such as the cumulants of @xmath60 , as well as those of @xmath62 , in comparison with those corresponding to the local current .",
    "to make contact with previous work , we usually considered lattices either with @xmath63 sites , as done in local - current simulations  @xcite , or with @xmath64 , for which many results on activity statistics are available  @xcite .",
    "it is important to take @xmath65 not only in order to minimize finite - size effects , but also because some features such as the non - linear scaling of current cumulants with time , referred to above , occur only during time `` windows '' whose width increases as @xmath10 grows large  @xcite .    in our simulations ,",
    "a time step is defined as a set of @xmath10 sequential update attempts , each of these according to the following rules : ( 1 ) select a site at random ; ( 2a ) if the chosen site is the rightmost one and is occupied , then ( 3a ) eject the particle from it with probability @xmath8 ; alternatively , ( 2b ) if the site is the leftmost one and is empty , then ( 3b ) inject a particle onto it with probability @xmath7 ; finally , if neither ( 2a ) nor ( 2b ) is true , ( 2c ) if the site is occupied and its neighbor to the right is empty , then ( 3c ) move the particle .",
    "thus , in the course of one time step , some sites may be selected more than once for examination , and some may not be examined at all .",
    "this corresponds to the random - sequential update procedure of ref .  .",
    "note that other types of update are possible ( e.g. , ordered - sequential or parallel ) . though the resulting phase diagrams are similar in all cases ( but not identical :",
    "even the average current differs in either case , see table 1 in ref .  ) , the updating algorithm which corresponds to the operator algebra described in ref .",
    "[ @xmath66and thus to many subsequent results either directly derived from that algebra  @xcite , or from bethe - ansatz techniques which are based on it  @xcite@xmath66 ] is random - sequential  @xcite .    for the various sets of @xmath7 , @xmath8 considered here [ @xmath66because of particle - hole duality",
    ", we take only @xmath68 , we found that for @xmath63 and starting from an initial random configuration of occupied sites , one needs @xmath69 time steps for steady - state flow to be fully established , so that the @xmath70 are free from startup effects ( for @xmath71 this remark needs to be qualified , see section  [ sec : ab1 ] ) .",
    "hence we discarded the first @xmath72 configurations when evaluating all quantities discussed in the following .",
    "as seen below in figures  [ fig : a2qbar ] ,  [ fig : q2q2bar ] , and  [ fig : aq2qbarab1 ] , the characteristic decay times for the @xmath73 , @xmath74 are about twice that , so the respective curves still show some crossover towards pure power - law behavior for the first @xmath75 time steps depicted .",
    "it is known  @xcite that , for @xmath76 the correlations between the operators representing particle and vacancy vanish , and they can be represented by @xmath77-numbers .",
    "one consequence of this is that the average current does not exhibit finite - size effects : @xmath78 for any system size .",
    "further simplifications occur , so that simple expressions can also be found for higher - order moments of the activity distribution  @xcite [ @xmath66which is not generally true for points elsewhere on the phase diagram , with the notable exception of @xmath42 deep inside the mc phase , see section  [ sec : ab1]@xmath66 ] .",
    "along @xmath76 we take one point , @xmath79 , representative of behavior deep inside the lc phase , and another , @xmath80 on the second - order transition line between lc and mc phases . in figure",
    "[ fig : a2qbar ] we present the evolution of @xmath81 and @xmath82 against time , for @xmath83 and @xmath80 . in both cases",
    "the variance initially increases faster than linearly with time , but eventually settles to a linear increase .",
    "also , both quantities behave identically for @xmath84 , @xmath85 , while for the special case @xmath86 they follow very close trends , the ratio @xmath87 starting at around @xmath88 and approaching unity as @xmath89 grows ( near the upper limit in the figure , it has reached @xmath90 ) .",
    "one sees that the dominant features of the second - order cumulants of @xmath91 essentially coincide with those of @xmath92 .",
    "as shown below , the quantitative description of @xmath93 cumulants , and of their associate skewness properties , always points to their absolute value being rather small ; at the level of accuracy pursued here the main issue therefore concerns their sign , which generally proves to be a robust feature ( i.e. , independent of whether @xmath91 or @xmath92 is the quantity under consideration ) .",
    "thus , in the following , we usually display only results for the @xmath94 , for comparison with the conventional @xmath95  .    in figure",
    "[ fig : q2q2bar ] we show the cumulants @xmath96 and @xmath97 against @xmath89 , for @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and for @xmath86  .    regarding data for @xmath96 in fig .",
    "[ fig : q2q2bar ] , for @xmath84 , @xmath85 the expected linear behavior against @xmath89 is present for the whole time interval shown . on the other hand , for",
    "@xmath86 one sees the anomalous scaling with @xmath98 , referred to above , over a wide time window up to @xmath99 .",
    "both types of power - law behavior have been reported in ref .",
    ", for the same two sets of values of @xmath100 . for the @xmath86 data , at longer times there is a crossover back towards linear scaling .",
    "anomalous scaling at @xmath86 has been explained in detail in ref .  .",
    "it can be understood by recalling that this point is on the second - order phase boundary separating low- and maximal - current phases ( see figure  [ fig : obc_pd ] ) .",
    "the associated diverging correlation length @xmath101 brings about a diverging relaxation time @xmath102 ( where @xmath103 is the kardar - parisi - zhang exponent known to describe tasep dynamics  @xcite ) which , in turn , governs the current - current correlation fluctuations and related quantities . for systems of finite size @xmath10",
    ", this regime holds only for @xmath104 , i.e. , the `` windows '' referred to earlier . in connection with eq .",
    "( [ eq : q2proptot ] ) , it can be seen that in this case , the assumption of @xmath105 fails over the window of anomalous scaling , but is then restored at longer times ; hence , the observed crossover towards linear behavior .",
    "going now to data for @xmath106 , one sees that they eventually merge with the respective @xmath96 curves . for @xmath86",
    "such merging happens , of course , at later times than the window of anomalous scaling .",
    "it was shown in ref .   that the activity pdf is a pure gaussian at this point ; here , as already remarked in connection with figure  [ fig : a2qbar ] , we see that @xmath106 does not capture the anomalous scaling behavior there , either .",
    "further information can be extracted from the pdfs , or full counting statistics , of the integrated currents .",
    "data for @xmath60 at @xmath107 are shown in figure  [ fig : qbarab05 ] as a scaling plot .",
    "although the effective scaling power is @xmath108 , which is in line with the linear dependence of @xmath106 against @xmath89 seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : q2q2bar ] , the scaled pdf shows a slight negative skew . for comparison ,",
    "figure  [ fig : qab05 ] shows the corresponding scaling plot for @xmath109 within the anomalous scaling window , where a negative skew is more clearly present ; however , the scaling power is now @xmath110 , as already remarked in ref .  .",
    "for a proper analysis of the scaled data shown in figures  [ fig : qbarab05 ] and  [ fig : qab05 ] , and comparison with theoretical predictions where available , one must keep in mind that the former necessarily pertain to finite @xmath89 and @xmath10 , while the latter either assume taking the @xmath111 limit  @xcite , or  @xcite @xmath10 is kept fixed and @xmath35 .    denoting by @xmath112 the scaling powers referred to",
    ", it turns out from the scaled variables @xmath113 [ @xmath114 and @xmath115 [ @xmath116 that the cumulants of the global [ @xmath66local@xmath66 ] current are given by @xmath117= t^{nk-1}\\,\\langle\\langle u^n\\rangle\\rangle$ ]  .",
    "so , for the global current ( @xmath118 ) , one can have both @xmath119 and @xmath120 finite for @xmath35 , while @xmath121 must vanish in the same limit , since @xmath122 must not diverge . by separately analyzing pdf data used in figure  [ fig : qbarab05 ] for various times @xmath123 we found that , as @xmath89 increases",
    ", @xmath124 increases from @xmath125 to @xmath126 , while @xmath121 goes from @xmath127 to @xmath128 .",
    "the `` diffusion constant '' @xmath120 can be compared with @xmath129 for @xmath64  @xcite .",
    "although there appears to be no _ a priori _ reason to assume equality of these quantities , the closeness of their values is remarkable .",
    "as regards @xmath121 , its evolution can be approximately matched by a @xmath130 dependence , which would be compatible with a nonzero limiting value for @xmath122 .",
    "for the local current ( @xmath131 ) , if @xmath132 then @xmath133 which is in line with existing results  @xcite , recalling that at @xmath134 : ( i ) @xmath135  @xcite , and ( ii ) the appropriate finite - size scaling combination is @xmath136 . also , @xmath45 should approach a finite value if @xmath121 is finite . from the full set of data in figure  [ fig : qbarab05 ] , we find @xmath137  .",
    "separate analysis of subsets of data for different times shows small fluctuations around the average just quoted , with no apparent up- or downward trend upon increasing @xmath89 .",
    "comparison of this estimate to the analytic prediction for the thermodynamic limit , @xmath138  @xcite shows that , though correct in sign , it is still only about @xmath139 of the expected value .    at @xmath83 , as evinced in figure  [ fig : q2q2bar ] , the scaling power is @xmath118 for both @xmath91 and @xmath140 .",
    "figure  [ fig : qqbara3b7 ] shows that the scaled pdfs for both quantities are nearly indistinguishable , even when one plots @xmath64 data for @xmath141 together with @xmath63 data for @xmath142 .",

    "allowing for non - zero skewness gives @xmath145 , with @xmath146 , and @xmath147 .",

    "several simplifications occur  @xcite , allowing for simple expressions to be derived for the @xmath152 , so we ran simulations at that point .",
    "figure  [ fig : aq2qbarab1 ] shows the time evolution of the variance of the several integrated quantities under investigation here .",
    "comparing with figures  [ fig : a2qbar ] and  [ fig : q2q2bar ] , which refer to the same system size and time interval , the main difference to the behavior exhibited at @xmath134 is in the anomalous scaling of @xmath153 .",
    "our best fit to single - power behavior , encompassing the same time `` window '' as used in that case , i.e. , @xmath154 , gives an exponent equal to @xmath155 , close to but slightly below the expected value , @xmath156 .",
    "the expected crossover to linear behavior , and merging with the @xmath157 curve , takes place in the same ( narrow ) time interval as at @xmath134 .",
    "the apparent discrepancy in the exponent value can be solved by examining the scaling plot of the pdf for @xmath140 , shown in figure  [ fig : qab1 ] , where the scaling power is set to @xmath110 .",
    "it can be seen that data collapse is rather good , except for the @xmath158 data which visibly stray off , especially at the low end of the curve .",
    "indeed , fitting only data for @xmath159 in figure  [ fig : aq2qbarab1 ] gives an exponent @xmath160 .",
    "so it is the extent of the @xmath98 scaling window which is shorter here than for @xmath134  .",
    "further analysis of the scaling plot depicted in figure  [ fig : qab1 ] follows the same lines as that of figure  [ fig : qab05 ] : ( i ) again , @xmath161 , with the same interpretation as above ; and ( ii ) the value of @xmath162 compares reasonably well to the analytic prediction , @xmath163  @xcite",

    "the quality of data collapse is not as good as for points at the border , or outside , of the maximal - current phase ( see , respectively , figures  [ fig : qbarab05 ] and  [ fig : qqbara3b7 ] ) .",

    "again , this compares favorably with @xmath165 for @xmath63  @xcite .",
    "the third cumulant is negative but very close to zero , @xmath166 .",
    "we have set out to compare the features exhibited by fluctuations of activity with those of ( local ) current for the tasep with open bcs .",
    "we define @xmath167 , with the systemwide ( instantaneous ) activity @xmath9 defined in eq .",

    "this indicates that the systemwide sampling at equal times overshadows the subtler effects which come about from non - equal time correlations , within the maximal - current phase and along its border .",
    "anomalous scaling can be unveiled only when the local current is considered , in which case systemwide , equal - time sampling is absent , and the system - size dependence is much less relevant overall ( although it still shows up in the width of the scaling `` window '' , see ref .",

    "going back to the skewness of distributions , the sign of @xmath170 is positive for @xmath179 , and negative otherwise , with the following exceptions : @xmath134 where @xmath180 , and @xmath42 , @xmath181 , and @xmath182 where @xmath183  @xcite . at @xmath184 , @xmath185 but depends on @xmath186 , as opposed to the @xmath21 form which holds generally in the low - current phase .",

    "evaluates @xmath193 at @xmath42 , as recalled in section  [ sec : ab1 ] , and gives arguments showing that the dominant behavior of the cumulants should be the same as that at @xmath42 everywhere within the maximal - current phase .    in conclusion ,",
    "once accidental exceptions are understood as such , both @xmath170 for activity and @xmath45 for the local current tell essentially the same story : fluctuation distributions have positive skew for low injection ( or ejection ) rates , and negative skew otherwise .",
    "the borderline between the two types of behavior lies deep within the low - current phase , and its relationship to the actual ( second - order ) transition to the maximal - current phase it at best that of a precursor .    as a final remark",
    ", we emphasize that accurate numerical checks of the theoretical predictions for @xmath45 would need much longer simulations than those reported here , since evaluation of this quantity strongly depends on a proper description of the tails of the local - current pdf .",
    "however , at the level of accuracy pursued here , the present results fulfil our goal of providing a comparative analysis of the main features of activity- and local - current fluctuations .",

    "<S> this indicates that the systemwide sampling at equal times , characteristic of the instantaneous activity , overshadows the subtler effects which come about from non - equal time correlations , and are responsible for anomalous scaling . </S>",
    "<S> we show that apparently conflicting results concerning asymmetry ( skewness ) of the corresponding distributions can in fact be reconciled , and that ( apart from a few well - understood exceptional cases ) for both activity and local current one has positive skew deep within the low - current phase , and negative skew everywhere else . </S>"
