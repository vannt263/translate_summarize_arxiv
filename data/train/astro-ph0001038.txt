    "clusters of galaxies are likely to be dynamically young systems and a promising way to constrain cosmological models arises from the study their substructures ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    among the methods suggested to quantify the degree of inhomogeneity in clusters ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , one of the most promising is based on the so - called _ power ratios _",
    "( @xcite , hereafter vgb99 ; @xcite ) .",
    "it amounts to a multipole expansion accounting for the angle dependence of cluster x  ray surface brightness , limited to the first few multipole terms and at fixed scales ( typically of the order of the mpc ) .",
    "this is an effective and synthetic way to discriminate cluster features and  are found do depend on the cosmological model enabling to discriminate among different cosmologies .",
    "the number of photons collected by rosat pspc does not depend on the temperature @xmath9 , if it is@xmath10 kev .",
    "we can then assume that the x  ray surface brightness @xmath11 . here",
    "@xmath12 results from an integration along the line of sight .",
    "the procedure to work out  is as follows ( see , e.g. , @xcite , hereafter g98 ; vgb99 ; @xcite ) : ( i ) @xmath13 is projected along a line of sight on a ( random ) plane to yield the @xmath14ray surface brightness @xmath15 ; the centroid is used as origin .",
    "( ii ) by solving the poisson equation @xmath16 we obtain the pseudo  potential @xmath17 .",
    "( iii ) the coefficients of the expansion of @xmath18 in plane harmonics will be used to build the power ratios @xmath19 . here",

    ", @xmath23 vanishes .",
    "we shall restrict our analysis to ( @xmath24 ) , to account for   on scales not much below @xmath25 itself .",
    "we consider three different aperture radii @xmath26mpc .",
    "because of its evolution , a cluster moves along a curve of the 3dimensional space spanned by such s ; this curve is called _ evolutionary track_. quite in general , a cluster starts from a configuration away from the origin , corresponding to a large amount of internal structure and evolves towards isotropization and homogeneization .    actual data , of course ,",
    "do not follow the motion of a given cluster along the evolutionary track .",
    "different clusters , however , lie at different redshifts and can be used to describe a succession of evolutionary stages .",
    "we consider three spatially flat cosmological models : cdm ,   with a cosmological constant accounting for @xmath27 of the critical density , and  with 1 massive neutrino with mass @xmath28ev , yielding a hdm density parameter @xmath29 .",
    "we set @xmath30 for cdm and  and @xmath31 for  ; for all models the primeval spectral index @xmath32 and the baryon density parameter is selected to give @xmath33 .",
    "all models were normalized in order to reproduce the present observed cluster abundance ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    in order to achieve a safe statistical basis for our analysis , for each cosmological model",
    ", we select the 40 most massive clusters from an n  body p3 m simulation . for each of them , we perform a hydrodynamical treesph simulation ( vgb99 , g98 ; see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "clusters are distributed in redshift so to reproduce the same redshfit distribution of the observed cluster sample .",
    "our observed data set is the same used by @xcite , including nearby ( @xmath34 ) clusters observed with rosat pspc instrument ( see vgb99 , g98 for details ) .",
    "the resulting sample is partially incomplete , but , clusters were not selected for reasons related to their morphology and the missing clusters are expected to have a distribution of power ratios similar to the observed one .",
    "for simulated clusters , power ratios  have been computed from the gas distribution .",
    "a visual inspection of how the  are distributed can be obtained from fig.1 , whose histograms show the fraction of clusters with a given  . here",
    "we show the distribution for @xmath35 and @xmath36mpc for each cosmological model and for the rosat data sample ; distributions for the other  and the other apertures show a similar behavior    quite in general we can conclude that while cdm and   are marginally consistent with data ,    is far below them . in order to quantify these differences , we used the student t  test , the f  test and the kolgomorov  smirnov ( ks ) test .",
    "for example , according to the t ",
    "test , the probability @xmath37@xmath38 that the simulated and observed power ratios distributions are originated from the same process is roughly in the ranges 0.110.60 for cdm , 0.030.37 for and 0.15@xmath390.87@xmath40 for  .",
    "the other statistical tests provide similar probabilities .",
    "such figures seem to exclude that   can be considered a reasonable approximation to data .",
    "the best score belongs to cdm , but also  is not fully excluded and different mixtures could certainly have better performance .",
    "an inspection of the model clusters actually shows that the    model does produce less substructures than the other models do .",
    "a possible interpretation of such output is that the actual amount of substructures is governed by @xmath41 rather than by the shape of power spectra .    according to the same tests ,",
    "if cosmological models are compared with data on the basis of dm , values are shifted , indicating an increase in the amount of substructures for dm with respect to the gas .",
    "this is to be ascribed to the smoothing effects of the interactions among gas particles , which erase anisotropies and structures , while dm scarcely feel dissipative processes .",
    "hence , using dm leads to biased scores : cdm and  models keep too many substructures and are no longer consistent with data ; on the contrary , the increase of substructures pushes   to agree with rosat sample outputs .",
    "we also considered the cluster distribution in the 3dimensional parameter space with axes given by  ( @xmath24 ) , as well as projections of such distributions on planes .",
    "comparing such distributions for data and models , we find a significantly stronger correlation of  in models than in data .",
    "distributions for simulated clusters show a linear trend while distributions of observed clusters tend to be more scattered than simulated points .",
    "the degree of correlation depends on the model , but seems however in disagreement with data .",
    "model clusters tend to indicate a significantly faster evolution than data . the cosmological model which seems closest to data is  and it is possible that different  mixtures can lead to further improvements .",
    "also @xmath4 models with @xmath42 might deserve to be explored .",
    "virialized clusters had their turn  around at a time @xmath43 ( @xmath44 : present age of the universe ) . in turn",
    ", @xmath45 becomes dominant at @xmath46 .",
    "if such redshift occurs at a time @xmath47 , we expect results from @xmath48 models to be closer to observations ."
