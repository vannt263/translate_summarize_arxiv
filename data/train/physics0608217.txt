    "continuous time random walks ( ctrws ) were introduced in physics by montroll and weiss as a model for single - particle ( tracer ) diffusion @xcite .",
    "an instance of ctrw , the normal compound poisson process , had already been used in the probabilistic theory of insurance ruin since the beginning of the xxth century @xcite .",
    "the seminal paper of montroll and weiss has been followed by many studies focusing on anomalous relaxation and anomalous diffusion .",
    "this is the subject of two recent reviews by metzler and klafter @xcite .",
    "the present author has recently reviewed the applications of ctrws to finance and economics @xcite .",
    "these applications were triggered by a series of papers on finance and fractional calculus @xcite , but the reader is referred to ref .",
    "@xcite for an early application of the normal compound poisson process to financial data .",
    "the recent research of the present author has focused on the behaviour of waiting times ( also known as durations ) between trades and order in financial markets @xcite .",
    "it turned out that interorder and intertrade waiting times are not exponentially distributed .",
    "therefore , the jump process of tick - by - tick prices is non - markovian @xcite .    in an article within this issue @xcite ,",
    "bianco and grigolini apply a new method to verify whether the intertrade waiting time process is a genuine renewal process @xcite .",
    "this was assumed by the ctrw hypothesis in @xcite .",
    "they find that intertrade waiting times follow a renewal process .    here , inspired by the work of edelman and gillespie @xcite , a phenomenological model for intraday tick - by - tick financial data is presented .",
    "it is able to reproduce some important stylized facts .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 contains an outline of the theory of ctrws .",
    "section 3 contains a description of the model as well as a discussion on results from monte carlo simulations .",
    "ctrws are point processes with reward .",
    "the point process is characterized by a sequence of independent identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "positive random variables @xmath0 , which can be interpreted as waiting times between two consecutive events : @xmath1 the rewards are i.i.d . not necessarily positive random variables : @xmath2 . in the usual physical intepretation , they represent the jumps of a random walker , and they can be @xmath3-dimensional vectors . in this paper , only the 1-dimensional case is studied for a continuous random variable , but the extension of many results to the @xmath3-dimensional case and to a lattice is straightforward . the position @xmath4 of the walker at time @xmath5 is ( with @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) : @xmath8 ctrws are rather good and general phenomenological models for diffusion , including anomalous diffusion , provided that the time of residence of the walker is much greater than the time it takes to make a jump . in fact , in this formalism , jumps are instantaneous .",
    "the financial interpretation of the random variables is straightforward .",
    "if trades take place in a continuous double auction , both price variations and waiting times ( also called durations ) between two consecutive trades are random variables .",
    "if @xmath9 is the price of an asset at time @xmath5 defined according to the previous tick interpolation procedure , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the time instant at which the last trade took place , then the price process can be considered as a pure jump stochastic process in continuous time . in finance , it is better to work with returns rather that prices .",
    "if @xmath12 is the price at time @xmath13 , then the variable @xmath14 is called the _ log - return _ or , better , the _ log - price_. this variable is analogous to the position of the walker in the physical interpretation . in the financial intepretation",
    "the jump random variables @xmath2 are tick - by - tick log returns and they coincide with the difference between two consecutive log prices , whereas the waiting times or durations @xmath0 denote the elapsed time between two consecutive trades .",
    "in general , jumps and waiting times are not independent from each other . in any case , a ctrw is characterized by the joint probability density @xmath15 of jumps and waiting times ; @xmath16 is the probability of a jump to be in the interval @xmath17 and of a waiting time to be in the interval @xmath18 .",
    "the following integral equation gives the probability density , @xmath19 , for the walker being in position @xmath4 at time @xmath5 , conditioned on the fact that it was in position @xmath20 at time @xmath13 : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the so - called survival function .",
    "@xmath22 is related to the marginal waiting - time probability density @xmath23 .",
    "the two marginal densities @xmath23 and @xmath24 are : @xmath25 and the survival function @xmath22 is defined as : @xmath26    the integral equation , eq .",
    "( [ masterequation ] ) is linear and it can be solved in the laplace - fourier domain .",
    "the laplace transform , @xmath27 of a ( generalized ) function @xmath28 is defined as : @xmath29 whereas the fourier transform of a ( generalized ) function @xmath30 is defined as : @xmath31 a generalized function is a distribution ( like dirac s @xmath32 ) in the sense of s. l. sobolev and l. schwartz @xcite .",
    "one gets : @xmath33 or , in terms of the density @xmath23 : @xmath34 as , from eq .",
    "( [ survival ] ) , one has : @xmath35 in order to obtain @xmath19 , it is then necessary to invert its laplace - fourier transform @xmath36 .",
    "analytic solutions are quite important , as they provide a benchmark for testing numerical inversion methods . in the next section ,",
    "an explicit analytic solution for a class of continuous - time random walks with anomalous relaxation behaviour will be presented .",
    "it will be necessary to restrict oneself to the uncoupled case , in which jumps and waiting - times are not correlated .      in this section , the solution of eq .",
    "( [ masterequation ] ) will be derived in the uncoupled case where the joint probability density of jumps and durations can be factorized in term of its marginals .",
    "after the derivation of a genearal formula for @xmath19 , this will be specialized to the case of the normal compound poisson process ( ncpp ) .",
    "if jump sizes do not depend on waiting times , the joint probability density for jumps and waiting times can be written as follows : @xmath37 with the normalization conditions @xmath38 and @xmath39 .    in this case",
    "the integral master equation for @xmath19 becomes : @xmath40\\,dt'\\ ] ] this equation has a well known general explicit solution in terms of @xmath41 , the probability of @xmath3 jumps occurring up to time @xmath5 , and of the @xmath3-fold convolution of the jump density ,",
    "@xmath42 : @xmath43 indeed , @xmath41 is given by : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the @xmath3-fold convolution of the waiting - time density : @xmath46 the @xmath3-fold convolutions defined above are probability density functions for the sum of @xmath3 variables .",
    "the laplace transform of @xmath41 , @xmath47 , reads : @xmath48^n \\widetilde \\psi(s)\\ ] ] by taking the fourier - laplace transform of eq .",
    "( [ uncoupledreal ] ) , one gets : @xmath49 but , recalling that @xmath50 and @xmath51 , if @xmath52 and @xmath53 , eq . ( [ montroll ] ) becomes : @xmath54^n \\,;\\ ] ] this gives , inverting the fourier and the laplace transforms and taking into account eqs .",
    "( [ jumpconv ] ) and ( [ poisson1 ] ) : @xmath55 eq .",
    "( [ series2 ] ) can also be used as the starting point to derive eq .",
    "( [ uncoupledreal ] ) via the transforms of fourier and laplace , as it describes a jump process subordinated to a renewal process .",
    "a remarkable analytic solution is available when the waiting - time probability density function has the following exponential form : @xmath56 then , the survival probability is @xmath57 and the probability of @xmath3 jumps occurring up to time @xmath5 is given by the poisson distribution : @xmath58 this is the only markovian case , and equation ( [ series2 ] ) becomes : @xmath59 if @xmath24 follows the normal distribution @xmath60 , then the n - fold convolution is given by : @xmath61 .",
    "given a series of empirical tick - by - tick log returns , @xmath62 , as well as durations , @xmath63 , one can directly evaluate the three parameters @xmath64 : the activity of the poisson process , @xmath65 : the average of log - returns , and @xmath66 : the standard deviation of log - returns by means of suitable estimators @xcite .",
    "however , the normal compound poisson process is not able to reproduce the following stylized facts on high frequency data :    1 .",
    "the empirical distribution of log - returns is leptokurtic , whereas the ncpp assumes a mesokurtic ( actually normal ) distribution .",
    "the empirical distribution of durations is non - exponential with excess standard deviation @xcite , whereas the ncpp assumes an exponential distribution .",
    "the autocorrelation of absolute log - returns decays slowly @xcite , whereas the ncpp assumes i.i.d .",
    "log - returns .",
    "log - returns and waiting times are not independent @xcite , whereas the ncpp assumes their independence .",
    "volatility and activity vary during the trading day @xcite , whereas the ncpp assumes they are constant .",
    "it is possible to overcome the above shortcomings by using a suitable mixture of ncpps . during a trading day , the volatility and the activity are higher at the opening of the market , then they decrease at midday and they increase again at market closure @xcite . if the trading day can be divided into @xmath67 intervals of constant activity @xmath68 , then the waiting - time distribution is a mixture of exponential distributions and its probability density can be written as : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is a set of suitable weights .",
    "the activity seasonality can be mimicked by values of @xmath71 that decrease towards midday and then increase again towards market closure . in order to reproduce the correlation between volatility and activity , one can assume that : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a suitable constant . future work will be devoted to an analytical study of this model as well as to further empirical investigations on model validation .",
    "below , the results of a simulation performed with the model are presented , and the performance of the model with respect to the stylized facts is discussed .",
    "a monte carlo simulation of the model described in the previous subsection has been performed by considering a trading day divided into ten intervals of constant activity with @xmath74 = @xmath75 , @xmath76 s@xmath77 . for each value of @xmath71 ,",
    "100 exponentially distributed waiting times have extracted as well as 100 normally distributed log - returns with zero average and @xmath78",
    ". therefore , there are 1000 values of waiting times and log returns in a trading day , representing a rather liquid share .",
    "the opening price is set to 100 arbitrary units ( a.u . ) . in fig .",
    "1 , a sample path is plotted for the price as a function of trading time . fig . 2 and fig .",
    "3 represent the tick - by - tick time series of log - returns and waiting times respectively . for this particular simulation",
    ", the effect of variable activity and volatility can be detected by direct eye inspection .    in order to show that this model is able to reproduce the stylized facts described above , another set of figures",
    "is presented in the following . in fig .",
    "4 the empirical complementary cumulative distribution function is plotted for absolute tick - by - tick log returns . for comparison , the gaussian fit with the same standard deviation of the 1000 log - returns is given by a solid line .",
    "this distribution has fat tails , is leptokurtic and the kurtosis is equal to 6 .    the empirical complementary cumulative distribution function for intertrade durations is given in fig .",
    "the solid line is the single exponential fit to the simulated data .",
    "there is excess standard deviation : the standard deviation of waiting times is 29 s , whereas the average waiting time is 25 s.    fig .",
    "6 shows the slow decay of the autocorrelation of absolute log - returns related to volatility clustering , whereas signed log - returns are zero already at the second lag .    in conclusion ,",
    "the model based on mixtures of normal compound poisson processes incorporates variable daily activity , as well as the dependence between durations and tick - by - tick log - returns via eq .",
    "( [ corrvolact ] ) .",
    "it is then able to replicate the following stylized facts :    * the empirical distribution of log - returns is leptokurtic ; * the empirical distribution of durations is non - exponential with excess standard deviation ; * the autocorrelation of absolute log - returns decays slowly .",
