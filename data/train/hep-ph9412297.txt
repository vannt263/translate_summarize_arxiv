    "it is a pleasure to recall the ideas that led to the first supersymmetric unified theory and its low energy manifestation , the supersymmetric @xmath0 model .",
    "this theory synthesizes two marvelous ideas , unification @xcite and supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "the synthesis is catalyzed by the hierarchy problem @xcite which suggests that supersymmetry occurs at accessible energies @xcite . since time is short and we are explicitly asked to talk about",
    "_ our own _",
    "contributions i will not cover these important topics .    a look at the the program of this conference reveals that most other topics covered are textbook subjects , such as renormalization of the standard model @xcite and asymptotic freedom @xcite , that are at the foundation of our field .",
    "so it is natural to ask why supersymmetric unification is included in such a distinguished company of well - established subjects ?",
    "i am not certain .",
    "perhaps the main reason at present is a quantitative * prediction * , dating from 1981 , that has been verified by high precision data ( see figure ) ; that is a correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath2 which has been confirmed by experiment at the 1% level @xcite .",
    "in fact this is the only significant _ quantitative _ success of any extension of the standard model , and is the strongest experimental hint that we have for physics beyond the standard model .",
    "the correlation in the values of @xmath2 and @xmath1 predicted in susy - guts and ordinary guts .",
    "the bare superstring prediction is the point on the far right .",
    "the present 1994 data are contrasted with the 1981 data .",
    "the bands are the uncertainties in the theoretical predictions of guts and susy - guts .",
    "the numbers in the bands indicate the unification scale .",
    "the uncertainties in the theoretical predictions for superstrings are not known .",
    "it is amusing that this prediction of the weak mixing angle , at the time it was made , disagreed with experiment @xcite ( see figure ) .",
    "experiments since then , especially the recent lep results , have convincingly changed the experimental world average in favor of the prediction .",
    "the success of this prediction depends crucially on having both unification * and * low energy supersymmetry in the same theory ; either unification or supersymmetry alone are insufficient .",
    "so , although we have not seen any superparticles yet , we have evidence for superunification",
    "!    we will discuss the developments in chronological order , beginning with the state of our field before 1981 .",
    "a crucial turning point in our field occurred in the spring of 1978 .",
    "the slac experiment on parity violation in neutral currents convinced many theorists that the standard model of glashow , weinberg and salam was correct and that it was a good time to start focusing on the next layer of questions : to explain some of the puzzling features of the standard model .",
    "the first question that theorists turned to was the `` hierarchy problem '' @xcite : attempting to understand why the higgs mass is so much smaller than the planck mass or the unification scale .",
    "the higgs does not carry any symmetry that ensures its lightness ; indeed , in the absence of miraculous cancellations , the higgs mass would be driven to the planck or unification scale ; it would not be available at low energies to do its intended job of giving mass to the weak gauge bosons .",
    "susskind and weinberg @xcite proposed the very appealing idea of technicolor , as an alternative to the higgs , for giving mass to the weak gauge bosons . in early 79 technicolor",
    "was enlarged into `` extended technicolor '' @xcite to allow the quarks and leptons to get their masses . by the summer of 1980",
    "it became clear that these theories suffered from generic problems of flavor violations @xcite that could perhaps be cured only by complicating the theory immensely and losing any hope of calculability .",
    "i , perhaps prematurely , felt that this was too high a price to pay and decided to look at other alternative approaches to the hierarchy problem .",
    "that is when we turned to supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "it was generally realized that supersymmetry could help the hierarchy problem @xcite .",
    "the reason is that the higgs , a scalar , would form a degenerate pair with a fermion , called the higgsino .",
    "since the higgsino could be protected by a chiral symmetry from becoming superheavy , so could its degenerate scalar partner , the higgs .",
    "of course supersymmetry does much more than to just relate the higgs to the higgsino .",
    "it assigns a degenerate scalar `` superpartner '' to each and every known quark and lepton , as well as a fermionic degenerate superpartner to each gauge boson .",
    "since no such particles had been seen it was clear that supersymmetry had to be a broken symmetry .",
    "nevertheless , supersymmetry would still help the hierarchy problem as long as its breaking occurs near the weak scale , the superpartners are at accessible energies ! this line of reasoning led us to begin our attempt to find a supersymmetric version of the standard model with supersymmetry broken at the weak scale .",
    "together with stuart raby and leonard susskind we started learning about supersymmetry and tried to find out if such theories had already been constructed .",
    "we quickly discovered that no supersymmetric versions of the standard model existed at that time .",
    "there were early attempts by fayet @xcite that were plagued by the following problems :    * they were * not * supersymmetric extensions of the standard @xmath0 model .",
    "the gauge group was @xmath3 . without the extra @xmath4 neutral current interactions , the theory had phenomenological problems : it spontaneously violated electric charge and color conservation . *",
    "the extra neutral current @xmath4 was anomalous . to get a consistent theory one had to cancel the anomalies by introducing extra light particles , distinct from the ordinary quarks and leptons .",
    "these again led to color and electric charge breaking at the weak scale : the photon had a mass @xmath5 .",
    "the root of these problems was that in these theories supersymmetry was broken spontaneously at the tree level . in 1979 a very important paper by ferrara , girardello and palumbo @xcite showed that in such theories , under very general conditions , color and charged scalars would get negative masses squared , leading to breaking of electric charge and color .",
    "this essentially stopped efforts to build realistic supersymmetric theories .    during the fall of 1980 these difficulties often caused us to wonder whether we were not on the wrong track and supersymmetry was doomed to fail in the real world , at least as a low energy phenomenon . almost nothing that we tried worked .",
    "we could not cancel the anomalies of the extra @xmath4 without giving a mass @xmath5 to the photon and gluon .",
    "the extra @xmath4 made it impossible to unify , which is important for addressing the hierarchy problem and for predicting @xmath2 .",
    "we also had no clue as to what to do with the continuous r - symmetry that implied massless gluinos .",
    "little of what we learned during these early exercises has survived .",
    "the benefit was that we learned bits of the mathematical formalism which told us , loud and clear , that all known particles have superpartners and how these couple forced the number of doublets to be 2 @xcite . ]",
    ". however , given all the problems , it was unclear that anything that we learned would survive .    since the origin of these problems was that supersymmetry",
    "was broken spontaneously , it seemed clear to us that we should look for alternate mechanisms to break supersymmetry .",
    "at first , we attempted to break supersymmetry dynamically with a new strong force , very similar to technicolor , which we called supercolor .",
    "we were not alone in these efforts .",
    "witten @xcite as well as dine , fischler and srednicki @xcite were pursuing similar ideas for precisely the same reasons .",
    "they wrote two very important papers entitled `` dynamical breaking of supersymmetry ' ' ( witten ) and `` supersymmetric technicolor '' ( dine , fischler and srednicki ) .",
    "their preprints appeared in april of 81 at the same time as our `` supercolor '' paper @xcite .",
    "an essential objective of these works was to point out that low energy supersymmetry helps the hierarchy problem , and to argue that a new strong force analogous to qcd or technicolor may induce the breaking of supersymmetry and explain the smallness of the electroweak scale .",
    "dine , fischler and srednicki , as well as raby and myself , also attempted to build explicit models incorporating these ideas , but without much success .",
    "i do not have time to discuss these `` supercolor '' or `` supersymmetric technicolor '' theories .",
    "they had problems ; one of them was that they were baroque .",
    "by january of 1981 we were very discouraged .",
    "although stuart raby and i had begun writing the supercolor paper @xcite , we already did not believe in it .",
    "it seemed too much to believe that nature would make simultaneous use of supersymmetry * and * technicolor to solve the hierarchy problem .",
    "in january of 1981 the prospects for a realistic supersymmetric model were not bright .",
    "models with spontaneusly broken supersymmetry had grave phenomenological problems .",
    "dynamical supersymmetry breaking models were at best baroque . _",
    "the prevailing view was that a realistic supersymmetric model would not be found until the problem of supersymmetry breaking was solved .",
    "it was further believed that the experimental consequences of supersymmetric theories would strongly depend on the details of the mechanism of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "_ after all , it was this mechanism that caused the phenomenological disasters of the early attempts .",
    "the key that took us out of this dead end grew out of our protracted frustration with the above problems , and our desire to do physics with the idea of superunification .",
    "these  quite suddenly  led us to switch problems , adopt a more phenomenological approach and simply assume that the dynamics that breaks supersymmetry is external to and commutes with the ordinary @xmath0 sector ; specifically , we postulated that :    1 .   the only particles carrying @xmath0 quantum numbers are the ordinary ones and their superpartners that reside at the weak scale . extra particles with exotic @xmath6 quantum numbers are unnecessary .",
    "the ordinary particles and their superpartners do not carry any extra new gauge interactions at low energies .",
    "this is essential for su(5 ) unification .",
    "the sole effect of the supersymmetry breaking mechanism is to lift the masses of the supersymmetric partners of all ordinary particles to the weak scale .",
    "these hypotheses helped us sidestep the obstacles that stood in the way of unifying and doing physics in the ordinary @xmath6 sector , the domain of experimental physics ! the question of the origin of supersymmetry breaking had been circumvented ; a good thing , since this question continues to remain open .",
    "these hypotheses started bearing fruits immediately .",
    "in this paper @xcite we computed the unification mass when you have a minimal supersymmetric particle content .",
    "we found that , because the superpartners of the gauge bosons slow down the evolution of the couplings , the unification mass increased to about @xmath7 gev .",
    "this was interesting for two reasons :    * this value is close to the planck mass , perhaps suggesting eventual unity with gravity . ] .",
    "* there was a distinct experimental difference with ordinary @xmath8 : the proton lifetime was unobservably long .",
    "the latter appeared to be an easily disprovable prediction .",
    "in fact by that time three different experimental groups had reported preliminary proton decay `` candidate events '' : the kolar gold field , homestake mine and the witwatersrand experiments .",
    "we knew that s.miyake , of the kolar gold field experiment , and possibly representatives of the other experiments were going to talk about their events in the upcoming `` second workshop on grand unification '' where i was also going to present our theoretical results .",
    "so , i was a bit nervous but did not hesitate for a moment to present them .",
    "i was , and still am , very proud of this paper . a simple and well motivated ingredient , virtual superparticles , made a huge difference to a quantity that was being measured at that time , the proton lifetime .",
    "perhaps this is the first test that susy - guts have passed . in this paper , although we pointed out that the value of @xmath2 would change due to the higgs sparticles , we did not present the new value . after satisfying ourselves that it would not be grossly modified , we focused on the change in the unification mass , which at that time was more important for experiment .",
    "the next big step was to construct a realistic supersymmetric theory .",
    "these two papers @xcite titled `` softly broken supersymmetry and su(5 ) '' and `` supersymmetric guts '' accomplished three objectives :    1 .   * supersymmetric unification ( susy - guts ) : * construction of a unified supersymmetric theory of strong and electroweak forces .",
    "our gauge group was su(5 ) .",
    "this was not really much harder than building a non - unified theory .",
    "unification was also essential for the prediction of @xmath2 and for some of the phenomenology , such as proton decay and gaugino masses .",
    "it was also a good framework for addressing the hierarchy problem .",
    "* supersymmetry breaking : * supersymmetry was broken softly but explicitly by mass terms for all scalar superpartners and gauginos .",
    "the origin of supersymmetry breaking was not specified .",
    "as long as it is external to and commutes with @xmath0 it does not matter for experiment .",
    "ingenious ideas for generating these soft terms by either new gauge forces @xcite , or via supergravity @xcite were proposed a year later .",
    "3 .   * supersymmetric standard model ( ssm ) : * as a bonus , our theory contained the first phenomenologically viable supersymmetric extension of the standard @xmath9 model ( ssm ) .",
    "we constructed the model in late march and early april of 1981 .",
    "we were overjoyed .",
    "we had the first realistic supersymmetric theory , incorporating all non - gravitational phenomena and valid up to the planck mass .",
    "we immediately started thinking about experimental consequences .",
    "we wanted to make sure that we would not miss anything important .",
    "time pressure helped us a lot .",
    "both howard and i were scheduled to give two consecutive talks in the second workshop on grand unification which took place at the university of michigan on april 24 - 26 , 1981 . here",
    "are some of our phenomenological results that we reported in that workshop @xcite :    * * @xmath2 :* we presented our susy - gut prediction for @xmath2 .",
    "the magnitude we got disagreed with the central experimental value , but the errors were large .",
    "we argued that there would have to be 2 higgs doublets for the value not to be too far off . * * proton decay * : we reported that the supersymmetric unification mass is so large @xcite that proton decay is unobservably small .",
    "* * superparticle spectroscopy : squarks and sleptons . *",
    "we postulated that all squarks and sleptons have a common universal mass ( @xmath5 ) at the unification scale .",
    "this way we had a super - gim mechanism supressing flavor violations .",
    "the higgses had different masses . * * superparticle spectroscopy : gauginos . * because we had a unified theory all gauginos had a common majorana mass ( @xmath5 ) at the unification scale . *",
    "* family reflection symmetry ; stable lsp .",
    "* to avoid rapid proton decay via dimension - four operators we postulated a discrete symmetry forbidding three - family couplings .",
    "this symmetry was subsequently called family reflection symmetry@xcite or matter parity .",
    "we concluded : + _ `` the lightest of the supersymmetric particles is stable .",
    "the others decay into it plus ordinary particles .",
    "one simple possibility is that it is the u(1 ) gauge fermion . '' _",
    "it is gratifying that the above ingredients have survived the test of time .",
    "they form the basis of what is now called the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "perhaps the most important conclusion of our paper is also the one that now seems so evident because it has , with time , been incorporated into our thinking :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ `` the phenomenology of the model is simple .",
    "in addition to the usual light matter fermions , gauge bosons and higgs bosons , we predict heavy matter bosons , gauge fermions and higgs fermions as supersymmetric partners .",

    "georgi and i spoke on the last day of the conference @xcite .",
    "my feeling was that our results were for the most part ignored , especially by the experimentalists who did not care about the hierarchy problem .",
    "our conclusions were very much against the spirit of the conference .",

    "they attempted to construct models with an extra @xmath4 gauge group that would forbid the dimension five operators that mediated proton decay .",

    "* hidden sector : * the theoretical question of how supersymmetry is broken and superparticle masses are generated in our theory attracted a lot of attention .",
    "georgi and i had spent a couple of days thinking about this and then decided that it was not phenomenologically interesting : _ two different theories of supersymmetry breaking that give precisely the same soft masses to the superpartners of ordinary particles can not be experimentally distinguished_. so we abandoned it .",
    "our philosophy was to build an effective theory that describes the @xmath8 part of supersymmetric world , which _ is _ accessible to experiment .",
    "it could result from many different ways of breaking supersymmetry , as long as the postulates of section 3.1 are satisfied .",
    "nevertheless , it was important to present at least an existence proof of a mechanism that generated our soft terms .",
    "an important consideration was that squarks and sleptons belonging to different generations had to have identical masses to avoid problems with rare processes @xcite . in the winter / spring of 82 three different groups @xcite ,",
    "dine and fischler , raby and i , and polchinski and susskind came up with the idea of a hidden sector , around @xmath13 gev , where supersymmetry breaking originates and is subsequently communicated to the ordinary particles via a new gauge interaction at the unification scale . soon afterwards a series of very important papers developed a better idea for such a mechanism : supersymmetry breaking could be communicated from the hidden sector via supergravity @xcite .",
    "* radiative electroweak breaking : * hidden sector mechanisms for supersymmetry breaking , under very special assumptions , give degenerate masses to all scalars : squarks , sleptons as well as higgses .",
    "this is good for avoiding flavor violations @xcite but poses the puzzle : what distinguishes the higgs from the squarks and the sleptons ?",
    "why does the higgs get a vacuum expectation value and not the squarks ? .",
    "starting with ibaez and ross , a series of very important papers @xcite developed the idea of radiative electroweak breaking which answers this question dynamically provided the top quark is sufficiently heavy , above @xmath14 gev .",
    "the title of this section is misleading .",
    "the picture is still very far from complete ; many fundamental questions remain unanswered .",
    "the theory we have is definitely * not * a theory of everything .",
    "instead , it is a phenomenological , disprovable theory that allows us to make contact with experiment in spite of the questions that it fails to address .",
    "in the last few minutes i want to take a break from history and mention some contemporary issues .",
    "the experimental values for @xmath2 and @xmath1 are contrasted with the predictions of three theories : ordinary guts , susy - guts and bare superstrings . under each prediction we list the number of standard deviations that it differs from experiment .",
    "guts and susy - guts predict one of either @xmath2 or @xmath1 ; the other one is an input . for strings",

    "we summarize the results in the table and the figure which together with their captions tell the story .",
    "the estimated uncertainties in the theoretical predictions for susy - guts and guts are due to : @xmath1 and @xmath15 error bars , sparticle thresholds , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , gut thresholds and non - renormalizable operators at the unification scale . for the @xmath2 prediction they all add up to about @xmath18",

    "the other uncertainties are significantly smaller .",
    "the threshold corrections are proportional to @xmath22s times logarithms of mass ratios .",

    "we learn that the supersymmetric threshold corrections are typically small .",
    "the same holds for the high energy threshold corrections in minimal susy ",
    "guts @xcite .",
    "therefore the @xmath33 prediction is quite insensitive to the details of both the low and the high mass - scale physics ; it takes a number of highly split multiplets to change it appreciably .",
    "for example , we know that to bring @xmath33 down by just @xmath34  back to the standard su(5 ) value  we would need to lift the higgsinos and the second higgs to @xmath35 .",
    "the flip side of these arguments show that to `` fix '' standard guts , you also need several highly split multiplets @xcite .",
    "in fact you need many more , since you do not have superpartners .",

    "worse yet , the proton decays too fast .",
    "do these problems mean that all non - supersymmetric guts are excluded ?",

    "for example , if you only allow 10% fine tunings then the two lightest neutralinos and chargino would be accessible at lep 200 .",
    "obviously , sparticle masses are proportional to the susy breaking scale . in contrast",
