    "in this paper , we address the problem of how to determine `` simple '' approximations of semialgebraic sets in euclidean space , and we show how these approximations can be exploited to address several problems of interest in systems and control .",
    "to be more precise , given a set @xmath1 which is compact , with non - empty interior and described by given real multivariate polynomials @xmath2 , and a compact set @xmath3 , we aim at determining a so - called _ polynomial superlevel set _ ( pss ) @xmath4 that constitutes a good outer approximation of the set @xmath5 of interest and converges strongly to @xmath5 when increasing the degree of the real multivariate polynomial @xmath6 to be found .    in particular , the proposed pss is based on an easily computable polynomial approximation of the indicator function of the set @xmath5 . in the paper , we show that suitable approximations of the indicator function can be obtained by solving a convex optimization problem whose constraints are linear matrix inequalities ( lmis ) and that , as the degree of the approximation increases , one converges in @xmath7-norm , almost uniformly and almost everywhere to the indicator function of the semialgebraic set @xmath5 of interest .",
    "moreover , the set approximations provided in this paper can be thought as a direct generalization of classical ellipsoidal set approximations , in the sense that if second degree approximations are used , we exactly recover well - known approaches .",
    "the main motivation for the problem addressed in the paper is the fact that semialgebraic sets are frequently encountered in control . as an example , consider the hurwitz or schur stability regions of a polynomial .",
    "it is a well - known fact that the these regions are semialgebraic sets in the coefficient space .",
    "the polynomial inequalities that define these stability sets can be derived from well - known algebraic stability criteria .",
    "another classical example of semialgebraic sets arising in control are lmi feasibility sets , also called spectrahedra",
    ". indeed , lmi sets are ( convex ) basic semialgebraic sets . to see this , consider the lmi set @xmath8 where the matrix @xmath9 has size @xmath10 , and observe that a vector @xmath11 belongs to @xmath12 if and only if all the coefficients of the univariate polynomial @xmath13 are nonnegative , i.e. @xmath11 belongs to the set @xmath5 is defined in ( [ k - set ] ) , where the polynomials @xmath14 are by construction sums of principal minors of the matrix @xmath9 .",
    "the approach taken in this paper is the following : given the set @xmath5 , we search for a minimum volume pss that contains the set @xmath5 .",
    "since there is in general no analytic formula for the volume of a semialgebraic set , in terms of the coefficients of the polynomials defining the set , it is very challenging to solve this optimization problem locally , let alone globally .",
    "instead , the main contribution of this paper is to describe and justify analytically and geometrically a computationally tractable heuristic based on or trace minimization .",
    "second , we show that the same approach can be employed to obtain the largest ( in terms of the @xmath7 surrogate for the volume ) pss inscribed in @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , it is shown how the ideas put forth in this paper can be used to address two important problems : i ) reconstruction / approximation of a ( possibly non - semialgebraic ) set from samples belonging to it , and ii ) uniform generation of samples distributed over a semialgebraic set",
    ". examples of applications in a systems analysis and controller design context are also provided .",
    "the work presented in this paper is an extension of the preliminary results in the conference papers  @xcite and  @xcite , and it provides a more in depth analysis of both theoretical and implementation aspects . in particular , with respect to  @xcite , the present manuscript contains more detailed proofs of the theoretical results , provides detailed algorithmic descriptions , and introduces inner pss approximations .",
    "similarly , the results on random sample generation of  @xcite are here described in more details , and an algorithm is provided .",
    "finally , all examples in the paper are new , and more control oriented applications are considered .",
    "the idea of approximating overly complicated sets by introducing simpler and easy manageable geometrical shapes is surely not new , it has a very long history , and it arises in different research fields such as optimization , system identification and control . in particular , in the systems and control community , the most common approach is to introduce _ outer bounding sets _ , that is sets of minimum size which are guaranteed to contain the set to be approximated .",
    "for instance , in the context of robust filtering , set - theoretic state estimators for uncertain nonlinear dynamic systems have been proposed in @xcite .",
    "these strategies adopt a set - membership approach @xcite , and construct ( the smallest ) compact set guaranteed to bound the system states that are consistent with the measured output and the norm - bounded uncertainty . the most common geometrical shape adopted in these work",
    "is the ellipsoidal one , for the double reason that it has a very simple description  the center and the shape matrix are sufficient to provide a complete characterization  and that its determination usually can be formulated as a convex ( usually quadratic ) optimization problem .",
    "the use of ellipsoidal sets in the state estimation problems was introduced in the pioneering work @xcite and used by many different authors from then on ; see , for example , @xcite .",
    "outer approximation also arise in the context of robust fault detection problems ( e.g. , see @xcite ) and of reachability analysis of nonlinear and/or hybrid systems @xcite .",
    "similarly , _ inner _",
    "approximations are employed in nonlinear programming @xcite , in the solution of design centering problems @xcite and for fixed - order controller design @xcite . in this case , one aims at constructing the set largest size inscribed in the set of interest .    besides ellipsoids , other shapes have been considered in the recent literature .",
    "the use of polyhedrons was proposed in @xcite to obtain an increased estimation accuracy , while zonotopes have been also recently studied in @xcite . in @xcite a heuristic based on polynomial optimization and convex relaxations",
    "is proposed for computing small volume polytopic outer approximations of a compact semialgebraic set .",
    "more recent works , like for instance @xcite , employ sets defined by semialgebraic conditions .",
    "the closest approach to the one proposed in our paper can be found in @xcite , in which the authors use polynomial sum - of - squares ( sos ) programming to address the problem of fitting given data with a convex polynomial , seen as a natural extension of quadratic polynomials and ellipsoids .",
    "convexity of the polynomial is ensured by enforcing that its hessian is matrix sos , and volume minimization is indirectly enforced by increasing the curvature of the polynomial . in @xcite",
    "the authors propose moment - based relaxations for the separation and covering problems with semialgebraic sets , thereby also extending the classical ellipsoidal sets used in data fitting problems .",
    "recently , the authors of @xcite have proposed an approach based on randomization , which constructs convex approximations of generic nonconvex sets which are _ neither inner nor outer _ , but they enjoy some specific probabilistic properties . in this context , an approximation is considered to be reliable if it contains `` most '' of the points in the given set with prescribed high probability .",
    "the key tool in this framework is the generation of random samples inside the given set , and the construction of a convex set containing these samples .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : prob_stat ] the notation used in this paper is introduced and the central problem addressed in this paper is defined . in order to be able to numerically solve the set approximation problem of interest , in section  [ sec : l1_form ] a related polynomial optimization problem is introduced and numerical methods for solving it are described in section  [ sec : sos ] . in section  [ sec : inner ] , we discuss how the results in this paper can be used to find inner approximations of semialgebraic sets . a first set of numerical examples is provided in section  [ sec : examples1 ] .",
    "using the central results on set approximation mentioned above , in section  [ sec : finite_samples ] we address the problem of reconstructing a set from a finite number of points in its interior . in section",
    "[ sec : sampling ] we provide algorithms for uniform sample generation in semialgebraic sets and in section  [ sec : conclusion ] some closing remarks are provided .",
    "before a description of the main problem addressed is provided , we introduce the basic notation that is used throughout the paper .",
    "the notation @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) means that the symmetric matrix @xmath17 is positive definite ( semidefinite ) , and given two matrices @xmath17 and @xmath18 we write @xmath19 whenever @xmath20 .",
    "given a set @xmath21 , its indicator function is defined as @xmath22 and its volume or , more precisely , the lebesgue measure of @xmath5 , is denoted by @xmath23 the set of all real coefficient polynomials of degree less than or equal to @xmath24 is denoted by @xmath25 . the monomial basis for this set is represented by the ( column ) vector @xmath26 , so that any @xmath27 can be expressed in the following form @xmath28 where @xmath6 is a real ( column ) vector to denote both the polynomial and the vector of its coefficients whenever no ambiguity is possible .",
    "] and @xmath29 is a symmetric matrix of appropriate size , often referred to as gram matrix .",
    "also , we denote by @xmath30 the set of polynomials @xmath31 that can be represented as sums of squares of other polynomials , i.e. @xmath32 finally , given a polynomial @xmath33 , define its @xmath7 norm over a compact set @xmath34 , denoted by @xmath35 or just @xmath7 when the set  @xmath34 used is clear from the context , as @xmath36      with the notation defined above , we are now ready to define the central problem in this paper .",
    "we consider the basic semialgebraic set @xmath5 defined in ( [ k - set ] ) , which is assumed to be compact and with a non - empty interior .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , the set @xmath5 has typically a complex description in terms of its defining polynomials ( e.g. coming from physical measurements and/or estimations ) .",
    "for this reason , we aim at finding a `` simpler '' approximation of this set which has enough degrees of freedom to capture its characteristics .",
    "this approximation is the polynomial superlevel set ( pss ) @xmath37 defined in ( [ pss ] ) in terms of a real multivariate polynomial @xmath33 of given degree @xmath24 .",
    "this degree controls the complexity of the approximation . among the family of possible pss that can be constructed , we search for the one that provides the set @xmath37 of minimum volume while containing the set of interest @xmath38 , hence capturing most of its the geometric features . formally , we define the following optimization problem    [ prob1 ] given @xmath39 and a compact semialgebraic set @xmath5 , find a polynomial @xmath33 whose pss @xmath37 is of minimum volume and contains @xmath5",
    ". that is , solve the following optimization problem @xmath40    note that this problem can be viewed as the natural extension of the problem of computing the minimum volume ellipsoid containing @xmath5 .",
    "indeed , if @xmath5 is convex and the polynomial @xmath6 is quadratic ( @xmath41 ) , then the infimum of problem is attained , and the optimal set @xmath37 is given by the unique ( convex ) ellipsoid of minimum volume that contains @xmath5 , called lwner - john ellipsoid .",
    "in particular , if @xmath5 is the convex - hull of a finite set of points , this ellipsoid can be computed by convex optimization , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "we remark however that , for @xmath24 greater than @xmath42 , the optimization problem is nonlinear and semi - infinite , in the sense that the optimization is over the finite - dimensional vector space @xmath25 , but subject to an infinite number of constraints , necessary to cope with the set inclusion .",

    "finally , the inequality @xmath45 readily follows from the inclusion @xmath71 .",
    "@xmath72 .    before introducing the approach we propose for the solution of problem [ prob1 ] , in the next subjection we briefly recall some recent results which are closely related to the problem considered in this paper , for the special case of homogeneous polynomials .      in this section ,",
    "we summarize existing results for the case when the polynomial @xmath73 defined as @xmath74 is assumed to be a _ homogeneous _",
    "polynomial , or form , of even degree @xmath75 in @xmath76 variables .",

    "note also that boundedness of @xmath82 implies that @xmath78 is nonnegative ,",
    "since if there is a point @xmath83 such that @xmath84 , and hence @xmath85 , then by homogeneity of @xmath78 it follows that @xmath86 for all @xmath87 and hence @xmath88 for all @xmath87 which contradicts boundedness of @xmath89 .",

    "moreover , when @xmath78 is not homogeneous , we do not know under which conditions on @xmath78 the function @xmath93 is convex in @xmath78 .",
    "motivated by these considerations , in the remainder of this paper we propose a simpler approach to the solution problem ( [ opt ] ) , which is not restricted to forms , and which does not require the potentially intricate numerical computation of moments ( [ mom ] ) of exponentials of homogeneous polynomials .",
    "the introduction of this approach is motivated by its analogy with the well - known trace heuristic for ellipsoidal approximation , and it consists of approximating the volume by means of the @xmath7-norm of the polynomial @xmath6 .",
    "it is assumed that a `` simple set '' @xmath94 containing @xmath5 is known . by `` simple '' we mean that analytic expressions of the moments of the lebesgue measure on @xmath34 should be available , so that integration of polynomials can be carried out readily . in the following ,",
