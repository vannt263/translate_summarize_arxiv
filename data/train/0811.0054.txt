    "the imaging vector magnetograph ( ivm ) was built in the early 1990s at the mees solar observatory , university of hawaii , to measure vector magnetic fields on the sun .",
    "the ivm is a complicated instrument requiring care in both taking of the data and the subsequent calibration and analysis for the determination of accurate vector magnetic fields .",
    "characteristics of the instrument and the data calibration have been described in a series of published papers @xcite .",
    "the present paper is a continuation of this series in which we identify and discuss two important issues with the ivm data and analysis that were previously not acknowledged in the literature .",
    "the ivm is designed to combine the advantages of two distinct types of magnetograph , namely , the narrow - band filter polarimeters and the spectroscopic polarimeters .",
    "both types are based on the zeeman effect with the use of magnetic - sensitive spectral lines .",
    "they both are in use , for example , onboard the newly launched hinode spacecraft @xcite .",
    "narrow - band filter magnetographs employ birefringent filters for wavelength selection @xcite . by rotating the crystal elements inside the filter , a narrow band spectral image of a polarization state",
    "is formed at a magnetically sensitive spectral line position .",
    "the advantage of the filter devices is that high spatial and temporal resolution 2-dimensional polarization images can be formed at high signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "it takes only @xmath1410 minutes to complete a single vector magnetogram .",
    "the disadvantage is that the four stokes parameters are not determined simultaneously within this period , so that spurious polarization may be introduced due to changes on the sun and in the earth s atmosphere .",
    "neither is the entire spectral line observed , which limits the diagnostic methods used in the magnetic field inversion process .",
    "the magnetic field filling factors can not be estimated with a narrow - band filter magnetograph @xcite and magneto - optical effects may be underestimated in the measurements of transverse fields @xcite .",
    "spectro - polarimeters record the solar images using a narrow slit placed in front of a spectrograph .",
    "stokes parameters are measured as functions of wavelength across a spectral line sensitive to the zeeman effect .",
    "high spectral resolution can be achieved . to minimize the influence of time - dependent seeing and solar variations , one such spectro - polarimeter , the advanced stokes polarimeter ( asp ) , uses two ccd cameras to record orthogonal polarization states simultaneously @xcite .",
    "the entire stokes spectral profiles are taken into account for inferring the magnetic fields and the magneto - optical effect and magnetic filling factor can both be well estimated .",
    "a disadvantage is that this kind of instrument takes a longer time , perhaps @xmath1420 minutes to an hour , to obtain a single vector magnetogram at high signal - to - noise ratios @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the observing field of view is often smaller than those of narrow band polarimeters .",
    "the haleakala stokes polarimeter ( hsp ) also belongs to this category @xcite .",
    "the mees ivm measures the vector magnetic field in a slightly different way from the above instruments .",
    "a fabry - prot  interferometer is employed to scan the entire magnetically sensitive spectral line ( fei @xmath15 ) at each imaging pixel with a spectral resolution of 0.04   and a wavelength coverage of 1.2  . in principle , the ivm is in the spectro - polarimeter category but it has a wide field of view , @xmath16 .",
    "the design aims at tackling the atmospheric seeing variation , at the same time acquiring data at high temporal ( @xmath17 minute data cadence ) and spatial ( @xmath18 pixel size ) resolution .",
    "the polarization precision is aimed at 0.001 @xcite .    as pointed out by @xcite ,",
    "two basic steps are involved in the reduction of the ivm data .",
    "step 1 : deduce the stokes parameters @xmath19 from the raw ivm data .",
    "the stokes @xmath20 represents the total intensity of the beam ; the stokes @xmath21 represent states of linear polarization in which the electromagnetic waves are in planes separated by @xmath22 with planes are perpendicular to the direction of the beam ; the stokes @xmath0 represents the circular polarization state in which the electromagnetic waves rotate around and propagate along the direction of the beam .",
    "the ivm software package was written to deal with many issues in the data in this step @xcite .",
    "step 2 : infer the vector magnetic field from stokes parameters via the radiative transfer equations for polarized spectral light in the presence of magnetic fields .",
    "this step is dependent on stokes inversion methods .",
    "three methods are implemented in the ivm package : `` wavelet method '' , `` derivative method '' and the `` triplet '' method .",
    "a number of investigations based on ivm data used the first two methods [ e.g. ] .",
    "the current work will use the `` triplet '' method which will also be described in detail in the appendix a. the `` triplet '' method was also used in the studies based on ivm data by a few [ e.g. ] .",
    "recently , two problems in the ivm data caught our attention .",
    "neither of them has been discussed in the literature , nor have they been taken into account in the standard ivm package .",
    "the effects of these two problems are examined in this paper .",
    "the first problem is that the spectral line center produced by the fabry - prot  shifts with time in the raw data .",
    "the cause of this problem is unknown , but is presumably related to a mechanical / thermal shift in the fabry - prot  causing the spectral line to drift throughout the day .",
    "if uncorrected , the wavelength shift in 1 hr reaches about 0.2  , equivalent to the ( very significant ) doppler shift of @xmath23 km s@xmath24 .",
    "we will discuss a procedure for minimizing the error caused by the shift in the stokes data without jeopardizing the solar velocity measurements .",
    "we do not know for how long the spectral line drift has been a problem with ivm : conceivably it affects all data taken with this instrument .",
    "the second problem is that the sign convention built into the ivm determination of stokes @xmath0 is unfortunately opposite to the conventional definition employed in the analysis of the radiative transfer of polarized radiation .",
    "a brief check shows that the problem was not present in the data taken on 19 june 1998 , but was present in data taken on 15 july 2002 , and on 6 august 2003 ( see figure 5 of @xcite ) .",
    "according to the ( anonymous ) referee of this paper , the problem has been unofficially discussed among ivm users , notably the late tom metcalf , who mentioned the stokes @xmath0-sign problem . by all the evidence",
    ", we suggest that the stokes-@xmath0 signs were correct before january 1999 with image size @xmath25 .",
    "the signs are wrong for the data taken after january 1999 when the ivm underwent a major upgrade , and acquired a larger ccd camera allowing image size @xmath26 .",
    "the stokes @xmath0-sign problem results in over - correction of the magneto - optical effect in the stokes polarization measurements and must be removed if accurate inversions are to be obtained .",
    "an important application of vector magnetograph is to determine the vertical component of the electric current density in the photosphere , which is an important measure of the non - potentiality of the active regions , the helicity content .",
    "it has the potential to illuminate the active region eruption process .",
    "electric current densities have been repeatedly obtained since the photospheric vector magnetic fields became available in 1980s [ e.g.]@xcite .",
    "all these calculations involve the resolution of the 180@xmath10  ambiguity in the transverse field directions @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will calculate the absolute vertical electric current density , @xmath27 , with the equation derived by which does not require the 180@xmath10  disambiguation of the transverse field directions .",
    "therefore , this removes one uncertainty in the current calculation .",
    "the @xmath27 is particularly useful for studying the mechanical forces due to currents induced in moving material @xcite .    in section 2",
    ", we give a brief description of the ivm instrument and the data reduction principles .",
    "sections 3 and 4 correspond to the steps 1 and in the ivm data reduction .",
    "we describe the procedure used to generate high - quality stokes images from ivm raw data with reference to the active region noaa 10001 on 20 june 2002 in section 3 , and describe the procedure to generate the vector magnetic fields from stokes images in section 4 .",
    "the absolute vertical current densities , @xmath9 , are presented in section 5 for two very different active regions , noaa 10001 of 20 june 2002 , and 10030 of 15 july 2002 .",
    "section 6 gives a summary of the results .",
    "a detailed description of the magnetic field inversion code , `` triplet fitter '' , is given in the appendix .",
    "the ivm has a square field - of - view 4.7 arcmin on a side .",
    "the basic components of the instrument include a polarization modulator , a tunable fabry - prot  filter , a beamsplitter , pre - filters , and charged - couple device ( ccd ) cameras @xcite . among the system components , the fabry - prot   is the fastest at scanning the spectral profiles .",
    "the time resolution of the system is limited by the ccd camera readout . for the photospheric magnetic field observations ,",
    "the fabry - prot  filter is centered at fei @xmath15 , with a wavelength coverage of 1.2   and a spectral resolution of 0.04  . currently , the ivm detector is a @xmath26 pixel ccd array .",
    "each pixel corresponds to @xmath28 spatial size and the readout rate per pixel is 320 khz .",
    "it takes 0.8 second to read out the whole array , in which time interval is made to a change among the four polarization states , and a scan of a new wavelength position .",
    "therefore , an ivm data set including 30 wavelength positions in four polarization states can be completed in @xmath29 minutes .",
    "a special feature of the ivm is that two practically identical cameras record the image simultaneously : the so - called `` data '' and `` geometry '' cameras . their purpose is to minimize the `` seeing '' effect on the polarization signals obtained in the 4 polarization states at different times .",
    "the only significant difference between the two cameras is the filters in front of them : a narrow band 3   filter for the `` data '' camera to select a single order from the fabry - prot  centered at the fei @xmath15 , and a broad band 100   filter for the `` geometry '' camera to select roughly 30 orders from the fabry - prot .",
    "the idea is that the `` data '' camera records the polarization images , and the `` geometry '' camera records the ( nearly ) continuum images .",
    "any brightness fluctuations in the `` geometry '' camera must be due to `` seeing '' variations , while changes recorded by the `` data '' camera are due to polarization signals from the sun .",
    "a standard ivm calibration package has been implemented in idl procedures based on the ivm observational model described by @xcite . in the package ,",
    "the correction of the dark current , flat field , scattered light and polarization cross - talk are first executed .",
    "the effects of the `` seeing '' on the images include blurring , displacing and distorting the fine solar structures .",
    "the best `` geometry '' image is chosen within a single data set as a reference image .",
    "shifting , de - blurring and de - stretching functions are then applied to the whole set of `` geometry '' images .",
    "these very same corrections are then applied to the set of `` data '' images @xcite .",
    "the final output consists of the calibrated stokes images , @xmath19 .",
    "in this and section 4 , we describe the reduction procedures with reference to the active region noaa 10001 . in this section",
    ", we describe the stokes parameters reduction corresponding to the ivm data reduction step 1 . on 20 june 2002 this ar consisted of a single spot of area 200 [ @xmath30 of solar hemisphere ] surrounded by a plage region and projected near the disk center n20w07 .",
    "it was observed continually from 17:00 to 22:20 ut by the ivm , giving a total of 149 vector magnetograms .",

    "@xcite commented `` when this seeing measure decreases towards 0.005 , granulation is no longer visible and the seeing is estimated 2 arc sec . ''",
    "ideally , @xmath41 should be invariant with the polarization state .",
    "in reality , the `` geometry '' camera receives the same beam as the `` data '' camera which is modulated by the polarization modulator . as a result ,",
    "the geometry images include the polarization characteristics of the spectral line but diluted by a factor of @xmath44 because one of 30 fabry - prot  orders falls in the line fei 6302.5  .",

    "about 20% of the data satisfy @xmath45 .",
    "since we are mostly interested in the sunspot and its penumbra , we relax the seeing threshold to @xmath32 ( see the middle column images in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) which allows 53% of the total 149 data sets to be selected for further processing .",

    "the seeing is @xmath46 , which will be the minimum pixel sample size in the following data analysis .",
    "one of the system imperfections is that the central wavelength varies with spatial position on the detector .",
    "the central wavelength varies quadratically with position in the field because the fabry - prot  is used in the collimated beam .",
    "this was discussed by @xcite and is implemented in the calibration of the flat field in the ivm software package .",

    "we determine the spectral line centers with the minimum stokes @xmath20 intensity over the `` quiet sun '' . sometimes , the central positions are one pixel apart in consecutive ivm data sets due to the line center fluctuation .",
    "this occurred more frequently when the telluric line was strong in the morning such as before 18 ut in the current data ( see fig .",
    "[ spectrallines ] ) .",
    "the complication caused by the spectral line shift is that it is a mixture of real solar vertical motions due to the doppler effect and the instrumental ivm spectral shifts .",

    "several methods have been developed to infer the vector magnetic field on the sun from polarization measurements of zeeman - split spectral lines ( see section 1 ) .",
    "the `` triplet '' method is based on a simple model for the transfer of polarized light in the solar atmosphere @xcite .",
    "the model parameters ( e.g. , magnetic field strength and direction ) are varied until the best fit to the observed stokes profiles is obtained @xcite . here",
    ", we use the formulation of the method given by @xcite ( hereafter ll82 ) .",
    "we describe the implementation of the method for ivm , which produces images in four stokes parameters ( @xmath19 ) and 30 wavelengths in fe  i 6302.5  .",
    "the implementation takes advantage of the fact that the thermodynamic parameters of the model can be estimated directly from the observed continuum intensity .",
    "the `` triplet '' code was originally developed by the late barry j. labonte .",
    "when a magnetic field is present , the atomic energy levels with angular momentum quantum numbers @xmath191 are split into multiple components with magnetic quantum numbers @xmath192 .",
    "ll82 described the formation of a `` normal '' zeeman triplet in which @xmath193 for the lower level ( no zeeman splitting ) and @xmath194 for the upper level . in the case of fe  i 6302.5  , the upper level has @xmath193 and the lower level has @xmath194 , but this reversal of the split and unsplit levels compared to a normal triplet does not affect the emergent stokes profiles .",
    "therefore , the formulae presented by ll82 can also be used for the 6302.5  line .",
    "the line formation model used by ll82 makes several assumptions .",
    "first , the emitting atoms are assumed to be in local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) , i.e. , the populations of the atomic levels are in agreement with the boltzmann equation and the source function of the emitted radiation is given by the planck function , @xmath195 , where @xmath196 is the local temperature .",
    "also , the solar atmosphere is assumed to have plane - parallel stratification in the region of emission , and the temperature @xmath197 is assumed to decrease with height @xmath198 such that the planck function @xmath199 at @xmath200  is a _ linear _ function of continuum optical depth , @xmath201 ( milne - eddington approximation ) . here @xmath202 is the value of the planck function at the top of the photosphere ( temperature minimum region ) , and @xmath203 is the gradient of the planck function .",
    "other parameters of the model are the magnetic field vector @xmath204 , doppler shift @xmath205 ( due to mass flows on the sun ) , doppler width @xmath206 , line broadening parameter @xmath207 , and certain ratios of line- and continuum opacity ( see below ) .",
    "these quantities are assumed to be independent of continuum optical depth @xmath208 .",
    "the assumption of lte is reasonable in the photosphere where collisional excitation of the atoms dominates over radiative processes .",
    "the other assumptions are questionable because observations show that the solar photosphere is inhomogeneous and dynamic .    with the above approximations ,",
    "the equations of radiative transfer of polarized light in a zeeman - split spectral line can be solved analytically ( ll82 ) .",

    "the observed stokes profiles generally include a contribution from instrumental stray light .",
    "also , the magnetic field outside sunspots is structured on subarcsecond scales that are not resolved by the ivm instrument .",
    "therefore , the observed profiles contain both polarized and unpolarized components : @xmath237 where subscript `` s '' refers to the unpolarized component of the emission ( straylight and/or non - magnetic contribution ) ; @xmath238 is the filling factor , i.e. , the fraction of radiation due to the polarized component ; and @xmath239 is the intensity profile of the unpolarized component @xcite .",
    "the latter is assumed to be given by equation ( [ eq : im ] ) without a magnetic field : @xmath240 , \\label{eq : is}\\ ] ] where @xmath241 , @xmath242 and @xmath243 are the source function , line - to - continuum opacity ratio , and doppler shift characterizing the unpolarization component , and @xmath244 .",

    "the profile @xmath247 is mostly determined by the fabry - perot filter .",

    "to determine these parameters , the `` triplet '' code uses two different methods , one for plage regions",
    "where the magnetic field strength @xmath233 and filling factor @xmath238 can not be independently determined ( method i ) , and another for sunspots where a non - linear least - square fitting procedure can be used ( method ii ) .",
    "method i is also used to obtain initial values of the model parameters inside sunspots , as a starting point for non - linear least - square fitting .",
    "therefore , we describe this method first .",
    "_ method i _ : first , certain estimates of the thermodynamic parameters are obtained for all pixels in the ivm image . specifically , the doppler width is approximated by @xmath252 , where @xmath196 is the brightness temperature associated with the observed continuum intensity ; @xmath253 is the atomic mass of iron ; and @xmath254 is a micro - turbulent velocity .",
    "the latter is approximated by @xmath255 $ ] km / s .",
    "the line broadening is assumed to be dominated by van der waals broadening , @xmath256 , where @xmath257 is the most probable speed of the hydrogen atoms , @xmath258 @xmath259 is the total hydrogen density at the height where the continuum is formed , and @xmath260 @xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath202 and @xmath231 are estimated as @xmath261 where @xmath262 is the observed continuum intensity , @xmath263 is the observed line center intensity , and @xmath264 .",
    "next , to obtain more accurate values of the thermodynamic parameters , a quiet area in the ivm field of view is selected , and an expression similar to equation ( [ eq : is ] ) is fit to the observed intensity @xmath265 from the quiet region . this yields fitted values of the parameters @xmath202 , @xmath246 , @xmath231 and @xmath206 for each `` quiet '' pixel .",
    "then the mean of the estimated values of @xmath202 for the `` quiet '' pixels is divided by the mean of the fitted values to obtain a correction factor @xmath266 , and similar for the parameters @xmath246 , @xmath231 and @xmath206 .",
    "finally , the correction factors are applied to the estimated values of @xmath202 , @xmath246 , @xmath231 and @xmath206 for all pixels , including plage and sunspot regions ( @xmath207 is unchanged from its estimated value ) .",
    "this yields the final values of the thermodynamic parameters for method i.    we now describe how the magnetic parameters are determined in method i. in facular areas outside sunspots , the zeeman splitting is less than the doppler width and the stokes profiles do not contain sufficient information to independently determine both the magnetic field strength ( @xmath233 ) and the filling factor ( @xmath238 ) ; only their product @xmath267 is well - constrained by the observations .",
    "therefore , we assume a fixed field strength of the magnetic elements , @xmath268 g. furthermore , we assume that the stokes profile can be approximated as follows : @xmath269 where @xmath270 and @xmath271 are reference profiles computed with equations ( [ eq : qm ] ) and ( [ eq : vm ] ) for some nonzero inclination angle @xmath272 and azimuth angle @xmath273 .",

    "equations ( [ eq : quvm1 ] ) are fitted to the observed stokes profiles using linear least - square fitting , which determines the parameters @xmath274 , @xmath275 and @xmath276",
    ". then equations ( [ eq : quv ] ) are inverted as follows : @xmath278    _ method ii _ : this inversion method is used in sunspots .",
    "the spot areas are identified by the differences of the continuum brightness relative to the quiet sun . for each pixel inside a sunspot , the thermodynamic and magnetic parameters",
    "are determined by non - linear least - square fitting of equation ( [ eq : sn ] ) to the observed normalized stokes parameters , @xmath279_n$ ] with @xmath280 .",
    "the fitting uses the levenberg - marquart algorithm @xcite .",
    "the observed intensities @xmath281 are not used in the fit .",
    "only certain parameters are allowed to vary in this fitting process ( @xmath202 , @xmath231 , @xmath205 , @xmath233 , @xmath236 , @xmath8 and @xmath238 ) , while others are fixed to the values determined with method i ( @xmath246 , @xmath206 and @xmath207 ) .",
    "the reason is that the observed stokes profiles do not provide strong constraints on the latter set of model parameters .",
    "the initial values of the variable parameters are those obtained from method i. however , to ensure fitting convergence the initial filling factors and field strengths are adjusted such that @xmath282 .",
    "certain checks are carried out to make sure that the magnetic field strength @xmath283 , the inclination angle @xmath236 is in the range @xmath284 $ ] , and the filling factor is in the range @xmath285 . for pixels with parameter values outside",
    "these ranges the non - linear fitting process may have failed to converge .",
    "the parameters at these `` bad pixels '' are assigned median values from surrounding pixels , and the fitting is run again to obtain improved values .",
    "the azimuth angle is adjusted such that @xmath286 i.e. , no ambiguity solution is performed .    the final output from the `` triplet '' code ( for both methods i and ii ) gives the longitudinal and transverse fields , which are defined by @xmath287 near solar disk center , @xmath5 is essentially the magnetic flux density in an ivm pixel .",
    "however , @xmath128 does not have a clear physical interpretation . to obtain the transverse magnetic field @xmath288 in the unresolved magnetic elements , one should divide @xmath128 by the filling factor .",

    "<S> first , we describe a general procedure to produce high quality vector magnetograms using the imaging vector magnetograph ( ivm ) at mees solar observatory . </S>",
    "<S> two ivm effects are newly discussed and taken into account : ( 1 ) the central wavelength of the fabry - prot  is found to drift with time as a result of undiagnosed thermal or mechanical instabilities in the instrument ; ( 2 ) the stokes @xmath0-sign convention built into the ivm is found to be opposite to the conventional definition used in the study of radiative transfer of polarized radiation . at the spatial resolution @xmath1 , the stokes @xmath2 uncertainty reaches @xmath3 - @xmath4 in time - averaged data over 1-hour in the quiet sun . when vector magnetic fields are inferred from the time - averaged stokes spectral images of fei 6302.5  , the resulting uncertainties are on the order of 10 g for the longitudinal fields ( @xmath5 ) , 40 g for the transverse field strength ( @xmath6 ) and @xmath7 for the magnetic azimuth ( @xmath8 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field inversion used in this work is the `` triplet '' code , which was developed and implemented in the ivm software package by the late barry j. labonte . </S>",
    "<S> the inversion code is described in detail in the appendix .    </S>",
    "<S> second , we solve for the absolute value of the vertical electric current density , @xmath9 , accounting for the above ivm problems , for two different active regions . </S>",
    "<S> one is a single sunspot region ( noaa 10001 observed on 20 june 2002 ) while the other is a more complex , quadrupolar region ( noaa10030 observed on 15 july 2002 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we use a calculation that does not require disambiguation of 180@xmath10 in the transverse field directions . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath9 uncertainty is on the order of @xmath11 ma m@xmath12 . the vertical current density increases with increasing vertical magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the rate of increase is about @xmath13 times as large in the quadrupolar noaa 10030 region as in the simple noaa 10001 , and it is more spatially variable over noaa 10030 than over noaa 10001 . </S>"
