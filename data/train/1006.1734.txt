    "optical dipole forces acting on molecules in nonresonant laser fields is a hot subject of many recent experimental studies @xcite . by controlling molecular translational degrees of freedom with laser fields @xcite ,",
    "novel elements of molecular optics can be realized , including molecular lens @xcite and molecular prism @xcite .",
    "the mechanism of molecular interaction with a nonuniform laser field is rather clear : the field induces molecular polarization , interacts with it , and deflects the molecules along the intensity gradient .",
    "as most molecules have anisotropic polarizability , the deflecting force depends on the molecular orientation with respect to the deflecting field .",
    "previous studies on optical molecular deflection have mostly considered randomly oriented molecules , for which the deflection angle is somehow dispersed around the mean value determined by the orientation - averaged polarizability .",
    "the latter becomes intensity - dependent for strong enough fields due to the field - induced modification of the molecular angular motion @xcite .",
    "this adds a new ingredient for controlling molecular trajectories @xcite , which is important , but somehow limited because of using the same fields for the deflection process and orientation control .    in this work , we show that the deflection process can be significantly affected and controlled by _ preshaping _ molecular angular distribution _ before _ the molecules enter the interaction zone .",
    "this can be done with the help of numerous recent techniques for laser molecular alignment , which use single or multiple short laser pulses ( transform - limited , or shaped ) to align molecular axes along certain directions .",
    "short laser pulses excite rotational wavepackets , which results in a considerable transient molecular alignment after the laser pulse is over , i.e. at field - free conditions ( for reviews on field - free alignment , see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "field - free alignment was observed both for small diatomic molecules as well as for more complex molecules , for which full three - dimensional control was realized @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate that the average scattering angle of the deflected molecules and its distribution may be dramatically modified by a proper field - free prealignment . by separating the processes of the angular shaping and the actual deflection ,",
    "one gets a flexible tool for tailoring molecular motion in inhomogeneous optical and static fields .",
    "the main principles of this new approach were briefly introduced in our recent letter @xcite .",
    "here we present a much more elaborated analysis of the control mechanisms , including also a detailed comparison between the quantum and classical aspects of the problem , and discussion of the strong field effects in molecular scattering .    in sec .",

    "+ assume now that the molecules are prealigned before entering the deflection zone by a strong and short laser pulse that is polarized _ perpendicular _ to the polarization direction of the deflecting field ( e.g. , in @xmath4-direction ) .",

    "these assumptions are valid even for strong deflecting fields ( that align the molecules ) since the deflection angle is still small .",
    "we consider both weak and strong deflecting fields , as in fig .",
    "[ strong_distribution_alignment ] , and use the values of @xmath204 and @xmath205 ( eq . [ e_deflect_field ] ) in the calculation of the trajectories .    the distribution of deflected velocities for a thermal molecular ensemble ( without prealignment ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ strong_distribution_v_z ] .        in fig .",
    "[ strong_distribution_v_z]a ( weak field ) we essentially verify our assumption from the previous sections , that the deflection in weak fields is linear with @xmath33 ( eq . [ deflection angle ] ) .",
    "this is seen by observing that fig .",
    "[ strong_distribution_v_z]a may be indeed obtained by a linear transformation of the distribution @xmath43 from fig .",
    "[ strong_distribution_alignment]a . in fig .",
    "[ strong_distribution_v_z]b ( strong field ) the distribution of deflection angles ( or of deflection velocities ) is still quite broad . to our opinion , this results from two different regimes of scattering that the molecules experience while traversing the deflecting beam : weak deflection at the periphery of the beam , and deflection under partial alignment of the molecular ensemble in the center of the beam .    ) .",
    "case ( a ) is for weak deflecting field , and case ( b ) is for strong deflecting field . in both cases",
    "the molecules were prealigned parallel to the deflecting field , and this prealignment was strong enough to ignore any aligning effect of the deflecting field ( thus reducing the broadening of the deflection , as was explained in the previous sections).,width=302 ]    finally we consider scattering of molecules prealigned in the @xmath3 direction with the pulses having kick strength of @xmath104 .",
    "the results are given in figs .",
    "[ strong_distribution_v_z_alignment]a and b for weak and strong deflecting fields , respectively .    in the case of weak deflection ( fig .",
    "[ strong_distribution_v_z_alignment]a ) , the narrow peak is observed whose nature was already explained above .",
    "more interestingly , the distribution of the deflection angles regained the narrow shape even in the case of strong deflection field ( fig .",
    "[ strong_distribution_v_z_alignment]b ) as a result of prealignment ! in our example , the prealignment pulse was strong enough to overcome the rotational trapping by the deflecting field .",
    "as a result , all the molecules performed full rotations ( but not a pendular motion ) despite the presence of the strong deflecting field , and we obtain a narrow distribution as well .",
    "our results indicate that prealignment provides an effective tool for controlling the deflection of rotating molecules , and it may be used for increasing the brightness of the scattered molecular beam . this increase was shown both for weak and strong deflecting fields",
    ". this might be important for nano - fabrication schemes based on the molecular optics approach @xcite .",
    "moreover , molecular deflection by non - resonant optical dipole force is considered as a promising route to separation of molecular mixtures ( for a recent review , see @xcite ) .",
    "narrowing the distribution of the scattering angles may substantially increase the efficiency of separation of multi - component beams , especially when the prealignment is applied selectively to certain molecular species , such as isotopes @xcite , or nuclear spin isomers @xcite .",
    "more complicated techniques for pre - shaping the molecular angular distribution may be considered , such as confining molecular rotation to a certain plane by using the `` optical molecular centrifuge '' approach @xcite , double - pulse ignited `` molecular propeller '' @xcite , or planar alignment by perpendicularly polarized laser pulses @xcite . in this case , a narrow angular peak is expected in molecular scattering , whose position is controllable by inclination of the plane of rotation with respect to the deflecting field @xcite .",
    "laser prealignment may be used to manipulate molecular deflection by inhomogeneous _",
    "static _ fields as well @xcite ( for recent exciting experiments on _ post - alignment _ of molecules scattered by static electric fields see @xcite )",
    ". in particular , one may affect molecular motion in relatively weak fields that are insufficient to modify rotational states by themselves .",
    "moreover , the same mechanisms may prove efficient for controlling inelastic molecular scattering off metalic / dielectric surfaces .",
    "these and other aspects of the present problem are subjects of an ongoing investigation .",
    "this research is made possible in part by the historic generosity of the harold perlman family .",
