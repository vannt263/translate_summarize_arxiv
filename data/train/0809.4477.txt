    "the key observation underlying the philosophy of our proof is contained in lemma [ lemma : stabilitytrick ] below , which says that to prove theorem [ theorem : mainh2closed ] , it is enough to prove a similar stability result for @xmath61 .",

    "it is perhaps amusing to observe that our proof is essentially the inductive step for such an induction , but with no need for a base case !",

    "we attempt to imitate this",
    ".    alas , it does not quite work .",
    "the problem is that for @xmath74 , the output of the homological stability machinery is that the natural map @xmath75 is surjective for @xmath4 .",

    "two different lifts give conjugate stabilizer subgroups and hence the same homology groups .",
    "this is not enough because unlike @xmath7 , the group @xmath64 does not act transitively on the set of nonseparating simple closed curves . to solve this problem , we must perform a group cohomological computation to show that the stabilizers of any two simple closed nonseparating curves give the same `` chunk '' of homology , and thus that the map @xmath62 is surjective .",
    "the key to this computation is a certain vanishing result of the author ( @xcite ; see lemma [ lemma : vanishing ] below ) for the twisted first homology groups of @xmath64 with coefficients in the homology groups of abelian covers of the surface .    one reason why the standard homological stability machinery must break when applied to @xmath19",
