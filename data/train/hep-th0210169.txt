    "we will construct spectral density related to matrices @xmath11 .    the spectral measure for spectral parameter @xmath22",
    "was first considered in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that if one truncates the matrix @xmath23 to a finite @xmath24 matrix by restricting @xmath25 the eigenvalues have a uniform distribution with density @xmath26 in the limit @xmath27 .",
    "there are however corrections to the density at finite @xmath0 and as it was already noted in @xcite these corrections become large for large @xmath28 ( and fixed @xmath0 ) .",

    "more precisely using the orthogonality and completeness relations ( [ o_c ] ) one can write the following expression for the level truncated distribution function @xmath30 this expression stems from the fact that for a given symmetric matrix @xmath31 with spectral representation @xmath32 the following identity is true @xmath33 one can then numerically study the difference @xmath34 .",

    "in fact it is technically more advantageous , but leads to the same result , if we consider the limit @xmath44 of the quantity @xmath45 the computation of this quantity is done in the next section by performing a certain contour integration . taking the limit @xmath44 one obtains @xmath46\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the euler constant and @xmath48 is the logarithmic derivative of the @xmath49-function .",

    "a particular sft computation involving @xmath29 is a computation of an overlap of two surface states discussed in @xcite .",
    "even with the use of the exact analytic expression ( [ main1 ] ) this computation still seems to be at odds with cft results @xcite .",
    "we hope to return to this issue in the nearest future .",
    "we need to find an analytic expression for the regulated spectral density @xmath51 defined in ( [ rho_q ] ) .",
    "let us start by computing a more general expression @xmath52 it can be expressed via a contour integral ( see figure  [ fig:1]a ) @xmath53        here @xmath54 is an analytic function defined on a complex plane with cuts going along the imaginary axis from @xmath55 to @xmath56 and from @xmath57 to @xmath58 and the branch of @xmath59 is chosen by the standard series expansion within the circle @xmath60 , i.e. one takes main branches for both logarithms . the function @xmath61 is defined on a complex plane with a cut going along the imaginary axis from @xmath62 to @xmath63 and the branch is fixed by the standard series expansion outside of the circle @xmath64 .",

    "if we consider an integral @xmath83 where @xmath84 is a schwartz class test function , then the fourier transform @xmath85 of the function @xmath86 provides a damping factor at @xmath87 that allows one to drop out the function @xmath81 in the limit @xmath44 .",
    "this provides an alternative ( and in our opinion a cleaner ) derivation of the orthogonality property ( [ o_c ] ) .",
