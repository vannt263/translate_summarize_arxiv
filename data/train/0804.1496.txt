    "the aim of this paper is to derive the continuum expression of the elastic energy and interfacial energy of a one - dimensional elastic crystal from an atomistic model .",
    "the motivation of that analysis came from our desire to justify the continuum model proposed in ball & mora - corral @xcite , according to which the same material can exhibit smooth and sharp interfaces . in the one - dimensional case ,",
    "that model is briefly described as follows .",
    "the elastic solid is represented by the interval @xmath0 , for some @xmath1 .",
    "an elastic deformation of the body @xmath0 is represented by an increasing , absolutely continuous map @xmath2 such that the function @xmath3 restricted to @xmath4 is in the sobolev space @xmath5 , for some finite set @xmath6 depending on @xmath3 .",
    "then , in @xcite we postulated that equilibrium configurations are minimisers of the energy @xmath7 defined by @xmath8 { \\ , \\mathrm{d}}x + { \\kappa}\\operatorname{card}(s_{u ' } ) , \\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the set of discontinuity points of @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are two small parameters .",
    "in @xcite we saw that , when @xmath12 is assumed to have two wells , if @xmath13 then the global minimisers @xmath3 of @xmath7 ( subject to appropriate dirichlet boundary conditions ) satisfy @xmath14 , and , in particular , they present sharp interfaces , whereas if @xmath15 , then the global minimisers satisfy @xmath16 and present smooth interfaces .",
    "this suggests that in the expression , one should replace @xmath17 with a multiple of @xmath18 , since only when @xmath17 is comparable to @xmath18 can both smooth and sharp interfaces appear simultaneously .    in this paper",
    ", we try to derive the energy ( once @xmath17 has been substituted by a multiple of @xmath18 ) from an atomistic one .",
    "the main idea , which is based on the procedure of blanc , le bris & lions @xcite , is the following .",
    "we assume that there is a continuum deformation @xmath19 \\to { \\mathbb{r}}$ ] such that , for every small @xmath20 , the atomistic ( discrete ) deformation is the restriction of @xmath3 to @xmath21 \\cap { \\varepsilon}{\\mathbb{z}}$ ] , and the atomistic energy of that discrete deformation is given by @xmath22 \\cap { \\varepsilon}{\\mathbb{z } } } \\sum_{i \\neq j \\in { \\mathbb{z}}\\cap \\frac{1}{{\\varepsilon } } [ a , b ] } w \\left ( \\frac{u({\\varepsilon}j ) - u({\\varepsilon}i)}{{\\varepsilon } } \\right ) , \\ ] ] where @xmath23 is a two - body interaction potential with suitable decay at infinity ( for example , a lennard - jones potential ) .",
    "next , we do a taylor expansion of @xmath24 with respect to @xmath18 , with the hope of recovering the expression .",
    "to be precise , we compute the first terms of that expansion : @xmath25 and , in this way , we partially succeed in justifying the model , in the sense that @xmath26 accounts for the elastic energy , @xmath27 accounts for the sharp interface energy ( plus boundary terms ) , and @xmath28 accounts for the smooth interface energy ( plus boundary and jump terms ) .",
    "the essential difference with the paper of blanc , le bris & lions @xcite is the regularity assumption on @xmath3 . while in @xcite they assumed that @xmath3 was smooth enough so that all the taylor expansions made sense , here we assume that @xmath3 is continuous and piecewise smooth , so that @xmath10 can have jumps . in this way",
    ", we obtain , within @xmath27 , a term that accounts for the sharp interfaces . sections [ se : smooth][se : separated ] are devoted precisely to the computation of from .",
    "in sections [ se : repulsion ] and [ se : optimal ] we change slightly the above atomistic model in order to get , in the continuum limit , an additional term that accounts for the repulsion between sharp interfaces .",
    "the motivation of that analysis was led by our desire to obtain the expression of a repulsion term between interfaces from an atomistic energy . in the continuum context",
    ", it is not clear how to define an energy that represents a repulsion term between interfaces , let alone in our setting where we have two kind of interfaces : smooth and sharp . in general terms , that repulsion energy would be given by a non - local expression depending on the distance between interfaces , and be a decreasing function of that distance which tends to infinity when the distance tends to zero .",
    "it is not clear , however , how to express that in a formula , since a ` smooth interface region ' is only defined in vague terms as a region where the absolute value of the second derivative is very high . among the three possible kinds of interaction between two interfaces ( smooth - smooth , smooth - sharp and sharp - sharp )",
    ", only the sharp - sharp interface interaction energy is easy to model , namely , as a function depending on the distance between the two interfaces , as describe above .",
    "here we are using the fact that , in dimension @xmath29 , a sharp interface is represented by a single point ; in higher dimensions , in contrast , the sharp - sharp interface interaction energy is not so easy to define .    in section [ se : repulsion ]",
    "we try to derive this repulsion term between sharp interfaces , and , again , we succeed only partially .",
    "the derivation follows a similar procedure to the one described above , but with an important difference that we describe now .",
    "let @xmath20 be the interatomic distance .",
    "then we assume that the two sharp interfaces are located at @xmath30 and @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is a natural number .",
    "so we are assuming that the interfaces are at a distance which is a fixed multiple of the interatomic distance .",
    "this assumption was motivated by the experiments of baele , van tendeloo & amelinckx @xcite , who observed a quasiperiodic microtwinning in the alloy ni - mn resulting from a martensitic transformation , and whose images suggest that two consecutive sharp interfaces are separated by a distance which is @xmath33 or @xmath34 or @xmath35 times the interatomic distance .",
    "the procedure is as follows .",
    "as above , we assume that there is a continuous deformation @xmath36 \\to { \\mathbb{r}}$ ] which is smooth in @xmath37 $ ] and @xmath38 $ ] , for some @xmath30 , and such that the atomistic deformation @xmath39 follows @xmath3 in @xmath37 \\cup [ t_0 + { \\varepsilon}m , b]$ ] ( much like in the analysis of the section [ se : sharp ] ) , but follows a discrete deformation @xmath40 in @xmath41 .",
    "the discrete deformation @xmath42 will be given by an optimal profile problem . to be precise , we consider the energy of this @xmath39 and calculate its taylor expansion .",
    "we interpret the difference between this energy and the energy of the first model as a repulsion term between interfaces . naturally , the coefficients @xmath43 will depend not only on @xmath3 but also on @xmath42 .",
    "we will see that the coefficient @xmath26 does not depend on @xmath42 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath27 does depend on @xmath42 , and we choose @xmath42 to minimise @xmath27 .",
    "it turns out that , in many cases , the optimal @xmath42 is the straight line .",
    "this might explain why , in the region between two sharp interfaces , the atoms are aligned in a straight line .",
    "a further minimisation process shows that the optimal @xmath44 is @xmath33 , which qualitatively coincides with the experiments of baele , van tendeloo & amelinckx @xcite explained above .    in this paragraph",
    "we compare our approaches to similar ones found in the literature .",
    "as mentioned above , the analysis of section [ se : sharp ] follows closely that of blanc , le bris & lions @xcite , with the important difference that our continuum deformation @xmath3 is continuous and piecewise smooth ( instead of being smooth ) . the closest to the analysis of section [ se : repulsion ] that we have found in the literature is the paper of blanc & le bris @xcite .",
    "they assume that the sharp interfaces are at a distance @xmath45 which is larger than the atomistic scale but smaller than macroscopic , so @xmath46 ; this is different from our approach , as our @xmath45 would be @xmath47 .",
    "their atomistic energy equals the analogue of plus a term accounting for the energy between the two sharp interfaces . that energy is given again by an optimal profile problem , but , in their case , the deformation between two sharp interfaces is a continuum one .",
    "although they approach is very natural , it does not predict a repulsion term between interfaces ; quite the opposite : the energy associated with two consecutive sharp interfaces is an increasing function of the distance between them .",
    "we believe that that conclusion is wrong , and this was one of our motivations to present our model of section [ se : repulsion ] .",
    "of course , there is a great number of atomic - to - continuum derivations for elastic and surface energy .",
    "we have pointed out those whose approach is similar to that adopted here . for radically different approaches , see , for example , arndt & griebel @xcite ( who use an upscaling method ) and braides & cicalese @xcite ( who use @xmath48-convergence ) , as well as the references therein .",
    "there are several disadvantages to be found in the atomic - to - continuum method used in this paper .",
    "some of them are already present in blanc , le bris & lions @xcite : the macroscopic displacement is assumed to be equal to the microscopic one , the atomic deformation is assumed to follow a given smooth ( or piecewise smooth , in our case ) deformation , the lattice is assumed to be periodic even near the boundary of the body , the taylor expansion is not uniform in @xmath3 , there is no guarantee that minimisers of the atomistic energy converge to minimisers of the continuum energy , and , finally , the limit continuum problem is not well - posed ( because it is not coercive ) .",
    "in addition , in our approach we also have the disadvantage that , although we allow for more general deformations ( piecewise smooth as opposed to smooth ) , the discontinuity set of the deformation gradient is prescribed .",
    "there are , nevertheless , some advantages to be found in our approach .",
    "first , it detects the right scaling between smooth and sharp interfaces : the term accounting for sharp interfaces appears in the coefficient @xmath18 of the taylor expansion , while the term accounting for smooth interfaces appears in the coefficient @xmath49 ; this corroborates the scaling deduced in ball & mora - corral @xcite by @xmath48-convergence methods .",
    "second , it detects ( or suggests ) the ` general form ' of a continuum energy functional accounting for elastic energy , sharp - interface energy and smooth - interface energy , thus partially justifying the model of @xcite .",
    "third , it is able to predict a repulsion term between sharp intrefaces and to describe roughly the atomistic configuration between two consecutive sharp interfaces , in qualitative agreement with the experiments of baele , van tendeloo & amelinckx @xcite .",
    "we do not consider the restriction to the one - dimensional setting to be a disadvantage , because we believe that many of the calculations in this paper can be carried out to the higher - dimensional case , as done in blanc , le bris & lions @xcite .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section [",
    "se : smooth ] we introduce the general notation of the paper , and state one of the main results of blanc , le bris & lions @xcite , which is the taylor expansion for smooth deformations , and constitutes the starting point of this paper . in section [",
    "se : map ] we study the map that transforms the atomistic potential into the elastic one . to be precise",
    ", a consequence of @xcite ( which we recall in section [ se : smooth ] ) is that the term @xmath26 of has the form @xmath50 , for a function @xmath51 depending on @xmath12 .",
    "we show that blow - up rates at @xmath52 and decay rates at @xmath53 of @xmath12 imply the corresponding properties on @xmath51 , and we give sufficient conditions for the map @xmath54 to be an isomorphism .",
    "section [ se : sharp ] is the core of the paper and contains the calculation of the taylor expansion for a continuous and piecewise smooth deformation @xmath3 having exactly one sharp interface . in section [",
    "se : sign ] we compare the conclusion of the result of @xcite recalled in section [ se : smooth ] with our result of section [ se : sharp ] . in our analysis , there is a new term accounting for the sharp interfaces ; we study the sign of that term and give sufficient conditions for it to be positive ; this positivity physically means that we need energy to create a sharp interface .",
    "section [ se : separated ] shows that if the deformation has several sharp interfaces that are separated at a macroscopic distance , then the analysis does not essentially differ from the case of one interface ( showed in section [ se : sharp ] ) , since the term accounting for the interaction between sharp interfaces is of order @xmath55 .",
    "section [ se : repulsion ] contains the other principal result of the paper : we present the model for a deformation with two sharp interfaces that are separated at a distance multiple of the atomic one , and calculate the corresponding taylor expansion .",
    "section [ se : optimal ] compares the conclusion of the results of sections [ se : sharp ] and [ se : repulsion ] .",
    "the new term that appears in section [ se : repulsion ] is a term that accounts for a repulsion force between the two sharp interfaces ; in some particular cases , we solve the optimal problem and , thus , describe the atomistic configuration between two consecutive sharp interfaces .",
    "in this section we introduce the general setting and notation of the paper , and state the result on the taylor expansion of the atomistic energy in the case of a smooth deformation .",
    "it is known that in the atomic - to - continuum analysis , the taylor expansion as @xmath18 goes to zero depends on the particular sequence of @xmath18 going to zero ( see , e.g. , blanc , le bris & lions @xcite or braides & cicalese @xcite ) . usually , there is a natural choice of sequence of @xmath18 going to zero . in this paper , we calculate all the possible limits according to the particular sequence of @xmath18 going to zero . in the next two lemmas ,",

    "this section analyses the terms @xmath386 and @xmath387 of theorem [ th : k1 ] .",
    "as we explained in section [ se : repulsion ] , it is not clear how to define the atomistic deformation in the region between two sharp interfaces . in theorem",
    "[ th : k1 ] , we assumed that , in that region , the atomistic deformation @xmath39 followed a scaling of a given discrete deformation @xmath388 , but the actual values of @xmath42 were left unspecified .",
    "we believe that @xmath42 should be such that the difference of energy @xmath389 is minimum .",
    "as this is a difficult problem , we approximate @xmath389 by its taylor expansion , and , thanks to theorem [ th : k1 ] , we choose @xmath42 to be a minimiser of @xmath386 . for every @xmath44 ,",
    "this is a finite - dimensional minimisation problem , and it will turn out that , in many cases , the optimal choice of @xmath42 is the identity map , which gives @xmath52 as the optimal value for @xmath386 .",
    "as explained in section [ se : intro ] , the repulsion term between two sharp interfaces should be decreasing with respect to the distance between them , and tend to infinity as the interface goes to zero .",
    "since we have here a discrete variable @xmath44 that runs over @xmath390 , the latter property makes no sense , but we still can expect that the repulsion term is decreasing with respect to @xmath44 , at least for small values of @xmath44 . in the context of theorem",
    "[ th : k1 ] , the repulsion term is defined as @xmath389 , but again we approximate it by its taylor expansion @xmath391 . as explained in the previous paragraph , the term @xmath386 provides us with information about the optimal shape of @xmath42 ( which in many cases turns out to be the identity ) , but does not give much information about the repulsion energy ( because in many cases it is zero ) or about @xmath44 ( because in many cases the optimal value of @xmath386 is @xmath52 , regardless of @xmath44 ) .",
    "thus , we will study the term @xmath387 and it will turn out that , in a particular but important case , the optimal @xmath44 is @xmath33 .      given a function @xmath392 and a natural number @xmath32 , we define @xmath393 and @xmath394 as @xmath395   \\\\ & + \\sum_{i=1}^{m-2 } \\sum_{j = i+1}^{m-1 } w \\left ( b m ( x_j - x_i ) \\right )   + \\sum_{i=1}^{m-1 } \\sum_{j = m}^{\\infty } w \\left ( b \\left [ j - m x_i \\right ] \\right ) - ( m-1 ) \\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty } w(b j ) , \\end{split}\\ ] ] for each @xmath396 and @xmath397 for which all the series of converge . of course , the reason of this definition is that , according to theorem [ th : k1 ] and specifically , and following the notation there , @xmath398 in the next lemma we study the minimisers of @xmath399",
    ". as we will see , the point @xmath400 defined by @xmath401 will play an important role .",
    "[ le : d2 ] suppose that @xmath402 satisfies @xmath403 for some @xmath404 .",
    "let @xmath32 be a natural number .",
    "define , and @xmath394 as .",
    "let @xmath405 .",
    "then there exists a minimiser of @xmath406 in @xmath407 .",
    "moreover , @xmath408 and @xmath409 . finally , @xmath410    the assumptions imply that @xmath399 is of class @xmath411 , and , for each @xmath396 we have @xmath412 as @xmath413 with @xmath414 .",
    "this implies the existence of minimisers of @xmath415 in @xmath407 .",
    "the rest of the lemma follows from a direct calculation .",
    "the next step would be to compute the minimisers of @xmath415 and to ascertain whether or not the point @xmath416 is a ( local or global ) minimiser of @xmath417 .",
    "the answer to these questions depends on @xmath12 , @xmath304 and @xmath306 ; all we can say is that @xmath416 is not , in general , a critical point of @xmath418 for @xmath396 with @xmath419 . since we do not think that there is a general answer to these questions , from now on we will concentrate on a specific example .    let @xmath287 and let @xmath288 be the lennard - jones potential defined in",
    "from now on , for each natural @xmath342 , let the function @xmath399 defined in refer to the potential @xmath293 .",
    "then , a direct computation shows that , for all @xmath282 , @xmath420 @xmath421 .\\ ] ] based on those formulas and in sylvester s criterion , we find that @xmath422 @xmath423 here we are using the following notation : if @xmath424 is a symmetric matrix , by @xmath425 we mean that @xmath424 is positive definite .",
    "thus , we have a necessary and a sufficient condition for @xmath416 to be a local minimiser of @xmath417 , for each @xmath426 .",
    "in fact , numerical experiments with the software mathematica @xcite suggest that @xmath427 if and only if @xmath428 , if and only if @xmath429 , where the numerical value of @xmath430 is shown in table [ ta : am ] .",
    "our interpretation is the following .",
    "for the lennard - jones potential , when @xmath431 , then the optimal discrete configuration between two sharp interfaces separated at a distance @xmath47 is close to @xmath416 . if , in addition @xmath432 then the optimal @xmath44 is @xmath33 , whereas if @xmath433 then the models predicts that no interfaces at all ( i.e. , @xmath434 ) is energetically better .",
    "so this model predicts that the optimal length of the space between interfaces is @xmath33 times the atomistic distance , which coincides with the experiments of baele , van tendeloo and amelinckx @xcite .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank john ball for having proposed this problem to me and for many stimulating discussions .",
