    ", it defines a class of quantum invariants for hyperbolic knots , dependent on a continuous parameter @xmath5 . the level @xmath0 teichmller tqft is an analogously upgarde of representations in quantum teichmller theory and it depends on a pair of parameters @xmath6 , one continuous and one discrete .",
    "such quantum theory is related to the level @xmath0 chern ",
    "simons theory with gauge group @xmath1 via the level @xmath0 weil - gelfand - zak transform .",
    "such a relation was proposed in @xcite , and here we show it in a more tight way for the four punctured sphere .",
    "one of the main ingredient in the construct of the teichmller tqft is the _ quantum dilogarithm _ , that is a function @xmath7 , satisfying some particular properties .",
    "such functions were introduced in @xcite , which for @xmath3 is faddeev s original quantum dilogarithm .",
    "the theory we get has different and interesting unitarity behaviour depending on the pair of parameters @xmath8 : for level @xmath3 the theory is unitary whenever @xmath9 or @xmath10 while for higher level @xmath11 the unitarity is only manifest when @xmath12 while in the case @xmath13 the behaviour is more exotic .",
    "we will consider both situations here and we will use the setting @xmath9 to present some asymptotic properties in the limit @xmath14 .",
    "the teichmller tqft can be used to define knot invariants starting from triangulations of their complements . in this presentation",

    "it is an interesting challenge how the tqft s which are reviewed in this paper are related to the witten - reshetikhin - turaev tqft s @xcite and in particular how they are related to the geometric construction of these tqft s @xcite and to witten s proposal for the construction of the complex quantum chern - simons theory @xcite , which can actually be constructed from a purely mathematical point of view @xcite , resulting also in the mathematically well - defined hitchin - witten connection in the bundle of quantizations of the moduli space of flat @xmath15-connections over teichmller space . in the classical case of compact groups ,",
    "the description of the representations of the mapping class groups via the monodromy of the hitchin connections turned out to be very useful to prove deep properties about these representations @xcite , some of which also uses the theory of toeplitz operators @xcite .",
    "understanding how these kinds of results can be extended to the complex quantum theory discused in this paper will be very interesting and most likely involve using higgs bundles techniques @xcite .",
    "certainly we have already seen the start of this with the verlinde formula for higgs bundle moduli space @xcite .",

    "the function @xmath16 was introduced in @xcite for the first time , but some of its properties that we list here are not present in the literature . in section [ sc : modelspace ]",
    "we carry out the quantization of the moduli space of @xmath1 flat connections over a four punctured sphere with unipotent holonomies around the punctures .",
    "we follow the prescriptions of geometric quantisation , together with a choice of real polarisation , and we connect the resulting algebra of observables to the @xmath17 representations of quantum teichmller theory of the previous section . finally in section [ ch : tqft ] we construct the the teichmller tqft functor @xmath18 mirroring the construction in @xcite and we study some examples and their asymptotic behaviour .",
