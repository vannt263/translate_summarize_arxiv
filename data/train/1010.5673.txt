    "let @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote an up step and a down step , respectively . in @xcite , denise and simion introduced and investigated the two statistics ` pyramid weight ' and ` number of exterior pairs ' on the set @xmath0 .",
    "a _ pyramid _ in a dyck path is a section of the form @xmath14 , a succession of @xmath2 up steps followed immediately by @xmath2 down steps , where @xmath2 is called the _ height _ of the pyramid .",
    "the pyramid is _ maximal _ if it is not contained in a higher pyramid .",
    "the _ pyramid weight _ of a dyck path is the sum of the heights of its maximal pyramids .",
    "exterior pair _ in a dyck path is a pair consisting of an up step and its matching down step which do not belong to any pyramid .",
    "for example , the path shown in figure [ fig : pyramid ] contains three maximal pyramids with a total weight of 4 and two exterior pairs .",
    "since a dyck path in @xmath0 with a pyramid weight of @xmath15 contains @xmath16 exterior pairs , both of the statistics are essentially equidistributed on the set @xmath0 .",
    "however , they seem to be ` isolated ' from other statistics in the sense that so far there are no known statistics that share the same distribution with them . in the first part of this work , we discover one and establish an explicit connection with the statistic ` number of exterior pairs ' .    for a dyck path , an up step that rises from the line @xmath17 to the line @xmath18",
    "is said to be at _ height _ @xmath2 .",
    "it is well known @xcite that the number of paths in @xmath0 with @xmath15 up steps at even height is enumerated by the _ narayana number _",
    "@xmath19 for @xmath20 .",

    "* figure 2.4 ) ) .",
    "in addition to an algebraic proof by the method of generating functions ( see example [ exa : gfproof ] ) , one of the main results in this paper is a bijective proof of the equidistribution of these two statistics ( theorem [ thm : main-2 ] ) , which is established by a recursive construction . to our knowledge , it is not equivalent to any previously known bijection on the set @xmath0 .",

    "it follows immediately that the two statistics ` number of up step at even height ' and ` number of up steps at odd height ' are equidistributed on the set @xmath0 .",
    "specifically , the number of paths in @xmath0 with @xmath15 steps at even height equals the number of paths with @xmath31 up steps at odd height .",

    "in this section , we shall establish the bijection requested in theorem [ thm : main-2 ] .",
    "a _ block _ of a dyck path is a section beginning with an up step whose starting point is on the @xmath11-axis and ending with the first down step that returns to the @xmath11-axis afterward .",
    "dyck paths that have exactly one block are called _",
    "primitive_. we remark that the requested bijection is established for primitive dyck paths first and then for ordinary ones in a block - by - block manner .",
    "in fact , the bijection is constructed in terms of ordered trees .",

    "a vertex with no children is called a _ leaf_. by a _ planted ( ordered ) tree _ we mean an ordered tree whose root has only one child .",

    "it is easy to see that the dyck path corresponding to a planted tree is primitive .",
    "the _ level _ of edge @xmath63 is defined to be the distance from the root to the end vertex @xmath58 .",
    "the _ height _ of @xmath56 is the highest level of the edges of @xmath56 .",
