    "galactic open star clusters are a key laboratory for observationally constraining models of stellar evolution .",
    "the open cluster ngc 6791 resides in a sparsely populated area of the age and metallicity parameter space with its unique combination of old age ( @xmath08 gyr ; @xcite ) and high metallicity ( [ fe / h]=+0.30 ; @xcite ) .",
    "as such , it has been the subject of many photometric surveys , spectroscopic studies @xcite , eclipsing binary studies @xcite , variable star surveys @xcite , and an x - ray binary survey @xcite .",
    "falling within the _ kepler _ field @xcite , ngc 6791 also has asteroseismic measurements of select red giant ( rg ) and red clump ( rc ) stars @xcite .    with this wealth of data , ngc 6791",
    "has proven difficult to describe in terms of a single - age stellar population .",

    "* ) , red stragglers ( sub - subgiants ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , young white dwarfs @xcite , and extreme horizontal branch ( ehb ) and blue - horizontal branch stars in addition to a rich rc make this open cluster a popular target of observers and theorists alike .",
    "the potential presence of ehb stars , for instance , may make ngc 6791 our closest analog in studying the ultraviolet upturn of elliptical galaxies @xcite . with a diversity of stellar sources for study ,",
    "secure membership determinations remain a foremost priority before extensive future analyses .",
    "the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter p11 ) proper - motion ( pm ) study provides the first comprehensive , kinematic membership determination for ngc 6791 .",
    "a previous pm study by was limited to only the inner @xmath8 .",
    "other memberships based on radial - velocity ( rv ) measurements , eclipsing binaries , spectroscopically derived stellar parameters , and/or asteroseismic measurements have , thus far , been limited to small sample sizes .",
    "a surprising finding of the p11 study was a proposed population of 12 horizontal branch stars ( 7 having proper - motion membership probabilities above 90% ) extending blueward continuously from the rc into the bss domain ( hereafter referred to as blue - hb candidates ) . given the high metallicity of the cluster ( [ fe / h]@xmath9 ) , core helium - burning stars are expected to reside within the rc , making this seeming horizontal branch an anomaly .",
    "@xcite point out that in a johnson @xmath10 color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) a model zero - age horizontal branch is more luminous than the locus of blue - hb stars proposed by p11 .",
    "these authors suggest that the blue - hb candidates must instead be bsss . inconsistencies like this motivate our investigation into the nature of these stars using multi - epoch , high - resolution spectroscopy .    through the wiyn open cluster study ( wocs ; * ?",

    ", we define secure , three - dimensional kinematic memberships for a complete stellar sample including rgs , hb stars , and bsss .",
    "our ongoing survey allows us to also characterize the binary population and determine the cluster s radial - velocity dispersion from which we derive the first dynamical mass estimate for this cluster",
    ". our paper is structured as follows : section [ sample ] describes our survey sample , section [ obs+dr ] details our observation and data reduction scheme , and section [ comp ] presents our observation completeness .",
    "sections [ results ] and [ disc ] present our results and discussion , respectively , and a summary of our conclusions is provided in section [ conc ] .",
    "the source catalog for our rv survey of ngc 6791 is drawn from the pm study of p11 . in this study ,",
    "deep photographic plates dating back to 1961 from the kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) 4 m and the lick 3 m telescopes , along with ccd mosaic frames taken from 19982009 with the kpno 4 m and the 3.6 m canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) , were used to obtain high - precision proper motions for 58,901 stars down to @xmath12 . within the 0.8 deg@xmath13 field of view ( fov ) , a total of 5,699 pm probable cluster members were found based on the chosen cluster membership probabilities combined with certain cmd restrictions ( figure 1 in p11 ) . in general , stars with pm membership probabilities @xmath14 were taken to be probable cluster members , although a looser constraint of @xmath15 was used for stars falling on the main sequence .",
    "the complete catalog of positions , proper motions , membership probabilities , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 photometry will appear in i. platais et al .",

    "we trim the full sample only by excluding @xmath19 sources , assuming they are field stars .",
    "this assumption is supported by the cmd of @xmath19 stars , presented in figure 1 , which lacks apparent cluster features such as the rgb .",
    "the cmd membership cut of @xmath20 used by p11 , aimed to minimize the field contamination expected in low-@xmath21 sources . in the @xmath22 sample , however , some cluster members are indeed expected .",

    "here we briefly present our observing and data reduction procedures .",
    "( we refer readers to @xcite for full details . )",
    "variations in our methods from previous wocs rv papers are given below .",
    "our ongoing spectroscopic survey of ngc 6791 has , to date , yielded 1189 rv measurements of 260 stars .",
    "observations utilize the hydra multi - object spectrograph ( mos ) on the wiyn 3.5 m telescope , capable of obtaining @xmath070 stellar spectra simultaneously over a 1@xmath24 field of view .",
    "we use @xmath25 diameter fibers along with the bench spectrograph echelle grating , resulting in a spectral resolution of @xmath020,000 ( 15 km s@xmath4 ) . due to the number of source fibers , the echelle grating",
    "is not cross - dispersed and the x14 filter is used to isolate the 11th spectral order .",
    "this 250  - wide region centered at 5125   contains many stellar absorption lines including the mg i b triplet .    to begin our observing program , the catalog is split into bright ( @xmath26 ) and faint ( @xmath27 ) sub - samples to prevent on - chip contamination between source spectra .",
    "bright and faint hydra configurations generated from these sub - samples are observed for 1 and 2 hours , respectively , to ensure a sufficient signal - to - noise ratio ( s /",
    "n @xmath28 per resolution element under ideal observing conditions for all targets ) .",
    "integrations are split into three equal exposures to reduce the impact of cosmic ray contamination .",
    "of the 81 available fibers , each configuration observes a maximum of 71 stellar spectra with 10 fibers reserved for sky sampling . as accurate wavelength calibration is vital to this program s success , comparison thar emission lamp spectra are taken before and after each configuration to correct for wavelength shifts during the observing sequence .",
    "dome flat - field images are also taken for each configuration to aid in throughput correction and aperture identification during spectral extraction .",
    "target prioritization aims to efficiently determine the rv membership of proper - motion - selected stars .",
    "monte carlo ( mc ) simulations have shown that 3 observations over the course of 200 days can determine , to @xmath090% confidence , whether a star has a constant or variable rv for binary orbital periods up to 1000 days .",
    "as such , for a given observing run , we place stars with one observation at the highest priority followed by twice - observed likely members ( stars whose first two rv measurements fall within the cluster s rv distribution ) , twice - observed likely non - members , unobserved stars , and finally , stars with three or more observations over the course of at least 200 days .",
    "the 12 blue - hb candidates from p11 were given the highest priority until their rv memberships were determined .",
    "unlike previous wocs rv studies , we have not yet chosen to prioritize binary orbit determinations for velocity - variable stars in favor of maximizing the number of single stars with determined rv memberships .",
    "stars with the highest pm probabilities were also prioritized in our observations .",
    "all wocs image processing and data reduction are completed using standard iraf tasks .",
    "our routine is as follows .",
    "bias subtraction from an overscan region is first applied to raw science and flat - field images .",
    "spectral extraction , flat - field correction , throughput correction , and dispersion solutions are computed and applied with the _ dohydra _ reduction task .",
    "remaining sky fibers are visually inspected for quality and median combined to perform sky subtraction . the three fully reduced spectra from each configuration are then median combined to improve s / n and remove cosmic ray contamination .",
    "fourier cross - correlation functions ( ccf ) between stellar spectra and a zero - velocity template are computed using the iraf task _",
    "fxcor_. a gaussian fit to the ccf peak provides the relative velocity shift between the two spectra , which is then corrected for the earth s orbital motion to produce a heliocentric rv . @xcite",
    "define a minimum ccf peak height of 0.4 as sufficient correlation for a secure rv measurement utilizing the same observational and data reduction schemes .",
    "we adopt this same minimum ccf peak value to identify acceptable rv measurements .",
    "finally , systematic fiber - to - fiber rv offsets derived by @xcite are then applied to the computed heliocentric rv , yielding our final rv measurement .    in the case of double - lined spectroscopic binaries , we are able to retrieve the radial velocities of both stars simultaneously using the two - dimensional correlation routine todcor . using a zero - velocity template for each star",
    ", we fit a two - dimensional correlation that is able to effectively decompose strongly blended lines .",
    "the result of this routine is a heliocentric rv for each star in the system that is then corrected for fiber - fiber variations .    as in previous wocs surveys , the standard fourier cross - correlation template is a high - s / n solar spectrum from a sky flat . for most stars in the ngc 6791 sample , a strong correlation peak is found using the solar template .",
    "however , a handful of rgs in our sample exhibit the swan c@xmath29 absorption band near 5165  that prevents precise rv measurements against a solar template .",
    "for this subset , we use the spectrum of the k1 iii star , hd172171 , from the publicly available elodie stellar library as our template .",
    "this spectrum is provided at zero - velocity and is set to a zero - heliocentric - velocity for cross - correlation .",
    "containing the same c@xmath29 absorption feature and at a spectral resolution of @xmath042,000 , we retrieve strong correlation peaks for this subset of rgs in our sample .",
    "additionally , the rv zero - points for cluster members found using the solar and rg template are consistent .",
    "model within the @xmath30 cutoff represented by the dashed vertical line . a best - fit precision of @xmath31 km s@xmath4 is found .",

    "the velocity variability of binary stars in our sample inflates the tail of our error distribution with sources of high measurement deviation . to account for this",
    ", we fit @xmath33 only to data within a @xmath30 cutoff to limit binary contamination .",
    "varying @xmath30 at 0.1 km s@xmath4 intervals we find that a value of @xmath37 km s@xmath4 produces the lowest residuals in the fit and we adopt this value as our cutoff .",

    "contamination from velocity variables can be clearly seen exceeding the @xmath33 fit beyond the cutoff .",
    "we find a best - fit precision of @xmath31 km s@xmath4 that is insensitive to the value of @xmath30 chosen , producing a consistent result for @xmath38 km s@xmath4 .",
    "our best - fit measurement precision is consistent with that found in the @xcite study of ngc 188 ( @xmath39 km s@xmath4 ) .    from our rv precision",
    ", we define a minimum standard deviation in observed rv for a star to be characterized as a `` velocity - variable '' . as in @xcite , we use the quantity @xmath40 to define velocity variables where @xmath41 is the observed standard deviation of a given star ( @xmath42 ) and @xmath43 denotes our precision ( @xmath32 ) . stars with @xmath44 are designated as velocity variables .",
    "the @xmath40 limit is plotted as the vertical dotted line in figure [ fig : precision ] , where stars falling right of this line are considered to be velocity variable .",
    "by combining precise rv and pm memberships , we seek to define a complete sample of the evolved stellar population within a radius of @xmath11 ( @xmath035 pc at @xmath45 kpc ) from the cluster center .",
    "we adopt the @xcite cluster center in the following analysis ( @xmath46 ; j2000 ) , which is within @xmath47 from our independent estimate . within the magnitude range of our sample ( see section 2 ) , there are 280 sources ( @xmath48 ) . of these ,",
    "93% have at least one rv measurement and 79% have @xmath49 3 measurements over the course of at least 200 days .",
    "as stated above , we have presumed that stars with @xmath19 are securely not cluster members .    achieving 3 rv measurements over the course of at least 200 days",
    "is required to determine , with @xmath090% confidence , whether a star is velocity variable . since rv membership probabilities are only computed for non - velocity - variable stars ( section [ membership ] ) ,",
    "this observational benchmark sets the completeness for which we can determine membership or binarity .",
    "distributions of rv measurement completeness with respect to radius and @xmath16 magnitude are presented in the left and right panels of figure [ fig : comp ] , respectively .",
    "the dashed line represents completeness with @xmath50 measurement .",
    "completeness with @xmath49 3 measurements over 200 days is shown as the solid line .",
    "radius is given in arcminutes ( bottom ) and in core radii ( top ) based on the p11 derivation of @xmath51 pc from king model fitting @xcite to the stellar number - density profile ( assuming a distance of 4 kpc , 1=1.16pc ; @xcite ) .",
    "the cluster tidal radius ( @xmath027 pc ; p11 ) is also presented as the vertical dot - dashed line .",
    "the decline in rv measurement completeness at small radii and at faint magnitudes is due to the same population of dim , centrally concentrated stars .",
    "observations of these stars are limited by the number of hydra fibers that can be placed in the dense cluster center , compounded with the time expense of obtaining 2 hr exposures for faint stars .",

    "<S> , we present precise ( @xmath3 km s@xmath4 ) radial velocities for proper - motion candidate members of ngc 6791 from platais et al . our survey , extending down to @xmath5 , is comprised of the evolved cluster population , including blue stragglers , giants , and horizontal branch stars . of the 280 proper - motion - selected stars above our magnitude limit , 93% have at least one radial - velocity measurement and 79% have three measurements over the course of at least 200 days , sufficient for secure radial - velocity - determined membership of non - velocity - variable stars . </S>",
    "<S> the platais et al . </S>",
    "<S> proper - motion catalog includes twelve anomalous horizontal branch candidates blueward of the red clump , of which we find only four to be cluster members . </S>",
    "<S> three fall slightly blueward of the red clump and the fourth is consistent with being a blue straggler . </S>",
    "<S> the cleaned color - magnitude diagram shows a richly populated red giant branch and a blue straggler population . </S>",
    "<S> half of the blue stragglers are in binaries . from our radial - velocity measurement distribution </S>",
    "<S> we find the cluster s radial - velocity dispersion to be @xmath6 km s@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to a dynamical mass of @xmath04600 @xmath7 . </S>"
