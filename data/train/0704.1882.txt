    "over the past decade , the `` power of choice '' has emerged as a theme in research on optimization and randomized algorithms  @xcite . consider a random decision process . typically at each step of the process",
    "a decision is reached by choosing one outcome at random and accepting this choice .",
    "now , rather then one random alternative being presented at each decision point , let a small set of randomly generated alternatives be presented , and let the best one be selected .",
    "it has been shown that with as few as two alternatives at each decision point , the resulting properties of the process can be radically altered .",
    "this was first explored in the context of load - balancing the allocation of jobs arriving at random times to a batch of processors . with as few as two choices , the maximum load on any one processor drops dramatically from @xmath6 to @xmath3 . increasing the number of choices beyond two",
    "only improves this by a constant factor , illustrating the `` power of two choices . ''    here we explore the effect of choice on random network growth . perhaps the simplest way to build a growing random network",
    "is to attach each new node to an existing node which is chosen uniformly at random .",
    "this process generates _ random recursive trees _ which have been studied in great detail ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "here we discuss a simple generalization : for each new node we choose @xmath7 existing ` contact ' nodes uniformly at random , select the ` best ' one according to some definition , and connect the new node to it .",
    "this creates a random tree  @xcite whose statistics may be very different from those of a random recursive tree .",
    "we have to define , of course , the ` quality ' of the node so that we can choose the best one .",
    "one natural definition of quality in a tree is distance to the root  the closer to the root , the better , so that the new node attaches to whichever one of its contacts is closest to the root ( and , if more than one contact has this smallest distance , we choose one of them randomly ) .",
    "this could correspond , for instance , to someone joining a hierarchical organization , and choosing to become a daughter node of whichever one of their @xmath0 contacts is highest up in the hierarchy .",
    "another natural definition is to measure quality by degree of the contact node : for instance , to attach the new node to the contact node with highest degree , again breaking ties randomly .",
    "note that this is very different from the preferential attachment process  @xcite , where the contact is selected from the entire graph with probability proportional to its degree .",
    "this latter process requires complete knowledge of the degree of all existing nodes .",
    "in contrast , our model assumes that the new node possesses only a small amount of local information , namely , the degrees of a small number of potential contacts .",
    "this brings us to another motivation for this work : the desire to understand the effects of limited , local information on network growth . for the smallest - depth model",
    ", we find a marked difference in behavior for @xmath8 versus @xmath9 .",
    "the measure of interest in this case is the depth distribution ( the fraction of nodes at each depth @xmath10 ) . for @xmath9 , _",
    "i.e. _ , a random recursive tree , this distribution is poisson . for @xmath8 , the same poisson distribution is observed for distances close to the root , however for larger distances the depth distribution obeys a traveling wave solution .",
    "we also consider using _ maximal _ depth , rather than minimal depth , as the contact node selection criterion and find a similar traveling - wave solution .    for the highest - degree model , we find that the degree distribution decays exponentially for degree @xmath11 .",
    "for @xmath12 the degree distribution exhibits power - law like behavior , thus in order to observe a power law for any substantial regime requires @xmath13 . in other words , a large amount of ( overhead / state / knowledge of the system )",
    "is required to achieve a power law distribution .    finally , in analogy to the above - referenced works on load balancing",
    ", the lowest - degree model achieves a degree distribution which is very close to uniform , in which the maximum degree in the entire graph is @xmath3 as opposed to the maximum degree in a poisson distribution , which is roughly @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath14 be the total number of nodes and @xmath15 be the number of nodes at distance @xmath10 from the root . by definition , @xmath16 , since the root is distance 0 from itself .",
    "thus @xmath17 is a deterministic quantity , while @xmath15 with @xmath18 are random variables .",
    "we shall focus on their averages @xmath19 .",
    "an average value provides a good description of a random variable when it is large and hence fluctuations are relatively small ; we will see that this is indeed correct for @xmath20 .    to set the stage we begin in sect .",
    "[ rrt ] with the simpler case of random recursive trees , for which everything is already known ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we then consider the influence of @xmath21 or more choices in sect .",
    "[ choice ] .",
    "the quantity @xmath22 grows each time a node at distance @xmath23 is selected as the contact node .",
    "the average depth distribution thus satisfies the master equation @xcite @xmath24 this equation is _ exact _ and it applies even for @xmath25 if we set . using the recursive nature of  ,",
    "we first solve for @xmath26 , then @xmath27 , _",
    "etc_. this gives @xmath28 equivalently , we can recast the @xmath10-fold sums into simple sums , although the results look less neat .",
    "for example ,    @xmath29     \\label{q2-rrt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath30 are harmonic numbers .",
    "the asymptotic behaviors of @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and other harmonic numbers are well - known  @xcite , and the resulting asymptotics of the depth distribution are @xmath33 + \\cdots , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the euler - mascheroni constant .",
    "analogous results hold for @xmath35 for larger @xmath10 .",
    "if we merely want to establish the leading asymptotic behavior , we can replace the summation in   by integration .",
    "this leads to the simple result @xmath36 showing that in the limit @xmath37 , the depth distribution is poisson with mean @xmath38 .",
    "alternatively , we can derive   within a continuum approach by replacing finite differences by derivatives in the @xmath39 limit of  .",
    "this procedure recasts discrete master equations into differential equations @xmath40 solving   one recovers  .",
    "the normalization requirement @xmath41 implies the sum rule for the averages @xmath42 the continuum approximation   agrees with the sum rule   implying that it well approximates the depth distribution in the entire range .",
    "we therefore use it to find the depth of the recursive random tree .",
    "the depth is defined as the maximal @xmath43 .",
    "the criterion @xmath44 leads to an estimate  @xcite @xmath45 it is possible to derive this result within the exact ( discrete ) approach and to determine the fluctuations of @xmath43 .",
    "however , for our purposes   is sufficient .",
    "now suppose the new node has @xmath2 choices . in this case",
    ", we have @xmath46 if the two contact nodes have minimum depth @xmath23 , or equivalently , if both of them have depth at least @xmath23 , but if they do not both have depth greater than @xmath23 .",
    "the probability of this is @xmath47   \\nonumber \\\\ = \\ ; & n^{-2 } \\left ( d_{j-1}^2 + 2d_{j-1}\\sum_{i\\geq j}d_i \\right ) \\enspace .",
    "\\label{growth } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this leads to the exact recurrence @xmath48 unfortunately , this is not very helpful since the average of the product of random quantities differs from the product of their averages , viz .",
    "one can , of course , write down an exact recurrence for @xmath50 , but this involves third order moments @xmath51 , and so on",
    ". thus the hierarchical nature of the governing equations does not allow us to obtain complete and rigorous results as is possible for the case @xmath9 .    the cases of @xmath52",
    "are exceptional and one can determine @xmath53 and @xmath54 analytically .",
    "for @xmath55 the analysis is especially simple since @xmath56 , and the growth rate   simplifies to @xmath57/n^2 $ ] .",
    "therefore the average number of the neighbors of the root grows according to an exact and closed recurrence @xmath58 solving   subject to @xmath59 yields @xmath60 similarly for @xmath61 we use relation @xmath62 and obtain @xmath63 to obtain a closed recurrence for @xmath54 we need to determine @xmath64 , the average of the square of the number of neighbors of the root . then   leads to @xmath65 squaring this equation and averaging we obtain @xmath66\\\\ & = & \\langle d_1 ^ 2(n)\\rangle+2\\frac{2n-1}{n^2}\\,q_1(n)+\\frac{2n-1}{n^2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] rather than directly solving this recurrence , we can use it together with   to establish a simpler recurrence for the variance @xmath67 .",
    "we find @xmath68 which is readily solved to give @xmath69 thus @xmath70 , yet the variance is asymptotically @xmath71 and therefore fluctuations of the random variable @xmath72 are indeed small compared to its average which grows as @xmath71 , see  .",
    "we determined @xmath73 and therefore @xmath54 satisfies a closed solvable recurrence  .",

    "if we are seeking only the leading behavior , however , we can proceed .",
    "when @xmath76 and @xmath10 is sufficiently small , namely such that @xmath77 , we can replace the sum @xmath78 by @xmath14 and the growth rate   by @xmath79 .",
    "thus we arrive at a set of differential equations @xmath80 solving these equations we obtain @xmath81 we check the validity of this approximation by substituting it back into our assumption @xmath77 which we used in the derivation of  .",
    "this suggests that   holds when @xmath82 ( _ i.e. _ , for small distances from the root ) where @xmath83 is the smallest positive root of @xmath84 we can write @xmath83 in terms of lambert s function @xmath85 , defined as the root of @xmath86 : @xmath87 where @xmath88 denotes the @xmath4st branch of the lambert function .",
    "numerically , @xmath89    when @xmath90 we can not use  .",
    "however , as long as @xmath91 is much larger than 1 , let us assume that the fluctuations in @xmath22 are small . in that case we can replace averages @xmath92 by @xmath93 , and in this regime we obtain @xmath94 it is convenient to introduce the cumulative variable @xmath95 that is",
    ", the average fraction of nodes whose depth is at least @xmath10 . summing   over all @xmath96 we arrive at a neat recurrence @xmath97",
    "the form of this equation suggests the introduction of a new ` time ' variable @xmath98 this transformation recasts   into @xmath99 which should be solved subject to the step function initial condition : @xmath100 for @xmath101 and @xmath102 for @xmath103 .",
    "equation   has appeared in various contexts ( see e.g.  @xcite ) and while it is unsolvable , an asymptotic behavior of its solution is understood . in the long time limit ,",
    "the solution approaches a ` traveling wave ' form , @xmath104 plugging   into   one finds that @xmath105 satisfies @xmath106 the boundary conditions are @xmath107 the boundary - value problem   is still intractable analytically .",
    "however , the velocity @xmath83 can be determined even without a complete solution for @xmath105 .",
    "the method relies on the analysis of the tail region @xmath108 .",
    "one notices that   admits an exponential solution in this region , @xmath109 plugging this into   shows that the velocity @xmath83 is related to @xmath110 via the dispersion relation  @xcite @xmath111 the maximum of @xmath112 is given by   and it occurs at the largest positive root @xmath110 of the transcendental equation @xmath113 .",

    "however , the so - called _ selection principle _ tells us that this extremal value is realized for any initial conditions which vanish sufficiently rapidly at infinity .",
    "the selection principle has been rigorously proven for a few nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations . yet",
    "heuristic arguments and numerical evidence indicate that the its range of applicability is much broader .",
    "this is reviewed in  @xcite in the context of partial differential equations and in  @xcite in the context of difference equations .",
    "thus there is a sharp front at depth @xmath117 to leading order , where the depth of most nodes in the tree is concentrated .",
    "furthermore , the width of this front remains finite even in the limit @xmath118 .",
    "it is also possible to compute the sub - leading correction to the position of the front  @xcite , giving an improved estimate of its location : @xmath119 to estimate the _ maximum _ depth @xmath43 , it is necessary to bound the tail of @xmath105 in the positive direction @xmath120 . to do this , note that by definition @xmath105 is monotonically decreasing , and by   this implies that @xmath121 and therefore that this tail is doubly exponential , @xmath122 for some constant @xmath123 . setting @xmath124 then gives the estimate @xmath125 minus a constant @xmath126 . as shown in fig .",

    "this is , however , an illusion .",
    "first of all , the distribution   for random recursive trees is indeed poissonian while   is valid only for @xmath128 .",
    "secondly , while both types of trees have depth @xmath127 , choice causes the depth to be much more concentrated .",
    "this is easiest to see if we consider the cumulative depth distribution  . for random recursive trees ,",
    "@xmath129 is asymptotically @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the error function @xmath132 thus @xmath133 the boundary layer where @xmath134 changes from one to zero is not a true front as its width grows with ` time ' as @xmath135 .",
    "on the other hand , for the model with choice the cumulative depth distribution has a traveling wave shape with a front of _ constant _ width .",
    "thus @xmath136",
    "what if the new node has more than two choices ?",

    "we now consider a model in which quality is measured not by depth , but by the degree of the contact node  the higher the degree , the better .",
    "as we will show below , in this case the degree distribution exhibits a power law up to degree @xmath175 , beyond which it decays exponentially .",
    "therefore , in this model we need a large number of choices , @xmath5 , in order to observe a power law over a wide range of degrees .",

    "<S> each new node has @xmath0 randomly chosen contacts , where @xmath1 is a constant . </S>",
    "<S> it then attaches to whichever one of these contacts is most desirable in some sense , such as its distance from the root or its degree . even when the new node has just two choices , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , when @xmath2 , the resulting network can be very different from a random graph or tree . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , if the new node attaches to the contact which is closest to the root of the tree , the distribution of depths changes from poisson to a traveling wave solution . </S>",
    "<S> if the new node attaches to the contact with the smallest degree , the degree distribution is closer to uniform than in a random graph , so that with high probability there are no nodes in the network with degree greater than @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , if the new node attaches to the contact with the largest degree , we find that the degree distribution is a power law with exponent @xmath4 up to degrees roughly equal to @xmath0 , with an exponential cutoff beyond that ; thus , in this case , we need @xmath5 to see a power law over a wide range of degrees . </S>"
