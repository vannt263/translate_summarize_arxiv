    "although first synthesized in the 1980s , single molecular magnets ( smms )  @xcite did not get much attention until the beginning of the 1990s , when their unusual magnetic properties were discovered  @xcite . owing to large spin and high anisotropy barrier , smms in a time dependent magnetic field",
    "were shown to exhibit magnetic hysteresis loops with characteristic steps caused by the effect of quantum tunneling of magnetization .",
    "current interest in smms is a consequence of recent progress in nanotechnology , which enables to attach electrodes to a single molecule and investigate its transport properties  @xcite .",
    "physical properties of smms and their nanoscale size make them a promising candidate for future applications in information storage and information processing , as well as in various spintronics devices  @xcite .",
    "magnetic switching of a smm due to quantum tunneling of magnetization in a magnetic field varying linearly in time was considered theoretically long time ago and was also studied experimentally  @xcite . from both practical and fundamental reasons it would be , however , interesting to have a possibility of switching the smm without external magnetic field .",
    "such a possibility is offered by a spin polarized current . as it is already well known , spin polarized current can switch magnetic layers in spin valve structures , like for instance magnetic nanopillars  @xcite .",
    "the main objective of this paper is just to investigate theoretically the mechanism of smm s spin reversal due to spin polarized current .    as a simplest system for current - induced molecular switching we consider a smm embedded in the barrier between ferromagnetic electrodes ( called also leads in the following ) .",
    "when voltage is applied , the charge current flowing in the system is associated with a spin current . in this paper we show that this spin current can lead to magnetic switching of the smm , when the voltage surpasses a certain threshold value .",
    "moreover , when bias increases ( linearly ) in time , the switching can be observed in the corresponding current - voltage characteristics as an additional feature ( dip or peak ) in the current .",
    "it is worth to note that spin polarized transport through artificial quantum dots attached to ferromagnetic leads was extensively studied in recent few years , mostly theoretically  @xcite , though some experimental data are already available  @xcite .",
    "however , investigations of spin polarized electronic transport through molecules , and particularly through magnetic ones , are in early stage of development .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the model hamiltonian assumed to describe a molecule interacting with magnetic leads",
    ". theoretical analysis of electric current flowing through the system under consideration is carried out in section 3 .",
    "numerical results on electric current and magnetic state of the molecule are presented and discussed in section 4 .",
    "we consider a model magnetic tunnel junction which consists of two ferromagnetic leads separated by a nonmagnetic barrier , with a smm embedded in the barrier .",
    "electronic transport in the system occurs owing to tunneling processes between the leads .",
    "however , the tunneling electrons can interact with the smm _ via _ exchange interaction , leading to spin switching of the molecule . for simplicity",
    ", we will consider only collinear ( parallel and antiparallel ) configurations of the leads magnetic moments .",
    "in addition , magnetic moments of the leads are parallel to the magnetic easy axis of the smm , as shown schematically in fig .",

    "this also means that the charge state of smm is fixed and only projection of the molecule s spin on the quantization axis ( anisotropy axis ) can be changed due to the current .",
    "in addition , we restrict the following discussion to the case of weak coupling between the molecule and electrodes .",

    "the dip corresponds to the voltage range where the smm s spin reversal process takes place .",
    "it begins at the same voltage , @xmath81 mv , which corresponds to the energy gap between the smm s spin states @xmath0 and @xmath74 ( approximately @xmath82 k in the case considered ) . because the energy gaps between the higher spin states are smaller , this energy is the activation energy for the current induced switching . below the threshold voltage",
    "only direct tunneling ( described by the second term in eq.(4 ) ) and the non - spin - flip part of the first term in eq.(4 ) contribute to charge current .",
    "when the voltage activating spin reversal is reached , some of the tunneling electrons can flip their spins due to exchange interaction with the molecule , and this leads to spin reversal of the smm . as a result @xmath83 becomes reduced .",
    "this leads to partial suppression of the non - spin - flip contribution to current from the first term in eq.(4 ) .",
    "instead of this , a spin - flip contribution becomes nonzero .",
    "however , the latter contribution is small as it involves dos in the minority electron band of the right electrode , and can not compensate the loss of current due to the non - spin - flip tunneling ( which involves dos for majority electrons ) .",
    "this leads effectively to a dip in the current , which occurs in the voltage range where spin switching of the smm takes place .",
    "the dip disappears when spin of the smm is completely reversed .",
    "the broadening of the dip , in turn , stems from the fact that as @xmath84 , the transition times , @xmath85 , become longer and longer ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : transitiontimes ] ) ) , and the time required for complete smm s spin reversal becomes longer as well .",
    "this also makes the dip more pronounced .",
    "the situation is significantly different in the antiparallel configuration , figs  [ fig3](d)(f ) . instead of the dip in current",
    ", there is now a peak in the voltage range where the switching takes place .",
    "this is because now the role of spin minority and spin majority electron bands in the right lead is interchanged .",
    "additionally , the current flowing through the system tends to 0 when @xmath80 ( perfect spin valve effect ) , except for a small voltage range where the reversal of the smm s spin occurs .    in the parallel configuration and for fully polarized electrodes ( @xmath86 )",
    ", no reversal of the smm s spin occurs and a simple linear current - voltage characteristics is observed . on the other hand ,",
    "the linear characteristics disappears in the antiparallel configuration , and the current does not flow through the system except for the voltage range where the magnetic switching of the molecule takes place , fig .",
    "[ fig3](f ) .",
    "the probabilities @xmath31 depend on the velocity @xmath50 of the voltage increase , eq .",
    "( [ eq : masterequationh=0 ] ) . in fig.4",
    "we show @xmath87 and current @xmath71 in the parallel configuration and for several values of @xmath50 .",
    "the magnetic switching becomes clearly visible as a dip in the current for larger values of @xmath50 , fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) . at smaller values of @xmath50 ,",
    "the reversal is not resolved in the current , fig .",
    "[ fig4](d ) .",
    "in fact , the change in @xmath50 does not affect the time range within which the magnetic switching takes place , but it only modifies the dependence between the time and voltage scales . as a result ,",
    "the transition times @xmath85 become effectively longer within the time scale set by the rate at which the voltage is increased .",
    "therefore for the higher speeds one can observe the broadening of the dip .    in summary , we showed that spin of a smm can be reversed by a spin polarized current , and the switching process may be visible in current when voltage is increased in time .",
    "full reversal of the molecule s spin can be reached when at least one electrode is spin polarized .",
    "the numerical results presented above apply to the case with one electrode being fully spin polarized .",
    "however , the current - induced switching also takes place when spin polarization of this electrode is smaller .",
    "the switching time becomes then appropriately longer .",
    "moreover , for the parameters assumed in numerical calculations the switching for positive current was only from the state @xmath0 to @xmath47 . if the molecule would be initially in the state @xmath47 , switching to the state @xmath0 could be achieved by negative ( reversed ) current ."
