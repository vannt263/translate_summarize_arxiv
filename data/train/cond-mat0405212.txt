    "spin relaxation in semiconductors is an important physical phenomenon being actively studied recently in connection with various spintronics applications @xcite . in doped bulk samples and quantum wells ( qw ) of iii - v semiconductors at low temperatures spin",
    "relaxation is mostly due to the dp mechanism @xcite .",
    "this mechanism does not involve any inelastic processes , so that the exponential decay of the spin polarization is determined entirely by the spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) and elastic scattering of electrons on the impurities .",
    "however , in case of confined systems such as quantum dots ( qd ) with atomic - like eigenstates , the soi has been incorporated into the structure of the wave functions of the discrete energy levels . without inelastic interactions ,",
    "an initial wave packet with a given spin polarization will evolve in time as a coherent superposition of these discrete eigenstates .",
    "therefore , the corresponding expectation value of the spin polarization will oscillate in time without any decay . to obtain a polarization decay in the qd s",
    ", extra effects have to be introduced into the system , e.g. , the _",
    "inelastic _ interactions between electrons and phonons mediated by the spin - orbit @xcite and nuclear hyperfine effects @xcite .",
    "accordingly , a spin relaxation in qd s induced by these effects is a real dephasing process .",
    "unlike such an inelastic relaxation in qd s , the dp spin relaxation in unbounded systems seems to be a quite different phenomenon , because the scattering on impurities is elastic and there is no dephasing of the electron wave functions in the systems .",
    "however , the spin polarization does decay in time exponentially , as if it would be a true dephasing process . to explain this phenomenon ,",
    "let us consider an electron moving diffusively through an unbounded system with random elastic scatters .",
    "this electron is described by a wave packet represented by a superposition of _ continuum _ eigenstates . during a dp relaxation process",
    ", the spin expectation value expressed as a bilinear combination of these wave amplitudes will decay exponentially in time .",
    "this process can be easily understood from the semiclassical boltzmann or fokker - plank approach @xcite . indeed , keeping in mind that the soi has the form @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the vector , whose components are the three pauli matrices , and @xmath2 is the effective magnetic field , whose magnitude and direction depend on the electron momentum @xmath3 , one can envision spin relaxation as the spin random walk on the surface of the unit sphere , similar to that in fig .",
    "starting at the north pole , the spin precesses around @xmath4 until the momentum direction is changed by a scattering on an impurity .",
    "thereafter , the magnetic field changes its direction to @xmath5 and the spin continues its precession around this new direction . if the spin rotation angle between successive scattering events is small , the sequence of such rotations results in a diffusive spreading of the initial polarization .",
    "returning to qd s , a natural question emerges : what sort of spin evolution can be generated by the dp mechanism in a ballistic qd whose size is much larger than the electron wavelength at the fermi surface and where the mean spacing between energy levels is much less than @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the mean time between electron collisions with the boundary ?",
    "similar to the example in fig .",
    "1 , the spin evolution in this semiclassical regime can be studied by tracking the spin walk on the sphere , when particles move along the classical trajectories inside the qd s .",
    "intuitively , one would expect the spin evolution in this case to be similar to the spin random walk governed by the impurity scattering in unbounded samples .",
    "however , this expected analogy with the open system is wrong .",
    "indeed , in an unbounded system , the steps of the random walk are uncorrelated .",
    "this results in a diffusive decay of the spin polarization down to zero for any nonzero soi .",
    "but in case of qd s , the steps of the random walk on the sphere are correlated due to the confinement of electron trajectories within the dots . as we will show below , such correlations not only lead to a spin relaxation much longer than the dp relaxation in unbounded systems , but also to a non - zero final polarization value at long time for certain quantum dot geometries . here",
    ", we do not take into account the inelastic mechanisms @xcite which always drive the spin polarization to zero in long time .",
    "these mechanisms are assumed to be absent , because they become inefficient at low sufficiently temperatures .    in this article",
    "we carry out a semiclassical analysis of the dp relaxation in 2-dimensional ( 2d ) qd s of various geometries , including a circular dot , a triangular dot , a generalized sinai billiard , and a circular dot with diffusive scattering on the boundary .",
    "we focus on the case of the strong soi , such that the characteristic spin orbit length @xmath8 is not much larger than the dot size @xmath9 .",
    "such a regime can be realized in the inas based heterostructures for @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "we found that in the short time scale @xmath11 the spin relaxation dynamics in all geometries shares a common feature : after a fast initial drop during the time interval @xmath11 , the spin polarization continues to oscillate weakly around some value .",
    "for weak soi with @xmath12 , all residual values for different dot geometries are quite close to one up to the cutoff time of our numerical simulations ( @xmath13 ) . for stronger soi with @xmath14 ,",
    "the initial drop of the spin polarization is considerably larger compared to the weak soi regime .",
    "the spin evolution after that drop depends on the dot geometry . in the case of circular and triangular dots , which are examples of systems with regular classical dynamics ,",
    "the corresponding spin polarizations approach nonzero residual values .",
    "however , in the case of chaotic and random systems ( e.g. , sinai billiard and circular dot with rough boundaries , respectively ) , the spin polarizations slowly decrease to zero after that initial drop . but",
    "this decreasing is much longer than the dp relaxation in an unbounded system , in which the mean impurity scattering time is @xmath11 .",
    "for very strong soi with @xmath15 , the spin polarization after the initial drop reaches zero and later on oscillates with a large amplitude .",
    "these results clearly demonstrate that the spin evolution in qd s is qualitatively distinct from the dp spin relaxation in unbounded systems . in order to elucidate the physical origin of this phenomenon ,",
    "two investigations have been performed .",
    "first , the spin evolution along a single electron trajectory was studied in detail , which provided a clue for understanding the above - mentioned polarization behavior .",
    "second , the residual polarization obtained from the classical simulations for a circular quantum dot was compared with that derived from the exact solution of the schrdinger equation .",
    "a good agreement between the results from these two approaches has been found .",
    "however , for qd s with chaotic and random electron dynamics , the general quantum mechanical analysis revealed a contradiction to the long time spin evolution observed in our semiclassical simulations .",
    "the article is organized in the following way . in section",
    "ii the general expression of the polarization will be derived for the spin evolution via classical path integrals . in section iii the results of the numerical simulations in different quantum dots will be demonstrated . the quantum mechanical theory for the spin polarization in the circular quantum dot",
    "will be presented in section iv , with the calculation in detail shown in the appendix .",

    "1(c ) should be randomized by scattering of particles from dot boundaries , similar to randomization by impurity scattering in unbounded systems .",
    "however , this simple point of view is wrong , because there is an important difference between the impurity scattering and the boundary scattering .",
    "for convenience , let us define the scattering with a direction change smaller than @xmath156 as a forward scattering and that larger than @xmath156 as a backward scattering .",
    "if the particles are isotropically scattered by an impurity , half of them continue to move forward. however , if the particles are scattered by a smooth boundary , the particles with incident angles between @xmath186 to @xmath187 with respect to the boundary normal will be reflected backward. since statistically more particles hit the boundary within this range of angles , the backward scattering prevails in dq s .",
    "this property of particle scattering can also be extended to qd s with rough boundaries .",
    "further , according to fig .",
    "1 , a backward particle motion is mapped onto a backward spin walk . hence , if the spin moves away from the north pole in fig .",
    "1 , after a boundary scattering the spin is more likely bounced back towards the north pole .",
    "such a non - markovian statistics of the spin walks gives a clue for understanding the numerical results in subsection iii.2 .    in order to make this argument more clear it is instructive to study in detail the spin evolution along a single trajectory .",
    "as described in fig .",
    "1 , the spin motion on the unit sphere can be projected onto the @xmath136 plane .",
    "after a long time the spin path on the sphere will cover a region and produce a certain pattern on the @xmath136 plane . in the circular dot this pattern",
    "looks rather ordered . if the electron moves along a triangular periodic trajectory ( fig .",
    "7(a ) ) , the pattern is a rounded triangle ( fig .",
    "7(i ) ) . if the trajectories are hexahedral and star - like ( fig .",
    "7(b ) and ( c ) ) , the corresponding patterns are a rounded hexagon and a rounded star ( fig .",
    "7(j ) and ( k ) ) .",
    "if the trajectories are non - periodic , e.g. , fig .",
    "7(d ) , the pattern is a disc ( fig .",
    "a common feature of these patterns is that they have the same size , which is less than @xmath38 in the case of @xmath188 .",
    "these patterns are highly stable up to the observation time @xmath189 .",
    "it implies that the spin on the unit sphere can not move far away from the north pole , so that @xmath148 can not take negative values .",
    "our analysis of various trajectories with various initial conditions has confirmed this general feature of the spin evolution in the circular dot .",
    "hence , a non - zero @xmath185 in fig . 6 at infinitely long time is obviously expected .    in the triangular dot , two periodic and one non - periodic trajectories",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "7(f ) , ( g ) , and ( h ) .",
    "the corresponding spin patterns ( fig .",
    "7(n ) , ( o ) , and ( p ) ) are less symmetric and have less predictable sizes than those in the circular dot . for the trajectory in fig .",
    "7(g ) the pattern in fig .",
    "7(o ) touches the circular border .",
    "nevertheless , our investigation shows that the patterns of most other trajectories are quite stable up to the observation time 10@xmath190 and do not touch the boarder . on this reason",

    "( h ) a non - periodic trajectory in the triangular dot .",
    ", width=377 ]    in the circular dot with a rough boundary , the reflection angles are stochastic , as shown in fig .",
    "7(e ) . within the observation time @xmath180 the corresponding spin pattern on the @xmath136 plane has spread out to a much larger area ( fig .",
    "7(m ) ) than those in the smooth circular dot ( fig .",
    "7(i)-(l ) ) . furthermore ,",
    "the pattern in ( fig .",
    "7(m ) ) is still expanding .",
    "the corresponding spin state on the 3d sphere can penetrate into the lower hemisphere after @xmath180 .",
    "however , it can return back to the north sphere again .",
    "therefore , the @xmath20 component of this spin state oscillates between negative and positive values .",
    "when averaged over many trajectories , such oscillations sum up to a relaxation curve , similar to @xmath175 in fig . 5 .    in the sinai billiard",
    ", the @xmath136 pattern resembles that in the rough circular dot .",
    "consequently , the spin relaxation dynamics in both cases have similar characteristics ( curves @xmath175 and @xmath177 in fig . 5 ) .",
    "a general trend seen from fig .",
    "7 is that the confinement of the particle motion in qd s makes the spin to be also confined within the upper hemisphere , if @xmath167 is larger than the size of the qd s .",
    "for a smooth circular dot , this trend can be easily understood from the backward scattering effect described at the beginning of this subsection . since all trajectories in this case",
    "have a simple geometry , one can easily see that particles are more frequently scattered from the boundary in a backward direction .",
    "but although this argument holds for general bounded systems , it is less evident for other qd s besides the smooth circular dot . in general case ,",
    "the trend toward the spin confinement can be argued in a different way : as seen from fig .",
    "1 , the projected spin path on the @xmath136 plane in fig .",
    "1(b ) is more or less a rescaled curve of its particle trajectory in fig .",
    "but in reality the mapping from a trajectory to the corresponding spin path is not simply a rescaling , because the spin rotations on the sphere are non - commutative . for example",
    ", a closed particle trajectory is in general mapped onto an open spin path .",
    "however , if @xmath167 is large , the spin path is restricted to a small part of the sphere . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq21]-[eq22 ] ) , a closed particle trajectory produces an open spin path of the linear size @xmath191 , while the distance between the initial and the end points of the path is only @xmath192 .",
    "the mapping between the trajectories and the spin paths is then similar to a mapping between two euclidean spaces .",
    "therefore , with the accuracy @xmath193 , the spin paths are the rescaled particle trajectories and those paths are confined because the particle trajectories are confined .",
    "it should be noted that such a tendency for the spin confinement turns out to be strong even for not so large @xmath167 , as one can see from the spin dynamics shown in fig . 5 for @xmath184 .",
    "the above argument about the spin confinement does not take into account a long time evolution . even at large @xmath167 , small corrections due to non - commutativity of spin walks will accumulate in time . as a result",
    ", the spin can slowly drift toward the lower hemisphere . the expanding pattern in fig .",
    "7(m ) of the rough circular dot is an example of such a long time behavior .",
    "however , in contrast to that unstable pattern , the patterns from regular systems ( fig .",
    "7(i)-(p ) besides ( m ) ) remain stable in time .",
    "this difference between the single trajectories of random and regular systems is consistent with the spin relaxation curves shown in fig .",
    "such a distinction between regular and chaotic systems follows from fundamental properties of regular and chaotic systems .",
    "it can be understood from consideration of periodic orbits .",
    "after a particle runs along a periodic orbit @xmath67 and completes a period , its initial spin state @xmath41 will evolve to @xmath194 with @xmath195 $ ] , which represents a rotation around the axis @xmath34 through the angle @xmath196 .",
    "both @xmath34 and @xmath197 are determined entirely by the geometry of @xmath67 and by the value of @xmath167 . after the particle repeats @xmath198 periods , all spin positions @xmath199 , corresponding to the end points of all periods @xmath200 , are located on a closed circle .",
    "this circle can be obtained by rotating the north pole around @xmath34 , if the initial @xmath41 is related to the spin polarized in the north pole direction .",
    "the other points on the periodic orbit are mapped onto spin states around this circle .",
    "taking many periodic orbits into account , one obtains a set of different axes @xmath34 and consequently a set of circles passing through the north pole .",
    "hence , when averaged over all periodic orbits , spin spends more time in the upper hemisphere .",
    "this means that at least the family of the periodic orbits contributes to a nonzero residual polarization .",
    "how significant is this contribution to the whole residual value depends on the amount of the periodic orbits in a system , which is quite different in regular and chaotic systems . in a regular system",
    "the family of periodic orbits has a finitely positive measure and a bundle of adjacent nearly periodic orbits .",
    "these adjacent trajectories behave like periodic orbits if the time is not too large , because their linear deviation in time from the periodic orbits is small . on the contrary ,",
    "the periodic orbits in chaotic systems are of zero measure @xcite . furthermore ,",
    "their adjacent trajectories deviate from them exponentially fast .",
    "therefore , with increasing time , the weight of the periodic orbits and their adjacent trajectories becomes exponentially small in chaotic systems , while it is a nonzero value in regular systems .",
    "hence , as long as we consider only periodic orbits , the residual spin polarization has to be a positive number for regular systems and zero for chaotic systems .",
    "the individual trajectory study in a larger time scale carried out in this subsection helps us to understand some of the results in subsection iii .",
    "2 . however , although the existence of the nonzero residual polarization @xmath185 is apparent from figs . 3 - 6",
    ", one can not exclude a possibility that @xmath185 will decay to zero in a much larger time scale , since the numerical simulations in all these figures are truncated within a finite time .",
    "therefore , we can not definitely answer the question whether the spin polarization relaxes to zero at the infinitely long time , or to a nonzero residual value . for the smooth circular dot the latter alternative",
    "is corroborated by an analysis of the spin polarization from the exact solution of the schrdinger equation , as shown in the next section .",
    "due to the time reversal symmetry , the quantized energy levels @xmath30 of the hamiltonian @xmath201 in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) are , at least , two fold degenerate with the corresponding spinor eigenfunctions @xmath202 , where @xmath203 is the degeneracy index . in the basis of these states",

    "<S> we performed path integral simulations of spin evolution controlled by the rashba spin - orbit interaction in the semiclassical regime for chaotic and regular quantum dots . </S>",
    "<S> the spin polarization dynamics have been found to be strikingly different from the dyakonov - perel ( dp ) spin relaxation in bulk systems . </S>",
    "<S> also an important distinction have been found between long time spin evolutions in classically chaotic and regular systems . in the former case the spin polarization relaxes to zero within relaxation time much larger than the dp relaxation , while in the latter case it evolves to a time independent residual value . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum mechanical analysis of the spin evolution based on the exact solution of the schrdinger equation with rashba soi has confirmed the results of the classical simulations for the circular dot , which is expected to be valid in general regular systems . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the spin relaxation down to zero in chaotic dots contradicts to what have to be expected from quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> this signals on importance at long time of the mesoscopic echo effect missed in the semiclassical simulations . </S>"
