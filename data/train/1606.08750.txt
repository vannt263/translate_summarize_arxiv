    "quantum communication has demonstrated its usefulness for quantum cryptography far beyond quantum key distribution ( qkd ) .",
    "one domain is two - party cryptography ( 2pc ) , whose goal is to allow two parties alice and bob to solve joint tasks , while protecting an honest party against the actions of a malicious one .",
    "well - known examples of such tasks are oblivious transfer  @xcite , bit commitment , secure identification and private information retrieval .",
    "another interesting application is position - based cryptography ( pbc ) whose goal is to use the geographical location of an entity as its ( only ) credential . at the heart of these",
    "is the task of position - verification ( pv ) where a person wants to convince the ( honest ) verifiers that she is located at a particular location .",
    "quantum protocols for pv that make use of quantum communication to enhance the security have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "we will refer to such protocols as quantum position - verification ( pv ) .",
    "+ unfortunately , one can not achieve secure 2pc and pv without making assumptions on the power of the adversary , even using quantum communication  @xcite .",
    "this is in stark contrast to qkd where security against an all - powerful adversary ( obeying the laws of physics ) is attainable .",
    "the reason can be traced back to a key difference between the two scenarios : while in qkd alice and bob can cooperate to check on the actions of the eavesdropper , in 2pc they do not trust each other and need to fend for themselves .",
    "+ nevertheless , due to the practical importance of 2pc one is willing to make assumptions in order to achieve security .",
    "classically , one often relies on computational hardness assumptions such as the difficulty of factoring large numbers .",
    "however , as technology progresses the validity of such assumptions diminishes : it has been proven that factoring can be efficiently done on a quantum computer .",
    "most significantly , an adversary can retroactively break the security of a past execution of a cryptographic protocol  @xcite .",
    "it turns out , however , that security can also be achieved from certain physical assumptions  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of these comes from the fact that physical assumptions only need to hold during the course of the protocol .",
    "that is , even if the assumption is invalidated at a later point in time , security is not compromised .",
    "+ if we allow quantum communication , one possible physical assumption is the bounded quantum - storage model  @xcite , and more generally , the noisy - storage model  @xcite . here",
    ", the adversary is allowed to have an unlimited amount of classical storage , but his ability to store quantum information is limited .",
    "this is a relevant assumption since reliable storage of quantum information is challenging .",
    "significantly , however , security can always be achieved by sending more qubits than the storage device can handle .",
    "specifically , if we assume that the adversary can store at most @xmath0 qubits , then security can be achieved by sending @xmath1 qubits , where @xmath2  @xcite , which is essentially optimal since no protocol can be secure if @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding quantum protocols require only very simple quantum states and measurements  and no quantum storage  to be executed by the honest parties , and their feasibility has been demonstrated experimentally  @xcite .",
    "it is known that the noisy - storage model allows protocols for tasks such as oblivious transfer , bit commitment , as well as position - based cryptography  @xcite .",
    "+ in all these security proofs , however , one assumes perfect knowledge of the quantum devices used in the protocol . in other words , we know precisely what measurements the devices make , or what quantum states they prepare . here ,",
    "we present a general method to prove security for 2pc and pv , even if we only have limited knowledge of the quantum devices .",
    "chiefly , we assume that the quantum devices function as black boxes , into which we can only give a classical input , and record a classical output .",
    "the classical input indicates the choice of a measurement that we would wish to perform , although we are not guaranteed that the device actually performs this measurement .",
    "the classical output can be understood as the outcome of that measurement .",
    "the classical processing itself is assumed to be trusted .",
    "this idea of imagining black box devices is known as device - independent ( di ) quantum cryptography  @xcite .",
    "there is a large body of work in di qkd ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , but in contrast there is hardly any work in di 2pc .",
    "a protocol has been proposed by silman  @xcite for bit commitment which does not make physical assumptions , and hence only achieved a weak primitive .",
    "first steps towards di pv have also been made in  @xcite , and for one - sided di qkd in  @xcite .",
    "+ achieving di security for 2pc and pv presents us new with challenges which require a different approach than what is known from qkd  @xcite .    1 .   in qkd alice and",
    "bob trust each other , while eve is an eavesdropper trying to break the protocol .",
    "as in di qkd we will assume that the devices used in the protocol are made by the dishonest party .",
    "2 .   in qkd , after eve has prepared and given the devices  which she might be entangled with  to alice and bob , there is no more direct communication between them and eve . on the contrary in two party cryptography , the dishonest party , who prepared the devices ,",
    "will receive back _ quantum communication _ from these devices .",
    "this feature leads to different security analysis between di qkd and di 2pc , and also requires us to develop new proof techniques .",
    "since we assume that the quantum memory of bob is bounded he can not store the entire register @xmath7 received from alice . more specifically , according to the bounded storage model he must immediately input the register @xmath7 into an encoding map which outputs a quantum register @xmath8 ( whose dimension is bounded by @xmath9 ) and a classical register @xmath10 ( of arbitrary size ) . the joint state between alice and bob",
    "is then a qqc - state @xmath11 whose marginal remains i.i.d .",
    "once alice has measured her part of the system , bob is told the choice of her measurements represented by @xmath13 and is asked to guess the string of outcomes .",
    "we take the success probability given by   and expand the classical register @xmath10 to obtain @xmath14 where @xmath15 are the measurement operators on alice s side , and @xmath16 are @xmath9-dimensional measurement operators on bob s side acting on @xmath8 , which depend both on his classical memory @xmath17 and the basis string @xmath18 received from alice .",
    "the outer optimization is constrained to ensembles which yield the correct marginal on alice s side , i.e.  @xmath19 .",
    "the inner maximization represents @xmath20 independent maximizations each of which is over a povm @xmath21 .",
    "the rest of the proof will be concerned with upper bounding @xmath5 .",
    "inserting   into we get @xmath22 recall that @xmath23 represents the projection operator into the blocks indexed by @xmath24 .",
    "define @xmath25 to be the normalized projections of @xmath26 into these various blocks with @xmath27 .",
    "then @xmath28 and for convenience let us denote @xmath29 so that @xmath30 bounding each of the trace terms by its operator norm yields @xmath31 for each @xmath32 the corresponding operator norm can be bounded using lemma  [ lmm : normofsum ] as follows @xmath33 from which   becomes @xmath34      the goal of this section is to find a bound on @xmath4 which holds _ independenly of _ @xmath17 .",
    "the superscript @xmath17 of the operator @xmath35 reminds us that bob s measurement might depend on his classical information . here ,",
    "we derive a bound which only depends on the dimension of his quantum system i.e. independent of @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , we will from now omit the superscript @xmath17 which represented the classical information of bob .",
    "the following lemma is the key towards the main result .",
    "let us begin by simplifying @xmath40 using the definition of @xmath41 in step 2 and orthogonality relations of @xmath42 in step 1 .",
    "let @xmath43:\\theta'_k=\\theta_k\\}$ ] and @xmath44:\\theta'_k\\neq\\theta_k\\}$ ] be the indices where the measurement choices agree and differ respectively .",
    "then , @xmath45 where @xmath46 are the eigenvectors defined in step 1 .",
    "the notation @xmath46 should be read as the eigenvector representing the outcome @xmath47 of the measurement @xmath48 restricted to the block @xmath49 .",
    "the sum over @xmath50 can be split into a sum of variables with indices in @xmath51 which we will denote by @xmath52 and indices in @xmath53 denoted @xmath54 .",
    "the definition of @xmath51 implies that @xmath55 .",
    "let @xmath56 where the two strings @xmath57 and @xmath58 together form a bit string of length @xmath1 and give meaning to the notation @xmath59 ( same for @xmath60 ) .",
    "since the register labelled as @xmath61 consists of orthogonal projectors , the desired operator norm is achieved by a maximization over @xmath62 .",
    "that is @xmath63 in the following we derive an upper bound which does not depend on @xmath64 .",
    "since for @xmath65 we have @xmath66 , we use eq .   to evaluate the inner product @xmath67 where @xmath68 . therefore , @xmath69 where @xmath70    from @xmath71 and the definition @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a vector of angles , we simplify @xmath74 and get @xmath75 bounding the register labelled as @xmath76 by its operator norm does not decrease the norm as mentioned in lemma [ lmm : normofsum ] . hence we have @xmath77 bounding the outer operator norm with schatten two norm ( @xmath78 ) gives @xmath79 using submultiplicativity of the operator norm we have @xmath80 from the definition of @xmath81 in   it is easy to see that @xmath82 we can take it out of the sum @xmath83 the latter inequality holds because @xmath84 .",
    "using this bound in gives us , @xmath85^{1/4}\\\\    & = \\prod_{k \\in t}\\max\\{\\cos\\beta_{b_{k}},\\sin\\beta_{b_{k}}\\}\\left[\\sum_{x } \\|f^{\\theta'}_{\\tilde{x}x ' } \\|\\right]^{1/2 } \\\\    & \\leq \\sqrt{d } \\prod_{k \\in t}\\max\\{\\cos\\beta_{b_{k}},\\sin\\beta_{b_{k}}\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where in the last inequality we use the observation that for all @xmath86 @xmath87 since bob s quantum memory is of dimension at most @xmath9 .",
    "combining this bound with the trivial bound @xmath88 completes the proof .              in this section we first we bound bob s winning probability in terms of the absolute anti commutator @xmath101 , and then bound it by a quantity that alice can evaluate experimentally since it is a function of the bell violation she estimates during the testing phase .      in   we bounded the winning probability in terms of @xmath102 , which can be further bounded as follows @xmath103 where @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 is the vector @xmath107 , and @xmath108 where @xmath109 is a vector @xmath110 .",
    "define @xmath111 when we apply lemma  [ simp_nrm_bound ] we get the bound @xmath112 from , we observe that @xmath113 because the objective function to be maximized is independent of @xmath114 .",
    "the objective function in the optimization of   can be bounded as @xmath115 where the inner expression is independent of @xmath17 .",
    "this is the uniform bound we mentioned .",
    "performing the sum over @xmath17 first gives @xmath116 where @xmath117 for @xmath49 has been defined before  .",
    "hence we see explicitly that while the attack of bob may induce @xmath118 non - i.i.d .  for some @xmath17 , on average he can not influence alice s local i.i.d .",
    "state and therefore @xmath119 remains i.i.d .     swapping the order of summation over @xmath120 and @xmath121 and pulling the summation over @xmath120 inside the minimum ( which can only increase the value ) gives the upper bound @xmath122 the sum inside the minimum , @xmath123 is a product of sums because @xmath124 is a product ( see eq .  [ prod_p_b ] ) : @xmath125 now each sum in the product can be bounded because of the concavity of the square root we get @xmath126 hence we have @xmath127 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 is the vector @xmath107      [ lmm : main_tomo ] in the perfect guessing game where alice s devices behave i.i.d .",
    "and bob has a quantum memory of dimension @xmath9 , his winning probability is bounded by @xmath129,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath130 is the threshold defined as @xmath131^{-1 } \\right\\rfloor\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath132 with @xmath51 being the violation as defined in lemma [ bound_eps_+ ] .",
    "combine   with   and   and note that the maximizations over all strategies of bob drop out because we have bounded the winning probability of an arbitrary strategy .",
    "therefore , we obtain @xmath133 using lemma [ bound_eps_+ ] we have @xmath134 and then @xmath135 since the right - hand side depends only on the hamming weight of @xmath136 it is easy to perform the minimization explicitly , which yields @xmath137,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath130 is the threshold defined in the lemma ."
