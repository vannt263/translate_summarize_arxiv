    "observations of the kinematics and chemistry of stars in the halo of the milky way ( mw ) provide valuable clues to its assembly history , and that of other large galaxies in general . until relatively recently ,",
    "the mw s diffuse stellar halo has been thought to comprise only a single stellar population ",
    "stars with similar ages , chemical abundances , and kinematics . this long - standing idea has been challenged in the past decade by both observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) and ever more sophisticated simulations of the formation of large mw - like galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we briefly summarize our current understanding below .",
    "the evidence presented to date indicates that the diffuse galactic halo comprises at least two distinct stellar components  the inner - halo population ( ihp ) and the outer - halo population ( ohp ) , which can be distinguished based on their different spatial distributions , metallicity ( [ fe / h ] ) , and kinematics . as summarized by @xcite and @xcite , the inner - halo component dominates the population of halo stars found at distances up to 1015 kpc from the galactic center , while the outer - halo component dominates in the region beyond 1520 kpc .",
    "in addition , the inner halo exhibits a flatter density profile than the nearly spherical outer halo . the metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) of inner - halo stars peaks at [ fe / h ] = 1.6 , while the outer - halo stars exhibit a peak at [ fe / h ] = 2.2 .",
    "kinematically , the ihp shows either zero or slightly prograde rotation with respect to the galactic center , with stars on somewhat eccentric orbits , while the ohp exhibits a net retrograde rotation of about 80 km s@xmath4 , with stars on more circular orbits ( @xcite ) .",
    "the observed velocity ellipsoids of the populations also differ , in the sense that the ohp is kinematically `` hotter '' than the ihp @xcite .",
    "this view has been challenged by claims that systematic errors in adopted distances may artificially induce an apparent dual nature of the halo for samples whose kinematics are deduced from relatively local stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , @xcite refuted this argument , based on a number of lines of evidence .",
    "furthermore , @xcite , using a completely different modeling approach for distant k - type giants from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) , come to essentially the same conclusions as those arising from the interpretation of the local kinematics of halo stars .",
    "most recently , @xcite have used parallaxes and proper motions from the first gaia data release @xcite , in combination with metallicity estimates from data release 5 of the rave survey @xcite , to provide confirming evidence that the retrograde signature for ohp stars is highly unlikely to be an artifact of incorrect distance estimates in previous work .",
    "claims that the selection function of metal - poor stars in local samples may have led to an incorrect dual - halo inference ( echoed by , e.g. , @xcite ) have been empirically resolved by the results of @xcite .",
    "these authors estimated metallicities from coadded sdss @xmath5 photometry for stars with distances in the range 510 kpc from the sun , and derived an mdf with two peaks ( one at [ fe / h ] @xmath6 and the other at [ fe / h ] @xmath7 ) .",
    "they associated the more metal - rich component with the ihp and the more metal - poor component with the ohp .",
    "they further demonstrated that the two populations exhibit the expected kinematic signatures inferred from the analysis of @xcite . since no spectroscopic selection is made in the analysis by an et al . , the argument that the dual - halo interpretation could arise from such a source is rendered moot .      among the stars of the halo system ,",
    "the so - called carbon - enhanced metal - poor ( cemp ; @xcite ) stars have emerged as important tracers of the assembly and star - formation history of the galactic halo , as summarized briefly here .",
    "it has been recognized for over a decade that cemp stars can be divided into several subclasses , according to their level of neutron - capture element enhancement ",
    "cemp - no , cemp-@xmath3 , cemp-@xmath8 , and cemp-@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "cemp - no stars exhibit no overabundances of heavy neutron - capture elements , while cemp-@xmath3 objects show strong overabundances of elements associated with the @xmath3-process , such as ba .",
    "cemp-@xmath8 stars possess strong enhancements of @xmath8-process elements such as eu .",
    "carbon - enhanced stars with possible contributions from both the @xmath8-process and the @xmath3-process have been classified as cemp-@xmath9 stars .",
    "the ever - growing numbers of cemp stars with available high - resolution spectroscopic results have shown that the cemp-@xmath3 and cemp - no stars are the most populous subclasses , accounting for more than 95% of the samples of carbon - enhanced stars at low metallicity .",
    "numerous studies have also shown that the frequency of cemp stars in the halo system dramatically increases with decreasing metallicity ( e.g. , @xcite ) , as well as with distance from the galactic plane ( @xcite ) .",
    "it has also become clear that most cemp - no stars have [ fe / h ] @xmath10 2.5 , while cemp-@xmath3 stars are predominantly found among with [ fe / h ] @xmath11 2.5 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "long - term radial - velocity monitoring of cemp stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) has provided strong evidence for different binary fractions associated with the cemp-@xmath3 and cemp - no stars ",
    "@xmath1282% of cemp-@xmath3 ( including cemp-@xmath9 ) stars are binaries , while * only * @xmath1217% of cemp - no stars are binaries , consistent with the observed binary fraction of other metal - poor stars in the halo @xcite .",
    "it is thus clear that binarism is not required to account for the origin of the cemp - no stars ; their distinctive chemical signatures are very likely the result of the pollution of their natal clouds by first - generation stars .    from a kinematic analysis of cemp stars in sdss",
    ", @xcite reported a higher fraction of cemp stars associated with the ohp than with the ihp . from a similar analysis of the limited number of stars with available high - resolution spectroscopic classifications of cemp stars , @xcite demonstrated that the ohp exhibits a relatively higher fraction of cemp - no stars than found for cemp stars associated with the ihp , which slightly favored cemp-@xmath3 stars over cemp - no stars .",
    "the goal of this study is twofold .",
    "we first explore further evidence for the dichotomy of the diffuse halo system , based on the observed _ in situ _ spatial distribution of a large sample of @xmath12  105,700 main - sequence turnoff ( msto ) stars from sdss with measured carbon - to - iron ratios ( [ c / fe ] , which we refer to as `` carbonicity '' ) , located within 15 kpc of the sun .",
    "secondly , we search for the origin of the duality of the galactic halo by assessing the relative fractions of cemp - no and cemp-@xmath3 stars in the chemically separated ihp and ohp , making use of a recently suggested scheme based on absolute carbon abundances , @xmath2(c ) , developed by @xcite , to distinguish cemp - no stars from cemp-@xmath3 stars based on medium - resolution spectroscopy alone .",
    "note , however , that our msto sample covers substantially different ranges in metallicity and luminosity than the sample of @xcite .",
    "yoon et al.s sample is dominated by metal - poor giants with [ fe / h ] @xmath10 2.0 , while our msto stars primarily cover [ fe / h ] @xmath11 2.5 . as is addressed in section 4.4 ,",
    "these different samples suggest we must apply different reference points of the critical @xmath2(c )  value to separate cemp - no from cemp-@xmath3 stars than that ( @xmath2(c )  = 7.1 ) of @xcite .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows .",
    "section 2 summarizes the criteria used to select our program stars . in section 3 ,",
    "we validate our measurement of [ c / fe ] by comparison with available high - resolution spectroscopy and noise - added synthetic spectra . in section 4",
    ", we obtain the spatial distribution of [ c / fe ]  for the stars in our sample , and identify four regions that we associate with different stellar populations in the mw .",
    "the mdfs and the carbonicity distribution functions ( cdfs ) for each region are considered .",
    "we also assess the fractions of the cemp - no stars and cemp-@xmath3 stars for these regions .",
    "section 5 presents a plausible origin of the dichotomy of the galactic halo , based on the data in hand .",
    "a summary of our results , and prospects for future work , is presented in section 6 .",
    "the sample used in this study primarily comprises medium - resolution ( @xmath13 2000 ) spectra for stars observed during the course of the legacy sdss program and the sloan extension for galactic understanding and exploration ( segue-1 ; @xcite ) , as well as segue-2 ( c. rockosi et al .",
    "2017 , in preparation ) .",
    "we also included spectra of spectrophotometric standard stars obtained during the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ; @xcite ) , which was one of the four projects executed during the third phase of the sdss @xcite .",
    "we selected stellar spectra from legacy sdss , segue-1 , segue-2 , and boss , based on @xmath14 magnitude , @xmath15 color , surface gravity ( @xmath16 ) , and effective temperature ( @xmath17 ) that satisfied the following conditions : 15.0 @xmath18 , 0.22 @xmath19 , 3.5 @xmath20 @xmath16  @xmath20 4.8 , and 5600 k @xmath21 @xmath17@xmath22  k. the magnitude and color cuts are similar to those for the selection of spectrophotometric standard stars in boss , which correspond to the msto objects of an old stellar population ; the gravity and temperature ranges also restrict our sample to msto stars .",
    "the green boxes in figure  [ fig : sample ] indicate the ranges of magnitude , color , surface gravity , and temperature used to select our program stars .",
    "estimates of the stellar atmospheric parameters ( @xmath17 , @xmath16 , and [ fe / h ] ) for our program stars were obtained through application of the segue stellar parameter pipeline ( sspp ; @xcite ) .",
    "the carbonicity , [ c / fe ] , was estimated following the procedures of @xcite .",
    "typical errors in the stellar parameters are @xmath23  k for @xmath17 , @xmath24 dex for @xmath16 , and @xmath25 dex for [ fe / h ] , respectively , while the error in the estimated [ c / fe ] is better than 0.35 dex in the temperature range 4400  k @xmath20 @xmath17  @xmath20 6700  k for spectra with signal - to - noise ratios s / n @xmath26 @xmath4 @xcite , increasing to @xmath27 dex at s / n = 10 @xmath4 .",
    "more recent tests of errors in the sspp estimates of carbonicity suggest that these estimates are conservative , and that the actual errors in their determination are likely to be @xmath120.250.35 dex over these ranges in s / n .",
    "we removed stars from our sample that were drawn from spectroscopic plug - plates taken in the direction of open cluster and globular cluster fields , in order to minimize contamination .",
    "since there are many stars that were observed more than once , we chose to include only the spectrum with the highest s / n for multiply observed stars .",
    "we visually inspected all the spectra of stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath28 1.0 used in our program to exclude cool white dwarfs and objects with defects in their spectra , which could lead to spurious estimates of atmospheric parameters . for a clear detection of the ch @xmath29-band around 4300 , which ensures a good measurement of [ c / fe ] , we selected spectra for stars with equivalent widths of the carbon feature in the region 42904318 larger than 0.6 , because we have found that spurious estimates of [ c / fe ] become significant below this value .",
    "we followed the methodology of @xcite to determine the distance to each star ; the typical distance uncertainty is of the order of 15 - 20% .",
    "this was then used to compute the distance from the galactic mid - plane , @xmath30 , and the distance from the galactic center projected onto the plane , @xmath31 , assuming the sun is located at 8.5 kpc from the galactic center .",
    "our final sample comprises stars with spectra having s / n @xmath32 12 @xmath4 ( see the next section for justification of this cut ) and valid estimates of @xmath17 , @xmath16 , [ fe / h ] , [ c / fe ] , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    "the total number of stars in the sample is @xmath33 .",
    "the boss calibration stars in our sample are extremely useful probes of the galactic halo , because they reach two magnitudes fainter than the legacy sdss and segue calibration stars ( see figure  [ fig : sample ] ) .",
    "although inclusion of redder stars would add a large number of more distant giants , one clear advantage of our msto sample is that stars in this stage of evolution do not suffer from dilution of their surface carbon abundances by material that has undergone cn cycling ( due to extra mixing occurring along the red - giant branch ) .",
    "we note , however , that this choice also introduces some difficulty for the detection of molecular carbon features for a subset of the msto stars in our sample , in particular for warmer and lower - metallicity stars .",
    "this follows because the strength of the ch @xmath29-band around 4300 , which is used by the sspp to estimate [ c / fe ] , decreases at higher temperatures and lower metallicity . as a result",
    ", some bona - fide cemp stars may escape detection , and will be misclassified as carbon - normal stars .",
    "this problem occurs even for high - resolution spectroscopic analyses  examples of such cases are the well - known warm , metal - poor subdwarfs g  64 - 12 ( [ fe / h ] = 3.29 ) and g  64 - 37 ( [ fe / h ] = 3.11 ) , whose status as cemp - no stars was only recently demonstrated by @xcite , based on extremely high s / n ( @xmath34 ) , high - resolution ( @xmath35 ) spectra .    in order to check the reliability of the sspp estimate of carbonicity",
    ", we first compared our [ c / fe ] values with the results from high - resolution spectroscopy for the small sample of stars in common from table 1 of @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : ccheck ] shows the results of this exercise .",
    "the top panel of this figure is a residual plot of the sspp - estimated [ c / fe ] compared to the literature values , where ` sp ' indicates the estimation from the sspp , and ` hr ' indicates the literature value from @xcite .",
    "we identified a positive offset between the sspp and literature estimates of [ c / fe ] of @xmath360.16 dex , and have reduced the plotted sspp carbonicity estimates by this amount .",
    "the bottom panel is a similar residual plot , but for @xmath2(c ) .",
    "the offset of @xmath360.16 dex in [ c / fe ] is also corrected in this panel .",
    "the top panel of figure [ fig : tcheck ] shows the distribution of the carbonicity residuals as a function of @xmath17  ( corrected for the @xmath360.16 dex offset as before ) .",
    "the bottom panel is the distribution of metallicity residuals as a function of the hr literature estimates of [ fe / h ] ; we found no significant metallicity offset of the sspp estimates from the high - resolution values . in summary",
    ", figures  [ fig : ccheck ] and [ fig : tcheck ] do not exhibit any significant trends of the sspp [ c / fe ] and [ fe / h ] estimates against the high - resolution estimates , and show good agreement with very small scatter , even in the range of [ fe / h ] @xmath10 2.5 .",
    "most of the comparison stars fall in the same warm , low - metallicity regime as for our sample stars ; it appears that we are able to obtain reliable estimates of [ c / fe ] using the sspp for these stars .",
    "the difficulty of detecting molecular carbon features for warmer and lower - metallicity stars in our sample becomes worse for low - s / n spectra , and may also result in underestimates of [ c / fe ] , even when the carbon features are detected .",
    "below we describe a set of tests we have carried out to quantify these effects .",
    "we first injected noise into the grid of synthetic spectra that was used to estimate [ c / fe ] .",
    "we then chose an sdss / segue spectrum that has similar values of @xmath17  and [ fe / h ]  to a model spectrum to which we want to add noise , and created a noise vector by dividing the flux of the model spectrum by the s / n values of the selected sdss / segue spectrum as a function of wavelength . following this step , we injected the generated noise into the synthetic spectra and obtained noise - added synthetic spectra with s /",
    "n = 10.0 , 12.5 , 15.0 , 20.0 , 25.0 , 30.0 , 35.0 , 40.0 , and 50.0 @xmath4 , and simulated 25 different noise - added synthetic spectra at each s / n value . finally , we processed the noise - added spectra through the sspp to determine estimates of [ c / fe ] , holding the @xmath17and @xmath16  values that represent the synthetic spectra fixed , and letting only [ fe / h ]  and [ c / fe ]  vary ( as is done for the usual operation of the sspp on program stars ) to minimize the @xmath37 values .",
    "we proceeded by grouping the noise - added synthetic spectra into two regions of @xmath17  ( 55006000  k and 62506750  k ) , three regions of [ fe / h ]  ( 1.0 to 0.5 , 2.0 to 1.5 , and 3.0 to 2.5 ) , and three regions of [ c / fe ]  ( @xmath360.00 to @xmath360.50 , @xmath360.75 to @xmath361.25 , @xmath361.50 to @xmath362.00 ) .",
    "we only considered one gravity range , 3.5 @xmath20 @xmath16  @xmath20 4.5 .",
    "these ranges of temperature , gravity , and metallicity well represent the parameter space of our msto sample . for each s / n value",
    ", we then obtained the median and standard deviation of the differences in [ c / fe ]  estimates between the sspp - estimated values and the model values for each group of spectra .",
    "we adopted a median rather than a mean value to prevent the residuals from being dominated by a few spurious determinations of [ c / fe ] , especially for low - s / n spectra .",
    "figure  [ fig : snr ] shows how the residuals in [ c / fe ] change with s / n .",
    "the ranges of temperature , metallicity , and carbonicity considered are listed at the top of each panel ; the symbols have the same colors as the metallicity ranges .",
    "the label ` sspp ' indicates the sspp values , whereas ` syn ' denotes the model values . in the figure",
    ", @xmath38s / n@xmath39 is an average s / n per angstrom .",
    "the error bar represents the standard deviation .",
    "figure  [ fig : snr ] indicates that our technique for determining [ c / fe ] reproduces it reasonably well , because the median difference between the sspp and the model is mostly less than 0.3 dex , commensurate with the uncertainty of the sspp [ c / fe ] estimate , for [ fe / h ] @xmath32 2.0 and s / n @xmath40 @xmath4 .",
    "larger deviations exist for stars with 3.0 @xmath20 [ fe / h ] @xmath20 2.5 and/or s / n @xmath41 . based on inspection of figure  [ fig : snr ]",
    ", we adjusted our estimate of [ c / fe ] by 0.1 or 0.2 dex for stars in the following ranges :    * 5600 @xmath20 @xmath17  @xmath10 6100 k , 2.5 @xmath10 [ fe / h ] @xmath20 2.0 , 12.0 @xmath20 s / n @xmath20 20.0 ( @xmath360.1 dex correction ) * 5600 @xmath20 @xmath17  @xmath10 6100 k , [ fe / h ] @xmath20 2.5 , s / n @xmath32 12.0 ( @xmath360.2 dex correction ) * 6100 @xmath20 @xmath17  @xmath20 6700 k , 2.0 @xmath20 [ fe / h ] @xmath20 1.5 , 12.0 @xmath20 s / n @xmath20 20.0 ( @xmath360.1 dex correction ) * 6100 @xmath20 @xmath17  @xmath10 6700 k , [ fe / h ] @xmath20 2.5 , s / n @xmath32 12.0 ( @xmath360.2 dex correction )    the numbers of stars affected are is 468 , 54 , 6676 , and 1461 , respectively . stars for which the molecular carbon features are not detected fall out of our sample and are no longer considered .",
    "one unexpected trend , seen in the first and second panels of the right - hand column of plots ( the warmest stars ) , is that the residuals for the lowest - metallicity stars suddenly decrease at s / n = 10.0 , in contrast to the behavior at higher s / n .",
    "this may be caused by a very broad and poorly constrained distribution of @xmath37 values at low s / n , high @xmath17 , and low [ fe / h ] , which results in an unreliable estimate of [ c / fe ] .",
    "for this reason we decided to cut our sample by requiring s / n @xmath32 12.0 . using a much larger grid of noise - added synthetic spectra , we are currently developing a procedure to derive a smooth correction function of sspp - derived [ c / fe ] for msto objects that could suffer from this problem , as functions of s / n , @xmath17 , [ fe / h ] , and [ c / fe ]  of the observed medium - resolution spectra .",
    "having prepared our msto sample as described above , and carried out a number of small corrections to our estimates of [ c / fe ] , we now consider the distribution of carbonicity ( sec .",
    "4.1 ) and metallicity ( sec . 4.2 ) .",
    "we then consider the apparent dichotomy of the halo system of the galaxy in metallicity ( sec .",
    "4.3 ) and in absolute carbon abundance , @xmath2(c ) ( sec .",
    "4.4 ) , over distances extending to 15 kpc from the sun .",
    "figure [ fig : cmap ] is a map of [ c / fe ]  for our msto sample in the plane of @xmath42  vs. @xmath31 . from inspection , it is clear that , at a given @xmath31 , the median [ c / fe ]  ( indicated by the contour lines ) gradually increases with increasing @xmath42 .",
    "the dashed circles in the figure are centered at @xmath43 9 kpc , the inner circle having a radius of 8.5 kpc , while the outer circle has a radius of 11.5 kpc .",
    "the inner circle falls close to the contour of [ c / fe ] = @xmath360.4 , whereas the outer circle closely follows the contour with [ c / fe ] = @xmath360.6 .",
    "making use of these contour lines as fiducials to guide our choice , we divide the map into four primary regions , and associate stars in each region with an expected dominant stellar population as follows :    * thick - disk region ( tdr )  the region with @xmath42  @xmath44 kpc shown in the figure .",
    "stars in this region are likely to be dominated by the thick - disk population ( tdp ) .",
    "* inner - halo region ( ihr )  the region corresponding to @xmath42  @xmath11 3 kpc and the inner dashed circle , which closely follows the [ c / fe ] = @xmath360.4 contour .",

    "* outer - halo region ( ohr )  the region beyond the outer dashed circle .",
    "stars in this region are expected to be dominated by the ohp .",
    "* transition region ( trr )  defined as the region between the two dashed circles .",
    "stars in this region are expected to be contributed by both the ihp and ohp ; for convenience we refer to these stars as a transition population ( trp ) , although it is understood that this represents an overlap of the ihp and ohp , not a separate population .",
    "we adopt the distance cut at @xmath42  @xmath20 3 kpc for the tdr by considering the scale heights of the thick disk and the metal - weak thick disk determined by @xcite .",
    "the boundaries for the ihr and ohr are determined by inspection of the carbonicity contours .",
    "we emphasize that our scheme to separate the stellar populations for the ihr and ohr ( as well as the trr ) is @xmath45 based on metallicity or kinematics , but relies solely on the level of [ c / fe ] at a given location .",
    "these regions are shown with white labels in figure  [ fig : cmap ] .",
    "figure [ fig : fmap ] is a metallicity map of our program sample over the same range of @xmath42  and @xmath31 as shown in figure [ fig : cmap ] .",
    "the regions identified in the carbonicity map are also labeled in this figure . from inspection ,",
    "each of the carbonicity regions exhibits a different level of metallicity  the ihr with [ fe / h ] @xmath12 1.5 , and the ohr with [ fe / h ] @xmath46 2.0 , similar to the proposed divisions of the ihp and ohp obtained in the analysis of @xcite on the basis of local kinematics ( stars within 4 kpc of the sun ) .",
    "note that the monoceros stream @xcite is clearly identifiable in the figure , and appears as the yellow - orange region with [ fe / h ] @xmath12 1.0 at @xmath47 kpc and @xmath42  @xmath48 kpc .",
    "we now investigate the metallicity distributions of each region defined in figure [ fig : cmap ] , to test whether we can identify distinct mdfs associated with the inner- and outer - halo populations .",

    "note that , when selecting the stars in each region , in addition to the criteria described in figure  [ fig : cmap ] , we applied @xmath42  @xmath11 3 kpc for the ihr , @xmath42  @xmath11 5 kpc for the trr , and @xmath42@xmath11 7 kpc for the ohr , in order to minimize cross - contamination from stars in the different regions .    inspection of the left column of panels in the figure clearly shows that the peak of the mdfs shifts to lower metallicity as we move from the ihr to the ohr ( from the second to the fourth plot ) .",
    "the mdf of the tdr shows two peaks  one arising from the canonical thick - disk population at [ fe / h ] @xmath12 0.6 , the other from the ihp at [ fe / h ] @xmath12 1.5 .",
    "the mdf for stars in the ihr exhibits a well - defined distribution with a peak at [ fe / h ] = 1.5 , associated with the ihp .",
    "the mdf of the trr appears to have a broad distribution , presumably due to the presence of overlapping contributions from the ihp and the ohp .",
    "finally , the stars in the ohr exhibit a well - defined peak at [ fe / h ] @xmath12 2.2 . associated with the ohp .    our peak value of [ fe / h ] = 1.5 for stars in the ihr , which we argue",
    "are likely associated with the ihp , is similar to that obtained by @xcite for the ihp , [ fe / h ] = 1.4 , while the peak we obtain for the ohr , [ fe / h ] = 2.2 , is somewhat lower than the [ fe / h ] = 1.9 for the ohp found by @xcite . note that an et al .",
    "explored an _ in situ _ sample of main - sequence stars covering a similar distance range to our msto sample , but truncated beyond 10 kpc from the sun .",
    "the difference in the metallicity peaks of the ohp between the two analyses likely arises due to the increasing lack of sensitivity of photometric metallicity techniques based on broadband @xmath5 for stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath49 .",
    "even though the divisions of the regions we consider were made on the basis of carbonicity , the peaks of the mdfs for the dominant populations we associate with each region also agree very well with those inferred to exist from an analysis of local kinematics by @xcite .",
    "reaching such similar conclusions from three very different approaches provides confidence in the reality of the dual - halo nature of the mw .",
    "the panels in the left column in figure [ fig : mdf ] also demonstrate the clear advantage gained by using chemical - abundance ratios to distinguish one component from another . in these panels ,",
    "the green , blue , and red curves represent individual mdfs evaluated from a simple two - component gaussian mixture - model analysis .",
    "the blue distribution represents the ihp , while the red distribution is associated with the ohp .",
    "note that the stars assigned to the ihp by this approach have almost no contribution from stars of the ohp , whereas the objects classified as the ohp have only a negligible contribution from the ihp .",
    "these results indicate that chemical - abundance ratios provide a more powerful discriminator for the identification of stellar populations than the kinematic and orbital information ( including angular momentum and integrals of motion ) alone , which can result in substantial overlap of the populations .    the right column of panels in figure [ fig : mdf ] shows the cdf for each region .",
    "the number of stars in each panel is the same as in the corresponding panel on the left .",
    "inspection of these panels indicates that the fraction of stars with carbon enhancements relative to iron clearly varies from region to region .",
    "the fiducial dashed lines indicate the solar [ c / fe ] and the level of carbon enhancement conventionally used to identify cemp stars , [ c / fe ] @xmath50 .",
    "the fraction of cemp stars increases as one proceeds from the tdr to the ihr , trr , and ohr .",
    "this provides suggestive , but not yet definitive , evidence that different progenitors may be responsible for the majority production of carbon in the underlying stellar populations we associate with these regions .",
    "the diversity of the heavy - element abundance patterns found among cemp stars ( cemp - no , cemp-@xmath3 , cemp-@xmath8 , and cemp-@xmath9 ) already indicates that there is likely to be more than one source of carbon production at low metallicity , and perhaps even within the subclasses themselves ( see the discussion by @xcite ) .",
    "this , along with the contrast seen in the carbonicity map of the halo - system stars , suggests that different subclasses of cemp stars might be associated with different dominant nucleosynthesis pathways within their associated stellar populations .",
    "@xcite tested this idea using the limited number of cemp stars with high - resolution measurements of [ c / fe ] and [ ba / fe ] then available to calculate the relative fractions of cemp-@xmath3 and cemp - no stars associated with the ihp and ohp , separated on the basis of their integrals of motion .",
    "these authors demonstrated that the cemp stars associated with the ohp exhibit a higher fraction ( by about a factor of two ) of cemp - no stars than cemp-@xmath3 stars , while the ihp only slightly favors cemp-@xmath3 stars over cemp - no stars . a much larger sample of cemp stars is required , however , for confirmation of this behavior .    according to the conventional criterion used to distinguish cemp-@xmath3 stars from cemp - no stars , a high - resolution spectroscopic measurement of ( at least ) the [ ba / fe ] ratio is required .",
    "however , @xcite have recently developed a new method for separation of these subclasses of cemp stars based solely on the absolute carbon abundance , @xmath2(c ) , which can be obtained from medium - resolution spectroscopy such as that available for our sdss program stars . according to the classification exercise carried out by @xcite , cemp-@xmath3 stars have @xmath2(c )  @xmath11 7.1 , while the cemp - no stars have @xmath2(c )",
    "@xmath28 7.1 .",
    "we consider this approach to test whether or not the relative fractions of cemp - no and cemp-@xmath3 stars in the ohr differ significantly from those in the ihr , and by inference , between the ohp and the ihp .",
    "figure  [ fig : ac ] shows the distribution of @xmath2(c )  for each region of the carbonicity map in figure [ fig : cmap ] . to compare the two different subclasses of cemp stars ,",
    "we include only the stars with [ c / fe ]  @xmath51 and [ fe / h ]  @xmath20 1.0 in the figure .",
    "the blue and red curves are gaussians obtained from a simple two - sample mixture model for each region .",
    "the blue dashed vertical line represents the mean @xmath2(c ) of the stars that yoon et al .",
    "classify as cemp-@xmath3 , while the red dashed vertical line is the reference line to distinguish between the cemp - no and cemp-@xmath3 stars used by @xcite . from inspection of this figure ,",
    "the ihr exhibits a very broad distribution with likely separable peaks at @xmath2(c )  @xmath12 7.3 and @xmath2(c ) @xmath12 7.9 , respectively , while the ohr exhibits a strong peak at @xmath2(c )  = 7.1 and only a very small peak at @xmath2(c ) @xmath12 7.9 .",
    "inspection of the @xmath2(c ) distribution in the trr shows the expected shift between these two different behaviors , because the relative proportion of the low-@xmath2(c )  stars increases as one moves from the ihr to the ohr .",
    "quantitatively , if we separate stars in each region at @xmath2(c )  = 7.1 , the dividing line between cemp - no and cemp-@xmath3 according to @xcite , we obtain fractions of 84% and 16% for high-@xmath2(c)and low-@xmath2(c )  stars in the ihr , 77% and 23% in the trr , and 63% and 37% in the ohr , respectively . on the other hand , using the fractions of high- and low-@xmath2(c )  stars identified by the gaussian mixture model for each region , we obtain 42% for the high-@xmath2(c )  stars ( blue curve in the figure ) and 58% for the low-@xmath2(c )  stars ( red curve in the figure ) in the ihr , 24% and 76% in the trr , and 13% and 87% in the ohp , respectively .",
    "these results clearly indicate an increasing trend in the relative fractions of the low-@xmath2(c )  stars with respect to the high-@xmath2(c)stars from the ihr to the ohr .",
    "the increasing fraction of low-@xmath2(c )  stars provides strong suggestive evidence that different progenitors contributed to stellar populations we associate with these regions .    unlike the mean value of @xmath2(c )",
    "= 6.3 for the low-@xmath2(c )  stars found by @xcite , represented by cemp - no stars ( classifications based on high - resolution spectroscopy for a sample that included numerous giants ) , our distribution of low-@xmath2(c )  stars exhibits a peak around @xmath2(c )  = 7.1 .",
    "this is @xmath45 primarily because of our inability to detect low-@xmath2(c )  cemp - no stars in our sample of metal - poor msto stars , @xmath52 because the stars in our program sample cover substantially different ranges of metallicity and luminosity . as shown in figure 1 of @xcite , which we refer to as the yoon ",
    "beers diagram , their cemp - no stars are dominated by objects with [ fe / h ] @xmath10 3.0 . on the other hand ,",
    "as seen from figure  [ fig : mdf ] , our sample of msto stars is dominated by objects with [ fe / h ] @xmath11 2.5 .",
    "beers diagram of @xcite reveals that most of the cemp - no stars in this metallicity range have @xmath2(c )  @xmath11 6.3 . if we consider only the cemp - no stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath11 3.0 from their sample , we obtain a peak for the low-@xmath2(c )  stars at @xmath2(c )  @xmath12 6.6 .",
    "moreover , excluding the giants with @xmath16  @xmath53 in the sample of @xcite , which are not present in our sample , we obtain a low-@xmath2(c )  peak value of @xmath2(c )  = 6.8 .",
    "these two values are much closer to our determinations .",
    "the high-@xmath2(c)stars from yoon et al . , which include more objects with [ fe / h ]",
    "@xmath11 2.5 , have a mean value of @xmath2(c )  = 7.9 , in excellent agreement with our peak value of @xmath2(c )  @xmath12 7.9 , shown by the blue curve in figure  [ fig : ac ] .",
    "this exercise raises two important points .",
    "first , the appropriate @xmath2(c ) division line between cemp-@xmath3 and cemp - no stars may depend , at least weakly , on stellar temperature and luminosity class , and secondly , the the peak value of @xmath2(c )  for cemp - no stars varies over the metallicity range considered in a given sample . a value of @xmath2(c )",
    "@xmath54 would be a more suitable location to divide the low- and high- @xmath2(c )  stars for our msto sample , rather than the level of @xmath2(c ) = 7.1 for the sample of the yoon et al . , which included substantial numbers of cooler stars and more metal - poor stars .",
    "as discussed above , when the halo populations of the mw are separated based on their carbonicity , [ c / fe ] , we find that the component associated with the ihp exhibits a peak metallicity at [ fe / h ] @xmath12 1.5 , while the peak metallicity associated with the ohp is [ fe / h ] @xmath12 2.2 . these results are completely consistent with previous studies by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we have also quantitatively assessed the fraction of cemp - no and cemp-@xmath3 stars in the ohp and ihp , classified on the basis of their observed @xmath2(c ) , and found that the stars associated with the ohp exhibit a higher proportion of cemp - no stars , compared to cemp-@xmath3 stars , than found for stars associated with the ihp .",
    "these results suggest that the progenitors of these two classes of cemp stars contributed to the outer- and inner - halo populations in different proportions , a valuable clue to unraveling the apparently different assembly histories of the ohp and ihp .",
    "current simulations of the hierarchical assembly of mw - like galaxies within the @xmath55-cdm paradigm ( e.g. , @xcite ) show that the inner halo formed through mergers of a few relatively massive gas - rich mini - halos , which underwent dissipative ( angular - momentum - conserving ) collapse , in contrast with the stars of the outer halo , which formed in numerous lower - mass mini - halos that were accreted into the galactic halo through chaotic , dissipationless mergers .",
    "in such a scenario , star formation in the relatively massive gas - rich subfragments that led to the inner halo would be expected to be very efficient , and chemical enrichment could proceed rapidly .",
    "this would lead to the formation of moderately metal - poor stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath12 1.5 , including numerous intermediate - mass ( @xmath12 14 @xmath56 ) asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars , a subset of which formed as members of the binaries that produced ( via mass transfer of their nucleosynthesis products ) the cemp-@xmath3 stars observed today .",
    "cemp - no stars would have formed from the nucleosynthesis products of more massive progenitors during the first , or at least early , bursts of star formation in their parent mini - halos ; some might also be expected to be present among early - generation stars in the mini - halos associated with the ihp . in this manner , one might understand the preferential production of cemp - no stars at low metallicity , relative to cemp-@xmath3 stars , as reported by previous studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , as well as our present work .    the cemp - no and cemp-@xmath3 stars are thought to originate from different classes of astrophysical progenitors : ( 1 ) cemp - no stars from the so - called `` faint supernovae '' or `` mixing - and - fallback '' models with masses of @xmath122060 @xmath56  ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or `` spinstar '' models with masses @xmath11 60100 @xmath56  ( @xcite ) ; ( 2 ) cemp-@xmath3 stars from binary mass transfer from intermediate - mass ( 14 @xmath56 ) agb stars , which have now evolved to become faint white dwarfs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the results from recently completed long - term radial - velocity monitoring programs ( @xcite ) provide strong support for these assertions , based on the very different binary fractions of these two subclasses of cemp stars .",
    "since the proposed mass ranges for the progenitors of cemp - no and cemp-@xmath3  differ substantially , the relative fractions of cemp - no and cemp-@xmath3stars between the ihp and ohp can potentially provide strong constraints on the initial mass functions ( imfs ) in the environments that were dominantly responsible for the formation of the two populations , as suggested by a number of previous authors ( e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the best surviving candidates for the environments in which early star formation took place ( perhaps corresponding to the lower - mass mini - halos that contributed stars to the ohp ) are the ultra - faint dwarf ( ufd ) galaxies around the mw discovered during the sdss ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is presumably no coincidence that our substantially higher fraction of cemp - no stars associated with the ohp , compared with the cemp-@xmath3 stars of the ohp , is consistent with the relative dominance of cemp - no stars among the ufds associated with the mw ( e.g. , @xcite ) . indeed",
    ", the large fraction of cemp - no stars we associate with the ohp suggests that systems similar to disrupted ufd galaxies may have contributed significantly to the formation of the ohp of the mw .",
    "we have used a sample of over 100,000 msto stars from the sdss to investigate the @xmath57 spatial distribution of carbonicity ( [ c / fe ] ) of the galactic halo system , and demonstrated that it exhibits different levels of carbonicity as the distance from the galactic plane increases . dividing our sample into four regions in the plane of @xmath42  vs. @xmath31 , based on their carbon enhancement and location ,",
    "we construct the mdf for each region .",
    "the mdfs of the halo regions are interpreted in terms of the differing contributions from the inner- and outer - halo populations .",
    "the ihp exhibits a peak at [ fe / h ] @xmath12 1.5 , while a peak at [ fe / h ] @xmath12 2.2 is associated with the ohp , consistent with a number of previous studies .",
    "this result provides further evidence for the duality of the galactic halo , based on an entirely different approach from the ones used before .",
    "we have quantitatively assessed the relative fractions of cemp - no and cemp-@xmath3 stars ( classified on the basis of their derived absolute carbon abundances , @xmath2(c ) ) in the ihr and ohr ( which we associate with dominant contributions from the ihp and ohp ) , and find that that the cemp stars in the ohr exhibit a significantly higher proportion of cemp - no stars relative to cemp-@xmath3 stars than found for the cemp stars in the ihr .    the different mdfs and cemp - no / cemp-@xmath3 fractions between the stars we associate with the ihp and ohp suggest that these individual halo components have received contributions of the nucleosynthesis products from different astrophysical progenitors , and experienced different assembly histories .",
    "ultimately , this information can be used to constrain the mass distributions of the mini - halos from which they formed , as well as their star - formation histories .",
    "we are currently exploring maps of the spatial distributions for larger samples of cemp - no and cemp-@xmath3 stars , based on their identification from the yoon ",
    "beers diagram of @xmath2(c ) vs. [ fe / h ] ( figure 1 of @xcite ) , drawing on both the sdss and the large sky area multi - object fiber spectroscopic telescope ( lamost ; @xcite ) surveys .",
    "such maps can be compared with current and future numerical simulations of the formation of the halo of the mw . a new analysis of the kinematics for much larger samples of cemp - no and cemp-@xmath3 stars than previously considered , based on more recent high- and medium - resolution spectroscopic analyses , is also now underway , and should prove illuminating .",
