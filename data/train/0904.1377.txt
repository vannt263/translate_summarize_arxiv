    "in the current standard cosmological model , known as @xmath0cdm , galaxies like our own milky way are formed bottom - up , through the merger and accretion of smaller building blocks that come together due to their gravitational attraction ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this model is being continuously tested and many questions and puzzles remain to be addressed .",
    "an example is the large number of bound substructures predicted to orbit galaxies like the milky way and m31 compared to the observed abundance of satellite galaxies in these systems @xcite , although several solutions have been proposed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the formation of realistic disk galaxies in full cosmological simulations remains another great challenge ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) yet steady progress is being made ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one strong test of the current paradigm may be performed through observations of the stellar halos of galaxies like the milky way .",
    "for example , if the galaxy was formed in a hierarchical fashion via mergers , then we should be able to find fossil signatures of these events in the present day phase - space distribution of halo stars .",
    "this idea was strongly exalted after the discovery of the disrupting sgr dwarf galaxy by @xcite . in the following years further debris from accretion events was discovered , not only in the halo @xcite but also in the disk of our galaxy @xcite , although some of this substructure may be of dynamical origin @xcite .",
    "however , if the hierarchical scenario is correct , we are still far from having unveiled every single stream associated to each merger event the galaxy has experienced in its lifetime . @xcite by combining numerical simulations with analytic work predicted that there should be several hundreds of cold stellar streams present in the vicinity of the sun ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the short dynamical time scales , especially in the solar neighbourhood , are the basic reason behind why such a large number is expected .",
    "an accreted satellite , orbiting in the inner regions of the galaxy will give rise to multiple stellar streams in a relatively short period of time .",
    "as shown by @xcite the spatial density of these streams is a strongly decreasing function of time .",
    "consequently , substructure associated to a past accretion event is expected to have a very low - density contrast , making its detection very difficult from its distribution in space . on the other hand , due to the conservation of phase - space density ,",
    "the velocity dispersion of a stream will decrease as time goes by , making the streams tighter in the velocity domain .",
    "the arguments above highlight the need for full 6d phase - space information to completely disentangle the predicted wealth of substructure .",
    "furthermore , samples of at least 1,000 halo stars would appear to be necessary for this enterprise .",
    "statistical arguments using the revised nltt proper motion survey ( new luyten two tenths , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have been used to measure the amount of granularity ( associated to moving groups ) in the stellar halo near sun .",
    "@xcite has shown that no streams are present in this region of the galaxy that contain more than approximately 5% of the halo stars near the sun .",
    "this estimate is in good agreement with the expectations described above , but does not provide a direct confirmation of the predictions .",
    "spectroscopic surveys such as rave @xcite and segue @xcite should be helpful in identifying further nearby streams ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but the breakthrough will take place only with the astrometric satellite _ gaia _ @xcite .",
    "_ gaia _ , expected to be launched in 2011 , will measure the positions and motions of @xmath1 stars with very high accuracy .    given the datasets that soon will become available it is natural to ask what is the optimal way to discover merger debris .",
    "more precisely , the question we would like to address in this work is what is the best space to look for substructure if our goal is to disentangle how the galaxy was assembled .",
    "the first steps in this direction have been presented by @xcite . these authors analysed simulations of the disruption of satellite galaxies in a fixed galactic potential and concluded that the `` integrals - of - motion '' space defined by the energy , the total angular momentum and its @xmath2-component @xmath3 is very suitable for identifying the remains of past accretion events .",
    "even in fully self - consistent cosmological simulations , disrupted satellites still appear as coherent structures in this `` integrals of motion '' space @xcite .",
    "@xcite demonstrated the power of complementary chemical abundance information to disentangle debris from different events . @xcite",
    "have used for samples of nearby stars the space defined by @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the radial velocity in the galactic plane , and @xmath5 is the velocity component in the direction of rotation .",
    "more recently @xcite ( hereafter mb08 ) showed that action - angles coordinates , and in particular , the orbital frequencies could conform a very convenient set of variables to identify nearby substructure .    in this paper",
    "we explore further the power of the orbital frequencies .",
    "we start our journey by briefly reviewing the concept of action - angle variables in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we discuss in depth the space of orbital frequencies .",
    "we characterise the distribution of debris in a few simple cases and in particular , in a static spherical potential . in section 4",
    "we analyse how the structure of this space is altered in a time dependent ( still rigid ) potential .",
    "finally , in section 5 we focus on a live n - body simulation of the accretion of a massive satellite onto a pre - existing thin disk .",
    "we discuss and summarise our results in section 6 .",
    "let us consider a dynamical system with a time - independent hamiltonian @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a set of @xmath9 canonical coordinates .",
    "the dynamical state of this system is governed by the hamilton s equations @xmath10 with @xmath11 .",
    "the evolution of a system may be expressed much more simply by performing a canonical transformation of coordinates such that the equations of motion are @xmath12 with solutions @xmath13 if the system under study is such that the motion is periodic , then this set of canonical variables is known as action - angle variables .        in a spherical potential @xmath14 , the radial action is @xmath15r^{2}-l^{2}}}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the total angular momentum , @xmath17 and @xmath18 the turning points in the radial direction and @xmath19 are the angular actions .",
    "the frequencies of motion @xmath20 , can be derived by differentiation of the implicit function @xmath21r^{2}-l^{2}}}\\ ] ] defined by eq .",
    "( [ acts_rad ] ) . for more details , see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the space of orbital frequencies in the context of isolating debris from accreted satellites was first introduced by mb08 . for completeness",
    "we here review its main characteristics .",
    "we also refer the reader to section 4 of mb08 . for this purpose",
    "we have developed a simple toy - model and followed the evolution of a satellite in this space .",
    "let us consider a satellite ( i.e. a system of particles that are initially strongly clustered in phase - space ) orbiting under the influence of an arbitrary gravitational potential . for simplicity , we consider a system with only two independent frequencies of motion .",
    "we will also assume that the initial distribution in action - angle space of the satellite follows a multivariate gaussian with dispersions of @xmath22 and @xmath23 in the angles and actions , respectively ( and no correlation among the different directions ) .",
    "in this space , the location of a given particle will vary only due to the evolution of the angle coordinates . the rate of evolution , i.e. the frequencies , is completely determined by the underlying potential in which our satellite evolves ( see eq .",
    "( [ time_evol ] ) ) .",
    "the other two coordinates , i.e. , the actions , will remain constant in time .    here",
    "we shall assume that we can express the frequencies in the following way : @xmath24 where @xmath25 are constants .",
    "in general , the relation between the frequencies and the actions is more complex , and depends on the specific form of the gravitational potential .    typically , we have access to samples of stars located in a particular region of space such as , for example , the solar neighbourhood",
    ". this constraint acts as a filter , implying that we only observe the subset of stars with orbital properties such that they are in this particular location at the time of observation . to mimic this ,",
    "we focus on the particles located in a small region of the angles space in our toy - model .",
    "figure  [ fig : acts_om_evol ] shows the distribution of these particles in the space of actions and of frequencies at three different times ( @xmath26 ) .    as discussed by mb08 the particles passing through a particular location of (",
    "angle-)space are distributed in different patches or streams . with time , the number of streams increases while their extent in frequency space decreases .",
    "when the particles cross our location for the first time , they have not had enough time to become significantly spread in angle .",
    "we then observe only one big stream ( left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : acts_om_evol ] ) . at some later time , particles with the highest frequencies begin to overtake the slowest ones and therefore we observe multiple streams ( since the angles are periodic ) each with its own characteristic frequency .",
    "the size of each individual stream at any given time is dependent on the size of the small region under consideration and on the initial spread of the system .",
    "since the orbital frequencies are constant ( for a time independent gravitational potential ) the location of a particle in frequency space remains unchanged . the changing pattern shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : acts_om_evol ] is simply a consequence of the fact that we restrict our analysis to particles at a given spatial location .",
    "the gaps thus correspond to particles which are located outside our window .",
    "the network of patches is shaped by lines of constant frequency @xmath27 . as a consequence , and because of the relation implied by eq .",
    "( [ in_freqs ] ) , the distribution of particles in action space is also very regular .",
    "however , in general the relation between frequencies and actions will not be linear , and therefore the distribution of particles in action space is typically more complex ( see e.g. figure  [ fig : comp ] below ) .",
    "the number of clumps observed along each frequency direction at a given location can be estimated by considering the initial spread in the frequency .",
    "for example , at @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "after some time @xmath30 , the angle @xmath31 between the particles with the largest and smallest @xmath32 has increased to @xmath33 with @xmath34 the initial separation at time @xmath35 . since @xmath31 is a @xmath36-periodic variable the number of streams @xmath37 at @xmath28 is @xmath38 = \\left[\\frac{\\delta \\omega_{1 } t_{3 } +   \\delta \\theta_{1}(t_{0})}{2\\pi}\\right ]    \\approx \\left[\\frac{\\delta \\omega_{1 } t_{3}}{2\\pi}\\right]\\ ] ] where the last approximation holds if @xmath39 is long enough such that @xmath40 .",
    "another quantity of interest is the distance between two adjacent streams in frequency space , @xmath41 the time @xmath42 may be considered as the time since disruption of our system ( i.e. its constituent stars have been tidally stripped , and move only under the influence of the host gravitational field ) .",
    "( [ sep ] ) states that this time can be directly estimated by measuring @xmath43 .",
    "moreover , systems will have different values of @xmath43 depending on the time since disruption , which implies that this characteristic scale could be used to recognise the streams originating in objects plausibly accreted at different epochs .",
    "we now consider dynamical systems with an underlying spherical potential , @xmath14 .",
    "due to the conservation of angular momentum @xmath16 , the motion of stars are constrained to remain in a plane , implying that there are only two independent frequencies of motion : @xmath44 associated to the radial oscillation and @xmath45 associated to the angular oscillation in this plane .",
    "our previous analysis has shown that the space of frequencies appears to be well suited to identify streams . here",
    "we will characterise this space and how its properties depend on the form of the host gravitational potential .",
    ", as in the case of orbits in a homogeneous sphere .",
    "the dashed line shows @xmath46 , as found for all orbits in a point mass distribution .",
    "the left wedge of the distribution corresponds to circular orbits .",
    "bottom : relation between the radial frequency @xmath44 and the orbital apocentre - to - pericentre ratio.,width=302 ]    the angular and radial periods of an orbit are related to the respective frequencies through @xmath47 once a radial oscillation is completed the azimuthal angle has increased by an amount @xmath48 or , equivalently @xmath49 thus @xmath50     and @xmath46 respectively .",
    "note that because the hernquist inner density profile is cusped orbits with high frequencies do not bend over to the boundary associated with the homogeneous sphere.,width=302 ]    in general @xmath51 will not be a rational number and therefore the orbit will not be closed .",
    "however there are two gravitational potentials in which all orbits are closed , those of an homogeneous sphere and of a point mass . notice that any other spherical system may be considered to have a mass distribution between these limiting cases , i.e. its density gradient will be neither as shallow nor as steep as in these two cases .",
    "orbits in a time - independent homogeneous mass distribution have @xmath52 , whereas for the kepler problem @xmath53 . from eq .",
    "( [ os_relation ] ) this implies that the frequencies of a bound orbit in any spherical mass distribution are constrained to lie inside the subspace defined by @xmath54 .",
    "the extent to which this subspace is probed by orbits depends on the exact distribution of mass .    to examine this ,",
    "let us consider the plummer potential , @xmath55 , generated by a density @xmath56 , where @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "we sample the frequency space in this potential by randomly drawing @xmath58 orbits from the distribution function associated to the plummer sphere with parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 kpc .",
    "the upper panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : plum ] shows the distribution of these orbits in frequency space . the solid line and dashed lines correspond to @xmath61 ( homogeneous sphere ) and @xmath62 ( point mass ) , respectively .",
    "note that orbits with small frequencies cover the whole region between these two lines .",
    "instead , orbits with high frequencies tend to bend over towards the line given by the homogeneous sphere .",
    "this is because particles on orbits with low frequencies populate the outer regions of the system , and hence perceive a potential close to that of a point mass . on the other hand those on high frequency orbits are generally confined to the central regions of the system . since the plummer density profile has a core these particles will feel a potential resembling that of the homogeneous distribution .",
    "the strict cut - off at a value of @xmath63  gyr@xmath64 therefore corresponds to the characteristic frequency associated to the homogeneous mass distribution , i.e for @xmath65 , a particle in the plummer model should have a period of @xmath66 which in our case corresponds to @xmath67 gyr , or @xmath68 gyr@xmath64 .    for a given @xmath45 , ( nearly ) circular orbits will be those with the largest radial period , i.e. the smallest @xmath69 frequency .",
    "thus such orbits are located on the wedge seen in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : plum ] .",
    "this is also illustrated in the bottom panel of the same figure , where we have plotted the ratio of apocentre to pericentre distances of orbits as a function of @xmath44 .",
    "as we can see , orbits with the lowest @xmath44 for a given @xmath70 have @xmath71 .",
    "we now consider a system with a cuspy density distribution , namely the hernquist profile whose potential , @xmath55 , and density @xmath56 , are given by @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "we set @xmath73 and @xmath60 kpc .",
    "as before , we sample the available phase - space with 10@xmath74 orbits .",
    "the black points in fig .",
    "[ fig : hernq ] show the resulting distribution of orbits in frequency space . for comparison , we overplotted the frequencies for the plummer profile ( in grey ) . at the low frequencies",
    "end both distributions overlap as expected ( point mass regime ) .",
    "however there is a significant difference in the region populated by orbits with high frequencies .",
    "due to the lack of a core in the hernquist density distribution , the bend over towards @xmath75 , i.e. the regime of the homogeneous mass distribution , has disappeared , and there is no upper limit to the radial or angular frequency of motion .",
    "various spaces have been proposed to identify debris from disrupted satellites .",
    "for example , @xcite introduced the space of energy , total angular momentum and its @xmath2-component @xmath76 . later on",
    ", @xcite showed that substructure can be identified by looking at the apocentre , pericentre and @xmath77 space . in this space",
    ", streams are represented by extended structures , roughly along a line of constant eccentricity . in this section",
    "we will compare the distribution of debris in these and other previously used spaces to that in frequency space .",
    "to this end we consider the accretion of a satellite galaxy onto a spherical host .",
    "we represent the host with the plummer profile discussed in the previous section .",
    "the satellite is assumed to be spherical and to have an isotropic velocity ellipsoid , and is modelled with a multivariate gaussian in 6d with a dispersion of @xmath78 kpc and @xmath79 km / s@xmath64 .",
    "we set the central particle of the satellite on an orbit with apocentre @xmath80 kpc , pericentre @xmath81 kpc and inclined by 56 degrees with respect to the @xmath2-axis .",
    "we follow then the evolution of the satellite for approximately @xmath82 gyr . for simplicity , in this experiment the self - gravity of the satellite is not considered . as a consequence ,",
    "we expect to find a larger number of streams at any given epoch , with a larger spread in orbital parameters , in comparison to the self - gravitating case .",
    "this is because particles can drift apart from each other right from the start , whereas when their self - gravity is considered , this will only happen during successive pericentric passages where they are ( typically ) stripped from the parent satellite .    in fig .  [",
    "fig : real_sp ] we show the spatial distribution of satellite particles at three different times . to study the distribution of particles in various projections of phase - space we focus on those inside an sphere of radius @xmath83 kpc centred at @xmath84 kpc at the final time , as shown in the rightmost panel of this figure .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp ] for six different spaces .",
    "grey points represent all the particles of the satellite whereas black points only those inside the sphere of interest . in the top left corner ( panel a )",
    "we show their projection in frequency space . as in the toy model discussed in section [ sec : toy_model ] , for a given @xmath85 we find multiple streams in @xmath44 .",
    "note that there are typically more streams at constant @xmath45 than at constant @xmath44 .",
    "this is because @xmath86 , and hence mixing occurs faster in the @xmath87-direction .",
    "notice that some of the groups of particles found at given @xmath44 and @xmath88 may be decomposed into smaller structures .",
    "this can be understood from the radial velocity vs. radial distance plot shown in the bottom right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : comp ] . streams with pericentres inside the sphere under consideration , appear in frequency space as a single compact structure . for the rest",
    "we observe two separate structures , each of these associated to particles located just before or after their corresponding pericentre .",
    "the top right panel of fig .  [ fig : comp ] shows the distribution of particles in a projection of velocity space .",
    "although several features are visible , the individual streams are clearly less well separated than in panel a ) .",
    "this is also the case for the radial velocity vs. radial distance plot ( panel f ) .",
    "the two middle panels of fig .  [ fig : comp ] show the distribution of particles in the @xmath89 ( left ) and apocentre vs. pericentre ( right ) spaces .",
    "the number of structures in the @xmath89 space is smaller and slightly less sharp than in frequency space . on the other hand ,",
    "streams are well detached from each other in the apocentre vs. pericentre space .",
    "finally , in the bottom left panel we show the distribution of particles in the space of actions , @xmath90 vs. @xmath91 . as in the @xmath89 space , distinction of the various streams",
    "is less clear in this space , and hence it appears to be less suitable for finding individual debris streams .",
    "however , it is important to note that we are only considering two of the three available actions . by projecting the particle s distribution into the principal directions of action space",
    "it is also possible to find a well defined distribution of streams ( see figure 7 of mb08 ) .",
    "this analysis shows that frequency space is a very suitable space to identify streams associated to accretion events .",
    "moreover , as we explained in section [ sec : toy_model ] , the way streams are distributed in this space can allow us to estimate quantities such as time since disruption .",
    "this last characteristic makes the space of orbital frequencies more appealing than the other spaces previously considered .",
    "as discussed before the separation between adjacent streams along each direction of the space of orbital frequencies yields a direct estimate of the time since disruption , e.g. a satellite accreted 10 gyr ago should give rise to streams separated by a scale @xmath92 gyr@xmath64 .",
    "by considering information from the distribution of particles not only in frequency but also in angle space mb08 developed a powerful method that , by a process of iteration over a guess potential , allows to estimate time of disruption and to pin down the true underlying potential .    in this section",
    "we explore a different method which , only based on the regularity seen in frequency space , provides an accurate estimate of time since disruption .",
    "as an example we focus on the streams shown in panel a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : comp ] . because there is a unique scale ( all streams are separated by the same amount ) a straightforward way to compute the separation between adjacent streams is to use fourier analysis techniques .",
    "we proceed by first creating an image from the scatter plot in frequency space , to which we then apply a fourier transform . in the final step",
    "we compute the power spectrum . to obtain an image from our data we grid the frequency space with a regular @xmath93 mesh of bin size @xmath94 in both @xmath44 and @xmath45 directions . in this way , the number of particles in the @xmath95 bin of the grid is @xmath96 .",
    "we apply a two dimensional discrete fourier transform to this ] with @xmath97 .    in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ps_hr ] we show the image of the panel a ) of figure  [ fig : comp ] in fourier space .",
    "this has been computed on a grid of 200 by 200 elements .",
    "the axes represent the wavenumbers in each direction ( @xmath98 , @xmath99 ) while the colour coding show the square value of each of the fourier components @xmath100 . as we can see from this image , and",
    "as expected from our previous discussion , a regular pattern is present . to measure the characteristic scale we consider two different `` slits '' ( of 4 bins width ) of the fourier image around @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "these regions are delimited by the black lines in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ps_hr ] .",
    "we can now compute the one - dimensional power spectrum of the image along each direction as @xmath103\\\\ \\\\ $ for $ k_{r}=1,\\dots,\\left(\\frac{n}{2}-1\\right),\\\\ \\\\",

    "recall that the one - dimensional power spectrum we compute is , in practice , an average over the slits considered along the @xmath105 and @xmath106 directions .    .",
    "the black lines denote the regions selected in the fourier image to compute the 1-d power spectra , i.e. around @xmath102 ( middle panel ) and @xmath101 ( lower panel ) . the black vertical lines in these panels show the location of the peak with the highest power in the spectrum.,width=241 ]    the results are shown in the middle and the bottom panels of figure  [ fig : ps_hr ] , for @xmath107 and @xmath104 , respectively .",
    "the scales present in the power spectrum @xmath107 are associated to separations in the @xmath44 direction ( since they correspond to @xmath102 ) .",
    "the large power for wavenumbers close to zero , i.e. @xmath108 represents the average power over the whole image .",
    "all other peaks in the spectrum are related to waves resonating with our image .",
    "in particular the first peak , with the highest power , is associated to a wavenumber of @xmath109 gyr , and is denoted by the vertical black line in the spectrum .",
    "the corresponding wavelength of this peak is @xmath110 gyr@xmath64 @xmath111 gyr@xmath64 .",
    "this is in fact the separation we would have estimated using eq . ( [ sep ] ) and corresponds to an estimated time since accretion of @xmath112 gyr .",
    "the rest of the peaks in the spectrum are associated to the harmonics of this wavenumber , i.e. , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , etc .",
    "the situation is similar when we consider a cut around @xmath101 . in this case",
    "the scales present in the power spectrum are associated to separations in the @xmath45 direction .",
    "we find the peak with the highest amplitude to be at the same wavenumber @xmath115 and it is possible to distinguish some of its harmonics .",
    "however , due to the smaller number of streams we have in the @xmath45 direction , the peaks are less clearly defined than for @xmath116 .    the fourier method developed in this section",
    "may be considered to be very complementary to that introduced by mb08 .",
    "even if the gravitational potential is only approximately known , streams in frequency space will still distributed on a lattice ( see below and sec .",
    "4.3 of mb08 ) .",
    "this implies that a fourier analysis technique will ( always ) provide an estimate of the time since accretion . instead , in the presence of a very clear set of streams mb08 s method",
    "can be used not only to provide a more accurate estimate of the time since accretion but also to narrow down the true underlying potential .",
    "in a hierarchical universe , the gravitational potentials associated to galaxies are expected to have changed over time . under these circumstances ,",
    "quantities such as the energy , apocentre and pericentre and also the frequencies of individual orbits will no longer be conserved .",
    "it is therefore of special interest to study how a time dependent potential affects the structure of debris in frequency space .    to this end",
    ", we consider a simple model of a satellite accreted onto a plummer sphere whose mass varies according to @xmath117 where we explore several values for the time scale , @xmath118 .",
    "the growth in mass will lead to a shrinking of the possible orbits , and be manifested in an increase in the frequencies and acceleration experienced by the particles with time .      to derive the evolution of the frequencies of motion for an orbit in a time - dependent mass distribution such as that given by eq .",
    "( [ m_t ] ) , we proceed as follows . at each step of this orbit s time - integration",
    ", we take the instantaneous position and velocity as initial conditions to compute an orbit in the instantaneous ( frozen ) associated potential . then , for this orbit we derive an instantaneous set of frequencies .",
    "we will consider the evolution of two different orbits : an initially outer orbit with an apocentre of @xmath119 kpc and pericentre of @xmath120 kpc , and a second inner orbit with @xmath121 kpc and @xmath122 kpc .",
    "the initial values of the frequencies of the outer orbit are @xmath123 gyr@xmath64 and @xmath124 gyr@xmath64 , whereas for the inner one they are @xmath125 gyr@xmath64 and @xmath126 gyr@xmath64 .",
    "both orbits are launched from their apocentre .",
    "let us first consider a slowly varying potential , where @xmath127 gyr .",
    "we follow the evolution of the orbit over @xmath128 gyr .",
    "the top panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : jr_evol ] shows the time evolution of the radial action @xmath90 for this case , where black and light - grey lines in this figure correspond to the outer and the inner orbit respectively .",
    "this figure shows that the instantaneous action @xmath90 displays an oscillatory behaviour , with a period that corresponds to that of the orbit .",
    "this is not surprising since under adiabatic variations of the potential it is the time average of the actions that remains constant ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in general , for a given orbit",
    "the amplitude of the oscillation depends on the time scale on which the potential grows . by increasing @xmath118",
    "the evolution is more adiabatic and the amplitude of the oscillation is decreased .    in order for an orbit to be in a condition of adiabatic invariance it is necessary that @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is the orbital period .",

    "orbits are continuously driven towards deeper regions of the well , implying that the corresponding orbital periods decrease with time .",

    "we ran simulations with the same satellite and orbital initial conditions as described in section [ sec : comp ] .",

    "the top panel presents the results for @xmath147 gyr while the bottom panel corresponds to @xmath145 gyr .",
    "as we can see from this figure , even in a time dependent system , satellite debris at a given spatial location is distributed in a regular pattern of patches in the space of orbital frequencies .    in the simulation where the time evolution is slow ( i.e. , @xmath147 gyr ) some of the structures",
    "may be decomposed into two clumps . as we explained in section",
    "[ sec : comp ] , such structures appear when neither the apocentre nor the pericentre of the orbits fall inside the sphere under consideration .",
    "in contrast , when the potential evolves quickly the particles in each stream are all distributed in compact single structures .",
    "this is because in this case the orbits have shrunk so much after @xmath82 gyr that all streams present in this volume have their apocentres inside the chosen sphere .",
    "comparison to the case in which the potential is fixed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : comp ] ) shows that streams in the @xmath44 direction are not exactly distributed along a line of @xmath70 but rather on a line with a given curvature .",
    "this is due to the fact that orbits with different initial frequencies evolve at different rates ( as discussed in the previous section ) .",
    "the amount of curvature observed in this space ( e.g. figure [ fig : plum_tevol ] ) depends on the rate of evolution of the potential .",
    "this is schematically depicted in figure  [ fig : esquema ] .",
    "particles located close to the homogeneous sphere regime , will evolve at rates @xmath148 , while those with orbits closer to the point mass distribution regime will evolve at rates more similar to @xmath149 , i.e. , four times faster .",
    "note that since the particles in the plummer sphere occupy a smaller region in frequency space than that delimited by these two regimes , the difference in their rate of evolution will typically be smaller than the estimate just provided .",
    "if by the final time @xmath150 , the particles satisfy the condition @xmath151 their associated streams will be located along a curve roughly as depicted in this figure .",
    "note that the extent of the distribution of particles in frequency space has also changed , but since this is also dependent on the initial internal properties of the satellite , it can not be used to directly measure the evolution of the potential .",
    "we may conclude from these experiments that the time evolution modelled here for the host potential does not destroy the coherence of satellite debris in frequency space .",
    "furthermore , since the frequencies evolve at different rates even for particles with same origin , it may be possible to recover the evolution of the host potential by measuring the curvature of the lines over which the streams are distributed in frequency space .",
    "note that this implies that the host s evolution has left its imprints in the present day orbits of accreted stars .",

    "when @xmath157 is considered , the highest amplitude peak is located at a wavenumber @xmath158 gyr , corresponding to an estimated time of accretion of @xmath159 gyr .",
    "therefore , in this example the analysis of the power spectrum suggests different times of accretion depending on whether @xmath44 or @xmath45 are considered .",
    "both values are reasonably close to the actual accretion time ( @xmath82 gyr ago ) , but the direction associated to @xmath44 appears to provide a better estimate .",

    "we have also performed an experiment in which an axisymmetric thin disk was grown adiabatically inside an initially spherical ( plummer ) mass distribution .",

    "the previous analysis has shown that frequency space is particularly well suited for identifying streams from mergers , at least for the idealised potentials considered thus far .",
    "we now explore a more realistic case , namely that of a minor merger with a live host .",
    "we use one of the simulations of @xcite ( hereafter vh08 ) , that model the formation of a thick disk via the merger of a relatively massive satellite onto a pre - existing thin disk .",
    "two important physical processes take place during the merger which may affect the structure of the debris in frequency space .",
    "first , the satellite suffers significant dynamical friction .",
    "secondly , the host system responds strongly to the perturber , resulting in a disk that has been significantly tilted and heated .",
    "this implies that , even though the total mass of the system is conserved , its distribution evolves in time .",
    "the vh08 simulation that we consider here corresponds to a two component satellite ( stars + dark matter ) launched on a @xmath178 inclination orbit with respect to the disk from a distance of approximately @xmath179 kpc ( @xmath180 disk scale lengths ) .",
    "the host consists of a ( live ) dark halo and a ( live ) thin disk .",
    "the total ( and the stellar ) mass ratio between the satellite and the host is @xmath181 .",
    "after @xmath182 gyr of evolution , the satellite is fully disrupted and has deposited debris in the disk of the host .",
    "the host disk is significantly thickened by this process and shows characteristics typical of thick disks .",
    "the remnant system modelled by vh08 does not have a separable gravitational potential which prevent us from deriving explicitly the action - angles variables using eq .",
    "( [ hamilton_prim])-([time_evol ] ) .",
    "nevertheless several methods have been developed to obtain the frequencies of orbits in general potentials .",
    "here we focus on the spectral analysis approach , introduced by @xcite , which relies on the numerical integration of the equations of motion in a given potential .",
    "the basic idea is to perform a fourier transform of the time series @xmath183 ( i.e. , the orbit ) , and then to derive the frequencies of motion .    to obtain a reliable fourier spectrum the orbits must be integrated for a very large number of periods",
    "however , in the problem under consideration the orbits are not stationary , i.e. the frequencies are time dependent and so this approach can not be applied directly using the orbits from the n - body simulation .",
    "this is why we have used the final output of the simulation to define a set of initial conditions which we integrate in a fixed ( static ) potential .",
    "this potential should ressemble that of our simulation , and for simplicity we have taken a two component model , consisting in a miyamoto - nagai disk @xcite @xmath184 and nfw dark matter halo @xcite @xmath185 we have set the parameters of the model to @xmath186 , @xmath187 kpc and @xmath188 kpc ; @xmath189 km@xmath190  s@xmath191 and @xmath192 kpc .",
    "these choices lead to a potential energy distribution that differs by at most 5 per cent from the true potential up to a radius of @xmath193 kpc on the @xmath194 plane .",
    "this radius is large enough to enclose the apocentres of 99% of the particles presently found in a volume resembling the solar neighbourhood .",
    "we thus integrate the orbits of the stellar particles located in such a volume for approximately @xmath195 orbital periods and compute their frequencies using the code developed by @xcite .",
    "note that the results are not strongly dependent on our particular choice of the potential , since substructure in integrals of motion space @xcite and in frequency space ( mb08 ) are both robust to small differences in the mass distribution .",

    "that is , we assign to each grid element @xmath204 particles , where this number is drawn from a poisson distribution with mean @xmath205 , i.e. equal to average number of stellar particles per grid element .",
    "we then compute the fourier transform of this distribution and the corresponding 1-dimensional power spectra from the image .",

    "the black solid line in each panel denotes the power spectrum obtained from the actual distribution of particles in frequency space .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to the average power spectrum for our random distributions where the vertical error bars represent the rms dispersion around this average spectrum .",

    "the wavenumber of this peak is @xmath206 gyr for both the radial and angular directions .",
    "this corresponds to an estimated accretion time of @xmath207 gyr . recall that this simulation is evolved for @xmath182 gyr",
    "however , the satellite only starts to lose a significant amount of stars @xmath208 gyr after infall ( see figure 3 of vh08 ) .",
    "therefore , we may conclude that the time since disruption of a satellite can be reasonably estimated even in a simulation with a live host .",
    "we have confirmed and extended previous work by mb08 showing that orbital frequencies constitute a very suitable space to identify debris from past accretion events . in this space , particles in a given volume of physical space",
    "are found to populate well - defined lumps , each of them associated with a different stream .    for time - independent potentials ,",
    "these streams are distributed in a regular pattern along lines of constant frequency .",
    "as time goes by , the number of streams at a given physical location increases while the separation between adjacent streams decreases .",
    "we have shown here that this characteristic separation or scale can be used to estimate the time of accretion of the object through a fourier analysis .",
    "we have also addressed how the time evolution of the host affects substructure in frequency space . as an example",
    ", we have considered the case in which the mass of the host is increased exponentially in time on two different timescales .",
    "we find that in contrast with the actions which are adiabatic invariants for slowly varying potentials , the frequencies always evolve in time , closely following the rate of change of the host potential .",
    "this evolution however does not destroy the clumpiness present in frequency space .",
    "streams still look lumpy and are regularly distributed in this space , even if the host potential varies on a very short timescale ( when even the actions are no longer invariant ) .",
    "interestingly in this case , streams are not exactly distributed along straight lines of constant frequency but rather on lines whose curvature depends on the timescale of growth of the potential .",
    "this implies that , contrary to previous claims ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the final distribution of streams does retain information on the evolution in time of the host .",
    "finally , we have analysed a full n - body simulation of the accretion of a satellite galaxy onto a disk galaxy . due to the inclusion of other physical processes ( such as self - gravity , dynamical friction and the variation in time of the distribution of mass in the system )",
    ", the distribution of satellite particles in frequency space looks somewhat less regular than in the previously discussed idealised cases .",
    "nevertheless , the space of frequencies is still rich in substructure associated to streams .",
    "furthermore , even in this case fourier analysis techniques can be used to estimate the time of accretion reasonably well , although in general , only a lower limit is obtained .",
    "for all these examples we have compared the final distribution of streams in the most commonly used spaces to identify satellite debris .",
    "these comparisons have shown that frequency space contains information that is either not present or is not simply obtained in other spaces . in general streams",
    "are most sharply defined in frequency space .",
    "one important simplification in our analysis is to consider the accretion of a single satellite galaxy . in reality",
    ", the process of the formation of a galaxy like the milky way will have involved many mergers ( in the range of @xmath209 , see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "therefore it is possible , and even likely , that their debris will overlap in frequency space .",
    "however , as we have shown , the separation between adjacent streams in frequency space is predicted to be different for mergers that took place at different epochs .",
    "moreover , the location of their debris in frequency space at the present time is dependent upon the initial orbital conditions .",
    "consequently we expect the overlap to be incomplete and hence the identification of their remnants to be feasible .",

    "<S> we study the evolution of satellite debris to establish the most suitable space to identify past merger events . we confirm that the space of orbital frequencies is very promising in this respect . in frequency space individual streams can be easily identified , and their separation provides a direct measurement of the time of accretion . </S>",
    "<S> we are able to show for a few idealised gravitational potentials that these features are preserved also in systems that have evolved strongly in time . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , this time evolution is imprinted in the distribution of streams in frequency space . </S>",
    "<S> we have also tested the power of the orbital frequencies in a fully self - consistent ( live ) n - body simulation of the merger between a disk galaxy and a massive satellite . even in this case </S>",
    "<S> streams can be easily identified and the time of accretion of the satellite can be accurately estimated .    </S>",
