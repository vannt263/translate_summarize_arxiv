    "these metallic nanowires sustain propagating surface plasmon polaritons .",
    "such excitations are surface waves that propagate along the nanowires over extended distances @xcite . in such geometries ,",
    "the quantum states of qubits encoded in quantum dots , atoms , or even molecules can be entangled by bringing them in close proximity to the nanowire . for identical qubits ,",
    "a maximal degree of entanglement can be obtained by choosing a suitable relative coupling strengths to the nanowire @xcite . in this scheme , multipartite entanglement between the qubits and the plasmons is achieved and followed by a measurement of a number of plasmonic excitations at the terminations of the nanowire .",
    "only if no plasmons are detected , it can be concluded that the qubits were maximally entangled with each other .    to circumvent this probabilistic character and to generate high degrees of entanglement in deterministic schemes ,",
    "it was suggested to asymmetrically place the qubits with respect to the nanowire . for definite coupling strengths a maximal degree of entanglement",
    "could be achieved regardless of the state of the plasmonic field @xcite .",
    "however , large losses associated with propagating surface plasmons prevent this entanglement to persist for longer time scales .",
    "an idea of using the loss channels to drive the qubits into a subradiant state that is robust against dissipation was investigated in ref .  .",

    "this is why @xmath118 drops for large values of @xmath15 .",
    "the concurrence is further decreased due to the increased probability of the bi - excited state occupation @xmath132 [ see the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : concurrence_reduced ] ) ] . however , it is important to stress that a concurrence close to unity can be obtained in a large parameter space .",
    "( a ) the steady - state probability of the antisymmetric state @xmath118 and ( b ) the steady - state concurrence @xmath119 as functions of the normalized coupling constant @xmath120 and driving field @xmath121 , for two qubits anti - symmetrically detuned from the nanoantenna resonance : @xmath133 , and vacuum - induced spontaneous emission rate @xmath134 . ]      it is important to double - check the sensitivity of the results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : results_g_omega ] against variations of nominal parameters of the system which might be eventually caused by experimental imperfections .",
    "the steady - state concurrence as a function of the normalized qubit - transition - frequency detunings from the nanoantenna resonance @xmath135 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : how_robust](a ) for @xmath136 , @xmath66 .",
    "as expected , the concurrence vanishes for identical qubits , i.e. for @xmath137 , and grows fast for very small transition - frequency differences ( the apparent discontinuity is a result of imperfect resolution of the figure ) .",
    "the result proved to be robust against small deviations from the optimal conditions : the concurrence remains high even if the absolute values of the detunings @xmath138 are not equal , as long as they have opposite signs .",
    "( for the nanoantenna parameters described in ref .  , this corresponds to a tolerance of a few thz for the concurrence to exceed @xmath139 . )",
    "when the detunings are too large , however , the qubits are no longer in exact resonance with the nanoantenna and the driving field , which leads to smaller concurrence .",
    "( a ) the steady - state concurrence @xmath119 as a function of normalized detunings of the qubits @xmath140 and @xmath141 , for the coupling constant @xmath142 .",
    "( b ) concurrence as a function of different qubit - nanoantenna coupling constants @xmath143 and @xmath144 , for a symmetric detuning @xmath145 . in both cases",

    "we proceed in analyzing the steady - state concurrence for unequal coupling constants @xmath91 .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : how_robust](b ) for @xmath122 , @xmath146 , @xmath66 .",
    "interestingly , even though such imperfect configuration leads to additional asymmetry in the system , it results in smaller degrees of steady - state entanglement .",
    "this is because for unequal coupling constants the antisymmetric state undergoes a decay with a rate proportional to @xmath147 [ see the third of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dicke3 ] ) ] .",
    "consequently , its steady - state probability is smaller .",
    "this is in agreement with the results obtained in refs .  , where asymmetric placements of the qubits with respect to a nanowire or a microtoroid were considered for the purpose of entanglement generation at short time - scales .",
    "the resulting entanglement did not , however , persist in the steady - state .",
    "such sensitivity of the concurrence to the coupling strengths implies in particular a need for precisely placing the qubits with respect to the nanoantenna surface .",
    "this seems to be within the reach of the state - of - the - art technology , which allows for a control over the qubit - to - nanoantenna distance with a sub - nanometer resolution @xcite .    in the last section",
    "we have numerically solved the lindblad - kossakowski equation to confirm that a very large degree of stationary interqubit entanglement , with concurrence reaching one , can be obtained with two qubits of different transition frequencies , symmetrically coupled to a nanoantenna .",
    "we have found that the scheme is robust against perturbations in the detuning of the qubits from the nanoantenna resonance .",
    "for the steady - state concurrence to be large it is however crucial that the antisymmetric state remains strongly subradiant , i.e. that the effective loss rates of all qubits are equal .",
    "this requires a precise positioning of the qubits with respect to the nanoantenna .",
    "a cavity - qed formulation of the problem of two qubits coupled to a single nanoantenna resonance has been considered in the context of interqubit entanglement generation .",
    "the underlying physical mechanisms were analyzed by a simplistic effective description , strictly valid in the weak - coupling regime only .",
    "the effective description directly leads to the conclusion that the qubits may be driven into a maximally entangled steady state for symmetric coupling to the mode of the nanoantenna , but an antisymmetry in the transition frequencies of the qubits .",
    "great advantages of the proposed scheme are that ( 1 ) it is independent of the initial state of the system ; and ( 2 ) it is robust against dissipation through channels associated with both the nanoantenna and the qubits",
    ". however sensitive to deviations in the coupling strength between the qubits and the nanoantenna field , the proposed scheme has been proven stable with respect to perturbations in their spectral properties .",
    "implementation of entanglement generation and more complicated quantum - information protocols with plasmonic structures promises faster quantum computing with miniaturized devices .",
