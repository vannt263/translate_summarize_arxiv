    "this sharp peak is smeared by detector response times and by the finite coincidence window ( implemented in software ) , respectively characterised by @xmath0 and @xmath21 ( @xmath22 in the original text ) .",
    "the authors of @xcite model these effects by means of convolution functions . for the purposes of this comment",
    "it is sufficient to consider @xmath23 ; in this case the combined response function of the hardware - software setup is equivalent to a moving - window average with size @xmath24 and transition regions as large as @xmath25 .",
    "the time - averaged second - order coherence @xmath19 , proportional to the measured rate of signal - idler coincidences @xmath26 , will be equal to one for @xmath27 , and to a constant when @xmath28 , _",

    "since @xmath31mhz and @xmath32ns , the additional term in eq.[eq : g2si ] is still of the order of @xmath33 , and therefore the signal - idler temporal correlation is relatively easily to demonstrate .",
    "of course , this signal - idler peak could be made arbitrary large by reducing the rate @xmath2 ( in practice , by reducing the intensity of the pump , as in ( * ? ? ? * fig.4 ) ) . at the same time , given that both time scales of the experimental convolution function , @xmath34ps and @xmath35ns , are several orders of magnitude larger than the coherence time @xmath14ps , the experiment is only sensitive to the integral of the peak , and not to a specific peak model .",

    "the authors of the brief report claim that good agreement between theory and experimental data proves that their model is particularly accurate , but indeed it is only the dependence on @xmath21 that is truly confirmed , and repeating data analysis with different values is just a test that the software is working correctly .",

    "all non - constant terms die out , and @xmath53 ; for @xmath54 the shape is peaked , and its maximum value does not exceed four times its large - delay value , as shown in fig.[fig : g2c ] .",

    "therefore the function of interest , @xmath58 , represented in fig.[fig : g2c ] , has unit value for @xmath59 , and is @xmath60 for @xmath61 .    experimentally measuring a time - averaged version of this",
    "well is far from trivial , since the size of the well is only @xmath62 , and the typical convolution spread due to detector jitter and finite coincidence windows is @xmath21 , so that the effect is in the best case @xmath63 , and even smaller with the coincidence windows used in the article .",
    "this is an effect of the same order of magnitude as that measured in @xcite on an almost identical physical system .",
    "instead , fig.3 of @xcite shows a large well extending over @xmath5ns or more .",
    "the reason for this strange result is that the authors actually plot the `` time - averaged second - order correlation function '' @xmath64 defined as @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the already mentioned signal - idler coincidence rate , and @xmath67 is the triple signal - signal - idler coincidence rate , proportional to a smeared .",
    "it is important to understand that even if @xmath68 is studied for @xmath50 , the observable @xmath67 is the outcome of a triple - coincidence experiment , and its value is linked to the full three - time structure of @xmath42 , shown in fig.[fig : pssi ] .",
    "minor details apart , @xmath69 is characterised by three levels : the accidental triple - coincidence plateau at @xmath70 , the signal - idler coincidence ridges at @xmath71 ( when @xmath72 or @xmath73 ) , and a more complicated central peak ( when both @xmath74 $ ] ) where the correlation grows even more , up to a factor four .    the experimental rate @xmath67 is obtained by convoluting @xmath42 with the response functions of three detectors and two coincidence windows",
    ". the effect can be modelled as a moving average with a square bidimensional averaging window of area @xmath75 and transition regions of size @xmath76",
    ". the value of @xmath67 will then be significantly different from @xmath70 only when the averaging window is close to one of the ridges of fig.[fig : pssi ] ; due to translation invariance the result is @xmath77 $ ] as before .",
    "but when the averaging window sits at @xmath78 both ridges participate to the average and their contribution is twice as large : @xmath79 $ ] . note that the complicated peak at the ridge junction is almost irrelevant since its contribution relative to @xmath80 is only @xmath81 , due to its height being limited and its base being only @xmath82 , and not @xmath83 as for the part of each ridge within the averaging window .",
    "the ideal triple - coincidence rate @xmath69 ( only most relevant structures shown ) .",
    "the ridges running parallel to the axes @xmath50 and @xmath84 are given by signal - idler correlation .",
    "when both @xmath85 and @xmath86 are very close to @xmath46 correlations are increased by a factor at most four .",
    "@xmath42 is symmetric under @xmath87 , i.e. , around the dash - dotted bisector .",
    "the function floor is the accidental triple rate @xmath70 . ]",
    "the expected experimental triple - coincidence rate @xmath88 , obtained from the ideal triple - coincidence rate @xmath69 of fig.[fig : pssi ] by means of a moving bidimensional averaging window of area @xmath89 and transition regions of size @xmath25 .",
    "the central structure is in practice not related to the central peak of fig.[fig : pssi ] .",
    "the scales of time axes in fig.[fig : pssi ] and [ fig : nssi ] differ by more than three orders of magnitude .",
    "the floor of the function is again the accidental triple rate @xmath70 . ]",
    "the conclusion of the previous discussion is that the expected shape of the coincidence functions is not available in ref.@xcite , but it is given in ( * ? ? ? * fig .  5 ) , and it corresponds to the analysis just given ( see fig.[fig : nssi ] here ) .",
    "the authors of @xcite claim that the peak at the centre of ( * ? ? ?",
    "5 ) represents the contribution of multiple photon pairs , but this is clearly wrong , since it is just an artifact of the averaging method .",
    "in fact , the peak height is twice as large as the height along the ridges , and not more as should be expected from fig.[fig : pssi ] ( the authors blame this discrepancy on the 50/50 beam - splitter , but this explanation is incorrect since the beam - splitter influences all rates in the same way ) . ] are @xmath90 where `` long '' and `` short '' delays mean approximately @xmath91 and @xmath92 respectively .",
    "it is not surprising that only the accidental - coincidence factor , @xmath70 , and the signal - idler coincidence - peak factor , @xmath93 , show up in the formula for @xmath67 : all signal - signal effects are in fact too small to be detectable unless explicitly looked for .",
    "the graph of @xmath64 , eq.[eq : defgcav ] , is therefore @xmath94 this conclusion is quantitatively confirmed by visual inspection of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fig .  3 and fig .",
    "4 ) ( in the limit @xmath95 of course but the convolution time scale is still much larger than @xmath3 , then eqs.[eq : nthree_result]-[eq : gcav_result ] hold valid with @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the height of the plateau of the convolution function . ] ) .",
    "therefore , far from addressing the probability of detecting two signal photons conditioned on the detection of an idler photons , these authors are again just measuring the temporal correlation between the signal and idler arm .",
    "let us come back to the definition of second - order signal coherence _ conditioned _ on the detection of an idler photon at time @xmath46 , given in eq.[eq : def_gc ] .",
    "this is the standard definition of glauber s @xmath98 , but over a post - measurement state obtained by applying the idler measurement operator to the unconditioned spdc density matrix : @xmath99}.\\ ] ] the resulting state is of course not time invariant , because of the introduction of the parameter @xmath46 .",
    "equivalently , one can use modified observables for the evaluation of expectation values on the original state : @xmath100    the usefulness of the @xmath101 function for a _ time - invariant _ field is that it is insensitive to detector efficiencies and depends only on @xmath102 , proportional to the probability ( or rate , for a continuous field ) of finding two photons at times @xmath85 and @xmath86 . if @xmath103 decreases ( increases ) in some neighbourhood of @xmath104 the field",
    "is said to be _ bunched _ _",
    "( anti - bunched ) _ , meaning that photons `` prefer '' to come together ( alone ) .",
    "if @xmath105 is smaller ( larger ) than one the field statistics in a sufficiently small time window is sub - poissonian ( super - poissonian ) .",
    "however , due to the introduction of the idler time @xmath46 , the conditioned spdc field is no more time invariant , and turns out not to be proportional to the rate of arrival of signal photons at time @xmath85 and @xmath86 , because the normalisation factors in the denominator of eq.[eq : def_gc ] are not constant .",
    "for instance , if @xmath86 is set to a very large time , using eqs.[eq : formula_gc ] , [ eq : formula_ratessi ] , and [ eq : value_gsi ] it is immediate to find that @xmath106 irrespectively of the delay @xmath107 , although the detection rate on the first signal detector is much larger when @xmath50 with respect to the case @xmath108 , due to signal - idler correlation .",
    "therefore @xmath109 is not a good substitute for detection rates ; one should instead directly use the probability density of detecting signal photons at times @xmath85 and @xmath86 provided an idler photon was detected at time @xmath46 , which , due to bayes theorem , is just the triple - coincidence rate @xmath69 divided by @xmath2 .",
    "it is also to be remarked that the last two special cases described in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* pag.3 , right ) , which should presumably corroborate the idea that @xmath109 is a sensible figure of merit , can also be obtained from @xmath42 .",
    "specifically , these examples concern the fact that @xmath3 is the signal - idler `` coherence time '' , @xmath110     and that unconditioned signal - signal events are thermal , @xmath111    on the other hand , instead of showing any sign of sub - poissonian behaviour , as the last special case @xmath112 seems to suggest , the point @xmath113 is the maximum of @xmath42 .",
    "this is in agreement with the fact that one - arm spdc radiation is thermal : if an idler photon was detected at time @xmath46 and a signal photon at time @xmath50 , then the most likely time for a second signal photon to appear is just @xmath84 .",
    "it is shown that the experimental findings reported in ( * ? ? ?",
    "3 and  4 ) about conditioned signal - signal coincidences in an spdc source are indeed related not to the conditioned second - order signal - signal coherence , but to the much simpler ( to measure ) and stronger signal - idler correlation .",
