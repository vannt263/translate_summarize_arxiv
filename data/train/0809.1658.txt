    "in the past couple of decades there has been a tremendous effort , both theoretical and experimental , to try to understand the electroweak scale .",
    "an important driving force has come from the desire to understand how this scale is related , if at all , to other scales in nature such as the planck scale .",
    "dynamical symmetry breaking through strong interactions provides a beautiful conceptual framework for understanding naturally hierarchically different scales .",
    "the analogy with the qcd interactions played a prominent role in the application of the idea to the generation of the electroweak ( ew ) scale itself , when the technicolor model was introduced in the late 1970 s  @xcite .",
    "fermion masses were later introduced via extended technicolor ( etc )  @xcite ( for recent developments see  @xcite ) . because of the difficulty in generating a large top quark mass in the etc theory , a more natural proposal where top quark condensation breaks the electroweak symmetry was first proposed in  @xcite , and later developed in  @xcite .",
    "fitting the observed top quark mass was finally possible in the context of the top seesaw model  @xcite ( see @xcite for a comprehensive study ) .",
    "more recently , extra - dimensional scenarios  @xcite have led to a simple realization of the basic ingredients of topcolor models  @xcite . for",
    "a review of strong dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking and an extended list of references , see  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we assume that the standard model ( sm ) fields propagate in a 5d _ warped _ background  @xcite , resulting in strong interactions that lead to a simple picture where the ew symmetry is broken by a fermion - anti fermion condensate .",
    "the source of the strong interactions responsible for the condensate is related to the 5d @xmath4 qcd interactions , specifically to the gluon kk modes , which can easily be sufficiently strong to trigger the condensation .",
    "our main observation is that the resulting vacuum energy in the presence of the condensate depends on the separation between the `` ultraviolet '' ( uv ) and `` infrared '' ( ir ) branes , @xmath5 .",
    "this is because the kk gluon masses and the couplings of the condensing fermions to the kk gluons are @xmath5-dependent so that the vacuum energy in the presence of condensation is also @xmath5-dependent .",
    "thus , a potential for the radion field is induced .",
    "crucially , the ( electroweak induced ) vacuum energy has a minimum that naturally leads to an inter - brane distance parametrically larger than the 5d curvature scale . as a result",
    ", the planck , the kaluza - klein ( kk ) and the electroweak scales are all related dynamically .",
    "it is widely appreciated that a complete solution to the hierarchy problem within warped scenarios  @xcite requires a specification of a radion stabilization mechanism .",
    "notice that , unlike the well - known goldberger - wise mechanism for radion stabilization  @xcite , we do not add by hand dynamics for the sole purpose of stabilizing the radion field . in this sense ,",
    "our mechanism is closer in spirit to the proposal of radion stabilization through casimir energies  @xcite .",
    "we go beyond the previous proposals in that the stabilization of the distance between the branes is directly related to electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) , and leads to a rather non - trivial link between various scales in the theory ( however , see  @xcite ) .",
    "we illustrate the radion stabilization mechanism in a simple toy model in section  [ sec : basic ] .",
    "the mechanism can be studied within an effective nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model  @xcite in the large @xmath6 limit .",
    "we show , in particular , that the ew induced potential has a well - defined minimum . based on this potental ,",
    "the planck / ew scale hierarchy is obtained provided a certain coupling is about 10% above a critical value .",
    "the size @xmath5 is adjusted dynamically and one finds that , when the planck / ew scale ratio is reproduced , the kk scale is predicted to be a factor of about 200 above the ew scale .",
    "thus , the radion stabilization mechanism we propose not only explains the large hierarchy between the planck and ew scales , but also the little hierarchy between the kk and ew scales .",
    "furthermore , the relaxation of the radion field to the minimum of the potential energy ensures that typically only one of the fermions condenses , the one closest to the ir brane . in the context of the sm ,",
    "the top quark is the most natural candidate to condense .",
    "we also discuss other , casimir - like contributions to the radion potential that need to be suppressed for the little hierarchy above to survive .",
    "such suppression may be obtained in the presence of additional fermionic degrees of freedom .    in section  [ sec : topseesaw ]",
    "we propose a simple model that accommodates the fermion masses , including the top quark mass : the @xmath7 gauge fields and the sm fermion field content are supplemented by an additional quark field with the quantum numbers of the right - handed ( rh ) top quark , and are assumed to propagate in the bulk of a warped 5d space .",
    "there is no _ fundamental _ scalar field .",
    "we choose boundary conditions such that at energies below the kk scale , there is one _ vector - like _",
    "fermion @xmath8 , in addition to the sm fermions .",
    "we assume that the sm fermion closest to the ir brane is one of the @xmath9 quark doublets ( which is then identified as the left - handed ( lh ) third generation quark doublet ) .",
    "its condensation partner is a linear combination of the rh top quark and @xmath10 , which is the most general and natural case allowed by the underlying 5d structure .",
    "therefore , the ew symmetry is effectively broken by top condensation  @xcite , and the fact that the top mass is of order the ew scale ( and much larger than the other fermion masses ) is a natural consequence .",
    "the fact that the condensate involves a linear combination of rh fields leads to a version of the top seesaw  @xcite that easily accommodates the observed top mass . in this sense",
    ", the model we propose can be regarded as a uv completion for the top condensation scenario , that also leads to a novel realization of the top seesaw scheme .    in section",
    "[ sec : topseesaw ] , we also show how the ew scale and the top mass are obtained in the above model .",
    "we also present in some detail how the light fermion masses can arise from higher - dimension operators involving the top and @xmath8 fields .",
    "radion stabilization determines that the kk scale is of order several tens of @xmath11 .",
    "the low - energy spectrum includes , besides the sm fermions and gauge bosons , a ( composite ) higgs with a mass of about @xmath1 and a vector - like quark that mixes with the top quark . in section  [ sec : pheno ] , we show that the ew constraints imply that the vector - like quark mass should be in the @xmath2@xmath12 tev range . we also show that the radion field has a mass of a few gev and a `` decay constant '' of order a few hundred tev , which makes its detection challenging .",
    "the collider phenomenology of the present scenario is also briefly discussed .",
    "section  [ sec : conc ] contains our conclusions .    finally , we provide two appendices with technical discussions . in appendix",
    "[ sec : nda ] , we clarify how the strong coupling relevant to the physics of condensation is related to the strong coupling physics intrinsic to the 5d theory .",
    "we also estimate carefully the size of 4-fermion interactions that are expected to be present in the 5d theory , and that give rise , in the present scenario , to the masses of the sm fermions other than the top .",
    "we collect in appendix  [ sec : a ] several formulas that are relevant for the ew precision analysis .",
    "we start by considering the simplest toy model that displays the main features of the radion stabilization mechanism .",
    "this will allow us to understand the main idea in a simple setting .",
    "a fully realistic implementation is considered in section  [ sec : topseesaw ] .",
    "consider an @xmath13 gauge theory ( to be identified later with the color group ) in the ads@xmath14 background ds^2 = e^-2 k y _ dx^dx^- dy^2  , [ metric ] where @xmath15 runs over the 4d noncompact directions and @xmath16 .",
    "we also consider two bulk fermions , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , in the fundamental representation of @xmath13 .",
    "their boundary conditions are chosen so that one gives rise to a lh zero - mode , @xmath19 , while the other gives rise to a rh zero - mode , @xmath20 .",

    "] other operators that involve only lh or only rh fermions will play no role in the following discussion ( notice they have the `` wrong '' sign to spontaneously break the lorentz symmetry , as discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "also , in the 5d effective theory there are local 4-fermion interactions ( suppressed by the cutoff of the 5d theory , @xmath32 ) .",
    "we argue in appendix  [ sec : nda ] that the effects due to these four - fermion interactions are expected to be subdominant compared to those obtained by integrating out the gauge kk modes .",
    "the 4-fermion interaction due to gauge boson exchange , eq .",
    "( [ fourfermionops ] ) , is always attractive ( i.e. @xmath33 ) and , if sufficiently strong , can lead to a fermion - antifermion condensate  @xcite and a low - energy scalar degree of freedom  @xcite , as reviewed below .",
    "it is important to notice that one can also consider the 4-fermion interactions induced by integrating the second and higher gauge kk modes out .",
    "however , it is easy to check that the relevant couplings , analogous to eq .",
    "( [ g2original ] ) , are significantly smaller than the one associated with the first - level gauge kk mode .",
    "this can be understood from the oscillating behavior of the heavier gauge kk mode wavefunctions , which generally leads to cancellations .",
    "one can also consider the 4-fermion interactions among the _ fermion _ kk modes that arise when heavier kk gauge bosons are integrated out .",
    "but again , the associated couplings are significantly smaller than eq .",
    "( [ g2original ] ) .",
    "as will be explained in subsection  [ sec : scaleslo ] , the largest coupling [ which corresponds to eq .",
    "( [ g2original ] ) ] is only slightly above the critical value for the condensation to happen . as a result",
    "we do not expect fermion condensation in any of the above  kk channels \" .",
    "this should be contrasted to the situation in flat space , where all non - vanishing couplings among kk modes are equal , and condensation happens in all channels that exist below the cutoff of the 5d theory  @xcite .",
    "the fermion kk wavefunctions reduce to sines and cosines , a situation similar to flat space ensues . for arbitrary @xmath21-parameters",
    ", however , the condensation occurs only among the lightest fermions ( zero - modes , or ultra - light modes , as described in section  [ sec : topseesaw ] ) , due to exchange of the first - level gauge kk modes . ]",
    "therefore , we concentrate on the 4-fermion operators that involve the lightest fermions and arise from exchange of the lightest gauge kk mode .",
    "their physical effects can be studied in the 4d effective theory valid below the kk scale , and can be analyzed as in the njl model in a large @xmath6 approximation  @xcite . since our main interest is in how this well - known condensation mechanism can also stabilize the radion and how the compactification and condensation scales are related , we start by establishing the dependence of the relevant parameters on @xmath5 .",
    "both the coupling @xmath29 and the kk scale @xmath28 depend on the size of the extra dimension @xmath5 . in order to find an analytical expression for this dependence , we resort to the following trick : it is easy to obtain an analytical expression for the coefficient of the 4-fermion operator , eq .",

    "when @xmath43 , these two functions become exponentially small .",
    "the 4-dimensional effective theory can lead to a potential for the radion through the @xmath5-dependence of @xmath28 and @xmath40 , as given in the previous subsection .",

    "this covers a wide range of the expected values of @xmath460 in this scenario .",
    "specific to our model , the decay chains @xmath503 and @xmath504 would provide interesting signal topologies for the presence of the heavy quark and higgs boson , and deserve more careful studies at the lhc .",
    "we have considered the intriguing possibility that there may exist a deep connection between two of the known fundamental scales in nature : the planck and the ew scales .",
    "our framework is based on the observation that the existence of a warped extra - dimension can provide such a deep link through the _ dynamical _ determination of the ratio between the two scales . as a byproduct , a third scale ,",
    "the scale of kk resonances , is dynamically fixed in this model .",
    "the scenario we envision is as follows : there are no fundamental scalars , and the 5d version of the sm ( without a higgs ) is supplemented by a single @xmath9 singlet 5d fermion without zero - modes .",
    "the ew symmetry is broken as a consequence of top condensation , which results from the strong interactions associated with the lightest kk gluon resonance . in the low - energy theory",
    "there appears an effective higgs degree of freedom with a mass of about @xmath1 and sm - like properties .",
    "the fact that the top mass is of order the ew scale is understood as a result of the prominent role the top plays in the breaking of the ew symmetry , as in topcolor @xcite and top seesaw @xcite scenarios .",
    "our main observation is that the physics that leads to condensation automatically induces a potential that stabilizes the distance between the uv and ir branes ( described by a radion field ) .",
    "thus , the large hierarchy between the planck and ew scales is determined dynamically .",
    "interestingly , when the radion relaxes to the minimum of the potential induced by ew symmetry breaking , the kk scale is determined to be about two orders of magnitude above the ew scale .",
    "our analysis was performed in the large @xmath6 approximation , but we identified the basic ingredients behind the mechanism , which may hold beyond this approximation .",
    "additional calculable contributions to the radion potential may be suppressed in the presence of additional fermionic degrees of freedom that need not interact with the sm fields .",
    "the non - calculable contributions to the radion potential are assumed to be suppressed in a way not necessarily related to ewsb .",
    "if this is not the case , the little hierarchy between @xmath28 and @xmath66 may not survive .",
    "the prediction that the kk scale is parametrically larger than the electroweak scale allows the scenario to be consistent with ew precision constraints , since corrections due to the kk physics are appropriately suppressed . the negative contribution to the peskin - takeuchi @xmath422 parameter from the @xmath1 higgs",
    "can be compensated by the contribution from a relatively light vector - like quark that mixes with the top quark .",
    "in particular , the mass of this new fermion is expected to be between @xmath2 and @xmath12  tev , and should be observable at the lhc via single production for most of its expected range",
    ". a light radion field with a mass of order a few gev is also predicted , although its observation is expected to be challenging since it couples weakly to sm matter .",
    "summarizing , the higgs will be accessible at the lhc with a few @xmath505 or less , although it will be rather difficult to distinguish it from a sm higgs .",
    "deviations from the sm in the @xmath506 coupling of order @xmath480 , which would induce small variations in the gluon fusion higgs production and in the higgs branching fractions , will be most likely beyond the lhc sensitivity given theoretical and experimental uncertainties .",
    "this small variation could be probed at a future lepton collider .",
    "the new light vector - like fermion with mass in the @xmath507 range will require lhc integrated luminosities above @xmath508 , and would be the first direct new physics signal of this scenario beyond the sm .",
    "it is perhaps somewhat disappointing that the physics ultimately responsible for the radion stabilization mechanism ( the kk states ) lies beyond the reach of the lhc . on the other hand",
    ", the feature that the kk states are rather heavy , might be counted as a success from the point of view of ew precision tests .",
    "notice , however , that the discovery of a vector - like quark with a mass in the tev range might be taken as indication for the existence of an extra dimension that plays a role in ewsb .",
    "a @xmath1 higgs could suggest the presence of strong dynamics . our scenario would represent an example of a theory that defies the commonly held expectations that new tev - scale particles responsible for the cancellation of quadratic divergences in the higgs boson mass parameter should be present . in the model described in this paper , both the loop contributions to the higgs mass parameter and the `` bare '' higgs mass are of order the kk scale .",
    "but the dynamics of our scenario , through their radion dependence , leads to a cancellation between these two contributions , resulting in a higgs mass of order the electroweak scale .",
    "we also stress that localization of fields in the extra - dimension plays a unifying role in this scenario .",
    "the fermions that condense are the two most closely localized near the ir brane .",
    "the radion stabilization mechanism drives their 4-fermion interaction strength down , leaving it slightly above criticality and triggering condensation . on the other hand ,",
    "4-fermion couplings associated with other fermions not so close to the ir brane are reduced , generically lie below the critical value and do _ not _ lead to additional bi - fermion condensates .",
    "this makes our scenario distinct from previous extra - dimensional realizations of ewsb via fermion - anti fermion condensation  @xcite .",
    "the effective higgs degree of freedom can be thought as being localized near the ir brane , in the sense that its fermion constituents are .",
    "in addition , we showed how all fermion masses other than the top mass can arise from `` fundamental '' 4-fermion interactions .",
    "this results in a scenario where the observed fermion mass hierarchies and flavor structure can be obtained from the localization of the fermions along the extra - dimension , realizing the picture of flavor from anarchy .",
    "it is interesting that the same higher - dimensional mechanism of fermion localization can be at the heart of the physics of flavor and ewsb .",
    "we find it remarkable that this simple setup can provide rather non - trivial connections among the physics of gravity , ewsb and flavor .",

    "in the main text we analyzed the low - energy physics associated with the 4-fermion interactions that arise when the kk gluons are integrated out at tree - level . in order for the condensate to form , this coupling needs to be supercritical , hence in the strong - coupling regime .",
    "one might then wonder about the reliability of the above results , in particular as regards the radion potential . in this appendix",
    "we clarify the precise sense in which the theory is strongly coupled , and argue that the 5d uv cutoff is 10 times the curvature scale @xmath24 and is essentially independent of the fermion zero - mode localization paramter @xmath21 .",
    "we start by discussing the relation between the two scales @xmath28 and @xmath509 , and arguing that they are indeed distinct , with @xmath510 , in spite of the strong coupling that participates in the condensation mechanism .",
    "the important point to realize is that the supercritical coupling , eq .",
    "( [ g2 ] ) , is obtained by means of localizing the fermion zero - modes very close to the ir brane , not by increasing the 5d gauge coupling @xmath30 . with the gauge coupling associated with the sm strong interactions ,",
    "@xmath30 is of similar size as in standard rs scenarios with bulk fields ( or slightly smaller since one has to match to the 4d gauge coupling at a kk scale of order tens of tev , as opposed to a few tev . ) ] furthermore , the localization affects almost exclusively the fermion zero - mode .",
    "the fermion kk modes become somewhat heavier when the zero mode is localized closer to the ir brane , while their couplings are rather insensitive to the value of @xmath21 . for instance , if we concentrate on the physics at the ir brane , where couplings are largest , the kk mode wavefunctions obey @xmath511 , essentially independent of @xmath21 .",
    "recall that , in the kk picture , the large values of these wavefunctions are precisely the reason that the kk modes are more strongly coupled than the zero mode . what is happening as @xmath21 becomes more negative is that the couplings of the zero mode increase roughly like @xmath512 ,  .",
    "as @xmath513 , the coupling turns to @xmath514 . ] and can become as large as those of the kk modes .",
    "it follows that only those observables that are ir dominated , hence potentially sensitive to the fermion zero - mode , can be sensitive to the value of @xmath21 . on the contrary , observables that are uv dominated do not depend on @xmath21 .",
    "this observation will be important when estimating the unknown coefficients of various operators in the underlying 5d theory .",
    "it is instructive to understand the above statements in terms of the fermion propagator in the mixed position / momentum space representation . considering a fermion with a lh zero - mode",
    ", the propagator describing the zero - mode tower takes the form @xmath515 , where @xmath516 is the 4-momentum . the exact result for this propagator",
    "is given in eq .",
    "( 24 ) of ref .",
    ", including warp factors : @xmath517 .",
    "the mixed position / momentum space feynman rules for the vertices contain also the appropriate warp factors .",
    "for instance , for the fermion gauge interactions , one should use @xmath518 , for @xmath519 . ]",
    "when considering uv sensitive loops , only the case with @xmath520 is relevant ( non - local effects have an associated yukawa suppression that ensures they are finite ) . for illustration purposes we concentrate on the physics near the ir brane , so that @xmath521 . in this case",
    ", one finds in euclidean space , g_p(l , l ) & & = _ ^_-  , [ fermionpropagator ] where @xmath522 , and the first approximation is excellent for @xmath523 and @xmath524 , which contains the region of interest .",
    "we see , as indicated by the arrow , that as soon as @xmath516 becomes a few times larger than @xmath213 , the propagator attains its 5d behavior , which is not only independent of @xmath21 but , as expected , is also identical to the flat space result ( the warp factors simply combine to redshift the mass scales appropriately ) .",
    "thus , uv sensitive loops can be estimated as in _ flat _ space and are independent of the strong interactions associated with the zero mode when it is localized near the ir brane .    with the above understanding",
    ", we proceed to estimate the cutoff of the 5d theory .",
    "we define the scale @xmath32 as the lowest scale where an interaction gets strong , understood as the scale where the loop expansion breaks down ( adding a loop to a diagram by using the interaction in question does not lead to a suppression ) . for instance , the fermion one loop contribution to the gluon self - energy is ( -25,-19 ) & ~ & dy dy a_(q , y ) p^ a_(-q , y ) n_f g^2_5 g_p(y , y ) g_|p+q|(y,y ) + [ 0.4em ] & ~ & dy a_(q , y ) p^ a_(-q , y ) ( ^ [ g_p(y , y)]^2 )  , [ 1loopselfgluon ] where @xmath525 is the number of flavors [ in the fundamental representation of @xmath13 ] , and we used that gauge invariance requires the result to be proportional to @xmath527 . in the second line we used the fact that the propagator @xmath528 decays exponentially over distances of order @xmath529 , and that the momentum integral is dominated by @xmath530 , so that @xmath531 is required to be within @xmath532 of @xmath243 . using eq .",

    "notice that the above careful computation using the propagator ( [ fermionpropagator ] ) leads to the same result that one would have obtained in an _ uncompactified _",
    "5d theory .",

    "however , one can also write directly 4-fermion operators in the 5d theory : _ 5 ( _ i _ j ) ( _ k _ l )  , [ 5d4fermion ] where the @xmath547 s are arbitrary matrices and the indices @xmath548 run over all the fermions .",

    "the 4-fermion interaction also renormalizes the gluon self - energy considered above , e.g. ( -25,-23.5 ) & ~ & ( ) ( q^2 )  , where we indicated schematically the dependence on the external momentum required by gauge invariance . using the nda estimate for @xmath550",
    ", we see that this contribution is suppressed compared to the diagrams that do not involve the 4-fermion interaction by a factor @xmath552 , which is typically much smaller than one .",
    "we therefore see that the gauge interactions are expected to be stronger than the 4-fermion interactions and should be used to estimate the cutoff @xmath32 , as done above .",
    "it is easy to check that this picture holds at higher loop orders .",

    "however , notice that these 4-fermion operators can be included in the analysis of condensation and radion stabilization together with those induced by kk gluon exchange .",

    "<S> we propose a scenario in which the planck scale is dynamically linked to the electroweak scale induced by top condensation . </S>",
    "<S> the standard model field content , without the higgs , is promoted to a 5d warped background . </S>",
    "<S> there is also an additional 5d fermion with the quantum numbers of the right - handed top . </S>",
    "<S> localization of the zero - modes leads , at low energies , to a nambu - jona - lasinio model that also stabilizes the radion field dynamically thus explaining the hierarchy between the planck scale and @xmath0 . the top mass arises dynamically from the electroweak breaking condensate . </S>",
    "<S> the other standard model fermion masses arise naturally from higher - dimension operators , and the fermion mass hierarchies and flavor structure can be explained from the localization of the zero - modes in the extra dimension . </S>",
    "<S> if any other contributions to the radion potential except those directly related with electroweak symmetry breaking are engineered to be suppressed , the kk scale is predicted to be about two orders of magnitude above the electroweak scale rendering the model easily consistent with electroweak precision data . </S>",
    "<S> the model predicts a heavy ( composite ) higgs with a mass of about @xmath1 and standard - model - like properties , and a vector - like quark with non - negligible mixing with the top quark and mass in the @xmath2@xmath3 range . both can be within the reach of the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> it also predicts a radion with a mass of a few gev that is very weakly coupled to standard model matter . </S>"
