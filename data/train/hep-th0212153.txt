    "because of the mass gap , the correlation function is suppressed exponentially in p - space .",
    "it is very familiar that a mass gap leads to an exponential fall off in x - space , but here for the dual lattice the exponential fall off is in momentum space .",
    "this may be traced to the t - duality of the closed strings and the resultant interchange of the ir / uv limits .",
    "thus the two point function of the original fields ( by dividing with the @xmath137 normalisations factor ) , goes as an exponential for large momentum @xmath138 , and as a polynomial for low momenta .",
    "the observed small value @xmath139 in natural units has an explanation in the toroidal cosmology of closed strings and thus the dark energy provides an exciting opportunity to connect string theory to precision cosmology .",
    "we may argue that numerically the size of the cosmological constant in the present approach is a combination of the string scale and the hubble expansion rate in the sense that @xmath140 .",
    "therefore the correct amount of dark energy obtained by this frequency dispersion function does not require any fine tuning and relies , besides a physical mechanism ( such as freeze - out ) , only on the string scale as the parameter of the theory .",
    "nonlinearity of short distance physics and the breaking of lorentz invariance results in a violation of bianchi identity for transplanckian models .",

    ", we therefore use a kinetic theory approach for modifying einstein equations in the absence of an effective lagrangian description .",
    "the assumption made is that a kinetic theory description of the cosmological fluid is valid even in the transplanckian regime . despite its nonlinear behavior at short distances , this imperfect fluid shares the same symmetries , namely homogeneity and isotropy , as the background frw universe .",
