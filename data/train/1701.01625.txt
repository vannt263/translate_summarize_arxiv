    "interference management has been taken into account as one of the most challenging issues to increase the throughput of cellular networks serving multiple users . in multiuser cellular environments ,",
    "each receiver may suffer from intra - cell and inter - cell interference .",
    "interference alignment ( ia ) was proposed by fundamentally solving the interference problem when there are multiple communication pairs  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the ia scheme can achieve the optimal degrees - of - freedom ( dof ) in the multiuser interference channel with time - varying channel coefficients .",
    "subsequent studies have shown that the ia is also useful and indeed achieves the optimal dof in various wireless multiuser network setups : multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) interference channels  @xcite and cellular networks  @xcite .",
    "in particular , ia techniques  @xcite for cellular uplink and downlink networks , also known as the interfering multiple - access channel ( imac ) or interfering broadcast channel ( ibc ) , respectively , have received much attention .",
    "the existing ia framework for cellular networks , however , still has several practical challenges : the scheme proposed in  @xcite requires arbitrarily large frequency / time - domain dimension extension , and the scheme proposed in  @xcite is based on iterative optimization of processing matrices and can not be optimally extended to an arbitrary downlink cellular network in terms of achievable dof . in the literature , there are some results on the usefulness of fading in single - cell downlink broadcast channels , where one can obtain multiuser diversity gain along with user scheduling as the number of users is sufficiently large : opportunistic scheduling  @xcite , opportunistic beamforming  @xcite , and random beamforming  @xcite .",
    "scenarios exploiting multiuser diversity gain have been studied also in ad hoc networks  @xcite , cognitive radio networks  @xcite , and cellular networks  @xcite .",
    "recently , the concept of opportunistic ia  ( oia ) was introduced in  @xcite for the @xmath2-cell uplink network ( i , e .",
    ", imac model ) , where there are one @xmath3-antenna base station ( bs ) and @xmath1 users in each cell .",
    "the oia scheme incorporates user scheduling into the classical ia framework by opportunistically selecting @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) users amongst the @xmath1 users in each cell in the sense that inter - cell interference is aligned at a pre - defined interference space .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that one can asymptotically achieve the optimal dof if the number of users in a cell scales as a certain function of the signal - to - noise - ratio ( snr ) . for the @xmath2-cell downlink network ( i.e. , ibc model ) assuming one @xmath3-antenna base station ( bs ) and @xmath1 per - cell users , studies on the oia have been conducted in  @xcite .",
    "more specifically , the user scaling condition for obtaining the optimal dof was characterized for the @xmath2-cell multiple - input single - output ( miso ) ibc  @xcite , and then such an analysis of the dof achievability was extended to the @xmath2-cell mimo ibc with @xmath6 receive antennas at each user  @xcite  full dof can be achieved asymptotically , provided that @xmath1 scales faster than @xmath7 , for the @xmath2-cell mimo ibc using oia  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose an _ opportunistic downlink ia ( odia ) _ framework as a promising interference management technique for @xmath2-cell downlink networks , where each cell consists of one bs with @xmath3 antennas and @xmath1 users having @xmath6 antennas each .",
    "the proposed odia jointly takes into account user scheduling and downlink ia issues .",
    "in particular , inspired by the precoder design in  @xcite , we use two cascaded beamforming matrices to construct our precoder at each bs . to design the first transmit beamforming matrix",
    ", we use a user - specific beamforming , which conducts a linear zero - forcing ( zf ) filtering and thus eliminates intra - cell interference among spatial streams in the same cell . to design the second transmit beamforming matrix",
    ", we use a predetermined reference beamforming matrix , which plays the same role of random beamforming for cellular downlink  @xcite and thus efficiently reduces the effect of inter - cell interference from other - cell bss . on the other hand ,",
    "the receive beamforming vector is designed at each user in the sense of minimizing the total amount of received inter - cell interference using _ local _ channel state information ( csi ) in a decentralized manner .",
    "each user feeds back both the effective channel vector and the quantity of received inter - cell interference to its home - cell bs . the user selection and",
    "transmit beamforming at the bss and the design of receive beamforming at the users are completely decoupled .",
    "hence , the odia operates in a non - collaborative manner while requiring no information exchange among bss and no iterative optimization between transmitters and receivers , thereby resulting in an easier implementation .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is four - fold as follows .",
    "* we first show that the minimum number of users required to achieve @xmath4 dof ( @xmath5 ) can be fundamentally reduced to @xmath8 by using the odia at the expense of acquiring perfect csi at the bss from users , compared to the existing downlink ia schemes requiring the user scaling law @xmath9  @xcite , implies that @xmath10 . ] where @xmath4 denotes the number of spatial streams per cell .",
    "the interference decaying rate with respect to @xmath1 for given snr is also characterized in regards to the derived user scaling law .",
    "* we introduce a limited feedback strategy in the odia framework , and then analyze the required number of feedback bits leading to the same dof performance as that of the odia assuming perfect feedback , which is given by @xmath11 .",
    "* we present a user scheduling method for the odia to achieve optimal multiuser diversity gain , i.e. , @xmath12 per stream even in the presence of downlink inter - cell interference . * to verify the odia schemes , we perform numerical evaluation via computer simulations .",
    "simulation results show that the proposed odia significantly outperforms existing interference management and user scheduling techniques in terms of sum - rate in realistic cellular environments .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",

    "we consider a @xmath2-cell mimo ibc where each cell consists of a bs with @xmath3 antennas and @xmath1 users with @xmath6 antennas each . the number of selected users in each cell is denoted by @xmath13 .",
    "it is assumed that each selected user receives a single spatial stream . to consider nontrivial cases , we assume that @xmath14 , because all inter - cell interference can be completely canceled at the receivers ( i.e. , users ) otherwise .",
    "moreover , the number of antennas at the users is in general limited due to the size of the form factor , and hence it is more safe to assume that @xmath6 is relatively small compared to @xmath15 .",
    "the channel matrix from the @xmath16-th bs to the @xmath17-th user in the @xmath18-th cell is denoted by @xmath19}\\in \\mathbb{c}^{l \\times m}$ ] , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "each element of @xmath22}$ ] is assumed to be independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) according to @xmath23 .",
    "in addition , quasi - static frequency - flat fading is assumed , i.e. , channel coefficients are constant during one transmission block and change to new independent values for every transmission block .",
    "the @xmath17-th user in the @xmath18-th cell can estimate the channels @xmath19}$ ] , @xmath24 , using pilot signals sent from all the bss .",
    "the received signal vector at the @xmath17-th user in the @xmath18-th cell is expressed as : @xmath25 } & = \\sum_{k=1}^{k}\\mathbf{h}_{k}^{[i , j ] } \\mathbf{s}_k+   \\mathbf{z}^{[i , j]},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the transmit signal vector at the @xmath16-th bs with unit average power , i.e. , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 } \\in \\mathbb{c}^{l \\times 1}$ ] denotes additive noise , each element of which is independent and identically distributed complex gaussian with zero mean and the variance of @xmath29 . the average snr is given by @xmath30}\\mathbf{s}_i \\right\\|^2 \\right]}/{\\mathbb{e}\\left [ \\left\\| \\mathbf{z}^{[i , j]}\\right\\|^2 \\right ] } = { 1}/{n_0}$ ] .",
    "thus , in what follows we shall use the notation @xmath31 for notational simplicity .",

    "we first describe the overall procedure of our proposed odia scheme for the mimo ibc , and then define its achievable sum - rate and dof .",
    "the odia scheme is described according to the following four steps .",
    "the reference beamforming matrix at the bs in the @xmath16-th cell is given by @xmath37 $ ] , where @xmath38 is an for @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "if the reference beamforming matrix is generated in a pseudo - random fashion , i.e. , it changes based on a certain pattern as if it changes randomly and the pattern is known by the bss as well as the users , bss do not need to broadcast them to users .",
    "then , the @xmath17-th user in the @xmath18-th cell obtains @xmath41}_{k}$ ] and @xmath42 , @xmath24 .      in the second step ,",
    "we explain how to decide a user scheduling metric at each user along with given receive beamforming , where the design of receive beamforming will be explained in section  [ sec : achievability ] . let @xmath43 } \\in",

    "note that the user - specific beamforming @xmath45 will be utilized only to cancel intra - cell interference out , and the inter - cell interference will be suppressed from user scheduling , which will be specified later .",
    "thus , from the notion of @xmath42 and @xmath41}_{k}$ ] , the @xmath17-th user in the @xmath18-th cell can compute the following quantity while using its receive beamforming vector @xmath43}$ ] , which is given by @xmath46}_{k } & = \\left\\| { \\mathbf{u}^{[i , j]}}^{\\mathsf{h}}\\mathbf{h}_{k}^{[i , j ] } \\mathbf{p}_k \\right\\|^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 . using ( [ eq : eta_tilde ] ) , the scheduling metric at the @xmath17-th user in the @xmath18-th cell , denoted by @xmath50}$ ] , is defined as the sum of @xmath51}_{k}$ ] .",

    "[ fig : system_model ] , each user feeds the metric in ( [ eq : eta ] ) back to its home - cell bs .",
    "in addition to the scheduling metric in ( [ eq : eta ] ) , for each bs to design the user - specific beamforming @xmath45 , each user needs to feed back the information of the following vector @xmath53 } \\triangleq \\left({\\mathbf{u}^{[i , j]}}^{\\mathsf{h } } \\mathbf{h}^{[i , j]}_i \\mathbf{p } _",

    "in addition , we shall show in the sequel that the inter - cell interference can be successfully suppressed by using the metric @xmath50}_{k}$ ] even with @xmath45 excluded and that the optimal dof can be achieved .",
    "at this point , it is worthwhile to note that the role of @xmath42 is two - fold .",
    "first , it determines the dimension of the effective received channel according to given parameter @xmath4 . by multiplying @xmath42 to the channel matrix , the dimension of the effective channel",
    "is reduced to @xmath4 rather than @xmath3 , which results in reduced number of inter - cell interference terms as well as reduced average interference level for each interference term .",
    "we shall show in the sequel that @xmath42 plays a role in the end of rendering the user scaling law dependent on the parameter @xmath4 .",
    "second , @xmath42 separates the user scheduling procedure from the user - specific precoding matrix design of @xmath45 and also from the receiver beamforming vector design of @xmath55 . by employing the cascaded precoding matrix design ,",
    "the scheduling metric in ( 1 ) becomes independent of @xmath45 or @xmath55 , and @xmath55 can be obtained as a function of only @xmath22}$ ] and @xmath42 as shown in ( [ eq : u_design ] ) .",
    "the reason why @xmath42 is designed to change in a pseudo - random fashion is to increase the fairness of the users scheduling by randomizing the scheduling metric of each user , but can also be fixed if the fairness is not a matter or the channel changes fast enough .",
    "in addition , if one wants to further improve the achievable rate , @xmath42 may be channel - specifically designed combined with the user scheduling , which however results in a collaborative and iterative user scheduling and precoding matrix design .    in this and",
    "subsequent sections , we focus on how to simply design a user scheduling method to guarantee the optimal dof .",
    "an enhanced scheduling algorithm jointly taking into account the vector to be fed back in ( [ eq : effective_ch ] ) and the scheduling metric in ( [ eq : eta ] ) may provide a better performance in terms of sum - rate , which shall be discussed in section [ sec : threhold_odia ] .      as illustrated in fig .",

    "<S> in this paper , we propose an opportunistic downlink interference alignment ( odia ) for interference - limited cellular downlink , which intelligently combines user scheduling and downlink ia techniques . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed odia not only efficiently reduces the effect of inter - cell interference from other - cell base stations ( bss ) but also eliminates intra - cell interference among spatial streams in the same cell . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the minimum number of users required to achieve a target degrees - of - freedom ( dof ) can be fundamentally reduced , i.e. , the fundamental user scaling law can be improved by using the odia , compared with the existing downlink ia schemes . in addition , we adopt a limited feedback strategy in the odia framework , and then analyze the number of feedback bits required for the system with limited feedback to achieve the same user scaling law of the odia as the system with perfect csi . </S>",
    "<S> we also modify the original odia in order to further improve sum - rate , which achieves the optimal multiuser diversity gain , i.e. , @xmath0 , per spatial stream even in the presence of downlink inter - cell interference , where @xmath1 denotes the number of users in a cell . </S>",
    "<S> simulation results show that the odia significantly outperforms existing interference management techniques in terms of sum - rate in realistic cellular environments . </S>",
    "<S> note that the odia operates in a non - collaborative and decoupled manner , i.e. , it requires no information exchange among bss and no iterative beamformer optimization between bss and users , thus leading to an easier implementation .    inter - cell interference , interference alignment , degrees - of - freedom ( dof ) , transmit & receive beamforming , limited feedback , multiuser diversity , user scheduling . </S>"
