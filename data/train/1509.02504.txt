    "the description of an electric charge in hyperbolic motion is at the center of minkowski s geometrical formulation of electrodynamics . in `` space and time ''",
    "@xcite , his last contribution to special relativity before his premature death , minkowski gives a brief geometrical recipe for calculating the four - force with which an electric charge acts upon another electric charge .",
    "we can get a better appreciation of minkowski s revolutionary work by exploring his geometrical recipe , by assembling the derivation details that minkowski did not have a chance to publish .",
    "the first step in minkowski s procedure is to approximate the motion of the source charge with hyperbolic motion .",
    "this is done with the help of three infinitesimally close points on the worldline of the source particle .",
    "this hyperbola of curvature , tangent to the worldline , is determined by the four - velocity and the four - acceleration of the particle at the given spacetime point @xmath0 . the hyperbola lies in the plane defined by these two four - vectors .",
    "the four - acceleration , which is perpendicular to the four - velocity , lies on a line that goes through the center of the hyperbola @xmath1 .",
    "minkowski mentions that the length @xmath2 of the segment mp determines the magnitude of the four - acceleration , according to the formula @xmath3 .",
    "the second step in minkowski s procedure is to complete the spacetime diagram with the inclusion of the test charge . from the worldpoint @xmath0 ,",
    "where the source particle is , we draw into the future a lightcone that intersects the worldline of the test particle at point @xmath4 .",
    "minkowski uses a reference frame which is instantaneously at rest with the source particle at @xmath0 . in this co - moving reference frame the time axis",
    "@xmath5 has the direction of the four - velocity , which is tangent to the worldline .",
    "the distance @xmath6 between the test charge and the source charge , at the retarded position , is the length of a segment @xmath7 perpendicular to the time axis @xmath5 . in the co - moving reference frame the four - potential",
    ", being parallel to the four - velocity of the source particle , has an especially simple expression .",
    "minkowski mentions that the four - potential at worldpoint @xmath4 has the direction of @xmath8 and the magnitude of @xmath9 ( in gaussian units ) , where @xmath10 is the electric charge of the source .",
    "the third step in minkowski s procedure is to establish the spatial axes of the co - moving reference frame .",
    "the origin of the reference system is at @xmath0 , the retarded position of the source charge .",
    "the @xmath11 axis is parallel to the radial segment @xmath12 , previously determined .",
    "the @xmath13 axis is chosen in such a way to make sure that the hyperbola of curvature ( the plane @xmath14 ) and the field point @xmath4 are included in the three dimensional subspace spanned by the @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath5 axes .",
    "the @xmath13 axis is parallel to the segment @xmath17 , which is drawn from @xmath1 , the center of the hyperbola , perpendicular to the @xmath15 axis .",
    "it turns out that the segment @xmath17 is not only perpendicular to the @xmath15 axis , but also perpendicular to the @xmath5 axis , which makes it eligible to indicate the direction of the @xmath13 axis .",
    "( the proof that @xmath18 goes like this : @xmath19 because the four - velocity is perpendicular to the four - acceleration .",
    "@xmath20 because @xmath21 and @xmath22 . as a result @xmath23 , which means that @xmath24 . ) the @xmath25 axis is automatically determined from its orthogonality to the @xmath11 , @xmath13 , and @xmath26 axes .    in the final step minkowski",
    "writes down an expression for the four - force with which the particle at @xmath0 ( with electric charge @xmath10 ) , acts upon the particle at @xmath4 ( with electric charge @xmath27 ) .",
    "the electrodynamic four - force ( in gaussian units ) is :    @xmath28    where the dots represent derivation with respect to the proper time .",
    "the components of the four - vector @xmath29 satisfy the relations : @xmath30 while , at the same time , the four - vector @xmath29 is orthogonal to the four - velocity of the test particle at @xmath4 .",
    "we also notice that in minkowski space @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "it turns out that , in order to fully understand the geometrical recipe of minkowski , one first has to derive an expression of the electromagnetic field produced by the source charge .",
    "this is a step that minkowski has probably intentionally left out .",
    "born @xcite is the first one to publish a calculation of the electromagnetic field produced by an electric charge distribution in hyperbolic motion .",
    "he uses these results in his discussion of the stability of the rigid electron .",
    "sommerfeld @xcite soon realizes that , for all practical purposes , an electron acts just like a point particle , and gives a detailed derivation of the electromagnetic field produced by a point charge in hyperbolic motion .",
    "laue @xcite reproduces sommerfeld s derivation in his book , giving even more mathematical details .",
    "unfortunately , laue fails to follow up with a similar calculation of the electrodynamic four - force .",
    "one decade later the derivation of the electromagnetic field of a point charge in hyperbolic motion briefly resurfaces in pauli s @xcite book .    with the exception of sommerfeld @xcite , who mentions that his own calculation of the electrodynamic four - force is in agreement with the geometric rule given by minkowski ,",
    "the early special relativity authors have completely ignored minkowski s geometrical description of the interaction between two electrically charged particles . as an example",
    ", even pauli @xcite fails to mention that his algebraic derivation of the electrodynamic four - force reproduces minkowski s expression in all the details .",
    "this important validation of minkowski s geometrical approach did not escape walter @xcite , who mentions it , still without proof , in footnote ( 111 ) of a recent essay .",
    "we want to bring to light all the derivation details behind the results of minkowski , sommerfeld , and pauli , and to present the early history of hyperbolic motion in a comprehensive and fully accessible manner .",
    "a point in minkowski space is described by a position four - vector @xmath33 . consider a particle in hyperbolic motion , moving along the @xmath11 axis , as shown in figure [ fig : hyperbola ] .",
    "the center of the hyperbola @xmath34 is taken as the origin of the reference frame . if the length of the segment @xmath35 is @xmath36 , and if the angle between this segment and the @xmath37 axis is @xmath38 , then a point @xmath39 on the worldline of the particle will have coordinates @xmath40 .",
    "the arc length @xmath41 on the hyperbola is given by @xmath42 .",
    "the infinitesimal arc length is related to the proper time of the particle by @xmath43 .",
    "the particle at @xmath39 will have a four - velocity @xmath44 and a four - acceleration @xmath45 .",
    "the magnitudes of these four - vectors are @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "the reference frame in which the particle at q is instantaneously at rest ( the four - velocity is parallel to the time axis ) comes from a rotation of the original axes by an angle @xmath38 : @xmath49 a_u'\\end{pmatrix } =   \\begin{pmatrix}\\cos(\\psi ) & \\sin(\\psi ) \\\\[0.3em ]   -\\sin(\\psi ) \\text {   } & \\cos(\\psi)\\end{pmatrix } \\begin{pmatrix}\\frac{c^2}{a } \\cos(\\psi ) \\\\[0.3em ] \\frac{c^2}{a } \\sin(\\psi)\\end{pmatrix } =   \\begin{pmatrix}\\frac{c^2}{a } \\\\[0.3em ] 0\\end{pmatrix}. \\label{eq : rotation}\\ ] ]    in the co - moving reference frame the acceleration experienced by the particle is always equal to @xmath50 .",

    "synge @xcite has shown that if the retarded and advanced potentials have equal weights , and if the magnitudes of the acceleration of the source charge at the retarded and advanced positions are the same , then the electric charge does not radiate energy .",
    "while synge discusses the case of a particle in uniform circular motion , the same conclusion applies to a particle in hyperbolic motion .",
    "this is a very significant result , because whether an electric charge in hyperbolic motion does or does not radiate energy is the subject of a long scientific controversy @xcite .",
    "pauli @xcite predicts no radiation , based on the nul magnetic field ( poynting vector ) .",
    "feynman @xcite also predicts no radiation , based on the principle of equivalence of general relativity .",

    "lamont @xcite has experienced a similar insight , for he talks about the `` infinitesimal thickness '' of the lightcone of the source charge and `` how much proper time the [ test ] charge spends in this region '' .",
    "consider two points , @xmath215 ( on the source particle worldline ) and @xmath216 ( on the test particle worldline ) connected by a light signal .",
    "consider two other points infinitely close to the first two points , @xmath217 ( on the source particle worldline ) and @xmath218 ( on the test particle worldline ) , also connected by a light signal . since @xmath219 , @xmath220 , @xmath221 , @xmath222 , to first order in the infinitesimals the ratio of the two infinitesimal segments connected by light signals at both ends is @xcite : @xmath223        the coulombian interaction between point charges @xmath39 and @xmath201 is now replaced with the coulombian interaction between segments of length @xmath227 and @xmath228 on worldlines with constant linear charge densities . as a result the electric force @xmath229 acting on the test charge is replaced with a four - force @xmath230 that depends on the velocity of the test particle .",

    "adding these two contributions together one obtains @xmath244 .",
    "the sign is incorrect , and we have to simply change it by an _ ad hoc _ rule .",
    "we hope that future research will elucidate this circumstance .",
    "one could also argue that , in the case of motion with variable acceleration , the four - force obtained from our model is not orthogonal to the four - velocity .",
    "a small deviation from orthogonality could indeed exist , and our geometrical recipe in this case amounts to supplementing the antisymmetric electromagnetic field tensor @xmath245 with a small ( possibly symmetric ) tensor @xmath246 .",
    "we expect the contribution of @xmath246 to average out to zero . in any case",
    ", by requiring that the rest mass of an electron does not depend on its history , and by using stoke s theorem , one obtains the two homogeneous maxwell equations @xcite .",
    "other relations could also be imposed upon @xmath245 and @xmath246 .",
    "roscoe @xcite , using the orthogonality between certain linear operator spaces , reaches the same conclusion , that the lorentz four - force needs more than the antisymmetric electromagnetic field tensor , and identifies the additional @xmath246 tensor with a massive photon .",
    "the condition that roscoe imposes , the restoration of the non - relativistic action and reaction principle , is probably at odds with the non interaction theorem .",
    "more research is needed to determine the exact physical properties of the @xmath246 tensor .",
    "we will conclude this article with another interesting observation .",
    "was minkowski himself on the verge of discovering the possibility of replacing the interacting material point particles with infinitesimal length elements along their worldlines ?",
