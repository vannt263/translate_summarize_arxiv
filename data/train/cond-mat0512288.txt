    "several recent papers@xcite report on a correlation between the low - temperature thermopower @xmath0 and the specific heat coefficient @xmath1 for heavy fermions and valence fluctuating compounds with ce , eu , yb and u ions .",
    "the data show that the zero - temperature limit of the ratio @xmath10 in most systems is about the same , although the absolute values of @xmath11 and @xmath12 vary by orders of magnitude @xcite . at the moment",
    "it is not clear if the deviations from universality arise because of insufficient accuracy of the data , or because the ` universal law ' is only approximately valid .",
    "the difficulty is that neither @xmath9 nor @xmath13 are linear in the lowest available temperature intervals and to obtain the linear coefficients one has to estimate the functional form of @xmath9 and @xmath13 before taking the zero - temperature limit .",
    "the temperature dependences of @xmath9 and @xmath13 in various systems might have a different physical origin , and comparing the data on @xmath14 without a detailed knowledge of the underlying dynamics might lead to erroneous conclusions .",
    "furthermore , the definition of the ` zero - temperature limit ' can differ considerably for systems with vastly different characteristic temperatures and at present it is not clear what the error bars are for the @xmath3 data .",
    "we believe , the universality of the @xmath3 ratio could be tested most directly by performing a pressure experiment which transforms ce- or eu - based heavy fermion materials into valence fluctuators , and yb - based valence fluctuators into heavy fermion materials .",
    "pressure can not only change the characteristic temperature of a given compound by several orders of magnitude@xcite and , with that , change the nature of the ground state , but it has a dramatic effect on the overall shape of the thermopower .",
    "although the low - temperature pressure experiments are less accurate than the ambient pressure ones , the evolution of @xmath9 or @xmath13 with pressure could be followed and the universality of @xmath3 studied in a systematic way .",
    "experiments which provide the low - temperature thermopower and the specific heat on the same sample at various pressures are yet to be performed but some data are available on the doping dependence ( chemical pressure ) of @xmath0 and @xmath11 .",
    "for example , doping alters @xmath0 and @xmath11 of eucu@xmath4(ge@xmath5si@xmath6)@xmath4 , cept@xmath5ni@xmath6 and ybin@xmath5ag@xmath7cu@xmath8 intermetallics by more than one order of magnitude @xcite . while barely affecting the low - temperature ratio @xmath3 .",
    "we explain this behavior as a chemical pressure effect .",
    "a simple relation between @xmath0 and @xmath15 is obtained for a free electron gas and for non - interacting electrons on a lattice .",
    "the solution of the boltzmann equation gives , under fairly general conditions , the result @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the entropy density , @xmath18 the number density of the charge carriers and the second equality holds because the specific heat is linear with @xmath19 at low @xmath19 .",
    "but non - interacting electrons fail to describe the properties of the compounds mentioned above and the question arises to what extent does the ` universal relation ' between @xmath0 and @xmath17 ( or @xmath20 ) hold for strongly correlated electrons ?    on a macroscopic level , an analysis of the charge and heat transport of a thermoelectric in terms of transport equations yields the same relationship between @xmath0 and @xmath2 as the free electron model .",
    "this derivation assumes that under isothermal conditions the expectation value of the charge current density is proportional to the expectation value of the heat current density , and we expect it to be valid for fermi liquids ( fl ) ; of course , this is neglecting other sources of heat transport , such as phonon contributions ( but those do not enter into isothermal heat transport unless there are phonon drag effects ) . in the case of the non - fl compounds , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are temperature - dependent , instead of @xmath23 one",
    "should consider the ratio @xmath24 .",
    "the zero - temperature @xmath3-ratio has been discussed recently by miyake and kohno@xcite .",
    "they calculate the dynamical conductivity of the periodic anderson model in the quasiparticle ( qp ) approximation and obtain the seebeck coefficient from the canonical formula which expresses @xmath9 as the ratio of two transport integrals@xcite .",
    "the universal fl behavior is derived by assuming that in addition to the renormalization effects due to the coulomb interaction between _",
    "f_-electrons , the charge and heat transport are affected by the scattering of quasiparticles off residual impurities .",
    "this scattering dominates the transport relaxation time and gives rise to a finite residual resistivity @xmath25 . in the dilute limit",
    ", the impurity concentration drops out of the ratio of transport integrals and does not appear in the expression for the seebeck coefficient .",
    "the exact many - body transport coefficients of the periodic spin-1/2 anderson model have recently been obtained at finite temperatures by grenzebach et al.@xcite using the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) which maps the lattice problem onto an auxiliary single impurity model with a self consistency condition .",
    "the electron relaxation is solely due to the coulomb repulsion between _ f_-electrons and the model describes both heavy fermions and valence fluctuators with vanishing @xmath25 .",
    "the solution of the auxiliary impurity problem is obtained by the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) method , which provides accurate results for the static properties at arbitrary temperature and for the dynamical properties above the fl regime . however ,",
    "the zero - temperature limit of the transport relaxation time is difficult to obtain by the dmft+nrg method ( due to numerical issues associated with the self - consistency ) , and the validity of the fl laws for the transport coefficients of strongly correlated electrons has not been clearly established .    in this contribution , we discuss the zero - temperature @xmath3-ratio for the periodic anderson model and the falicov - kimball model , which describe heavy fermions and valence fluctuators with crystal field ( cf ) split 4_f_-states . in this limit",
    "the excited cf states are not occupied and we calculate the slope of @xmath9 using the dmft solution of an effective @xmath26-fold degenerate model .",
    "the result agrees with that of miyake and kohno@xcite even though we consider a periodic model with vanishing @xmath25 and have a positive coefficient for the @xmath27 term of the electrical resistance .",
    "we also analyze the influence of cf splittings on the thermopower of the anderson model above the fl regime . at present , the dynamical properties of such a model can not be obtained by the exact dmft mapping and we find the solution using an approximate ` poor man s mapping ' .",
    "that is , we assume that the conduction electrons scatter incoherently off the 4_f_-ions , relate the transport relaxation time to the single - ion t - matrix , and solve the scattering problem by the non - crossing approximation ( nca ) , which can properly treat the highly asymmetric limit of the anderson model and infinite coulomb repulsion .",
    "the results obtained in such a way explain the concentration ( chemical pressure ) dependence of @xmath28 and the evolution of @xmath9 in eucu@xmath4(ge@xmath5si@xmath6)@xmath4@xcite cept@xmath5ni@xmath6@xcite , and ybin@xmath5ag@xmath7cu@xmath8@xcite .",
    "the thermoelectric properties of these systems exhibit all the typical features observed in heavy fermions and valence fluctuators@xcite .",
    "our calculations show that the temperature dependence of @xmath9 at each doping level is consistent with the character of the ground state inferred from the initial thermopower slope .",
    "the rest of this contribution is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the macroscopic transport equations , discuss the seebeck and peltier experiments , and find the relationship between the thermopower and the entropy . in section",

    "our conclusions are presented in section v.",
    "we consider the macroscopic charge and energy currents which are given by the statistical averages @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the density matrix , @xmath32 the charge current density and @xmath33 the energy current density operators for a system of charged particles in the presence of an external scalar potential @xmath34 .",
    "these operators are are obtained by commuting the hamiltonian with the charge and energy polarization operators@xcite respectively , which are chosen in such a way that the macroscopic currents satisfy the appropriate continuity equations@xcite .",
    "assuming that the external potential couples to the charge density , a direct calculation shows@xcite that @xmath32 is field independent and @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the energy current density defined by the field - free hamiltonian .",
    "the macroscopic energy current @xmath37 does not satisfy the continuity equation in the presence of the external potential but is easily calculated by a perturbative expansion .",

    "in what follows , we assume a homogenous and isotropic conductor in the absence of a magnetic field and consider only a single cartesian component of @xmath32 and @xmath52 ( this is appropriate for cubic systems ) .",

    "the solution of eqs .",
    " , with appropriate boundary conditions , completely specifies the thermoelectric response of the system .",
    "the above procedure connects the theoretical model of a given material with the phenomenological transport coefficients and could be used , in principle , to explain the experimentally established relationship between the thermopower and the specific heat .",
    "however , for general many body systems such a program can not be completed and , at first sight , it is not obvious that the transport coefficients , which depend on the dynamical properties of the system , are simply related to the thermodynamic quantities , which depend only on the static properties@xcite .",
    "for example , the heat current considered in this many - body theory is just the electronic contribution to the heat transport , hence we only expect it to relate to the appropriate electronic contributions to the entropy . on a macroscopic level , the relationship between @xmath0 and @xmath2 can be obtained by solving eqs .",

    "the seebeck voltage appears because the charged particles diffuse from the hot to the cold end and the imbalance of charge gives rise to a potential gradient across the sample .",

    "( [ alpha - s ] ) or @xmath109 in eq .",
    "is not the full entropy @xmath110 of the system , but only the entropy of the charge carriers appearing in the transport equations .",

    "but @xmath17 has different vertex corrections and the specific heat is not affected by these cancellations . similarly ,",

    "the calculated thermopower@xcite is of the order of a few @xmath559 , and its sign is either positive or negative , depending on the band filling and the shape of the conduction band .",
    "the proximity of @xmath42 to the pseudogap would lead ( in a non - interacting system ) to a shallow minimum of @xmath9 at a temperature of the order of @xmath427 , but in an interacting system , the valence - change transition destabilizes the semiconducting phase , and gives rise to a discontinuity of @xmath9 at @xmath425 .",

    "the large reduction of the @xmath563 ratio at @xmath425 is an indication of the reduction of fermi volume .",
    "in this contribution , we have discussed recent experiments which report an universal ratio of the low - temperature thermopower and specific heat of heavy fermion and valence fluctuating intermetallic compounds with ce , eu , and yb ions @xcite .",
    "the data analysis has shown@xcite that systems with very different values of @xmath535 and @xmath11 often have similar values of the low - temperature ratio @xmath564 . here , we considered in some detail the chemical pressure data on eucu@xmath4(ge@xmath5si@xmath6)@xmath4 , cept@xmath5ni@xmath6 , and ybin@xmath5ag@xmath7cu@xmath8 intermetallics , in which the character of the ground state is concentration dependent and @xmath535 and @xmath11 change by an order of magnitude , while @xmath454 shows only small , but systematic , deviations from universality .",

    "we have discussed various possible sources for the non - universal behavior and pointed out the difficulties which have to be taken into account when comparing the experimental and theoretical results for systems which are close to a phase boundary .",
    "we have then analyzed the low - temperature behavior of the periodic anderson and the falicov - kimball models using the dmft approach and found the universal ratio @xmath565 .",
    "we have discussed two possible routes which the system can follow to remove the entropy of the paramagnetic states at low temperatures and showed that the ratio of the thermopower and the entropy , @xmath563 , tracks the fermi volume of the charge carrying states .",

    "a weak concentration dependence of @xmath568 is most likely due to the transfer of the charge from the _",

    "the cept@xmath5ni@xmath6 data also show a slight doping dependence but the onset of the ferromagnetic transition precludes a quantitative analysis .",
    "the calculations for correlated insulators , described by the falicov - kimball model , show that @xmath569 can assume very large values at low temperature .",
    "we have also shown , using the poor man s mapping which approximates the periodic lattice of 4_f _ ions by the single impurity anderson model , that the temperature dependence of @xmath9 in eucu@xmath4(ge@xmath5si@xmath6)@xmath4 , cept@xmath5ni@xmath6 and ybin@xmath5ag@xmath7cu@xmath8@xcite is consistent with the character of the ground state at each doping level .",
    "the behavior of @xmath9 calculated by the nca for @xmath330 captures the main features of pressure and doping experiments on heavy fermions and valence fluctuators .",
    "since @xmath9 does not show much structure for @xmath570 , the overall temperature dependence of @xmath9 is easily obtained , interpolating between the fl and the nca results .",
    "our calculations explain the drastic doping - induced variation of @xmath9 observed in many intermetallic compounds with ce , yb and eu ions .",
    "they also explain the pressure - induced crossover from a kondo system with small kondo temperature due to cf splitting to a kondo system with large kondo temperature , and eventually to a valence fluctuator , as observed in the resistivity@xcite and thermopower data@xcite on cecu@xmath4ru@xmath4 .",
    "the double - peak structure of @xmath9 observed in heavy fermions ( or the single - peak in valence fluctuators ) is reproduced well by the nca results for the single - ion anderson model with ( or without ) cf splitting , as shown schematically in figs .",
    "[ fig : tep_eu ] and [ fig : tep ] .    in the case of random alloys described by the single impurity anderson model ,",
    "the zero - temperature limit of @xmath565 is given by the expression in eq .   which differs by @xmath571 from the corresponding expression in eq .",
    "for the anderson lattice .",
    "the impurity result applies to random alloys obtained by the substitutional doping of the rare earth sites , like ce@xmath5la@xmath6b@xmath572@xcite , ce@xmath5y@xmath6cu@xmath4si@xmath4@xcite , ce@xmath5la@xmath6cu@xmath4si@xmath4@xcite , yb@xmath5y@xmath6incu@xmath8@xcite and similar systems .",
    "it might also apply to ternary and quaternary systems with one rare earth ion per unit cell but a short mean free path .",
    "if the effective degeneracy of the _ f_-state is changed in random alloys by chemical pressure or pressure , the factor @xmath571 should lead to observable modifications of the @xmath314-ratio .",
    "however , the experimental verification is complicated by the fact that the magnetic and non - magnetic contributions to @xmath9 and @xmath13 are often difficult to separate .    in summary ,",
    "our results show that the thermopower is a sensitive probe of the low - energy excitations and that the seemingly complicated behavior of @xmath9 can be explained in simple terms .",
    "it is interesting to note that the expressions in eqs .   and , combined with the charge neutrality condition @xmath383 , give a zero - temperature @xmath314-ratio which is different for periodic systems and random alloys .",
    "the experimental situation could be clarified by measuring @xmath535 and @xmath573 at various hydrostatic pressures on a single stoichiometric sample with low residual resistance .",
    "pressure can change the effective degeneracy of the ground state , increase or reduce the characteristic temperature of a given compound by several orders of magnitude and provide a crucial test for the ` universality ' of the @xmath568-ratio .",
    "pressure also has a dramatic effect on the overall shape of @xmath9 and we hope that the thermopower and specific heat data of of heavy fermion single crystals taken under hydrostatic pressure will soon be available .",
    "finally , it would be interesting to follow the behavior of the @xmath314-ratio as a paramagnetic system approaches a magnetic transition or a metal - insulator transition gives rise to large changes in the fermi volume .    this work has been supported by the ministry of science of croatia ( mzos , grant no .",
