    "neutrino oscillation experiments have indicated nonzero neutrino masses and mixings although they are not expected in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "one of the most plausible extensions of the sm to generate neutrino masses is the ( type - i ) seesaw mechanisms in which heavy right - handed majorana neutrinos are introduced .",
    "this mechanism can explain not only the small neutrino masses but also the baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) via the leptogenesis mechanism  @xcite . in the lepton sector",
    ", the leptogenesis is related to the cp violating dirac and majorana phases in the maki - nakagawa - sakata ( mns ) leptonic mixing matrix as well as some possible high energy phases @xcite .",
    "it is clear that there is no leptogenesis if all phases vanish .",
    "however , since there are many high energy phases @xcite , it is hard to make an explicit connection between the leptogenesis and the phases in the mns matrix . in order to establish a simple relation between them ,",
    "we need to reduce as many complex parameters as possible in the model . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a family symmetry is used to minimize the number of arbitrary parameters in the yukawa sector .",
    "another possibility along this direction is to consider the so - called two - right - handed neutrino ( 2rhn ) seesaw model @xcite , in which the number of parameters is less numerous than the ordinary seesaw model . in addition , spontaneous @xcite and dynamical @xcite cp violating approaches have been proposed .    in this letter",
    ", we explore the leptogenesis mechanism in the model with the friedberg - lee ( fl ) symmetry @xcite and directly relate it to the cp violating dirac and majorana phases in the mns matrix .",
    "the fl symmetry is a translational hidden family symmetry for fermion mass terms .",
    "several possible origins of the fl symmetry have been discussed in ref . @xcite .",
    "more detailed analyses of the symmetry have been given in ref .",
    "the fl symmetry combined with a rotational symmetry has also been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .    as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the introduction of the fl symmetry to the right - handed majorana neutrinos suggests that there exists one massless right - handed neutrino with the absence of the corresponding column of the dirac mass matrix in the basis of the diagonal right - handed majorana mass matrix . as a result",
    ", the model can be regarded as the 2rhn seesaw model .",
    "this , in fact , motivates us to examine the leptogenesis in the context of the fl symmetry to see if it provides us with a testable seesaw and leptogenesis model .",
    "this letter is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we propose a model with the fl symmetry on both the right- and left - handed neutrinos .",
    "we also examine the allowed parameters based on the present neutrino oscillation data . in sec .",
    "iii , we consider leptogenesis and estimate the net baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) as a function of the dirac and majorana phases .",
    "we give the conclusion in sec .",
    "we start with the conventional ( type - i ) seesaw framework with three right - handed majorana neutrinos . the relevant lagrangian is given by @xmath0 where we have omitted family indeces .",
    "we assume the diagonal charged lepton mass matrix and impose the twisted fl symmetry @xcite only on neutrinos @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a non - local grassmann parameter , @xmath3 is a column vector of c - numbers , and @xmath4 is the permutation matrix between the second and third families , given by @xmath5 here , we have adopted the specific combination @xmath6 discussed in ref .",

    "( [ eq : yd ] ) has the same form as eq .",
    "( [ eq : mr ] ) . as a result ,",
    "the model can not reproduce a realistic neutrino mass spectrum because we focus on a scenario in which one of three light neutrinos is massless in this letter",

    "thus , there are two interacting and one non - interacting massless neutrinos and no cp violating phase in the mns matrix .",
    "clearly , it is inconsistent with the experimental data of existing at least two massive light neutrinos .    in order to obtain a realistic model ,",
