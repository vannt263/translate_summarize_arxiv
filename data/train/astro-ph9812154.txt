    "recently , the comptel instrument aboard the _ compton gamma ray observatory _ discovered a new supernova remnant ( snr ) , gro j08524642 , as a strong source of @xmath0ti 1.16 mev line emission ( @xcite ) .",
    "the new source is located in the constellation vela in the direction of @xmath9 and @xmath10 . due to the short lifetime of @xmath0ti , @xmath11 yr ( @xcite ) , the fact that comptel can detect this source",
    "at all indicates that it is a young snr at a distance less than 500 pc with an age probably less than @xmath12 yr .    the comptel @xmath0ti source was soon identified with a previously unknown shell - type snr in _ rosat _ data of the vela region collected during its 1990 all - sky survey ( @xcite ) .",
    "designated as rx j0852.04622 , the new snr is seen within the error circle of the comptel source , but only at energies @xmath13 kev .",
    "the shell has a radius @xmath14 .",
    "spectral analysis reveals that x - rays from the majority of the shell are of thermal origin with a temperature of @xmath15 which is significantly greater than that of the surrounding area .",
    "this is why the shell can be identified only at high energies , and this also indicates a young age .",
    "the northern limb of the shell appears brighter and has an even higher temperature of @xmath16 kev .",
    "this component can also be fitted by a power law with photon index @xmath17 .",
    "in addition , the _ rosat _ data gives an upper limit of @xmath18 pc)@xmath19 @xmath7 to the density of the ambient medium in which the progenitor of rx j0852.0 - 4622 exploded ( @xcite ) .",
    "we show in this _",
    "letter _ that , assuming comptel and rosat detected the same source , the above observed properties can place rather stringent constraints on the nature of the progenitor star of gro j08524642/rx j0852.04622 ( hereafter gro / rx j0852 ) .    the supernova which produced the observed radioactive @xmath0ti",
    "would also have synthesized about the same amount of radioactive @xmath1al which has a much longer lifetime of @xmath20 yr and whose decay produces a @xmath21-ray photon at 1.8 mev .",
    "indeed , the comptel instrument has detected significant 1.8 mev emission from the vela region , whose origin has previously been attributed to the vela snr ( @xcite ) but later become less certain ( @xcite ) . however , the better coincidence of the centroid of the comptel 1.8 mev feature with the location of gro / rx j0852 prompts us to investigate if it is gro / rx j0852 that is responsible for most of the observed @xmath1al emission .",
    "the observed @xmath0ti line flux is @xmath22 @xmath23 s@xmath2 ( @xmath24 ) . for a nominal @xmath0ti yield of @xmath25 per supernova explosion ( sne , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , the observed 1.16 mev flux restricts the age of the source to be , @xmath26 at a distance of 100 pc . in theoretical models ,",
    "the yield ranges from a low of @xmath27 to a high of @xmath28 .",
    "we calculate the constraint on the age versus distance for the range of the theoretical yields , as shown by the solid curves in fig .",
    "[ fg : age - dist ] .",
    "while the thermal nature of the bright northern rim is debatable , the thermal x - ray emission from most of the shell is undoubtedly generated from shocks as the supernova blast wave runs into the ambient medium .",
    "the observed shell temperature of 2.5 kev implies that the shock front is currently proceeding at a relatively low velocity of @xmath29 the validity of such a direct conversion from the electron temperature to the shock front speed requires the electrons to be in equilibrium with ions in the post - shock region . for collisionless shocks ( as is the case for most young snrs ) , this condition may not always hold , if , for example , the magnetic coupling between the ions and electrons is not effective enough . in such cases ,",
    "the ion temperature , which reflects the true shock speed , could be greater than the electron temperature ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath30 calculated above is probably a lower limit ; the real value could be greater by as much as a factor of 2 - 3 .    over the lifetime of the snr",
    ", the mean expansion velocity @xmath31 may be higher than @xmath30 , depending on its progenitor type . from arguments we present below",
    ", @xmath31 is probably in the range of 20005000 km s@xmath2 . for given @xmath31 ,",
    "the observed shell radius gives another set of constraints on the relationship between age and distance , as shown by the dashed lines in figure  [ fg : age - dist ] .",
    "we see that the most probable value for the distance to the new snr is in the range between 100 and 300 pc , and for the age is between 600 and 1100 years . at a distance of 250 pc ,",
    "the snr has a radius of about 4.4 pc .",
    "now we discuss what possible progenitors are allowed by the observed and derived properties of the snr .",
    "we first assume that the environment in which the progenitor exploded has a uniform density @xmath32 @xmath7 , consistent with the limit derived from the rosat data .",
    "for an sne in such a medium , there is a universal solution for the early stages of snr evolution ( @xcite ) . immediately after the explosion",
    ", the blast wave expands freely during the so - called ejecta - dominated phase .",
    "the ejecta maintains a constant expansion velocity with a maximum value of @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the mass of the ejecta in units of solar masses and @xmath35 is the kinetic energy of the sne in units of @xmath36 ergs . for a type ia supernova ( snia ) of @xmath37 , @xmath38 is more than 10,000 km s@xmath2 . for a type ii supernova ( snii ) of @xmath39 , @xmath38 can be much smaller .",
    "therefore , if the progenitor of the new snr is an snia , the expansion must have been significantly slowed down which requires an old age .",
    "if the progenitor star is more massive than @xmath40 , the free - expansion velocity of an snii is close to the observed shock front velocity @xmath30 .",
    "after the blast wave sweeps up about the same amount of mass as the ejecta , the snr evolution enters the sedov - taylor phase , during which time the snr shell velocity decreases with time as @xmath41 .",
    "the timescale for the onset of the sedov - taylor phase is ( @xcite ) , @xmath42 where @xmath43 @xmath7 ) .",
    "therefore , an snii spends much more time in the free - expansion phase than an snia does .",
    "also , a higher ambient density of @xmath44 @xmath7 would reduce @xmath45 by a factor of 2.7 .",
    "it immediately follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : v_e ] ) that if the progenitor of gro / rx j0852 was an snia , the snr would have to be in the sedov - taylor phase by now because of the observed small shock velocity .",
    "however , for a typical snia explosion with @xmath46 ergs of kinetic energy , it would take about @xmath47 for the ejecta to slow down from an initial expansion velocity of 11,000 km s@xmath2 to the observed 1300 km s@xmath2 .",
    "this age can drop to @xmath48 yr if the real @xmath30 is a factor of 3 higher than that derived from the observed electron temperature by eq .",
    "( [ eq : v_s ] ) , but it is still more than an oder of magnitude longer than the data suggest . for an snia model to work ,",
    "the only other alternative is then to increase the ambient density by a factor of at least 10,000 to @xmath49 @xmath7 .",
    "the above argument can be more clearly illustrated by considering the theoretical snr expansion velocity as a function of the snr age shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : vel - age ] . the constant velocity portion of the curves represents the free - expansion ( or ejecta - dominated ) phase , followed by the @xmath50 sedov - taylor phase .",
    "we have adopted the kinetic energy for an snia to be around @xmath51 ergs and for an snii to be in the range @xmath52 ergs ( @xcite , 1995 ; hereafter ww94 , ww95 ) .",
    "the ejecta mass of an snia varies from the standard model of @xmath53 to special he - detonated models of @xmath54 ( ww94 ) .",
    "the ejecta mass of an snii is in the range between @xmath55 and @xmath56 . the shaded area in fig .",
    "[ fg : vel - age ] represents the parameter space that is preferred by the observations .",
    "we have allowed a factor of 3 uncertainty in the current shell expansion speed .",
    "if we take the default ambient gas density as 0.05 @xmath7 , we see from fig .",
    "[ fg : vel - age ] that the snia evolution track is totally inconsistent with the observations . to match the current expansion speed",
    ", the ambient density has to be higher than 500 @xmath7 for the snia model to be marginally acceptable . in this case , we chose a he - detonation model from ww94 with an ejecta mass of @xmath57 , which has a @xmath0ti yield of @xmath58 .",
    "the mean expansion velocity for this case is about 5100 km s@xmath2 at an age of 800 yr . from fig .",
    "[ fg : age - dist ] we see that this model with very high density does have a solution with a distance @xmath59 pc .    for the low ambient density condition , on the other hand",
    ", we see from fig .",
    "[ fg : vel - age ] that ( 1 ) there is a range of snii models allowed , and ( 2 ) all these models are still in the free - expansion phase , so @xmath60 . the model with the highest allowable free - expansion speed of @xmath61 km s@xmath2 ( _ upper dotted line _ ,",
    "[ fg : vel - age ] ) has @xmath62 and @xmath63 ; it produces @xmath64 of @xmath0ti ( ww95 ) .",
    "[ fg : age - dist ] then tells us that the source must be at a distance of about 150 pc and an age of about 700 yr .",
    "other models with smaller expansion speed have much greater progenitor mass of 25 to 40 @xmath65 .",
    "the lower dotted line of the snii range in fig .",
    "[ fg : vel - age ] corresponds to @xmath62 and @xmath66 .",
    "however , this model produces only @xmath67 of @xmath0ti ( ww95 ) ; in fact , the @xmath0ti yield of all the models in ww95 which have @xmath68 km s@xmath2 is less than @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , if the current snr expansion speed is less than 2500 km s@xmath2 , the remnant of a viable core - collapse supernova model has also to be in the sedov - taylor phase which requires a large ambient density of @xmath6 @xmath7 . for reasons we discuss below , this condition dictates the source distance to be at least 250 pc . from fig .",
    "[ fg : age - dist ] we see that at such a distance the snr mean expansion speed has to be @xmath70 km s@xmath2 because the @xmath0ti yield of these models is @xmath71 ( ww95 ) .",
    "therefore , we need small ejecta mass and large kinetic energy .",
    "the lowest ejecta ( @xmath72 ) model of ww95 has a @xmath0ti yield of @xmath73 and also a relatively low kinetic energy , @xmath74 ergs .",
    "it will produce a mean expansion speed of only 3700 km s@xmath2 for @xmath75 300 @xmath7 .",
    "a more energetic explosion usually requires a much more massive progenitor and thus even lower mean expansion speed .",
    "it is possible , however , that a massive star may undergo a supernova explosion ( resulting in a type ib or type ic supernova , for example ) after it loses a significant fraction of its envelop because of strong stellar winds .",
    "while ww95 s calculations did not take into account of this effect , we assume that it is conceivable that some core - collapse supernovae could have a kinetic energy as much as @xmath76 ergs and at the same time an ejecta mass of @xmath77 .",
    "if so , fig .",
    "[ fg : vel - age ] shows that such a model ( marked as snib ) can produce a marginally acceptable evolution track in an ambient density of 100 @xmath7 .",
    "the mean expansion speed in this case is 5100 km s@xmath2 , consistent with the required distance of 250 pc ( fig .",
    "[ fg : age - dist ] ) .",
    "we have seen that whether the progenitor of gro / rx j0852 is an snia or an snii , if the current snr expansion speed , @xmath30 , is less than 2500 km s@xmath2 , it is almost exclusively required that the sne occurred in a high density region , @xmath6 @xmath7 for an snii and @xmath49 @xmath7 for an snia .",
    "the distance to the source in either case is about 250 pc and most of the space along the line of sight still has a very low density of @xmath78 @xmath7 .",
    "we now discuss whether the required high density medium exists at the required direction and distance .    along the general direction of gro / rx j0852 , the only possible candidate of a high density region within 500",
    "pc is the gum nebula . while most of the gum nebula is filled with ionized , low density gas ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , recent reanalysis of the historical hi 21 cm data revealed two distinct structures associated with the gum nebula ( @xcite ) .",
    "one is a large , @xmath79 , disk of neutral gas which is 150 pc in radius and @xmath80 pc in thickness .",
    "the other is a smaller , thick hi shell of @xmath81 with a radius of @xmath82 pc ( @xcite ) , roughly at the center of the disk . both the disk and the shell share a distance of @xmath83 pc .",
    "therefore , the minimum distance to the edge of the disk is about 250 pc .",
    "the mean number density of the disk and the shell is 1.6 @xmath7 and 0.95 @xmath7 , respectively , far below the required value for the model progenitor of gro / rx j0852 .",
    "thus , both the snia and snib models require the presence of additional , much denser gas components at the edge of the hi disk .",
    "because the gum nebula was probably created by some ancient supernova events , it is conceivable that the highest density regions are located near the edge of the structure .",
    "a recent co survey has shown complex molecular cloud structure in the vela region ( @xcite ) .",
    "the map shows that gro / rx j0852 falls on the edge of one of the co hot spots but there is no morphological evidence that the cloud is disturbed by the snr .",
    "the distances to the components of this so - called vela molecular ridge are estimated to be 1 - 2 kpc based on the radial velocity profile , further suggesting that they may be unrelated to the snr .",
    "if for any reason that these distance estimates were inaccurate and the co hot spot near gro / rx j0852 had a distance of 250 pc instead of 1 - 2 kpc , the maximum mean number density of this component would be even smaller than the observed 16 @xmath7 ( @xcite ) , and fall short of the required minimum density of 100 @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , an extreme density of 500 @xmath7 , along with it the snia origin of the new snr , can be ruled out by the hi and co data ; even the snib progenitor also becomes a difficult proposition .",
    "if gro / rx j0852 was created by a snii event about 800 yr ago , an unavoidable consequence is that the same explosion which produced the observed @xmath0ti will also synthesize certain amount of @xmath1al .",
    "specifically , for the snib event favored by a small @xmath30 the @xmath1al yield is @xmath84 with a 1.8 mev line flux of @xmath85 photons s@xmath2 @xmath23 at a distance of 250 pc .",
    "this flux is about a factor of 3 greater than the observed flux observed from the vela region by comptel ( @xcite ) . the @xmath3 snii model favored by the condition",
    "@xmath86 km s@xmath2 , on the other hand , has an @xmath1al yield of @xmath87 , which would produce a 1.8 mev line flux of @xmath88 photons s@xmath2 @xmath23 , comparable to the observed value .",
    "it is thus intriguing to postulate that gro / rx j0852 is also a major contributor to the vela @xmath1al feature .",
    "indeed , recent reexamination of the vela data has argued against previous attribution of the vela @xmath1al flux to the vela snr ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the centroid of the vela @xmath1al feature , at @xmath89 and @xmath90 , is @xmath91 away from the center of the vela snr but falls right on top of gro / rx j0852 .",
    "the combination of the positional coincidence and the good agreement between the expected 1.8 mev flux and the observed value strongly favors this interpretation .",
    "since the 1.8 mev vela feature is probably slightly extended , it seems that both the vela snr , or a local concentration of the massive - star formation tracers ( @xcite ) , and gro / rx j0852 have contributed while the majority of the flux comes from the latter .",
    "we have investigated the parameter space allowed by the observed properties of the newly discovered snr gro / rx j0852 , assuming that the comptel @xmath0ti source and the rosat snr are the same source .",
    "we conclude that the likely progenitor of this new snr is a massive star and its precise type depends on the correct determination of the current snr shell expansion speed @xmath30 .",
    "it is most probably that the true value of @xmath30 is more than a factor of 2 greater than that derived from the shell electron temperature using x - ray data and the progenitor is a @xmath92 snii with a moderate sne kinetic energy .",
    "the age of the source is @xmath93 yr and the distance is @xmath94 pc . if the current @xmath30 were small , on the other hand , a much more energetic snib or snic event would be required to have exploded 800 - 900 yr ago in a high density medium about 250 pc away .",
    "this latter interpretation , however , has the difficulty of finding observationally the required high density gas at the required distance .",
    "the recently discovered cold neutral gas structure associated with the nearby gum nebula seems not to be able to provide the required high density .",
    "it is likely that the nearest sne less than 1000 yr ago in the vela region produced both the @xmath0ti and @xmath1al emission features detected by comptel .",
    "this offers an exciting new avenue to test the core - collapse sne models since the explosive yields of @xmath0ti and @xmath1al are related . because of its much shorter lifetime , @xmath0ti is usually better suited for discovering young snrs .",
    "however , since it just so happened that the age of gro / rx j0852 is about 8 - 10 times the lifetime of @xmath0ti , its @xmath0ti flux has dropped by a factor of 300010,000 from its peak value and now almost equals that of @xmath1al which has a decay lifetime that is @xmath95 times longer .",
    "it is thus worth noting that for snrs older than about 1200 yr , @xmath1al is a better radionuclide to use for snr searches ."
