    "transition metal oxides form some of the most intellectually rich electronic phases , _ viz . _ the high temperature superconducting cuprates , the colossal magnetoresistance manganites , and ordering of charge , spin , orbital and structural changes , especially in @xmath9 oxides .",
    "niobates are @xmath10 oxides that assume a fascinating sequence of crystal structures with assorted properties , extending from the cubic one - to - one , formally nb@xmath11 , metal nbo to the nb@xmath12-based wide - gap insulator nb@xmath13o@xmath14 , and encompassing a sequence of mixed valent compounds such as nb@xmath3o@xmath4 , nb@xmath15o@xmath16 , nb@xmath17o@xmath18 , nb@xmath19o@xmath20 , and so on .",
    "the 12 - 29 member , nb@xmath3o@xmath4 , displays local moment behavior coexisting with a relatively high density of conducting carriers.@xcite just how local moments  very rare for nb  emerge and coexist with itinerant electrons in this system has remained an enigma for decades .",
    "more broadly , systems of local moments embedded in conducting media form a rich platform for unusual phases , with phenomena including kondo systems , heavy fermion metals and superconductors , and still unexplained non - fermi liquid behavior .",
    "nb@xmath3o@xmath4 originally attracted attention@xcite due to the mixed valent character it implied for nb : 2 nb@xmath21 + 10 nb@xmath12 balancing the oxygen charge , apparently leaving two nb cations with @xmath22 configuration .",
    "it lies just inside the line of conducting compounds in the nb@xmath13o@xmath23 system , where coexistence of polarons and bipolarons had provided the prevailing picture of its conducting behavior.@xcite the tungsten bronzes , which share the same underlying wo@xmath24 structural motif , have been found to superconduct up to 4 k when heavily doped.@xcite    nb@xmath3o@xmath4 is found in two polymorphs , orthorhombic ( @xmath2- ) and monoclinic ( @xmath25 ) , both based on stacking of the same underlying structural feature ( described below ) but being stacked differently .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility of each polymorph displays curie - weiss susceptibility corresponding to one spin - half moment per f.u.@xcite @xmath26-nb@xmath3o@xmath4 orders around 12 k , in the sense that the susceptibility follows a behavior that peaks before dropping , in a manner that can be fit by the bonner - fisher form for a one dimensional ( 1d ) heisenberg antiferromagnet.@xcite @xmath2-nb@xmath3o@xmath4 does not show such a peak down to 2 k.@xcite    this first ( and still one of few ) observation of nb local moment behavior , moreover to be coexisting with nb conductivity,@xcite suggested a more specific picture@xcite of one @xmath27 electron becoming localized and magnetic while the other is itinerant and pauli paramagnetic . while this compound is a very bad metal , it is nevertheless also a standout transparent conductor , displaying resistivity @xmath28  3   m@xmath29 cm with only 10% variation@xcite from room temperature to 2 k , and it possesses a high carrier density@xcite of one carrier per nb thus not requiring tuning via extrinsic doping .",
    "recently argued from a density functional study using the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) functional that the monoclinic polymorph is an itinerant stoner magnet.@xcite our studies provide a very different picture of @xmath2-nb@xmath3o@xmath4 , and we contrast the two pictures below .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that orthorhombic @xmath2-nb@xmath3o@xmath4 presents an unprecedented type of material , based on an unusual large but strongly localized and magnetic organometallic - like orbital.@xcite this compound consists at the most basic level of an array of linear ( 1d ) heisenberg magnetic chains along the one direction , crisscrossed by 1d conducting nanowires along a perpendicular direction , coupled to a two dimensional ( 2d ) system by kondo interaction at each site .",
    "this new 1d@xmath01d heisenberg - kondo lattice ( hkl ) system arises from the intricate structure of columns of 3@xmath04 planar units of nbo@xmath1 octahedra , with the spin - half _ dimer mott insulating system _ arising from quantum confinement induced extreme localization on nb _ dimers _ with a specific @xmath10 orbital orientation , while other nb sites provide electronic conduction .",
    "these results should stimulate further study both experimentally , to identify the very low temperature and high magnetic field phases , and theoretically to probe a new model system for novel magnetic and possibly exotic superconducting states , since related 2d models have been shown to harbor pairing correlations .",
    "nb@xmath3o@xmath4 assumes two polymorphs , monoclinic ( @xmath26-)@xcite and orthorhombic ( @xmath2-).@xcite each is based on the same 3@xmath04 block structure of corner - linked nbo@xmath1 octahedra ( reo@xmath24-type perovskite ) that are stacked along the @xmath30 direction with lattice constant @xmath31 = 3.832   , thus forming rectangular @xmath323@xmath04 nanocolumns ( in @xmath33 order of the nb sites ) .",
    "the 3@xmath04 blocks contain six crystallographic sites nb1 , ... , nb6 .",
    "the two structures differ only in how these columns are repeated in the @xmath34 plane , a common motif in polymorphic shear structures .",
    "we focus here on @xmath2-nb@xmath3o@xmath4@xcite with @xmath35=20.740   , @xmath8=28.890   , whose crystal structure was only settled by use of xray diffraction together with convergent beam electron diffraction on single crystals by mcqueen _",
    "et al._@xcite the structure at 200 k , shown in fig",
    ".  [ structure ] , has centered orthorhombic space group @xmath36 ( # 63 ) with two f.u . per primitive cell .",
    "the primitive cell consists of two such columns , one of which lies @xmath37 lower / higher than the other , so these two nbo@xmath1 columns are connected edgewise rather than corner - linked .",
    "these shear boundaries , we find , severely limit carrier hopping in the @xmath34 plane . due to the distortion of the nb - o bond lengths and angles , the 3@xmath04 unit is ferroelectric in symmetry .",
    "the centering+reflection symmetry operation however results in no net electric polarization in the cell .",
    "density functional theory ( dft ) calculations were carried out initially using the spin - polarized perdew - burke - ernzerhof gga functional,@xcite implemented in an all - electron full - potential code fplo.@xcite the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath38 was treated within the the gga+u approach.@xcite we present results for @xmath39 ev , the value calculated@xcite for nb in perovskite srnbo@xmath24 , and hund s energy @xmath40 ev ; we verified that results are insensitive to the specific values .",
    "a similar value of @xmath38 has been applied in the dft plus dynamical mean field method to study the dynamical excitation spectrum of li@xmath41nbo@xmath13,@xcite which as one of the few strongly correlated niobates has become of interest because as a strongly layered transition metal oxide it becomes superconducting , thus displaying several similarities to the high temperature superconducting cuprates .",
    "the brillouin zone was sampled with a regular fine mesh up to 657 irreducible @xmath42 points .",
    "we first address the electronic structure before consideration of magnetism .",
    "the system was earlier found to be too intricate for hckel methods to elucidate.@xcite the atom - projected density of states ( pdos ) in fig .",
    "[ pdos ] reveals a sharp and narrow nb5-dominated peak , with secondary contribution from nb4 and nb6 , that pins the fermi level e@xmath43 and will be found to be unstable to local moment formation .",
    "itinerant band states around e@xmath43 are dominated by the nb2 site , with smaller nb3 participation but _ none _ from nb5 .",
    "the band structure in fig .  [ pmbands ] reveals a nb5@xmath13 _ dimer bonding band _ lying within the continuum of @xmath30-axis dispersive conduction bands , with remarkable flat - band dispersion of no more than 75 mev along each of the three axes .",
    "the antibonding partner lies @xmath282.8 ev higher and is bifurcated by additional interactions . from the small dispersion of the flat nb5 band ,",
    "we obtain the nearest neighbor hopping amplitudes along the three axes : @xmath44 mev , @xmath45 mev , @xmath46 .",
    "( the dispersion along @xmath30 is however not simple nearest neighbor type , in spite of the small value . )",
    "the anomalously flat band arises primarily from the nb5 @xmath47 orbital , which significantly has its lobes lying in the @xmath48 plane , perpendicular to the column @xmath30 direction .",
    "this orientation provides only a tiny @xmath49 overlap ( @xmath50 above ) for hopping along the short @xmath30 axis .",
    "the hopping amplitudes given above are orders of magnitude smaller than the on - site coulomb repulsion that will produce mott localization of @xmath47 states on the nb5@xmath13 dimer .",
    "the two neighboring nb5 @xmath47 orbitals form bonding - antibonding combinations by strong @xmath51 coupling , splitting the molecular orbitals by @xmath52 = 2.8 ev .",
    "the nb5@xmath13 dimer bonding combination @xmath53 is partially filled and pins @xmath54 .",
    "the nb2-derived conducting `` wires '' , a pair on opposing columnar faces perpendicular to @xmath55 and two columns per primitive cell , lead to four bands that disperse through e@xmath43 along ( @xmath56,0,0 ) .",
    "coupling between the conducting wires lifts the degeneracy , as can be seen from the occupied bands along @xmath57-x in figs .",
    "[ pmbands ] and [ fatbands ] .",
    "only two bands cross e@xmath43 along @xmath57-y",
    ". there are four flat , 1d sheets perpendicular to @xmath30 , plus some small and probably unimportant sheets .",
    "these flat sheets , with wavevectors @xmath58@xmath59@xmath60 , imply large susceptibilities and impending intra - columnar 1d instabilities at several fermi surface nesting calipers .",
    "the several different nesting wavevectors that connect the various 1d fs sheets will however tend to frustrate any specific instability ( _ viz .",
    "_ charge or spin density waves , or peierls distortions ) .",
    "the conventional gga treatment of electronic exchange and correlation processes produces a slater magnetic moment arising from the exchange - split flat band .",
    "however , in flat - band transition metal oxides such as this ( though rarely as extreme ) , explicit attention to on - site repulsion is important , so we focus on the gga+u treatment@xcite that is often successful in treating strong interaction effects . here",
    "@xmath38 is the hubbard repulsion on the nb ions supplementing the semi - local gga exchange - correlation potential.@xcite    from the correlated treatment , one peculiar feature is that the magnetic moment arises from a single electron on the nb5@xmath13 _ dimer _ rather than on a single atom .",
    "this distinction makes it a quarter - filled band system that results in a dimer mott insulating ( dmi ) subsystem,@xcite a phase not yet reported in otherwise conducting 3d systems .",
    "dimer mott insulators are rare , although a _ trimer _",
    "mott insulator has been reported.@xcite the nb5@xmath13 dimer orbital density @xmath61 , also the spin density , is displayed in fig .",
    "[ spindens ] , and its bonding character ( incorporating the intervening o ion ) is evident .",
    "this dmi occupied state however lies within the continuum of occupied conduction bands . from the nearly invisible band mixing with the conduction bands ( see fig .",
    "[ fatbands ] ) , it is found that band mixing ( charge coupling ) with the conduction electrons is quite small .",
    "then , from the splitting of majority and minority conduction bands ( see fig .  [ fatbands ] ) the exchange ( kondo ) coupling along @xmath62 , @xmath63 , between itinerant @xmath64 and localized @xmath65 spins at site @xmath66 , has coupling strength @xmath67 = 20 mev that reproduces the spin splitting of the conduction bands in fig .",
    "[ fatbands ] for ferromagnetic alignment .",
    "three features may be contributing to the special behavior of the nb5 site .",
    "first , quantum confinement : nb5 is the only site interior to the 3@xmath04 block , it is not an interface atom .",
    "second , its octahedron is much more regular than for the other sites , having only a single nb5-o distance@xcite greater than 2.00   .",
    "third , the anisotropic displacement parameter ( @xmath68 describing displacement from the ideal position in the @xmath30 direction ) is six times larger than for any other nb site , reflecting dynamic ( or possibly spatial ) fluctuations in position .",
    "nb@xmath3o@xmath4 thus presents a novel type of system with interacting local moments in a conducting background  a heisenberg - kondo lattice system .",
    "the earlier 1d hkl model has been generalized to two - dimensions in a maximally anisotropic matter : spin coupling in one direction and fermion hopping in the perpendicular direction .",
    "the basic picture is illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "[ schematic ] .",
    "geometrically , the picture is one of 1d heisenberg spin chains of nb5@xmath13 local moments extending along @xmath62 , sandwiched between nanowires ( or `` tapes '' ) conducting along @xmath30 , lying on the faces of the columns perpendicular to @xmath62 .",
    "the lack of dispersion along @xmath55 can be ascribed both to the electronic disruption caused by the shear boundaries , and to the centering+mirror symmetry operation that serves to produce maximum separation of neighboring nb sites .",
    "this picture of @xmath2-nb@xmath3o@xmath4 is differs from that of @xmath26-nb@xmath3o@xmath4 presented by fang _",
    "et al_.@xcite based on gga alone and the vasp code , they presented a picture of a weak itinerant ( stoner ) moment arising from a flat band with magnetic exchange splitting of 0.3 ev .",
    "this result is much like what we obtained for @xmath2-nb@xmath3o@xmath4 at the gga level ( see fig .  [ fatbands ] ) .",
    "our view is that the flat band requires consideration of correlation effects .",
    "several specific differences follow , viz .",
    "strong local moment leading to a dmi subsystem versus a spin - split band stoner moment in a fully itinerant system , and the corresponding coupling to the carriers .",
    "such differences can be resolved by more extensive experimental study at low temperature .",
    "from the hopping amplitudes given above , the largest magnetic coupling is not along the structural @xmath30 chain , but rather between neighboring nb5@xmath13 pairs in the @xmath62 direction , corresponding to a superexchange coupling through the oxide ions at the edges of the 3@xmath04 blocks of @xmath69 mev = 6 k. we presume",
    "the direct exchange will be smaller , based on the molecular orbital pictured in fig . 5 , because the direct overlap with neighboring orbitals seems very minor . the moments will be relatively uncorrelated along the conducting @xmath30 direction ( @xmath70 k ) , with the dominant antiferromagnetic ( afm ) correlations developing along @xmath62 only at low temperature below @xmath71 .",
    "this temperature scale is roughly consistent with that from susceptibility @xmath72(t),@xcite which shows spin - half behavior with @xmath73 = -14 k , but no deviation from curie - weiss behavior down to 2 k. the monoclinic phase , which we will address elsewhere , `` orders '' via displaying a @xmath72 peak at 12 k that can be fit@xcite with the bonner - fisher form@xcite for the 1d heisenberg chain ( which shows no true long - range order ) .",
    "the basic hamiltonian to model such a system , neglecting band indices and spin chain indices for the simplest model , is @xmath74 \\nonumber \\\\    & + &   j_h\\sum_j \\vec s_j \\cdot \\vec s_{j+{\\hat b } }    + j_k \\sum_{j } \\vec s_j \\cdot \\vec s_j,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 run over the 2d lattice and spin directions , @xmath30 and @xmath62 are the 2d lattice vectors , @xmath76 is the pauli spin matrix vector , and @xmath77 is the conduction electron spin at site @xmath66 in terms of the carrier creation operator @xmath78 .",
    "the energy scales are @xmath79=400 mev , @xmath80@xmath590.5 mev , @xmath67=20 mev . in this model",
    "an itinerant electron is confined to its nanowire , and suffers only kondo ( spin ) scattering due to the interaction .",
    "the 1d heisenberg chains likewise are perturbed only by spin coupling to itinerant electrons .",
    "the strictly 1d version of the heisenberg - kondo lattice model has been studied actively@xcite in the context of high temperature superconducting cuprates , where 1d structures with entwined charge , spin , and superconducting orders have been detected experimentally .",
    "the 2d hkl model has recently been applied to model behavior , and pairing symmetry , in heavy fermion superconductors.@xcite this new 1d@xmath6@xmath01d@xmath5 model of coupled 1d charge ( @xmath8 ) wires and 1d spin ( @xmath7 ) chains comprises a type of system with frustrating interactions .",
    "1d conductors have thoroughly studied charge- and spin - density wave instabilities at @xmath81 and @xmath82 respectively .",
    "are these instabilities overcome by the kondo coupling , which results in coupled 1d conductors and hence a 2d system ?",
    "the afm ordering tendencies of the heisenberg chain , which never actually attains long range order , is correlated with neighboring chains by the kondo coupling .",
    "a plausible mean field picture might be that heisenberg spin chains coupled , either in phase or out of phase , with neighboring spins chains by the kondo coupling through the conducting wires .",
    "the corresponding spin - exchange and magnetic ordering could introduce superstructure into the fermionic susceptibility at commensurate wavevectors , possibly influencing the diverging susceptibility at 2@xmath58 on the conducting systems , through the induced alternating  magnetic field \" transferred through the kondo coupling .",
    "this system may lead to a new form of magnetic polarons , accounting for the bad conductor behavior that is so prominent in low carrier density transition metal oxides .",
    "superconducting pairing tendencies become an attractive possibility , due to the analogies with cuprates ; note that nb@xmath3o@xmath4 is a magnetic 2d transition metal oxide with @xmath280.1 carrier per metal ion .",
    "we expect that low temperature and high field studies of this system could reveal unusual transport , thermodynamic , and spectroscopic behavior .",
    "in this electronic structure study of @xmath2-nb@xmath3o@xmath4 , two remarkable features have been uncovered .",
    "first , regardless of whether strong on - site interaction effects are included in the calculation , a remarkably flat nb @xmath10 band is found to exist within a bands of several itinerant ( dispersive ) nb @xmath10 bands . secondly , when correlation effects are included , the majority spin component of this flat band state is fully occupied , but the orbital is shared by two nb sites , the nb5 sites interior to the @xmath83 columnar array of nbo@xmath1 octahedra .",
    "the itinerant , conducting states are found to reside along the edges of the columns , forming 1d wires .",
    "the magnetic spins are ( i ) coupled to neighboring spins along a single direction , and ( ii ) coupled to the itinerant carriers by kondo coupling .",
    "this combination appears to be quite delicate : while the orthorhombic polytype that we have studied does not order down to 2k , the monoclinic polytype with many structural similarities  orders \" in the sense of a 1d heisenberg chain , with the susceptibility following the bonner - fisher form .",
    "the picture of nb@xmath3o@xmath4 that arises makes more explicit the earlier picture of `` one magnetic nb ion and one conducting nb ion . '' a local moment does emerge as required by the susceptibility data , but it is a highly unusual _",
    "dimer moment _ rather than a single ion moment .",
    "similarly , the conducting state arises not from a single nb ion providing an itinerant electron ; instead the conducting electron is shared between two conducting `` wires '' on either edge of the @xmath83 columns of nbo@xmath1 octahedra .",
    "the novel state that results is an illustration of how structural complexity can give rise to new emergent phases of matter .",
    "this new understanding of this nb suboxide should serve to guide study of the more complex nb suboxides mentioned in the introduction .",
