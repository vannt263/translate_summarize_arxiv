    "a large number of nonequilibrium systems can be qualitatively described as a flux of particles impinging on a surface or line .",
    "two heavily studied models of such systems treat the particles as either fixed in place upon impact ( random sequential adsorption ) or as free to diffuse along the surface or line ( random cooperative adsorption ) @xcite .",
    "one can also consider the deposition of particles that are free to desorb @xcite .",
    "some examples of the wide range of applicability of these models include coating problems , chemisorption , physisorption , the reaction of molecular species on surfaces and at interfaces , and the binding of ligands on polymer chains .",
    "jamming is one of the common occurrences in these systems that random sequential adsorption models effectively describe . loosely speaking , a jammed system is one that is locked into a state of partial coverage because of adsorbate size or shape .",
    "in addition to the various adsorption processes , jamming occurs in a wide range of nonequilibrium situations , including glasses , granular materials , and traffic flow @xcite . in spite of significant progress",
    ", no general framework exists for the description of jamming phenomena .",
    "a particular realization of random sequential adsorption is the parking lot model @xcite . in the irreversible version of this model , identical particles ( cars )",
    "adsorb on a line ( curb ) at a rate @xmath0 . in this model",
    ", the phenomenon of jamming has been known for some time @xcite .",
    "a certain number of the parked cars leave a space that is too small to fit another car .",
    "these are referred to as bad parkers .",
    "the result is a density of cars along the curb that is less than one .",
    "the density of cars reached in the irreversible model is the jamming limit .    in the reversible version , identical particles ( cars )",
    "adsorb on a line ( curb ) at a rate @xmath0 and leave the line ( curb ) at a rate @xmath1 .",
    "the removal of cars allows for adjustments in the bad parkers that relieve the jamming .",
    "recently , there has been renewed interest in the reversible case because of its successful application to compaction in granular materials when generalized to three dimensions @xcite . in this version ,",
    "the `` parking spots '' are voids in the material that can be filled with particles .",
    "the dynamics of the reversible parking lot model for large values of @xmath3 has a number of interesting features .",
    "perhaps the most dramatic feature is the existence of two very different time scales for the evolution of the coverage fraction of particles @xcite .",
    "first , there is a rapid approach to a coverage fraction that is equal to the jamming limit .",
    "this is followed by a slow relaxation to a larger steady state value .",
    "the slow relaxation is understood in terms of collective parking / leaving events involving multiple cars @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we present the results for simulations of the reversible adsorption of dimers on : ( 1 ) a one - dimensional lattice , ( 2 ) a two - dimensional triangular lattice , and ( 3 ) a two - dimensional triangular lattice with the nearest neighbors excluded .",
    "the one - dimensional lattice model @xcite was chosen as a test case , and the results are in good agreement with existing data . in particular , our simulations confirm the importance of collective parking events in controlling the slow dynamics , as seen in ref .",
    "the two triangular lattice models exhibit differences in their time evolution that can be attributed to effects of bond orientation and packing on the collective events .",
    "the case without nearest - neighbor exclusion corresponds to attempting to cover the plane with a shape formed by two regular hexagons sharing a side .",
    "the nearest - neighbor excluded case corresponds to a tiling of distorted hexagons that cover multiple sites .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii describes the details of the simulations .",
    "section iii presents the results for the one - dimensional model .",
    "section iv presents the results for the two triangular lattices .",
    "the simulations were motivated in part by experimental measurements of the viscosity of langmuir monolayers .",
    "a brief description of the experimental system and its relationship to the simulations presented here is given in section v. the results are discussed and summarized in section vi .",
    "for the one - dimensional simulations , a line of 32000 particles was used . both of the triangular lattices consisted of a grid of 1000 x 1000 particles . to distinguish between the two - dimensional models , we introduce the following nomenclature . model a",
    "will refer to the triangular lattice without nearest - neighbor exclusion .",
    "model b will refer to the triangular lattice with nearest - neighbors excluded from binding .",
    "particles are taken to bind to two neighboring sites on the lattice , forming a dimer .",
    "the binding occurs at a rate @xmath0 , and particles leave the surface at a rate of @xmath1 .    at each step in the simulation ,",
    "a site was chosen at random .",
    "then , a random number between 0 and 1 was compared with the ratio @xmath4 to determine whether a binding or unbinding event was attempted . for unbinding events ,",
    "if the chosen site was part of a bond , the bond was broken ; otherwise , no action took place . for binding events ,",
    "a nearest neighbor was randomly selected .",
    "a binding event occurred only if both sites were allowed binding sites .",
    "the definition of allowed binding site depends on the model .",
    "for the one - dimensional and model a cases , an allowed site is any site that is not part of a bond . for model",
    "b , if either site is part of a bond or the nearest neighbor of a bound site , binding is not allowed .",
    "it is important to note that the number of new bonds created is directly proportional to the number of allowed sites , which is not the same as the number of open sites .",
    "the number of desorption events is still directly proportional to the coverage fraction .",
    "the coverage fraction , @xmath5 , is defined as the ratio of sites that are part of a bond to the total number of sites .",
    "a schematic of each of the model systems with examples of bound sites is shown in fig .",
    "it is important to notice the different spatial structures in model a and model b. in model a , complete coverage corresponds to all sites being part of a bond . in model b , perfect coverage of",
    "the system corresponds to a tile of distorted hexagons that are composed of both empty and bound sites .",
    "this results in a maximal coverage fraction @xmath6 . for both the one - dimensional case and model a , @xmath7 . in this paper",
    ", @xmath8 will designate the steady state value of the fractional coverage , and @xmath9 will refer to @xmath8 in the case @xmath10 , i.e. the jamming limit .",
    "figure 2 shows @xmath5 as a function of iteration step for selected values of @xmath3 .",
    "we include the case @xmath10 , which gives @xmath11 . for comparison ,",
    "analytic calculations give @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the original work on the reversible parking lot model @xcite proposed a mean - field description of the dynamics that can be expressed in terms of the average density , or fractional surface coverage , @xmath5 .",
    "both the continuous and lattice versions of the parking lot model were considered .",
    "figure 3 shows the steady state value of @xmath5 for the values of @xmath13 plotted in fig .",
    "2 . the solid curve in fig . 3 is the value for @xmath8 for dimers binding to a one - dimensional lattice , as determined by the following equation from ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath14 the agreement between our simulations and eq .",
    "1 confirms the mean field prediction for the equilibrium values of @xmath5 .",
    "however , as with the continuous parking lot model @xcite , the mean - field description is unable to accurately predict the time evolution of @xmath5 . this can be seen in fig . 2 where the two time scales controlling the evolution of @xmath5 are evident for @xmath15 .",
    "the system rapidly reaches @xmath9 , and then slowly approaches its equilibrium value . as k goes to infinity , @xmath8 approaches one , but the time to reach equilibrium approaches infinity .",
    "this is in agreement with results for the continuous parking lot model reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "= 3.2 in    we have found that the explanation of the two distinct time scales reported in ref .",
    "@xcite applies to the discrete case as well .",
    "essentially , collective events are responsible for the evolution of @xmath5 for @xmath16 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors calculated the transition rates for two good particles to one bad particle and one bad particle to two good particles and found that these rates account for the additional slow time scales .",
    "in contrast , we directly monitor the transitions as part of the simulation .",
    "the reason such transitions result in an additional slow time scale can be understood in terms of the following argument .",
    "= 3.2 in    as discussed in the introduction , when @xmath10 , jamming occurs because of `` bad parkers '' that leave empty space . for the one - dimensional lattice",
    ", empty space refers to a single site that is unable to bond .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "4a . for small values of @xmath1 ,",
    "bad parkers initially occur at essentially the same rate as for @xmath10 because very few particles desorb .",
    "therefore , the coverage fraction for the system quickly approaches a value of @xmath9 .",
    "even when a value of @xmath9 is reached , the rare desorption event is generally followed immediately by a readsorption because @xmath0 is so large .",
    "the total number of particles is not changed by these events . however , when one bad parker desorbs and two particles adsorb in the opened good locations , then the number of particles is increased by one .",
    "likewise , if two good parkers unbind and one bad parker binds , the number of particles is decreased by one .",
    "because these events involve multiple particle transitions , they occur on a longer time scale then simple adsorption / desorption events .    for the one - dimensional discrete case",
    ", one can identify the relevant good to bad and bad to good transition that involve only two good parkers .",
    "these are illustrated in figs .",
    "4b and fig .",
    "as these events are expected to dominate the dynamics , one can write the following equation for the evolution of @xmath5 once the jamming limit has been reached : @xmath17 here @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the rates of bad to good and good to bad transitions respectively , and @xmath20 are collective transitions that a larger number of particles , and hence , occur at a slower rate .    = 3.2 in    we were able to track the bad to good and good to bad transitions during the simulation .",
    "this was accomplished by converting the particle sites to an array of bond locations .",
    "each location between two sites was assigned a value of 1 if a bond was present and 0 is there was no bond .",
    "for example , the solid lines in fig .",
    "4b would be represented by the string @xmath21 .",
    "notice , by definition , between any two bonds there is an open space , so the completely filled system is represented by @xmath22 .",
    "the string of bond locations was saved at step @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "each bond location was taken as the initial digit in a seven digit string , and these strings were compared for steps @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "we counted the following transitions : @xmath25 these transitions correspond to two good to one bad and one bad to two good , as discussed in fig .",
    "4c and fig .",
    "4b respectively .",
    "the choice of @xmath26 is important .",
    "if @xmath26 is too small , the transitions do not have enough time to complete .",
    "for example , in the extreme limit of choosing @xmath26 to be a single time step , it is not possible to have multiparticle events , but the total number of bound sites can change by one . essentially , @xmath26 must be large enough for the multiparticle transitions to have time to complete .",
    "for @xmath26 large enough , the recorded number of transitions is essentially independent of @xmath26 . for the data reported here",
    ", we used @xmath27 .",
    "in addition to counting multiparticle transition , we also recorded the total change in @xmath5 .",
    "figure 5 compares the actual value of @xmath5 as a function of the number of iterations with the value obtained using eq . 2 and the computed number of bad to good and good to bad transitions .",
    "once the jamming limit is reached , the bad to good and good to bad transitions account for 94.3% of the change in @xmath5 , confirming the general idea behind eq .",
    "2 . an additional 3.2% of the change in @xmath5",
    "is accounted for by considering a single class of three particle transitions where three good parkers were replaced by two parkers , and the reverse process .",
    "these were counted by considering 9 digit strings and looking for the transition : @xmath28 this curve is also plotted in fig .",
    "the spatial arrangement corresponding to this transition is shown in fig .",
    "it is important to note that when bonds exist at site d and e , the only way to increase the number of bound sites in this region is for two particles to desorb and three particles adsorb at sites a , b and c.    = 3.2 in",
    "the results of the simulation for @xmath5 as a function of iteration step for the adsorption of dimers on a two - dimensional triangular lattice ( model a ) and on a two - dimensional triangular lattice with nearest - neighbor exclusion ( model b ) are presented in figs . 6 and 7 , respectively . for model",
    "a , previous simulations have found a jamming limit of 0.9243 @xcite .",
    "our simulations give a value of 0.9120 . for model",
    "b , we find a jamming limit of 0.275 .",
    "recall that complete coverage in this case corresponds to @xmath29 .",
    "we are not aware of any previous work on a model b type simulation . however , by appropriately including the empty nearest - neighbor sites in the definition of @xmath5",
    ", we can compare to simulations involving n - mers of length 6 that cover a hexagonal patch .",
    "these simulations find a jamming limit of 0.6847 , and our converted value is 0.6875 @xcite .",
    "= 3.2 in    the results for the two - dimensional cases are qualitatively similar to the one - dimensional case .",
    "one observes multiple time scales : a rapid approach to the jamming limit and a slow relaxation to the steady - state value .",
    "this suggests that the same picture of multiparticle transitions will apply to the two - dimensional system .",
    "however , in contrast to the one - dimensional case , the identification of collective transitions is significantly more complex for model a and b because of the number of arrangements due to differing orientations of the bonds that can produce bad parkers .",
    "however , we did carry out a limited analysis for the case of model a.    = 3.2 in    the method used to track multiparticle events in model a was similar in concept to the one dimensional case .",
    "however , because the bonds have orientation , we compared the actual sites instead of the bonds for three classes of transitions : @xmath30 in this case , occupied sites are represented by 1 and unoccupied sites are represented by 0 . using sites instead of bonds results in some differences between the methods used in the two - dimensional and one - dimensional cases . first , the transitions counted in this manner correspond to classes of transitions in the following sense . because we track sites and not bonds , two neareset neighbor sites can be occupied either because they share a bond or because of two neighboring bonds that are at an angle to the line being considered .",
    "so , the first class of transitions includes the transitions that are exactly analogous to the one - dimensional good to bad transitions .",
    "but , it also includes multiparticle transitions that involve bonds at an angle to the horizontal and that successfully fill the empty sites along the horizontal .",
    "second , the offset of the 1 s and 0 s in the second two classes of transitions are important and reflect the underlying hexagonal lattice . note that because only nearest - neighbor bonding is allowed , the diagonal connecting the two zeros in each case is not an allowed binding site .",
    "finally , for the two - dimensional case , we exploited the hexagonal symmetry of the problem , and multiplied the rate for the first type of transition by three .",
    "the rates of the second two transitions are multiplied by 3/2 to account for double counting .",
    "the value of @xmath26 was chosen in a similar fashion to the one - dimensional case and corresponded to a constant interval in @xmath31 .    the results for @xmath5 as a function of the number of iterations and the value of @xmath5 computed from eq .",
    "2 using just these three classes of events defined above are plotted in fig .",
    "one striking feature of fig .",
    "8 is the fact that the two - particle events we identified account for nearly 100% of the dynamics until the number of steps reaches approximately @xmath32 . at this point",
    ", the coverage continues to grow , only there is essentially no change due to the identified two - particle events .",
    "this strongly suggests other two - particle events or higher - order events involving more than two particles are becoming important .",
    "an obvious question is : do the triangular lattices considered here apply to any experimental systems ?",
    "there is indirect evidence that the models discussed here are relevant to the binding of ca@xmath2 ions to a langmuir monolayer .",
    "langmuir monolayers are composed of insoluble , amphiphilic molecules that are confined to the air - water interface @xcite .",
    "they exhibit the usual gas , liquid , and solid phases , as well as a large number of two - dimensional analogs of smectic phases @xcite .",
    "many of these phases are hexatic , with the molecules locally arranged on a distorted hexagonal lattice .",
    "when ca@xmath2 is present in the water , it can bind two fatty - acid molecules together .",
    "this substantially alters a number of the physical properties of the monolayer , such as the lattice spacing and the viscosity @xcite .",
    "existing measurements @xcite and models @xcite of ca@xmath2 binding have focused on the equilibrium coverage fraction .",
    "however , the measurements have focused on time scales of one hour or less .",
    "the coverage fraction depends strongly on ph , which is understandable in terms of the degree of ionization of the fatty acid headgroup . at low values of the ph ,",
    "essentially all of the fatty acid molecules are neutral , and the ca@xmath2 ions do not bind . as the ph is increased , an increasing number of fatty acid molecules become charged , and the ca@xmath2 ions are free to bind to the monolayer .    the possible relevance of model a and b to the fatty acid monolayers is based on viscosity measurements as a function of time in the presence of ca@xmath2 for the hexatic phase of a particular fatty acid @xcite .",
    "figure 9 reproduces one set of data from fig .  2 of ref .",
    "@xcite , illustrating a typical time evolution of the viscosity .",
    "the viscosity increases 2 orders of magnitude over 15 hours .",
    "the time evolution can be divided into three distinct regions : an initial rapid rise in viscosity within the first hour , a slower rise in viscosity covering 5 - 6 hours , and a final even slower rise in viscosity . for comparison ,",
    "the computed fractional coverage of @xmath5 is shown in fig .",
    "9 versus the number of iterations . in this case , we have used a linear scale for the number of iterations . the previous plots all used a logarithmic scale .",
    "the time evolution of the ca@xmath2 binding exhibits the three general regions present in the viscosity data , and as such , provides a natural explanation for the effect .",
    "there are a number of points with regard to the connections between the model and the monolayer experiments .",
    "the simulations are consistent with the fact that previous measurements of ca@xmath2 binding do not observe multiple time scales . in the simulations ,",
    "the interesting change in coverage fraction occurs at late times , while in the experiments , only relatively early times are considered @xcite . also , the fact that the experiments agree reasonably well with equilibrium calculations @xcite is not surprising because the late - time changes in @xmath5 are relatively small in the simulations . therefore , longer experiments with more precise measurements of @xmath5 are required to directly observe the effects predicted by our simulations",
    "this discussion naturally leads to the second point : how do small changes in coverage fraction produce large changes in viscosity ?",
    "an ad hoc model that is capable of explaining the large viscosity rise assumes that the viscosity is proportional to 1/(a - @xmath5 ) , where a is a constant determined by the equilibrium coverage fraction .",
    "this model is based on the idea that the fluidity ( the inverse of the viscosity ) is proportional to the number of unbound sites .",
    "clearly , both more careful direct measurements of the coverage fraction versus time and a better theoretical understanding of the connection between viscosity and coverage fraction are needed .",
    "= 3.2 in    the final two comments concern possible refinements of the adsorption model when applying it to the monolayer system . in this paper , we considered the two cases of binding to any open pair of sites ( model a ) and binding with nearest - neighbor exclusions ( model b ) because they are simple cases with different geometric arrangements .",
    "the correct detailed description of the langmuir monolayer system is certainly more complicated than either of these .",
    "however , as mentioned , the degree of ionization of the monolayer is ph dependent . to zeroth",
    "order , model b is a reasonable description of a monolayer that is only partially ionized for two reasons .",
    "first , for a partially ionized monolayer , if a particular site is available for binding , it is highly unlikely that any of the neighbors will be available as well .",
    "second , the steady - state values of @xmath5 found in model b are in reasonable agreement with measurements of the values of @xmath5 reported for monolayers for ph between 5 and 6 @xcite .",
    "the second refinement concerns lateral diffusion of ca@xmath2 ions once they have bound to the monolayer .",
    "inclusion of diffusion should not substantially alter the qualitative results presented here , but it would effect the quantitative interpretation of the rate constants @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "one can model lateral diffusion of ca@xmath2 as the unbinding of a ca@xmath2 from one of the monolayer molecules followed by a rotation around its remaining bond and subsequent binding to another available site .",
    "however , this process could also be viewed as a complete unbinding and rebinding at a neighboring site with a renormalized rate constant .",
    "in addition , for @xmath5 to evolve in time , diffusion would need to be coupled with additional binding .",
    "this would result in rearrangements that are completely analogous to transitions from one bad parker to two good parkers .",
    "therefore , even with diffusion in the plane of the monolayer , the basic physics remains the same .",
    "jamming will still occur , and the slow relaxation of the bad parkers due to cooperative behavior will result in the slow time scales .",
    "equation 2 provides a means of expanding the dynamics in terms of collective events that occur on slower and slower time scales . we were able to directly confirm this in the simple situation of the one - dimensional model and for the two - particle transitions in model a. for the one - dimensional case , two - particle events were sufficient to describe the dynamics of the system , as was found in the continuous model .",
    "this results in two plateaus in the time evolution of the coverage fraction .",
    "single particle events , dominated by adsorption , rapidly drive the system to the jamming limit .",
    "processes involving two particles are sufficiently slow that @xmath5 plateaus for some time .",
    "the length of this plateau is controlled by @xmath13 , as @xmath13 ultimately determines the rates of multiparticle transitions .",
    "the larger the value of @xmath13 , the longer the system remains at the jamming limit . after enough time",
    ", the two particle processes have a sufficiently large contribution to the dynamics that @xmath5 increases at a noticeable rate until the true steady - state value is reached , and the coverage plateaus again .",
    "in contrast , one can imagine more complicated dynamics , such as multiple plateaus in the time evolution , occurring when collective events involving three or more particles are important .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "4d illustrates the existence of spatial arrangements of unbound sites that can not be corrected by two - particle events . in model",
    "a , fig .",
    "8 shows that the two particle events are not capable of bringing the system to its steady - state value , as they are no longer contributing to the dynamics at late enough times .",
    "this suggests that the remaining unbound sites occur in spatial arrangements that are analogous to those in fig .",
    "multiple plateaus would arise in the extreme case where the transition rates for two - particle and three - particle events are sufficiently different .",
    "this would occur as follows .",
    "the two - particle transitions would drive the system to some value @xmath35 in a given time @xmath36 .",
    "if @xmath36 was small enough compared to the three - particle transition rate , the system would stay at @xmath35 until the three - particle events contributed to the dynamics .",
    "identifying the existence of multiple plateaus is extremely challenging .",
    "first , the steady state value of @xmath5 must be sufficiently large that at late times the unbound sites are arranged in such a way that two - particle events are ineffective .",
    "this implies a sufficiently high value of @xmath13 .",
    "however , this in turn both decreases significantly the rate of collective events and increases the time to reach steady state . for model",
    "a and b , we have indirect evidence of multiple plateaus . in both cases ,",
    "the coverage fraction for @xmath37 appears to be leveling off at a value that is lower than the apparent steady - state values for @xmath38 , in the case of model a , and @xmath39 , in the case of model b. in principle , @xmath8 should approach one ( or 0.4 for model b ) as @xmath13 approaches infinity .",
    "therefore , the behavior for @xmath37 suggests the beginning of a secondary plateau .",
    "unfortunately , as discussed , the time required to achieve steady - state increases with @xmath13 , and we do not have sufficient computing power to determine if this is a true intermediate plateau for @xmath37 or if this is actually the steady - state value .",
    "it is clear that both analytic and more numeric work is needed to fully explore the effects of higher order transitions .",
    "identification of the higher order terms in eq .",
    "2 is an important step in this process .",
    "an exhaustive identification of all possible transitions is beyond the scope of this paper ; however , fig .",
    "10 identifies a small subset of transitions that illustrates why one would expect differences between model a and b for large enough times or large enough values of @xmath13 .",
    "figure 10a shows a set of transitions for model a , and fig .",
    "10b illustrates the equivalent ones for model b. in both cases , there exists at least two different classes of transitions that turn two good parkers ( labeled a , b , and c in fig .",
    "10 ) into one bad parker . for model",
    "a , if a and c desorb , then there are two possible sites that result in a bad parker , and two possible sites that result in the re - establishment of a pair of good parkers .",
    "but , if a and b desorb , then the situation reverts to the one - dimensional case .",
    "( in one - dimension , after two good parkers desorb , bonding to one out of the three open sites corresponds to the creation of a bad parker ( see fig .",
    "4c ) . ) for model b , if a and c desorb , then there are six possible sites that result in a bad parker , and six possible sites that result in the re - establishment of a pair of good parkers .",
    "this results in the same probabilities as in model a. however , in the a to b case , two sites are available for bad parkers , and two sites are available for good parkers . therefore , the chance of two good switching to one bad is increased . because differences in transition rates may affect the length of any additional plateaus ,",
    "detailed calculations of these rates are needed for a fuller understanding of the possible dynamics .      in conclusion , we present results of simulations of the reversible parking lot model for three different lattices .",
    "we have directly confirmed the importance of multiparticle transitions for governing the late time behavior in two of the models .",
    "the behavior of the third model is consistent with the other two .",
    "we discussed the implications of a description of the dynamics in terms of collective events .",
    "for the right ratios of transition rates , one would expect to observe multiple plateaus .",
    "there is a suggestion of intermediate plateaus in our system , but computational limits prevented any conclusive evidence .",
    "one alternative method for finding multiple plateaus would be to consider different particle shapes as a means of adjusting the relative rates of multiparticle transitions .",
    "finally , we presented the possible relevance of the model to the binding of ca@xmath2 to langmuir monolayers .",
    "we showed that the jamming and subsequent slow relaxation of the binding of ca@xmath2 ions is a strong candidate for the source of the long - time scales observed in the viscosity measurements .",
    "there are experimental and theoretical details that require further exploration , including direct measurements of the ca@xmath2 coverage fraction , modeling of the dependence of viscosity on ca@xmath2 coverage fraction , better modeling of ph effects , and both measurements and modeling of lateral diffusion .",
    "however , given how well the model presented here captures the time scales present in the viscosity data , such future studies should prove extremely fruitful .",
