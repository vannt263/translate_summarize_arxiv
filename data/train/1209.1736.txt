    "@xcite single crystals of solid solutions between pmn , pzn , or pzt and ferroelectric pbtio@xmath2 ( pt ) exhibit piezoelectric coefficients and electro - mechanical coupling factors that are much larger than those of conventional piezoelectric materials .",
    "despite many theoretical and experimental studies of these and other relaxor ferroelectrics , neither the relaxor ground state nor the relaxor transition are well understood , and there are few materials with comparable dielectric properties .",
    "@xcite    the structural properties of pmn and pzn display several common features . at a temperature @xmath16 , far above the critical temperature @xmath17 below which long range ferroelectric order can be induced in both pmn and pzn by cooling in a sufficiently strong external electric field , evidence of the formation of local regions of polar order , also known as polar nanoregions , has been obtained from refractive index measurements and neutron scattering pair distribution function analysis .",
    "@xcite the existence of such locally ordered regions implies that short - range , polar correlations are present , and these are manifested in the form of strong neutron and x - ray diffuse scattering intensity located in the vicinity of bragg peaks ( ref .  ) .",
    "the geometry of this diffuse scattering in reciprocal space is illustrated for two different brillouin zones in pmn at room temperature in fig .",
    "[ diffuse_summary ] ( identical results have been obtained for pzn as well ) .",
    "in contrast to the sharp , resolution - limited , bragg peaks that characterize long - range ordered structures , the diffuse scattering originating from short - range , polar correlations is broad in reciprocal space and forms rods that extend along @xmath18 .",
    "@xcite several models have been proposed to explain this reciprocal space structure , including pancake - shaped regions in real space ( ref .  ) , polar domain walls oriented along @xmath19 ( ref .  ) , correlations between chemically - ordered regions ( ref .  ) , huang scattering ( ref .  ) , and relatively isotropic displacements of the lead cations ( ref .  )",
    ". obviously no consensus or satisfactory description currently exists of the real space structure of the short - range , polar correlations that give rise to the large and temperature - dependent elastic diffuse scattering cross section in these relaxor materials .",
    "the similarity of the reciprocal space geometries of the diffuse scattering in pmn and pzn demonstrates that they are structurally similar on short length scales .",
    "however both compounds exhibit similar long - range ordered , average cubic crystal structures as well . at high temperatures",
    "both systems possess cubic pm@xmath20 m symmetry , while at low temperatures an average cubic unit cell is retained , at least insofar as neither compound undergoes a bulk structural phase transition as would be revealed by the splitting of a bragg peak . this low - temperature ,",
    "average cubic crystal structure has been well established for pmn using both x - ray and neutron scattering techniques .",
    "@xcite however the case of pzn is controversial .",
    "variable energy x - ray diffraction studies designed to probe the bulk and near - surface regions of single crystal pzn observed a cubic phase in the bulk and a rhombohedral phase in the  skin \" , which led to the discovery of an anomalous skin effect in relaxors .",
    "@xcite this discovery was later challenged by other researchers who , based on neutron powder diffraction measurements , concluded that pzn exhibits uniform rhombohedral ground state structure instead .",
    "@xcite on this subject the weight of experimental evidence seems to favor an average cubic ground state structure for bulk pzn because neutron diffraction measurements on pure pzn are plagued by enormous extinction effects and thus effectively probe only the near - surface region , and because similar skin effects were subsequently reported by x - ray diffraction studies of single crystal pzn doped with 4.5% pt and 8% pt ( pzn-@xmath21pt ) .",
    "@xcite moreover , various diffraction studies of single crystal pmn doped with 10% and 20% pt ( pmn-@xmath21pt ) show that while the near - surface regions ( probed by x - rays ) are rhombohedrally distorted ,  @xcite the interior or bulk of these crystals ( probed by neutrons ) remains metrically cubic down to low temperatures , thus confirming the skin effect in this system .",
    "@xcite subsequent neutron - based strain experiments found a significant skin effect in large single crystals of pmn as well that has since been observed with x - rays ,  @xcite and local regions of polarization have been directly imaged near the surface using piezoresponse force microscopy .",
    "@xcite under the application of strong electric fields the bulk unit cell in pmn remains cubic , whereas the structure of the near - surface region distorts ; however the intensity of the diffuse scattering arising from short - range , polar correlations can be suppressed by an external electric field , but only below the critical temperature @xmath22k , which is indicative of a more ordered structure in the material .",
    "@xcite    in view of these results we believe that the dielectric properties of both pmn and pzn can be described in terms of just two temperature scales : a high - temperature scale @xmath16 , below which static , short - range , polar correlations first appear , and a low - temperature scale @xmath17 , below which long - range , ferroelectric correlations can be induced by cooling in the presence of a sufficiently strong electric field .",
    "each of these temperature scales is reflected in the neutron elastic diffuse scattering cross section in pmn when measured as a function of temperature and electric field ,  @xcite as shown schematically in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ diffuse_cte ] .",
    "the high - temperature scale @xmath16 is defined as the temperature at which the elastic diffuse scattering cross section becomes non - zero , and the low - temperature scale @xmath17 is defined as the temperature at which the elastic diffuse scattering can be suppressed by electric fields and ferroelectric domains are formed . as shown by a recent high - resolution spin - echo study of the elastic diffuse scattering in pmn ,  @xcite the dynamics of relaxors also reflects these same two temperature scales .",
    "the onset of diffuse scattering at @xmath16 was found to coincide with the appearance of static ( at least on gigahertz timescales ) polar nanoregions that coexist with dynamic , short - range , polar correlations .",
    "@xmath17 was found to coincide with the temperature at which all short - range , polar correlations are static ( within experimental resolution ) .",
    "@xcite these two temperature scales are also clearly seen in measurements of the bulk polarization in la - doped pbzr@xmath13ti@xmath23o@xmath2 ( plzt ) where @xmath17 marks the temperature at which the field - cooled and zero - field - cooled polarizations diverge .",
    "@xcite these two temperature scales can be understood in terms of random dipolar fields that are introduced through the disorder that is inherently present on the b - site of lead - based perovskite relaxors .",
    "@xcite as a function of ti content @xmath21 , it has also been shown that @xmath16 and @xmath17 become equal at the morphotropic phase boundary ( mpb ) , where the relaxor properties are suppressed in favor of those associated with a well - defined ferroelectric phase .",
    "while the static structure of relaxors displays a range of interesting properties , the dynamics associated with the relaxor transition have many unusual features as well .",
    "the conventional picture of a ( displacive ) phase transition from a paraelectric state to a ferroelectric state is characterized by a long - wavelength ( @xmath24 ) soft transverse optic ( to ) phonon for which the frequency approaches a minimum at @xmath17 , as happens in the well - known paraelectric - cubic to ferroelectric - tetragonal phase transition in pbtio@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite the frequency of the soft mode @xmath25 is directly related to the dielectric constant @xmath26 determined from bulk measurements via the lyddane - sachs - teller ( lst ) relationship , which states that @xmath27 . therefore , neutron inelastic scattering measurements of the lattice dynamics provide an important tool with which to investigate ferroelectricity . in relaxors ,",

    "et al . _",
    "@xcite experiments performed by gehring _",
    "et al . _ and wakimoto _ et al . _ demonstrated the existence of a soft to mode in pmn and tracked its temperature dependence .",
    "@xcite the soft mode in pmn reaches a minimum energy around 400k and then recovers linearly ( i.  e.  @xmath28 ) at lower temperatures . as shown in fig .",
    "[ diffuse_cte ] , 400k closely matches the onset temperature of the elastic ( i.  e.  static ) diffuse scattering cross section in pmn when measured on gigahertz timescales using neutron spin - echo and neutron backscattering methods .",
    "@xcite motivated by these results , gehring _",
    "proposed that the upper temperature scale @xmath16 , more commonly known as the burns temperature , should be normalized from the value of 620k determined from the measurements of the refractive index in pmn , to @xmath29k , where the soft to mode reaches a minimum and static ferroelectric correlations ( i.  e.  polar nanoregions ) first appear .",
    "@xcite    an important anomalous feature found in these studies concerns the to mode measured near the brillouin zone center , which is unusually broad in energy compared to that in pbtio@xmath2 and even becomes overdamped , i.  e.  the half - width at half - maximum ( hwhm ) of the phonon energy lineshape @xmath8 exceeds the phonon energy @xmath30 over a range of temperatures and wavevectors ; this indicates that some mechanism is present that shortens the lifetime of long - wavelength to lattice fluctuations .",
    "the term  waterfall \" was coined to describe this effect , and originally the broadening was believed to be the result of scattering of to phonons from polar nanoregions .",
    "@xcite however , the same effect is seen in ferroelectric pmn-60%pt , which exhibits no diffuse scattering and is not a relaxor .",
    "@xcite this proves that the anomalous to broadening can not be associated with the relaxor phase but may be the result of the disorder introduced through the heterovalent nature of the b - site cations .",
    "another explanation for the broadening was expressed in terms of coupling between the to and ta ( transverse acoustic ) modes as is observed in batio@xmath2 ;  @xcite more recently this same idea has been used to explain the apparent  waterfall \" effect in pbte .",
    "@xcite however a series of other papers have reported the existence of a second , quasi - optic mode at low - energies in pmn , which would then complicate the dynamics near the zone center , thus giving the appearance of a broadening or an extra neutron inelastic scattering cross section at low energies .",
    "@xcite this interpretation is particularly attractive as it could reconcile the apparent discrepancies in the dielectric response with the frequency of the low - energy to mode expected from the lst relation described above as well as the measured deviations from the expected curie - weiss behavior .",
    "@xcite still other groups claim that the extra spectral weight at low energies originates from quasi - elastic scattering from short - range , ferroelectric ordering .",
    "@xcite    it is quite clear given the many different aforementioned studies that the low - energy neutron scattering cross section is neither well understood nor well characterized in relaxors . in this paper",
    ", we provide a detailed study of the brillouin zone and temperature dependence of the transverse acoustic phonons in pmn over the entire brillouin zone .",
    "we observe highly anisotropic acoustic lattice fluctuations that reflect the existence of a coupling between the acoustic harmonic modes and the relaxational diffuse scattering .",

    "@xcite the issue of energy resolution is extremely relevant here because when the diffuse scattering is measured using a technique ( e.  g.  x - rays ) that provides a substantially coarser energy resolution the resulting intensity will necessarily include an integration over the low - frequency ( quasielastic ) component of the diffuse scattering cross section , and this will lead to an artificially higher ( incorrect ) onset temperature .",

    "this physical model of coupling is consistent with the general ideas proposed for mode coupling in ktao@xmath2 ( ref .  )",
    "where it was suggested that the coupling constant scales linearly with the reduced wavevector @xmath7 measured relative to the brillouin zone center .",

    "we also observe that the anomalies in the energy position become less pronounced at smaller wavevectors and lower energies .",
    "we remark that our data reflects the lattice dynamics of pmn on the thz energy scale , which is nearly three orders of magnitude larger than that reported by ultrasound or brillouin scattering experiments .",
    "we therefore conclude that the effects reported at much lower frequencies are distinct from those presented here .",
    "we also note that infrared and dielectric experiments have reported significant dynamics down to much lower frequencies than are accessible with neutron scattering techniques .",
    "based on the slopes of the acoustic phonon dispersions near the zone center , we can calculate the elastic constants using the equations of motions outlined in ref .  .",

    "we have restricted ourselves to wavevectors less than 15% of the brillouin zone in order to assure linearity in the dispersion .",
    "the values of the elastic constants for pmn at 300k are listed in table  [ table : sample ] and are compared to values obtained from brillouin scattering measurements .",

    "it is interesting to note that near the morphotropic phase boundary ( mpb ) , which occurs when @xmath129%pt is substituted for pmn , the difference c@xmath11-c@xmath12 reduces further and nearly approaches zero , but then increases for ti - rich compositions beyond the mpb boundary .",
    "@xcite this suggests the presence of an instability of relaxors to ta@xmath5 phonons .",
    "@xcite this softening of the acoustic branch maybe a contributing factor to the increased coupling observed between the relaxational and harmonic modes in the ( 100 ) and ( 110 ) brillouin zones .",
    "another difference is seen in the values of the elastic anisotropy , defined as 2c@xmath10/(c@xmath11-c@xmath12 ) , which for pmn is 1.43 and for pbtio@xmath2 is 0.75 .",

    "this finding stands in contrast to that in ref .  , which presents brillouin data measured in the mhz range that shows a large softening of the elastic constants ( including c@xmath10 ) .",

    "such ti - rich compositions also show no relaxor properties ; instead they exhibit well - defined ferroelectric phases at low temperatures similar to that reported in pbtio@xmath2 . as further evidence that the ta phonon damping reported here in pmn",
    "is related to the polar nanoregions that are associated with the diffuse scattering cross section , we present several comparative constant-@xmath54 scans of the ta@xmath5 phonons in pmn-60%pt measured near the ( 110 ) brillouin zone in fig .",
    "[ pmn_60pt_figure ] .",

    "@xcite the phonons in fig .",
    "[ pmn_60pt_figure ] are also well - defined and underdamped .",
    "the temperature of 590k at which these scans were made was chosen because it is just above the structural transition of @xmath130k and serves to demonstrate that the suppression of the diffuse scattering cross section removes the strong damping and energy renormalization reported earlier for pmn in fig .",
    "[ dispersion_110 ] .",
    "these results confirm the fact that the large damping and softening of the ta@xmath5 mode in pure pmn is the result of short - range , polar correlations or polar nanoregions .",

    "the to mode in the ( 110 ) zone was too weak to provide any information on the dampening . while the to mode in the ( 100 ) zone was also prohibitively weak , the diagram above assumes the lineshape should scale as the structure factor .",
    "further discussion of the curves is provided in the text.,width=321 ]    we have reported the results of a detailed study of the acoustic phonons in a number of brillouin zones in pmn .",
    "we have observed that the ta phonons measured in the ( 200 ) and ( 220 ) brillouin zones are well - defined and exhibit a conventional temperature dependence expected from harmonic theory in the absence of strong ta - to mode coupling .",
    "while the to phonon cross section in these zones is strong and readily observable , the diffuse scattering intensity is weak .",
    "the situation in the ( 100 ) and ( 110 ) brillouin zones is completely different . in these zones",
    "the diffuse intensity is strong and the optic phonon structure factor is weak .",
    "while the ta phonons in these zones ( particularly in the ( 110 ) brillouin zone ) take on a heavily damped lineshape because of a strongly renormalized energy scale , the energy linewidth is similar to that observed in the ( 200 ) and ( 220 ) brillouin zones . because the lattice dynamics in different brillouin zones is invariant , we attribute the damped lineshape in these zones to a strong coupling between the diffuse scattering intensity and the ta mode .    for temperatures @xmath131 , the ta@xmath5 phonons studied in the ( 110 ) brillouin zone become overdamped over nearly the entire zone .",
    "however , low-@xmath7 phonons representing long - wavelength excitations remain underdamped as expected on the basis of a coupling strength that scales with @xmath7 .",
    "@xcite the ta@xmath6 phonons measured in the ( 100 ) brillouin zone display significant damping at small wavevectors .",
    "these phonons recover below t@xmath132 . at larger wavevectors , however , while some damping is seen , the ta@xmath6 phonons remain underdamped at all temperatures .",
    "the difference in behavior between ta@xmath133 and ta@xmath95 phonons is consistent with the idea of coupling between the diffuse scattering cross section and ta phonons because the former is a maximum when measured along [ 1@xmath40 ] .    the behavior of the low - energy ta and to phonons is qualitatively summarized in fig .  [ cartoon ] .",
    "this figure illustrates the low - energy ta and to modes and denotes a broadening of the mode , indicative of damping , through the shading .",
    "based on our experimental measurements , we observe a direct correlation between the damping of the ta mode and the the diffuse scattering cross section ; we therefore conclude that there is a strong coupling between the two .",
    "we have also reported strong damping of the ta phonon in the ( 200 ) and ( 220 ) brillouin zones , representing the anisotropy of the polar correlations .",
    "indeed the presence of a strong relaxational component to the diffuse scattering may help to explain recent hyper - raman data ,  @xcite which were used to support the case for a second , low - energy to mode .",
    "we note that this study never observed a well - defined , underdamped mode , but rather a strongly - damped feature that could be interpreted in terms of relaxational dynamics .",
    "thus many of the anomalous features resulting from extra intensity at low energies in the ( 300 ) brillouin zone could be interpreted in terms of the strong diffuse scattering coupling with the harmonic modes as observed in our data , which were measured in the absence of strong optic modes .",
    "we do not agree with the interpretation of the waterfall effect , or the temperature dependence of the ta and to modes , in terms of coupling between ta and to modes .",
    "such suggestions have been motivated by a comparison with batio@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite however , the lattice dynamics of batio@xmath2 and pmn are completely different .",
    "the coupling in batio@xmath2 along [ 110 ] results from the fact that the ta and soft to mode branches cross at small wavevectors ; thus , because these modes also have the same symmetry , they become strongly coupled and spectral weight is transferred between the modes , which then produces large energy shifts .",
    "@xcite such a situation does not occur in pmn because the lattice dynamics are relatively isotropic in comparison to batio@xmath2 and no mode crossing occurs . we have shown that no significant changes occur in either the ta phonon energy position or the spectral weight , both of which should happen in a strong coupling picture . while some small amount of coupling must exist owing to the fact that the low - energy ta and to phonons have the same symmetry",
    ", we do not believe that this weak coupling dominates the physics of pmn as previously suggested based on the comparison with batio@xmath2 .",
    "we do see anomalies in the ta phonons measured in the ( 100 ) and ( 110 ) brillouin zones .",
    "but we have proven that these anomalies can not be the result of coupling to the to mode because they are absent in the ( 200 ) and ( 220 ) brillouin zones , precisely where the to phonon structure factor is strong .",
    "by contrast , the to phonon structure factor is weak in the ( 100 ) and ( 110 ) brillouin zones and this phonon is not easily seen in a constant-@xmath54 scan .",
    "this makes the ta - to mode coupling idea highly improbable because the coupling comes from terms proportional to @xmath134 , where @xmath135 is the coupling constant and @xmath136 is the phonon structure factor .",
    "@xcite a brillouin zone in which the to mode cross section is weak will therefore display weak coupling effects between ta and to phonon branches . interpreting the phonon anomalies we have observed in ( 100 ) and ( 110 ) brillouin zones in terms of ta - to",
    "mode coupling is therefore not self consistent .",
    "several studies , including ref .   and ref .  ,",
    "have proposed ta - to mode coupling in order to explain anomalies observed at small wavevectors in the ( 300 ) brillouin zone . but this zone has a very strong diffuse scattering cross section ( see ref .  ) and a strong to mode , which softens to low energies at small wavevectors .",
    "it is possible that a coupling may exist between the diffuse scattering and the to mode , and this might provide an alternate explanation of some of the anomalous features in this zone such as the observation of a different @xmath7-dependent to phonon damping compared to other brillouin zones ( ref .  ) and an apparent enhancement of the ta mode intensity ( ref .  ) .",
    "it might also provide an explanation for the presence of a second  quasi - optic \" mode that was also observed in the ( 300 ) brillouin zone .",
    "@xcite    we believe a much more likely cause of the broadening of the soft to mode ( i.  e.  the waterfall effect ) may be the presence of strong disorder induced by random , dipolar fields .",
    "this would explain the broadening observed in both pure pmn and pmn-60%pt , which is largely absent in the parent compound pbtio@xmath2 .",
    "it is interesting to note that disorder has been suggested as the origin of the broadening of the soft to mode in batio@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite      the broadening of the low - energy transverse optic mode has been explained in terms of a second mode based on hyper - raman ( ref . ) and some neutron scattering results ( refs . ) .",
    "we provide an alternative explanation in this paper for the low - energy spectral weight and we do not believe that our results , particularly in the @xmath54=(1,1,0 ) and ( 1,0,0 ) zones , are consistent with this picture .",
    "the broadening that we observe at low energies in these brillouin zones becomes less pronounced and to vanish in the limit @xmath137 0 .",
    "this is consistent with coupling to a relaxational component and inconsistent with a zone center feature such as a second optic mode .",
    "furthermore , we note that the broadening coincides with t@xmath138 400 k where a static component to the diffuse scattering is onset at lower temperatures ( ref . ) , therefore linking the anomalous broadening we observe to the relaxational dynamics characterizing the diffuse scattering .",
    "we note that we have not pursued an understanding of the @xmath54=(3,0,0 ) brillouin zone ( as discussed in refs . ) in this report as the combination of strong optic , acoustic , and diffuse scattering are present and will undoubtably complicate the interpretation of the dynamics .",
    "hyper - raman experiments ( ref . ) , however , illustrate the presence of significant spectral weight at small energy transfers consistent with a second low - energy optic mode .",
    "the temperature dependence was believed to point to a softening at 400 k , consistent with the neutron results described in refs . .",
    "the interpretation in terms of two modes is further corroborated by the splitting of higher energy optic modes probed using raman spectroscopy .",
    "@xcite the low - energy measured peaks , however , are significantly broader than the resolution and are over damped with the linewidth being larger or at least comparable with the energy position .",
    "we therefore believe that the data is consistent the results presented here in the @xmath54=(2,0,0 ) and ( 2,2,0 ) zones where the zone center scattering is interpreted in terms of a single over damped mode .",
    "the hyper raman results maybe also consistent with the relaxational component to the diffuse scattering observed with spin - echo techniques .",
    "the comparison made by raman techniques to higher energy split modes is compelling and neutrons have not yet been successful in observing a splitting of these higher energy modes .",
    "several models of the diffuse scattering have challenged the idea that polar nanoregions are highly anisotropic in real space .",
    "@xcite the results presented here challenges these ideas and instead point to a damping mechanism that is highly anisotropic given the large differences observed between the ta@xmath6 and ta@xmath5 phonons in the ( hk0 ) scattering plane .",
    "the large degree of anisotropy in the damping implies some sort of real space structure that is also highly anisotropic .",
    "phonons propagating along directions that exhbiti weak polar correlations are likely to be more heavily damped than phonons propagating along directions where long range correlations exist .",
    "our results further suggest that short - range , polar order is responsible for the strong damping of the ta phonons and that the size of this damping is tied to the correlation length associated with the diffuse scattering .",
    "we note that the ta phonon damping reported here only reflects anisotropic correlations .",
    "thus we are not able to favor the  pancake \" model over the [ 1@xmath40 ] domain model proposed by different groups .",
    "the results here simply point to anisotropic polar correlations .",
    "considerable debate and discussion have been devoted to the nature and existence of the well - known burns temperature , which for pmn is purported to occur around 620k .",
    "our studies here suggest that this high - temperature scale is a purely dynamic phenomena and thus depends on the energy resolution of the experimental probe used to measure it .",
    "this is consistent with results from neutron dynamic pair density function analysis , which illustrate that the off - centering of the lead in pmn is dynamic at temperatures above @xmath139k .",
    "@xcite static , polar regions begin to appear at 420k where we observe a minimum in the soft to frequency and the appearance of static diffuse scattering on ghz timescales measured with neutron inelastic scattering .",
    "this lower temperature is also consistent with raman studies in which a splitting of some modes was observed , although this was interpreted as evidence for a third temperature scale .",
    "@xcite a third temperature scale has also been postulated based lattice constant measurements ;  @xcite however , as demonstrated here , such evidence is highly suspect given that the thermal expansion is sample dependent , and possibly results from the effect of a significant skin effect .",
    "we believe that all of the results on pmn can be broadly interpreted in terms of only two temperature scales . a high temperature scale ( @xmath64k ) , which is characterized by the appearance of static polar correlations and where a minimum in the soft mode energy exists , and a lower temperature scale ( @xmath22k ) , where domains form and a long - range ferroelectric phase can be induced through the application of a sufficiently strong electric field .",
    "we believe the burns temperature is dynamical and should not be interpreted in terms of a well - defined phase transition .",
    "this idea was discussed in ref .   where the burns temperature was redefined to be @xmath140k for pmn , instead of the much higher value of 620k that had been derived from index of refraction measurements .",
    "the two temperature scales discussed here are naturally reflected in the dynamics of the ta phonons presented above .",
    "the high temperature scale ( @xmath16 ) is where the broadening of both the ta@xmath6 and ta@xmath5 phonons is a maximum and where the energy renormalization due to the coupling to the relaxational diffuse scattering is most apparent .",
    "the lower temperature scale ( @xmath17 ) marks the recovery of the ta@xmath6 phonon in terms of a decrease in the damping in energy .",
    "this lower temperature scale is not strongly apparent in the dynamics of the ta@xmath5 phonon , however , we propose that this is due to the real space structure of the low - temperature ferroelectric domains .",
    "we emphasize that our results only demonstrate that the ferroelectric correlations in real space are highly anisotropic ; this is consistent with the pancake model ( ref .  ) and all other models that invoke anisotropic correlations ( for example ref .  ) .",
    "we are not able to distinguish between these various models on the basis of our experimental data .",
    "we have demonstrated an anisotropic damping and energy renormalization of the ta phonons in pmn .",
    "ta phonons in all zones display strong damping below @xmath16 , where static diffuse scattering is onset , indicative of short - range , polar order . only below @xmath17 , where the diffuse scattering becomes completely static ,",
