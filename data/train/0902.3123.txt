    "magnetic fields in the milky way are investigated via faraday rotation of the polarized light from pulsars and extragalactic ( eg ) sources , and through measurements of the galactic synchrotron radiation  @xcite .",
    "the observations reveal the presence of a large - scale ( ls ) galactic magnetic field ( gmf ) , that in the first approximation follows the spiral arm structure .",
    "the ls field extends above and below the galactic disk on a kiloparsec scale and forms a kind of halo .",
    "a random gmf , of the strength similar to that of the regular component , but with the coherence length of only @xmath0{pc}$ ] , has also been observed  @xcite .",
    "the average strength of the total magnetic field near the sun is about @xmath1 .",
    "however , details of the field distribution are poorly known  @xcite .",
    "the pierre auger observatory  @xcite provides a new and independent way of studying cosmic magnetic fields , by collecting cr events above @xmath2{eev } \\equiv \\unit[10^{19}]{ev}$ ] with unprecedented statistics and data quality .",
    "recently , auger observed a significant correlation ( over angular scales @xmath3 ) of the arrival directions of cr above @xmath4{eev}$ ] with the locations of nearby agn  @xcite , and a strong steepening of the cr flux above @xmath5{eev}$ ]  @xcite .",
    "both observations are consistent with the standard uhecr astrophysical acceleration scenarios and thus represent an important step towards the `` charged particle astronomy '' .",
    "the elaboration of relevant analysis methods for the uhecr astronomy requires detailed investigation of the cosmic ray propagation in the gmf .",
    "we present in this paper results of such studies , performed in the light of the observed agn correlation .",
    "we used the standard method of cr backtracking . a large number of cr events has been simulated using parameters described below , and propagated under three distinctive large - scale gmf models .",
    "we present the resulting magnetic deflections and modification of the extragalactic exposure due to the ls gmf .",
    "to obtain the uhecr trajectories , we implemented the integration of the equations of motion of an ultrarelativistic particle in the magnetic field using the runge - kutta @xmath6 order scheme with the adaptive step size control  @xcite .",
    "the particles have been followed till the galactocentric distance of @xmath7{kpc}$ ] ( the galaxy `` border '' ) , beyond which the gmf strength is supposed to be negligibly small .",
    "an accuracy level ( the accepted truncation error ) of @xmath8 has been adopted , for which the changes in the backtracked directions become negligible with respect to the chosen step in angular separation @xmath9 from the selected astrophysical objects ( see the section  [ s : scanparameters ] ) . to avoid the `` numerical dissipation '' of the cr energy  @xcite",
    ", we preserved the absolute value of the cr velocity vector during propagation .",
    "* energies * of the simulated events were bounded between and , and distributed according to the auger measurement  @xcite , as a power law @xmath10 .",
    "two options for the * angular distribution * of the events have been considered : 1 ) uniform over the whole sky ( 10@xmath11 events ) , and 2 ) according to the exposure of the auger surface detector ( sd ) for zenith angles @xmath12  @xcite ( 10@xmath13 events ) .",
    "four pure * mass compositions * have been considered : protons , carbon , silicon , and iron nuclei .",
    "we have chosen amongst many available large - scale gmf models _ three _ typical ones with distinct qualitative differences .",
    "two models are the spiral disk field models of  _ bisymmetric even parity _ ( hereafter * model  i * ) , and _ axisymmetric odd parity _ ( * model  ii * ) from the paper  @xcite by harari , mollerach and roulet ( hmr ) .",
    "* model  iii * is a modification of the model @xcite by prouza and mda ( ps ) , that has been proposed by kachelrie  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the _ bisymmetric even parity _ spiral field , of the structure similar to the one in model  i , it features two additional large - scale halo gmf components : _ toroidal _ azimuthal field above and below the galactic disk , and _ poloidal _ ( dipole ) field .",
    "the cosmic ray deflection patterns obtained using the three selected gmf models are very different , and have trends , typical for each model .",
    "[ fig : hmrmodels_defldir ] shows deflections of primary _ protons _ for models i and ii . in the bisymmetric even parity field , cr arrival directions at the galactic border point in general to higher galactic latitudes than observed on earth . in the odd parity field ,",
    "the backtracked arrival directions in each galactic hemisphere are shifted to the poles , and no cosmic rays are coming from the directions close to the galactic plane .",
    "the presence of dipole and toroidal fields in model iii makes the deflection pattern even more complex  @xcite .",
    "the deflection values for the three gmf models , and _ the auger sd exposure _ are summarized in the table  [ t : deflectionandlog10pmin ] , by means of percentiles at 50% ( median ) , and 95.45% of the c.d.f .",
    "the median deflection values scale well with the atomic number @xmath14 of primary nuclei .",
    "they are larger for the hmr models than in model iii , due to the more important halo field extension .",
    "the simulated events allow to roughly estimate the corresponding deflections expected from turbulent magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "compared to the deflections from the large - scale field , the former ones have to be much smaller , which is confirmed by simulations including turbulent field  @xcite , and can be neglected at the first approach .",
    "( de-)focusing effects of the galactic magnetic field make the correspondence between the cr arrival directions on earth , and the eg sources contributing to the cr flux entering the galaxy non - trivial  @xcite .",

    "our studies of the uhecr propagation in the ls gmf show that the uhecr picture observed on earth is sensitive to the assumptions on the field structure and/or primary cr composition .",
    "the exact deflection value in the regular component of the field depends strongly on the arrival direction on earth of a cosmic ray , with the corresponding position angle of deflection differing from one assumed field distribution to another . to discriminate between gmf models ,",
