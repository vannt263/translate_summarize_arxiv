    "the famous low - energy theorem of low @xcite and gell - mann and goldberger @xcite for compton scattering of real photons off a nucleon is based on the requirements of gauge invariance , lorentz covariance , crossing symmetry , and the discrete symmetries .",
    "the low - energy amplitude is specified up to and including terms linear in the photon energy .",
    "the taylor series coefficients are expressed in terms of the charge , mass , and magnetic moment of the target .",
    "terms of second order in the frequency , which are not determined by this let , can be parametrized in terms of two new structure constants , the electric and magnetic polarizabilities @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recently , the investigation of low - energy virtual compton scattering ( vcs ) as tested in , e.g. , the reactions @xmath3 @xcite and @xmath4 @xcite , has attracted a lot of interest . the possibilities to investigate the structure of the target increase substantially ,",
    "if virtual photons are used since ( a ) photon energy and momentum can be varied independently and ( b ) longitudinal components of the transition current are accessible . for the nucleon ,",
    "the model - independent properties of the low - energy vcs amplitude have been identified in @xcite whereas the spin - zero case has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in @xcite",
    "the model - dependent part beyond the let was analyzed in terms of a multipole expansion . keeping only terms linear in the energy of the final photon ,",
    "the corresponding amplitude was parametrized in terms of ten so - called generalized polarizabilities ( gps ) which are functions of the three - momentum transfer of the virtual photon in the vcs process .",
    "the number of independent gps reduces to six , if charge - conjugation invariance is imposed @xcite .",
    "predictions for the generalized polarizabilities of the nucleon have been obtained in various frameworks ( for an overview , see ref .",
    "the invariant amplitude consists of a bethe - heitler piece , where the real photon is emitted by the initial or final electrons , and the vcs contribution ( see fig .  [ fig : diagrams ] ) , @xmath5    in the following we will be concerned with the invariant amplitude for vcs , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the polarization vector of the virtual photon ( @xmath8 ) , and where use of current conservation has been made . in the center - of - mass system , using the coulomb gauge for the final real photon , the transverse ( longitudinal ) part of @xmath9 for the nucleon can be expressed in terms of eight ( four ) independent structures @xcite , @xmath10 where the functions @xmath11 depend on three kinematical variables , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "for the spin zero case only one longitudinal and two transverse structures are required @xcite .    extending the method of gell - mann and goldberger @xcite to vcs , model - independent predictions for the functions @xmath11 were obtained in @xcite .",
