    "thermodynamics was the great product of nineteenth century physics ; it is epitomised by the concept that there is an upper bound on the efficiency of any thermodynamic machine , known as the carnot limit .",
    "this concept survived the quantum revolution with little more than a scratch ; at present few physicists believe that a quantum machine can produce a significant amount of work at an efficiency exceeding the carnot limit .",
    "however , carnot s limit is only achievable for vanishing power output .",
    "it was recently observed that quantum mechanics imposes a _",
    "stricter _ upper bound on the efficiency at finite power output@xcite .",
    "this upper bound coincides with that of carnot at vanishing power output , but decays monotonically as one increases the desired power output .",
    "this upper bound was found for two - terminal thermoelectric machines .    in recent years",
    ", there has been a lot of theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite interest in three - terminal thermoelectrics , see fig .  [ fig : three - term ] . in particular",
    ", it is suggested that chiral three - terminal thermoelectrics@xcite could have properties of great interest for efficient power generation .",
    "all these three - terminal systems are quantum versions of traditional thermocouples @xcite , since they have one terminal in contact with a thermal reservoir and two terminals in contact with electronic reservoirs .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : three - term ] .",
    "they turn heat flow from the thermal reservoir into electrical power in the electronic reservoirs , or vice versa .",
    "we refer to such three - terminal systems as _ quantum thermocouples _ , since they are too small to be treated with the usual boltzmann transport theory .",
    "there are two quantum lengthscales which enter into consideration ; the electron s wavelength and its decoherence length . in this work",
    "we will be interested in devices in which the whole thermocouple is much smaller than the decoherence length @xcite .",
    "such thermocouples would typically be larger than the electron wavelength , although they need not be .",
    "the crucial point is that electrons flow elastically ( without changing energy or thermalizing ) through the central region in fig .",
    "[ fig : three - term]a .",
    "this can also be a simple phenomenological model of the system in fig .",
    "[ fig : three - term]c , see section  [ sect : voltage - probe ] . in these systems",
    ", quantum interference effects can have a crucial effect on the physics .",
    "such phase - coherent transport effects are not captured by the usual boltzmann transport theory , but they can be modelled using christen and bttiker s nonlinear scattering theory @xcite , in the cases where it is acceptable to treat electron - electron interactions at the mean - field level .",
    "such three - terminal systems are about the simplest self - contained quantum machines .",
    "there is a heat current into the system from reservoir m , @xmath0 , but no electrical current from reservoir m ,",
    "@xmath3 see fig .",
    "[ fig : phenomenological ] .",
    "if reservoir l and r are at the same temperature @xmath4 , and reservoir m is hotter at @xmath5 , we can use the heat flow @xmath0 to drive an electrical current from l to r. if this electrical current flows against a potential difference , then the system turns heat into electrical power , and so is acting as a thermodynamic _ heat - engine_. alternatively , we can make the system act as a _ refrigerator _",
    ", by applying a bias which drives a current from l to r , and `` sucks '' heat out of a reservoir m ( peltier cooling ) taking it to a lower temperature than reservoirs l and r , @xmath6 .    in this work",
    ", we consider arbitrary phase - coherent three - terminal quantum systems that fall in to the category described by christen and buttiker s nonlinear scattering theory @xcite .",
    "we find upper bounds on such a system s efficiency as a heat - engine or a refrigerator at finite power output .",
    "we will show that these bounds coincide with those of two - terminal quantum systems considered in ref .",
    "[ ] , irrespective of whether the three - terminal system s time - reversal symmetry is broken ( by an external magnetic field ) or not .",
    "thus our bound applies equally to normal and _ chiral _ thermoelectrics@xcite .",
    "when the system acts as a heat - engine ( or energy - harvester@xcite ) , the input is the heat current out of the thermal reservoir ( reservoir m ) , @xmath0 , and the output is the electrical power generated by the system , @xmath7 .",
    "this power flows into a load attached between reservoirs l and r ; this load could be a motor turning electrical work into mechanical work , or some sort of work storage device .",
    "the heat - engine ( eng ) efficiency is defined as @xmath8 this never exceeds carnot s limit , @xmath9 where we recall that @xmath5 .",
    "carnot s limit is the upper bound on efficiency , but it is only achievable at zero power output .    for the refrigerator",
    "the situation is reversed , the load is replaced by a power supply , and the system absorbs power , @xmath10 , from that supply . the cooling power output is the heat current out of the colder reservoir ( reservoir m ) , @xmath0 .",
    "thus the refrigerator ( fri ) efficiency or _ coefficient of performance _ ( cop ) is , @xmath11 this never exceeds carnot s limit , @xmath12 where we have @xmath6 ( which is the opposite of heat - engine ) .",
    "carnot s limit is the upper bound on efficiency , but it is only achievable at zero cooling power .",
    "bekenstein @xcite and pendry @xcite independently noted that there is an upper bound on the heat that can flow through a single transverse mode . as a result ,",
    "the heat that any wave ( electron , photon , etc ) can carry away from reservoir @xmath13 at temperature @xmath14 through a cross - section carrying @xmath15 transverse modes is @xmath16 where the number of transverse modes is of order the cross - section in units of the wavelength of the particles carrying the heat .",
    "this bekenstein - pendry bound was observed experimentally in point - contacts@xcite , and recently verified to high accuracy in quantum hall edge - states @xcite .",
    "[ ] pointed out that this upper bound on heat flow , must place a similar upper bound on the power generated by a heat - engine ( since the efficiency is always finite ) .",
    "those works used the nonlinear version of landauer scattering theory @xcite to find this upper bound on the power generated , which they called the quantum bound ( qb ) , since its originates from the wavelike nature of electrons in quantum mechanics .",
    "it takes the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 .",
    "[ ] then calculated the upper bound on an heat engines efficiency for given power generation @xmath7 and showed that it is a monotonically decaying function of @xmath19 .",
    "there is no closed form algebraic expression for this upper bound at arbitrary @xmath19 , it is given by the solution of a transcendental equation .",
    "however , for @xmath20 one has @xmath21 with the next term in the expansion being of order @xmath22 . in the limit of maximum power generation , @xmath23 ,",
    "the upper bound onefficiency is @xmath24 refs .",
    "[ ] calculated similar expressions for the upper bound on refrigerator efficiency as a function of cooling power . in this case",
    ", the upper bound is found to be half the bekenstein - pendry bound on heat - flow .",
    "again , the maximum efficiency equals that of carnot for cooling powers much less than the bekenstein - pendry bound , and decays monotonically as one increases the desired cooling power towards its upper limit .    in the naive classical limit of vanishing wavelength compared to system size , one has @xmath25 and so the quantum bound @xmath26 and @xmath27 become irrelevant ( they go to infinity ) .",
    "so in this limit , it appears that one can achieve carnot efficiency for any power output .",
    "however quantum mechanics says that this is not the case , that for any power output that is a significant fraction of @xmath26 or @xmath27 , the upper bound on efficiency is lower than carnot efficiency .",
    "this efficiency bound was derived for two - terminal quantum systems , here we will show that exactly the same bounds apply to three - terminal quantum systems .",
    "a sketch of a system for which the voltage - probe model discussed in section  [ sect : voltage - probe ] is correct .",
    "the role of reservoir m is played by the island which is large enough that any electron entering it thermalizes at temperature @xmath28 before escaping back into the dot .",
    "the electro - neutrality of the island ensures that @xmath1 in the steady - state .",
    "however , the fact the island exchanges heat ( in the form of photons or phonons ) with a thermal reservoir , means that it can still deliver heat to the three - terminal system .",
    "the island is in a steady - state at temperature @xmath28 , for which the heat flow out of the island due to electrons , @xmath0 , equals the heat flow into the island due to photons ( or phonons ) . ]      here we discuss two examples of systems for which the bounds we derive here apply .",
    "the first example is the _ chiral thermoelectric _ sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : three - term]b , as discussed in refs .",
    "[ ] . this is a three - teminal system exposed to such a strong external magnetic field that the electron flow only occurs via edge - states ( all bulk states are localized by the magnetic field ) .",
    "these edge - state are chiral , which means they circulate in a preferred direction in the scattering region ( anticlockwise in fig .",
    "[ fig : three - term]b ) , this is an intriguing situation for a heat - engine in which one wants to generate electrical power by driving a flow of electrons from reservoir l ( at lower chemical potential ) to reservoir r ( at higher chemical potential ) .",
    "the b - field alone generates an electron flow directly from l to r _ without _ a corresponding direct electron flow from r to l. thus it would seem plausible that one could take advantage of this , with a suitable choice of reservoir m and of the central scattering region to achieve higher efficiencies than in a two - terminal device ( where every flow from l to r has a corresponding flow from r to l ) .",
    "unfortunately , our general solution for a three - terminal system will show that the upper bound on efficiency at given power output is independent of the external magnetic field , so it is the same for chiral or non - chiral systems .",
    "the second example is the quantum thermocouple sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : three - term]c . here",
    ", the third terminal ( reservoir m ) supplies heat in the form of photons ( or phonons ) .",
    "such systems have been considered using microscopic models of the photon flow @xcite , however here we instead use a phenomenological argument to replace the reservoir of photons sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : three - term]c by the reservoir of electrons sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : three - term]a .",
    "this is the `` voltage probe '' model @xcite , in which inelastic scattering ( such as electrons scattering from photons ) is modelled by a reservoir of electrons whose chemical potential is chosen such that that on average every electron that escapes the system into that reservoir is replaced by one coming into the system from that reservoir , so @xmath1 .",
    "[ fig : phenomenological ] shows a system for which this voltage probe model is correct .",
    "the island is large enough that any electron entering it thermalizes at temperature @xmath28 before escaping back into the dot .",
    "since the island is in a steady - state at temperature @xmath28 , the heat flow out of the island due to electrons must equal the heat flow into the island due to photons .",
    "however , one can also argue phenomenologically that the same model is a simplified description of the system sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : three - term]c .",
    "this phenomenological model treats the exchange of a photon between the dot and reservoir m , as the replacement of an electron in the dot which has the dot s energy distribution , with an electron which has reservoir m s energy distribution .",
    "of course , this is not the most realistic model of electron - photon interactions . in particular",
    ", it assumes that each electron entering from reservoir l or r either escapes into one of those two reservoirs without any inelastic scattering from the photon - field , or it escapes after undergoing so many scatterings from the photon - field that it has _ completely _ thermalized with the photon - field . as such",
    ", this model does not capture the physics of electrons that undergo one or two inelastic scatterings from the photon - field before escaping into reservoir l or r. at this simplistic level of modelling , nothing would change if it were phonons rather than photons coming from reservoir m. while this voltage probe model has been successfully used to understand the basics of many inelastic effects in nanostructures , it should not be considered a replacement for a proper microscopic theory ( see e.g.  refs .",
    "[ ] for a discussion of how the voltage probe model fails to capture aspects of inelastic scattering in ultra - clean nanostructures ) .",
    "one should be cautious about applying results for a system of the type in fig .",
