    "transport properties of double quantum dots ( dqds ) have recently attracted much interest . @xcite since the behavior of double quantum dots resembles the behavior of molecules , dqds are frequently called _ artificial molecules _ , and are thus considered as ideal systems to study the fundamental many - body interactions between single electrons and spins .",
    "@xcite double quantum dots exhibit a variety of interesting effects , such as for example current rectification due to the pauli spin blockade , @xcite negative differential conductance , @xcite formation of molecular states , @xcite spin pumping , @xcite kondo effect , @xcite etc .",
    "furthermore , double quantum dots are also interesting for future applications in quantum computing .",
    "@xcite in addition , when the leads are ferromagnetic , transport properties of the system strongly depend on the relative orientation of the magnetizations of electrodes , leading to the tunnel magnetoresistance ( tmr ) effect , spin accumulation , exchange field , etc .",
    "@xcite    the problem of spin - polarized transport properties has been so far mainly addressed in the case of single quantum dots .",
    "@xcite in particular , in the strong coupling regime it was shown that the kondo peak becomes split when the magnetic configuration changes from the antiparallel to parallel one , and that this splitting can be compensated upon applying external magnetic field .",
    "@xcite in the weak coupling regime , on the other hand , the parity effect of the linear response tmr was predicted @xcite and the zero - bias anomaly was found in the differential conductance when magnetic moments of the leads form an antiparallel configuration .",
    "@xcite in this paper we extend the existing theoretical studies and consider transport through coherent double quantum dots weakly coupled to external ferromagnetic leads .",
    "we note that spin - dependent transport properties of dqds have been analyzed very recently in a few theoretical papers .",
    "@xcite the considerations were however limited to either first - order tunneling or the coulomb blockade regime . in particular , in ref .",
    "[ ] the formation of a pure triplet state was predicted , ref .",
    "[ ] deals with transport in the deep coulomb blockade regime , while ref .",
    "[ ] presents a detailed analysis of sequential transport in the case of non - collinearly polarized leads .",
    "the goal of this paper is thus to analyze the transport properties of double quantum dots coupled to collinear ferromagnetic leads in the full weak coupling regime , i.e. including sequential , cotunneling and cotunneling - assisted sequential processes .",
    "furthermore , we also analyze the effect of different geometries of the double dots on transport , in particular , the cases of dqds coupled in series , in parallel , as well as t - shaped double quantum dots are considered .",
    "the comparison of numerical results obtained for different geometries may in principle help in determining the system s geometry , which may be of importance in discussing and understanding experimental results , especially on self - assembled quantum dots .",
    "the present analysis is based on the real - time diagrammatic technique which consists in a perturbation expansion of the density matrix of the system under consideration , and the relevant operators , with respect to the coupling to external leads .",
    "the advantage of using the real - time diagrammatic technique is that it takes into account the effects of the exchange field and the renormalization of the dot levels in a fully systematic way . in particular ,",
    "in the case of asymmetric dqds coupled in series , we consider transport in the pauli spin blockade regime and show that the leakage current in the blockade region results from cotunneling and cotunneling - assisted sequential tunneling processes . as far as the shot noise is concerned , we show that the noise is super - poissonian in the coulomb blockade regime and drops to sub - poissonian value in the sequential tunneling regime , where the fano factor approaches one half .",
    "this behavior is observed for parallel and serial dqd s geometries . in turn , for t - shaped double quantum dots , we find a large super - poissonian shot noise due to increased occupation of the decoupled dot .",
    "we also analyze the tmr effect and find its strong dependence on the transport regime and number of electrons in the dqd in the ground state . for dqds coupled in series and in parallel the tmr takes the values ranging from around a half of the julliere tmr to its full value , @xcite whereas for t - shaped dqds the tmr may be enhanced above the julliere value .    the systems considered in this paper may be realized experimentally for example in lateral and vertical semiconductor quantum dots @xcite or single wall metallic carbon nanotubes with top gate electrodes .",
    "@xcite the latter systems are of particular interest because , by tuning the gates , it is possible to change the charge on each dot separately . unfortunately , the aforementioned experiments concerned only dqds coupled to nonmagnetic leads",
    ". there are several experimental realizations of single quantum dots attached to ferromagnetic leads , @xcite while experimental data on spin - polarized transport through double quantum dots are lacking .",
    "we thus believe that the results presented in this paper will be of assistance in discussing future experiments .",

    "iv we present and discuss the numerical results for double quantum dots coupled in series . in this section",

    "[ fig:2](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the conductance in the parallel configuration is generally larger than that in the antiparallel configuration .",

    "[ fig:3](a ) , while fig .",
    "[ fig:3](b ) presents the first - order tmr , @xmath83 . intuitively , the tmr is a measure of the system s transport properties change when the magnetic configuration switches from the parallel to the antiparallel one .",

    "[ fig:2 ] , one can easily identify the different transport regimes .",
    "furthermore , by comparing the total and sequential tmr , one can immediately see that cotunneling modifies the tmr mainly in the low bias voltage regime , i.e. in the coulomb blockade regime and in the regime where sequential tunneling is suppressed due to the absence of levels in the energy window provided by transport voltage . in order to discuss and see more clearly the behavior of the tmr on applied voltages , in fig .",

    "it can be seen that off resonance the current is mainly dominated by cotunneling .",
    "on the other hand , on resonance the sequential processes dominate current , while cotunneling only slightly affects the conductance , leading to renormalization of the dqd levels and , thus , slightly shifting the position of the conductance peaks , see fig .  [ fig:4](a ) .",
    "interestingly , the second - order processes have a rather large impact on the linear tmr shown in fig .  [ fig:4](b ) .",
    "first of all , the linear response tmr exhibits a strong dependence on the gate voltage , i.e. on the number of electrons in the double quantum dot .",
    "when the dqd is either empty or fully occupied , the tmr is given by the julliere value , @xmath87 .",
    "@xcite this is due to the fact that in those transport regimes the current is driven by elastic cotunneling processes which do not affect the dqd state in any way .",
    "thus , as far as the tmr is concerned , the system behaves as a single ferromagnetic tunnel junction .",
    "@xcite however , in the coulomb blockade regions , the tmr becomes generally suppressed due to the presence of inelastic cotunneling which introduces spin - flip processes in the system . the dotted line in fig .",

    "the results for the linear response tmr are comparable to those obtained within the sequential tunneling approximation only on resonance , where sequential processes dominate , while off resonance they are completely unreliable , see fig .",

    "more and more charge states start to participate in transport which gives rise to the corresponding steps in the current - voltage characteristics , and peaks in the differential conductance .",

    "moreover , we also note that in the coulomb blockade regime , @xmath91 mev , the shot noise becomes super - poissonian ( @xmath99 ) and drops to the sub - poissonian value ( @xmath100 ) at the threshold for sequential tunneling , see fig .",

    "@xcite    finally , to make the present analysis self - contained , we also show the bias and gate voltage dependence of the total fano factor for the parallel and antiparallel magnetic configuration , see fig .  [ fig:6](a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",

    ", it was proposed that non - zero current in the pauli blockade is associated with spin - flip processes induced by hyperfine interaction .",
    "@xcite in the following , we show that the leakage current results just from the interplay between different intrinsic tunneling processes driving the current",
    ". the hyperfine interaction , or coupling to a phonon bath , may , of course , increase the leakage , but is not necessary for the observation of a finite current in the pauli spin blockade regime .",
    "when the dqds levels are detuned , @xmath104 , and once the first and second dot become singly occupied , the current may be suppressed in some range of the bias voltage .",

    "@xcite the pauli spin blockade may be lifted when the applied bias voltage admits another ( exited ) charge states to participate in transport . on the other hand ,",
    "when the voltage is reversed , it is energetically allowed that the electron from the first dot tunnels to the left lead and then another electron from the right lead enters the dqd , lifting the pauli spin blockade .",

    "first of all , one can see that the transport characteristics are asymmetric with respect to the bias reversal .",
    "this is associated with the fact that by detuning the dqds levels the symmetry of transition rates between the left and right leads has been broken .",
    "furthermore , for positive bias voltage the current is suppressed in a broad range of the bias voltage ( @xmath106 ) due to the full occupation of the triplet states , while for negative bias the pauli spin blockade is lifted .",

    "the suppression of the sequential current is generally governed by the ratio @xmath108 .",
    "@xcite when @xmath109 , the occupation of the two - electron triplet states approaches unity and the first - order current becomes fully blocked .",
    "however , the second - order processes are still allowed , leading to a finite leakage current in the spin blockade regime .",
    "one can distinguish different contributions coming from cotunneling :    \\(i ) the double - barrier elastic second - order processes which contribute directly to the current .",
    "\\(ii ) the double - barrier spin - flip cotunneling which contributes to the current and reduces the occupation of the triplet state , this way opening the dqd for the sequential tunneling .",
    "\\(iii ) the single - barrier spin - flip cotunneling which does not contribute directly to the current but flips the spin in the dqd and allows the sequential processes to occur .    as a consequence , in the pauli spin blockade regime the current flows due to cotunneling and spin - flip cotunneling - assisted sequential tunneling .",
    "the key role is played by the spin - flip processes which decrease the occupation of the two - electron triplet states and lead to a finite occupation of singlet states .",
    "the importance of the spin - flip processes in explanation of the finite leakage current has been invoked in ref .  [ ] .",
    "the leakage was there associated with spin - flip processes induced by hyperfine interaction through the overhauser effect . here",
    ", we show that the leakage results just from the interplay between different tunneling processes , i.e. just from the pure nature of tunneling processes .",
    "we also note that the effects of cotunneling are rather independent of the material from which the dots are built , unlike the overhauser field .",
    "@xcite thus , for example , in gaas dqds the leakage current in the pauli spin blockade would be associated with both cotunneling and hyperfine contributions , while in carbon nanotube dqds it would be mainly due to cotunneling .",
    "furthermore , as shown in experiments by ono and tarucha , @xcite who studied the dependence of the leakage current on the applied magnetic field , the hyperfine interaction starts to play a role at certain finite in - plane magnetic fields , at which the nuclei become polarized , leading to a sudden jump of the leakage current as a function of magnetic field .",
    "this suggests that the main contribution to the current in the spin blockade regime in the absence of magnetic field may come from cotunneling . in the weak coupling regime ,",
    "typical values of the dot - lead coupling strength @xmath38 are of the order of @xmath110ev , @xcite which gives the leakage current of the order of @xmath111 pa ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] ) , in agreement with experimental results .",
    "@xcite finally , we notice that to explain the jump in the leakage current when sweeping magnetic field , besides cotunneling , one also has to include the hyperfine interaction .",
    "nevertheless , this goes beyond the scope of the present paper .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] we present the logarithmic dependence of the sequential and total currents in the parallel configuration on the hopping parameter @xmath20 .",
    "it is clearly visible that for @xmath112 , the sequential current is smaller by two orders of magnitude than the total current . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath113 , the sequential current becomes of the same order as the total current , but still , noticeably , the total current is larger than that calculated using only the first - order tunneling processes .",
    "the saturation of the two currents for @xmath114 , see fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] , is associated with a finite temperature .",
    "however , because sequential tunneling depends exponentially on temperature while cotunneling only algebraically , at lower @xmath115 the difference between the two currents would be even more pronounced .",
    "the dependence of the current in the antiparallel configuration is qualitatively similar to the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] .",
    "we also note that generally the above mentioned mechanism responsible for the leakage current does not depend on whether the leads are made of ferromagnetic or nonmagnetic material .",
    "the tmr as a function of the bias voltage is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig:7](b ) .",
    "one can see that the tmr calculated using the first - order processes and that calculated taking into account cotunneling are generally similar , except for the pauli spin blockade regime . in this transport regime",
    "the sequential tmr is much overestimated . to understand this behavior we note again that the blockade results from the full occupation of dqd s triplet states .",
    "the probability is equally distributed between the three components of the triplet in the parallel configuration . however , in the antiparallel configuration , it turns out that the charge is mainly accumulated in the @xmath116 component of the triplet . as a consequence , in the parallel configuration all the three components of the triplet",
    "participate in transport , while in the antiparallel configuration only one . because the sequential current in the blockade regime is mainly associated with thermal fluctuations , the difference in the number of states relevant for transport leads to large sequential tmr in blockade regime .",
    "this difference also gives rise to the corresponding difference between fano factors calculated in the sequential tunneling approximation , see the dotted curves in fig .",
    "[ fig:7](c ) .",
    "the shot noise is then super - poissonian and larger in the parallel configuration .",
    "however , as pointed above , the leakage current in the pauli spin blockade regime is due to cotunneling and cotunneling - assisted sequential tunneling processes .",
    "the total current flows not only due to thermal fluctuations but due to correlated tunneling through virtual states of the dqd .",
    "this fact generally decreases the current fluctuations and the difference between the two magnetic configurations . as a result ,",
    "the total tmr and fano factor become suppressed as compared to the sequential tunneling results , see fig .  [ fig:7](b ) and ( c ) , respectively .",
    "in addition , we also notice that , irrespective of the magnetic configuration of the system , the shot noise is super - poissonian in the spin blockade regime and drops to sub - poissonian value out of the blockade regime , see fig .",
    "[ fig:7](c ) .",
    "the super - poissonian shot noise is generally due to bunching of spin - flip cotunneling and cotunneling - assisted sequential tunneling processes .",
    "in this section we analyze the spin - polarized transport through double quantum dots coupled in parallel .",
    "this geometry can be realized by setting @xmath117 , for @xmath118 and @xmath119 , see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "we note that in the case of negligible hopping between the two quantum dots , @xmath120 , the behavior of the dqd system resembles that of a single multi - level quantum dot .",
    "the problem of spin - dependent transport through multi - level quantum dots has been addressed very recently in ref .  [ ] and will not be considered here .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] we present the density plots of the differential conductance and fano factor in the parallel configuration as well as of the tmr effect as a function of the bias and gate voltages .",
    "the behavior of the conductance and the shot noise in the antiparallel configuration is qualitatively similar as in the parallel configuration , therefore , it is not shown here .",
    "the information about the difference in transport in the two magnetic alignments is contained in the tmr , whose magnitude reflects the asymmetry in tunneling processes when the leads are parallel or antiparallel to each other .",
    "the differential conductance , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:9](a ) , displays characteristic coulomb diamonds .",
    "because the internal energy structure of the dqd is generally the same as in the case of dqd coupled in series , the differential conductances are qualitatively similar , see figs .",
    "[ fig:2](a ) and [ fig:9](a ) .",
    "the main difference is that in the case of parallel dqds the level of each dot is coupled both to the left and right leads , which generally results in an enhanced conductance for parallel dqds as compared to dqds coupled in series .",
    "similarly the tmr shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:9](b ) , its bias and gate voltage dependence is only slightly modified as compared to fig .",
    "[ fig:3](a ) .",
    "again , the linear tmr exhibits a strong dependence on the occupation number of the dqd , with tmr given by the julliere formula for empty and fully occupied double quantum dot , and is much suppressed in other transport regimes due to spin - flip cotunneling . in the coulomb blockade regime , the transport properties",
    "are mainly conditioned by the spin - flip cotunneling , which gives a dominant contribution to the current .",
    "furthermore , the bunching of spin - flip cotunneling in the coulomb blockade regime leads to super - poissonian shot noise , see fig .",
    "[ fig:9](c ) .",
    "the super - poissonian shot noise is however more pronounced in coulomb blockade regimes with an odd number of electrons in the double dot . on the other hand , for voltages above the threshold for sequential tunneling ,",
    "the shot noise becomes sub - poissonian , with the fano factor approaching @xmath121 .",
    "summing up , we notice that generally in the weak coupling regime the effect of different geometries of the double dot system leads only to qualitative difference in transport properties .",
    "the main difference is in the magnitude of conductance  for parallel dqds it is roughly two times larger than for serial dqds .",
    "this is contrary to the strong coupling regime where , for example , in the parallel geometry the orbital kondo phenomenon arises due to the interference effects , while for dqds coupled in series the orbital kondo effect is destroyed .",
    "@xcite finally , we also note that in the case of detuned levels , @xmath122 , transport properties of double quantum dots coupled in parallel are qualitatively similar to those of single multi - level quantum dots . @xcite",
    "an interesting situation occurs when only one of the two quantum dots is coupled to external leads , while the other one is decoupled . in such t - shaped systems transport takes place through the molecular states of the double dot , although only the first dot is directly coupled to the leads .",
    "this may lead to new transport behavior , especially to a large super - poissonian shot noise and an enhanced tmr , as we show in the sequel .",

    "[ fig:10 ] we present the current , differential conductance , the tmr and the fano factor as a function of the bias voltage for the case when the first dot is coupled to the leads while the second dot is decoupled .",
    "spin - dependent transport through single quantum dots have already been extensively studied .",
    "however , the hopping @xmath20 between the two dots may modify the transport properties significantly , giving rise to novel behavior .",
    "first of all , we note that due to the finite @xmath20 , transport takes place through molecular states of the double dot .",
    "this in turn leads to additional steps in the i - v curves and peaks in the differential conductance , see fig .",
    "[ fig:10](a ) , as compared to tunneling through one single - level quantum dots , where for spin - degenerate level the current exhibits only two steps .",
    "the difference between the currents in the parallel and antiparallel configurations gives rise to the tmr which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:10](b ) .",
    "the tmr displays an oscillatory - like behavior with increasing the bias voltage .",
    "in addition , at the threshold for sequential tunneling , the tmr becomes increased above the julliere tmr .",
    "@xcite this result is rather counterintuitive , as the julliere tmr is characteristic of a single ferromagnetic tunnel junction and one would expect that an additional object ( quantum dot ) between the leads should decrease the tmr .",
    "this was shown for single quantum dots with spin degenerate levels and symmetric couplings to the leads where the tmr was found to take at most the julliere value .",
    "@xcite in principle , the tmr can be enhanced above the julliere value when only one spin component of the dot takes part in transport .",
    "such spin selection may be achieved upon applying an external magnetic field or due to finite exchange interaction between spins in the dot . @xcite in the case of t - shaped dqds , we find that the enhancement of the tmr is associated with increased occupation of the second dot in the antiparallel configuration , as compared to the parallel .",
    "because the second dot is decoupled from the leads , this increases the difference between the current in the two configurations , yielding the tmr larger than the julliere value .",
    "in addition , finite occupation of the decoupled dot also leads to large current fluctuations , as the rate for tunneling between the second dot is much slower than that for tunneling between the first dot and the leads .",
    "this in turn gives rise to super - poissonian shot noise , as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig:10](c ) .",
    "the super - poissonian shot noise is present in both magnetic configurations .",
    "it is also slightly larger in the parallel configuration than in the antiparallel one , which is due to an additional contribution to the noise coming from spin - dependent tunneling between the dots and the leads .",
    "@xcite we note that the super - poissonian shot noise in t - shaped dots has also been reported in the case of nonmagnetic leads . @xcite",
    "the two dots were however rather weakly coupled to each other so that no molecular states were formed , contrary to the case considered here .",
    "the enhancement of the tmr above the julliere value and the large super - poissonian shot noise are present approximately at the threshold for sequential tunneling . in this transport regime the current is mainly mediated through the charge states of the decoupled dot .",
    "the aforementioned effects should therefore become washed out if there were a finite coupling between the second dot and the leads .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:10](b ) and ( c ) where we depict the tmr and fano factor in the parallel configuration calculated for @xmath133 ( see the dotted curves in fig .  [ fig:10 ] ) .",
    "the tmr larger than the julliere tmr accompanied by super - poissonian shot noise is thus an indication that transport takes place through quantum dot coupled to another dot , which is not connected to the leads directly .",
    "figure  [ fig:11 ] displays the bias dependence of the current , tmr and the fano factor calculated in the case when at equilibrium the second dot is fully occupied while the first dot is empty . at low bias voltage ,",
    "the system is in the coulomb blockade and the double dot is occupied with two electrons in the second dot with unit probability .",
    "the current flows then only due to elastic cotunneling processes .",
    "this gives rise to the julliere tmr and poissonian shot noise , see fig .",
    "[ fig:11](b ) and ( c ) .",
    "with increasing the bias voltage , close to the threshold for sequential tunneling , the occupation of the second dot is slightly lowered at the cost of a finite occupation of another states .",
    "this opens the system for the cotunneling - assisted sequential and sequential tunneling processes .",
    "nevertheless , because the double dot is still mainly occupied by two electrons on the decoupled dot , this gives rise to extremely large current fluctuations and fano factors , see fig .",

    "we have also discussed the main differences in transport characteristics corresponding to different dqds geometries , which may be helpful in determining the geometry of coupled quantum dots in experiments .    in the case of double quantum dots coupled in series , we have found an interesting dependence of the tmr on the occupation number of the dqd .",
