    "however , observations show that considerably more massive stars exist , and their formation mechanism remains uncertain .",
    "in this paper we present two new mechanisms that allow accretion onto massive stars to overcome the radiation pressure barrier and continue to higher masses .",
    "first , we perform 3d self - gravitational radiation hydrodynamic adaptive mesh refinement simulations of the collapse of massive protostellar cores , starting from both quiescent and turbulent initial conditions .",
    "we find that sufficiently massive stars create radiation - driven bubbles in accreting flows , but these bubbles become unstable and collapse due to a radiation rayleigh - taylor instability .",

    "we refine any cell that is within 32 cells of a sink particle , where the gradient of radiation energy density satisfies @xmath35 , or where the cell violates the jeans condition for self - gravitational stability @xcite .",
    "the results of the @xmath21 @xmath1 and @xmath22 @xmath1 runs are qualitatively very similar , so for simplicity we only discuss them together .",
    "the accretion process appears to pass through three phases . during the first phase , when @xmath36 @xmath1 , the accretion flow is smooth and there are no obvious effects from radiation pressure .",
    "low angular momentum gas accretes directly onto the star , and higher angular momentum gas falls into a keplerian accretion disk . at @xmath37 @xmath1",
    "the accretion luminosity is dominant , but thereafter it becomes a relatively minor component of the total energy output .",
    "the second phase begins at @xmath38 @xmath1 , when the star is luminous enough for radiation pressure to start repelling gas .",
    "this leads to the formation of radiation - driven bubbles above and below the accretion disk , as shown in figure [ bubblephase ] , first panel",
    ". the bubbles are asymmetric above and below the accretion disk and with respect to the polar axis , an effect that earlier single - quadrant 2d simulations could not model .",
    "the asymmetry is the result of a positive feedback loop .",
    "if the radiation bubble has expanded farthest in a certain direction , then there is less gas above the star in that direction . as a result",
    ", that direction represents the path of minimum optical depth out of the core and radiation is collimated towards it . since more radiation is flowing in that direction , there is a greater radiation pressure force , which in turn causes the bubble to expand even faster . at no point during the bubble phase",
    "does accretion stop , although it does become clumpy and erratic . infalling gas that reaches a radiation bubble travels around its edge until it reaches the equatorial plane and the accretion disk .",
    "the disk itself is unaffected by the radiation pressure due to its high optical depth .",
    "this phase lasts @xmath39 yr .",
    "the transition to the third phase of accretion happens at a mass of @xmath40 @xmath1 , when the bubble becomes unstable and begins to collapse .",
    "the collapse of the bubble appears to occur when the bubble walls stop accelerating away from the star , so that there is a net gravitational force towards the star within the walls .",
    "the instability leads to ripples in the bubble walls , and eventually to gas breaking through into the bubble .",
    "this is shown in figure [ bubblephase ] , second panel .",
    "physically , this process is easy to understand as rayleigh - taylor instability : the gas is a heavy fluid , and radiation is in effect a light fluid . once the local gravity is such that the radiation is below the gas , instability naturally results .",
    "however , the instability seems to begin with a large wavelength mode passing through the pole , in which the entire shell ripples .",
    "this mode can not exist in an axisymmetric simulation , which is probably why previous work has not seen it .    once enough gas has flooded in",
    ", the bubble effectively disappears , what is left is a remnant of the bubble wall .",
    "after this point , gas that falls towards the star is deflected to the side by the radiation field until it reaches the dense wall .",
    "the gas then flows along the wall into the accretion disk , and is able to accrete .",
    "this configuration is shown in figure [ bubblephase ] , third panel . to the point",
    "we have evolved the simulations thus far , this appears to be the final configuration of the system .",
    "however , it is possible that there may be more episodes of bubble formation and destruction . at the time of this writing ,",
    "the simulations have reached a mass of @xmath41 @xmath1 , considerably larger than the @xmath42 @xmath1 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* yorke & sonnhalter ( 2002 ) ) found for their calculations with gray radiative transfer .",
    "our simulations are continuing to determine an upper mass limit .",
    "our turbulent run shows results qualitatively quite similar to our queiscent runs . in the early stages of the simulation , a star with a disk around",
    "the orientation of the disk varies in time , as the angular momentum of the accreting gas changes in time due to the turbulence . at @xmath43 @xmath1",
    ", a bubble grows around the star .",
    "we have evolved the star to a mass of @xmath44 @xmath1 as of this writing .",
    "the star is still in the bubble phase , and the bubble shows no signs of collapsing yet , as it showed by this mass in the quiescent cases . the bubbles above and below the accretion disk have also grown to a diameters of almost @xmath45 au , larger than they became in the quiescent case .",
    "we believe the changes in bubble evolution are probably due to a combination of the change in the normalization of the density profile ( @xmath30 @xmath1 versus @xmath21 @xmath1 within 0.1 pc ) and to the turbulence , both of which reduce the effective radial infall velocity at the start of the bubble phase and thus allow the expansion of the bubble to accelerate for longer times .",
    "the mean accretion rate in the simulation thus far is @xmath46 @xmath1 yr@xmath47 . because our initial conditions are not in virial balance on small scales , this is slightly larger than the @xmath48 @xmath1 yr@xmath47 that ( * ? ? ?",
    "* mckee & tan ( 2003 ) ) predict for our initial density profile .",
    "we do not see any evidence of fragmentation to form many stars , as found by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* dobbs , bonnell , & clark ( 2005 ) ) in simulations with fairly similar initial conditions .",
    "we hypothesize that the different outcome stems from our more detailed treatment of the radiation .",
    "dobbs  use either an isothermal or a barotropic equation of state , and find that the barotropic equation of state reduces their number of fragments from tens to a few .",
    "this points to the importance of heating in determining whether fragmentation occurs .",
    "however , even a barotropic equation of state misses the vast majority of the heating .",
    "since neither our simulations nor those of dobbs  resolve the protostellar radius , most of the energy released by the infalling gas is released at sub - grid scales , in the final plunge onto the stellar surface .",
    "our method captures this energy , by including the accretion luminosity in the energy output by our sink particle , but a barotropic equation of state omits it . in our simulations , the high accretion luminosity that results from the high pressure in the protostellar",
    "core heats the gas within @xmath49 au of the star ( where dobbs  get fragmentation ) to hundreds of k in only a thousand years .",
    "this is shorter than the free - fall time of @xmath50 yr at 1000 au , so the heating prevents fragmentation .",
    "we also consider the effects of protostellar outflows on the accretion process ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* krumholz , mckee , & klein 2005 ) for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "* beuther , schilke , & geuth ( 2004 ) ) report interferometric measurements showing outflows from massive protostars with collimation factors of @xmath51 up to @xmath52 .",
    "they conclude that high and low mass outflows have similar collimation factors , typically @xmath53 .",
    "( the collimation factor is the ratio of the outflow s length to its width . )",
    "* richer  ( 2000 ) ) show that the momentum of co outflows driven by massive stars scales with the bolometric luminosity of the source in the same manner as for low mass stars . from these observations ,",
    "the natural conclusion is that low and high mass stellar outflows have a common driving mechanism and similar morphologies .",
    "this analysis suggests that massive protostellar outflows originate near their source stars , inside the stars dust destruction radius . as a result , they should be dust - free when launched .",
    "once the outflowing gas is far enough from the star , grains can begin to grow .",
    "however , the wind density is relatively low and its speed is very high . for a range of possible shapes of the cavity filled by outflowing gas , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* krumholz ) show that the largest grains ejected in the wind from a @xmath2 @xmath1 star at a typical velocity of 1000 km s@xmath47 reach sizes of no more than @xmath54 @xmath55 m before escaping the accreting core .",
    "since the optical depth of grains to radiation both from the star and the envelope obeys @xmath56 , this means that the outflow channel will be quite optically thin up to its cap of swept - up material .",
    "since the surrounding envelope is very optically thick , we expect the outflow cavity to collimate the radiation and carry it away from the accreting gas .    to see how this affects radiation pressure , we compute radiative transfer through envelopes witih and without outflow cavities using the monte carlo code of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* whitney ( 2003a , b ) ) , and then compute radiation pressure forces within the envelope using a ray tracing code .",
    "we find that even in a very low surface density envelope with @xmath57 g @xmath58 , an outflow cavity reduces the radiation pressure force in the equatorial plane by a factor of @xmath59 . at the higher surface densities typical of most massive star forming regions , the collimation is even more effective , and the radiation pressure is reduced by a factor of @xmath60 . since observations show that such outflows are ubiquitous , we expect suggest that radiation pressure is a much less significant barrier to massive star formation than calculations without protostellar outflows have found .",
    "massive star formation by accretion is much easier than previous work suggested . in three dimensions ,",
    "radiation holding up accreting gas is subject to rayleigh - taylor instability .",
    "radiation deflects gas into optically thick fingers that accrete onto the star , while the radiation diffuses out around the compressed gas .",
    "differing initial conditions , including ones with turbulence , do not appear to change this basic evolution .",
    "furthermore , even without this instability , the outflows from massive stars are by themselves very effective at collimating radiation and carrying it away from the accreting gas .",
    "outflows cavities produce order - of - magnitude reductions in the radiation pressure force experienced by inflowing gas , and thus make accretion even easier .",
    "we therefore conclude that radiation pressure can not prevent the formation of massive stars by accretion .",
