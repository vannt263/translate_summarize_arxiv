    "reverberation mapping , observing the degree and nature of the correlation between continuum and emission - line flux variations , is one of the major tools for studying the distribution and kinematics of the gas in the broad line region ( blr ) and to study the central masses of agns ( e.g. , peterson 1993 ; netzer & peterson 1997 ) . at a first approximation reverberation mapping yields a measure for the size of the blr . combining this size with the line profile , which represent the kinematics",
    ", one can estimate the mass of the central source in an agn .",
    "determining this mass is most important for the understanding and modeling of the agns phenomenon .",
    "establishing the relations between the physical properties ( such as blr size , mass of the central source , and the agn luminosity ) of an agns sample will provide us with important information for understanding the characteristics which are common to all agns .    in the past @xmath6 years",
    "about 17 low - luminosity agns ( seyfert  1 galaxies ) have been successfully monitored and produce statistically meaningful blr sizes ( see wandel , peterson , & malkan 1999 , and references therein ) .",
    "best studied among these is the seyfert 1 galaxy , ngc  5548 , which was monitored from the ground for over eight years , and from space for several long periods ( peterson et al .",
    "1999 , and references therein ) .",
    "several other seyfert  1s were observed for periods of order 1 year or less , and nine seyfert 1s were studied over a period of eight years ( peterson et al .",
    "the measured time lags between the emission lines and the continuum light curves in these objects can be interpreted in terms of the delayed response of a spatially - extended blr to a variable , compact source of ionizing radiation . while the observations do not uniquely determine the geometry of the blr , they give its typical size which , for seyfert  1 galaxies , is of the order of light - days to several light - weeks ( @xmath7@xmath8 cm ) .",
    "recent studies have shown that the time lags determined in ngc 5548 for different observing seasons correlate with the seasonal luminosity of the object ( peterson et al .",
    "1999 ) , and have presented evidence for keplerian motions of the blr gas ( peterson & wandel 1999 ) .    while there has been great progress in mapping seyfert 1 s few similar studies of the more luminous agns  the quasars ",
    "have been presented .",
    "there still have been some open questions such as , do quasar emission lines respond to the continuum changes , as seen in seyfert galaxies ? what is the relative amplitude of the response ?",
    "what is the lag of the response , reflecting the light - travel time across the blr ? do quasar blr sizes scale with agns luminosity , and lie on a continuous relation from the faintest seyferts to the bright quasars ?",
    "there are several difficulties when attempting to monitor high - luminosity agns .",
    "quasars have fainter apparent magnitudes , hence one needs larger telescopes and/or much longer integration limes . since quasars variability time scales are longer than seyferts 1 s and their blrs are expected to be an order of magnitude larger than in seyfert 1 s , we need much longer monitoring periods . when monitoring seyfert 1 s one often use the narrow emission lines to intercalibrate the observed spectra , however , in quasars narrow emission lines are very faint ( or not present at all ) and a different relative flux calibration method needs to be exploit .",
    "past attempts to spectrophotometrically monitor quasars have generally suffered from temporal sampling and/or flux calibrations that are not sufficient for the determination of the blr size ( e.g. , zheng 1988 ; prez , penston & moles 1989 ; korista 1991 ; obrien & gondhalekar 1991 ; jackson et al .",
    "1992 ; koratkar et al .",
    "1998 ; wisotzki et  al .",
    "the quasar best studied by iue , 3c273 , has yielded disputed results when different researchers have analyzed similar iue monitoring data sets .",
    "both obrien & harries ( 1991 ) and koratkar & gaskell ( 1991a ) found a measurable and similar lag between continuum and blr variations , while ulrich , courvoisier , & wamsteker ( 1993 ) argued that the line variations reported in the earlier studies were only marginally significant .    as a more definite results on the blr size in quasars",
    "is needed we began two quasars reverberation mapping programs on which we report in this contribution .",
    "the first program is the monitoring of a sub - sample of 28 palomar - green ( pg ) quasars .",
    "the program and its results are described in details by kaspi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and references therein .",
    "here we present the basic concepts and results of this program and discuss the size  mass ",
    "luminosity relations in agns .",
    "the second program of monitoring 11 high - luminosity high - redshift quasars is reported here for the first time and some preliminary results are presented .",
    "in contrast to seyfert 1 galaxies , which were chosen for reverberation mapping mainly because of their variability properties , the quasars in our sample were selected according to their observable properties .",
    "the sample of 28 quasars is drawn from the 114 pg quasars ( schmidt & green 1983 ) .",
    "the pg quasars are well studied objects over the whole electromagnetic spectrum from x - ray to radio ( e.g. , neugebauer et al .",
    "1987 ; kellermann et al . 1989 ; boroson & green 1992 ; brandt , laor , & wills 2000 ) .",
    "many of their observational properties are well known and adding the information about their variability properties and blr sizes will increase our understanding of the agns phenomenon .",
    "we selected objects with northern declination , @xmath9 mag , redshift @xmath10 ( so that the balmer lines can be observed in the optical region ) , and a bright comparison star within 35 of the quasar .",
    "the absolute magnitude range covered by the sample is @xmath11 mag ( using @xmath12 , @xmath13 kms@xmath5mpc@xmath5 , and zero cosmological constant ) and the bolometric luminosity range is @xmath14 ergss@xmath5 .",
    "spectrophotometric observations of the sample were carried out form 1991 march , over a period of 7.5 years , until september 1999 .",
    "we used the wise observatory ( wo ) 1 m telescope to observe the sample once a month ( when the objects are observable ) and the steward observatory ( so ) 2.3 m telescope once every @xmath15 months .",
    "the spectral range is from 4000 to 8000   with spectral resolution of @xmath16  .",
    "the spectrophotometric calibration for each quasar was accomplished by rotating the spectrograph slit to the appropriate position angle so that the nearby bright star was observed simultaneously with the quasar .",
    "a wide slit was used to minimize the effects of atmospheric dispersion .",
    "this technique provides excellent calibration even during poor weather conditions , and accuracies of order 1%2% can easily be archived .    alongside the spectrophotometric monitoring we carried out at the wo 1 m telescope a broad band photometric monitoring in @xmath17 and @xmath18",
    "the 28 quasars in our sample were included in a sample of 45 pg quasars which were monitored monthly to find the variability properties of the pg quasars ( giveon et al .",
    "we used the photometric data ( by means of differential photometry with other stars in each field ) to check on the continuum behavior found in the the spectrophotometric monitoring and to verify that non of our comparison stars are variables to within @xmath02% .",
    "we also used the photometric observations to add additional epochs to the continuum light curves of the quasars .",
    "continuum light curves were extracted at rest wavelength of about 5100   and line light curves of h@xmath19 , h@xmath20 , and h@xmath21 ( where available ) for all objects .",
    "the photometric data were combined into the continuum light curves .",
    "light curves for two quasars are shown in figure  [ light_curves ] .",
    "pg0804 + 761 is our best sampled object with @xmath22 spectroscopic observations and @xmath23 photometric observations .",
    "the light curves of this object clearly show the variations of the three balmer lines to lag the continuum variations .",
    "also they demonstrate how small variations in the continuum light curve smear out in the line light curves  this effect is a result of a stratified blr .",
    "pg1229 + 204 is a more typical example of our sample .",
    "it has @xmath24 spectroscopic observations and @xmath24 photometric observations . in this object",
    "it is hard to identify the time lag by looking at the light curves but the use of cross - correlation is clearly yielding a time lag ( see next section ) .",
    "0.5 cm 1.0cm=11.2 cm -0.05 cm 1.2 cm -0.685 cm",
    "at the end of the 7.5 years monitoring period we find that for 17 objects out of the 28 there are more than 20 spectroscopic observations .",
    "typically there are between 20 to 70 observations for each of these 17 quasars .",
    "the other 11 quasars have less than 10 spectroscopic observations ( the typical number is 5 observations ) which is not adequate sampling for time series analysis . these 11 objects are excluded from further discussion hereafter .",
    "all the 17 quasars with adequate spectroscopic sampling had gone continuum variation which , quantified as @xmath25 , lie in the range of 35%150% for different objects .",
    "all 17 quasars also show line flux variation which follow the continuum variation with an amplitude of about half of the continuum variations ( see figure  [ light_curves ] ) .    in order to determine the time lags of the line light curves relative to the continuum light curves we use two cross correlation methods : one is the interpolated cross - correlation function ( iccf ; gaskell & sparke 1986 ; gaskell & peterson 1987 ; white & peterson 1994 ) where one light curve is interpolated and then it is cross - correlated with the second observed light curve ; then the second light curve is interpolate and cross - correlated with the first observed light curve .",
    "the final iccf is the mean of these two cross - correlation functions .",
    "the second method is the @xmath26-transformed discrete correlation function ( zdcf ) of alexander ( 1997 ) which is an improvement on the discrete correlation function ( dcf ) of edelson & krolik ( 1988 ) .",
    "this method applies fisher s @xmath26 transformation to the correlation coefficients , and uses equal population bins rather than the equal time bins used in the dcf .",
    "the two independent methods are in excellent agreement for our data and in the following analyses only the iccf results are used .",
    "figure  [ ccfs ] demonstrate the cross correlations of two of the line light curves presented in figure  [ light_curves ] with their corresponding continuum . for the purpose of this work we used the centroid of the iccf ( computed from all points within 80% of the iccf peak value ) to define the time lag ( gaskell 1994 and references therein ) .",
    "-0.3 cm 0.8cm=11.5 cm 0.8cm=11.5 cm    to determine the uncertainties in the cross - correlation time lag we used the model - independent fr / rss monte carlo method of peterson et al .",
    "( 1998b ) . in this method ,",
    "each monte carlo simulation is composed of two parts : the first is a `` random subset selection '' ( rss ) procedure which consists of randomly drawing , with replacement , from a light curve of @xmath27 points a new sample of @xmath27 points .",
    "after the @xmath27 points are selected , the redundant selections are removed from the sample such that the temporal order of the remaining points is preserved",
    ". this procedure accounts for the effect that individual data points have on the cross - correlation .",
    "the second part is `` flux randomization '' ( fr ) in which the observed fluxes are altered by random gaussian deviates scaled to the uncertainty ascribed to each point .",
    "this procedure simulates the effect of measurement uncertainties . applying the above procedure to the line and continuum light curves and",
    "cross - correlating them is considered one realization of the monte carlo simulations .",
    "using such @xmath28 realizations builds up a cross - correlation peak distribution ( ccpd ; maoz & netzer 1989 ) .",
    "the range of uncertainty contains 68% of the monte carlo realizations in the ccpd and thus would correspond to @xmath29 uncertainty for a normal distribution .",
    "peterson et al . ( 1998b ) demonstrate that under a wide variety of realistic conditions , the combined fr / rss procedure yields conservative uncertainties compared to the true situation .    from the 46 line light curves 40 result with a significant correlation ( peak correlation coefficients above 0.4 ) .",
    "all 40 ccfs indicate a positive time lag of the balmer lines with respect to the optical continuum .",
    "the time lags are of order of a few weeks to a few months , and the ccf peaks are highly significant for most lines . we conclude that a time lag has been detected in one or more of the balmer lines for _ all _ 17 quasars .",
    "to construct the largest sample with available reverberation mapping data we analyze our data together with comparable published data for other agns .",
    "wandel et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have uniformly analyze reverberation mapping data of 17 seyfert 1 s and deduce time lags using the same techniques described in the previous section . combining their results with ours we obtain reliable size - mass - luminosity relations for 34 agns spanning over 4 orders of magnitude in luminosity .    * blr size : * since we have both h@xmath19 and h@xmath20 time lags for many objects we average the two to get a better estimate for the balmer lines time lag .",
    "we do not include h@xmath21 in the mean since its light curves are very noisy due to the small s / n of the line , and the uncertainty of the h@xmath21 time lag is consistent with zero in several cases , hence , counting it in the mean will add noise into our results .",
    "the blr size is then computed as the mean of the h@xmath19 and h@xmath20 time lags divided by a factor of @xmath30 to account for the cosmological time dilution . for the seyfert 1 s we use the h@xmath20 time lags from wandel et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and correct them by the @xmath31 factor .    * agn luminosity : * a major limitation in the luminosity determination is the lack of knowledge about the ionizing continuum and the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the objects in question .",
    "much of the ionizing continuum is emitted in the unobservable far - uv and there are still unsolved fundamental issues concerning the shape of the continuum ( e.g. , zheng et al .",
    "1997 ; laor et al .",
    "1997 ) . even in one of the best studied agns , ngc5548 , the sed is poorly determined ( dumont , collin - souffrin , & nazarova 1998 ) .",
    "another complication is the contribution of the host galaxy to the luminosity of the nucleus . since resolving these complications is an issue for an in - depth study we took the simplified approach ( following wandel et al .",
    "1999 ) of using the monochromatic luminosity , @xmath32 , at 5100    ( rest wavelength ) as our luminosity measure ( assuming deceleration parameter @xmath12 , hubble constant of @xmath13  kms@xmath5 , and zero cosmological constant ) . the uncertainty in this value is taken to be only due to the variation of each object and is represented by the root mean square ( rms ) of the continuum light curve .",
    "* central mass : * estimation of the agn s central mass is carried out by assuming gravitationally dominated motions of the blr clouds : @xmath33 ( e.g. , gaskell 1988 ; wandel et al .",
    "1999 ; peterson & wandel 1999 ) . in this relation",
    "the radius , @xmath34 , is the blr size computed above and the velocity , @xmath35 , is estimated from the rest - frame fwhm of the emission line . because the broad emission lines of agns are composed of a narrow component superposed on a broader components , a unique fwhm determination is not straightforward .",
    "we took two approaches to measure the fwhm : the first approach is to measure the fwhm of the balmer lines in each spectrum for a given object and then to use the mean fwhm , @xmath36(mean ) .",
    "the second approach is the one proposed by peterson et al .",
    "( 1998a ) of using the rms spectrum to compute the fwhm of the lines , @xmath36(rms ) . in principle",
    ", constant features in the mean spectrum ( such as narrow forbidden emission lines , narrow components of the permitted emission lines , galactic absorptions , and constant continuum and broad - line features ) are excluded in this method .",
    "the fwhm from the rms spectrum measures only the part of the line that varies and thus corresponds to the blr size measured from the reverberation mapping . in the following we uses the two approaches together in order to compare them .",
    "following the approach of averaging the h@xmath19 and h@xmath20 time lags , we also average the fwhm of the h@xmath19 and h@xmath20 lines . to calculate the mass we also introduced a factor of @xmath37 , to account for velocities in three dimensions and for using half of the fwhm .",

    "figure  [ diff]demonstratesthatmonitoring high - luminosity high - redshiftquasars is feasible and interesting results can be obtained , however , it also demonstrates the difficulty to carry out such a monitoring using small to medium size telescopes .",
    "even though the total integration time is 4 hours and the observing conditions are good the s / n of the spectra is poor .",
    "it is clear that a large telescope is needed to carry out this spectroscopic program .",
    "early in 2000 we started monitoring a subsample of our 11 quasars with the 8 m hobby - eberly telescope which is partly owned by the pennsylvania state university .",
    "we hope that within a short time we will be able to present preliminary results from this long term monitoring program .",
    "we reviewed the final results from a spectrophotometric monitoring of a large , optically selected quasar sample ( for the detailed study see kaspi et al . 2000 ) .",
    "we find time lags between the optical continuum and the balmer - line light curves for _ all _ agns with adequate sampling .",
    "our work doubled the number of agns with a measured time lag ( i.e. , blr size ) .",
    "we also increased the available luminosity range for studying the size ",
    "luminosity relations in agns from two to four orders of magnitude allowing , for the first time , to construct reliable relations . using all agns with known blr size",
    "we find that the blr size scales with the 5100  luminosity as @xmath202 .",
    "this is significantly different from previous studies and is in contradiction with simple theoretical expectations , both suggesting @xmath183 .",
    "we also obtained a mass  luminosity relation for agns , @xmath203 , which , however , has a large intrinsic scatter .",
    "these findings impose new and strict limitations on theoretical considerations and constrain any theoretical models which attempt to explain the agn phenomenon .",
    "one of our major current goals is to further increase our knowledge about continuum and line variations and blr size in high - luminosity quasars ( @xmath198ergss@xmath5 ) . to that end",
    "we are initiating a program to monitor a sample of 11 high - luminosity high - redshift quasars .",
    "we presented preliminary results of the continuum variations in those objects to be @xmath200 mag .",
    "spectrophotometric observations of the sample is on the way and we hope that with 8 m class telescopes such as the hobby - eberly telescope we will be able in a few years to extend our knowledge about blr size to the most luminous quasars .",
    "the conclusion of this long - term monitoring will hopefully complete the reverberation studies to cover the entire agns luminosity range of @xmath3@xmath4ergss@xmath5 .",
    "i deeply thank my collaborators in the pg quasars monitoring program uriel giveon , buell jannuzi , dan maoz , hagai netzer , and paul smith who spent years of work to achieve the results presented here .",
    "i would also like to thank my additional collaborator in the high - luminosity quasars monitoring program niel brandt , donald schneider , and ohad shemmer .",
    "research at the wo is supported by grants from the israel science foundation .",
    "monitoring of pg quasars at so was supported by nasa grant nag 5 - 1630 .",
