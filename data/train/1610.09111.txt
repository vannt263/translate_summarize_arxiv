    "the migdal and liashberg theory of `` strong - coupling superconductivity''@xcite has been very successful in qualitative description of superconductivity in real materials@xcite . for example",
    ", it explains the deviation from the universal value @xmath0 in bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory , or the dependence of critical magnetic field on the transition temperature .",
    "moreover , in some situation , it is known that the strong - coupling effect is not only a quantitative but also a qualitative effect ( e.g. , refs .",
    "the strong - coupling effect modifies the spectrum of the quasiparticles .",
    "therefore , one can expect that it may change the structure of low - energy states within the vortices in type - ii superconductors .",
    "as far as we know , however , there have been only a few studies of the strong - coupling effect on a vortex on the basis of microscopic theories .    two - dimensional chiral _",

    "this state is topologically non - trivial and attracts much attention in these days . within the vortices of this superconductor , reflected in the topology of this system",
    ", there is a zero - energy bound state , which is expected to be very robust against not - so - strong impurities@xcite .",
    "recently , the relationship between this robustness and the odd - frequency pairing also has been discussed@xcite .    in the present paper , we calculated the self - consistent liashberg equation to study how the strong - coupling feature affects the vortex of a chiral _ p_-wave superconductor microscopically",
    ". we also calculated the free - energies of the vortices and discuss its stability .",

    "the quasiclassical green s function satisfies the normalization condition @xmath18 and its bulk value is @xmath19    to incorporate strong - coupling effect , we use liashberg equation to calculate the self - energy @xmath20 from the quasiclassical green s function ; @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the cutoff of the matsubara frequencies , @xmath23 is the density of states on the fermi level , and @xmath24 denotes the average over the fermi surface and is defined @xmath25 . we took 47 equally spaced points in the momentum space .",

    "we set the cutoff of the matsubara frequencies @xmath36 , and confirm that this cutoff is considered to be sufficiently large by comparison of the magnitude of the bulk pair - potential with those for @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "we also define @xmath39 and use it as a characteristic length of the spatial modulation of the self - energy .",
    "the vector potential @xmath16 is obtained from the quasiclassical green s function as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a trace over the nambu space .",
    "we define @xmath42 as a characteristic length of the electromagnetic entities .",
    "we set @xmath43 in this paper .    to discuss the stability of the isolated vortices , we calculated the free - energy deviation from the normal state @xmath44 with the following equation : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the magnetic field , and @xmath47 is a solution of @xmath48&= \\check 0    , & \\check g_s^2=-{\\pi}^2\\check\\tau_0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the above expression of @xmath44 is a simple extension of the weak - coupling bcs one@xcite .",
    "we used the 15-points gauss - kronrod quadrature formula to integrate respect to @xmath49 .",
    "we numerically confirmed that the self - energy for matsubara - frequencies @xmath50 can be decoupled as @xmath51    \\label{eq : self - energy - form }    , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and thus we show only the @xmath52-dependent part @xmath53 and @xmath54 in the following section . at sufficiently far from the vortex , only @xmath55 or @xmath56 survives .",

    "p_-wave superconductivity has internal angular momentum ( chirality ) .",
    "if there is a vortex , two types of vortices can exist in this system ; one type of vortex has vorticity ( the angular momentum of vortex ) parallel to the chirality , and the other type has vorticity anti - parallel to the chirality . in the present paper ,",
    "we call the former `` parallel vortex '' and the latter `` anti - parallel vortex '' . in the ginzburg - landau(gl )",
    "theory , an anti - parallel vortex was shown to be more stable than a parallel vortex@xcite .",
    "to solve , we used so - called riccati - parametrization method@xcite and solved the parametrized differential equation with a 4th- and 5th - order adaptive runge - kutta method .",
    "we used the cylindrical coordinate system and took 48 equally spaced points on the azimuthal coordinates . to improve the accuracy of numerical integration of the free - energy",
    ", we used the composite gauss - lobatto quadrature to choose discrete points @xmath57 on the radial line .",
    "we divided the closed interval @xmath58 $ ] into 16 subintervals , applied the 7-points gauss - lobatto formula to each subinterval and obtained 97 discrete points @xmath59 , and changed the variable as @xmath60 in order to make the sampling points denser near the center and more sparse far from the vortex .",
    "we calculated the self - energy from the quasiclassical green s functions via and iterated the above until the self - energy sufficiently converged . after obtaining converged solution , we calculated the free - energy of vortices using .",
    "we changed initial profiles of the vortices so that the initial dominant- and induced- vortices were at separate positions , and repeated the same procedure as the above .",

    "figure [ fig : profile - of - non - axisymmetric - parallel - vortex ] shows the non - axisymmetric profile of dominant and induced parts of off - diagonal self - energy at @xmath71 and @xmath72 . there",
    "the vortex of dominant component forms triangle and those of the induced component split into three .",
    "figure [ fig : current - in - non - axisymmetric - parallel - vortex ] shows the current density around the vortex .",
    "we can confirm that the electromagnetic quantities also break the axisymmetry .",
    "when we calculated parallel vortices at @xmath73 , we found only an axisymmetric vortex : both circular and non - circular initial configurations of self - energy produce the same result .",
    "we thus conclude that unusual parallel vortices may not exist at high temperatures . in figure",
    "[ fig : free - energy - for - parallel - vortex ] , we plot the free - energy of each vortex .",
    "we can see that at low temperatures , the non - axisymmetric vortex is more stable than symmetric one .",
    "we note that the symmetric anti - parallel vortex is more stable than the non - axisymmetric parallel vortex , at least under the parameters in this study .",
    "there are many studies of non - axisymmetric vortices in spin triplet superfluids or superconductors with an isotropic fermi surface .",
    "however , many of them have targeted vortices in the superfluid @xmath74he - b@xcite , or an _ f_-wave superconductor similar to the @xmath74he - b@xcite ; these studies therefore can not be compared with our work directly .",

    "_ have studied two - dimensional chiral _",
    "p_-wave superconductor within the gl theory in the weak- to strong - coupling regimes@xcite .",
    "they have reported that non - axisymmetric vortices can emerge in some non - weak - coupling coefficients . however , the coefficients of the gl - functional of our target system fall into the same ones that we obtain in the weak - coupling limit ( the @xmath75 parameter in ref .",
    "@xcite is 0.5 in our system ) .",
    "thus , the origin of non - axisymmetric vortices in our work is different from that of the previous work .",
    "this is also consistent with the fact that non - axisymmetric vortices only exist at low temperatures in the present work .",
    "aoyama and ikeda have reported that a vortex of @xmath74he - a can be non - axisymmetric under the existence of anisotropic scatterers@xcite .",
    "their model is different from ours , and the relationship between their and our results considered an important but remaining issue .",
    "in this study , we numerically found that a non - axisymmetric vortex metastably exists in strong - coupling chiral _ p_-wave superconductors .",
    "this anomalous vortex is more stable than the axisymmetric parallel one at sufficiently low temperatures , but symmetric anti - parallel vortex is still most stable .",
    "the emergence of this anomalous vortex is a consequence of the strong - coupling effect because we did not obtain such a vortex with the conventional weak - coupling gap equation . to clarify the underlying energetics that makes the non - axisymmetric vortex metastable is an interesting issue .",
    "the total phase diagram of this system is also left as a future issue .",
