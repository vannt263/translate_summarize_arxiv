    "the complexity in the study of the non - equilibrium dynamics in isolated many - body quantum systems is at first sight overwhelming . at the same time",
    ", many interesting questions naturally arise when a system is brought out of equilibrium , for example regarding the nature of quantum decoherence or relaxation processes . in the past decade , these issues have been at the center of a fruitful theoretical research activity , partially motivated by the experimental achievements in the physics of ultra - cold atoms , such as the possibility to realize highly isolated and controlled many - body quantum systems with reduced effective dimensionality @xcite . in particular , due to the exact solvability of several one - dimensional quantum systems , they represent an ideal framework where exact theoretical results can be compared with experimental data .",
    "many studies have already shown that integrable one - dimensional many - body hamiltonians can be experimentally engineered and their non - equilibrium dynamics probed in exquisite detail @xcite .",
    "arguably , the simplest protocol to bring a system out of equilibrium is that of a quantum quench @xcite : a well - defined initial state ( usually the ground state of some hamiltonian @xmath2 ) is prepared at time @xmath3 and subsequently time evolved with some hamiltonian @xmath4 . after the quench , it is expected that an extended system should act as an infinite thermal bath on its own finite subsystems and , accordingly , local properties should relax to stationary values described by a gibbs ensemble . for a generic ( i.e. non - integrable ) model",
    ", this picture turns out to be correct and the time - dependent local correlations indeed approach thermal stationary values @xcite .    a different behavior is observed in integrable systems . in this case , local correlations still approach stationary values but these are not in general given by a thermal ensemble .",
    "the reason lies in the existence of an infinite set of conservation laws which constrain the dynamics at all times .",
    "the thermal gibbs ensemble then has to be replaced by a generalized gibbs ensemble ( gge ) , which is built taking into account all the local and quasi - local conserved operators ( or charges ) of the system @xcite .",
    "the importance of a notion of locality for the charges was not realized immediately and it was first pointed out in refs .",
    "the gge has been first considered for integrable models admitting a free particles representation @xcite and only after for genuinely interacting integrable models ( see the volume @xcite as a collection of reviews on the subject ) .",
    "the efforts to better understand the range of validity of the gge for interacting integrable models has already produced important conceptual and technical advances in our understanding of non - equilibrium physics in isolated quantum systems .",
    "in particular , one promising development is the so called quench action method @xcite , which is an integrability based analytical approach to study the time evolution following a quench .",
    "one of its main results is that the effective long - times stationary state can be represented by an highly excited eigenstate of the post - quench hamiltonian .",
    "this description is complementary to the gge and it is analogous to the one employed in the standard treatment of the thermodynamic bethe ansatz .",
    "indeed , in the latter it is well known that the thermal gibbs ensemble can be effectively replaced by a maximal entropy representative eigenstate @xcite .",
    "while integrable models are by definition special , they can be engineered to a great level of accuracy in cold atomic systems ( as e.g. in refs .",
    "@xcite ) and furthermore understanding their quench dynamics leads to remarkable insights also for the dynamics of more generic systems @xcite .    the quench action method has proven to be extremely versatile , with applications to quantum quenches in various models ranging from spin chains @xcite , to bose gases @xcite and integrable quantum field theories @xcite , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review .",
    "it is , however , limited to those initial states for which the overlaps with the eigenstates of the post - quench hamiltonian are known exactly .",
    "these quantities are in general extremely difficult to compute and so far no general scheme has been developed to tackle this problem which has been solved only in a few cases @xcite .    in the quantum quench literature ,",
    "the xxz spin-@xmath0 heisenberg chain has served as the simplest interacting many - body quantum system where analytical predictions could be tested with high precision against numerical methods @xcite . even in this prototypical model ,",
    "the quench dynamics from simple families of product states can not in general be analyzed by means of the quench action approach because the overlaps with the eigenstates are still missing . physically interesting examples of such states can be found amongst those considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was investigated how symmetries that are initially broken can be restored at late times after a quench .",
    "the heisenberg spin chain has also been the prototypical example which allowed to understand that the known ( ultra-)local charges in integrable models are in general not complete and new independent families of quasi - local conserved operators exist .",
    "these were firstly introduced in the context of transport problems @xcite , where their consequences have been explored in great detail @xcite , see @xcite for a recent review .",
    "it was only later understood that quasi - local conservation laws have to be taken into account in the gge construction @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that independent works have also shown the existence and physical relevance of conservation laws with a generalized notion of locality in free xy spin chains @xcite and quantum field theories @xcite .",
    "it has been explicitly shown that the quasi - local charges in the xxz heisenberg chain form a complete set of conservation laws @xcite : fixing their expectation value uniquely determines a single excited state of the hamiltonian in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this result has a natural application in the study of quantum quenches . indeed , assuming the existence of a post - quench representative eigenstate , this can be completely fixed by imposing that the expectation values of the quasi - local conserved charges are equal to those computed in the initial state .",
    "for those cases for which the overlaps were known , it was shown @xcite that this approach leads to the same results obtained by applying the quench action method .",
    "in particular , in the xxz spin-@xmath0 chain a full analytical characterization of the post - quench stationary state was recovered for two particular initial states , namely the nel and the majumdar - ghosh state , as first derived in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in this work",

    "our study include the states considered in ref .",

    "@xcite , we show that even in these cases a closed - form analytical characterization of the post - quench stationary state can be explicitly exhibited . using these results , we compute the asymptotic value of the time - dependent local correlations after the quench and test our predictions against the tdmrg and itebd data of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "one of the main physical motivations for our work is to explore the features of post - quench steady states when initial states other than spin-@xmath0 nel and dimer states are considered .",
    "as we will see , qualitative different properties emerge for ferromagnets and antiferromagnets , such as different bound - state compositions . in turn",
    "these might be experimentally probed , for example by observing light - cones spreading of local perturbations on the post - quench steady state @xcite .",

    "the main technical obstacle in the investigation of quantum quenches in these models then remains the computation of correlation functions in the post - quench steady state .    on a more technical level",
    ", it would be interesting to understand for which states a closed - form analytical solution of the quench problem , similar to those presented in section [ sec : results ] , exists .",
    "as we have shown , this can not be expected in general .",
    "the answer might be related to the structure of the overlaps between the initial state and the eigenstates of the model and remains at present an open problem .",
    "finally , the efficiency of the method developed in @xcite and applied in this work should serve as a motivation to intensify the search for quasi - local conservation laws in models defined on the continuum .",
    "this could have important ramifications in the study of quantum quenches in systems such as the attractive lieb - liniger gas @xcite or the sine - gordon field theory @xcite , where bound states exist .",
    "indeed , it is at present not known whether quasi - local conserved charges analogous to those exploited here can be constructed in these models @xcite .",
    "we would like to thank enej ilievski for insightful discussions during the last stage of this work and comments based on his unpublished results .",
    "some of these were independently derived by us and have been presented in this work .",
    "we thank mario collura for providing the tdmrg and itebd data presented in ref .",
    "e.v . and p.c .",
    "acknowledge the financial support by the erc under starting grant 279391 edeqs .",
    "in this appendix we provide for completeness the integral formulas for local correlation functions which were used in our work , as reported in @xcite .",
    "these formulas only require as an input the functions @xmath58 characterizing the post - quench steady state .",
    "first , we introduce the set of auxiliary functions @xmath160 , @xmath161 as the solution of the following system of integral equations _",
    "n^(a)()&=&-s^(a)_n()-_m=1^(_nm)(),[rho_a_aux ] + ^(a)_n()&=&^(a)_n()+_m=1^(_nm)()-_m=1^(_nm)(),[sigma_aux ] where we employed the notation for the convolution of two functions and where s^(a)_n()&=&()^a s^(0)_n ( ) , + ^(a)_n()&=&()^a ^(0)_n ( ) , + s^(0)_n()&= & , + ^(0)_n()&=&- , and _",
    "jk()&=&- , + _ jk()&=&- .",
    "next , one defines the parameters _ ab&=&-2_n=1^s^(b)_n , + _",
    "ab&=&2(_n=1^_n^(b)+_n=1^s_n^(b ) ) , + _",
    "ab&=&-(-1)^(a+b)/2_ab-(-1)^b()^a+bk()|_=0 , + w_ab&=&-(-1)^(a+b-1)/2_ab+(-1)^b()^a+b()|_=0 , where we introduced the notation fg=_-/2^/2df()g ( ) , and where k()&= & , + ( ) & = & .",
    "finally , local correlators are given in terms of algebraic expressions involving the parameters @xmath162 and @xmath163 which are identical to those of the thermal case @xcite .",
    "for nearest and next - nearest neighbors , they read _ 1^z_2^z&=&()_00+w_10 , + _ 1^z_3^z&=&2(2)_00+w_10+()(_20 - 2_11)-^2()w_21 , + _",
    "1^x_2^x&=&--w_10 , + _ 1^x_3^x&=&--w_10-()(2)(_20 - 2_11)+^2()w_21 .",
    "the formulas for @xmath164 with @xmath165 are analogous but significantly longer and we do nt report them here .",
    "they are formally the same as in the thermal case , and can be found in @xcite .",
    "note that these formulas involve sums over an infinite number of strings , which have to be truncated when numerically evaluated . in general the number of strings required for high numerical precision might change drastically from the different initial states and with the parameters of the post - quench hamiltonian .",
    "for example , even at large values of @xmath72 , for the titled nel state we found that an increasing number of strings is required as the tilting angle @xmath53 grows ; in particular , the calculations corresponding to the results reported in fig .  [ fig:3 ] required to consider @xmath166 strings .",
    "in these cases where large numbers of strings have to be kept , auxiliary functions are most efficiently computed using the equivalent partially decoupled form of , which can be found in @xcite .",
