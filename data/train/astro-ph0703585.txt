    "cd-42@xmath011721 ( v921 sco , hen 3 - 1300 , iras 16555 - 4237 ) is a very interesting galactic southern object showing the b[e ] phenomenon .",
    "b[e ] stars are stars of spectral type b with an optical spectrum showing strong balmer line emission in combination with a large amount of permitted feii lines and forbidden oi and feii lines . in addition , these stars exhibit a strong near- and mid - ir excess due to circumstellar dust .",
    "this star was observed by merrill & burwell ( 1949 ) , who noted a peculiar nature in its spectrum . due to the presence of a nebulosity around it @xcite and possible spectral and photometric variations @xcite",
    ", it was tentatively classified as an haebe star ( de winter & th 1990 ; th , de winter & perez 1994 ) .",
    "based on a possible high temperature and luminosity , @xcite has suggested that cd-42@xmath011721 might be a young star but not a pre - main sequence object , while spectral similarities among cd-42@xmath011721 and cpd-52@xmath09243 ( a supergiant candidate , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and hd87643 ( an unclassified b[e ] star , @xcite ) increased the confusion about the evolutionary state of this star .",
    "an evolved nature was reinforced by @xcite , who claimed the existence of a nebular overabundance of n / o . other indications for a post - main sequence evolutionary phase came from the proposed high luminosity of this object by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this zoo of proposed evolutionary phases for cd-42@xmath011721 has lead to the inclusion of this star into the list of unclassified b[e ] stars by @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite suggested that cd-42@xmath011721 might be member of a cluster of several low and intermediate mass sources .                the confusion concerning the evolutionary stage of cd-42@xmath011721 is strictly linked to the absence of reliable physical parameters .",
    "since the optical spectrum does not display any photospheric lines , the spectral type derived using different sets of observations and methods , varies between b0 and aep , and consequently the t@xmath5 ranges from 31600k to 12300k @xcite .",
    "the range in distance is even worse : we found values from 136 pc up to 2.6 kpc @xcite .",
    "consequently its luminosity is not known either , being in the range @xmath6 ( mcgregor et al .",
    "1988 ; shore et al . 1990 ,",
    "hillenbrand et al . 1992 ) .",
    "these uncertain stellar parameters and therefore the rather poor knowledge of the evolutionary phase of cd-42@xmath011721 have stimulated us to investigate this object in more detail , based on a multiwavelength analysis .    in this paper",
    ", we are presenting new high- and low - resolution optical spectra together with a more detailed description of available infrared data taken from both the public catalogues as well as from the literature .",
    "we obtained a detailed optical spectral atlas , where the zoo of emission lines ( many of them previously undetected ) and the variety in line profiles give hints for the gas dynamics and distribution in the close - by circumstellar medium around cd-42@xmath011721 .",
    "we could also derive a set of stellar parameters based on our high - resolution data , allowing to compare the position of cd-42@xmath011721 in the hr diagram with evolutionary tracks .",
    "considering these stellar parameters , we have also modelled its sed considering different circumstellar scenarios : a spherically symmetric geometry , a passive flared disc and also an outflowing disc wind .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sect.[obs ] we describe our observations , the data reduction and the public data used .",
    "sect.[atlas ] gives a detailed optical spectral atlas and a description of the zoo of emission lines and the variety in line profiles found . in sect .",
    "4 we present a description of the ir region . on the basis of our optical spectra",
    "we derive in sect.[parameters ] the stellar parameters . in sect .",
    "6 we describe the sed modelling of this star , presenting the numerical codes developped by us , the results obtained and also the comparison between them and the literature ones . in sect . 7 , we discuss the possible nature of cd-42@xmath011721 and present the conclusions of our study .",
    "our optical spectra were obtained at the eso 1.52-m telescope in la silla ( chile ) using the high resolution fiber - fed extended range optical spectrograph ( feros ) and the low resolution boller & chivens spectrograph .",
    "feros is a bench - mounted echelle spectrograph with fibers , that cover a sky area of 2@xmath7 of diameter , with a wavelength coverage from 3600  to 9200  and a mean spectral resolution of r = 48000 corresponding to 2.2 pixels of 15@xmath8 m .",
    "it has a complete automatic on - line reduction , which we adopted .",
    "our feros spectrum presents the highest resolution used for observations of cd-42@xmath011721 to date .",
    "it was taken on june 10 , 2000 , with an exposure time of 5400 seconds .",
    "the s / n ratio in the 5500  region is approximately 60 .",
    "this high resolution spectrum and long wavelength coverage , shown in fig.[fig.1 ] will be used to obtain a detailed optical spectral atlas , for a detailed description of the different line profiles , to derive equivalent widths , and also to deblend some features in the low resolution spectra .",
    "the low resolution boller & chivens spectrum ( hereafter cassegrain spectrum ) was taken on the same observation run at eso , but on june 9 , 2000 , with an exposure time of 900 seconds .",
    "the instrumental setup employed made use of grating # 23 with 600 l mm@xmath9 , providing a resolution of @xmath10   in the range 3800 - 8700 . in the 5500  continuum region ,",
    "the s / n ratio of the cassegrain spectrum is aproximately 180 . since there is no completely line free region in the spectrum , the s / n derived is an upper limit .",
    "the slit width used has 2@xmath7 .",
    "considering that the nebula in which cd-42@xmath011721 is embedded has dimensions of @xmath11 40@xmath7 @xmath12",
    "80@xmath7 @xcite , our observations were centered on the innermost parts of it .",
    "the cassegrain spectrum was reduced using standard iraf tasks , such as bias subtraction , flat - field normalization , and wavelength calibration .",
    "we have done absolute flux calibration using spectrophotometric standards from @xcite .",
    "this spectrum is used to derive intensities of the emission lines for which we perform a detailed quantitative analysis .",
    "equivalent widths and line intensities in the linearized spectra have been measured using the iraf task that computes the line area above the adopted continuum .",
    "uncertainties in our measurements come mainly from the position of the underlying continuum and we estimate the errors to be about 20% for the weakest lines ( equivalent widths lower than 2 ) and",
    "about 10% for the strongest lines .",
    "we have also obtained photometric data from the literature , intending to describe the complete sed of cd-42@xmath011721 .",
    "in addition , we have described the ir spectra obtained by iso and iras satellites .",
    "these spectra are public and can be downloaded in the following web addresses : sws01-iso - http://isc.astro.cornell.edu/@xmath11sloan/library/swsatlas/aot1.html ; lrs - iras - http://www.iras.ucalgary.ca/@xmath11volk/getlrs@xmath13plot.html .",
    "the iras lrs spectrum covers a small wavelength range , from 7.5 to 22@xmath8 m , with a spectral resolution of about 20 - 60 . on the other hand , the iso sws01 spectrum has a higher resolution of @xmath11 1500 and a wavelength coverage from 2 to 50@xmath8 m .",
    "to identify the lines and to create a spectral atlas of the optical region of cd-42@xmath011721 , we have used the line lists provided by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we have also looked up two sites on the web : nist atomic spectra database lines form",
    "( _ http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/atdata/lines@xmath13form _ ) and the atomic line list v2.04 ( _ http://www.pa.uky.edu/@xmath11peter/atomic/_ ) .    fig.[fig.1 ] shows the complete high resolution spectrum of cd-42@xmath011721 .",
    "it is completely dominated by emission lines .",
    "the only absorption lines visible are the caii and nai lines , which are of interstellar origin , as well as the diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) .",
    "our spectra do not exhibit any photospheric lines .",
    "a huge number of permitted and forbidden emission lines were identified in the feros spectrum of cd-42@xmath011721 and listed in table[table1 ] given in the appendix .",
    "the individual columns in table[table1 ] contain the observed wavelength ( col .",
    "1 ) , equivalent width ( w(@xmath14 ) , in  , col .",
    "2 ) , the line profile type ( col .",
    "3 ) , and the proposed identification ( col .",
    "4 ) for each line . the line identification given in col . 4 encloses the ionization state of the element with the proposed transition and multiplet as well as the rest wavelength of the transition .",
    "it is possible that more than one ion can be allocated to a single feature . in these cases ,",
    "we give some possible alternative identifications .",
    "for some lines no identification could be found .",
    "these lines remain unidentified , labelled as ",
    "uid  in the tables",
    ".    inspection of table[table1 ] reveals a huge zoo of emission lines from atoms mostly singly ionized , as well as a variety in their line profiles .",
    "interestingly , there are also many emission lines from neutral metals like ci , ni , and oi , and some sporadic traces for the emission of si , and mgi as well .",
    "many of the lines listed in table[table1 ] are detected by the first time .    in the following ,",
    "we briefly discuss the presence of individual elements and lines and , if possible , compare our observations with previously published data .",
    "we especially highlight deviations of our observations from data in the literature which all seem to point in favour of either central source variability or ongoing changes in the csm conditions .",
    "in addition , we classify the different line profiles .",
    "* hydrogen : * the strongest lines in the spectra of cd-42@xmath011721 are the balmer lines ( fig.[balmer ] ) .",
    "we could identify the balmer series up to h9 at the blue edge of our spectrum . while h@xmath15 , h@xmath16 and h@xmath17 show indications for a double - peaked profile and broad wings extending to velocities of about 1400 , 600 , and 200kms@xmath9 respectively ( for the h@xmath15 wings see fig.[halpha_wings ] ) , the higher balmer lines are singly peaked and their wing velocities decrease systematically .",
    "the equivalent width of h@xmath15 is almost a factor 2.5 lower than the value reported by lopes , damineli neto & de freitas pacheco ( 1992 ) .",
    "the h@xmath16 equivalent width has also been reported to be variable @xcite . while it was found to be 27.7  in the 1985 observations",
    ", it increased to 41.5  in the 1988 observations .",
    "our value , observed in 2000 , lies with 30.4  in between .",
    "11721 high resolution ( feros ) spectrum .",
    "the lines are broad and in emission with h@xmath15 , h@xmath16 and h@xmath17 showing indications for a double - peaked profile .",
    "the absorption dip within the blue wing of h@xmath18 is the interstellar caii 3968  line . due to the scale of these figures ,",
    "the extended wings of especially the h@xmath15 and h@xmath16 lines can not be seen.,width=321 ]    in addition , at the long - wavelength end of the spectrum , the paschen series arises .",
    "from this series we could clearly identify the lines from pa(10 ) up to pa(40 ) .",
    "their profiles are all narrow and single - peaked ( see fig.[fig.1 ] ) .",
    "* helium : * helium seems to be variable in the spectrum of cd-42@xmath011721 . while it had ( possibly )",
    "been detected in the years 19451948 by @xcite , it was absent in the spectra of @xcite taken in 19491951 and 1962 , and reappeared again in the spectra observed in 1985 by @xcite and 1989 by @xcite . and also our data which have been taken in 2000 show emission of hei .",
    "we do not detect any line from heii .",
    "our data , which have been taken two years earlier than those of @xcite , confirm the presence of this emission line , and we can report on numerous additional identifications of emission lines of neutral oxygen , both forbidden and permitted .",
    "interestingly , the [ oi ] 6300  and 6364  lines show an asymmetric profile resembling a double - peaked line with a missing red peak , while the 5577  line is clearly single - peaked and very narrow compared to the other two lines ( fig.[ox1_lines ] ) .",
    "the profile of the [ oi ] line @xmath14 6300 shown by @xcite agrees with ours , but there are significant differences in the equivalent width of this line : while @xcite derived a value of 1.77 ,  the equivalent width found from our observations is only 1.20 .",
    "since the set - up for both observations was quite similar , this difference in equivalent width might hint towards rapidly changing conditions , e.g. in density and temperature structure , within the line forming region .",
    "* nitrogen : * the only previously detected emission line from nitrogen in the spectrum of cd-42@xmath011721 is the line [ nii ] @xmath145755 , cited by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the latter , however , ascribed the emission to the nebula and could not identify this line in the stellar spectrum . our high - resolution spectrum confirms the existence of this emission line .",
    "in addition , we detected the lines [ nii ] @xmath20 6548 , 6584 , as well as nii @xmath14 6173 .",
    "remarkably , we also identified many permitted emission lines from ni .",
    "* carbon : * the detection of any carbon line has not been reported yet . our spectrum clearly shows the presence of several lines of ci ( see e.g. fig.[halpha_wings ] ) , one line of cii and ciii each , as well as the possible detection of a [ ci ] line .",
    "* sulfur : * the existence of the [ sii ] @xmath20 6716 , 6731 lines has formerly been reported by @xcite as coming from the nebula .",
    "in addition to these lines , our spectrum also contains the line [ sii ] @xmath14 4068 while the @xmath14 4076 line is missing . from siii",
    "we could identify only one line , i.e. [ siii ] @xmath14 9069 .",
    "the line [ siii ] @xmath14 6311 does not show up in our spectrum .",
    "however , as in the case of n , o , and c , we have some indications for the presence of si emission .",
    "* iron : * it is the element with by far the largest number of emisison lines . with the exception of four lines allocated to feiii ( two forbidden and two permitted ) , all lines are from singly ionized iron .",
    "cd-42@xmath011721 is known to show a huge number of feii lines ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , however , the existence of an equally large amount of [ feii ] lines as we found in our spectrum , has previously not been reported .",
    "actually @xcite reported on a possible detection of a [ feii ] line , however this identification is rather doubtful due to their low spectral resolution .",
    "these lines show either single - peaked , double - peaked , or even multiple - peaked profiles , indicating a high complexity of the csm .",
    "the permitted lines are usually more intense than the forbidden ones and also broader with wings extending to 100200kms@xmath9 , while the line wings of the forbidden lines indicate velocities of about @xmath21kms@xmath9 , only .",
