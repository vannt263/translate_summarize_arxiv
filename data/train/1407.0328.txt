    "experimental studies ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) proved that layered superconductors can be treated as periodic structures where thin superconducting layers ( with thicknesses @xmath0 of about 0.2  nm ) are coupled through thicker dielectric layers ( with thicknesses @xmath1 of about 1.5  nm and a dielectric constant @xmath2 ) via the _ intrinsic josephson effect_. strongly anisotropic high - temperature superconductor crystals @xmath3 or artificial compounds @xmath4  -  @xmath5 are examples of such materials .",
    "they are of great interest from both technological and fundamental - science view points . for fundamental science ,",
    "the interest in layered superconductors is related to the specific type of plasma formed there due to its layered structure , the so - called josephson plasma . because of the essential difference in the nature of the currents along and across layers",
    ", this plasma is strongly anisotropic . indeed , the strong currents along the layers are of the same nature as in bulk superconductors , while the relatively small currents across the layers are related to the josephson effect .",
    "the strong current anisotropy provides the possibility for propagation of specific josephson plasma electromagnetic waves ( jpws ) in layered superconductors ( see , e.g. , refs .   and references therein ) .",
    "jpws belong to the terahertz frequency range , which is important for various applications , but not easily reachable with modern devices .",
    "the electrodynamics of layered superconductors is described by a set of coupled sine - gordon equations  @xcite for the gauge - invariant interlayer phase difference @xmath6 of the order parameter .",
    "these equations are nonlinear due to the nonlinear relation @xmath7 between the josephson interlayer current @xmath8 and @xmath6 . here",
    "we will consider the case of weak nonlinearity , @xmath9 , when @xmath10 can be expanded as @xmath11 . as was shown in refs .",
    ", even in this case the non - trivial nonlinear phenomena accompanying the propagation of jpws can be observed , e.g. , slowing down of light  @xcite , self - focusing of terahertz pulses  @xcite , excitation of nonlinear waveguide modes  @xcite , and self - induced transparency of the layered superconductors  @xcite .",
    "the noticeable change in the transparency of the cuprate superconductor , when increasing the wave amplitude , was recently observed in the important experiment , ref .  , where the excitation of josephson plasma solitons led to an effective decrease of the josephson resonance frequency .",
    "in this paper , we study theoretically the nonlinear interaction of the electromagnetic waves with different polarizations in a slab of layered superconductor placed into a waveguide with ideal metal walls .",
    "the waveguide axis is assumed to be parallel to the superconducting layers ( see fig .",
    "[ wavegab ] ) . due to the strong current anisotropy of the layered superconductor - vacuum interface ( the @xmath12-plane )",
    ", the transformation of the polarizations can be observed for the reflected and transmitted waves .",
    "we calculate the dependence of the transformation coefficients on the amplitude of the incident wave for the cases when the transverse magnetic ( tm ) mode transforms to the transverse electric ( te ) mode and vice versa .",
    "the main result of our paper consists in revealing a specific superposition principle which is valid even in the _ nonlinear _ case .",
    "we introduce two special mutually - orthogonal wave polarizations matched with the @xmath13-axis , which is perpendicular both to the waveguide axis ( @xmath14-axis ) and the crystallographic * c*-axis of the layered superconductor ( @xmath15-axis ) .",
    "the magnetic field in the wave of the first polarization ( we call it as h@xmath16 polarization ) and the electric field in the wave of the second polarization ( we call it as e@xmath16 polarization ) are perpendicular to the @xmath13-axis .",
    "we show that , in the main order with respect to the anisotropy parameter , the waves of these polarizations interact with the layered superconductor _ independently_. the incident wave of the h@xmath16 polarization has the electric field component parallel both to the vacuum - superconductor interface and to the crystallographic * ab*-plane .",
    "this wave excites strong shielding currents along the layers and , therefore , it penetrates into the sample over short length in the form of an evanescent wave and reflects almost completely from the superconductor . at the same time",
    ", the wave of the e@xmath16 polarization does not contain the electric field component parallel both to the sample surface and to the crystallographic * ab*-plane .",
    "therefore , the shielding currents flow along the * c*-axis only and they are relatively small in this case .",
    "so , the wave of the e@xmath16 polarization can propagate in a layered superconductor and penetrates over long distances .",
    "this wave partially reflects and partially transmits through the sample .",
    "we show that , in spite of the nonlinearity , the h@xmath16 and e@xmath16 waves do not practically interact . therefore , to study the reflection and transmission of the te and tm incident waves ( or the waves of any other polarization ) , we can perform the following steps :    1 .",
    "express the incident wave as the _ superposition _ of two modes of h@xmath16 and e@xmath16 polarizations .",
    "2 .   study the reflection and transmission of these modes _",
    "separately_. 3 .",
    "represent the reflected and transmitted fields of the h@xmath16 and e@xmath16 modes as superpositions of the te and tm modes .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we derive the electromagnetic fields in the vacuum and in the layered superconductor and justify the superposition principle for the waves with h@xmath16 and e@xmath16 polarizations . in the third section , we study the nonlinear reflection and transmission of the e@xmath16 waves through the slabs of layered superconductors . in the fourth section ,",
    "we apply the revealed superposition principle for the cases of the te and tm waves incidence . in the final section ,",
