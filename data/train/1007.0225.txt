    "immunotherapy seeks to arm the patient with an increased number of effective immune cells that are specifically trained to seek out and destroy harmful cells .",
    "one target for immunotherapy that has earned a place in the clinical spotlight recently is melanoma , since specific peptides have been isolated from melanoma cells that can be used in cancer vaccines .",
    "a subset of immune cells , called dendritic cells , are able to stimulate the production of immune effector cells that are capable of recognizing and killing specific tumor cells .",
    "researchers have been able to extract these cells from patients and culture them _ ex vivo _ to create a vaccine that can boost a patient s response against their own cancerous cells , @xcite .",
    "the success of clinical trials of dendritic cell ( dc ) vaccines has resulted in the recent fda approval of the first cancer vaccine for prostate cancer , @xcite    despite promising clinical responses in vaccine trials , it remains difficult to predict which patients will actually respond to these vaccines and why , .",
    "this may be due to the complicated kinetics of the immune response to the presentation of antigen by the dendritic cells . in this paper",
    ", we analyze the effect of the delay between the time the dcs come into contact with the t - cell population and the initiation of the expansion , or proliferating phase .",
    "we focus on the dynamics describing the active effector t - cell population in the spleen , using a phenomenological description that captures the effect of the delay .",
    "our goal here is to isolate the role of this delay term in order to analyze its effect on the sustainability of t - cell production .",
    "the model we present is very simple , and is not intended to realistically capture the entire cascade of immune events in the response to antigen presentation by dendritic cells . nor does this model describe the trafficking of immune cells between compartments of the body , in particular between lymphoid organs , such as the spleen , and the tumor site .",
    "these effects are crucial to the understanding of the immune response and must be considered in the design of vaccine therapies .",
    "one group of experiments that looks at the trafficking of dcs between compartments is described in @xcite , and a mathematical model of dc trafficking and t - cell activation is presented in @xcite .",
    "elsewhere we combine these ideas , along with previous work on cell - lysis rates , @xcite , in a more realistic model that includes several types of immune cells , and trafficking between compartments .    in section [ modeldescription ]",
    "we describe the model itself , and then we show stability switching as a function of the delay in section [ stability ] .",
    "we conclude with some discussion of the model simulations and results in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "after encountering antigen , such as tumor cells or tumor peptides , dendritic cells migrate to lymph organs such as the spleen . as they migrate , they mature and , upon arrival in the spleen , they are able to activate the proliferation of t - cells that have the ability to seek out and destroy ( _ lyse _ ) the specific target cells that provided the antigen .",
    "this activation requires some contact time between the dendritic cells and the naive t - cells ; this connection time is called the ",
    "synaptic connection time . \" in our model , we represent this time as a delay , @xmath0 .",
    "once proliferation is initiated , new antigen - specific t - cells are created .",
    "a somewhat simplified description of the fate of these new cells is as follows : the cells must go through a check - point during which the new cells are tested for efficacy against the antigen .",
    "if they pass this test , they either move into the blood stream to migrate to the target cells , they become memory cells in order to protect against future challenges by the same antigen , or they return to the proliferating compartment to produce more specific t - cells .",
    "proliferation continues only while certain cytokines are present .",
    "these cytokines are produced by previously activated t - cells that have been in contact with dendritic cells for the synaptic connection time , @xmath0 .",
    "when the dendritic cells have done their job  educating \" the t - cells , it is believed that they die , @xcite , and are then  cleared \" from the spleen compartment .",
    "when the dcs are no longer present , cell proliferation ceases , and the activated t - cells either move into the blood stream or become memory cells . this process is represented graphically in figure [ fig : modelprocess ] .    in this model ,",
    "the concentration of the dendritic cells at a given time , @xmath1 , is given by @xmath2 , while the number of activated t - cells is given by @xmath3 .",
    "the activation / proliferation rate is then given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is represents the  feedback \" function .",
    "feedback \" function depends on the number of t - cells present in the proliferating compartment time @xmath0 earlier in the presence of the dcs ; therefore they are producing the necessary cytokines .",
    "the current number of proliferating t - cells is represented by @xmath3 .",
    "we assume that the  feedback \" function , @xmath5 , is a positive function that increases to some maximum level , @xmath6 , and then decreases .",
    "the justification for this functional form is that activation by dcs is maximized at a certain concentration of dcs in the spleen .",
    "the addition of more dcs has the effect of keeping the activated cells in the area .",
    "if they are present for too long , the effectiveness of the t - cells begins to diminish .",
    "this is sometimes called the  decreasing potential hypothesis \" in the literature , @xcite . one simple function that captures these dynamics",
    "is given by :    .3 in -.5 in .2 in    where @xmath7 represents the population of active t - cells from time @xmath0 ago .",
    "we assume that t - cells leave the proliferating compartment through death , moving into the blood stream or the memory compartment at an average per - cell rate , @xmath8 .",
    "putting these pieces together results in the following single delay equation : @xmath9 where for simplicity : @xmath10    by rescaling the time variable , we can assume that @xmath11 , ( the decay parameter , @xmath12 , must also be appropriately scaled ) .",
    "simulated solutions are shown in figures [ fig : sampletrajectories_tauzero ] and [ fig : switchingtimes ] .",
    "these solutions show that changing the value of @xmath0 , as well as the initial history ( the values of @xmath3 for @xmath13 ) , can have a strong effect on the long - term behavior of the system .",
    "we verify this in the next section by performing a stability analysis .",
    "when dendritic cells are present in the spleen , @xmath14 , so that the differential equation becomes : @xmath15      equation [ eqn : scaleddde ] potentially has three equilibria .",
    "one is the zero fixed point : @xmath17 , and the other two are solutions to @xmath18 these two solutions are depicted graphically in figure [ fig : twoequil ] .",
    "note that the function @xmath19 has a maximum which occurs at @xmath20 .",
    "when the maximum of this function is greater than @xmath12 the two additional equilibria will exist .",
    "this occurs for @xmath21 .",
    "we denote the greater of these two equilibria by @xmath22 , and the smaller by @xmath23 , if they exist .    if @xmath22 is stable , then proliferation is sustained , and active effector cells continue to be produced and sent into the blood stream and into the memory compartment .",
    "however , if @xmath22 is unstable , then production may die off and no new effector cells will be produced , even when dcs are still present in the spleen .",
    "our goal in this section is to show that changing the value of the delay , @xmath0 , can change the stability of @xmath22 .",
    "linearization around an equilibrium , @xmath24 gives : @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , evaluated at the equilibrium @xmath24 , and @xmath28 .",
    "the characteristic equation is : @xmath29 evaluating @xmath30 and @xmath31 at @xmath32 gives : @xmath33 @xmath34 when we consider the characteristic equation in the case of the equilibrium @xmath17 , we always obtain @xmath35 , _ independent of @xmath0 . _",
    "thus we see that the equilibrium at @xmath36 is * always stable*.    on the other hand , linearizing around the upper equilibrium at @xmath22 in the case when @xmath16 gives : @xmath37 using the fact that @xmath38 , we see that stability of the upper equilibrium is ensured if @xmath39    we saw earlier that the maximum of @xmath40 occurs at @xmath41 , and we know that @xmath42 . because we assume @xmath43",
    ", we see that equation [ eqn : xstarcondition ] is satisfied .",
    "therefore , when @xmath16 , @xmath22 is * stable*.    since @xmath16 corresponds to the ode case , and @xmath23 lies between the two stable equilibria @xmath17 and @xmath44 , we know that @xmath23 is * unstable*. sample trajectories are shown in figure [ fig : sampletrajectories_tauzero ] .",
    "changes in stability can occur when the real part of @xmath45 switches sign , i.e. when @xmath45 is purely imaginary . in this case",
    ", the characteristic equation becomes @xmath46 at the upper equilibrium , @xmath22 , @xmath47 .",
    "equating the real and imaginary parts in equation [ eqn : om ] in this case gives : @xmath48 the first equation implies that @xmath49 .",
    "substituting this into the second equation gives : @xmath50 for a fixed value of @xmath12 , this gives a sequence of possible switching times , at which the equilibrium at @xmath22 can change stability .",
    "for example , taking @xmath51 , we see that @xmath52 , and possible switching times occur when @xmath53 figure [ fig : switchingtimes ] shows numerical solutions for increasing values of @xmath0 .",
    "we see that the equilibrium point at @xmath52 loses stability when @xmath54 , when a limit cycle appears .",
    "increasing @xmath0 destroys this limit cycle and , for larger values of @xmath0 , solutions that once tended to @xmath22 converge to the zero equilibrium .",
    "we have presented a simplified model of the interaction between dendritic cells and t - cells at the initiation of a specific immune response .",
    "the model contains one delay that represents the synaptic connection time between dendritic cells and t - cells which is necessary for the development of cytokines that stimulate proliferation .",
    "there is experimental evidence that prolonged contact between dendritic cells and t - cells results in a decrease in viable t - cell production .",
    "the model presented here shows a change in stability of the high t - cell equilibrium as the delay is increased .",
    "this equilibrium goes from being stable when the delay , @xmath0 , is small to being unstable for larger values of @xmath0 .",
    "these results support the experimental evidence for the  decreasing potential hypothesis \" .",
    "the model also suggest a role for dendritic cell therapies in boosting the immune defense against certain diseases such as cancer .",
    "however , the model indicates that levels of dendritic cells in the spleen should not be maintained at high levels for too long in order to optimize the expansion of active effector t - cells .",
