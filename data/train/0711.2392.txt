    "the solar radius is a key parameter for understanding the sun s evolution and many astrophysical applications .",
    "being our closest star , the sun can be considered as our laboratory , allowing us to determine its radius with high precision . over the past 25 years",
    "various groups were dedicated to determine the solar radius by applying basically two approaches .",
    "first , there is the direct measurement of the photospheric radius . in earlier times",
    "its visual determination was carried out by an observer .",
    "later , employing ccd - imaging devices , the visual radius determination was replaced by deriving the inflection point to the intensity profile of the limb . the error of both methods has been investigated in detail by @xcite who derive a solar radius of 959.60 , which agrees well with 959.63 @xmath5 0.10 or 695.99 @xmath50.07 mm @xcite , commonly used for calibrating solar evolutionary models @xcite .",
    "second , @xcite determine the helioseismic radius by means of f - mode frequencies obtained from the michelson doppler imager ( * ? ? ?",
    "* mdi ) on board the esa / nasa spacecraft soho . due to the high quality of the mdi observations",
    "the helioseismic determination is very precise and leads to a radius that is approximately 0.3  mm smaller than the standard value by @xcite .",
    "@xcite conclude that the standard solar radius has to be decreased by this value .",
    "finally , @xcite determine the solar radius from observations obtained with the high altitude observatory s solar diameter monitor ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hao sdm ) by applying a model of the data reduction procedure .",
    "the authors point out that there are significant uncertainties associated with the currently used radius value which are related to the definition of the solar limb adopted in the radius determinations and the reduction of the measured value to the photosphere .",
    "the authors indicate a height of about 0.3 mm which perhaps explains the radius correction inferred from the f - mode frequencies . in the present paper",
    "we determine the difference between the height at @xmath1 at disk center and the distance of the inflection point from radiative transfer calculations for two wavelengths and atmosphere structures .",
    "with the radiative transfer code we calculate the solar limb function for the mdi continuum intensity and the continuum at 5000 .",
    "is a combination of a model atmosphere code in spherical symmetry , developed by @xcite and the spectrum synthesis program , going back to @xcite and further developed by @xcite .",
    "the adaption to the solar atmosphere has been published in @xcite .",
    "the model atmosphere code calculates the nlte population numbers for a set of specified atomic levels by solving the radiative transport equations simultaneously with the equations for statistical equilibrium .",
    "the radiative transfer is solved along rays parallel to the central ray incident on a spherical distribution of the physical atmosphere structure @xcite .",
    "a spherical geometry allows to calculate geometrically correct the emerging intensity at the limb and line of sights beyond the solar limb .",
    "we base the model calculations on two model atmosphere structures for the quiet sun , the lte structure by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter kurucz91 ) and the nlte structure model c by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter fontenla07 ) .",
    "the radius at disk center where @xmath1 , is set to the solar radius derived from seismic observations , @xmath6=695.68  mm as given by @xcite .",
    "the high resolution ni line profile has been convolved with the five mdi filter functions f0 to f4 used to determine the actual continuum intensity observed by mdi .",
    "fig.[fig : limb ] panel ( a ) shows the mean intensity variation for the mdi continuum at the solar limb applying all five mdi filter functions and the continuum at 5000 calculated with the lte and nlte model atmosphere structures . distance zero refers to the seismic solar radius @xmath6=695.68  mm , i.e. @xmath1 at disk center .",
    "+    for the exact determination of the inflection point we calculate the derivative @xmath7 ( @xmath8 being the outward coordinate ) of all four limb profiles , shown in fig.[fig : limb ] panel ( b ) .",
    "the two atmosphere structures agree well in the photosphere and lead to very similar intensity profiles .",
    "the derivative of the intensity is always negative and shows a local minimum at the inflection point .",
    "the distances of the local minima for all four limb profiles are given in table[tab : inflex ] .",
    "the mean value of the distance for the two atmosphere structures for @xmath9  is 0.347@xmath50.06  mm , where we used the difference between the two atmosphere structures as criterion to derive the error introduced by the atmosphere structures .",
    "this result is close to the value of 0.370 mm estimated by @xcite based on the atmosphere structure by @xcite .    in evolutionary models",
    "the radius is typically defined as the point where the temperature equals the effective temperature , i.e. where @xmath2 . from our calculations",
    "we find that the height where @xmath2 is in the mean 0.014  mm further out than where @xmath1 .",
    "thus the correction of an inflection point measurement to the seismic radius is 0.333  mm .",
    "this correction explains the discrepancy between the modeled and observed f - mode frequencies .",
    "we conclude that the standard radius used in the evolutionary models has to be corrected by value this value , leading to 695.66  mm .",
    "cr@.lr@.lr@.lr@.l & + atmosph .",
    "& +    kurucz91 & 0&367 & 0&344 + fontenla07 & 0&370 & 0&350 + @xmath10 & 0&003 & 0&006 + @xmath11 & 0&368 & 0&347 +",
    "for consistency we investigate whether recent inflection point measurements are compatible with the mean of seismic radii relating to @xmath2 , i.e. where the temperature equals the effective temperature , by applying this correction term .",
    "table [ tab : radii ] gives the solar radii based on ii ) ip measurements , ii ) seismic radii .",
    "the mean values deviate by @xmath00.24  mm . in table[tab : radii2 ] we correct the mean radius values of the inflection point observation by 0.333  mm and compare the result with the mean seismic radius , leading to a difference of 0.09@xmath50.17  mm .",
    "we conclude that the inflection point measurements and the seismic radius can be reconciled by applying the correction of 0.333  mm .",
    "our calculations indicate that the position of mdi continuum inflection point is by 0.02  mm further out than for 5000 . the radius value determined by @xcite ( see table[tab : radii ] ) refers to the inflection point of the intensity profile observed by mdi .",
    "the difference of 0.02  mm can not explain the somewhat lower radius value by @xcite .",
    "we emphasis that we do not consider any variation of the solar diameter with time @xcite , which however could explain some of the deviation of the radius values .",
    "furthermore , our considerations are with respect to the quiet sun .",
    "from radiative transfer calculations with the spherical code cosi we determine a distance of 0.333@xmath50.008  mm ( @xmath3 mm ) between the height where @xmath2 ( @xmath1 ) at disk center and the position of the inflection point of the 5000 intensity profile at the limb .",
    "this correction explains the differences between the f - mode frequencies derived from models calculations and observations .",
    "therefore , we conclude that standard solar radius currently used in evolutionary models has to be corrected by 0.333  mm and is 695.66  mm .    furthermore , the correction of 0.333  mm reconciles the radius values derived from inflection point measurements and the seismic radius by 0.09@xmath50.17  mm . due to the increasing precision of the instruments",
    "it becomes necessary that the community agrees on a generally binding definition of the solar radius and that values derived via different techniques are to be corrected accordingly .",
    "we propose that the solar radius refers to @xmath12 .",
    "thus , we suggest that the value of the solar radius determined from inflexion point measurements has to be lowered by 0.333  mm to be comparable with seismic radii",
    ". a detailed study of the position of the wavelength and solar cycle dependent inflection point will be crucial for upcoming observations with the sodism instrument on board picard @xcite .",
