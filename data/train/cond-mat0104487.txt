    "physicists are happy . their resources  amount of problems to solve ",
    "is infinite .",
    "it is not so , however , in almost all other professions ; the numbers of car buyers , voters , butterflies to catch and girls to kiss for the first time are limited . if one takes everything , others have to look for another hobby or job . on the other hand , cooperation is a fingerprint of modern society .",
    "all what we get except from our domestic gardens , we get from other people .",
    "the aim of this work is to present numerical results of a set of equations , where the above facts are built in as assumptions .",
    "the only way to increase one s power or richness or speed of getting resources , which are treated here as synonymous , is to profit work of somebody else .",
    "then , each agent @xmath2 has @xmath3 neighbours @xmath4 who feed its with given speeds @xmath5 .",
    "the limitation of resources is taken into account as the global coupling via a nonlinear verhulst - like term .",
    "these are first two r.h.s .",
    "terms of our basic equations , and these terms do not depend on @xmath2 .",
    "third term is to include some action of an @xmath2-th agent .",
    "namely , it selects from his neighbours the one most sensitive for this action , and enhances feeding from this particular neighbour .",
    "the problem belongs to the large class of models designed to describe a competition for resources @xcite .",
    "most frequently , however , some kind of dynamic equilibrium is considered , and only a few authors are interested in an ultimate catastrophe .",
    "example giving , although statistical physics provides tools for analysing stock market @xcite , the term `` bankruptcy '' is absent in physical journals ( see @xcite and @xcite for exceptions ) .",
    "it seems worthwhile to take a glance on a collision of expanding society with the boundary of limited resources .",
    "time evolution of the individual agent power @xmath6 is described by differential equation : @xmath7 ^ 2\\\\ + \\lambda_3\\cdot\\max_{1\\le j \\le m}\\left[d_{ij}p_j(t)r_j(t)\\right ] \\end{split } \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] coupling constant @xmath5 ( speed of feeding ) and @xmath8 ( sensitivity ) are random positive reals normalized to unity and fixed during simulation , while @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 describe intensities of the three terms .",
    "the constants @xmath12 are equal to one for active agents and to zero in other case . at the beginning , all agents are active , but once @xmath6 is negative for given @xmath2 , @xmath12 is switched to zero and the @xmath2-th agent is eliminated from the game .",
    "we deal with a set of differential equations which are piecewisely continuous . at the moments of time @xmath13 when @xmath14 for any up - to - now - active agent @xmath2 , the equations are switched from one analytical solution to another one . in this sense ,",
    "the formalism is equivalent to a coupled map lattice , but the number of equations changes in time .",
    "similar approach was applied already in @xcite .",
    "note however that in our case , the maps are to be integrated numerically .",
    "we consider two different neighbourhoods : ( i ) each individual has @xmath3 randomly chosen neighbours , or ( ii ) each individual has @xmath3 nearest geometrical neighbours . in the latter case , the agents form a one - dimensional chain with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "note that the formed network of agents is a continuous analogue to the kauffman model @xcite , designed for a simulation of genetic systems .",
    "we solve numerically and check how the kind of neighbourhood , the number of directly interacting agents @xmath3 and the strengths of interactions influence ( i ) time evolution of the average power ( ii ) and number of active agents after very long times .",
    "the simulation is started with @xmath15 active agents ( @xmath16 for @xmath17 ) , each with randomly chosen initial power @xmath18 .",
    "the simulation takes @xmath19 time steps , each @xmath20 long , what guarantees the numerical stability .",
    "\\(a ) + ( b )",
    "two subsequent stages of the time evolution can be observed independently of kind of neighbourhood ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "initially , the average power increases distinctly , but its distribution becomes wide . after some transient time , however , resources are exhausted .",
    "richness of some agents falls to zero and they are eliminated .",
    "cooperation becomes less effective , what leads to subsequent falls .",
    "finally , small percent of agents survive in a steady state .",
    "distinct differences are found between the cases of geometrical and random neighbourhood ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . for the case of random neighbours ,",
    "usually only one agent survives , @xmath21 .",
    "this simplifies eq .",
    "to @xmath22 what gives subsequent power decrease of the last agent as @xmath23 .",
    "if two or more cooperating agents survive , we are faced with a set of nonlinear equations .",
    "analytically , a simplified case can be considered , when @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "then , the average power tends to a positive stable fixed point .",
    "numerical results suggest , that this is the rule also in the general case ( fig . [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the marked difference between the results for random and geometrical neighborhoods is an illustration of the old truth _ do ut des_. in other words , it is better to help friends which can reward than to people randomly selected in the street .",
    "a group of agents feeding each other can survive , if they spend resources moderately enough .",
    "a kind of an equilibrium with a given environment seems to be possible for the geometrical neighborhood , as long as the verhulst term is compensated by the remaining terms in eq . .",
    ".the percentage of the society s successes for geometrical neighbourhood and various sets of @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath15 , @xmath19 , @xmath29 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the results given above refer to the case of the geometrical neighborhood .",
    "let us define as a success of a society the case when more than one cooperating agents survive .",
    "then , tab .",
    "[ tab1 ] gives the percentage of successes for various sets of @xmath26 .",
    "it is astonishing ( at least for us ) that the roles of these two terms ( first and third ) in the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "differ so much .",
    "actually , both these terms are designed to increase the power of a given agent .",
    "the difference is only that the third term is a kind of local optimization , while the first one is automatic .",
    "it seems that this kind of dynamic reaction of a given agent is particularly relevant at the border of `` death '' ( or `` bankruptcy '' or so ) , when @xmath6 is close to zero .",
    "average power in asymptotic time , presented in tab .",
    "[ tab2 ] , does not show this effect .",
    "there , both terms act in the same way and can be mutually replaced to get approximately the same result .",
    "we are somewhat surprised with the fury of crisis , which can be observed in fig .",
    "simultaneously , distinct but continuous progress of the average power is substituted by wild oscillations , and the number of agents is strongly reduced .",
    "the effect arises abruptly , without any preceding warnings in the curve shape .",
    "soon , unavoidable elimination of almost all agents is observed for all applied sets of input parameters .",
    "we imagine the model as a parabolic description of the process of breaking of bonds and a destruction of a complex system .",
    "we feel that in this text , full of analogies , we are at the border of abuse of language .",
    "we apologize for that .",
    "however , we have found that it is particularly difficult to describe a transient process in precise terms of statistical physics , most of them designed for stationary processes .",
    "our process could be treated as stationary , if we allow the population of agents to be slowly reproduced , maybe with retaining some fruitful information , and the whole story is repeated many times .",
    "this kind of investigation could link to a penna - like model @xcite and to some kind of self - organization @xcite of the structure and strength of bonds between agents .",
