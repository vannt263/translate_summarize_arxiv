    "from recent cosmological observations , inflation appears to be the most successful cosmological model giving the large scale structure of the universe that existed in the very early universe .",
    "current observations of the temperature anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) suggest that an inflationary universe is consistent with the present universe .",
    "although it is not always necessary , a typical slow - roll condition is an important ingredient for the inflationary scenario .",
    "considering slow - roll inflation , there are two possible dynamics scenarios for velocity damping : the original ( supercooled ) inflation scenario in which the friction is induced by the hubble parameter , and the so - called warm inflation scenario in which a strong diffusion produces significant friction for the inflaton motion@xcite . in the strongly dissipative warm inflation ( sdwi )",
    "scenario , dissipative effects dominate the friction term . if the dissipation is not so strong as to dominate the friction term while the radiation production occurs concurrently during the inflationary period@xcite , this scenario is termed the weakly dissipative warm inflation ( wdwi ) scenario .",
    "the conventional criteria for discriminating warm inflation from supercooled inflation is not @xmath0 in the friction term but @xmath1 for the temperature during inflation , where @xmath2 denote the damping rate , hubble parameter and temperature . in this paper",
    "we consider the significant thermal effect of the radiation created during warm inflation , for both sdwi ( @xmath0 ) and wdwi ( @xmath3 ) scenarios .",
    "two different sources are considered for the radiation : one is supplied continuously from the inflaton field , and the other is supplied temporarily from the phase transition and the decay in the remote sector .",
    "originally , the spectrum of the cosmological perturbations created during inflation has been expected to be scale - invariant and gaussian .",
    "however , recent observations may suggest that small anomalies are significant in the spectrum , such as a small departure from exact scale - invariance and a certain non - gaussian character @xcite , both of which can help reveal the underlying theory based on the expected form of the inflationary action .",
    "in particular , observation of a tiny shift in the spectrum index @xmath4 is an obvious example@xcite of scale invariance violation that can be used to determine the strict form of the inflaton potential for the inflation scenario .",
    "observation of non - gaussian character in the spectrum may lead to a significant bound for the mechanism of generating curvature perturbations . determining how these anomalies arise and how they are related to the inflation dynamics and also to the generating mechanism of the cosmological perturbations",
    "will depend on the cosmological model and the character of the underlying theory . in order to explain how these anomalies are explained , there are already many models of inflation and the generating mechanism of the curvature perturbations , in which the spectrum is generated ( 1 ) during inflation @xcite , ( 2 ) at the end of inflation @xcite , ( 3 ) after inflation by preheating@xcite and reheating@xcite or ( 4 ) late after inflation by curvatons @xcite or by inhomogeneous phase transition@xcite",
    "the idea of inhomogeneous phase transition is very useful and unifies inhomogeneous scenarios , as it explains density perturbations from a spatially inhomogeneous transition accompanied by a gap in the scaling relation ; namely @xmath5 with @xmath6 , where @xmath7 denotes the cosmic - scale factor .",
    "for example , @xmath8 and @xmath9 reproduces inhomogeneous reheating@xcite and creation of perturbations at the end of inflation@xcite , respectively . in this paper",
    "we consider ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , namely the creation of the curvature perturbations during inflation and at the end of inflation .",
    "however , contrary to the conventional model , the inhomogeneities at the end of inflation are not induced by the fluctuations of the end - boundary of the inflaton field ( @xmath10 ) but by the inhomogeneous phase transition in the remote sector based on spatial inhomogeneities of the critical temperature ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "recently , the origin of the cosmological perturbations in warm inflation has been revealed in ref.@xcite . in this paper , we follow the discussions in ref.@xcite . in warm inflation ,",
    "the effective potential of the inflaton fields @xmath12 depends on temperature @xmath13 , which can be expressed as @xmath14 .",
    "the damping rate @xmath15 of the inflaton fields may also depend on @xmath13 and @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , the `` trajectory '' of warm inflation is generally given by inflaton fields @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "there may be multiple trajectories for inflation , and the correct one can not be chosen independent of the initial condition that is generally given by @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the end - boundary of inflation may also be determined by @xmath16 and @xmath13 .",
    "the situation is similar to multi - field models of inflation .    to compare the situations for multi - field inflation and warm inflation , first consider two - field inflation with a fast - rolling inflaton @xmath17 that reaches its minimum during inflation .",
    "we assume that the slow - rolling inflaton @xmath16 couples to the trigger field in the hybrid - type potential and this field determines the end of inflation .",
    "in this case , the fluctuation of the e - foldings number @xmath18 is expected to be given by @xmath19 and @xmath20 , which naturally leads to@xcite @xmath21 however , for multi - field inflation the usual definition of the curvature perturbations on spatially flat hypersurfaces is given by using @xmath22(density ) , @xmath23(pressure ) and @xmath24(momentum perturbation ) . following the standard definition of the curvature perturbations ,",
    "the curvature perturbations are found to be given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 on the steep potential is assumed . in this case , the evolution during inflation ( @xmath27 ) is crucial .",
    "namely , at a `` bend '' in the inflation trajectory , where the fast - rolling field @xmath17 reaches its minimum , the correction caused by the multi - field evolution is given by @xmath28 which is consistent with the naive expectation given in eq.([bai - ve ] ) .",
    "see also ref.@xcite for an alternative approach .",
    "a similar situation appears in strongly dissipating warm inflation , in which the curvature perturbation is given by formula based on @xmath19 and @xmath20 . ]",
    "@xmath29 again , the evolution during inflation is crucial , since from the time - integral of a decaying component we find @xcite , @xmath30 one might think that the result is trivial when the number of e - foldings is determined exclusively by the inflaton .",
    "however , just as in multi - field inflation where the significant evolution of the curvature perturbation is important , in warm inflation the evolution of the curvature perturbation is very important . ) . for simplicity ,",
    "the correction from the perturbations of the radiation is not considered in this paper , although it is important in warm inflation . ]    from the langevin equation , the root - mean square fluctuation amplitude of the inflaton field @xmath19 after the freeze out is obtained to be@xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the ratio between @xmath13 and @xmath33 , defined by @xmath34 , which is assumed to be @xmath35 during warm inflation .",
    "the strength of the thermal damping is measured by the rate @xmath36 given by @xmath37 which can be used to rewrite the field equation as @xmath38 for sdwi , the curvature perturbations created during warm inflation are thus determined by the equation @xmath39 for wdwi , it is given by @xmath40 here we used @xmath41 , which is explained in the next section .",
    "an interesting property is expected from the above equations .",
    "for remote inflation , one may naturally expect that many fields are in thermal equilibrium and stay in their false vacuum states .",
    "if there is a cascading symmetry breaking in the remote sector as @xmath13 evolves during inflation , it raises a gap in the hubble parameter .",
    "this may cause a transition from wdwi to sdwi , or simply a gap in the parameters @xmath36 and @xmath32 . assuming instant decay in the remote sector",
    ", @xmath13 may have a gap ( sudden increase ) at the transition .",
    "this may happen if the energy released by the transition ( @xmath42 ) raises the effective temperature @xmath13 for @xmath43 .",
    "otherwise , one may assume that the change of the temperature @xmath13 is negligible because of the slow - decay , and @xmath44 is a constant at the transition .",
    "even if both @xmath13 and @xmath44 are constant at the transition , a gap in the curvature perturbation may appear from the gap in the hubble parameter .",
    "we investigate these interesting possibilities in this paper .",
    "more significantly , the hubble parameter may decrease with a large ratio @xmath45 if the major part of the remote sector decays .",
    "then , the increase of @xmath36 and @xmath32 caused by the shift of the hubble parameter leads to the amplification ( or suppression ) of the scalar perturbation .    for example",
    ", we consider the simplest case in which the radiation released from the remote sector is not significant due to the slow - decay , but the shift of the hubble parameter is not negligible . for wdwi ( @xmath46 ) ,",
    "the curvature perturbation is given by @xmath47 for sdwi ( @xmath48 ) it is given by @xmath49 these equations show that the curvature perturbation is suppressed at the gap .",
    "note that a transition from wdwi to sdwi is also possible at the gap .",
    "contrary to scalar perturbations , tensor perturbations do not couple strongly to the thermal background .",
    "gravitational waves are thus generated by quantum fluctuations as in standard ( supercooled ) inflation@xcite .",
    "we thus find @xmath50 which decreases at the gap . here",
    "the `` gap '' is not always assumed to be large .",
    "it may appear as a few percent of @xmath13 and @xmath33 to create a mild scale - dependence .",
    "for the second example , we consider a gap characterized by @xmath51 with the explicit form of the damping rate given by @xmath52 .",
    "if a small part of the false - vacuum energy is released by the phase transition caused by a field in the multi - field remote sector , the gap in the hubble parameter is negligible but the gap in the temperature can be significant . since the damping rate depends explicitly on the temperature , the gap is accompanied by an increase in the damping rate . using @xmath53 , there is a change in the curvature perturbations @xmath54 which may lead to a significant amplification of the curvature perturbations at the corresponding cosmological scale .",
    "the amplification , if it exists in the observable scale , may appear as a temporal peak in the spectrum .",
    "the tail of the peak is determined by the inflation attractor .",
    "finally , we note that the gap in the temperature caused by the phase transition in the remote sector may * appear even if the energy density during inflation is not dominated by the remote sector . * in this sense , the gap in the temperature is a common and very important phenomenon in warm inflation , which requires further study .",
    "details of these topics are discussed in sec.2 .",
    "in conventional hybrid inflation , the typical form of the hybrid - type potential is given by @xmath55 the vacuum energy during inflation is @xmath56 , which is defined by the false vacuum @xmath57 and @xmath58 . here",
    "the critical point is defined by @xmath59 because of the condition @xmath58 , the motion of the inflaton field must obey `` roll - in '' motion @xmath60 .",
    "another possibility for realizing hybrid inflation is to consider `` roll - out '' motion of the inflaton field considering a non - trivial form of the couplings .",
    "the scenario that realizes `` roll - out '' motion is called the inverted scenario of hybrid inflation@xcite .",
    "the conditions related to the roll - in and roll - out motion are usually used to restrict inflaton potential .",
    "therefore , removing the conditions for hybrid inflation related to `` roll - in '' and `` roll - out '' is useful .",
    "a natural construction of the hybrid - type potential in the string theory is to consider brane distance as the inflaton .",
    "the trigger field may be a tachyon that appears in the collision of a brane anti - brane pair@xcite , or a field localized on the target wall@xcite .",
    "a thermal effect can cause an attractive force between branes , which can be used to construct thermal brane inflation@xcite , and to construct models of brane inflation based on defect inflation scenario@xcite and brane inflation with roll - out motion @xcite .",
    "although brane inflation is not discussed explicitly in this paper , application of the remote inflation scenario to brane inflation is an attractive idea .",
    "contrary to conventional hybrid inflation , either normal , inverted or brane - motivated , remote inflation does not have direct couplings between inflaton and trigger fields .",
    "namely , remote inflation is a kind of hybrid - like inflation but it does not have the so - called hybrid - type potential .",
    "the trigger fields @xmath61 are placed in a remote sector and stays in their false vacuum states during inflation , but they do not have direct couplings with the inflaton field @xmath16 . these trigger fields can stay in their false vacuum states because of the thermal effect from the background radiation . the background radiation is negligible in supercooled inflation , but it may have a significant effect in warm ( @xmath62 ) inflation .",
    "a typical situation is shown in figure 1 , in which either roll - in or roll - out potential for inflaton are considered .    ( 200,300)(100,170 )    [ fig : mass - dom ]    in order to show how slow - roll inflation is realized in the warm inflation scenario , we first consider a homogeneous inflaton field interacting with thermal radiation@xcite .",
    "the thermodynamic potential is given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the effective number of thermal particles .",
    "the evolution equation for the inflaton field is given by @xmath65 where @xmath44 is the damping term and @xmath33 is the expansion rate of the universe . here",
    "the subscript denotes the derivative with respect to the field .",
    "the strength of the thermal damping is measured by the rate @xmath36 given by @xmath66 , which can be used to rewrite the field equation as @xmath38 the strongly dissipating phase of warm inflaton is defined by @xmath67 .",
    "the production of entropy during inflation is caused by the dissipation of the inflaton motion , where the entropy @xmath68 is defined by the thermodynamic equation ; @xmath69 where the subscript denotes the derivative with respect to the temperature . for our calculation",
    ", we need explicit forms of the energy density @xmath22 and the pressure @xmath70 , which are given by @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the contribution from the kinetic term of the inflaton field , and the friedman equation follows @xmath73 here we assumed that inflaton has the standard kinetic term .",
    "the slow - roll approximation is very useful in estimating the order of magnitude of the physical quantities : @xmath74 where the second equation is obtained from the evolution equation for the radiation energy density .",
    "the slow - roll trajectory of inflation for @xmath16 and @xmath13 is determined by eqs.([slou ] ) and ( [ rel - warm ] ) .",
    "the gauge - invariant combinations for the curvature perturbation are defined by @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the momentum perturbation satisfying @xmath77 here @xmath78 is the perturbation of the comoving density , satisfying the evolution equation @xmath79 where @xmath80 is related to the shear perturbation and assumed to be finite . from the above definitions ,",
    "@xmath81 hypersurfaces are identified with uniform density hypersurfaces ( @xmath82 ) at large scales due to the relation @xmath83 , where these two definitions of the curvature perturbation are identified ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "we considered linear scalar perturbations of a friedman - robertson - walker(frw ) background : @xmath85dx^i dx^j.\\ ] ] using the above definitions based on the energy - momentum , we find that the comoving curvature perturbation created during warm inflaton on spatially flat hypersurfaces @xmath86 is expressed as @xmath87 the result is obviously much smaller than the result expected from the perturbation of the number of e - foldings based on @xmath19 and @xmath20 , which is given by @xmath88 as we discussed in sec.1 , a similar situation appears for multi - field inflation , and the solution to this problem is given by the evolution of the curvature perturbations .",
    "namely , for multi - field inflation a significant evolution at the `` bend '' in the trajectory leads to @xmath89 which recovers the expected form of the curvature perturbations based on @xmath19 and @xmath20 . for warm inflation",
    ", a significant evolution appears from the time - integral of a decaying component in the evolution equation .",
    "again , it leads to the result consistent with the expectation based on @xmath19 and @xmath20 . in this paper",
    ", we thus consider that the curvature perturbations created during warm inflation are given by @xmath90 which is used without mentioning the origin .",
    "an important source of density perturbations in warm inflation is thermal fluctuations , which causes significant difference from supercooled inflation .",
    "namely , a comoving mode of thermal fluctuations during warm inflation is created by thermal noise , which can lead to significant field perturbations @xmath91 .",
    "the behavior of a scalar field interacting with radiation can be studied by using the langevin equation @xmath92 where @xmath93 denotes a source of stochastic noise . from the langevin equation , the root - mean square fluctuation amplitude of the inflaton field @xmath19 after the freeze is obtained .",
    "it is given by a simplified form @xmath94 for the typical ( @xmath95 ) warm inflation , and @xmath96 for weakly dissipating ( @xmath97 ) warm inflation .",
    "using the relation given in eq,([rel - warm ] ) , the scalar curvature perturbation is expressed as @xmath98 cosmological perturbations created during remote inflation are calculated using these basic equations of warm inflation .",
    "remote inflation requires symmetry restoration in the remote sector , which is caused by the radiation dissipated from the inflaton . to illustrate some typical features of finite temperature effects in the remote sector , here we consider a real scalar field and a potential : @xmath99 where @xmath100 is tuned so that the cosmological constant vanishes at the true minimum .",
    "the phenomenon of high - temperature symmetry restoration can be understood by the finite - temperature effective potential given by @xcite @xmath101,\\ ] ] where @xmath102 is the one - loop potential for zero - temperature with the classical field @xmath103 : @xmath104 where @xmath105 is a renormalization mass scale . at high temperatures",

    "assuming that the couplings of @xmath110 to the fields in the background thermal bath are more significant than the self - coupling , we obtain a typical form of the potential with a thermal correction term , which is given by @xmath111 where @xmath112 denotes the effective coupling of @xmath110 to the fields in the thermal bath . in this case , the critical temperature is given by @xmath113 in this paper , we assume that the couplings to the background fields are significant and @xmath114 is always given by @xmath115 .",
    "we define the critical temperature for the fields in the remote sector by @xmath116 .    since the false - vacuum energy in the remote sector determines the energy scale of inflation , @xmath100 in eq.([ini - the ] )",

    "we find @xmath119 since the false - vacuum energy @xmath100 in the remote sector must dominate the energy density during warm inflation , we have a condition @xmath120 , which leads to a simple equation @xmath121    it is also interesting to consider if a phase transition in the remote sector occurs during a warm inflationary phase characterized by @xmath62 .",
    "the condition for the phase transition is given by @xmath122 , which leads to @xmath123 then , a condition @xmath124 is obtained .    for @xmath125",
    ", the phase transition may occur in supercooled inflation .",
    "if the radiation is not supplied concurrently from the inflaton , the model becomes thermal inflation@xcite .",
    "more generally , we may consider an effective symmetry in the remote sector , which forbids ( or reduces ) the quartic interaction . in this case",
    "the potential is given by @xmath126 the condition for the false - vacuum domination @xmath120 leads to @xmath127    again , from @xmath128 , we obtain an obvious condition for the phase transition ; @xmath129    in standard inflation , the end of inflation is determined by @xmath130 , where the slow - roll condition is violated at @xmath131 .",
    "the end - boundary of remote inflation is determined by either @xmath130 or @xmath114 .",
    "if @xmath16 reaches @xmath130 ahead of @xmath13 , the situation is precisely the same as the conventional warm inflation . however , if @xmath13 reaches @xmath114 ahead of @xmath16 , @xmath114 in the remote sector determines the end of inflation .",
    "also , if there is an inhomogeneous phase transition@xcite in the remote sector , it causes an inhomogeneous end of warm inflation .",
    "contrary to the usual scenario of generating curvature perturbations at the end of inflation@xcite , here a model is considered in which the inhomogeneities are not caused by the inflaton - field perturbations at the end ( @xmath132 ) , but by the spatial inhomogeneities of the critical temperature ( @xmath133 ) in the remote sector . here",
    "the sources of the inhomogeneities are light fields ( moduli ) in the model , which determines the value of @xmath112 and @xmath134 . from the definition of the critical temperature",
    ", we find @xmath135 which does not vanish if @xmath134 or @xmath112 are determined by the vacuum expectation values of light fields , which obtain cosmological fluctuations at the horizon exit .",
    "the effect can be used to add significant non - gaussianity to the spectrum , but to find the explicit form of the curvature perturbations we must solve @xmath136 at the end of warm inflation .",
    "since the calculation is highly model - dependent and requires numerical study , we do not discuss details of this issue in this paper .",
    "however , from a heuristic argument we can estimate the magnitude of the correction by @xmath137 \\sim \\frac{\\phi}{\\dot{\\phi}}\\left[\\frac{\\delta t_c}{t_c}\\right ] \\sim \\frac{\\phi}{\\delta \\phi}\\left[\\frac{\\delta \\phi}{\\dot{\\phi}}\\right ] \\left[\\frac{\\delta t_c}{t_c}\\right],\\ ] ] which can be large .",
    "here we assumed that @xmath13 is given by a polynomial of @xmath16 , assuming that @xmath138 and @xmath139 with the inflaton potential given by @xmath140 .",
    "the creation of the curvature perturbations caused by the inhomogeneous phase transition in the remote sector is thus important for the calculation of the curvature perturbations and its anomalies in the spectrum .",
    "the essence of remote inflation is discussed in the previous section considering the typical situation with single - field remote sector . at the horizon exit ,",
    "the single - field model discussed above creates the same spectrum as the conventional warm inflation .",
    "however , for the creation of the cosmological perturbations at the inhomogeneous end of inflation , the inhomogeneous phase transition in the remote sector may leave a significant signature in the spectrum . therefore , the creation of the perturbations at the end of inflation is important in distinguishing the model .    as we will show in this subsection , the significance of remote inflation is more apparent in its multi - field extension , where the gaps caused by the phase transitions in the remote sector may leave significant signatures in the spectrum . in general , generation of gaps and peaks in the spectrum",
    "is difficult in conventional inflation .",
    "we thus believe that observations of these signatures are important clues to remote inflation .",
    "more precisely , in standard inflation , gap generation is caused by non - trivial interactions that become significant at a critical point @xmath141 .",
    "otherwise , the gap in the spectrum is explained by the gap in the inflaton potential .",
    "these mechanisms are highly model - dependent and require many additional sources for the critical point .",
    "therefore , we believe that our idea , in which the gap is caused by the critical temperature , is more attractive than the usual scenarios .    the effect from the phase transition in the multi - field remote sector can be categorized in the following ways .",
    "1 .   @xmath142 and @xmath143 , where the major component in the remote sector decays and supplies significant radiation .",
    "2 .   @xmath144 and @xmath145 , where the major component in the remote sector decays but due to the slow - decay it does not raise the temperature .",
    "3 .   @xmath142 and @xmath146 , where a minor component in the remote sector decays and quickly thermalizes during inflation .",
    "note that the vacuum - energy domination by the remote sector is not necessary for the situation .",
    "( i.e. , the situation is based on a small phase transition in a remote sector , which can appear in conventional warm inflation . )",
    "the conditions for the situations and the expected corrections to the curvature perturbations are discussed in the followings , using an explicit form of @xmath44 : @xmath147 .    in this case , the component in the remote sector that decays at the phase transition has dominated the false - vacuum energy until the phase transition .",
    "we consider the situation in which the peak of the temperature ( @xmath148 ) caused by the phase transition exceeds the temperature before the phase transition , but the decay is not so fast as to dominate the energy density of the universe .",
    "denoting the cosmological quantities before and after the phase transition by the subscripts @xmath149 and @xmath150 , the condition is given by @xmath151 . because of the gap in the hubble parameter , the ratios @xmath34 and @xmath152 increase after the gap .",
    "moreover , the supplement of the radiation from the remote sector enhances @xmath153 and @xmath53 just after the gap .",
    "here we consider the damping rate @xmath44 that is defined by @xmath154 where @xmath155 is the constant determined by the number of fields and the channels for the decay@xcite . for simplicity , we introduce rates defined by @xmath156 we thus find @xmath157 which lead to the ratio of the curvature perturbations @xmath158 which show that in wdwi the gap always causes suppression of the curvature perturbation , while in sdwi amplification / suppression is determined by the model .",
    "this typical characteristic feature can be used to distinguish sdwi from wdwi .",
    "if the enhancement of @xmath44 is significant , the situation with @xmath159 is possible . the instant transition from wdwi to sdwi leads to @xmath160 again , the gap may cause either suppression or amplification .    in this case",
    ", the component in the remote sector that decays at the phase transition has dominated the false - vacuum energy , but the creation of the radiation from the phase transition is very slow and thus the temperature is not raised significantly after the phase transition .",
    "therefore , we find @xmath161 and @xmath162 in this situation .",
    "we thus find @xmath163 which lead to the curvature perturbations @xmath164 which show that in both cases the gap causes suppression of the curvature perturbation .",

    "we consider the situation in which the peak of the temperature ( @xmath148 ) caused by the phase transition exceeds the temperature before the phase transition . because there is no significant gap in the hubble parameter",
    ", the ratio @xmath166 is given by @xmath167 and can be neglected .",
    "the creation of the radiation from the remote sector enhances @xmath153 and @xmath53 just after the gap , which leads to @xmath168 .",
    "we thus find @xmath169 which lead to the curvature perturbations @xmath170 which show that for both wdwi and sdwi the gap always causes significant amplification of the curvature perturbation .",
    "if the enhancement of @xmath44 is significant , the situation with @xmath159 is possible .",
    "the instant transition from wdwi to sdwi leads to @xmath171      from the evolution equation for the radiation energy density , the radiation concurrently created from the inflaton is given by @xmath172 assuming that @xmath36 is given by the standard form @xmath173 , the above equation gives @xmath174 which show that the temporal increase in the radiation energy density caused by the decay in the remote sector leads to ( 1 ) enhancement of @xmath175 in wdwi or ( 2 ) suppression of @xmath175 in sdwi . as a result ,",
    "the tail of the gap ( the typical time - length of the diffusion ) in wdwi is typically longer than in sdwi .    considering the attractor of the trajectory @xmath176 from the equations of warm inflation given in this section , finding two independent solutions is possible , although it depends on the details of the inflaton potential .",
    "the transition between different trajectories is usually disregarded because it is quite unlikely in conventional warm inflation . however , in remote inflation the transition from a low - temperature trajectory to a high - temperature trajectory may occur after the phase transition in the remote sector .",
    "the phase transition in the remote sector may also cause significant change in the hubble parameter that may also lead to the change of the trajectory .      besides the complexities of the decaying process in the remote sector , production of cosmological defects during inflation may leave significant signatures in the spectrum@xcite .",
    "an interesting possibility that may arise in the context of an inflationary scenario@xcite is that monopoles are formed during inflation but are not completely inflated away .",
    "then , at the confinement phase transition after inflation , strings connecting monopoles ( or necklaces ) are formed , whose length is initially much longer than the hubble radius .",
    "such strings may leave significant cosmological signatures@xcite , such as dark matter and primordial black holes . besides strings and monopoles and their hybrids@xcite , cosmological domain walls",
    "may also appear when a discrete symmetry is broken at the phase transition .",
    "the creation of cosmological domain walls may cause serious cosmological problem .",
    "cosmological domain walls can decay safely before domination if they are made unstable by a bias between the quasi - degenerated vacua , which can be induced by an effective interaction term that breaks the discrete symmetry .",
    "note that for supergravity , domain walls caused by the r - symmetry are naturally safe because the supergravity interaction causes the required bias @xcite .",
    "however , the instability caused by the explicit breaking term may not work effectively to erase these domain walls before domination , because the typical distance between domain walls created during inflation is much larger than the hubble radius .",
    "namely , the distance between domain walls may still be larger than the hubble radius at the time when they must decay for successful cosmology .",
    "this condition puts a trivial bound on the cosmological time of the domain - wall creation during inflation . on the other hand ,",
    "if such domain walls are generated sufficiently late during the inflationary epoch and decay safely before domination , they can be used to create significant amplification of the small - scale density perturbations .",
    "these topological defects ( monopoles , strings , domain walls and others@xcite ) may put bounds on the phase transition , but at the same time they can be used to create dark matter candidates , primordial black holes and small - scale density perturbations .",
    "in this paper we proposed a new scenario of hybrid - like inflation .",
    "in remote inflation , radiation raised continuously by a dissipating inflaton field causes symmetry restoration in a remote sector , and the false - vacuum energy of the remote sector dominates the energy density during inflation .",
    "the situation is similar to hybrid inflation , but the hybrid - type potential is not required in this scenario .",
    "remote inflation is terminated when the temperature reaches the critical temperature , or when the slow - roll condition is violated .",
    "of course , the scenario is identical to thermal inflation if the radiation is not supplied by the inflaton . without introducing additional couplings , the inflaton field may roll - out like an inverted - hybrid model or quintessential inflation .",
    "significant signatures of remote inflation can be observed in the spectrum . for a single - field remote sector ,",
    "the difference is caused by the inhomogeneous phase transition in the remote sector .",
    "for multi - field extension of the remote sector , successive phase transition is possible and it may cause significant difference in the spectrum .",
    "remote inflation can predict strong amplification or suppression of small - scale perturbations , which may appear without introducing multiple inflation . note that the phase transition in the remote sector is possible during standard warm inflaton , irrespective of the domination by the false - vacuum energy in the remote sector .    the inflaton field may have a run - away potential , which can be identified with quintessential potential . in this sense ,",
    "the idea of remote inflation also provides a hybrid - type extension of quintessential inflation .    for definiteness , we consider a concrete model of single field inflation with quartic potential and calculate the curvature perturbations and the spectral index of the model .",
    "note first that the spectrum of remote inflation is basically the same as the warm inflation with the hybrid - type potential .",
    "the potential of the model is given by @xmath177 where @xmath100 is the false - vacuum energy of the remote sector .",
    "here we consider a flat potential with @xmath178 .",
    "we consider the damping rate @xmath44 ; @xmath179 for strongly dissipating phase , the slow - roll velocity is given by @xmath180 which leads to the temperature during warm inflation @xmath181 here @xmath182 is the stefan - boltzmann constant .",
    "a useful expression is @xmath183 from these equations , the curvature perturbation is obtained as @xmath184 obviously , a tiny @xmath185 is required for warm inflation .",
    "note that remote inflation works without the hybrid - type potential and may solve problems in supercooled inflation , however it can not be free of the conditions related to warm inflation . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the spectral index of the curvature perturbations in warm inflation has been studied for general form of the dissipative coefficient .",
    "the straightforward calculation of the spectral index using the useful expression in ref.@xcite gives @xmath186\\sim\\frac{3}{7}\\frac{\\eta}{r},\\ ] ] where @xmath187 is given by @xmath188 the running of the spectral index for this model gives @xmath189@xcite .",
    "is allowed for the running of the spectral index @xmath190@xcite . ]    a more interesting and realistic application of remote inflation will be discussed in ref.@xcite .",
