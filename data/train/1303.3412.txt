    "a spin ensemble controlled by disturbed kick train is subject to different dynamical effects : decoherence , relaxation , population oscillations , population jumps and horizons of coherence ( for the chaotic case ) .",
    "these different phenomena can be controlled to a certain extend by adjust the system parameters as summarizes table [ control ] .",
    "chaotic kick baths are particularly interesting since they present two distinct behaviors . at short - term",
    "the spin ensemble presents a behavior without decoherence and relaxation processes whereas at long - term decoherence and relaxation processes dominate the dynamics .",
    "spin ensembles chaotically kicked present then a _ horizon of coherence _ which is a quantum analogue to the horizons of predictability of chaotic classical systems and which is a direct consequence of the sensitivity to initial conditions into the kick bath .",
    "an interesting question could be to know if similar behaviors occur for quantum baths in contact with other kinds of classical baths .",

    "<S> we study the dynamics of a quantum spin ensemble controlled by trains of ultrashort pulses . to model disturbances of the kicks , we consider that the spins are submitted to different kick trains which follow regular , random , stochastic or chaotic dynamical processes . these are described by dynamical systems on a torus . </S>",
    "<S> we study the quantum decoherence and the population relaxation of the spin ensemble induced by these classical dynamical processes disturbing the kick trains . for chaotic kick trains </S>",
    "<S> we show that the decoherence and the relaxation processes exhibit a signature of chaos directly related to the lyapunov exponents of the dynamical system . </S>",
