    "thirty years ago , in a very influential paper , witten @xcite discussed the bubble dynamics , assuming that the cosmic qcd phase transition is of the first order . among other things , he pointed out that bubble coalescence or collisions produce inhomogeneities of the energy density , which lead to the gravity waves ( gw ) production .",

    "@xmath19 where @xmath20 is the planck mass and @xmath21 is the effective number of bosonic degrees of freedom ( see details in , e.g. , particle data group big bang cosmology ) .    plugging in the corresponding @xmath22 , one finds the time of the qcd phase transition to be @xmath23 and electroweak @xmath24 . multiplying those times by the respective redshift factors",
    ", one finds that the @xmath25 scale today corresponds to about @xmath26 year , and the electroweak to @xmath27 hours .",
    "the cosmological horizon provides a natural infrared cutoff on the gravitational radiation wavelength . at the radiation - dominated era",
    ", it is inversely proportional to time , so the estimates above give a cutoff on the periods of the gravitational waves in the present time .",
    "gws from the electroweak era are expected to be searched for by future space gw observatories such as elisa : discussion of their potential sensitivity can be found elsewhere .",
    "the observational tools for the gw at the period scale of @xmath28 are based on the long - term monitoring of the millisecond pulsar phases , with subsequent correlation between all of them .",
    "the basic idea is that when the gw is falling on earth and , say , stretches distances in a certain direction , then in the orthogonal direction , one expects distances to be contracted .",
    "the binary correlation function for the pulsar time delay is an expected function of the angle @xmath29 between them on the sky .",
    "there are existing collaborations ",
    "north american nanohertz observatory for gravitational radiation , european pulsar timing array ( epta ) , and parkes pulsar timing array  which actively pursue both searching for new millisecond pulsars and collecting the timing data for some known pulsars .",
    "it is believed that about 200 known millisecond pulsars constitute only about 1% percent of their total number in our galaxy .",
    "we also note that the current bound on the gw energy density for the frequencies of interest , @xmath30 , is @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is , as usual , the total energy density of the gw relative to the critical energy density and @xmath33    this bound should constrain possible models of the gw production in the early universe .",
    "[ note that at the time of the qcd ( ew ) transition , @xmath34 is about 4 ( 15 ) orders of magnitude larger due to its dependence on the scaling factor @xmath35 , so the aforementioned limit is weaker for those times . ]",
    "rapid progress in the field , including better pulsar timing and formation of a global collaboration of observers , is expected to improve the sensitivity of the method , perhaps making it possible in a few - year time scale to detect gw radiation , either from the qcd big bang gw radiation we discuss or from colliding supermassive black holes .",
    "for comparison , let us start with the little bang  heavy - ion collision . as",
    "one of us suggested many years ago @xcite , production of penetrating probes  photons and dileptons  not only provide a look inside the quark - gluon plasma , but is even somewhat enhanced .",
    "the rate of , e.g. , photon production due to the strong compton scattering and annihilation @xmath36 is @xmath37 and thus the photon accumulated density normalized to the entropy density of matter @xmath38 is of the order of @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the fireball lifetime .",
    "the small qed and qcd coupling constants in front are thus partly compensated by large @xmath41 , called the `` macro - to - micro ratio '' , which will repeatedly appear below .",
    "this factor represents a long accumulation time of the photon production , and it is about 1 order of magnitude in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "similar logic holds for the gravitational radiation from matter constituents .",
    "the characteristic microscale of the plasma is its temperature @xmath22 . at the thermal ( the high - frequency ) end of the spectrum , @xmath42 ,",
    "one finds the fraction of gw radiation to the total energy density @xmath43 to be given by a similar expression , @xmath44 where the first factor is the corresponding effective gravitational coupling , which is very small since @xmath45 in our case .",
    "the macro - to - micro factor is a large enhancement factor , which can be readily obtained from ( [ eqn_t ] ) and in fact contains an inverse of the ratio just mentioned ; thus , @xmath46 this factor can not , however , cancel all powers of @xmath20 in the coupling factor , so the gravitational radiation directly from plasma particles is strongly suppressed .",
    "while matter is mostly made of various partons with @xmath47 , it also contains long wavelength collective modes , the hydrodynamical sounds .",
    "thermal occupations of plasma partons are @xmath48 , but for sounds , even in equilibrium , their occupation factors for small frequencies are much larger , @xmath49 .",
    "out - of - equilibrium phenomena , which we study below , may produce much higher amplitudes of hydrodynamical perturbations at small @xmath2 , in the so - called _ inverse acoustic cascade_. the sound momenta and frequencies are , however , limited from below , and thus the sound intensities @xmath3 are limited as well .",
    "the most obvious infrared cutoff is by the inverse lifetime of the universe , @xmath50 : a more precise cutoff is due to a collision rate , which we discuss below .",
    "the sound conversion to the gw happens via a two - to - one transition , and therefore its rate is enhanced _ quadratically _",
    ", @xmath51 .",
    "the peak in the sound intensity squared will be repeated in the gw spectrum .",
    "the more it moves to the ir , the stronger the gw signal will be , and the better chances we have to eventually observe it .    summarizing this section ,",
    "only strongly enhanced out - of - equilibrium sounds may potentially produce an observable level of the gw .",
    "the task is to estimate the sound level at the ir end of the dynamical range . to illustrate how highly nontrivial it is",
    ", we recall that the loudest sounds on earth have nothing to do with the equilibrium conditions but rather with thunderstorms or earthquakes .",
    "the idea of turbulence , either driven or free , started from hydrodynamics of fluids .",
    "kolmogorov proposed the famous stationary power solutions . for the weak turbulence , governed by the boltzmann equation , such solutions were developed by vladimir zakharov and collaborators , to many different problems , as summarized in the book @xcite . a turbulent cascade in cosmology",
    "was suggested to appear after the preheating stage of inflation @xcite : for a scalar field with quartic self - interaction . however , that cascade is _ direct _ , propagating into uv , towards the large momenta @xmath2 .",
    "consideration of an _ inverse _ cascade to ir , similar to our case , was done for scalar theories @xcite as well as recently for gluons ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . the _ inverse acoustic cascade _ in the strong turbulence regime , to our knowledge , was never discussed before .",
    "the key features of our theory are nonlinear corrections to the sound dispersion law .",
    "we will use notations @xmath52 and assume that @xmath53 the sign of constant @xmath54 would lead to physically different scenarios due to different sound cascades .",
    "although the coefficient @xmath54 is not known for the sound near the qcd or ew phase transitions , it was derived for a strongly coupled plasma of the @xmath55=4 super - yang - mills theory , through the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "it is widely believed that those should be similar , at least qualitatively . without going into details ,",
    "the known terms in the sound dispersion curve , up to @xmath56 accuracy , are @xcite      where @xmath58 .",
    "the crucial observation is that the @xmath59 correction in the first bracket of ( [ symdisp ] ) has a @xmath60 coefficient .",
    "this allows for three - wave @xmath61 transitions between the sounds  in particular , a decay of a harder phonon into two softer ones .",
    "although this is , in principle , known , for completeness let us remind the kinematics of this process .",
    "the momentum conservation @xmath62 allows us to introduce a parameter @xmath63 $ ] and a vector @xmath64 such that @xmath65 will have longitudinal components along @xmath66 denoted by @xmath67 , @xmath68 and the transverse ones @xmath69 , where plus ( minus ) are for @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "the energy conservation , @xmath72 can be simplified using the fact that the dispersive correction is small in the range which we are interested , @xmath73 realizing that the transverse momentum is proportional to this , and thus that it is also small , one may simplify energy conservation further .",

    "numerical simulations , starting from a variety of out - of - equilibrium distributions , have been shown to approach this spectrum rather rapidly ( again , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , the sign of the flux associated with this cascade is such that it develops in uv direction , making it irrelevant for problem under consideration .",
    "note that the total energy density contained in the sounds , @xmath80 is convergent at the uv end .",
    "now we discuss an alternative case , when the dispersive correction coefficient in ( [ dispersion ] ) is negative , @xmath81 , and , therefore , the binary on - shell decays of sound waves are forbidden . in this case",
    "one should consider the second order processes , i.e. the scattering @xmath82 , as well as three - body decays @xmath83 and corresponding inverse processes ( which are always permitted by the conservation laws ) .    for a relativistic scalar theory with triple @xmath84 and quartic @xmath85 interactions , these processes stem either from nonlocal diagrams @xmath86 or from local ones @xmath87 .",
    "when only the latter are present , derivation of the kinetic equation for weak turbulence is very straightforward ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . yet",
    "the former diagrams , @xmath86 , when present , are dominant , since @xmath88-channel exchanges lead to the small - angle and large impact parameter collisions with large cross sections .",
    "this is known for gluons and is also the case for sound waves .",
    "the four - wave scattering amplitude , the boltzmann equation itself and its stationary solution are more complicated , and we will not repeat here the material covered in the ref .",
    "let us only briefly mention the ideas essential for the understanding of the weak turbulence .",
    "the @xmath82 scattering amplitude is , schematically , a sum of the type @xmath89 where @xmath90 are four participating particles .",
    "for small angles @xmath91 relative to the momentum @xmath2 ( the external argument of boltzmann equation ) , the denominators are @xmath92 the scattering amplitude is substituted into the collision integral of the boltzmann equation , which is then solved by means of the scaling analysis .",
    "the difficulty is that the first term in ( [ denominator ] ) scales as the first power of momentum , while the energy corrections have a different scaling index , @xmath93 which we assume is @xmath94 .",
    "the issue was resolved by katz and kontorovich , who suggested complementing the scaling transformation of momenta by an additional rotation , such that the angles are rescaled by @xmath95 now all terms in the denominators above have the same index @xmath96 .",
    "this transformation keeps ( parts of ) the collision integral invariant and ultimately leads to an isotropic stationary kolmogorov - like power solution . for the inverse ( particle flow ) cascade , we are interested in the index @xmath97 of the momentum density @xmath98 , which satisfies the constant flux equation , @xmath99 here the index @xmath100 is the index of the triple vertex , @xmath101 .",
    "the first two terms are obvious ",
    "there are three densities and four triple vertices ( since we take a square of the amplitude ) ; the third one comes from the energies in the denominator of ( [ denominator ] ) and the energy conservation condition , the fourth ( fifth ) comes from the longitudinal ( transverse ) momentum conservation condition , and others have to do with the phase space integration measure .",
    "note that one should take special care of the argument of the energy conservation under katz - kontorovich transformation and angular integrations , which produce the last two @xmath96 terms . substituting the space dimension @xmath102 and the index @xmath94 of @xmath103 , one gets @xmath104 ( another power solution of the boltzmann equation  the energy flux solution  has an opposite sign of the flow , to uv , which we thus disregard . )",
    "since the obtained index is in the segment @xmath105 , the energy integral ( [ eqn_energy ] ) is dominated by the uv end and is thus irrelevant , while the particle number @xmath106 @xmath107 dominated by the ir end .",
    "such cascades , driven by particle number normalizations , are usually called the  particle number cascades \" .",
    "this is not the end of the story because growing particle density at small @xmath2 eventually violates the applicability condition of weak turbulence , @xmath108 .",
    "so , at the ir end , the physics is in the regime of strong turbulence , in which consideration of higher order diagrams is required . to our knowledge",
    ", this question was never considered in the case of sounds .",
    "the strong turbulence regime was studied in the case of relativistic @xmath109 theory by berges and collaborators @xcite , who derived a renormalized inverse cascade , with modified indices .",
    "importantly , those were confirmed by direct simulations , in @xmath102 and @xmath110 spatial dimensions @xcite .",
    "the core of their theory is that the rescattering diagrams can be included in a rather elegant way , via a renormalized effective self - interaction coupling , @xmath111 at small @xmath2 , @xmath112 , so we can neglect 1 in the expression above . therefore , its scaling index @xmath113 , defined by @xmath114 enters the boltzmann equation , the expression for the particle flux and the final equation for the index . for the @xmath102 case , it is simply @xmath115 i.e. , the index of the density .",
    "( density appears linearly in @xmath116 ; other factors cancel . ) omitting details , the equation for the index then reads @xmath117 in the weak turbulence regime , @xmath118 , and one should exclude @xmath113 .",
    "the index then is @xmath119 .",
    "however , in the opposite strong turbulence case , one should use ( [ eqn_delta ] ) , and the index is renormalized to another  much larger ",
    "value @xmath120 this was the value which was indeed observed in numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "the case of gluon cascade offers some further suggestions and intuition . while it also has a triple vertex and",
    "is dominated by the small - angle scattering , the impact parameter in this case is dominated by the debye screening length @xmath121 produced by scattering of a virtual gluon on the ambient plasma , and thus depending on the gluon density .",
    "let us now try to apply the same logic for the acoustic turbulence .",
    "the main physics idea is that due to the particle forward scattering on others in the medium , it gains an additional correction to its energy , which we will denote by @xmath122 ( with a prime , to distinguish it from the original @xmath103 ) .",
    "its scaling index is then denoted by @xmath123 . in the strong turbulence regime one",
    "expects the rescattering effect to become dominant , @xmath124 , and hence one should replace @xmath96 by @xmath123 in the index equation .",
    "classical perturbation theory , as described in , e.g. , chapter 1 of @xcite , starts from a hamiltonian of the type @xmath125 including the wave amplitude @xmath77 ( for brevity , we drop momentum indices here and below ) and the triple vertices @xmath126 and @xmath127 . in case of nondecay ,",
    "the triple vertices are irrelevant and can be eliminated by the canonical transformation @xmath128 where @xmath129 are new amplitudes .",
    "the new hamiltonian is then rewritten as @xmath130 where @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "the next step is to use statistical description , eliminating rapidly varying terms and leaving only slowly changing correlation functions such as @xmath133 . the second quartic term in ( [ eqn_hc ] )",
    "gives the @xmath134 scattering amplitude ; its square appears in the corresponding kinetic equation .    for a generic triple vertex @xmath135",
    ", this second term also gives rise to the forward scattering amplitude , fig .",
    "[ diagrams::a ] , which can be reinterpreted as a perturbative correction to the wave energy due to the particle scattering on all others , @xmath136 ( in the spirit of an effective potential for slow neutrons in ordinary or nuclear matter ) .",
    "the kinematics of the forward scattering makes two momenta , contributing to the vertex being identical and thus the remaining one being zero .",
    "so , naively , if one of the momenta in @xmath137 vanishes , then the amplitude of the process is zero .",
    "however , the denominator in ( [ treeamplitude ] ) also vanishes and , applying the lhospital s rule with @xmath138 , one can show that the total expression ( the amplitude ) is finite .",
    "we do not evaluate the absolute magnitude of @xmath122 , only its scaling index , @xmath139 here the @xmath140 corresponds to @xmath141 , @xmath97 to the density @xmath142 , and @xmath143 to the scaling of the denominator ; hence @xmath144 in ( [ treeamplitude ] ) , the last term , comes from the integration measure over @xmath145 .",
    "then we substitute this into the index equation ( [ eqn_index ] ) instead of @xmath96 and get a corrected index for the strong turbulence @xmath146 corresponding to a flat sound power spectrum .    here",
    "we calculated the index of the diagram , fig .",
    "[ diagrams::a ] , and not the diagram itself . in case",
    "there is a fine - tuning of the parameters leading to a vanishing contribution of this diagram ( which we can not exclude _ a priori _ ) , one should focus on the third term of ( [ eqn_hc ] ) .",
    "it generates a nonzero forward scattering and correction to the energy of the order @xmath147 , from a scattering on @xmath148 particles [ see fig .  [ diagrams::b ] ] .",
    "the intermediate wave is not collinear with the original one , so in this kinematics @xmath126 and @xmath127 do not vanish .",
    "in this case , the index for @xmath122 will be @xmath149 where , again , the @xmath150 corresponds to @xmath151 , @xmath152 to two densities , and @xmath153 to frequencies in the denominator and in the energy conservation condition , and the last term comes from the angular integral .",
    "we substitute it into the index equation ( [ eqn_index ] ) instead of @xmath96 and obtain an even larger index @xmath154 at this point , since considering all competing mechanisms and diagrams would go beyond the scope of this paper , we just conjecture that 6 is the largest possible index .    in summary , we suggest that the strong acoustic turbulence can be considered similarly to the scalar and gluon ones , with the impact parameters of scattering determined self - consistently , by higher order rescattering processes .",
    "dedicated theoretical studies and numerical simulations are required in order to check if the proposed index ( [ strong ] ) is correct .",
    "if so , or even if it is different but still , say , large enough , @xmath155 , this would enhance @xmath3 and increase the gw intensity by a huge factor .      in the regime",
    "where external sources and sinks are switched off , the power kolmogorov spectra are represented by self - similar propagating solutions of the type @xmath156   =   \\hat { t}^{-q } f_s[\\xi]\\ , ,           \\label{selfsim}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath157 and @xmath158 are dimensionless time and momenta , respectively , normalized to the collision rate at some normalization momentum @xmath159 and @xmath160 . with such normalization ,",

    "a simple self - similar solution perhaps might not be enough if the index @xmath167 , since in this case @xmath168 integrals @xmath169 ( [ eqn_energy ] ) and @xmath166 ( [ eqn_n ] ) will be dominated by the ir scale : conservation of both by a @xmath170 self - similar solution is not possible , so we can not suggest a scenario for the time - dependent solution at this time .",
    "propagation of sound waves , with all sources and sinks switched off , in a strong turbulence regime requires additional studies .",
    "if the overpopulation of the ir scale in scalar and gluonic cascades leads to the formation of a condensate , it would also be interesting to study the latest stages of the sound turbulence , which may ( hypothetically ) evolve into a finite number of very loud long - wave sound waves .    .",
    "the grey upper curves are for sounds , from bottom to top as time progresses , @xmath171 .",
    "the black curves in the bottom are for rotational excitations.,width=302 ]    let us return to the discussion of the initial sound generation , with another look at the results of the numerical simulations done in ref .",
    "figure  [ fig_hindmarsh ] , reproduced here from this work , shows the spectrum of the fluid velocity squared over the log of momentum , @xmath172 .",
    "the first important statement stemming from these spectra is that the hydrodynamic perturbations are dominated by the sound modes ( grey curves above ) , while the rotational ones ( solid curves below ) are suppressed by several orders of magnitude .",
    "it is not known how universal this feature is , but let us accept it for now .",
    "the spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig_hindmarsh ] have a shallow maximum at @xmath173 corresponding to a characteristic dynamical scale of the simulation , the distance between bubbles .",
    "should this calculation be extended to smaller @xmath2 , we think it is inevitable that the spectrum will be exponentially cut off in the ir .",
    "spectra at subsequent time moments show no visible tendency of movement of the maximum .",
    "we attribute this to the fact that the total time of the simulation is simply not enough time for the sound cascade  and self - similar solution  to develop .",
    "note that the typical magnitude of @xmath174 in this simulation is @xmath175 ( in relativistic units , with the speed of light @xmath176 ) .",
    "results of these simulations provide , in principle , the initial sound power spectrum , from which the inverse acoustic cascade may start evolving . since we expect it to start as weak turbulence in a self - similar form ( [ selfsim ] ) , we only need to know the conserved @xmath166 .",
    "the energy of the sound waves , to the second order , is the unperturbed density of matter times the fluid velocity squared @xmath177 .",
    "so one can relate this spectrum to the sound wave occupation numbers via @xmath178 the approximately flat observed left - hand side shows that the effective initial value of the index is close to 4 ( of course , only in a limited range of scales and time ) .",
    "then it is supposed to become the weak turbulence , and the slope for the curve would be @xmath179 , while the left end of the curve , in the lower @xmath2 region , enters the strong turbulence regime with the slope @xmath180 , i.e. , stays flat .",
    "if @xmath181 , or even 2 as we included as a possibility , the energy spectrum will start growing toward small @xmath2 .",
    "general expressions for the gw production rate are well known , and we will not reproduce them here , proceeding directly to the main object , the two - point _ correlator of the stress tensors _ , @xmath182 note that while the big bang is homogeneous in space , the 3-momentum can be well defined and conserved , but it is time dependent .",
    "we will , however , still treat it as quasistatic , with well - defined frequencies of perturbations , with a cutoff at the lowest end , @xmath183 .",
    "using hydrodynamical expression for the stress tensor , @xmath184 and expanding it in powers of a small parameter  the sound amplitude ",
    "one can identify terms related to the sound wave . associating the zeroth order terms with the matter rest frame ,",
    "one introduces the first order velocities by @xmath185 and one expands the stress tensor to the second order as @xmath186 the correlator is to be coupled to the metric perturbations @xmath187 and we are interested in indices corresponding to two polarizations of the gw transverse to its momentum @xmath188 .",
    "such components are only provided by the term with velocities , and thus we focus on @xmath189 where we dropped the overall factor @xmath190 and subscripts `` @xmath191 '' for the first order terms .    the next step is to split four velocities into two pairs , for which we use the  sound propagators \" , @xmath192 where we changed indices to the latin ones , emphasizing that those are only spatial . in these terms , the correlator in question is a loop diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_sketch](b ) .",
    "similar loop diagrams were derived and discussed in connection with fluctuation - induced or loop corrections to hydrodynamical observables : for a recent review of the results , standard definitions and relations , see @xcite .",
    "time - dependent green s functions can be chosen differently depending on the assumed boundary conditions on the time dependence .",
    "the most natural green s functions for the sounds are the retarded one @xmath193 , which only has poles in a half of the complex energy @xmath194 plane , corresponding to the sound dissipation , and the symmetric one @xmath195 , which has all four possible poles . in equilibrium",
    ", they are related to each other by the so - called kubo - martin - schwinger ( kms ) relation ( @xmath194 ) , @xmath196 where @xmath197 is the equilibrium bose distribution .",
    "this expression shows that @xmath198 corresponds to a single phonon quantum , and the @xmath195 to a wave with proper occupation numbers .",
    "it also suggests generalization to an out - of - equilibrium case that we will use , i.e. , introduction of the new rescaled function @xmath199 containing out - of - equilibrium occupation number @xmath200 , which is assumed to be much larger than the quantum term 1 in ( [ kms ] ) , which is therefore dropped . the explicit expression to be used takes the form @xmath201 where notations are three - dimensional , e.g. @xmath202 .",
    "the dissipation lifetime parameter is related to the shear viscosity @xmath203 now one can perform the fourier transformation and represent the correlator as a standard field theory loop diagram . the imaginary part of the correlator , as usual , corresponds to the unitarity cut of the loop into product of two complex conjugated parts , or the probability of the corresponding sound merging process , @xmath204 multiplied by the newton coupling constant and taken on shell , @xmath205 , this will give us the rate of the @xmath206 + @xmath206 @xmath207 gw process .",
    "note that the unitarity cut also puts both sound lines on shell .",
    "one sound wave obviously can not produce a gw , for the following reasons : ( i ) the dispersion relation for the sound is @xmath208 , which is different from that of the gw , @xmath209 ; ( ii ) polarization of the sound wave is a longitudinal vector , while it should be a transverse tensor for the gw .",
    "two on - shell sound waves can accomplish this . using notations @xmath210 ,",
    "one writes the gw on - shell condition @xmath211 as @xmath212 where @xmath213,@xmath214 are the sound velocity and an angle between the two sound waves , respectively . in terms of such an angle , there are two extreme configurations .",
    "the first is a  symmetric case \" , @xmath215 , corresponding to a minimal angle . for @xmath216 ,",
    "this angle is @xmath217 .",
    "the second , the  asymmetric case \" , corresponds to anticollinear vectors @xmath218 , @xmath219 .",
    "an important difference from the usual textbook relativistic - invariant cases is that various @xmath214 are allowed by kinematics in our case , not only @xmath220 , which is due to the fact that @xmath221 .",
    "since the sources of sounds are of microscopic size , @xmath222 , much smaller than the time @xmath88 of observations , their sound waves have the form of spherical pulses expanding with the speed of sound .",
    "a sketch of the intersection of two such sound spheres is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_sketch ] : it is clear that the angle between the sound momenta runs with time over the region allowed for the gw formation .",
    "however , at least at the momentum range in which sounds are weak and the lowest order process @xmath223 dominates the gw production , one may not think about specific hydrodynamical configurations but simply view it as an incoherent set of plane waves with certain occupation number @xmath3 .",
    "we proceed to the calculation of the  unitarity cut \" of the stress tensor correlator , in which both sound propagators are taken on shell , @xmath224 one can check that the viscous damping is small , @xmath225 , so it only needs to go around a pole on the real axis in the correct way .",
    "the matrix element is given by a sum over the gw polarizations , @xmath226 where the polarization matrices can be chosen to be @xmath227 in the transverse traceless gauge , for a plane wave propagating along the third coordinate .",
    "alternatively , one can use a more general standard replacement for the sum , @xmath228\\,.\\label{crocodile}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] next , the loop momentum integral is customarily rewritten as @xmath229 , and the integral over the energies is taken first using the poles of the denominator .",
    "the pole residua are the numerator on shell ( [ on_shell ] ) divided by the usual @xmath230 , as for a relativistic particle . eliminating the integral over @xmath231 and three delta functions one",
    "is left with a single delta function expressing conservation of energy in the process , @xmath232\\,,\\label{delta}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath233 is an angle between the total ( gw ) momentum @xmath66 and @xmath234 .",
    "so far the steps are similar to a standard calculation of the phase space for particle decays , in which one can go to the c.m .",
    "frame , impose a constraint on momenta from the energy conservation , and reduce the problem to simple angular integrals .",
    "unfortunately , in the problem at hand , we deal with a massless graviton , and we also lack relativistic invariance , which makes this procedure useless .",
    "therefore , all three integrals , @xmath235 , should be done explicitly .",
    "let us first check the integration limits on @xmath236 . from the equations on the energy and momentum conservation , one gets @xmath237 and demanding it to be within the range @xmath238 $ ] , one can constrain the momentum @xmath236 to be between the minimal and maximal values ,    @xmath239    zero of the argument of the delta function ( [ delta ] ) falls into this range , so one can simply replace all @xmath236 by this zero .",
    "after summing over two polarizations of the gw and taking into account occupation numbers @xmath240 for the sounds , the integral can be written as      where the first line contains the jacobian for the delta function and the second line comes from the sound propagators ( [ propagator ] ) and the summation formula ( [ crocodile ] ) .    to make sense of the integral ( [ integral ] ) , which determines the gw generation rate , let us consider three simple cases . if the distribution is flat , @xmath242 , then the integral ( [ integral ] ) is proportional to the volume of the phase space,@xmath243 in the case of thermal equilibrium , @xmath244 , we get a lengthy expression , which can simplified for @xmath245 , @xmath246 finally , for the strong turbulence cases ( [ strong ] ) and ( [ subleading ] ) , the integral is given by @xmath247 respectively .",
    "in this section , we discuss briefly the status of the debates on the order of the qcd phase transition .",
    "qcd with massless quarks has chiral symmetry , but in the real world , finite quark masses make it only an approximate symmetry .",
    "therefore , the transition to the broken phase does not need to be a real phase transition .",
    "we know from lattice gauge theory simulations that pure gauge su(3 ) theory has the first order deconfinement transition . the other extreme ",
    "qcd with three massless quarks  also has the first order transition , now due to the chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "however , for the real qcd , with physical values of @xmath248 quark masses , the lattice results indicate , indeed , a smooth crossover - type transition ( for current status of the problem see @xcite and references therein ) . however , the deconfinement is a more subtle story , with the conclusion being much less obvious . following the  dual superconductor \" ideas of t hooft and mandelstam from the 1980s ,",
    "the nature of confinement is the bose - einstein condensation of certain magnetically charged objects  color monopoles .",
    "del debbio _",
    "proposed an operator inserting a monopole into the vacuum .",
    "this operator has a nonzero vacuum expectation in the confined phase , as shown by the direct lattice simulation @xcite .",
    "the behavior of the monopole bose clusters , which are interchanged along the matsubara circle  also indicates @xcite that these objects undergo bose - einstein condensation at @xmath249 .",
    "thus , confinement indeed possesses certain observable  order parameters \" .",
    "( although in the usual  electric \" formulation of the gauge theory those are nonlocal , they are local in models attempting  magnetic \" formulation . ) admittedly , two of the lattice works just mentioned are for pure gauge theories which have phase transitions , not for qcd - like theories with quarks . the most accurate lattice simulations which focus on thermodynamical observables do show smoothening of the critical behavior by quark masses , and for physical qcd",
    ", one finds only a cross - over transition so far , without any visible singularity .",
    "( for a long time , this was related to the fact that pure gauge theory is @xmath250 symmetric , while theories with fundamental quarks are not .",
    "however , discovery of confinement for gauge theories without center symmetry nullified this argument . )    thus , there is no clear answer to the question of whether the deconfinement transition in physical qcd is a phase transition in the strict sense .",
    "one possible resolution may be a  cryptic \" transition , in which there is a singularity in the order parameter , which in thermodynamical observables , is also present but too weak to be seen with current numerical accuracy .",
    "another option for sound and gw generation is that , while there is no first order transition in qcd , and therefore no mixed phase with macroscopically large bubbles , there may still exist some metastable objects in the near-@xmath6 region with a lifetime large enough to cause out - of - equilibrium phenomena and sound generation .",
    "we recently studied dynamics of qcd strings and found @xcite that certain nonperturbative objects , so - called  string balls \" , can reach rather large mass in metastable states , which under a certain slow cooling , can experience rapid collapse , similar to the gravitational collapse , due to the attractive self - interaction of qcd strings .",
    "such collapse can also generate inhomogeneous energy distribution ,  overcooling \" and subsequent sound generation .",
    "the freeze - out in the little bang happens very close to the qcd phase transition region .",
    "studies of rapidity correlation among secondaries reveal the existence of clustering of secondaries , perhaps local remnants of the qgp phase .",
    "the study of this process leads to the suggestion @xcite  not yet observed  that such qgp clusters should implode at @xmath249 , in what was called ",
    "mini - bangs \" .",
    "such a process may be a very effective mechanism for transferring energy into sounds .",
    "in this paper , we discussed cosmological production of gravity waves from the sound waves , originating in the big bang phase transitions .",
    "while most of studies focus on the electroweak transition , we emphasized the qcd one .",
    "current progress in pulsar timing / correlation technique may help detect cosmological gw even earlier than ew one , for which large gw detectors have to be built in space .    as a function of momentum scale @xmath2 , there should be three distinct stages of the process : ( i ) initial generation of the sound spectrum at the ",
    "uv root \" scale @xmath47 , ( ii ) acoustic turbulent cascade , and ( iii ) conversion of sounds into the gw .",
    "while stage ( i ) is highly nontrivial and requires further study , we argue that the intermediate regime ( ii ) is reasonably well understood theoretically .",
    "the possibility of an inverse acoustic cascade is the main new suggestion of this paper .",
    "if it happens , the momentum density of sound @xmath3 becomes self - focused , from large to small momenta @xmath2 .",
    "since the ratio of the uv and ir scales is as large as 18 orders of magnitude , and the indices ( powers of the ratio ) can be near 4 or larger , the enhancements can by huge .",
    "the possibility of having an inverse acoustic cascade depends on the sign of the sound dispersion curve correction ( [ dispersion ] ) : only the negative sign is suitable .",
    "currently , for neither the qcd nor the ew plasma do we know this sign .",
    "thus , we have two cases and perhaps 50% chances in each : it may happen in one or the other .",
    "if the case with the inverse cascade occurs , its index will be known in the weak turbulence regime .",
    "furthermore , we expect the self - similar time - dependent solution to represent time evolution .",
    "eventually , the inverse acoustic cascade goes into an @xmath3 so large that the evolution goes into the regime of strong turbulence .",
    "we provide an estimate for the index , imitating renormalization in the scalar theory @xcite .",
    "if true , it suggests a large index ( [ strong ] ) and thus potentially very strong enhancement of the sound wave density at small @xmath2 .",
    "it also suggests that a single self - similar time evolution would no longer be possible .",
    "clearly , dedicated studies are needed .",
    "another main result of the paper is the evaluation of the sound - to - gw transition rate .",
    "it is based on the realization that its rate can be calculated using the one - loop sound diagram for the stress - tensor correlator using standard rules .",
    "furthermore , this loop diagram can be cut by unitarity , putting both sound waves on shell .",
    "the only needed additional ingredient remains the occupancy factors : the gw yield is proportional to its square at the appropriate momenta .",
    "a mechanism producing sounds is still not understood .",
    "out - of - equilibrium dynamics of qcd and ew phase transitions remains far from being understood .",
    "we argued above that certain order parameters jump at @xmath6 ; small - latent - heat deconfinement transition of the first order is still perhaps possible : if so , there would be a mixed phase and bubbles , alight with a relatively small contrast in the energy density between the phases .",
    "so far , it has been assumed in the literature that bubble walls must collide to produce the sounds .",
    "however , there is another potential mechanism , well known in hydrodynamical literature , namely , the rayleigh - type collapse of the qgp clusters at @xmath249 @xcite .",
    "one more possibility we mention is a crossover transition , with only microscopic metastable objects ",
    "e.g. , the string balls @xcite  producing the out - of - equilibrium sounds .",
