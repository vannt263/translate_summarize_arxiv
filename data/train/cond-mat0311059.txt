    "bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) loaded into optical lattices show a wide range of interesting physical properties and complex nonlinear dynamics .",
    "optical lattices can be employed to study many important physical phenomena of atomic and solid state physics .",
    "the properties of coherent macroscopic matter waves in a lattice , such as the bloch - band structure  @xcite , macroscopic interference effects  @xcite , bloch oscillations and landau - zener tunnelling  @xcite , have been explored in a number of experiments .",
    "one of the many advantages in using a macroscopic quantum periodic system , such as becs in optical lattices is that the effective periodic potential created by a standing light wave can be easily and precisely manipulated by changing the intensities , polarizations , geometry or frequencies of the interfering laser beams .",
    "for example , the depths of the periodic potential wells induced by an optical lattice can be controlled by tuning the intensities of the laser beams .",
    "the shape of the potential can also be varied by creating an optical superlattice with more than one order of periodicity .",
    "the novel possibilities for band - gap engineering offered by superlattices have been shown to lead to a variety of phase transitions in the contensate @xcite , and can be effectively employed for ultracold atom manipulations , such as patterned loading of atoms into lattice sites  @xcite .",
    "most remarkably , periodicity of the optical lattice potential leads to the effective dispersion of the bec wavepackets being a function of the band structure .",
    "thus by inducing the motion of the lattice relative to the bec ( i.e. via non - zero detuning of the laser beams ) , one can manage the dispersion properties of a matter wave  @xcite .",
    "coherent matter waves are inherently nonlinear due to the presence of interatomic interactions .",
    "one of the common features of nonlinear dispersive systems is the existence of solitons .",
    "_ bright solitons _ are localized wavepackets where the effects of dispersion are balanced by nonlinearity to produce self - trapping . in bose - einstein condensates ,",
    "bright solitons require very special conditions to be observed . without a periodic potential , an attractive nonlinearity and a low number of atoms within each soliton ( to prevent condensate collapse )",
    "is required  @xcite . in an optical lattice , bright matter - wave solitons",
    "have been predicted to exist , due to the balance of repulsive atomic interactions and negative effective dispersion near a band edge  @xcite .",
    "bright solitons of repulsive bec take the form of _ gap solitons _ ,",
    "embedded in the spectral gaps of the linear bloch - wave spectrum .    in the majority of condensates currently created experimentally , the interatomic interaction is repulsive .",
    "this corresponds to an effectively defocusing nonlinearity of the matter - wave which can support _ dark solitons _ - localized dips on the condensate density background with a phase gradient across the localized region .",
    "similar to other types of solitons , they can remain dynamically stable due to the balancing effects of nonlinearity and the ( positive ) dispersion .",
    "dark solitons have been created experimentally in repulsive condensates by using a phase - imprinting technique to apply a sharp phase gradient to a condensate cloud in a magnetic trap  @xcite . in the case of becs loaded into optical lattices , i.e. with the possibility for dispersion management , dark solitons can be supported in both repulsive ( for positive effective dispersion ) and attractive condensates ( for negative effective dispersion ) . moreover ,",
    "dark lattice solitons are expected to be easier to create experimentally than bright gap solitons , as they are not confined to the spectral gaps  @xcite , and a phase - imprinting technique can be applied to a nonlinear bloch - wave background within a spectral band .",
    "alternatively , trains of dark solitons can be created in a periodic potential via bragg scattering @xcite .",
    "the theory of dark solitons has been developed extensively for many types of periodic systems such as discrete atomic chains and waveguide arrays  @xcite . applying the concepts of discrete dynamical systems to the physics of the bose - einstein condensates in optical lattices , abdullaev _ et al . _",
    "@xcite studied dark and bright solitons on non - zero backgrounds in a vertical lattice by employing a discrete mean - field model derived in the tight - binding approximation , i.e. considering a single isolated band of the bloch - wave spectrum .",
    "in contrast , yulin and skryabin  @xcite used a single - gap continuous coupled - mode model in order to examine the stability and existence of out - of - gap dark and bright solitons . a more general analysis based on the continuous gross - pitaevskii equation with a periodic potential",

    "@xcite as well as konotop and salerno  @xcite also found numerically stable dark solitons for periodic quasi - one - dimensional bec systems .",
    "the weak spectral instability of the dark solitons in the combined optical lattice and a strong harmonic potential , both in the discrete and continuous mean - field models , has been established in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the structure and mobility properties of dark solitons in single and double - periodic optical lattices ( superlattices ) by employing the full continuous mean - field model .",
    "first , we describe the multiple band structure of the condensate bloch - wave spectrum and analyze the bloch waves corresponding to the band edges of the matter - wave spectrum of a single - periodic optical lattice .",
    "we then extend this analysis to the case of a double - periodic optical superlattice and demonstrate that extra mini - gaps appear in the matter - wave spectrum .",
    "we show that in - band bloch states can support dark solitons , and find numerically continuous families of dark solitons imprinted onto the nonlinear bloch waves of a repulsive bec .",
    "these localized states display some properties found in discrete lattice models , including the existence of the pinning ( peierls - nabarro ) potential @xcite that inhibits the solitons mobility and interactions even in the shallow - well case .",

    "several analytical techniques have been developed to study stability of dark solitons and are outlined in a review paper by kivshar and luther - davies  @xcite .",
    "however , a rigorous analysis of stability of dark matter - wave solitons in an optical lattice is complicated by the fact that their backgrounds are not constant but take the form of nonlinear bloch waves .",

    "this energy difference corresponds to the maximum of an effective potential of the lattice known as the peierls - nabarro ( pn ) potential  @xcite .",
    "the height of the pn potential can be understood as the minimum energy required to move a localized wavepacket by one lattice site , i.e. the difference between the energies of a soliton located at a minimum of the periodic lattice and one at a maximum . as was shown for bright localized modes in a discrete lattice",
    ", the two different stationary states can be seen to represent a moving mode at different times , therefore the knowledge of the pn potential height is essential in answering the questions about possible mobility of a lattice soliton and its ability to interact with other localized states  @xcite .",
    "analytical and numerical calculations of the pn potential for the bright gap solitons have recently been performed in the discrete gp model @xcite , assuming the tight - binding regime of the bec dynamics .",
    "remarkably , it has been established that the tight binding calculations of the pn potential fail to match the results for the full continuous model even in the regime of parameters where the approximation is well justified . here",
    ", we calculate the pn potential height for the two types of dark solitons found both in the single- and double - periodic lattice , and show the results of the calculations for different values of @xmath46 in fig .",
    "[ pn ] . in a single - periodic lattice [ fig .",
    "[ pn ] ( a ) ] , for the moderate values of @xmath46 within the first band , the dependence has a `` flat '' region followed by a region where the pn barrier for the on - site dark soliton is positive .",

    "clearly , for a fixed chemical potential , lattice height , and periodicity , variation of the superlattice parameter @xmath19 controls the height of the pn potential and therefore mobility and interaction properties of the dark solitons .    to model interactions between dark matter - wave solitons in an optical lattice we integrate eq .",

    "the results of the temporal dynamics are shown in figure  [ figinteractions ] ( for the values of @xmath46 near the bottom edge of the first band ) , and seem to agree with the qualitative predictions from the pn calculations .",
    "figure  [ figinteractions](a ) shows that even in the shallow - well regime , a single- periodic potential is sufficient to trap the dark solitons due to the effect of the large positive pn potential height ( both solitons are initially centered at the potential minima ) . in this case , the density perturbation of the matter wave develops from the numerical noise . by adding the amplitude perturbation to the initial conditions",
