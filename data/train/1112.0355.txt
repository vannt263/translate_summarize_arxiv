    "the emission of galactic black hole binaries ( bhbs ) and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) displays a significant aperiodic variability on a broad range of time - scales .",
    "the power spectral density ( psd ) of such variability is generally modeled with a power law , @xmath4 , where @xmath2 is the power at frequency @xmath5 , and the power - law index @xmath6 keeps a constant in a certain range of @xmath5 , but changes among different ranges . at high frequencies ,",
    "the psds of both bhbs and agn present a steep slope with @xmath7 . on the contrary , below a break frequency , typically at a few hz for bhbs , they flatten to a slope with @xmath8 , representing the flicker noise ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "several models have been proposed in order to understand this nearly featureless character of power spectra .",
    "the so - called  shot noise models \" ( @xcite ) attempted to describe the light curves as a series of independent overlapping shots with specific time - scales , amplitudes , and occurence rates . due to lack of physical picture in this scenario ,",
    "various physically motivated ideas have been put forward subsequently , such as the fluctuations of hydrodynamic or magnetohydrodynamic turbulence ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , magnetic flares or density fluctuation in the corona ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and lyubarskii s general scheme ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in the lyubarskii s scheme , it was noted that any variation of accretion rate , which is caused by small amplitude variations in the viscosity , would induce a variation in the accretion rate at the inner radius of the disc , where most of the energy is released .",
    "moreover , observations showed that the variability is non - linear and the rms variability is proportional to the average flux over a wide range of time - scales ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it indicates that the short time - scale variations are modulated by the longer time - scales , which favors the lyubarskii s scheme .",
    "however , the observed power spectra often deviate from the form @xmath9 .",
    "for example , the psd of cyg x-1 is well described with the form @xmath9 in the soft state , however , exhibits the form @xmath10 in the hard state ( @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , it is shown that the power - law index is around @xmath11 both in the soft state of bhbs and in narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "such a dispersion of the power - law index reveals that there must exist some other mechanism .",
    "a radius - dependent amplitudes of @xmath12 fluctuations may help to alleviate the discrepancy between theories and observations .",
    "however , it remains unclear why the fluctuations of @xmath12 should have a strong radius - dependent form .    in the present paper",
    ", we will take into account another mechanism , outflows , which is a popular phenomenon in accretion systems and has strong observational evidence .",
    "one of the best examples comes from sgr a * , whose center harbors a supermassive black hole surrounded by an accretion flow that is likely to be in the form of the advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf , @xcite ) .",
    "radio polarization observations constrain the accretion rate in the innermost region is nearly two orders of magnitude lower than that measured at the bondi radius ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which indicates that intense outflows may present in this system .",
    "besides , the absorption lines from highly ionized elements , which have been detected in the x - ray spectrum of some microquasars such as gro j1655 - 40 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , grs 1915 + 105 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and atoll sources ( see e.g. the review by @xcite and references therein ) , also indicate the existence of outflows . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite found that outflows generally exist in accretion discs no matter that the flow is advection - dominated such as the slim disc ( @xcite ) and the adaf , or is radiation - dominated such as the standard thin disc ( @xcite ) . in particular , for the three types of advection - dominated flows : adafs ( gas internal energy dominant ) , slim discs ( trapped photon energy dominant ) , and hyper - accretion discs ( trapped neutrino energy dominant ) , outflows may be significantly strong due to positive bernoulli parameters ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) or the large radiation pressure ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , outflows have generally been found in many simulation works ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .    in the lyubarskii s scheme ,",
    "the power spectrum of luminosity fluctuations is sensitive to the varying mass accretion rate , thus we expect that outflows may have significant effects on the power - law index .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we investigate the fluctuation power spectrum under a radius - dependent accretion rate following the method of lyubarskii .",
    "the potential application of our results to observations is discussed in section 3 .",
    "in the present work , following the lyubarskii s general scheme , we revisit the power spectral density of luminosity fluctuations by considering a radius - dependent accretion rate .",
    "the relevant processes are the conservation of mass and angular momentum . with a radius - dependent accretion rate ,",
    "these two processes are described as follows : @xmath13 @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the surface density , accretion rate , angular velocity and @xmath19 component of the stress tensor at the radius @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "@xmath21 is the change of accretion rate over @xmath20 in the stationary accretion state , i.e. @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the angular momentum of @xmath24 .    with @xmath25 ,",
    "@xmath26 at the inner radius @xmath27 , we can obtain @xmath28 \\\\ & = & \\frac{\\dot { m}{\\omega}r^2}{2\\pi}[1 - ( \\dot { m}_{\\rm in } l_{\\rm in}+\\int_{r_{\\rm in } } ^r { { \\phi } l_{\\phi } dr})/(\\dot { m}{\\omega}r^2)].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the following definitions : @xmath29 @xmath30 the above description of @xmath31 can be simplified as @xmath32 for standard thin discs and adafs , @xmath33 , and thus @xmath34 .",
    "we assume @xmath35 in this paper , where @xmath36 is a constant .",
    "if the accretion rate has weak dependence on the radius and @xmath37 , the value of @xmath38 would remain nearly constant . in order to simplify the problem , we assume @xmath38 to be constant in our analysis .",
    "the validity of this assumption is discussed in appendix  a.    with @xmath39 , equation ( [ angular_conservation ] ) becomes @xmath40 } { \\partial h } .\\ ] ] substituting the above equation into the equation ( 1 ) , we have @xmath41 the relationship between @xmath42 and @xmath31 can be deduced with @xmath43-prescription and the local balance between the heating and the cooling in the disc .",
    "the formula is similar to that with a constant accretion rate ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , i.e. @xmath44 where the exponents @xmath45 and @xmath46 are determined by the disc model , which are discussed in  2.2 , and @xmath47 is a function of @xmath12 .",
    "it should be noted that the analysis presented here is not strict for adafs . a stringent analysis for the adafs may refer to appendix  b.    substituting equation ( [ relationship04 ] ) into equation ( [ perturbation03 ] ) , we have @xmath48 + \\frac{f}{(1 - m)d}\\frac{\\partial d}{\\partial t}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by assuming @xmath49 $ ] , where @xmath50 is de - correlated at different radial scales and its correlation time - scale is of the order of the local viscous time - scale , the disturbed quantities @xmath47 and @xmath31 are @xmath51 where @xmath52 is defined as @xmath53 and the subscript @xmath54 denotes unperturbed quantities .",
    "substituting the above equations into equation ( [ initialp02 ] ) , and including the following stationary condition @xmath55 we have , @xmath56 here , we assume that the coupling between the local outflow and inflow is weak on the accretion rate fluctuations . a simple discussion on this issue is presented in  2.4 .      assuming the radius - dependent accretion rate is @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the accretion rate at the inner radius @xmath59 , we have @xmath60 @xmath61\\ ] ] and @xmath62 .",
    "this is a linear diffusion equation with a radius - dependent accretion rate . for @xmath63 ,",
    "i.e. a constant accretion rate in the system , we have @xmath64 and equation ( [ perturbation06 ] ) is reduced to @xmath65 which is the exact form of equation  ( 9 ) in @xcite .    in general ,",
    "the solution of equation ( [ perturbation06 ] ) is ( @xcite , @xcite ) @xmath66i_l [ \\frac{\\kappa ^2xx_1 } { 2(t -   t')}]\\frac{\\partial } { \\partial t'}[\\overline{\\beta } ( t',x_1 ) { \\frac{x_1^{4ls}}{(b^2gmr_{\\rm in})^{s}}}],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 @xmath68 from equation ( 2 ) , the accretion rate @xmath69 is @xmath70 @xmath71 } } dt'dx_1,\\ ] ] where @xmath72 \\\\ \\{x_1 i_{l - 1 }   [ \\frac{\\kappa ^2xx_1 } { 2(t - t ' ) } ] - xi_l [ \\frac{\\kappa ^2xx_1 } { 2(t -   t')}]\\ } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath73 is the bessel function of the imaginary argument .",
    "based on the above equation , the power spectrum of @xmath69 can be obtained following a complex calculation as presented in section 4 of @xcite . here , we directly present the result of the power spectrum and focus on the effects of outflows on the luminosity fluctuations . if @xmath74 , the power spectrum @xmath2 of @xmath69 is @xmath75},\\ ] ] which indicates the power - law index @xmath76 . in this work",
    "we ignore @xmath12 fluctuations , i.e. @xmath77 , and then the expression of @xmath78 will be reduced to @xmath79    for an advection - dominated flow , we have @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 ( @xcite ) for equation ( 7 ) , thus equation ( 13 ) indicates @xmath83 and therefore @xmath78 can be simplified as @xmath84 we would like to stress that the above formula should be valid for all the three types of advection - dominated flows mentioned in the first section .    for a standard thin disc , it is well - known that there exist three regions according to different dominant mechanisms for opacity and pressure .",
    "we have @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 for the outer region ( @xmath88 , @xmath89 ) , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath87 for the middle region ( @xmath88 , @xmath92 ) , and @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 for the inner region ( @xmath96 , @xmath92 ) , thus we easily obtain the following from equations ( 13 ) and ( 15 ) : @xmath97 for the outer region , @xmath98 for the middle region , and @xmath99 for the inner region .",
    "we would point out that outflows may be negligible in standard thin discs expect for the inner region , which is radiation pressure dominated and may suffer the thermal instability .",
    "outflows in the inner region may be significantly stronger than that in the other two regions due to the thermal instability .",
    "however , it remains under controversy whether the inner region is indeed thermally unstable or not ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and many mechanisms have recently been proposed to suppress the instability ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    apart from the above mentioned photon - radiation - dominated flows , neutrino - dominated accretion flows ( ndafs ) have also been widely studied ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , which may account for the central engine of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the outer region of ndafs may be advection - dominated since neutrino cooling can not balance the viscous heating due to low temperature and density .",
    "this region can be regarded as an extension of slim discs ( e.g. , @xcite ) . on the other hand , for high mass accretion rates such as @xmath100 s@xmath101",
    ", the inner region may also become advection dominant due to the large optical depth for neutrinos ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "outflows may occur in ndafs in particular for these two advection - dominated regions owing to positive bernoulli parameters ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    for ndafs , with the balance between the cooling rate by pair capture and the energy dissipation rate per unit volume ( @xcite , eqs .",
    "5.4 - 5.5 ) , we have @xmath80 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 , thus equations ( 13 ) and ( 15 ) directly give the form of @xmath78 : @xmath104    the relationship between @xmath78 and @xmath3 for all the mentioned accretion models are presented in figure  [ fig1 ] , where the short dashed , solid , and long dashed lines correspond to the inner region of standard thin discs , adafs , and ndafs , respectively .",
    "the region with cross symbols represents photon - cooled discs ( cooling dominated either by photon radiation or by advection of photon or gas energy ) , whereas the region with dot symbols represents neutrino - cooled discs ( cooling dominated either by neutrino radiation or by advection of neutrino energy ) .",
    "the figure clearly indicates that , for comparable @xmath3 , a neutrino - cooled disc generally has a larger @xmath78 than a photon - cooled disc .",
    "in other words , @xmath78 in a grb system is generally larger than that in a bhb system .",
    "with @xmath3 for three types of accretion models : radiation - pressure - supported standard thin discs ( the short dashed line ) , adafs ( the solid line ) , and ndafs ( the long dashed line ) .",
    "the region of photon - cooled discs and that of neutrino - cooled discs are marked by the cross symbol and the dot symbol , respectively .",
    "[ fig1],title=\"fig:\",width=288,height=259 ]      the dependence of @xmath78 on @xmath3 can be well understood with equations ( [ accretionr01 ] ) and ( [ lyubarskii ] ) .",
    "following these two equations , the amplitude of @xmath105 , which is the accretion rate variation produced at a radius @xmath20 , is proportional to the accretion rate at that radius , i.e. , @xmath106 .",
    "since variations of the accretion rate in the inner region may be represented as a sum of independent accretion rate variations produced at different radii ( @xcite ) , the power spectrum for the flow with @xmath107 can be written as @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the accretion rate at the radius @xmath20 which contributes to the fluctuation at the frequency @xmath5 , and the term @xmath9 is taken from @xcite for the constant accretion rate case .",
    "taking adafs as an example , we have @xmath110 and @xmath111 , i.e. , @xmath112 . equation ( [ 21 ] ) is therefore simplified as @xmath113 which is exactly the same form as equation ( 16 ) . for other disc models , such as standard thin discs and ndafs ,",
    "the results can be understood in the same way .      as mentioned in  2.1 ,",
    "our results are based on the assumption that the coupling between the local outflow and inflow is weak on the accretion rate fluctuations , i.e. , the response of outflows to the inflow fluctuations is weak . in principle , the outflow should have fluctuations related to the variations of the local inflow accretion rate",
    ". however , the mechanism for outflows may be complicated , and therefore the fluctuations of the outflow may not be determined simply by that of the local inflow .",
    "for example , radiation from the inner region of a disc can heat up the materials in the outer region and thus outflows can be produced ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . in such case the outflow may be more relevant to the inner disc rather than the outer region where it occurs .    here , we make a simple discussion on the possible influence of the local outflow - inflow coupling as follows .",
    "if the coupling exists , the amplitude of accretion rate fluctuation may vary while it propagates into the inner region . with the assumption that @xmath114 is the accretion rate variation at the radius @xmath115 induced by @xmath105",
    ", we introduce a factor @xmath116 to generally describe the change of the above amplitude owing to the coupling effects , i.e. , @xmath117 .",
    "it is easy to find the form of @xmath116 in the following two situations : [ 1 ] , if the coupling is negligible , the amplitude of @xmath105 will keep unchanged during its propagation , i.e. , @xmath118 , thus @xmath119 ; [ 2 ] , if the local outflow is in strong coupling with the local inflow , the relative amplitude @xmath120 will keep unchanged for varying @xmath121 , i.e. , @xmath122 .",
    "obviously , our results are under the former situation . on the contrary , for the latter one",
    ", the power spectrum of accretion rate variations at the inner radius @xmath59 can be expressed as @xmath123 which is the same form as the result with a constant accretion rate .",
    "( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the detailed prescription of @xmath116 is , however , beyond the scope of the present work due to the complexity of outflows .",
    "nevertheless , we can expect that a real flow may exist between situations [ 1 ] and [ 2 ] , and therefore the value of @xmath78 may be located between unity and the results presented in  2.2 .",
    "in this paper , we evaluate the effects of outflows on the luminosity fluctuations with the lyubarskii s general scheme . with a radius - dependent accretion rate @xmath0 , the power spectrum of the luminosity fluctuations is @xmath4 , where the value of @xmath78 varies with the disc structure . by assuming that the coupling between the local outflow and inflow is weak on the accretion rate fluctuations , we obtain the following explicit expressions of @xmath78 for different disc models : @xmath124 for advection - dominated discs , @xmath125 for the outer region of standard thin discs , @xmath126 for the middle region , @xmath127 for the inner region , and @xmath128 for ndafs .",
    "the above expressions imply that @xmath78 in a grb is generally larger than that in a bhb for comparable @xmath3 .",
    "the expressions of @xmath78 indicate the possibility of evaluating the strength of outflows by the power spectrum in x - ray binaries and grbs .",
    "in addition , if the coupling is not negligible , the value of @xmath78 will probably be located between unity and the value presented in the above expressions .    in both bhbs and agn",
    ", adafs are usually adopted to describe the quiescent state , the low / hard state , and the corona which lies above a cold disc .",
    "adafs may produce significant outflows , and therefore the power spectrum can deviate from @xmath9 based on the present analysis .",
    "the exact value of @xmath129 is , however , difficult to estimate from the theoretical point of view , except for the general constraint @xmath130 ( @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "some observations indicate @xmath131 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . taking this value",
    ", we obtain @xmath132 for adafs , which is close to @xmath133 , the power - law index of psds presented in the low mass x - ray binary systems ( @xcite )",
    ". the quantitative difference may be relevant to the coupling between the outflow and inflow as discussed in  2.4 .",
    "if there is only outflow that operates in the accreting system , @xmath3 should be positive .",
    "however , @xmath3 can also be negative due to the evaporation mechanism of a cold disc .",
    "for the accreting black hole in bhbs , the observed power - law components in the x - ray spectra are generally attributed to hot , tenuous plasmas , namely accretion disc coronae . due to the high temperature in the corona",
    ", the interaction between the disc and corona would lead to mass evaporating from the disc to the corona ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in this case",
    ", the value of @xmath3 for the corona should be negative if outflows are not strong , and therefore it is quite possible for @xmath78 to be less than unity .",
    "consequently , in this scenario @xmath3 for the underneath cold disc should be positive .",
