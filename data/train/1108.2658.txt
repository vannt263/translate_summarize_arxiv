    "it was observed that for blackbody radiation@xcite the mean energy @xmath0 of stationary electromagnetic waves is a function of frequency @xmath1 of these waves : at temperature @xmath2 we can write @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "this contradicts the energy equipartition law of classical statistical mechanics in that @xmath0 is frequency independent .",
    "the important contribution of planck came when he discovered that one could obtain the experimental result of eq .",
    "( 1 ) by treating the energy of the stationary electromagnetic waves as a discrete spectra .",
    "planck s law opened the way for quantum mechanics .",
    "in such a way , einstein @xcite gave an important contribution by noticing that in the canonical ensemble the fluctuation of energy of the blackbody radiation is compatible with planck s law when it is , in terms of its variance @xmath5 , expressed in terms of the mean energy @xmath0 through the relations @xmath6 and @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 ( @xmath10 is planck s constant ) and @xmath11 is the number of quantum particles .",
    "einstein imagined the first relation as being exactly a type of general thermodynamic relation , while the second must have a dynamical character , being , in principle , deducible from a microscopic dynamics .",
    "recently , carati and galgani @xcite have investigated classical systems of coupled harmonic oscillators with the procedure of jeans - landau - teller dynamic of molecular collisions @xcite .",
    "the principal results of carati - galgani are that : i ) relaxation times to equilibrium are nonuniform and depend on the internal degrees of freedom of the considered system ; ii ) situations of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics very far from equilibrium are described , in a first order approximation , by the analogous relations found in quantum equilibrium statistical mechanics ; iii ) as conjectured by einstein , eq .",
    "( [ ein2 ] ) is a consequence of the dynamics .",
    "it is important to remark that planck s law considers a real equilibrium state of the quantum statistical mechanics , while within the framework of carati - galgani , a similar relation to planck s law was obtained using nonequilibrium classical statistical mechanics .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to study classical systems of coupled harmonic oscillators along the line of carati - galgani .",
    "we studied three different aspects of this framework .",
    "first , we analyzed the consequence for einstein s conjecture by assuming that the exchanges of energy , in molecular collisions , follows the lvy type statistic for high enough frequencies .",
    "the lvy statistics for the energy exchanges was recently obtained by carati et al .",
    "@xcite , considering the dynamics over a finite time in the jeans - landau - teller model . secondly ,",
    "admitting that there are analogous relations in the equilibrium quantum statistical mechanics of the relations found here using the nonequilibrium classical statistical mechanics approach , we will explore some possible consequences in quantum radiation theory .",
    "third , we show that the generalization of planck s law @xcite within the framework of the recently introduced superstatistic formalism @xcite is compatible with the our analysis of einstein s conjecture .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows .",
    "the carati - galgani model is briefly explained in sec .",
    "our generalization is presented in sec .",
    "discussions about the consequences of our results are presented in sec .",
    "iv . concluding remarks are given in sec .",
    "a good level of interest has been focused on the problem of estimate energy exchanges between vibrational and translational degrees of freedom in the dynamic of molecular collisions .",
    "one of the simplest and main model used to study this problem was published by carati and galgani @xcite .",
    "it is based on the jeans - landau - teller approach @xcite .",
    "a possible example of a physical system that reproduce this formalism follows .",
    "let us imagine a one - dimensional system involving two particles @xmath12 and @xmath13 in a line .",
    "@xmath12 is attracted by a linear spring to the fixed origin through a harmonic oscillator potential . @xmath13",
    "interacts with @xmath12 through an analytical potential . in a first approximation , the variation of energy @xmath14 in a simple collision between @xmath12 and @xmath13 for the oscillator @xmath12 of frequency @xmath1",
    "is given by the addition of a drift term and others dependent on the fluctuation of the oscillator s initial phase .",
    "it is easy to show @xcite that after @xmath15 collisions an oscillator has energy @xmath16 @xmath17 is the oscillator s initial energy that is considered to be very small in order that the motion of @xmath12 and @xmath13 be decoupled .",
    "@xmath18 is the phase of the oscillator in the @xmath19th collision and @xmath20 is evaluated as a function of @xmath1 , which is known to be decreasing exponentially with @xmath1 ( for an analysis of @xmath20 see @xcite ) .",
    "let us consider a assembly of oscillators , averaging over the phases @xmath18 , in order that @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the phase average .",
    "considering the phases to be independent and uniformly distributed , for large @xmath15 , the average of energy and the variance are , respectively , given by @xmath23 and @xmath24 here @xmath25 and @xmath26 correspond to , respectively , the variance and mean of the exchanged energy @xmath27 .",
    "observe that the functional form of the variance is independent of @xmath15 and @xmath20 .",
    "assuming @xmath11 independent identical oscillators and considering the total energy @xmath28 , we immediately obtain for the variance @xmath29 and mean @xmath30 of the exchanged energy @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the initial action per oscillator @xcite .",
    "this result represents essentially the application of the central limit theorem , that arise from a large number of independent contributions of the oscillators @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ carat ] ) is analogous to einstein s relation obtained in the bose - einstein quantum statistical mechanics theory .",
    "despite the fact that this relation has been obtained considering the classical statistical mechanics very far from equilibrium , the approach recovers einstein s conjecture , i.e. , proving it to be a consequence of the dynamics .",
    "recently , carati et al .",
    "@xcite showed that there are systems which present qualitative differences between the statistics obtained using the equilibrium distribution and that obtained through the dynamics over a finite time .",
    "considering the dynamics over a finite time of the jeans - landau - teller model , they obtained that the exchanges of energy follow the lvy type statistics for high enough frequencies .",
    "an immediate consequence of this result , based on the lvy flight random walk @xcite , is that @xmath33 is infinite .",
    "we notice that in the carati - galgani model it is assumed that the oscillators have low energies and the collisions are separated from each other so that the oscillator phases are completely independent . here",
    ", we must be able to answer what happens if the @xmath33 is not finite ? in this way , we can no longer write eq .",
    "( [ cara0 ] ) and , as consequence , eq . ( [ carat ] ) is not valid either .",
    "it is well known that for @xmath34 the theoretical basis is the lindeberg - lvy central limit theorem @xcite .",
    "since we are considering the case of low energies for the oscillators , using the same steps as were used to obtain eq .",
    "( [ cara0 ] ) , it is straightforwardly verified that @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a constant that has dimension of energy and is suitably chosen by dimensional requirements .    finally , for @xmath11 independent identical oscillators",
    ", we find @xmath37 which generalizes the dynamic proposal of einstein and will be our hypothesis to get the generalizations of einstein s conjecture and planck s law .",
    "let us now explore the possibility of there existing analogous relations in the equilibrium quantum statistical mechanics of the relations found here using the nonequilibrium classical statistical mechanics approach .",
    "we start the process using eq .",
    "( [ ein1 ] ) in conformity to einstein s vision . in this case , using eq .",

    "for @xmath48 , @xmath49 coincides with planck s constant @xmath10 , and the @xmath0 associated with bose - einstein quantum statistic is reobtained .    in the same way as the planck blackbody radiation has its origin in the bose - einstein statistics , here obtained using @xmath48 , we can take other values of @xmath50 , so that we can obtain new physical systems such that eq .",

    "in fact , one of the characteristics of eq .",
    "( [ pld ] ) is that it reproduces the results of souza and tsallis @xcite .",

    "our formalism describes the souza - tsallis generalization from the einstein s dynamical fluctuation viewpoint .",

    "the spectrum is made of equidistant levels , like that of the quantum harmonic oscillator , with a constant energy difference between successive levels equal to @xmath81 .",
    "summarizing , we introduced a generalization of einstein s conjecture considering an approach along the line of the carati - galgani model of molecular collisions .",
    "we obtained planck s distribution compatible with the beck - cohen superstatistics .",
    "furthermore , establishing a metaequilibrium very far from equilibrium for the system studied , and admitting that there are analogous relations in the equilibrium quantum mechanics , we generalized planck s law .",
