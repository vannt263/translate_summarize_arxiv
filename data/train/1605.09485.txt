    "many of the the proposed technological applications of graphene rely on the possibility of opening gaps at the dirac points in its band structure @xcite .",
    "such gaps would also allow the experimental study of remarkable exotic physical effects that have been predicted by theory @xcite .",
    "the interest in this system increases greatly if in addition to the band gap , the resulting band structure supports non - trivial topology @xcite . because of the high mobility of its carriers , graphene potentially could be an ideal system for studying electronic properties of a system with momentum - space berry s curvature @xcite .",
    "different strategies have been proposed to endow graphene with topological character .",
    "one approach involves the commensurate stacking of graphene on hexagonal boron nitride @xcite .",
    "another strategy is to induce spin - orbit coupling in the system and thereby open gaps in the spectrum . along these lines",
    ", it has been proposed that a combination of an exchange field and rashba spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) will open such gaps at the dirac points in monolayer @xcite and bilayer @xcite graphene .",
    "this gapped phase is a realization of the quantum anomalous hall ( qah ) insulator in graphene , with a non - vanishing chern number and accompanying gapless edge states @xcite .",
    "the two ingredients for the qah phase can be provided by fe adatoms @xcite or by adsorption of randomly distributed heavy adatoms in the presence of a proximity - induced exchange field @xcite .",
    "coupling between graphene and an antiferromagentic insulator also could induce the anomalous quantum hall phase @xcite .    in this work",
    "we discuss the effects of a unidirectional superlattice zeeman field on the electronic and topological properties of graphene .",
    "this could be induced by spin - exchange with an appropriate substrate , an external magnetic field , or some combination of the two .",
    "when spin is a good quantum number , this is equivalent for each spin species to a unidirectional periodic electrostatic potential , which can induce new dirac points in graphene @xcite . in what follows",
    "we investigate how this behavior is modified by rashba spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , quantified by an energy scale @xmath5 .",
    "our analysis , which works in the continuum limit and ignores intervalley scattering , yields results which are essentially the same for states near the @xmath0 and @xmath1 points , so we will explicitly discuss results for the first of these . we have checked with microscopic tight - binding calculations the accuracy of this approximation .    in the absence of soc , if the exchange potential induces an effective zeeman field purely in the @xmath6 direction , @xmath7 , for each spin there is an effective periodic potential , which throughout this paper we assume varies in the @xmath8 direction .",
    "we mostly focus on situations in which the net exchange field , @xmath9 . for weak and/or short wavelength potentials ,",
    "the main effect of this is to render the dispersion around the dirac points associated with each spin anisotropic @xcite .",
    "we find that soc splits these spin degenerate dirac cones , pushing their zero energy points away from the @xmath0 point , onto the @xmath10 axis . for stronger or longer wavelength @xmath7 , at zero rashba soc ,",
    "new dirac points are already present on the @xmath10 axis @xcite .",
    "we find that with increasing @xmath5 these higher order dirac points become gapped , except for narrow ranges of @xmath5 where the different species of dirac points may be made to approach one another .",
    "for most values of @xmath5 , however , only two dirac points remain , residing symmetrically along the @xmath10 axis on either side of the @xmath0 point . in these situations ,",
    "an application of a uniform zeeman field , or an imbalance in the positive and negative regions of @xmath11 induces gaps in these last two dirac points , and the band becomes topological , supporting an qah effect .",
    "we also consider the effects of in - plane zeeman fields @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "these can arise if an in - plane magnetic field is applied in addition to exchange coupling to a magnetized system .",
    "they can also be present if the magnetized substrate contains a one - dimensional array of oppositely oriented domains .",
    "regions between these regions are domain walls , and these generically contain in - plane fields in the @xmath14 direction ( bloch walls ) or @xmath15 direction ( nel walls )",
    ". we shall see that the effect on the energy level structure depends on which of these two cases is realized , and also on whether neighboring domain walls are aligned or anti - aligned . in some cases there is no qualitative effect on the energy dispersion , in others the dirac points may by moved into the @xmath16 plane , and in still others they may reside on the @xmath17 axis along the superlattice direction rather than perpendicular to it .",
    "an interesting aspect of in - plane zeeman fields induced by domain walls is that the locations of their zero energy states reflect the closed loop an electron spin traces on the bloch sphere when it traverses a single period of the superlattice .    because the carbon atoms are very light , in pristine graphene the soc is extremely small @xcite .",
    "recent studies have shown that rashba soc is enhanced when graphene is bent with respect to its planar geometry @xcite .",
    "a combination of this enhanced soc and a modulated exchange field could allow the realization of configurations presented in this work .",
    "several other approaches could produce a modulation of the effective zeeman field .",
    "the first involves `` origami structures '' @xcite , in which graphene sheets are periodically folded so that the effective magnetic field oscillates in sign as one moves through the graphene layer .",
    "a second possibility is to consider carbon nanotubes in contact with an insulating ferromagnet @xcite . in these cases ,",
    "curvature in the graphene sheet enhances @xmath18 . in a third approach",
    ", one may consider a graphene layer placed in close proximity to a ferromagnet with oppositely oriented magnetic domains alternating along some direction .",
    "finally , an exchange field coupling to the electron spin may be created by depositing hydrogen atoms on the graphene surface @xcite .",
    "this article is generally divided into two parts . in the first we describe our analysis of the system when the exchange field is purely along the @xmath19 direction .",
    "we present a perturbative analysis of the system , as well as tight - binding study results .",
    "finally we present a non - perturbative analysis ( with details in an appendix ) that both confirms the perturbative results , and shows what happens to the higher order dirac points present in the absence of soc . in the second part",
    ", we discuss the effects of additional field components in the @xmath20 plane .",
    "we begin with a perturbative analysis of uniform in - plane fields .",
    "we then present analyses of two models that include domain walls , one using a uniformly rotating exchange field , and the other a piecewise - constant exchange field .",
    "this is followed by a discussion of numerical tight - binding studies .",
    "we finally conclude with a discussion and summary .",
    "we begin by considering models in which the effective zeeman field is always aligned in the @xmath19 direction .",
    "the hamiltonian for such systems consist of three terms , @xmath21 with @xmath22 the kinetic energy , @xmath23 the rashba soc , and @xmath24 is a spin - orienting term . in the absence of soc ,",
    "the conduction and valence bands touch to form dirac points at the @xmath25 and @xmath26 points in the brillouin zone . near these points the low energy physics is described by the hamiltonian @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the fermi velocity of the electrons , @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) for the @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) valley , and @xmath31 is a vector of pauli matrices acting on a spinor specifying the amplitudes of the wavefunction on the @xmath32 and @xmath33 sublattices of graphene .",
    "a second vector of pauli matrices @xmath34 acts on the real spin degree of freedom of an electron , and accompanying both the @xmath35 and @xmath34 matrices are corresponding unit matrices , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "rashba soc appears because of broken mirror symmetry , by interaction with a substrate or induced by heavy adatoms @xcite . in the continuum approximation",
    "the soc rashba term takes the form @xcite , @xmath38 finally we include a unidirectional superlattice effective zeeman field , which contributes to the hamiltonian via @xmath39 for this section we consider an antiperiodic exchange term , i.e. , @xmath40=@xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the period of the zeeman field .",
    "as noted in the introduction , the analytic hamiltonians we consider in this work are continuum approximations which are appropriate when intervalley scattering is negligible . in general this",
    "occurs when the zeeman field varies over length scales which are large compared to the graphene lattice parameter . adopting this assumption ,",
    "in the rest of this paper we will explicitly discuss results only for the @xmath25 valley ( @xmath43 . within this assumption ,",
    "results for the @xmath1 valley are essentially identical .",
    "in what follows we will be mostly interested in the energy spectrum of this system as a function of @xmath17 , the deviation of the momentum from the dirac point .",
    "it is helpful to begin by considering some symmetries of the system .",
    "one of these is a chiral symmetry operation @xcite @xmath44 , consisting of a combined operation of a sublattice chiral operator , @xmath45 , and a shift operator @xmath46 , so that @xmath47 because @xmath44 commutes with the translation operator , it preserves wavevector , so the anticommutation property of @xmath44 with @xmath48 guarantees that for any state at wavevector @xmath49 of energy @xmath50 , there is a corresponding state at the same wavevector with energy @xmath51 .",
    "a second observation is that , because the hamiltonian does not depend on @xmath52 , the momentum in the @xmath52 direction , @xmath10 , is a good quantum number .",
    "writing a wavefunction in the form @xmath53 , the effective hamiltonian acting on @xmath54 becomes @xmath55 , and has the property @xmath56 this implies that for any zero mode of eq .",
    "[ htotal ] appearing at a particular value of @xmath57 , we can construct another zero mode with @xmath58 .",
    "finally , the hamiltonian commutes with a generalized mirror operator @xmath59=@xmath60 , where @xmath61 , and assuming @xmath62 , one may easily show @xmath63=0 $ ] .",
    "moreover , @xmath59 satisfies @xmath64=0 and @xmath65 .",
    "this means that states which are chiral partners ( in general with energies @xmath66 and @xmath67 ) have opposite eigenvalues of the operator @xmath59 .",
    "this allows the system to support dirac points ; i.e. , when @xmath50 approaches 0 as @xmath49 is varied , it is not repelled by its chiral partner with which it becomes degenerate .",
    "the @xmath59 operator can be exploited to help locate zero modes for this system , as we show below .      when the spin - orbit coupling is zero ( @xmath18=0 ) , the hamiltonian consist of two uncoupled blocks with well - defined spin quantum numbers , each of which supports a zero energy dirac point at @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "for small @xmath5 one can obtain the effective hamiltonian in the vicinity of this point using degenerate perturbation theory ; i.e. , by projecting the hamiltonian onto the zero energy basis for @xmath69 .",
    "the four zero energy states have the explicit forms    @xmath70    with @xmath71 multiplying the states in eq . [ basis ] by @xmath72 , the projected hamiltonian ( eq.[htotal ] ) in the resulting basis takes the form @xmath73    with @xmath74 the effective hamiltonian eq . [ heff ] has zero energy solutions .",
    "these zero modes appear at momentum @xmath75 , with @xmath76 one may further expand eq .",
    "[ heff ] around @xmath75 by projecting it onto the two zero mode states at that point . diagonalizing the resulting @xmath77 hamiltonian yields the dispersion law @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the momentum measured relatively to the dirac points , eq .",
    "[ newd ] .",
    "the band structure of pristine graphene is well - described by a tight - binding model with hopping @xmath80ev between nearest neighbor atoms on a honeycomb lattice , represented by @xmath81 where @xmath82 creates an electron at site @xmath83 with spin @xmath84 .",
    "rashba soc in this system can be implemented as a spin - dependent hopping between nearest neighbors of the form @xmath85 where @xmath86 is a unit vector pointing from site @xmath87 to site @xmath83 and @xmath88 is the vector of spin pauli matrices .",
    "finally the zeeman coupling is implemented through a term of the form @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the periodic zeeman field .    for simplicity",
    "we consider here a kronig - penney model zeeman field . writing this in the form",

    "[ bandas](a ) and ( b ) we plot the dependence of @xmath99 on the rashba and exchange field respectively , as obtained from the tight - binding calculation and from eqs .",

    "new dirac points emerge in the spectrum of the decoupled spin hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "the projected hamiltonian ( in the states described by eq .",
    "[ basis ] ) is not sufficient to capture this physics .",
    "not surprisingly , as this regime is approached the predictions of section [ sec : pert_theory ] become inaccurate . below",
    "we discuss the behavior of the higher - order dirac points associated with large @xmath102 when @xmath96 .",
    "some insight about the nature of the soc - split dirac points is obtained by examining wave functions of states near zero energy . in fig . [ wf ]",
    "we plot the absolute square of the wave functions corresponding to the four states marked in the inset of fig .",
    "[ bandas ] .",
    "interestingly , the states are largely localized at the ( two ) interfaces of the unit cell separating regions of opposite signed zeeman fields .",
    "moreover , the direction of the group velocity associated with these states correlates with the sign of the zeeman field steps around which they are located : up - steps and down - steps support states of opposite velocity .",
    "notice that for a given energy there are _ two _ such states at a given interface in the vicinity of the @xmath0 point .",
    "two further states for each interface can be found near the @xmath1 point .",
    "these interface states are similar to those appearing in bilayer graphene in an electrostatic lateral confinement step @xcite , and in periodically modulated bilayer graphene @xcite .",
    "the origin of theses interface states is topological .",
    "graphene in the presence of rashba soc and constant exchange coupling @xmath103 is a quantum anomalous hall system @xcite with hall conductivity @xmath104 where @xmath105=@xmath106 is the chern number associated with the full band , and the factor of 2 enters due to the two dirac points ( valleys ) in graphene .",
    "because of the different chern numbers in each region , at their interface there should appear four parallel velocity edge channels .",
    "for a generic superlattice of such interfaces , their coupling will generally gap out the spectrum ; however , in the presence of an appropriate reflection symmetry ( specifically the @xmath59 operator above ) , for certain choices of @xmath107 there are zero energy states @xcite .",
    "this is the origin of the two dirac points per valley that appear at this superlattice .",
    "( a ) , @xmath108 indicates the velocity of the states along the @xmath15-direction .",
    "@xmath95 is the graphene lattice parameter . ]",
    "the above discussion emphasizes the role of reflection symmetry in the form of the operator @xmath59 in leading to a gapless spectrum .",
    "by contrast if this symmetry is broken one might expect a gap to open @xcite .",
    "moreover , since the system is not time - reversal symmetric , non - zero quantized hall transport may result .",
    "the simplest perturbation one can introduce that does this is an overall magnetic field in the @xmath109-direction coupling to the spins , which may be a result of an imbalance between the two directions of the exchange field , or simply from an applied magnetic field weak enough that the coupling to orbital motion may be ignored . to the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "[ heff ] this adds a term of the form @xmath110 one can show this indeed opens a gap by examining the hamiltonian @xmath111 when it is projected into the subspace of zero energy states of @xmath48 ( eq . [ heff ] ) . defining pauli matrices @xmath112",

    "[ kstar_basis ] to examine the effects of zeeman fields in the @xmath14 and @xmath15 directions as well ; however we defer this discussion to the next section .",
    "qualitatively , the gap opening is associated with a net effective zeeman field which is predominantly up or down in the @xmath19 direction , so one may expect that the chern number associated with the resulting positive or negative energy band closest to zero energy will be the same as for the corresponding system with a uniform zeeman field .",
    "we have confirmed that this is indeed true . in fig .",
    "[ deltac ] we plot numerically obtained energy levels near the @xmath0 point , in the presence of rashba soc , a piecewise - constant periodic exchange field , and a constant zeeman field @xmath125 .",

    "thus these systems support an quantum anomalous hall effect , in which there is quantized hall transport even in the absence of an orbital magnetic field affecting the electron dynamics .",
    "we finish this section with a non - perturbative analysis of zero modes . to this point",
    "we have focused on zero modes which are located at the @xmath0 and @xmath1 points for @xmath69 , and which split and move out the @xmath10 axis when soc is turned on . in the absence of soc , however , for sufficiently large @xmath139 there will be further dirac points for each spin on the @xmath10 axis @xcite",
    ". we would like to understand how these evolve with @xmath5 .    at present",
    "we are interested in the spectrum of eq .",
    "[ htotal ] when there is antisymmetry in the exchange field , @xmath140 .",
    "eigenstates in such cases may be characterized by a quantum number associated with the reflection operator @xmath59 .",
    "using a transfer matrix approach one may express the condition that a zero mode exists for a given value of @xmath10 as being met if the determinant a particular @xmath77 real matrix @xmath141 vanishes .",
    "the demonstration of this is somewhat involved ; details are provided in the appendix .",
    "[ nonpert ] illustrates a typical evolution of @xmath141 as @xmath5 is raised from zero .",
    "exactly at @xmath69 there are several zeros , reflecting the multiple dirac points expected for this situation @xcite .",
    "it should be noted there are _ two _ degenerate dirac cones around each of these points , one for each value of spin which is a good quantum number in this situation .",
    "when @xmath5 is first raised from zero , these admix and repel , leading to gaps everywhere except near @xmath142 , where the degenerate dirac points at the origin are split into two and move down the @xmath10 axis . with increasing @xmath5 these migrate further from the @xmath0 point , and may interact with residual structure from the higher order dirac points to produce extra dirac points over narrow ranges , as illustrated in fig . [",
    "nonpert](c ) .",
    "with the exception of these situations , however , we find that only the two dirac points predicted by the perturbative analysis are stable when soc is present .",
    "finally , we note that this analysis verifies that corrections at higher orders in perturbation theory do not open gaps at these dirac points .",
    "in this section we explore what happens to the spectrum when the effective zeemen field is not strictly oriented in the @xmath6 direction .",
    "there are two reasons for considering such situations .",
    "firstly , in addition to a periodic field induced by interaction with a substrate , one may introduce a uniform external magnetic field with an arbitrary size and orientation .",
    "such situations are interesting because , as we shall see , the spectrum is relatively sensitive to these , so that one may in principle significantly modify the electronic structure in a single system just by modifying the external field . a second class of systems in which in - plane zeeman fields may be relevant are those in which electrons in the graphene sheet are coupled to a system with magnetic domains with equal and opposite orientations",
    ". such magnetic domain structures are common in many ferromagnets , but the regions separating domains are rarely sharp , and often support domain walls in which the magnetization rotates continuously between opposing directions of the magnetization . thus the electrons encounter localized regions of in - plane field .",
    "similarly , a periodic zeeman field can in principle be implemented by subjecting a folded stack of graphene to an external magnetic field ( which we presume to be sufficiently weak that orbital effects of the field can be ignored . ) in this case the zeeman field effectively rotates in the folded sections of the stack , and once again localized regions of in - plane field will be present .",
    "we begin by examining the simplest of these cases , a uniform zeeman field present in addition to the periodic @xmath7 field .",
    "the impact of an externally imposed uniform zeeman field on the dirac points near the @xmath0 point can be easily assessed perturbatively , using the states appearing in eq .",
    "[ kstar_basis ] in the same way as for @xmath121 ( eq . [ hkstar ] ) to assess the effect of a uniform field in the @xmath109 direction .",
    "following the same procedure we find , for a perturbation of the form @xmath143 , @xmath144 one can see that , as noted before , the @xmath130 contribution opens gaps at the dirac points , while @xmath145 has no qualitative effect on the spectrum , and @xmath146 shifts the dirac point away from zero energy . for the last of these",
    ", the same analysis shows that @xmath146 component shifts the dirac point at @xmath147 in the opposite direction energetically , so that @xmath146 by itself creates both electron - like and hole - like fermi surfaces when the graphene is undoped , enhancing the conductivity of the system .",
    "the choice of orientation of @xmath148 in the @xmath149 plane thus allows one to tune the system between an insulator and a metal .",
    "finally , at this level of approximation it is interesting to note that @xmath145 has no effect on the spectrum .",
    "obtained with the parameters @xmath18=0.05@xmath127 , @xmath128=0.1@xmath127 , @xmath42=43.3@xmath95 and overall exchange fields pointing in the @xmath150 and @xmath52 directions . ]",
