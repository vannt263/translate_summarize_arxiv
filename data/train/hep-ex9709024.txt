    "there is considerable current interest in trying to isolate the lightest glueball .",
    "several experiments have been performed using glue - rich production mechanisms .",
    "one such mechanism is double pomeron exchange ( dpe ) where the pomeron is thought to be a multi - gluonic object .",
    "consequently it has been anticipated that production of glueballs may be especially favoured in this process  [ 2 ] .",
    "the omega central production experiments ( wa76 , wa91 and wa102 ) are designed to study exclusive final states formed in the reaction    pp@xmath2p@xmath3p@xmath4 ,    where the subscripts @xmath5 and @xmath6 refer to the fastest and slowest particles in the laboratory frame respectively and @xmath7 represents the central system .",
    "such reactions are expected to be mediated by double exchange processes where both pomeron and reggeon exchange can occur .",
    "the trigger was designed to enhance double exchange processes with respect to single exchange and elastic processes .",
    "details of the trigger conditions , the data processing and event selection have been given in previous publications  [ 3 ] .",
    "the experiments have been performed at incident beam momenta of 85 , 300 and 450 gev / c , corresponding to centre - of - mass energies of @xmath8 , 23.8 and 28  gev .",
    "theoretical predictions  [ 4 ] of the evolution of the different exchange mechanisms with centre of mass energy , @xmath9 , suggest that    @xmath10(rr ) @xmath11 , + @xmath10(rp ) @xmath12 , + @xmath10(pp ) @xmath13 constant ,    where rr , rp and pp refer to reggeon - reggeon , reggeon - pomeron and pomeron - pomeron exchange respectively .",
    "hence we expect double pomeron exchange ( dpe ) to be more significant at high energies , whereas the reggeon - reggeon and reggeon - pomeron mechanisms will be of decreasing importance .",
    "the decrease of the non - dpe cross section with energy can be inferred from data taken by the wa76 collaboration using pp interactions at @xmath9 of 12.7 gev and 23.8 gev  [ 5 ] .",
    "the mass spectra for the two cases show that the signal - to - background ratio for the @xmath14(770 ) is much lower at high energy , and the wa76 collaboration report that the ratio of the @xmath14(770 ) cross sections at 23.8 gev and 12.7 gev is 0.44  @xmath15  0.07 .",
    "since isospin 1 states such as the @xmath14(770 ) can not be produced by dpe , the decrease of the @xmath16 signal at high @xmath9 is consistent with dpe becoming relatively more important with increasing energy with respect to other exchange processes .",
    "however , even in the case of pure dpe the exchanged particles still have to couple to a final state meson .",
    "the coupling of the two exchanged particles can either be by gluon exchange or quark exchange .",
    "assuming the pomeron is a colour singlet gluonic system if a gluon is exchanged then a gluonic state is produced , whereas if a quark is exchanged then a @xmath17 state is produced ( see figures  [ fi : feyn1]a ) and b ) respectively ) .",
    "it has been suggested recently  [ 6 ] that for small differences in transverse momentum between the two exchanged particles an enhancement in the production of glueballs relative to @xmath1 states may occur .",
    "recently the wa91 collaboration has published a paper  [ 7 ] showing that the observed centrally produced resonances depend on the angle between the outgoing slow and fast protons . in order to describe",
    "the data in terms of a physical model , close and kirk  [ 6 ] , have proposed that the data be analysed in terms of the difference in transverse momentum between the particles exchanged from the fast and slow vertices .",
    "the difference in the transverse momentum vectors ( @xmath0 ) is defined to be    @xmath0 = @xmath18    where @xmath19 , @xmath20 are the y and z components of the momentum of the @xmath21 exchanged particle in the pp centre of mass system  [ 8 ] .    the effect that different cuts in @xmath0 have on the @xmath22 mass spectrum are shown in figures  [ fi:2pi]a ) , b ) and c ) . as can be seen , for @xmath0  @xmath23  0.2  gev",
    "there is effectively no @xmath14(770 ) or signals .",
    "these signals only become apparent as @xmath0 increases .",
    "however the @xmath24 , which is responsible for the sharp drop in the spectrum around 1  gev , is clearly visible in the small @xmath0 sample .",
    "figures  [ fi:2k]a ) , b ) and c ) show the effect of the @xmath0 cut on the @xmath25 mass spectrum where structures can be observed in the 1.5 and 1.7 gev mass region which have been previously identified as the @xmath26(1525 ) and the @xmath27  [ 9 ] . as can be seen , the @xmath26(1525 )",
    "is produced dominantly at high @xmath0 , whereas the @xmath27 is produced dominantly at low @xmath0 .    in the mass spectrum a dramatic effect is observed , see figures  [ fi:2k]d ) , e ) and f ) .",
    "the @xmath28 signal has virtually disappeared at low @xmath0 whereas the @xmath29 and @xmath30 signals remain .",
    "a spin - parity analysis of the @xmath31 channel has been performed  [ 10 ] using an isobar model  [ 11 ] .",
    "the @xmath32 is clearly seen in the @xmath33  @xmath34 and the @xmath28 signal almost disappears at small @xmath0 . in the @xmath35 distribution a peak is observed at 1.45  gev together with a broad enhancement around 2  gev .",
    "the peak in the @xmath35 wave around 1.45 gev remains for @xmath0  @xmath36  0.2  gev while the @xmath37 enhancement at 2.0  gev becomes less important : which shows that the @xmath0 effect is not simply a @xmath38 filter .",
    "a fit has first been performed to the total @xmath35 distribution using a k matrix formalism  [ 12 ] including poles to describe the peak at 1.45 gev as an interference between the @xmath39 , the @xmath29 together with a possible state at 2  gev .",
    "the resulting resonance parameters for the @xmath39 and @xmath29 are very similar to those found by crystal barrel  [ 13 ] .",
    "the peak observed at 1.9  gev , called the @xmath40 , is found to decay to @xmath41 and @xmath42 with @xmath43 . at small @xmath0",
    "the @xmath40 signal is still important .",
    "this is the first evidence of a non - zero spin resonance produced at small @xmath0 and hence shows that the @xmath0 effect is not just a @xmath38  =  @xmath44 filter .",
    "in addition to these waves , a @xmath45 @xmath46 wave was required in the fit .",
    "the @xmath45 @xmath46 wave observed in this experiment is consistent with the two @xmath47 resonances observed by crystal barrel  [ 14 ] with both states decaying to @xmath48 .",
    "the @xmath49 signal is suppressed at small @xmath0 .",
    "this behaviour is consistent with the signals being due to standard @xmath1 states  [ 6 ] .",
    "a similar effect is observed in the  [ 15 ] and  [ 8 ] channels where the @xmath28 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are all more prominent in the large @xmath0 sample and start to disappear at low @xmath0 .",
    "in fact it has been observed that all the undisputed @xmath52 states ( i.e. @xmath53 , @xmath51 , , @xmath28 , @xmath54 etc . ) are suppressed as @xmath0 goes to zero , whereas the glueball candidates @xmath27 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 survive .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the enigmatic @xmath24 , a possible non-@xmath1 meson or @xmath55 molecule state does not behave as a normal @xmath1 state .",
    "a monte carlo simulation of the trigger , detector acceptances and reconstruction program shows that there is very little difference in the acceptance as a function of @xmath0 in the different mass intervals considered within a given channel and hence the observed differences in resonance production can not be explained as acceptance effects .",
    "it has previously been observed that the resonances produced in the central region depend on the four momentum transferred from the fast ( @xmath56 ) and slow vertices ( @xmath57 )  [ 5 ] .",
    "the @xmath22 mass spectrum is shown for the case where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are both less than 0.15 gev@xmath60 in figure  [ fi : tdep]a ) and in figure  [ fi : tdep]b ) for the case when @xmath58 and @xmath59 are both greater than 0.15 gev@xmath60 .",
    "as can be seen the amount of @xmath53 and @xmath61 does change as a function of this cut .",
    "however , in figures  [ fi : tdep]c ) and d ) the @xmath0 distribution for these two cases is shown where it can be seen the events that have small @xmath62 are restricted to small values of @xmath0 . to show that @xmath0 is the most important underlying dynamical effect",
    "the @xmath0 cut has been applied to the sample of events with large @xmath62 .",
    "figures  [ fi : tdep]e ) , f ) and g ) show the events when @xmath58 and @xmath59 are both greater than 0.15 gev@xmath60 for @xmath0  @xmath36  0.2  gev , 0.2  @xmath36  @xmath0  @xmath36  0.5  gev and @xmath0  @xmath63  0.5  gev respectively .",
    "as can be seen the @xmath0 cut still works in this sample and hence it would seem that @xmath0 is the most important cut to be used .    an effect on the resonances observed has also been seen when cuts have been made on the azimuthal angle ( @xmath64 ) between the fast and slow proton .",
    "this angle @xmath64 is related to @xmath0 by    @xmath65    where @xmath66 is the transverse momentum of the central system .",
    "the correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath64 is shown in figure  [ fi : phidep ] .",
    "although cuts in @xmath64 do produce an effect on the resonances observed the effect is not as clear compared to cuts in @xmath0 .",
    "in order to calculate the contribution of each resonance as a function of the @xmath0 the mass spectra have been fitted with the parameters of the resonances fixed to those obtained from the fits to the total data .",
    "the results of these fits are summarised in figure  [ frac ] where the percentage of each resonance as a function of @xmath0 is presented .",
    "figure  [ fracratio ] shows the ratio of the number of events for @xmath0 @xmath23 0.2 gev to the number of events for @xmath0 @xmath67 0.5 gev for each resonance considered .",
    "as can be seen all the undisputed @xmath1 states have a small value for this ratio whereas the interesting states have a high value .",
    "preliminary results show that there is the possibility of a glueball-@xmath1 filter mechanism in central production .",
    "all the undisputed @xmath17 states are observed to be suppressed at small @xmath0 , but the glueball candidates @xmath29 , @xmath27 , and @xmath30 , together with the enigmatic @xmath24 , survive .    the wa102 collaboration : d. barberis , w. beusch , f.g .",
