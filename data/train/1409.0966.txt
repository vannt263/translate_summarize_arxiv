    "considering relevant works that aim at pu traffic classification ,  @xcite was the first to deal with traffic pattern classification in dsa networks .",
    "therein , the classification of the traffic pattern was done by using the autocorrelation function of the received pu signal .",
    "work of  @xcite improved the classification algorithm of  @xcite by filtering away the errors that were caused by noise and incorrect spectrum sensing . inspired by machine learning , the authors in  @xcite proposed two behavior classifiers , namely a naive bayesian classifier and an averaged one - dependence estimation classifier to classify the channel selection strategy for sus .",
    "however , the authors of  @xcite considered the pu traffic pattern to be either stochastic or deterministic , without assigning the pu traffic to a specific distribution .",
    "furthermore , the classifier of  @xcite did not take the distributions of pu traffic but only the mean busy / idle time into consideration .",
    "we thus conclude , to the best of our knowledge , the performance of pu traffic classification is still relatively unexplored from the theoretical point of view .",
    "this motivated us to perform detailed theoretical studies of pu traffic classification .",
    "considering the classification of gamma - distributed pu busy / idle time collected through an error - free spectrum sensing process , the contribution of our work is fourfold :    1 .",

    "when probability of pu period change in - between two samples ( busy - to - idle - to - busy or idle - to - busy - to - idle ) is negligible , we evaluate ( i ) a minimum variance pu state length estimator , and ( ii ) propose a modified maximum likelihood classifier , quantifying its performance analytically and providing design guidelines based on traffic parameters ; 4 .   finally , we propose ( i ) a pu traffic estimate - then - classify scheme which requires no complete knowledge of the pu traffic parameters , and ( ii ) an average likelihood function method which requires knowledge on the statistics of the pu traffic parameters when they fluctuate in time domain .",

    "we consider a single channel randomly accessed by a pu . to ease the analysis we disregard ( i ) the effect of incidental su operation within a pu band , i.e. , the injection of su traffic into pu traffic which obfuscates the correct classification of the latter , and ( ii ) the effect of spectrum sensing errors . the assumption ( ii )",
    "is taken consciously , as the problem of traffic classification is strictly coupled with the spectrum sensing problem and requires a separate analytical study due to its complexity .",

    "second , we observe that the performance for higher number of pu traffic periods is more sensitive to the pu traffic period estimation error . therefore more pu traffic samples for higher number of pu traffic periods are needed to achieve the same performance as with a lower number of pu traffic periods . finally , we show that for a small average distance among hypotheses , the performance loss is large since in this case the pu traffic classification is more sensitive to the period estimation errors .    in fig .",

    "we provide two examples for the design guideline shown in section  [ sec : guideline ] .",
    "first we consider the case where , given observation time @xmath150 , we need to find the number of traffic samples and therefore sampling period @xmath72 , to achieve a certain probability of correct classification . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4a ] we observe that as the number of traffic samples increases the classification performance improves .",
    "this is because as the number of traffic samples increases , the period estimation errors decrease , and at the same time , we can obtain more pu traffic periods as the pu traffic period mis - detection rate decreases which is shown in  ( [ eq : k ] ) .",
    "furthermore , as the observation time increases , the classification performance also increase .",
    "although in this case the estimation error increases , the obtained traffic periods increases .",
    "this is because the latter factor has more influence on the classification performance . in this traffic scenario , for example ,",
    "given the timing constraint @xmath212seconds we need at least @xmath213 traffic samples to achieve the performance @xmath214 .",
    "this means the constraint for the sampling rate @xmath72 to sample this traffic should be no less than @xmath215seconds to achieve the classification performance of @xmath214 .",
    "second we consider the case where , given the number of samples , we need to find the observation time to achieve a certain classification performance . from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4b ] , the performance is a concave curve with respect to the observation time .",
    "this can be explained by the behavior of  ( [ eq : k ] ) . in  ( [ eq : k ] ) , @xmath160 versus @xmath150 has a similar shape as @xmath141 versus @xmath150 .",
    "however , to figure out the classification performance , not only @xmath160 but also the sampling period @xmath72 needs to be considered to determine the classification performance . initially , as @xmath150 increases , @xmath160 increases , and @xmath72 increases .",
    "since the effect of @xmath160 is more significant , the classification performance increases . as @xmath150 increases through the maximum point of @xmath160 , @xmath160 starts to decrease . in this region",
    "@xmath72 also increases .",
    "therefore the performance will decrease since we obtain less traffic periods with higher estimation errors . in this traffic scenario , for example , given the energy constraint @xmath216 , we can solve for the optimal observation time @xmath217seconds to achieve the maximal performance @xmath218 .",
    "this means the optimal sampling rate @xmath72 to sample this traffic should be set as @xmath219seconds to achieve @xmath218 .",
    "larger and smaller @xmath72 than the optimal @xmath72 will both degrade the classification performance .",
    "finally , we see that our proposed analytical approximation matches the simulation results for small values of @xmath72 . but as @xmath72 increases , shown in fig .",

    "third , the simulation results for etc - based mlc matches our proposed analytical results in  ( [ eq : pcf ] ) , since the number of pu traffic periods is large enough for parameter estimation .",
    "finally , we can observe that etc - based method will perform worse under test i than test ii , compared with the perfect classifiers .",
    "this is because in test ii the first moments for all hypotheses are set to be the same , hence the estimated parameters will be close to the true parameters for all hypotheses .",
    "but this is not the case for test i since the first moments are more different for all hypotheses  which means a small parameter estimation error will cause a large classification performance degradation .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : partial ] we present the classification performance comparisons assuming prior knowledge about the distribution of pu traffic parameters @xmath10 .",
    "we note that alf - based classifiers are better than etc - based classifiers under test i , and the result is opposite under test ii .",
    "this is because of the fact that alf can capture most pu traffic parameter information if the distance among hypotheses is large , i.e. , the test i case .",
    "if the distance among hypotheses is small , as in test ii , etc - based method provides a more accurate pu traffic parameter estimation .",
    "we propose novel primary user ( pu ) traffic classification algorithms which are based on the maximum likelihood function and multi - hypothesis sequential probability ratio test classifiers , and we consider cases where the pu traffic periods and pu traffic parameters need to be estimated . in addition , we analyze a sampling technique to estimate pu traffic periods , and a minimum variance period estimator is derived to design a traffic classifier given sensing constraints such as the number of traffic samples or observation time .",
    "furthermore , we propose two classifiers , estimate - then - classify ( etc ) and average likelihood function ( alf ) classifiers to handle the cases when there is only no / partial knowledge of pu traffic parameters .    to conclude , for pu traffic with constant and known parameters , msprtc , a more complicated classifier than mlc",
