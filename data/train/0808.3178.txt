    "in realistic conditions , it is impossible to completely isolate a quantum system @xmath0 from its environment @xmath1 .",
    "a proper analysis of the quantum dynamics of @xmath0 must therefore take into account the decoherence effect of @xmath0 induced by @xmath1 .",
    "conventional approaches to a theoretical study of the dynamics of such an open quantum system have treated the interactions between @xmath0 and @xmath1 perturbatively . invoking the born - markov approximation ,",
    "these yield approximate equations of motion such as the redfield or master equations @xcite for the reduced system we are interested in .",
    "the born - markovian approximation works well when the environment correlation time @xmath2 is small compared to the time scale @xmath3 for significant change in @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "however , in the light of recent experiments ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , it is evident that there are many physically relevant situations where the markovian assumption does not hold , and a non - markovian treatment of the open system dynamics is necessary .",
    "furthermore , there is a general interest in the fundamental theory of open quantum systems to extend the well - developed concepts and methods for markovian dynamics to the non - markovian case .",
    "the development of a general description to open quantum system has thus attracted much attention lately .",
    "some recent works exploring the non - markovian decoherence properties of quantum systems include refs .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the exact non - markovian decoherence dynamics of a single - mode optical field system - a basic building block in quantum communication and computation @xcite . indeed , many of the quantum information processing protocols @xcite , especially in the field of continuous - variable quantum information processing @xcite , involve optical fields . in practice",
    ", the optical field inevitably interacts with surrounding environment , which always results in the decoherence of the optical field .",
    "actually , this decoherence effect still exists even when the optical field is transmitted in an optical fiber @xcite .",
    "decoherence will undoubtedly have a detrimental influence on the performance of the protocols .",
    "it is thus very important for one to have a complete quantitative understanding of the destructive influences of the environment .",
    "many of the current quantum optical experiments are performed at low temperatures , under vacuum condition . in this case , the main source of decoherence is the vacuum fluctuation .",
    "many of the theoretical studies on the decoherence dynamics of an optical field to date rely on the born - markovian approximation @xcite .",
    "we note that , only very recently , some phenomenological models on non - markovian decoherence dynamics of optical fields have been studied @xcite . based on perturbation",
    ", these may not capture all the characteristics of the exact non - markovian dynamics . a more satisfactory theory , derived from first principles , that describes an open optical field system is thus desirable .",
    "to this end , we apply the influence - functional method of feynman and vernon @xcite to the study of the system @xmath0 of a single - mode optical field that interacts with an environment @xmath1 , consisting of a set of harmonic oscillators at zero temperature .",
    "the feynman - vernon influence functional theory allows one to derive the exact non - markovian dynamics of @xmath0 . in this method ,",
    "the density operator of the combined system , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , is expressed as a double path integral .",
    "the exact dynamics of the reduced system @xmath0 is then obtained by integrating this path integral over the degrees of freedom of @xmath1 .",
    "the effective action that governs the evolution of @xmath0 thus consists of the free action of @xmath0 and an influence functional .",
    "all the environmental effects on @xmath0 are dynamically incorporated in the influence functional , and both the backactions from @xmath1 to @xmath0 and from @xmath0 to @xmath1 can be treated self - consistently . in our analysis , we mainly address the issues about how the non - markovian effect takes action and what its influence on the decoherence dynamics of the optical field system in different parameter regimes is .",
    "as an explicit example , we will study the time evolution of the so - called schrdinger cat state @xcite and see what an exact treatment of its decoherence dynamics would yield .",
    "indeed , it had been shown that non - markovian effect shows its significant consequence on the decoherence dynamics just by a transient oscillation in short time scale @xcite . here",
    ", we will show , besides this transient oscillation in short time scale , the non - markovian effect can also influence the behavior of steady state in long - time scale when @xmath4 or @xmath5 .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce a model of the single - mode optical field in an environment , and the coherent - state representation . in sec .",
    "iii , we present a detailed derivation of the quantum non - markovian master equation using influence functional theory in the coherent - state representation .",
    "our generalized master equation has time - dependent frequency shift and decay rate , and it reduces to the general markovian one under certain approximation .",
    "iv is devoted to a numerical study of the system decoherence dynamics for different environmental correlation time scales .",
    "in particular , the decoherence dynamics of the schrdinger cat state @xcite is investigated explicitly .",
    "finally , a summary is given in sec .",
    "we consider a single - mode optical field @xmath0 that interacted with an environment @xmath1 . the environment , as usual ,",
    "is modeled by a collection of harmonic oscillators .",
    "the total hamiltonian governing the coupled @xmath0 and @xmath1 is given by @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the hamiltonian of the free single - mode optical field @xmath0 , @xmath8 is the hamiltonian of the environment @xmath1 , and @xmath9 is a model for the system - environment interaction . @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the annihilation and creation operators of the single - mode optical field @xmath0 with frequency @xmath12 . similarly , @xmath13 and",

    "the environment is assumed to be at zero temperature initially . by this model",
    "we will address the decoherence mechanism of @xmath0 due to its energy exchange with the modes of the environmental vacuum fluctuation .",
    "we emphasize the model and formulation developed in the following are also applicable to many similar systems in quantum optics , for example , an optical field in a leaky cavity @xcite or in an optical fiber @xcite , and the noise effect on a nanomechanical oscillator @xcite .",

    "this is the exact master equation for the reduced system dynamics .",
    "our exact master equation ( [ mas ] ) is similar to the non - markovian master equation of a two - level atom in a bosonic environment @xcite .",
    "this similarity for the fully different systems comes from the fact that both the derivations are based on the rotating wave approximation and the initial vacuum state of the environment .",
    "@xmath92 , named as time - dependent lamb shifted frequency in the two - level atom system , plays here the role of a time - dependent shifted frequency of the single - mode optical field @xmath0 induced by the environment @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath93 represents a time - dependent decay rate of the optical field .",
    "we emphasize that our derivation of the master equation goes beyond the born - markovian approximation and contains all the backactions between @xmath1 and @xmath0 self - consistently .",
    "it can be seen that the only difference between eq .",
    "( [ mas ] ) and the master equation under born - markovian approximation @xcite is the time - dependent coefficients .",
    "so we argue that all the non - markovian characteristics reside in the time - dependent coefficients of the generalized master equation .    the time - dependent coefficients in our generalized master equation , determined by eq .",
    "( [ go ] ) , essentially depend on the so - called spectral density , which characterizes the coupling strength of the environment to the system with respect to the environmental frequencies .",
    "it is defined as @xmath94 . in the continuous limit of the environmental frequencies , we model in our work the coupling of the optical field with the environment has a spectral density as @xmath95 where @xmath96 is a dimensionless coupling constant , and @xmath97 is an exponential cutoff frequency .",
    "the environment is classified into three categories @xcite : sub - ohmic if @xmath98 , ohmic if @xmath99 , and super - ohmic if @xmath100 .",
    "different spectral densities manifest different non - markovian decoherence dynamics @xcite .",
    "the spectral density eq .",
    "( [ sp ] ) is motivated by the physical consideration that not all the modes of the environment give the same contribution to the coupling to the optical field system .",
    "thus , the spectral density form is physically reasonable to model the decoherence of our optical field system .",
    "actually such spectral density , especially the ohmic one , is widely used in the the decoherence analysis of optical fields in the scenario of the continuous variable quantum information processing @xcite .    before presenting our numerical results in the next section ,",
    "we show how our generalized master equation reduces to the conventional master equation by introducing the relevant markovian approximation . by defining new dynamical variables as @xmath101",
    ", we can recast the first equation of eqs.([eom ] ) into @xmath102 then , invoking the markovian approximation , @xmath103 , namely , approximately taking the dynamical variable to be the one that depends only on the present time so that any memory effect is ignored .",
    "the markovian approximation is mainly based on the physical assumption that the correlation time of the environment is much smaller compared with the typical time scale of the system evolution . also under this assumption",
    "we can extend the upper limit of the @xmath104 integration in eq .",
    "( [ nn ] ) to infinity and use the equality @xmath105 where @xmath106 denotes the cauchy principal value .",
    "the integro - differential equation ( [ nn ] ) thus reduces to a linear ordinary differential equation .",
    "the solution of @xmath107 , as well as @xmath54 can then be obtained readily , which results in @xmath108 with @xmath109 . using this solution",
    ", one can verify from eq .",
    "( [ go ] ) that @xmath110 which are precisely the coefficients in the markovian master equation of the optical system @xcite .    in the next section , for definiteness , we consider ohmic environment @xmath1 .",
    "the characteristic time scale @xmath2 of the environmental correlation function in the ohmic case is roughly inversely proportional to the cutoff frequency @xmath111 in eq .",
    "( [ sp ] ) , i.e. , @xmath112 @xcite .",
    "the cutoff frequency @xmath113 , which is originally introduced to eliminate infinities in frequency integrations , therefore also determines if the dynamics of open system @xmath0 is markovian or non - markovian .",
    "our non - perturbatively derived exact results can allow us to explore all these possibilities .",
    "to illuminate the non - markovian decoherence dynamics of @xmath0 , we consider the following initial state of the optical field : @xmath114,\\ ] ] where @xmath115 is a normalization constant .",
    "this is known as the schrdinger cat state and has been produced experimentally @xcite .",

    "[ fr1 ] , we plot the numerical results of the decay rate @xmath120 , frequency shift @xmath121 , and purity @xmath122 when @xmath123 .",
    "we note that the exact @xmath120 and @xmath121 differ from their corresponding values obtained via a markovian treatment only over a very short time interval . for @xmath124 , both coefficients grow very quickly , while for @xmath125 , they gradually approach the corresponding markovian results , given by eqs .",
    "( [ mr ] ) , as @xmath126 approaches @xmath3 .",
    "the finite , almost steady , positive decay rate guarantees the irreversibility of the system dynamics .",
    "accordingly , the exact time evolution of the purity shows only slight deviation from the markovian results .",
    "the schrdinger cat state eventually evolves to a steady state , namely the ground state of @xmath0 : latexmath:[$\\rho_g =    environment @xmath1 has negligible effect on the dynamics of system @xmath0 , and the markovian approximation is applicable .",
    "we say the system dynamics is mainly governed by the dissipative effect of @xmath1 .",
    "figure [ fre ] shows the decay rate @xmath120 , frequency shift @xmath121 , and purity @xmath122 , when @xmath128 . in this case",
    ", the backaction of the environment @xmath1 has a considerable impact on the dynamics of our system @xmath0 , and the markovian approximation is not applicable .",
    "firstly , we note that , in contrast to the markovian treatment , the decay rate can take negative values .",
    "physically , this corresponds to @xmath0 reabsorbing a photon from @xmath1 , which will lead to an increase in the photon number of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "next , more interestingly , we note that the decay rate approaches zero asymptotically , which dramatically differs from the markovian results .",
    "consequently , the exact evolution of the schrdinger cat state is drastically different from the markovian results . in particular , it eventually evolves to some steady state , which is not the ground state @xmath129 .",
    "the backaction of the environment causes the system to undergo transient oscillations , which is characteristic of non - markovian dynamics . from previous studies @xcite ,",
    "one would have concluded that non - markovian effects only show up in short - time dynamics .",
    "our results , however , clearly show on the contrary that non - markovian effects can also have an influence on the long - time behavior of the system dynamics and the final steady state of @xmath0 .",
    "this is because that the dissipative effect of @xmath1 is strongly counteracted by the effect due to the backaction of @xmath1 .",
    "the results under the condition @xmath130 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fre3 ] . because of the extremely long memory effect of the environment , the backaction from @xmath1 to @xmath0 is so strong that it governs the dynamics of @xmath0 .",
    "this causes the decay rate to oscillate over a very long duration .",
    "this is typical of non - markovian dynamics @xcite .",
    "the ` equilibrium ' position for the oscillation of @xmath120 is not at zero , but a small positive value .",
    "the positivity of the equilibrium position of the decay rate oscillation makes the system dynamics experiences weak dissipation .",
    "such weak dissipation is verified by the time evolution of the purity of the schrdinger cat state in fig .",
    "the evolution of @xmath122 also shows that the coherent oscillation induced by the backaction of @xmath1 persists for a very long time , even as the state approaches the ground state .    in summary",
    ", depending on @xmath2 in comparison to @xmath3 , the decoherence dynamics of @xmath0 shows different behaviors . for @xmath131 ,",
    "the exact results show only slight deviation from the markovian ones .",
    "since the effect due to backaction of @xmath1 is extremely small , the system dynamics is mainly governed by the dissipative effect of @xmath1 , and the widely used markovian approximation is applicable . for @xmath128 , the considerable backaction induced by the near resonant interaction between @xmath1 and @xmath0",
    "counteracts the dissipative effect , and results in zero decay rate asymptotically .",
    "this causes dissipation to cease before the system decays to its ground state .",
    "that is , the steady state is no longer the ground state , unlike the previous case . when @xmath130 , the backaction of @xmath1 is so strong that it governs the dynamics of @xmath0 .",
    "the decay rate of the system oscillates about some equilibrium position over a very long period of time .",
    "the positivity of such an equilibrium position guarantees the overall weak dissipation effect of @xmath1 .",
    "in this work , using the influence - functional method of feynman and vernon , we investigate the exact decoherence dynamics of a single - mode optical field @xmath0 in an environment at zero temperature .",
    "we derive an exact generalized master equation for @xmath0 .",
    "the equation s time - dependent coefficients depend on the environmental spectral density .",
    "these determine the exact dynamics of @xmath0 .",
    "we conclude from our numerical results that @xmath1 exerts two competing influences on @xmath0 .",
    "one effect , @xmath132 , is dissipation , and is responsible for the decoherence of @xmath0 .",
    "the other , @xmath133 , is due to the backactions of @xmath1 on @xmath0 .",
    "the backaction of @xmath1 on @xmath0 means that @xmath1 with its state changed due to interaction with @xmath0 , in turn , exerts its dynamical influence back on @xmath0 .",
    "this is the physical origin of the non - markovian dynamics of @xmath0 . in the conventional born - markovian treatment",
    ", one generally neglects the backaction of the environment .",
    "so , in that case , we do not see the effect due to backaction on the dynamics of @xmath0 .",
    "the degree of manifestation of @xmath132 and @xmath133 in the dynamics of @xmath0 depends on @xmath2 in comparison with @xmath3 . for @xmath131 ,",
    "@xmath132 dominates and @xmath133 only gives rise to a transient coherent oscillation of @xmath0 .",
    "the state of @xmath0 evolves to the ground state @xmath129 , which is coincident with the markovian result .",
    "if @xmath134 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 are comparable and their effects counteract each other .",
    "the state of @xmath0 asymptotically evolves to some steady state , which is not the ground state of @xmath0 .",
    "finally , when @xmath130 , @xmath133 dominates and governs the dynamics of @xmath0 .",
    "the state of @xmath0 eventually approaches to the ground state but never quite reach it .",
    "the theory we have established is a non - perturbative description of the exact decoherence dynamics of a single - mode optical field .",
    "it is a generalization of the well - developed born - markovian treatment of such system .",
    "it can serve as a useful basic theoretical model in analyzing the non - markovian decoherence dynamics of optical fields employed in practical quantum information processing schemes .",
