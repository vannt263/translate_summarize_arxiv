    "the boundary dynamics has been providing interesting problems for physics and mathematics .",
    "a famous one is the problem of crystal growth from a supercooled melt@xcite ; as the melt is solidified and a crystal grows , a flat interface between the solid and the liquid phases becomes unstable due to the coupling of the solidification process with the diffusion of latent heat generated at the interface ( mullins - sekerka instability@xcite ) .",
    "this results in the fascinating variety of dendritic growths of crystal under the interplay with anisotropic surface tension .",
    "another example is the viscous fingering , which appears when the air is injected into a viscous fluid ( saffman - taylor instability @xcite ) .",
    "the viscous fluid is displaced by the pressure gradient , and the pressure field is governed by laplace equation with proper boundary conditions . since laplace equation is the diffusion equation with the infinite diffusion constant , the viscous fingering is the large diffusion limit of the crystal growth .",
    "a new example of boundary dynamics is presented by a simple experiment of yamazaki and mizuguchi@xcite ; the mixture of water and corn starch powder is sandwiched between two glass plates . after a several hours , a labyrinthine pattern of dried corn starch will be formed when the water is evaporated from the gap of the glass plates .",
    "the system is two - dimensional , and the pattern is formed by the water - air interface line as it sweeps the system to collect the granules along it by means of the surface tension .",
    "the grains are simply accumulated along the interface line to give friction against the interface motion , and eventually get stuck with the glass plates .    in the above experiment , the granules play an analogous role to that of the latent heat in the crystal growth ; they are distributed in the wet ( or melted ) region , but show up when the interface passes ; the interface speed is controlled by the granule density ( or temperature ) at the boundary .",
    "the difference is that the granules do not diffuse while the heat does . in this sense , this _ sweeping dynamics _ is the small diffusion limit of mullins - sekerka problem ; that is the opposite limit to saffman - taylor problem but has not been investigated yet in detail .",
    "analogous instabilities exist for these phenomena ; a protruded part of interface advances faster because the generated heat diffuses faster ( mullins - sekerka ) , the pressure gradient is larger ( saffman - taylor ) , or the accumulated granules are diluted over the elongated interface at the convex region ( sweeping dynamics ) .",
    "similarities is seen in the phase field model proposed for this sweeping phenomenon@xcite .",
    "the model consists of two fields : the phase field and the coupling field ; the coupling field represents the granular density , instead of the temperature in the crystal growth@xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated the model is capable to reproduce some feature of the patterns obtained in the experiment@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will construct the model of the boundary dynamics for the sweeping interface based on geometrical and physical considerations , and study its behavior .",
    "let us start by defining the cartesian coordinate in the two dimensional system near the interface between the swept ( dry ) and the unswept ( wet ) region as in fig.[f-1](a ) . in the unswept region ,",
    "the granules are distributed at the area density @xmath0 , which we assume constant in this paper , for simplicity .",
    "suppose that the interface position at the time @xmath1 is represented parametrically by @xmath2 with the parameter @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath4 be the natural coordinate along the interface , then the length element @xmath5 is @xmath6 we define the tangential and the normal unit vectors of the interface , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , by @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the unit vector along the @xmath11 axis perpendicular to the system ; the normal vector @xmath8 is pointing into the unswept region .",
    "the curvature @xmath12 is defined as @xmath13 which is positive when the interface is convex toward the unswept side .    in the drying process",
    ", the interface moves upwards . using an appropriate parameterization of @xmath3 in eq.([vec_r ] )",
    ", @xmath14 can be made parallel to @xmath8 , then the normal speed of the interface motion @xmath15 is defined by @xmath16",
    "we now consider the sweeping dynamics where the granules are swept by the interface ; they are accumulated along the interface and conveyed by it in its normal direction .",
    "if we ignore the width of the region where the granules are accumulated , then the accumulated granules are described by the line density @xmath17 along the interface .    in the case where the granules are simply accumulated along the interface and do not diffuse at all , the equation for @xmath17 is determined geometrically and should be given by @xmath18 \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq - sigma}\\ ] ] the first term of the right hand side simply represents the sweeping accumulation .",
    "the second term comes from the change of the interface length as it advances ; the length element along the interface increases by the factor @xmath19 during the short time period @xmath20 , thus the line density decreases by the factor of its inverse .",
    "the interface speed @xmath15 , on the other hand , is given by the product of the following two factors , i.e. the driving force to the interface , and the mobility of the interface ; ( i ) the driving force comes from the pressure difference @xmath21 between the wet and the dry regions ; as the water evaporates , the volume of the wet region tends to shrink , then the interface recedes due to the pressure difference .",
    "when the interface is curved , the driving force is given by the effective pressure difference @xmath22 with @xmath23 being the surface tension , thus is proportional to the factor @xmath24 with the capillary length @xmath25 .",
    "( ii ) the mobility depends upon the granule density @xmath17 and should be a decreasing function of it because the granule friction with the glass plates resists the interface motion .",
    "the mobility becomes zero at @xmath26 when the interface gets stuck with granules .",
    "in the simplest case where no other scales of @xmath17 are involved , we can write down the equation for the interface speed as @xmath27 with the characteristic speed @xmath28 and the dimensionless mobility @xmath29 , which is a decreasing function with @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "eqs.([eq - sigma ] ) and ( [ eq - speed ] ) define the boundary dynamics of the sweeping interface , which shows morphological instability analogous to the crystal growth dynamics ; the part of the interface with @xmath32 tends to advance faster when @xmath33 .",
    "the model contains four parameters , @xmath0 , @xmath28 , @xmath26 , and @xmath34 , from which we can define the stuck - in distance @xmath35 and the stuck - in time @xmath36 by @xmath37 which are the distance and the time that the flat interface can advances before it gets stuck .    in order to simplify the expressions ,",
    "in the following , we employ the dimensionless unit system where @xmath38 , then eqs.([eq - sigma ] ) and ( [ eq - speed ] ) are in the form of @xmath39 \\ , , \\label{eq - sigma-2 } \\\\",
    "v_n(t , s ) & = &   f\\bigl(\\sigma(t , s)\\bigr ) \\bigl ( 1-r\\kappa(t , s)\\bigr ) \\ , , \\label{eq - speed-2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the only one dimensionless parameter @xmath40 this is the ratio of the capillary length to the stuck - in distance and is a measure of the effect of the surface tension .    the functional form of the dimensionless mobility @xmath41 in eq.([eq - speed-2 ]",
    ") should reflect the physical mechanism how the interface slows down and gets stuck due to the accumulated granules . here",
    ", we employ the simplest form @xmath42",
    "now , we study the interface dynamics based on eqs.([eq - sigma-2]),([eq - speed-2 ] ) , and ( [ f - function ] ) .      for the flat interface , @xmath43 , thus the solution",
    "is easily obtained as @xmath44 the flat interface can advance only by @xmath35(=1 ) before it gets stuck because it simply accumulates material .",
    "a possible mode of steady advance is the extending one - dimensional finger of the width of @xmath45 by shoving the granules asides(fig.[f-1](b ) ) .",
    "this type of steadily extending finger solution can be obtained as follows .",
    "suppose the finger is extending in the @xmath46 direction with the speed @xmath47 , then eqs.([eq - sigma-2 ] ) and ( [ eq - speed-2 ] ) become @xmath48 where the primes denote the derivative by the natural coordinate @xmath4 .",
    "then , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are related as @xmath51 thus , eqs .",
    "( [ steady-1 ] )  ( [ steady-3 ] ) can be solved for @xmath52 , @xmath46 , and @xmath17 as functions of @xmath4 under the physical boundary conditions @xmath53 for a given set of @xmath54 and @xmath47 .    for a given @xmath54 ,",
    "a steady solution is possible for a finite range of @xmath47 ; the condition at the tip that @xmath55 and @xmath56 at @xmath57 in eqs.([steady-1 ] ) and ( [ steady-2 ] ) leads to the allowed range of @xmath47 , @xmath58    eqs.([steady-1])([steady-3 ] ) can be solved numerically .",
    "fig.[f-2 ] shows some of the steady solutions for the finger shape and the line density @xmath17 for @xmath59 with @xmath60 , 0.2 , and 0.3 .",
    "one can see that the finger tip is sharper for the larger extending speed @xmath47 .     with @xmath61 , 0.2 , and 0.1 .",
    "( a ) shapes of the finger .",
    "the plots for different speeds are shifted to avoid overlapping .",
    "only the part near the tip is shown for each finger .",
    "( b ) the line density of granules v.s .",
    "the finger tip is located at @xmath57 .",
    ", width=302 ]    the line density @xmath17 shows rather intriguing behavior as a function of @xmath4 ; the tip density is smaller for the larger @xmath47 , but for @xmath47 larger than a certain value for a given @xmath54 , @xmath17 becomes singular at the tip and eventually develops a cusp .",
    "actually , by expanding @xmath17 around the tip , it can be shown that @xmath17 becomes non - analytic @xmath62 with @xmath63 when @xmath64 < v < ( 1-\\sqrt r)^2   . \\label{sing - range}\\ ] ] the singularity at the tip in the line density is a peculiar result of the model without diffusion .",
    "we have derived the steady finger solutions , which are smooth and analytic except at the finger tip , but in a general time development , the diffusionless feature of the model seems to cause the ultra - violet catastrophe , or the short wave length instability , even though we have taken account of the surface tension effect by introducing the capillary length .",
    "actually , numerical simulations of the equations eventually yield a zigzag structure of the solution in the shortest discretization length ; this can not be accepted as a solution of the differential equations .",
    "mathematically , the problem is that the surface tension effect in eq.([eq - speed-2 ] ) is of the same form as @xmath12 with the term that causes the instability in eq.([eq - sigma-2 ] ) , thus the surface tension effect never dominates to suppress the instability even in the short wave length limit , unlike in the case of mullines - sekerka / saffman - taylor problems .",
    "this may be seen in the linear stability analysis of the flat interface solution ( [ flat])@xcite .",
    "since the flat interface solution is not steady , the linearized equations for the small deviation from it are not of constant coefficient , thus the analysis is not simple , but within the approximation where the time variation is neglected during the time scale of the perturbation ( quasi - steady approximation ) , the growth rate @xmath65 of the unstable perturbation with the wave number @xmath66 in the unstable branch can be obtained as @xmath67 , \\ ] ] where @xmath68 ; @xmath69 and @xmath70 are given by eq.([flat ] ) .",
    "this is positive for any @xmath71 when @xmath72 and @xmath73 suggesting the ultra - violet catastrophe , thus the model is not well defined in the continuum limit .",
    "in order to avoid this instability , we introduce the diffusion term along the interface in eq.([eq - sigma-2 ] ) as @xmath74         + { \\partial\\over\\partial\\ell}\\left(\\ell_d v_n            { \\partial\\sigma\\over\\partial\\ell}\\right ) \\label{eq - sigma-3}\\ ] ] with a new small length scale @xmath75 .",
    "the adopted form represents the diffusion flux along the interface ; the flux is proportional to the interface speed @xmath15 .",
    "such a diffusion flux is natural in the case where the diffusion is driven by the interface motion ; the grains are driven randomly along the interface by the distance @xmath75 during the time @xmath76 , i.e. the time during which the interface moves by @xmath75 in the normal direction .",
    "note that we do not assume the diffusion perpendicular to the interface .",
    "the linear stability analysis within the same approximation as above gives the perturbation growth rate @xmath77 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which gives @xmath78 therefore the catastrophe is suppressed .     with @xmath79 , 0.1 , and 0.05 .",

    "i have performed simulations on the model with this diffusion in order to see if the finger solutions are stable .",
    "let us start by examining the effect of the length scale @xmath75 .",
    "fig.[f-3 ] shows the results of simulations of eqs.([eq - speed-2 ] ) and ( [ eq - sigma-3 ] ) for @xmath59 with @xmath79 , 0.1 , and 0.05 .",

    "only the right halves of the interfaces are shown and the time development is represented by the plots with the time interval @xmath82 .",
    "i have confirmed the ultra - violet catastrophe is suppressed by the diffusion term ; except for the cusps at the edges of sticking regions , numerical solutions converges to a smooth solution as the smaller time and space discretization is used for integral in contrast with the diffusionless model , where the zigzag structure in the smallest discretization scale develops eventually all over the interface due to the ultra - violet catastrophe . in all cases of fig.[f-3 ] , the fingers extend at a speed of 0.1 initially with keeping the initial shape as the steady solution does , but eventually the finger becomes unstable and develops wavy structures .",
    "the length scale of the emerging structure is shorter for the smaller @xmath75 , but they are much larger than @xmath75 .",
    "we do not see any tendency that the steady solution becomes stable for small @xmath75 even though the initial configuration of the steady solution for the speed @xmath60 with @xmath59 is outside the range eq.([sing - range ] ) , thus does not have a singularity in @xmath17 at the tip .",
    "fig.[f-4 ] shows the results for the case of @xmath59 and @xmath83 .",

    "one may see some differences in the way how the steady solutions are destabilized for different speeds , but again the steady solutions are unstable for all the cases , and complex developments of the boundary are seen after the instability .     and",
    "@xmath83 from some initial configurations .",

    "the time sequences are shown with the time interval @xmath82 .",
    ", width=302 ]    the unstable development seen in figs.3 and 4 shows some similarities to the pattern found in @xcite ; concave parts of the interface evolve eventually into cusps with the tip size of @xmath75 , and the interface are pinned by them .",
    "this leads to the irregular development of the interface although there is no randomness in the present model .",
    "before concluding , let us make some remarks .    first of all , the sweeping phenomena can be seen commonly ; it is not limited to the specific experiment we referred to , although there have not been many controlled experiments and theoretical analyses .",
    "another example may be found in a pattern formation of deposit in a drying droplet@xcite .",
    "actual situations varies and may not be as simple as the one we have analyzed in this paper , but there should be a class of phenomena characterized by the sweeping phenomenon as is discussed here .    secondly , the boundary dynamics should be able to be derived from the phase field model as the narrow interface width limit . in the case of crystal growth and the viscous fingering ,",
    "the interface width is the shortest length scale in the problem , and the boundary dynamics can be derived from the phase field model by taking appropriate limits@xcite . on the other hand , in the sweeping phenomenon , the length scale over which the granular density varies in the normal direction to the interface is in the same order with the interface width@xcite , which complicates the formal derivation of the boundary dynamics .",
    "lastly , some comments on the diffusion are in order .",
    "we have formulated the sweeping dynamics as the small diffusion limit , but in a real system , some form of diffusion should exist .",
    "we have also found that the diffusionless model shows the short wave instability . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the ordinary diffusion is assumed within the interface , which results in patterns with a larger scale for a slower process ; this does not seem to agree with the experiment . on the other hand , we regularized the model with the diffusion characterized by the short length scale @xmath75 , which may correspond to the grain size in the experiment@xcite .",
    "the diffusion along the interface is considered to be driven by the interface motion , thus the grains do not diffuse when the interface gets stuck , therefore , the slower interface motion does not lead to a larger scale .    in summary ,",
    "the boundary dynamics of the sweeping interface is constructed based upon geometrical and physical analysis of the process . to suppress the short length scale instability , the diffusion driven by the interface motion along the interface",
    "is introduced with the short length scale @xmath75 . in the case of no diffusion ,",
    "we obtain the steadily propagating finger solutions for a finite range of propagation speed , but the numerical simulations with the small diffusion suggests that they are unstable , and a complex behavior of the interface is seen .",
