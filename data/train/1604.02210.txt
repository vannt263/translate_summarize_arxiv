    "it is well known that general relativity ( gr ) is consistent with several solar system experimental tests . however , in order to explain the galaxies rotation curves and the deflection of light by galaxies and clusters of galaxies , gr requires the existence of large amounts of dark matter whose nature is still unknown .",
    "this is one of the unsolved problems in astrophysics .",
    "a number of alternative theories of gravity ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) have been proposed to solve such problems but none have been completely successful so far .",
    "one of these theories is massive conformal gravity ( mcg ) , which is a recently developed conformally invariant theory of gravity in which the gravitational action is the sum of the fourth order derivative weyl action with the second order derivative einstein - hilbert action conformally coupled to a scalar field .    the mcg gravitational potential , which is composed by an attractive newtonian potential and a repulsive yukawa potential , fits to galactic rotation curve data without dark matter @xcite . in addition , mcg is a renormalizable quantum theory of gravity and the mcg cosmology describes the current accelerating universe without dark energy @xcite . here",
    "we aim to test mcg with solar system observations . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we describe the classical mcg field equations , line element and geodesic equation . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we derive the linearized mcg gravitational field of a static spherically symmetric massive body . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we investigate the mcg deflection of light by the sun . in section [ sec5 ]",
    "we analyze the mcg radar echo delay .",
    "finally , conclusions are given in section [ sec6 ] .",
    "the mcg action is given by @xmath0 , \\label{1}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is a dimensionless constants , @xmath2 is a constant with dimensions of length , @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is the gravitational constant and @xmath5 is the speed of light in vacuum ) , @xmath6 is the weyl tensor , @xmath7 is a scalar field , @xmath8 is the riemann tensor , @xmath9 is the ricci tensor and @xmath10 is the scalar curvature .",
    "it is worth noting that the action ( [ 1 ] ) is invariant under the conformal transformations @xmath11 @xmath12 where @xmath13 is an arbitrary function of the spacetime coordinates .",
    "varying the action ( [ 1 ] ) with respect to @xmath14 and @xmath7 , we obtain the field equations @xmath15 = 0 , \\label{5}\\ ] ] @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the bach tensor , @xmath18 is the einstein tensor , and @xmath19 is the generally covariant dalembertian for a scalar field .    using the conformal invariance of the theory",
    ", we can impose the unitary gauge @xmath20 and the field equations ( [ 5 ] ) and ( [ 6 ] ) becomes @xmath21 @xmath22 in addition , in the unitary gauge , the mcg line element @xmath23 reduces to the general relativistic line element @xmath24 and the mcg geodesic equation @xmath25 reduces to the general relativistic geodesic equation @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the levi - civita connection .",
    "the full classical content of mcg can be obtained from ( [ 10 ] ) , ( [ 11 ] ) , ( [ 12 ] ) and ( [ 14 ] ) without loss of generality .",
    "one of the most important solar system test for a theory of gravitation is the perihelion precession of the planets .",
    "however , in order to find the correct mcg perihelion precession we need to solve the nonlinear field equations ( [ 10 ] ) and ( [ 11 ] ) , which is not an easy task to do .",
    "however , there are others solar system tests that can be calculated from the linear mcg field equations . in addition",
    ", it was recently been shown that the static spherically symmetric schwarzschild solution is unstable in mcg @xcite , which is a common feature of the schwarzschild black hole found in massive theories of gravity @xcite .",
    "thus it is prudent to work with the linear theory until all possible static spherically symmetric solutions to the nonlinear mcg field equations are found .    by imposing the weak - field approximation @xmath28 to ( [ 10 ] ) and (",
    "[ 11 ] ) , and neglecting terms of second order in @xmath29 , we obtain the mcg linearized field equations @xmath30 @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the linearized ricci tensor , and @xmath33 is the linearized scalar curvature , with @xmath34 .",
    "the linearized field equations ( [ 17 ] ) and ( [ 18 ] ) are invariant under the coordinate gauge transformation @xmath35 where @xmath36 is an arbitrary spacetime dependent vector field .",
    "we may impose the coordinate gauge condition @xmath37 which fixes the coordinate gauge freedom up to a residual coordinate gauge parameter satisfying @xmath38 .",
    "the combination of ( [ 17 ] ) , ( [ 18 ] ) and ( [ 22 ] ) then gives @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "considering a static ( time independent ) gravitational field , we find that ( [ 22 ] ) and ( [ 23 ] ) reduces to @xmath41 @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the laplacian operator and @xmath44 denotes spacial derivatives , with @xmath45 .",
    "the spherically symmetric solution of ( [ 25 ] ) reads @xmath46 where @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are constant matrices .    by imposing that @xmath29 goes to zero as @xmath51 , we set @xmath52 and ( [ 26 ] )",
    "becomes @xmath53 substituting ( [ 27 ] ) into ( [ 24 ] ) , we obtain @xmath54 which can hold for all values of @xmath55 only if @xmath56 @xmath57 the solutions of ( [ 29 ] ) and ( [ 30 ] ) are given by @xmath58 and @xmath59 , with all other components of @xmath48 and @xmath49 equal zero .",
    "it then follows that @xmath60 .",
    "the newtonian limit of mcg gives @xcite @xmath61 where @xmath62 \\label{32}\\ ] ] is the time - independent mcg gravitational potential of a particle of mass @xmath63 , with @xmath64 constant .",
    "hence the linearized mcg gravitational field of a static spherically symmetric mass distribution is described by the line element @xmath65 with @xmath66 given by ( [ 32 ] ) .",
    "one observable effect that can be obtained from the linear approximation of mcg is the deflection of light by the gravitational field of the sun . to describe such effect",
    "we must first find how light propagates in a gravitational field in mcg .    taking the linear approximation of the geodesic equation ( [ 14 ] ) and multiplying by @xmath67",
    ", we obtain @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the mass of a test particle and @xmath70 is the test particle four - velocity . by neglecting the terms of second order in @xmath29 , we can write ( [ 34 ] ) as @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the test particle momentum - energy four - vector . the form ( [ 35 ] ) of the geodesic equation",
    "can be used to describe the trajectories of both particles and light waves in mcg .",
    "the momentum - energy four - vector of a photon with frequency @xmath73 and wave vector @xmath74 is given by @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the planck constant and @xmath77 is the photon wave four - vector . substituting ( [ 36 ] ) into ( [ 35 ] ) , we obtain @xmath78    for a photon passing by a static spherically symmetric massive body along the @xmath79-axis with impact parameter @xmath80 ( see fig . [ f1 ] ) , we have @xmath81 @xmath82 the insertion of ( [ 39 ] ) and ( [ 40 ] ) into ( [ 38 ] ) then gives @xmath83 by substituting ( [ 33 ] ) into ( [ 41 ] ) , we arrive at @xmath84 so that the total change in @xmath85 is @xmath86 the deflection angle for a light ray passing by a static spherically symmetric mass distribution is therefore @xmath87 where the derivative is to be evaluated at the impact parameter of the light ray .    .",
    "]    inserting ( [ 32 ] ) into ( [ 44 ] ) , we obtain the mcg deflection angle @xmath88 dz   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & -\\frac{2gmb}{c^2(1+\\gamma)}\\int^{\\infty}_{-\\infty}\\left [   \\frac{(1+\\gamma e^{-\\mu\\sqrt{b^2+z^2}})}{(b^2+z^2)^{3/2}}+ \\frac{\\gamma \\mu   e^{-\\mu\\sqrt{b^2+z^2}}}{(b^2+z^2 ) } \\right ] dz , \\label{45}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is not solvable analytically and needs to be evaluated numerically",
    ". first we note that a good fit to flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies is obtained with the parameters @xcite @xmath89 in addition , we have @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "thus we just need the values of @xmath63 and @xmath80 to integrate ( [ 45 ] ) numerically . for a light ray deflected by the sun",
    "we must use @xmath92 and @xmath93 , so ( [ 45 ] ) gives @xmath94 which is just the general relativistic deflection angle of the sun .",
    "this value has been confirmed to within @xmath95 @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that while the mcg deflection angle ( [ 45 ] ) is equivalent to the general relativistic deflection angle @xmath96 in the solar system this is not the case on larger distance scales .",
    "just as the observed light deflection , the mcg light deflection due to the luminous matter in galaxies or clusters of galaxies is larger than the general relativistic light deflection .",
    "this indicates that it is likely that mcg does not need to appeal to dark matter to describe the light deflection on galactic scales .",
    "further study is necessary on this issue .",
    "let us consider a light signal that moves along a straight line ( parallel to the @xmath79-axis ) connecting two points @xmath97 and @xmath98 in the gravitational field of a static spherically symmetric massive body ( see fig .",
    "it follows from ( [ 33 ] ) and ( [ 41 ] ) that the change in @xmath99 along the straight line is given by @xmath100 substituting ( 32 ) into ( 48 ) and integrating , we find @xmath101 dz ' \\nonumber \\\\ & = &   -\\frac{2gm\\omega}{c^3(1+\\gamma)}\\int^{z}_{\\infty}\\left [ \\frac{(1+\\gamma   e^{-\\mu\\sqrt{b^2+z'^2}})z'}{(b^2+z'^2)^{3/2}}+ \\frac{\\gamma \\mu z '   e^{-\\mu\\sqrt{b^2+z'^2}}}{(b^2+z'^2 ) } \\right ] dz ' , \\nonumber \\\\ \\label{49}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we used @xmath102 .",
    "the substitution of ( [ 49 ] ) into the travel time for a light ray between @xmath97 and @xmath98 @xmath103 gives @xmath104 dz'dz , \\label{51}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which can only be evaluated numerically .",
    "the second term on the right side of ( [ 51 ] ) represents the mcg time delay produced by the gravitational field . for a light signal",
    "traveling between the earth ( at @xmath105 ) and mercury ( at @xmath106 ) on opposite sides of the sun , we set @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 , and obtain for the maximum possible time delay @xmath111 .",
    "it then follows that the mcg time delay for a light signal to go to mercury and return to earth is @xmath112 , which is consistent with the observed general relativistic value @xcite . at galactic scales , the mcg time delay in ( [ 51 ] ) is larger than the general relativistic time delay @xmath113 .",
    "however , since radar echo delay experiments on larger distance scales are not practical , we can not currently know which of the two time delays is completely consistent with observations .",
    "in the present paper , we have compared the predictions of the linear mcg with some results of solar system experiments . in particular",
    ", it was shown that the mcg deflection of light and radar echo delay are compatible with the observed results at the level of the solar system .",
    "additionally , besides describing well the rotation curves of galaxies , mcg predicts extra contributions to light deflection on galactic scales where discrepancies between general relativity and experiments exist .",
    "this means that the theory is a promising candidate to solve the dark matter problem .",
    "we will address this issue in the future ."
