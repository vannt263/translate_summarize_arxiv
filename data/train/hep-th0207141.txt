    "magnetic monopole soliton solutions arise in certain spontaneously broken gauge theories .",
    "after quantization , these give rise to magnetically charged particles that can be regarded as the counterparts of the electrically charged elementary particles of the theory .",
    "indeed , it is believed that in certain supersymmetric theories there is an exact duality symmetry @xcite relating these two classes of particles .    an interesting new feature arises if the unbroken gauge group contains a non - abelian subgroup .",
    "the massless gauge bosons of this subgroup transform nontrivially under the gauge group , and thus carry an `` electric charge '' .",
    "duality then predicts that these should have massless magnetically - charged counterparts .",
    "these can not be realized as isolated classical solutions .",
    "however , evidence for their existence has been found by analyzing certain multimonopole solutions @xcite .",
    "these solutions can be viewed as containing a `` cloud '' of non - abelian fields that surrounds one or more massive monopoles . evidently , this cloud is the manifestation of the massless monopole .    the previously known solutions of this type either have a single cloud that generally , although not always , corresponds to a single massless monopole , or else have two independent clouds . in this paper",
    ", we obtain a new class of solutions that has a much richer structure . by analyzing these",
    ", we are able to gain further insight into the nature of the massless monopoles .    to explain this in more detail , we need to establish some conventions .",
    "throughout , we consider a gauge theory with an adjoint representation higgs field @xmath2 and restrict ourselves to bps solutions @xcite obeying the bogomolny equation @xmath3 except in this introduction , we will assume that the fields have been rescaled so as to set the gauge coupling @xmath4 to unity",
    ".    both @xmath2 and the gauge potential @xmath5 can be regarded as elements of the lie algebra .",
    "recall that a basis for this algebra can be chosen to be a set of @xmath6 commuting generators @xmath7 that form the cartan subalgebra , together with raising and lowering operators @xmath8 associated with the roots . by an appropriate gauge transformation , the higgs expectation value can be chosen to be of the form @xmath9 if the @xmath6-component vector @xmath10 has nonzero inner products with all of the roots , the symmetry breaking is maximal and the unbroken symmetry group is the maximal torus @xmath11 . if , however , some roots are orthogonal to @xmath10 , then there is a non - abelian unbroken subgroup @xmath12 of rank @xmath13 .",
    "the roots of @xmath12 are precisely the roots that are orthogonal to @xmath14 and the symmetry is broken to @xmath15 .",
    "a basis for the root lattice is given by a set of @xmath6 simple roots @xmath16 .",
    "we require that these satisfy @xmath17 .",
    "this determines the set uniquely in the case of maximal symmetry breaking , but only up to a weyl transformation when there is nonmaximal breaking .    at large distances ,",
    "the magnetic field must commute with the higgs field .",
    "hence , in a direction where the asymptotic higgs field is of the form of eq .",
    "( [ hdef ] ) , the magnetic field can be put in the form @xmath18 where the magnetic charge @xmath19 is an element of the cartan sub - algebra .",
    "the topological quantization condition requires that @xcite @xmath20 with the @xmath21 all being integers ; for self - dual bps solutions these will all be positive .    in the case of maximal symmetry breaking , the simple roots can be used to construct a set of @xmath6 fundamental monopoles .",
    "these are obtained by embedding the unit su(2 ) monopole ( appropriately rescaled ) in the su(2 ) subgroup associated with each of the @xmath16 .",
    "the @xmath16-monopole thus defined has mass @xmath22 and the radius of its core region is roughly @xmath23 .",
    "it carries one unit of the topological charge @xmath21 , while the remaining @xmath24 all vanish .",
    "zero - mode analysis shows that this solution has four zero modes , requiring the introduction of four collective coordinates .",
    "three of these specify the position of the monopole , while the fourth is a u(1 ) phase ; dyonic solutions can be obtained by allowing this phase to become time - dependent .",
    "an arbitrary static bps solution can be interpreted as being composed of a collection of these fundamental monopoles , with the @xmath21 specifying the number of each type @xcite . in particular , the energy is the sum of the component masses while the number of zero modes is @xmath25 .",
    "the case of non - abelian symmetry breaking can be obtained by varying the higgs expectation value so that @xmath10 is orthogonal to some of the @xmath16 ; we will often write @xmath26 to indicate the latter .",
    "the bps mass formula implies that the fundamental monopoles corresponding to the @xmath26 should be massless .",
    "actually , there is no classical solution corresponding to these monopoles , since the prescription for embedding the su(2 ) monopole gives a trivial vacuum solution in this limit .",
    "nevertheless , the formulas for the mass and counting of zero modes in terms of the @xmath21 remain valid , suggesting that the interpretation of higher charged solutions in terms of component fundamental monopoles should be retained @xcite .",
    "some insight can be obtained by considering specific examples .",
    "the simplest @xcite arises in the context of so(5 ) broken to su(2)@xmath27u(1 ) .",
    "there are two species of fundamental monopoles , one massive and one massless . the solutions in which we are interested contain one of each ; we will refer to it as a ( 1,[1 ] ) solution , with the square brackets indicating that the corresponding monopole is massless . because these solutions turn out to be spherically symmetric , the bps equations can be reduced to a set of ordinary differential equations that can be explicitly solved in terms of rational and hyperbolic functions . examining the solutions ,",
    "one finds a massive core of fixed size that is surrounded by a spherical cloud of radius @xmath28 . inside the cloud",
    "there is a coulomb magnetic field , with both abelian and non - abelian components , that corresponds to the magnetic charge of the massive fundamental monopole .",
    "outside the cloud , the non - abelian components of the magnetic field fall off as @xmath29 , leaving the purely abelian coulomb field appropriate to the sum of the two component monopoles .",
    "the energy of the solution is independent of the cloud radius @xmath28 , which can take on any positive real value .    in these solutions ,",
    "the massive monopole is evident and has a well defined position .",
    "the massless monopole is clearly associated with the cloud , but it is less clear how to define its position . to illustrate this , consider an arbitrary ( 1,1 ) solution in the theory with so(5 ) maximally broken to u(1)@xmath27u(1 ) .",
    "if the direction of the higgs expectation value is varied continuously until the second fundamental monopole becomes massless , this solution approaches one of the ( 1,[1 ] ) solutions .",
    "the separation of the massive monopoles in the initial solution becomes the cloud parameter in the final solution .",
    "however , the direction of the separation vector has no effect on the final solution .",
    "more complex solutions have been studied with the aid of the nahm construction , which we describe below .",
    "two examples , both containing one massless and two massive monopoles , will play an important role in our considerations .",
    "one is the ( 1,[1],1 ) solution @xcite for the case of su(4 ) broken to u(1)@xmath27su(2)@xmath27u(1 ) , and the other is the ( 2,[1 ] ) dancer solution @xcite for su(3 ) broken to su(2)@xmath27u(1 ) . in both cases , the massless monopole is manifested as a cloud that encloses both of the massive monopoles . inside the cloud , one finds the abelian and non - abelian coulomb magnetic fields appropriate to the charges and positions of the massive monopoles . outside the cloud only the abelian component survives . as in the so(5 ) example , the cloud is parameterized by a single collective coordinate that determines its size .",
    "[ an sp(4 ) solution with one massless and two massive monopoles is described in ref .",
    "@xcite . ]    in order to understand better the nature of these clouds , it would be helpful to have some examples of solutions with two or more distinct clouds , or at least with clouds that had more structure .",
    "it might be expected that such solutions could be obtained simply by adding additional massless monopoles .",
    "this is not necessarily so .",
    "for example , the ( 1,[1],1 ) solutions in su(4 ) can be readily generalized @xcite to @xmath30 , \\dots , [ 1],1)$ ] solutions for su(@xmath31 ) broken to u(1)@xmath27su(@xmath32)@xmath27u(1 ) .",
    "although the generalized solutions have @xmath33 massless monopoles , the spacetime fields display only a single one - parameter ellipsoidal cloud , no matter what the value of @xmath31 .",
    "in fact , the solutions are simply embeddings of the su(4 ) solution into the larger group .",
    "one example with two non - abelian clouds is the @xmath34,2,[1])$ ] solution in su(4 ) broken to u(1)@xmath27su(@xmath32)@xmath27u(1 ) @xcite .",
    "however , the two clouds do not interact directly and the structure is no richer than the ( 2,[1 ] ) dancer solution .    a more promising choice , on which we will focus in this paper , is the family of @xmath35 , \\dots , [ 2],2)$ ] solutions for su(@xmath31 ) broken to u(1)@xmath27su(@xmath32)@xmath27u(1 ) .",
    "for certain special choices of parameters , these essentially reduce to a pair of widely separated @xmath30 , \\dots , [ 1],1)$ ] solutions . in general , however , these solutions are considerably more complex . at the same time , they are reasonably tractable .",
    "let us expand upon this last point .",
    "except for a few symmetric solutions , such as the su(2 ) unit monopole and the so(5 ) solution @xmath30)$ ] solution discussed above , the bogomolny equation is too difficult to solve directly .",
    "instead , it is easier to use a construction due to nahm @xcite .",
    "this nahm construction has three distinct steps . in the first",
    ", one solves the nahm equation , which is a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations for a set of matrices @xmath36 . these nahm data ,",
    "as they are called , then specify a linear differential equation , the construction equation .",
    "finally , the spacetime fields are obtained by integration of quantities that are bilinear in the solutions of the construction equations .",
    "this construction can be carried out explicitly for both the @xmath30,1)$ ] su(4 ) solution noted above and the analogous @xmath37 solution in the maximally broken theory @xcite .",
    "for the @xmath38)$ ] dancer solution , the nahm equation can be solved , yielding data that are expressed in terms of elliptic functions . except for special cases , however ,",
    "the resulting construction equation can only be solved asymptotically , allowing one to obtain approximations to the spacetime fields that are valid far from the massive monopole cores .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we give an overview of the nahm construction and establish some conventions .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "iii , we discuss the parameters entering the various solutions we will be considering .",
    "we also describe how to solve the nahm equation to obtain the data for the su(@xmath31 ) @xmath30 , \\dots , [ 1],1)$ ] solution , the su(3 ) dancer solution , and , finally , the @xmath35 , \\dots , [ 2],2)$ ] solutions that will be our main focus . in sec .",

    ", we show how the @xmath30 , \\dots , [ 1],1)$ ] solutions can be easily recovered . for the case",
    "@xmath42 , which is our primary interest , we need some special limits of the dancer solution ; these are described in sec .",

    "vi , we use these dancer results in the construction of sec .",

    "we describe the nature of the clouds in each . in sec .",
    "vii we use these solutions to abstract some general rules describing how clouds form about massive monopoles .",
    "this clarifies the relationship between clouds and massless monopoles . finally , in sec .",
    "viii , we summarize our results and add some concluding remarks .",
    "the bogomolny equation is reciprocal to the nahm equation .",
    "this means that the solutions of the bogomolny equation may be constructed from the solutions of the nahm equation and visa versa .",
    "furthermore , the moduli space of solutions to the bogomolny equation is isometric to the moduli space of solutions to the nahm equations .",
    "the reciprocal relationship is similar to the relationship between the self - dual yang - mills equations and the adhm data @xcite .",
    "the nahm equation is an equation for a quadruple of hermitian matrix functions of a single variable @xmath44 : @xmath45=-\\frac{i}{2}\\epsilon_{ijk}[t_j , t_k].\\ ] ] solutions of the nahm equations are called nahm data .",
    "the size of the matrices and the boundary conditions that they satisfy determine the monopole charge in the reciprocal bogomolny problem . for an @xmath43 solution with @xmath46 monopoles of mass @xmath47 ,",
    "the variable @xmath44 lies in the interval @xmath48 and the data are @xmath49 matrices .",
    "the matrices @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are required to have simple poles at @xmath53 , while @xmath54 must be finite at these end points . by expanding @xmath55 near @xmath53 and substituting back into the nahm equations ,",
    "it is easy to see that the matrix residues @xmath56 satisfy the @xmath43 commutation relations @xmath57=i\\epsilon_{ijk}r^\\pm_k.\\ ] ] it is required as a boundary condition that the matrix residues form an irreducible @xmath46-dimensional representation of @xmath43 .",
    "the case @xmath58 is special , because the one - dimensional representation of @xmath43 is trivial and in fact , for @xmath58 there are no poles at the end points .",
    "the role played by the boundary condition will become clear shortly , when we discuss the construction of monopole fields . before doing this ,",
    "it is useful to examine the symmetry groups acting on the nahm data .",
    "there is an @xmath59 group action on the data given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 is an @xmath59 function of @xmath44 .",
    "this action does not affect the monopole fields that are constructed from the nahm data .",
    "this action is usually referred to as the gauge action . in the @xmath43 case ,",
    "this action is customarily fixed by requiring @xmath62 and specifying the matrix residues .",
    "there are two further group actions .",
    "there is an @xmath43 action which rotates @xmath63 as a three - vector : @xmath64 and there is a @xmath65 action which translates the traces : @xmath66 these actions correspond to rotation and translation of the monopole fields themselves . of course",
    ", if the gauge has been fixed by specifying the residues then the rotation action must include a compensating gauge transformation .",
    "the spacetime gauge and higgs fields are obtained from the nahm data by first solving the construction equation , @xmath67 for the @xmath68-vector function @xmath69 , which we will refer to as the construction data .",
    "( to simplify our notation , we will often not explicitly show the @xmath70 dependence of @xmath69 . ) an inner product between any two such vector functions @xmath69 and @xmath71 is given by @xmath72 with this inner product , there are precisely two linearly independent normalizable solutions to eq .",
    "( [ coeqn ] ) .",
    "we choose these to be orthonormal .",
    "it is easy to see why there are only two solutions . near @xmath73 @xmath74\\ ] ] where @xmath75 are irreducible @xmath49 representation matrices for @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath76 has two eigenvalues : @xmath77 with degeneracy @xmath41 and @xmath78 with degeneracy @xmath79 .",
    "this can be shown by choosing an explicit basis and calculating directly . however , it is useful to examine the elegant group theoretical argument , familiar from the addition of angular momenta , that is given in @xcite .",
    "if @xmath75 is a representation of @xmath43 , then @xmath80 is the casimir operator . for the @xmath46-dimensional irreducible representation",
    ", this is @xmath81 .",
    "it is possible to rewrite @xmath76 in terms of casimir operators . because @xmath82 , @xmath83 or , @xmath84 thus , a vector in @xmath85 is an eigenvector of @xmath76 with eigenvalue @xmath77 and a vector in @xmath86 is an eigenvector with eigenvalue @xmath78 .    in order to be normalizable",
    ", @xmath69 must lie in the eigenspace with eigenvalue @xmath77 and so it must be perpendicular to the @xmath79 vectors in @xmath85 .",
    "this gives @xmath79 conditions .",
    "the pole at @xmath87 gives another @xmath79 conditions in the same way , and so there are two normalizable solutions .",
    "if @xmath88 and @xmath89 are an orthonormal basis for these solutions , then the fields are given by @xmath90    these fields can be shown to satisfy the bogomolny equations .",
    "this follows from the fact that the nahm equations imply that @xmath91 commutes with @xmath92 . without dwelling too much on the details , which can be found in @xcite , the argument runs as follows . by explicit calculation @xmath93\\partial_kv_b(s')\\,ds\\,ds ' } } \\ , .\\ ] ] now , the operator @xmath94\\,ds'$ ] is a projection operator that projects onto the null space of @xmath95 .",
    "this means that it can be replaced by the projection operator @xmath96 and so @xmath97 the construction equation implies that @xmath98 .",
    "hence , using @xmath99=0 $ ] , we obtain @xmath100 this is half of the argument .",
    "the other half of the argument shows that @xmath101 also equals the right hand side of the above equation .",
    "this half of the argument is very similar to the one just given , the main difference is that it uses @xmath102 as well as @xmath103 .",
    "it is also useful to describe how the matrix size determines the monopole charge .",
    "we will follow the proof given in @xcite . for large @xmath6 , @xmath95",
    "is approximated by @xmath104 @xmath105 differs from @xmath95 in two ways .",
    "firstly , the nahm data have been approximated by their behavior near the pole .",
    "it can be shown that this affects the calculation of @xmath2 at order @xmath106 .",
    "the other difference is that the matrix residues are assumed to be the same at each end .",
    "in fact , while they are both required to form the same representation , they could differ by a unitary conjugation .",
    "this subtlety is not important since it corresponds to an @xmath44-dependent unitary transformation of @xmath69 and does not affect the fields .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath107 are independent of direction and depend only on @xmath6 .",
    "in fact , the large-@xmath6 fields calculated using @xmath108 are spherically symmetric and so we can take @xmath109 .",
    "this means that @xmath110 commutes with @xmath111 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath112 has a unique eigenvector of eigenvalue @xmath46 and another of eigenvalue @xmath113 lying in the @xmath114 of @xmath115 .",
    "these eigenvalues are exceptional , in that all the other eigenspaces are two - dimensional , being spanned by an eigenvector from @xmath85 and an eigenvector from @xmath86 . since the @xmath116 eigenvectors are in @xmath85 , we know how they are acted on by @xmath76 : both of them have eigenvalue @xmath117 . since @xmath118 , we also know how they are acted on by @xmath119 : they have eigenvalues @xmath6 and @xmath120 .",
    "let us denote the two eigenvectors @xmath121 and @xmath122 respectively .",
    "now , if we substitute @xmath123 into the approximate construction equation @xmath124 , we get @xmath125 which is solved by @xmath126 because @xmath127 are pointwise orthogonal , we need only consider the diagonal components of @xmath128 . for large @xmath6 ,",
    "the exponential in @xmath129 means that the value of any integral of a polynomial times @xmath130 is dominated by the value of the integrand near @xmath131 .",
    "this allow us to approximate @xmath132 and @xmath133 we can then integrate by parts and show that @xmath134 @xmath135 works the same way , establishing the relation between the charge and the size of the nahm matrices .",
    "we will use similar techniques below to calculate approximate monopole fields .",
    "the construction is remarkably easy to implement in the case of a single su(2 ) monopole , where it even predates the nahm equation @xcite . for @xmath58",
    "the nahm matrices reduce to numerical functions of @xmath44 .",
    "the nahm equations imply that these must be constants , which turn out to give the position of the monopole . by translational invariance ,",
    "this can be taken to be the origin .",
    "thus @xmath136 where the @xmath137 are orthonormal and the normalization factor @xmath138^{-1/2 } \\label{normalizationfactor}\\ ] ] is obtained by noting that @xmath139 because @xmath140 the higgs field is @xmath141 the usual `` hedgehog gauge '' form of the one - monopole higgs field is obtained by taking @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "another possibility is @xmath144 where the two - component spinors @xmath145 which are eigenvectors of @xmath146 with eigenvalues @xmath147 , satisfy @xmath148 , @xmath149 . with this choice ,",
    "the higgs field is everywhere proportional to @xmath150 .",
    "the singularity in @xmath151 along the positive @xmath152-axis is the dirac string that appears whenever a monopole solution is written with a uniform higgs field direction .      for @xmath43 monopoles , the boundary values of @xmath44",
    "are given by the two eigenvalues @xmath153 of the asymptotic higgs field @xmath154 .",
    "in the case of @xmath155 monopoles , the asymptotic higgs field has more than two eigenvalues and the nahm data are matrix functions over a subdivided interval defined by the eigenvalues . in order to describe this , it is convenient to choose a particular basis for the cartan generators",
    ". we choose diagonal generators @xmath7 so that @xmath156 where @xmath157 . in the case of maximal symmetry breaking , none of these eigenvalues are equal and so all the inequalities are strict .",
    "the magnetic charge is @xmath158    with this basis of cartan generators , the @xmath159th fundamental monopole , with @xmath160 , is obtained by embedding an appropriately rescaled @xmath43 monopole solution in the @xmath161 block at the intersection of the @xmath162th and @xmath163th rows and columns .",
    "this fundamental monopole then has mass @xmath164 .    in the nahm construction ,",

    "as @xmath154 approaches a value with an enlarged symmetry group , the masses of some of the elementary bosons decrease , eventually vanishing in the limit where the symmetry becomes non - abelian .",

    ".    however , the situation can be different if the configuration contains a monopole that remains massive in the non - abelian limit . if the fields in the massive core transform under the non - abelian symmetry , some of the massless gauge fields acquire an effective mass near the massive core .",

    "there are three possible situations .",
    "one possibility is that the massive and massless monopoles lie in mutually commuting subgroups .",
    "the massive monopole then has no effect on the massless monopole , and the behavior described in the previous paragraph is unchanged .",
    "another possibility is that the addition of the massless monopole to the massive monopole corresponds to a gauge transformation of the massive monopole , in which case no gauge - invariant evidence of the massless monopole survives in the non - abelian limit .",
    "the most interesting case is when neither of these holds .",
    "the massless monopole core then expands only until it reaches the massive monopole , resulting in a cloud whose radius is equal to the original intermonopole separation .",
    "a similar pattern should be expected when several massive monopoles are present . a massless monopole with non - abelian charge",
    "@xmath493 should be able to form a finite size cloud enclosing a collection of monopoles with total charge @xmath533 only if ( 1 ) @xmath493 does not lie in the subgroup that leaves @xmath533 invariant and ( 2 ) @xmath747 is not gauge - equivalent to @xmath533 .",

    "( [ fourthqna ] ) , this corresponds to having the clouds from the @xmath728- , the @xmath730- , and the @xmath743-monopoles all coincident , with the fourth , @xmath744 , cloud at a ( possibly much larger ) radius @xmath560 .    for su(4 ) broken to u(1)@xmath27su(2)@xmath27u(1 ) , a solution containing @xmath782 @xmath319-monopoles and @xmath783 @xmath320-monopoles has vanishing su(2 ) magnetic charge , and thus no asymptotic non - abelian coulomb field , if there are exactly @xmath784 massless @xmath785-monopoles .",
    "however , this tells us little about the magnetic field at finite distances . in particular",
    ", we would like to know whether the massive monopoles are `` paired up '' to form su(2)-neutral combinations composed of two massive monopoles enclosed by a single massless monopole cloud .",

    "the explicit determination of such metrics is a difficult task .",
    "however , one might hope that relation between the dancer nahm data and the @xmath35,\\dots,[2],2)$ ] nahm data could be exploited to allow a construction of the moduli space metric in terms of the dancer metric @xcite .",
    "secondly , one would like to understand better the quantum theory of monopoles with non - abelian charges , and in particular the complex interplay of the non - abelian electric and magnetic charges @xcite .",
