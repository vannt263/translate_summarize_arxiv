    "ferromagnetic heusler and semi - heusler alloys are materials with interesting physical properties .",
    "we refer the reader to a comprehensive recent review.@xcite several of them , due to their halfmetallic character , structural similarity with semiconductors , curie temperatures above the room temperature , full spin polarization at the fermi energy , and low magnetization damping are materials with potential in technological applications .",
    "the typical examples of such halfmetallic alloys are the semi - heusler nimnsb alloys , the full heusler alloy co@xmath1fega or mn@xmath1coal with the inverse heusler structure .",
    "halfmetallic heusler alloys are usually ferromagnets , but there are also antiferromagnetic ( afm ) alloys which can be potential materials for the so - called antiferromagnetic spintronics.@xcite recently the anisotropic magnetoresistance of the afm - ferh alloy was studied both experimentally and theoretically.@xcite the antiferromagnetism of cumnsb heusler alloys is well established , @xcite but its low critical nel temperature limits practical applications as contrasted with the above - mentioned afm ferh alloys . a new family of cumnx alloys , where x are elements of the fifth group with potentially higher critical temperature , was proposed recently and studied theoretically .",
    "a promising candidate seems to be the layered cumnas alloy with a predicted nel temperature in the range of room temperatures.@xcite    the halfmetallic cumnsb , the first afm mn - based member of heusler and semi - heusler alloy family , therefore attracted the theoretical interest in the past , in particular as concerns its magnetic structure .",
    "a pilot first - principles study of its magnetic properties was the subject of ref .  .",
    "authors of this paper have compared the total energies of the non - magnetic , ferromagnetic ( fm ) , and the afm phases of cumnsb at the experimental volume .",
    "they found , in agreement with the experiment , that the ground state is the afm one .",
    "the total energy of the fm phase is higher while the total energy of the non - magnetic phase was found to be significantly above energies of the afm and fm phases .",
    "the afm phase was specifically chosen to be the afm111 one , with the alternating ( 111)-planes of mn atoms with aligned spins , as known from experimental neutron scattering studies . @xcite",
    "the fact that the theoretical situation can be more complex was indicated earlier in the study of ( cu , ni)mnsb random alloys .",
    "@xcite the emphasis there was put on the explanation of unusual concentration dependence of magnetic moments and residual resistivities , namely , the dramatic change of the slope of the above concentration dependencies for the cu - content of 70 - 75% .",
    "however , different ab initio calculations found that the total energy of the ideal cumnsb afm100 structure is lower than the afm111 phase detected experimentally .",
    "this result , obtained by the tight - binding linear muffin - tin orbital ( tb - lmto ) method@xcite was also confirmed by our full - potential calculations .",
    "defects are very common in heusler alloys and their type and amount depend strongly on the sample preparation and annealing procedure .",
    "defects either preserve ( swaps ) stoichiometric composition or violate it ( impurities ) . in the case of cumnsb alloys , real experimental samples for which the magnetic structure was studied show relatively large residual resistivities of order 50 @xmath2 cm ( see , e.g. , reference in ref .  ) , which clearly indicates the presence of a non - negligible sample disorder .",
    "it is thus interesting to investigate how the presence of impurities will influence the magnetic stability of cumnsb .",
    "a systematic study of formation energies of possible stoichiometric ( swaps ) and non - stoichiometric ( antisite ) defects in a closely related nimnsb alloy was the subject of ref .",
    ". we will adapt this approach to the case of cumnsb to identify the most probable defects according to their formation energies .",
    "a systematic estimate of formation energies of all possible defects is , however , beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we limit ourselves to the most probable ones discussed in experiments @xcite or to those chosen by the analogy with the nimnsb case @xcite and perform calculations in the framework of the tb - lmto approach combined with the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) .",
    "the most probable defects seem to be mn atoms on the cu - sublattice , mn@xmath3 , cu atoms on the mn - sublattice , cu@xmath4 , mn atoms at interstitial sites in the non - stoichiometric case , and the cu@xmath5mn swaps for the stoichiometric cumnsb .",
    "we study the effect of disorder on the magnetic structure due to the defects by two independent approaches : ( i ) the supercell approach employing the full - potential vienna ab - initio simulation package ( vasp ) @xcite , and ( ii ) the heisenberg model whose parameters were determined by the tb - lmto - cpa approach @xcite in which the effect of randomness is included in the framework of cpa .",
    "a main problem with supercell approach is the necessity to consider all probable afm phases in the search for the ground state and also the large number of possible configurations which should be considered to simulate defect concentration dependencies .",
    "the heisenberg model which describes directly the relevant magnetic part of total energy and does not assume any specific magnetic order as it starts from a completely random moment arrangement , can roughly indicate possible candidates .",
    "in this way we have extended the search also to the afm40 phase ( the a@xmath6b@xmath6-type).@xcite the final search is then done using the supercell vasp approach due to its accuracy .",
    "another reason for the parallel study using the supercell and heisenberg model is the fact that both methods represent limiting models of disordered systems . while the cpa provides a good description of completely disordered alloys neglecting the local environment or short - range order effects .",
    "the supercell approach , on the contrary , neglects the randomness of defects .",
    "while both approaches should agree reasonably well in the case of defects of one type ( mn@xmath3-antisites or mn - interstitials ) , in the case of two defects ( cu@xmath5mn swaps ) both models are very different .",
    "there is no correlation between positions of mn@xmath3- and cu@xmath4-antisites in the cpa while in the supercell approach we assume their fully correlated positions in the whole crystal ( practically the nearest - neighbor positions to have computationally feasible sizes of supercells ) .",
    "clearly , one thus can expect largest differences between both models for this case .",
    "the supercell approach also allows to check the robustness of results with respect to possible lattice relaxations which are neglected in the cpa .",
    "the real alloy is thus somewhere between these two limits .",
    "the important characteristics of any magnetic system are magnetic , or exchange interactions among magnetic moments which enter the definition of the heisenberg model . in the present case , these interactions are predominantly among mn - moments .",
    "they are constructed using the first - principles lichtenstein mapping procedure @xcite adapted to the tb - lmto - cpa approach . @xcite it should be noted that this procedure allows to estimate directly interactions among moments at any pair of sites , and , in particular , also as a function of varying defect concentrations .",
    "this is very difficult in the supercell case .",
    "it is important to note that in the present case the exchange integrals are determined from the reference disordered local moment ( dlm ) @xcite state which describes material above the critical temperature ( the paramagnetic state ) : no specific magnetic configuration is thus used in their construction , as emphasized above .",
    "the most important result of the present study is the finding that already a low concentration of magnetic defects is able to change the system total energy in favor of the afm111 phase so that defects can stabilize the afm111 ground state of cumnsb .",
    "finally , we have also found that a proper treatment of electron correlations in narrow mn @xmath7-bands @xcite is important and also helps to stabilize the afm111 phase .",
    "the ideal cumnsb has a @xmath8 crystal structure which can be represented by four fcc - type sublattices cu - mn - es - sb shifted along the [ 111]-direction of the parent fcc - lattice consecutively by the distance @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the lattice constant and the symbol es denotes the empty sublattice ( interstitial sites ) .",
    "the afm111/afm100 magnetic structures consist of alternating [ 111]/[100 ] planes of mn atoms with opposite spins which have doubled unit size as compared to the original @xmath8 lattice . finally , the afm40 magnetic structure is a tetragonal structure with alternating double layers of opposite spins along the [ 210]-direction ( a@xmath1b@xmath1-lattice ) .",
    "@xcite in our calculations we use the experimental lattice constant @xmath11    @xcite and neglect small volume changes due to defects .",
    "two different electronic structure methods were used to determine the total energy of cumnsb , both ideal and with specific defects , namely , the supercell vasp and tb - lmto - cpa methods .",
    "their technical details are summarized below .",
    "the supercell vasp calculations were performed using the projector augmented wave scheme@xcite with different exchange correlation potentials .",
    "only one defect in the unit cell is used for an antisite mn or cu atom or for mn in interstitial position , while two nearest neighbor mn- and cu - antisite defects are used to describe the cu@xmath5mn swap .",
    "the magnetic supercell containing 12 atoms simulates an ideal crystal while supercells containing 24 , 48 , 96 and for some defects also 192 atoms simulate disordered alloys with defect concentrations of 12.5% , 6.25% , 3.13% and 1.56% , respectively .",
    "it should be noted that the presence of defects leads to a small finite total magnetic moment as contrasted with the exactly zero magnetic moment in the cpa method .",
    "the brillouin zone was sampled by @xmath12 k - points for the tetragonal unit cell with 24 atoms , and grids with correspondingly smaller number of sampling points were used for larger supercells .",
    "identical large unit cell was used for afm100 , afm111 and afm40 magnetic structures for every defect concentration .",
    "the total energy error was 0.05 mev ( per supercell ) , the difference between input and output charge densities in the final iteration of selfconsistent iterations was better than 0.1 me bohr@xmath13 . for selected configurations we also optimized the local geometry by atomic force minimization .",
    "we found that local distortions have only weak effect on the total energy differences for small defect concentrations , therefore the most presented results are shown for unrelaxed structures .",
    "no lattice constant changes due to defects are considered .    in the tb - lmto - cpa approach the effects of substitutional as well as magnetic disorders",
    "are described by the cpa neglecting possible lattice relaxations , local environment and clustering ( short range order ) effects .",
    "@xcite in the disordered case we have used a simple screened impurity model @xcite to improve the treatment of alloy electrostatics . the @xmath14-basis and vosko - wilk - nusair exchange correlation potential @xcite were used while integration over the full brillouin zone was done using about 2000 k - vectors .",
    "the same wigner - seitz radii were used for all constituent atoms including the empty spheres that fulfill interstitial sites .",
    "calculated total energies in the dlm state were used to estimate the formation energies of possible defects , swaps for the stoichiometric cumnsb and impurities for the non - stoichiometric one .",
    "the selfconsistent dlm potentials were also used to estimate exchange interactions and to construct the heisenberg hamiltonian .    in both approaches we have optionally included the effect of electron correlations in narrow mn - subbands in the framework of the lda+u method .",
    "@xcite we employ the fully localized limit and make replacement @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are , respectively , coulomb repulsion and exchange constants .",
    "we used @xmath18 ry which is similar to the value obtained in ref .   for a closely related nimnsb heusler alloy using the constrained random - phase approximation .",
    "the magnetic part of total energy is estimated from the classical heisenberg hamiltonian @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 are site indices , @xmath21 is the unit vector pointing along the direction of the local magnetic moment at site @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the exchange integral between sites @xmath22 and @xmath24 .",
    "the exchange integrals , by construction , contain the atom magnetic moments , their positive ( negative ) values being indicative of ferromagnetic ( antiferromagnetic ) coupling .",
    "it should be noted that for an evaluation of the exchange integrals we assume the dlm reference state in which possible small local moments on cu , sb , or interstitial sites vanish .",
    "the only non - zero exchange integrals are thus among mn atoms .",
    "the dlm state assumes no prescribed magnetic order in the alloy , just the existence of local magnetic moments on mn - atoms and conclusions drawn from it are thus very general .",
    "the dlm state can be naturally implemented in the framework of the tb - lmto - cpa .",
    "@xcite    in the case of random alloys the exchange interactions are usually approximated by the expression @xmath25 in which @xmath26 are occupation indices ( @xmath27 if site @xmath22 is occupied by the atom of type @xmath28 and @xmath29 otherwise ) .    in the general case",
    "one should consider the dependence of vectors @xmath21 on the type of atom at the site @xmath22 . the situation is simpler in the present case , because on each sublattice there is at most one type of magnetic atom .",
    "consequently , the configurationally averaged energy is given by @xmath30 note that @xmath31 for @xmath32 and the occupation indices belonging to different sites @xmath22 and @xmath24 average independently , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 are ( local ) concentrations . the averaged total energy @xmath35 per elementary cell ,",
    "e.g. , that corresponding to the specific magnetic phase , is then given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 are effective exchange interactions .",
    "calculated energies can be compared with those obtained from the corresponding total energy calculations based on the supercell vasp approach .    in the present approach",
    "we assume that magnetic moments have fixed size but allow their different spin directions when searching for the magnetic ground state .",
    "it should be noted that there exists a more general approach , the magnetic cluster expansion method @xcite , in which also the size of moments is a variational parameter . on the other hand , for an alloy with very rigid magnetic moments like ,",
    "e.g. , cumnsb with mn - moments , the present simpler approach is reasonable unless higher - order magnetic interactions become important .",
    "we shall start our discussion by investigating possible magnetic phases based on the heisenberg model .",
    "the easiest way of doing so is to calculate the lattice fourier transform @xmath38 of exchange integrals ( [ hh2 ] ) which enter the definition of the corresponding heisenberg hamiltonian ( [ hh1 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath38 describes formally possible spin spirals on a given lattice .",
    "we shall employ two models : ( i ) in the first one leading interactions are obtained from the dlm phase which assumes no magnetic order , and ( ii ) two effective interactions are estimated from total energies of the fm , afm100 , and afm111 phases calculated in the vasp .",
    "these interactions represent a fit of the three above energies onto the heisenberg model and in some sense they include all interactions as determined above by first - principles mapping from the dlm phase . in both cases",
    "we used the lda+u approach .",
    "the values are : @xmath39= @xmath40  mry for the dlm case , and @xmath39= @xmath41  mry for the vasp .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] in which , due to the minus sign in ( [ hh1 ] ) , the higher values correspond to lower energies and vice versa .",
    "energies of such spin spirals correspond to specific magnetic phases , e.g. , the values at @xmath42 = @xmath43 , x , l , and w relate to the fm , afm100 , afm111 , and afm40 phases , respectively .",
    "a general magnetic phase diagram of heusler alloys in the @xmath39-plane was determined in ref .  .",
    "in agreement with its predictions , we have the afm100 ground state for the dlm case , but the amf40 ground state for the vasp , although the afm100 phase has almost identical energy .",
    "both models thus predict that the afm111 phase is not a ground state for the ideal cumnsb .",
    "they also suggest that the afm111 , afm100 , and afm40 are good candidates for the ground state ( the fm phase can be excluded ) .",

    "we have therefore investigated from first principles the ground state of selected magnetic phases of cumnsb alloy with defects using the supercell vasp total energy calculation and the model heisenberg hamiltonian derived from the paramagnetic dlm state with no prescribed magnetic configuration .",
    "the heisenberg hamiltonian , determined from the paramagnetic state , was used to find possible candidates for the magnetic ground state . in all cases",
    "we used the lda+u approach to treat approximately the effect of electron correlations in narrow mn @xmath7-bands .",
    "the main conclusions are : ( i ) the magnetic ground state of ideal cumnsb crystal is not the afm111 phase ; ( ii ) the experimentally observed afm111 phase is the ground state of cumnsb samples with mn defects which occupy the nearest neighbor sites of the native mn sublattice , namely , mn - antisites on cu lattice , and mn - interstitials ; ( iii ) the crossover to the afm111 phase is due to the very strong afm - like intersublattice interactions among the nn mn - moments with distances shorter than those on the native mn lattice .",
    "the weakening of the ferromagnetic 2nd nn interactions on the native mn - lattice due to defects also helps to stabilize the afm111 phase ; ( iv ) the supercell approach gives critical concentrations for the crossover to afm111 state below 3% for defects mentioned above while the heisenberg model approach predicts the values at least two times larger ; and ( v ) neutron diffraction experiment confirms the existence of low defect concentrations of about 2% .",
    "we conclude that the experimentally observed afm111 phase is stabilized by defects , in particular those that form the nn pairs with mn atoms on the native mn sublattice ( mn antisites on cu , mn interstitials , and possibly also cu@xmath5mn swaps ) .",
