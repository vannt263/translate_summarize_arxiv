    "molecular quasi two - dimensional organic conductors based on bedt - ttf ( where bedt - ttf stands for bisethylenedithio - tetrathiafulvalene ) and its derivatives are known to be excellent model objects to study the effects of electron - electron correlations and charge ordering of different nature in two dimensional ( 2d ) systems.@xcite according to theoretical studies,@xcite the electronic parameters which are crucial for the metallic properties and formation of charge ordering ( co ) are the filling of the conduction band and the size of the electronic correlation energy compared to the width of conductance band or transfer integrals . in bedt - ttf - based compounds these physical parameters can be tuned chemically by changing the structure or / and chemical composition of the crystals . the width of the conduction band increases with the orbital overlap of neighboring molecules .",
    "the filling of the conduction band depends upon both the anionic charge and upon the ratio of cations and anions .",
    "recently a large effort has been devoted to systematically control the band filling and to study its influence on the physical properties.@xcite however , most of 2d organic conductors have quarter - filled bands ( charge @xmath5 per molecule ) , or effectively half - filled bands ( @xmath6 per dimer ) for dimerized structure .",
    "the isostructural family @xmath0-(bedo - ttf)@xmath1@xmath3 ( @xmath7 = k , rb , cs , nh@xmath8 , li ) @xcite was of interest to us , as these salts crystallize in a 5:2 ratio of cations and anions leading to a 1/5 filling of the conduction band .",
    "it is important for our study , that when going from bedt - ttf to bedo - ttf ( bis - ethylenedioxy - tetrathiafulvalene ) the on - site electron - electron correlation energy does not change considerably.@xcite however , the probability to obtain an insulating and superconducting salt among the bedo - ttf family is lower than among bedt - ttf based ones .",
    "horiuchi et al .  suggested that these differences are due to the fact that the bedo - ttf molecules tend to form conducting layers which are more two - dimensional.@xcite indeed , within the ( bedo - ttf)@xmath1@xmath3 ( @xmath7 = k , rb , cs , nh@xmath8 , li ) family most members exhibit a metallic behavior in the highly - conducting plane down to low temperatures .",
    "the only exception is @xmath0-(bedo - ttf)@xmath1@xmath3 which shows non - metallic behavior of the dc conductivity in one direction of the plane , while in perpendicular direction conductivity remains metallic down to 4  k. previous optical studies of @xmath0-(bedo - ttf)@xmath1@xmath3 in the 700 - 6000  region have also revealed an anisotropic temperature behavior of the optical conductivity;@xcite the reason for this unusual behavior might be a dimerization in the stacks of bedo - ttf molecules .",
    "these investigations also led to the conclusion that at frequencies below the mid - infrared a non - drude response has to be expected .",
    "optical investigations and theoretical studies of bedt - ttf based materials with a metallic ground state have shown that the effects of electronic correlations lead to deviations from the simple drude behavior ; however , the results strongly depend on the band filling . for the metallic half - filled @xmath9-phase compounds",
    "a narrow drude - peak was observed only at temperatures below 50  k,@xcite in accordance with dynamical mean - field - theory calculations @xcite on a frustrated lattice at half - filling with strong on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath10 ( @xmath11 being the bandwidth).@xcite quarter - filled systems , on the other hand , remain metallic for any @xmath12,@xcite as long as the nearest - neighbor interaction @xmath13 is negligible ; by increasing @xmath13 beyond some critical value @xmath14 , charge - ordering phenomena become relevant.@xcite in fact this was recently demonstrated in the spectra of bedt - ttf - based organic conductors with an @xmath15-structure of the conducting layers.@xcite while @xmath15-(bedt - ttf)@xmath3nh@xmath8hg(scn)@xmath8 shows metallic properties at any temperature , in @xmath15-(bedt - ttf)@xmath3khg(scn)@xmath8 a gap opens at about 200  at temperatures below 200  k with a narrow drude component remaining .",
    "however , in some metallic @xmath0-packed bedt - ttf salts which are quarter filled , no drude peak was observed down to 10  k.@xcite    this has motivated us to extend the optical measurements of @xmath0-(bedo - ttf)@xmath1@xmath3 to frequencies well below 700  .",
    "we got an opportunity to study the expected deviations from a simple drude behavior for this 1/5 filled system and to compare them to theoretical expectations and to the low - frequency behavior of a @xmath0-packed bedt - ttf based 1/4 filled system.@xcite in this first low - frequency optical experiment on a bedo - ttf salt , we have also investigated the temperature dependence of the anisotropy which characterizes the in - plane conductivity .",
    "single crystals of @xmath0-(bedo - ttf)@xmath1[cshg(scn)@xmath2@xmath3 were prepared by electrochemical oxidation of bedt - ttf as described in ref .",

    "@xmath0-phase means that the molecules form stacks parallel to the @xmath18-@xmath19 direction ; along the stacks the overlap integrals show some modulation .",
    "the overlap integrals to the molecules in the neighboring stacks are nearly two times larger than between the molecules along the stacking direction.@xcite according to the stoichiometry , each bedo - ttf molecule carries an average charge of @xmath20 , thus the conduction band is 1/5 filled .",

    "the correct absolute values are obtained by normalizing the reflectivity with a constant factor in order to receive perfect agreement with the microscopic measurements at room temperature .",

    "simultaneously , the intensity of optical conductivity @xmath28 in the mid - infrared region between 1000 - 3000  decreases ; also the low - frequency maximum becomes smaller .",
    "this corresponds to the abrupt increase of the the microwave resistivity at 100  k. although @xmath25 becomes metallic below 30  k , the 4  k resistivity is still higher than that at 100  k , in accordance with our optical results : the 4000  is present at the lowest measured temperature of 10  k.",
    "the most important observations of our optical experiments on @xmath0-(bedo - ttf)@xmath1@xmath3 are an extremely narrow drude - component and a gap at about 300  .",
    "a similar overall behavior was previously found in bedt - ttf bases organic conductors with a metallic ground state.@xcite in particular the fact that the low - frequency spectral weight increases several times when the temperature decreases from @xmath4  k to helium temperature , as observed for quite a number of them , @xcite can not be simply explained by a reduced scattering rate which leaves the spectral weight conserved.@xcite therefore these effects are ascribed to the influence of electron - electron correlations .",
    "it is interesting to compare our findings on @xmath0-(bedo - ttf)@xmath1@xmath3 with the optical results @xcite obtained on a superconductor @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath3sf@xmath1ch@xmath3cf@xmath3so@xmath52 ( t@xmath53=5.2  k ) which is a 1/4-filled compound with a similar packing of the cation layers .",

    "the inter - stack overlap , on the other hand , is nearly twice larger for the bedt - ttf - based compound than for the bedo - ttf one . if we assume that the coulomb interactions are comparable for both compounds , the ratios of @xmath54 and @xmath55 are estimated to be larger for @xmath0-(bedo - ttf)@xmath1@xmath3 compared to @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath3sf@xmath1ch@xmath3cf@xmath3so@xmath52 . since the coulomb effects do not drive the system insulating , but we observe a drude peak in our spectra ( fig .",
    "[ optics ] ) , additional effects have to be considered .    an essential difference between these two @xmath0-salts is the filling of the conduction band which is 1/4 for the bedt - ttf - compound and 1/5 for @xmath0-(bedo - ttf)@xmath1@xmath3 .",
    "we suggest that this deviation from the quarter - filled band leads to an appearance of the narrow drude contribution , while the low - frequency gap is still present in the spectra .",
    "the following theoretical considerations confirm this idea .",
    "a theoretical model of charge - ordering in layered molecular crystals with quarter - filled conduction bands has been recently put forward @xcite to describe this family of @xmath0-compounds.@xcite assuming a simple square lattice to describe the quarter - filled molecular planes of the crystal , a checkerboard charge - ordered state is induced if values of the on - site @xmath12 and inter - site coulomb repulsion @xmath13 become large enough with respect to the nearest - neighbors hopping integral @xmath56 .",
    "although for certain ratios of @xmath54 and @xmath55 electronic correlations are not strong enough to push the system into a checkerboard insulating state , they nevertheless lead to strong modifications in the distribution of the optical weight : for instance a low frequency peak appears at the edge of a broad mid - infrared band.@xcite this is related to the dynamics of quasiparticles interacting with short range checkerboard charge fluctuations . for values of @xmath57 and sufficiently large @xmath58 ,",
    "the drude weight obtained from lanczos diagonalization is suppressed signalling the occurrence of a metal - insulator transition ( at quarter - filling ) .",
    "this situation is changed as we dope the system away from one quarter filling .",
    "let us still model the materials by means of an extended hubbard model on a square lattice at arbitrary filling .",
    "a simple understanding of the electronic properties of the system can be obtained by considering the case in which we dope the insulating checkerboard charge - ordered state with only one hole as discussed earlier by ohta and collaborators.@xcite the single hole ( which is an empty site in the checkerboard ) has non - zero probability ( for @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) , to move to a second - nearest neighbor in the diagonal direction by two successive hopping processes through its nearest neighbors .",
    "this is of course a virtual second order process because the electron has to hop twice along its nearest neighbors at the expense of some energy . in a subsequent process",
    "the electron can hop to its third - nearest neighbors and so on .",
    "hence , quasiparticles can disperse with renormalized hopping along the lattice and the system is expected to be always metallic ( at a finite value of @xmath13 ) .",
    "hence , while at 1/4-filling a metal - insulator transition at a finite @xmath14 is expected , this is not the case at 1/5-filling .",
    "this explains why the 1/5-filled salt exhibits a robust drude component in contrast to the 1/4-filled @xmath61 salts .",
    "the short range checkerboard charge fluctuations which lead to signatures in the dynamical properties of the 1/4-filled system ( such as the appearance of the low frequency peak in the optical conductivity ) are also expected to be present in the 1/5-filled system .",
    "however , these signatures are anticipated to be somewhat suppressed at 1/5-filling with respect to 1/4-filling for a given value of @xmath13 because in the former case , the checkerboard charge ordered state is modified by the presence of mobile empty sites .",
    "this arguments are consistent with the observation that while the spectral weight of the feature appearing at low frequencies in the optical conductivity increases by factor of 5 as the temperature is reduced from room temperature to the lowest temperature at 1/4-filling , at 1/5-filling this feature is only enhanced by a factor of approximately 1.5.@xcite     optical conductivity and drude weight from exact diagonalization calculations of an extended hubbard model on a square lattice .",
    "the system is at 1/5-filling , @xmath58 and the cluster size is @xmath62 .",
    "a broadening of @xmath63 has been used for comparison to experimental data . at 1/5-filling ,",
    "the system remains metallic for any value of @xmath13 in contrast with the 1/4-filled salt , which becomes insulating for @xmath57 .",
    "these calculations are consistent with the strong drude component observed in the optical conductivity of 1/5-filled salts in contrast to the weaker one found for their 1/4-filled counterparts .",
    "although strongly suppressed with respect to the 1/4-filled salt , a low frequency feature is evident for the plotted values of @xmath55.,width=264 ]    in fig .",
    "[ figdrude ] we show the behavior of the optical conductivity and the drude weight at 1/5-filling for different values of @xmath13 an @xmath58 , computed from exact diagonalization of an extended hubbard model on a square lattice .",
    "we observe how , at 1/5-filling , the drude weight remains finite ; the system remaining metallic for any value of @xmath13 .",
    "this is in contrast to the metal - insulator transition found at @xmath64 for the 1/4-filled system.@xcite the optical conductivity for typical values of @xmath55 displays a broad band and a feature at low frequencies ; much smaller than the one found for the 1/4-filled case.@xcite the behavior of the optical spectra at low frequencies when going from the 1/4 to the 1/5-filled system is consistent with exact diagonalization results.@xcite    while the features ascribed to the influence of electronic correlations are observed in the spectra of both polarizations , the non - metallic behavior of dc , microwave , and optical conductivity is seen only for @xmath27 parallel to the stacks and can be ascribed to structural effects .",
    "one of the major changes below 100  k affects the broad band at about 2500  .",
    "a wide band in the mid - infrared region is typical for the conductivity spectra of most bedt - ttf and bedo - ttf based materials",
    ". it can appear due to to structural peculiarities : for example , when the filling of the conduction band is not equal to one half , a dimerization in the stacks of the organic molecules can cause the conduction band to split ; transitions across this gap result in a maximum in the optical conductivity spectra.@xcite since in the cation layers of @xmath0-(bedo - ttf)@xmath1@xmath3 the molecules are weakly modulated along the stacks already at room temperature , the wide band with a maximum at about 2500  can be assigned to transitions across the gap caused by this structural modulation .",
    "the shift of this band up to 4000  and the fact that its intensity for the polarization parallel to the stacks grows at temperatures below 150  k points towards a strengthening of the modulation .",
    "the spectral weight of this band increases on the expense of the low - frequency feature : below @xmath65  k the intensity of the 350  maximum is reduced and the 250  gap becomes more distinct ; consequently , the dc and microwave resistivity increase .",
    "most changes in structure and charge on the bedt - ttf molecules in the organic conductors can be nicely followed by observing changes of emv - coupled vibrational features  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath30 vibrations of central c = c bonds of the bedo - ttf molecule observed@xcite at 1619  is known to be most sensitive to the changes of charge on the molecule.@xcite its position does not show any variations with temperature , which suggests that the charge on the bedo - ttf molecules does not change considerably .",
    "on the other hand , for the polarization parallel to the stacks two @xmath30 vibrational modes at 864 and 1015  appear simultaneously with the growth of the 4000  electronic band.@xcite the appearance of new vibrational features indicates a lowering of symmetry : a symmetry center disappears .",
    "since @xmath30 features couple to electrons which are localized on clusters of molecules , we can conclude that these changes in the spectra occur due to a strengthening of the modulation within the stacks of bedo - ttf molecules , which leads to the appearance of clusters ( e.g.  dimers of bedo - ttf ) and lowers the symmetry.@xcite however , for 1/5-filled system the most primitive modulations ( dimerization , teramerisation , etc . )",
    "will not cause a gap at the fermi - surface and lead to a insulating behavior .",
    "maybe this is the reason why we observe such a complicated behavior in the dc and microwave resistivity instead of a simple metal - to - insulator transition .",
    "interestingly , this non - metallic behavior is absent in the direction of the larger overlap of the neighboring molecule orbitals , i.e.  for the polarization @xmath27 perpendicular to the stacks .",
    "the present optical study of @xmath0-(bedo - ttf)@xmath1@xmath3 in the infrared range between 60 and 6000  from room temperature down to 10  k allows us to investigate and distinguish between two effects relevant to most of the two - dimensional organic conductors .",
    "electronic correlations lead to the presence of a narrow drude - like contribution and to a pseudogap at about 300  in the optical conductivity @xmath28 .",
    "these features are observed for both principal directions in the conducting plane , parallel and perpendicular to the stacks , and in the whole temperature range , from 10  k up to room temperature .",
    "the maximum in the optical conductivity due to excitations across the pseudogap shift to low frequencies as the temperature decreases .",
    "comparing our results on the bedot - ttf systems with the optical data of bedt - ttf at 1/4-filling , we propose that the robustness of the drude contribution in our spectra is due to the fact that the conduction band is 1/5 filled .",
    "we have used an extended hubbard model with @xmath60 on a square lattice at different fillings to model the molecular planes . at quarter - filling",
    "there is a critical value , @xmath66 , at which a metal - insulator transition to a checkerboard charge ordered state occurs .",
    "optical conductivity close to but in the metallic side of this transition displays a strong suppression of the drude component and transfer of weight to a broad mid - infrared band . at 1/5-filling , however ,",
    "empty sites induced by doping the checkerboard propagate along the molecular planes leading to metallic behavior .",
    "this explains the strong drude component observed in the optical conductivity at 1/5-filling .",
    "it would very interesting to analyze materials with other fillings so that an understanding of the dynamics of holes in a charge ordered background can be achieved",
    ".    at temperatures below 100  k structural modulations along the stacks of bedo - ttf molecules activate a band at 4000  and new emv - coupled features for the polarization @xmath27 parallel to the stacks . in the dc and microwave resistivity this effect is observed as a non - metallic behavior in this direction .",

    "<S> the polarized reflectivity of @xmath0-(bedo - ttf)@xmath1[cshg(scn)@xmath2@xmath3 is studied in the infrared range between 60  and 6000  from room temperature down to 10  k. already at @xmath4  k a pseudogap in the optical conductivity is present of about 300  ; the corresponding maximum in the spectrum shifts to lower frequencies as the temperature decreases . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to quarter - filled bedt - ttf - based conductors of the @xmath0-phase a robust drude component in the conductivity spectra is observed which we ascribe to the larger fraction of charge carriers associated with the 1/5-filling of the conduction band . </S>",
    "<S> this observation is corroborated by exact diagonalization calculations on an extended hubbard model on a square lattice for different fillings . </S>",
    "<S> a broad band at 4000  which appears for the electric field polarized parallel to the stacks of the bedo - ttf molecules is associated to structural modulations in the stacks ; these modulations lead to a rise of the dc and microwave resistivity in 100 to 30  k temperature range . </S>"
