    "a large fraction of the stars in the galaxy reside in multiple systems .",
    "generally , higher multiplicity fractions are found as the stellar mass increases , with a binarity fraction reaching @xmath280@xmath6 for b stars @xcite . at the other end of the distribution , surveys of very low mass ( vlm , mass @xmath7m@xmath1 ) stars and brown dwarfs ( bds ) ,",
    "both in the field and in star forming regions , have found a binary fraction of @xmath220@xmath6 @xcite ; corrections for incompleteness of tight systems could revise this number to a higher value .",
    "there are important differences between the vlm binary systems and their more massive counterparts , possibly reflecting differences in their formation mechanism .",
    "the mass ratio distribution of vlm binaries is strongly peaked at unity @xcite , whereas it is more evenly distributed between 0 and 1 for more massive stars .",
    "the results of @xcite indicate that around 50% of solar - type binary systems have separations larger than @xmath240  au , and that these systems can have separations as large as @xmath220  000  au . on the other hand ,",
    "small separations are strongly favored among vlm binary systems , less than @xmath5 of which have separations larger than 20  au @xcite .    to date",
    ", only five vlm systems with separation @xmath8  au are known , two in the field , koenigstuhl 1ab ( 1800  au ) and denis j055146.0 - 443412.2ab ( 220  au ) @xcite , and three in star forming regions : 2mass j1623361 - 240221 ( 212  au ) , 2mass j1101192 - 773238ab ( 242  au ) , and 2mass j1622252 - 240514 ( 243  au ) @xcite . a possible binary system having a separation @xmath21700 au was recently identified in the @xmath9  orionis cluster @xcite , but this system lacks proper motion ( pm ) confirmation of physical association . in this letter we report the identification of 2mass  j012655.49 - 502238.8 and 2mass  j012702.83 - 502321.1 as part of a vlm binary system ( hereafter referred to as 2m0126ab ) with a projected separation of @xmath25100  au .",
    "the system was found by comparing the positions of the 2mass point source catalogue @xcite with those of the @xmath10-band digitized sky survey images to search for relatively high pm ( @xmath1101  yr@xmath12 ) bd candidates at high galactic latitudes ( @xmath13 ) . among the sample of candidates found ,",
    "the two sources mentioned above appeared to share the same pm .",
    "this was further confirmed using @xmath14-band observations obtained on 2006 june  21 with the observatoire du mont mgantic wide field near - infrared camera cpapir ( artigau et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , currently installed at the ctio 1.5-m telescope .",
    "the near - infrared colors ( table  [ tbl-1 ] ) of both components are indicative of late - m dwarfs @xcite and their apparent magnitudes place them at a similar distance , suggesting a physical association ( see  [ random ] ) .",
    "we obtained near - infrared spectroscopic observations ( r@xmath21700 ) of 2mass j012655.49 - 502238.8 ( component a ) and 2mass j012702.83 - 502321.1 ( component b ) with the gnirs spectrograph @xcite at the gemini south telescope on 2006 august 11 ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) with a 03 slit under a 07 - 10 seeing .",
    "for each component , 15 individual spectra were obtained for a total integration time of 15 minutes , and their median combination has a signal - to - noise ratio of about 30 per resolution element ( 2 pixels at r@xmath15 ) in the @xmath14 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 bands . the a0 star hd8341 was observed for telluric absorption calibration .",
    "a summary of all measurements and derived parameters is presented in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "the proper motion of each component was calculated from their positions in the supercosmos sky survey ( sss ) @xmath10-band catalog @xcite , the 2mass psc , and the cpapir observations ; the corresponding epochs are 1983.661 , 1999.778 , and 2006.469 . a correction of ( @xmath18 )",
    "was applied to the sss coordinates to account for a local systematic offset with respect to the 2mass psc , as determined from the comparison of @xmath19 stars located within 15  from 2m0126ab .",
    "the astrometry of the cpapir observations was calibrated by using the 2mass psc as a reference frame , and the relative astrometric uncertainty after calibration was found to be 016 .",
    "the uncertainties on the sss coordinates ( 015 , 03 ) and the 2mass coordinates ( 007,007 ) were estimated from @xcite and the 2mass psc , respectively .",
    "an error - weighted linear regression was performed to obtain the pms and the corresponding uncertainties .",
    "the pm values found for a and b , respectively @xmath20 and @xmath21  mas / yr in right ascension and @xmath22 and @xmath23  mas / yr in declination , agree within @xmath24 .",
    "although the available data make it difficult to quantify , one may assume that part of the uncertainty on the individual pms arises from calibration errors common to both objects , so that the uncertainties on the difference in pm may be smaller than indicated by the above values .",
    "the spectral types were derived primarily from cross - correlation of both spectra with those of known m5-m9 dwarfs obtained with spex at the irtf ( rayner et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the wavelength intervals used for the cross - correlation were : @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28  @xmath3 m .",
    "spectral types of m6.5-m7 and m8 were found for components a and b respectively ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the spectral indices defined in @xcite yield spectral types of m@xmath29-m@xmath30 and m@xmath29-l@xmath31 for a and b respectively , consistent with the previous determination .",
    "the relatively short wavelength intervals ( 0.004  @xmath3 m ) used for calculating these indices combined with the modest signal - to - noise ratio of our spectra explain the larger uncertainty on the spectral types using this scheme .",
    "the equivalent widths ( ews ) of the ki lines at 1.169 , 1.177 , 1.244 , and 1.253  @xmath3 m for components a and b ( see table  [ tbl-1 ] ) are consistent with those of m6-m6.5 and m7-m9 dwarfs respectively , based on figure 14 and 15 of @xcite . considering all of these measurements , we adopt a spectral type of m6.5v for a and m8v for b with an uncertainty of @xmath32 .",
    ".parameters of 2mass j0126ab[tbl-1 ] [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     photometric distances of @xmath33  pc and @xmath34  pc are calculated for a and b respectively from comparison of their @xmath35 magnitudes with the absolute magnitudes of other dwarfs of the same spectral types with known trigonometric parallaxes .",
    "using the spectral type@xmath36effective temperature ( @xmath37 ) relation of @xcite , we infer @xmath38  k for a and @xmath39  k for b. according to evolution models @xcite , such temperatures imply masses below 0.1  m@xmath1 , irrespective of the system age .",
    "assuming a late - m dwarf spatial density of @xmath40  pc@xmath41 per @xmath10-band magnitude interval @xcite , there should be @xmath22700 m6-m8 dwarfs ( @xmath42m@xmath43 ) between 55 and 68  pc from the sun .",
    "considering that an 82@xmath44 radius disk occupies @xmath45 of the sky , and assuming an isotropic distribution of late - ms out to @xmath46  pc , the probability of finding at least one such pair of objects over the whole sky from chance alignment is @xmath47 , regardless of their apparent proper motion .",
    "a monte carlo calculation was performed to determine the probability that two m dwarfs located in the direction of 2m0126ab have pms larger than 01 yr@xmath12 that agree with each other within our uncertainties at the 2  @xmath9 level . using the observed dispersions in ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) of late - m dwarfs in the solar neighborhood @xcite , including the disk and halo components , and converting these velocities into pms at the position of 2m0126ab , the probability is @xmath51 .",
    "thus , the combined probability of finding a pair of late - m dwarfs within 82@xmath44 of each other and sharing the same proper motion within our uncertainties is 2@xmath52 .",
    "therefore , 2m0126ab is very likely a bound system rather than a random alignment of two unrelated objects .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the ews of feh and ki provide a rough constraint on surface gravity .",
    "indeed , the strength of these features in late - type m dwarfs is systematically higher ( by a factor 1.5 - 2.0 ) for field objects compared to young ( @xmath53  myr ) cluster members .",
    "based on figure  8 of @xcite , the measured feh 1.20@xmath3 m and ki 1.25@xmath3 m ews of components a and b are in better agreement with those of relatively old field objects .",
    "the mass of each component can be determined from comparison of near - infrared absolute magnitudes with evolution models @xcite assuming an age for the system .",
    "if we suppose an age greater than 1 gyr , as suggested by the gravity sensitive spectral indices , we derive masses of @xmath54 and @xmath55  m@xmath1 for the two components .",
    "although the feh and ki ews are consistent with relatively old field objects , the age of 2m0126ab remains poorly constrained given the small difference in ew between field and very young dwarfs and the significant dispersion of those values ( see figure  8 of @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , there is some evidence that 2m0126ab might be part of a young association . on the sky",
    ", it lies in the core of the young ( @xmath230  myr ) tucana / horologium ( th ) association ( @xcite and references therein ) located at a distance of 37 - 66 pc , consistent with that estimated for 2m0126ab .",
    "furthermore , both the amplitude and direction of its pm are similar to those of nearby members ( see figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "we note , however , that the amplitude of the pm of 2m0126ab ( 142  mas / yr ) is slightly larger than the largest pm of nearby members ( 124  mas / yr ) .",
    "the pm dispersion of members of the association is @xmath211  mas / yr , and is representative of relatively massive members ( @xmath110.5 m@xmath1 ) .",
    "the dispersion is expected to be significantly higher for lower mass members ( see figure  4 of @xcite ) .",
    "an age of 30 myr for 2m0126ab would imply that the two components are bds with masses of @xmath56 and @xmath57  m@xmath1 .",
    "future determinations of the trigonometric parallax , the radial velocity , the lithium abundance , the surface gravity , and the h@xmath58 or emission of 2m0126ab will help in settling this issue , and in refining the physical characterization of the system .    in the scenario where 2m0126ab is a member of the th association , the random alignment probability determined earlier needs",
    "to be re - evaluated ; the major argument in favor of a physical association now being the relatively small angular separation of the system given the low stellar density of the association .",
    "the association has a diameter of approximately 30 pc , hence a volume of @xmath59  pc@xmath60 .",
    "the uncertainties on the distance of both components and their angular separation place them within a volume @xmath61 times smaller . assuming a kroupa three - segment imf @xcite , and knowing that there are 42 members of the th association between b8 and k5 ( roughly 4  m@xmath1 to 0.67  m@xmath1 )",
    ", we estimate that the association comprises 32 objects in the mass interval between @xmath62m@xmath1 and @xmath63m@xmath1 . given these numbers , the probability that the two components are not physically bound is only . even assuming a factor of 5 underestimate of the number of low - mass objects in the association",
    ", this probability would still be only 2  @xmath6 .    at a distance of 62  pc ,",
    "the measured angular separation of the system corresponds to a projected physical separation of @xmath25100  au , more than twice that of the koenigstuhl  1ab system @xcite and @xmath220  times greater than those of other known wide vlm binaries ( see figure  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "because of projection effects , the real separation is expected to be , on average , 1.4 times larger @xcite which , in the present case , would be @xmath27000 au . prior to the discovery of 2m0126ab , projected separations of @xmath25000",
    "au had been observed only for systems of total mass @xmath64  m@xmath1 .",
    "the low total mass and large separation of 2m0126ab raise the question of its dynamical stability .",
    "an order of magnitude estimate of the expected survival time of 2m0126ab can be obtained from the work of @xcite .",
    "stellar and giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) encounters are the dominant source of disruption for low - mass binaries , and these contributions are dependent on the mass / separation ratio only , implying that the results derived for more massive binaries can be scaled to the 2m0126ab system .",
    "given this scaling relation and figure  2 of @xcite , the stellar and gmc encounter disruption timescale of 2m0126ab is @xmath2200  myr if it is a member of the 30 myr old th association or @xmath21  gyr if it is a field object .",
    "the first timescale above is well beyond the age of the th association , while the second may indicate that 2m0126ab is likely younger than 2 - 3 gyr .",
    "further , the second timescale above is long enough for a significant number of similar binaries produced throughout the history of the galaxy to have survived to this day .",
    "the formation process of vlm stars and bds is the subject of an active debate , partly because their mass is less than @xmath20.7  m@xmath1 , the typical jeans mass in molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "however , it has been shown recently @xcite that turbulence can lead to fragmentation of unstable cores with masses as small as @xmath20.003  m@xmath1 .",
    "a possibility is that vlm stars and bds are such low - mass embryos dynamically ejected out of their feeding zone during the early stages of formation @xcite .",
    "this is a popular scenario because it agrees with the observation that most vlm binaries have close separations , weakly bound wider binaries being easily disrupted by the ejection .",
    "nevertheless , detailed simulations @xcite of this mechanism have succeeded in producing some vlm binaries with separations @xmath2100  au , similar to the four previously known vlm binaries mentioned above albeit with lower mass ratios .",
    "these wide binaries result when low mass cores become bound following ejection from the cluster at the same time and in the same direction .",
    "it remains to be seen whether binaries like 2m0126ab , with orbital separations @xmath220  times larger , can be produced by this mechanism .",
    "photo - evaporation of pre - stellar cores by the strong ionizing radiation of nearby massive stars @xcite is another possible vlm star and bd formation process .",
    "however , the presence of massive stars required for this to happen would most likely disrupt a vlm binary such as the one described here .",
    "formation of the secondary by direct gravitational collapse within the accretion disk of the primary @xcite is yet another possibility , but it is unlikely to form nearly equal mass binaries and would require a disk of unreasonably large spatial extent .    the formation of bds following the encounter of proto - stellar disks has been shown possible in simulations @xcite . in this case , the disks are normally stable against gravitational collapse ; it is only the violent collision between two disks that triggers instabilities leading to the formation of bds .",
    "although current simulations are not sufficient to address directly the question of wide binary bd formation , the results indicate that about one third of the bds produced are ejected from the system , and wide binaries may result as in the ejection scenario discussed above .",
    "so far , the simulations have only produced bd mass objects and not vlm stars through this mechanism .",
