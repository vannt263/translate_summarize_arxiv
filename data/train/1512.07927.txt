    "we have recently derived the equations of motion for a kinetic fluid on a finsler spacetime background , including the most general case of cosmological symmetry.@xcite this previous work provided an extension of the kinetic theory of fluids@xcite to the finsler spacetime framework.@xcite here we discuss a particular subclass of these models , where the cosmological symmetry group is the group @xmath0 . in this case",
    "it is possible to use a particular set of coordinates on the tangent bundle @xmath1 of the spacetime manifold @xmath2 which highly simplify the derivation .",
    "the aim of this work is to introduce this new set of coordinates and to show its usefulness for describing cosmological symmetry in finsler geometric theories of gravity .",
    "the outline of this article is as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "cosmology ] we discuss the cosmological symmetry and introduce adapted coordinates on the tangent bundle @xmath1 .",
    "we then use these coordinates to derive the most general finsler geometric background obeying this symmetry in section  [ sec : finsler ] and its observer space in section  [ sec : obs ] . using this background geometry",
    ", we derive the liouville equation for a collisionless fluid in section  [ sec : fluid ] .",
    "we end with a conclusion in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we start with a brief review of the cosmological symmetry we intend to impose . here",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case that the spatial geometry of the cosmological background is closed , and thus diffeomorphic to @xmath3 .",
    "we first introduce cartesian coordinates @xmath4 on the embedding space @xmath5 , from which we derive the physical subspace @xmath6 the group of cosmological symmetries on @xmath7 we consider is @xmath0 generated by the vector fields @xmath8 where @xmath9 .",
    "these vector fields are tangent to @xmath2 , and thus leave the physical spacetime invariant .",
    "they generate the rotations and translations of @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "note that any vector field @xmath10 on @xmath7 generates a one - parameter group of diffeomorphisms @xmath11 .",
    "the differentials @xmath12 of these diffeomorphisms constitute a one - parameter group of diffeomorphisms @xmath13 of the tangent bundle , which is generated by a vector field @xmath14 on @xmath15 .",
    "this vector field is called the complete lift of @xmath10 . from the coordinates",
    "@xmath16 on @xmath7 one can construct induced coordinates @xmath17 on @xmath15 , and write the corresponding coordinate vector fields on @xmath15 as @xmath18 .",
    "the complete lift of a vector field @xmath19 on @xmath2 then takes the form @xmath20 for the symmetry generating vector fields   we thus find @xmath21 using induced coordinates @xmath22 on @xmath15 .",
    "since our description of fluid dynamics will be based on geometric quantities defined on the tangent bundle of @xmath2 , and these quantities obey cosmological symmetry in the sense that they are invariant under the action of the symmetry generating vector fields above , we introduce coordinates on @xmath1 in which the restrictions @xmath23 and @xmath24 of the symmetry generators simplify . here",
    "we use coordinates @xmath25 such that    @xmath26    where the matrix @xmath27 is given by @xmath28 in these coordinates the linear combinations @xmath29 take the simple form    [ eqn : cosmovect ] @xmath30    these are the coordinates we will be working with in the following sections .",
    "we now discuss the background geometry we need for our description of fluid dynamics .",
    "note that the tangent bundle @xmath1 itself already comes with a number of geometric structures , which are useful for defining finsler geometry without using induced coordinates.@xcite most important for our construction are the tangent and cotangent structures , which can be defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath31 be the bundle map of @xmath1 .",
    "its differential @xmath32 assigns to every vector @xmath33 a vector @xmath34 .",
    "since both @xmath35 and @xmath36 are elements of the same tangent vector space @xmath37 , we can construct a curve @xmath38 on @xmath1 and define @xmath39 as the tangent vector of this curve at @xmath40 .",
    "the map @xmath41 is called the tangent structure .",
    "it can be represented as a @xmath42-tensor field on @xmath1 , which can be written in matrix form as @xmath43 in the coordinate basis on @xmath1 .",
    "its dual map @xmath44 defined by @xmath45 is called the cotangent structure .",
    "its matrix representation is given by the transpose of the matrix representation of @xmath46 .",
    "another structure can be derived from the fact that every element @xmath47 , being an element of a vector space @xmath48 for some @xmath49 , can be multiplied by a real number .",
    "this induces a one - parameter group of diffeomorphisms @xmath50 as @xmath51 .",
    "the generating vector field of @xmath52 is called the liouville vector field @xmath53 .",
    "it takes the form @xmath54 in the coordinates we are using .",
    "we now equip @xmath1 with the most general finsler geometry which obeys cosmological symmetry as defined in the previous section .",
    "our starting point is the finsler function @xmath55 , which is one - homogeneous , continuous on @xmath1 and smooth on the space @xmath56 defined as @xmath1 without the null structure.@xcite using the vector fields introduced above , the conditions of homogeneity and cosmological symmetry read @xmath57 the most general finsler function satisfying these conditions takes the form @xmath58 for some smooth function @xmath59 .",
    "we then construct the cartan one - form @xmath60\\,,\\ ] ] where the subscript @xmath61 indicates a derivative with respect to the second argument of @xmath59 .",
    "its exterior derivative @xmath62 , called the cartan two - form , is a symplectic form on @xmath56 .",
    "it can be used to define the geodetic spray as the unique vector field @xmath63 on @xmath56 such that @xmath64 this finally yields @xmath65 the geodetic spray has a simple geometric interpretation .",
    "its integral curves are the canonical lifts of curves on @xmath2 which minimize the finsler length functional and correspond to the trajectories of freely falling test masses .",
    "in the previous section we have discussed the finsler background geometry on ( almost ) the whole tangent bundle @xmath1 . for the kinetic theory of fluids , however , we are interested only in those tangent vectors which correspond to physically allowed four - velocities .",
    "these constitute a submanifold @xmath66 , which we call observer space .",
    "its elements are future timelike and normalized by the finsler function  , such that @xmath67 .",
    "further , the geodetic spray @xmath63 is tangent to @xmath68 .",
    "its restriction @xmath69 is called the reeb vector field .    in order to derive the reeb vector field , which is necessary for the description of fluid dynamics , we first introduce new coordinates @xmath70 on @xmath1 such that @xmath71 in these",
    "coordinates the geodetic spray   takes the simple form @xmath72 these coordinates further have the advantage that the observer space @xmath68 is given as a connected component of the submanifold @xmath73 , so that one can use the remaining seven coordinates to parametrize @xmath68 . the reeb vector field",
    ", being the restriction of the geodetic spray to this submanifold , thus reads @xmath74 this will be the central ingredient for our definition of fluid dynamics in the next section .",
    "we finally come to the discussion of fluid dynamics on the finsler spacetime background derived above , making use of the kinetic theory of fluids.@xcite since the background geometry obeys cosmological symmetry , the canonical lifts   are tangent to the observer space @xmath68 .",
    "a fluid obeys the same symmetry if and only if its one - particle distribution function @xmath75 is invariant under the restriction of these canonical lifts to @xmath68 . in the present case the most general one - particle distribution function satisfying",
    "this condition takes the form @xmath76 .",
    "its lie derivative with respect to the reeb vector field   is thus given by @xmath77 for the simplest possible case of a collisionless fluid the equations of motion hence take the form @xmath78 this is the liouville equation for a fluid with cosmological symmetry .",
    "we have derived the equations of motion for a collisionless fluid on a finsler background geometry obeying the cosmological symmetry group @xmath0 . for this purpose we introduced coordinates on the tangent bundle of the spacetime manifold , in which the generators of the cosmological symmetry simplify significantly , and expressed all relevant finsler geometric quantities in these coordinates .",
    "the result we present here is the first step towards understanding the cosmological dynamics of finsler geometric theories of gravity . the basic idea behind this research is to consider a kinetic fluid , as used in this article , as the source of gravity , in analogy to the classical perfect fluid in metric cosmology . a necessary ingredient , besides the fluid dynamics presented here , is a thorough understanding of the most general finsler geometric spacetime with cosmological symmetry . by introducing a suitable set of coordinates",
    ", we provide a way to achieve this understanding .    using a different choice of coordinates ,",
    "this work can easily be generalized .",
    "this will allow a description of fluid dynamics on finsler geometric backgrounds whose cosmological symmetry is given by the groups @xmath79 and @xmath80 , corresponding to hyperbolic and flat spatial geometries .",
    "these will be discussed in future work .",
