    "a wide new field for investigating complex many - body systems has been opened by the idea that clouds of atoms can be cooled to very low temperatures by sophisticated cooling techniques @xcite .",
    "such an atomic cloud can be brought into a periodic potential which is created by counterpropagating laser fields @xcite .",
    "this potential mimics the lattice of core atoms of a solid - state system and is called optical lattice due to its origin .",
    "it allows the simulation of conventional condensed - matter systems as well as the creation of new many - body systems .",
    "new quantum states can emerge due to the interplay of tunneling and interaction between the atoms .    in the following ,",
    "a cloud of spin-1/2 fermionic atoms in an optical lattice is considered , where an attractive interaction between atoms in nearest - neighbor lattice wells is assumed .",
    "our aim is to study different quantum phases that can appear due to the formation and dissociation of molecules , and condensation of the ( bosonic ) molecules .",
    "our atomic cloud in an optical lattice is described by a grand - canonical system of spin-1/2 fermions at temperature @xmath0 and chemical potentials @xmath1 and @xmath2 , referring to the two possible projections of the spin .",
    "its partition function is defined as a functional integral with respect to grassmann fields as @xcite : @xmath3 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the action @xmath5 @xmath6d\\tau . \\label{model}\\ ] ] @xmath7 is the tunneling rate of single fermions , whereas @xmath8 is the rate for tunneling of a pair of fermions , located at nearest - neighbor sites in the optical lattice .",
    "the @xmath8-term represents an attractive interaction .",
    "in contrast to a local interaction , it provides a dynamics for the molecules . depending on the ratio @xmath9",
    ", there is a competition between the individual fermion dynamics ( dominating for @xmath10 ) and the dynamics of molecules ( dominating for @xmath11 ) .",
    "we decouple the @xmath8-term in the functional integral by two complex fields @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "@xmath12 is related to the order parameter for the formation of molecules , and @xmath13 is required for stabilizing the complex integral .",
    "a subsequent integration over the grassmann fields leads to @xmath14 where @xmath15 and a nearest - neighbor matrix @xmath16 whose elements are @xmath17 on the @xmath18-dimensional lattice .",
    "moreover , we have @xmath19 . the saddle - point ( sp ) approximation @xmath20 for uniform fields and @xmath21 leads to the bcs - type mean - field result : @xmath22 with @xmath23 and the density of states @xmath24 of free particles in the optical lattice .",
    "the mean - field calculations gives three phases : an empty phase , a mott insulator and a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of the molecules whose condensate density is @xmath25 the latter is plotted in fig .",
    "[ aba : fig1 ] , and the phase diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ aba : fig2 ] .",
    "excitations out of the molecular bec can be described by gaussian fluctuations around the sp solution by complex fields @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "using @xmath26 , @xmath27 , the corresponding action is @xmath28 with @xmath29^{2}.\\ ] ] the above result reads in terms of fourier coordinates @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a 4 by 4 propagator , @xmath32 is a four - component spinor",
    ". more details of the calculation can be found in ref .",
    "the excitation spectrum @xmath33 is the solution of @xmath34 this gives the bogoliubov spectrum in the molecular bec and a gapped spectrum outside the bec ( see fig .",
    "[ aba : fig3 ] ) .",
    "our mean - field approach also allows us to consider an unbalanced molecular condensate @xcite by imposing different chemical potentials for the two spin projections of the fermions , @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "although we can not address questions about nonlocal properties ( like phase separation @xcite ) directly within our mean - field approach , the effect of two chemical potentials provides interesting effects even in a uniform system .",
    "in particular , the existence of a first - order phase transition , usually leading to phase separation , can be studied with the mean - field action of the unbalanced system @xmath37dx , \\ ] ] where @xmath38 this gives a first order - phase transition due to two separated minima in the mean - field action for small @xmath39 or for larger @xmath39 , depending on @xmath40 and @xmath7 ( for fixed @xmath8 ) ( cf .",
    "[ aba : fig4 ] ) .    for small single - fermion tunneling rate @xmath7 , there is a spin - polarized phase simply because one spin projection has a negative chemical potential .",
    "this can happen for small @xmath39 ( cf .",
    "[ aba : fig5 ] ) .",
    "if @xmath7 is larger , there is a shift of the chemical potential in eq .",
    "( [ en ] ) by the single - fermion tunneling rate .",
    "this prevents the appearence of a spin - polarized state for small @xmath39 but it leads to a sudden disappearence of the molecular condensate at large @xmath41 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ aba : fig5 ] .",
    "this is accompanied by a first - order phase transition . at the point @xmath42",
    "there might be a coexistence of molecules and spin polarized fermions @xcite .    in conclusion , our mean - field approach to the model of eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) reduces to a bsc - type theory of molecules for spin-1/2 fermions with attractive interaction .",
    "it also provides a mott insulator and a spin - polarized phase .",
    "the gaussian fluctuations describe bogoliubov - type excitations of a molecular condensate and the gapped excitation spectrum of a mott insulator .",
