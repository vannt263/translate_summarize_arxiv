    "recently , graphene@xcite has greatly attracted multifarious research activities owing to its rich and unexpected phenomena , also its remarkable promise for future nanoelectronics application .",
    "it is an unique two dimensional ( 2d ) system with one atomic layer in current physics .",
    "its honeycomb structure provides some unconventional physics behaviors .",
    "different from the usual parabola energy spectrum of excitation in usual semiconductor and fermi - liquid , the graphene has a dirac - like linear , massless in low energy spectrum of excitation ( up to energies of the order of 1000 k ) and the pseudospin degeneracy that make the graphene to be a truly 2d relativistic  electronic system in solid and can be described by a low energy @xmath0 dimensional effective massless dirac theory@xcite with a fermi velocity @xmath1 @xmath2 .",
    "its massless linear energy spectrum presents unconventional physical behaviors such as its integer quantum hall conductance ( iqhc ) predicted theoretically@xcite and verified experimentally@xcite , tunnelling through a potential barrier in graphene@xcite and others . rather different from 2d electron gas ( 2deg ) , graphene has two dirac points in its fermion spectrum which are at the fermi energy for undoped system . in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field",
    ", the energy spectrum of graphene contains positive and negative landau levels , as well as a zero energy landau level .",
    "it is quite different from the standard 2deg .",
    "thus iqhc of graphene shows quite different behavior from conventional iqhc@xcite .",
    "ones have known that a wide class of topological phases is tightly related with the existence of edge states .",
    "iqhc and quantum spin hall conductance ( qshc ) are two examples@xcite . different from iqhc",
    "whose presence fundamentally relies on the breaking of the time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) via applied external magnetic field or intrinsic su(2 ) gauge flux@xcite , trs is retained in quantum spin hall effect ( qshe ) that ensures the gapless of edge states and robust to non - magnetic disorder owing to kramers degeneracy .",
    "it turns out that a @xmath3-valued topological invariant associates with qshe@xcite . a theoretical model of graphene with soc",
    "was suggested to explore the topological phase of qshe by kane and mele@xcite . in their work ,",
    "following two kinds of soc were introduced :    i ) .",
    "intrinsic soc provided from the next nearest neighbor ( n.n.n . ) spin - dependent hopping term that is something similar to haldane s picture@xcite .",
    "this kind of soc can generate a bulk energy gap@xcite and convert graphene from a 2d gapless semiconductor to a topological insulator that presents the qshe@xcite and robust to non - magnetic disorder owing to trs@xcite ;    ii ) .",
    "rashba soc@xcite induced by structure inversion asymmetry .",
    "it has been known that qshe will be gradually destroyed as invasion of the rashba soc@xcite .    however , according to the work by y. yao et al.@xcite , the soc ( @xmath4 ) in graphene is much smaller than the one suggested by kane s model@xcite .",
    "therefore the soc in graphene has been neglected in most works .",
    "however , the fundamental picture of qshe in theoretical model with artificial soc in graphene and clear understanding the competition among the rashba , intrinsic soc and other possible external controllable parameters to effect on the phase of qshe is very important@xcite .    in the physics",
    ", there might be some correspondence between bulk and edge states in topological states@xcite like the iqhc and qshc , the study of edge states has became a hot topic recently . to study of the edge states of monolayer and bilayer graphene naturally becomes one of the research subjects .",
    "it has been found that a non - dispersive zero mode of the edge states ( namely a flat band in zero energy ) appears in the graphene ribbons ( gr ) with zigzag edges ( gr - zze ) . if the n.n.n . hopping @xmath5(@xmath6 ,",
    "here @xmath7 is the energy of nearest neighbor ( n.n . )",
    "hopping ) is taken into account , its zero mode of the edge states will be changed from the non - dispersive to dispersive@xcite .",
    "it has been also shown that no edge state exists in gr with armchair edges ( gr - ace ) .    in bilayer graphene ( bg ) , the spectrum of low energy excitation becomes massive , but it still keeps gapless@xcite . when an electric bias field is applied between two layers of bg , its gapless spectrum can be opened and the gap opened can be tuned by the bias voltage@xcite . such transition from gapless to a gapful semiconductor",
    "has been observed in experiement@xcite .",
    "it was shown that the edge states do exist in bg - zze@xcite , but not in bg - ace .",
    "in terms of exact diagonal method , this paper would give more detail studies on the edge states for monolayer and bilayer graphene ribbons ( bgr ) with / without soc as well as the decoration of edges ( de ) .",
    "when the hopping constants connected to the edge sites are chosen as a different value from ones in bulk , it is found that some extra edge states can be created for both gr - zze and gr - ace .",
    "it may suggest a way to manipulate the transport behavior of gr by means of decorating the edge layers . in our calculations , we show that different behaviors even both the intralayer rashba soc and the interlayer rashba go against the phase of topological insulators .",
    "the invasion of intralayer rashba soc in bg reduces the gap in bulk energy spectrum induced by intrinsic soc down to zero@xcite , but the interlayer rashba soc will open a gap for the band of edge states fulfilled in the bulk gap region that drives such topological edge semimetal  back to be an insulator .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in sec . [",
    "sect : edgestate1 ] , we summarize the results of edge states in graphene with and without de , but no soc is considered .",
    "the effect of soc on the energy spectrum , particularly on the edge states , of gr is reported in sec .",
    "[ sect : edgestate2 ] .",
    "[ sect : edgestate3 ] presents our results on the edge states for bgr .",
    "finally , we give a brief conclusion in sec .",
    "[ sect : conclusions ] .",
    "the electronic transport in graphene is mainly contributed by @xmath8 orbitals . a tight - binding approximation ( tba ) has been well applied and a theoretical model hamiltonian is    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in fig .",
    "[ fig : seven ] , we give the energy spectrum of the electrons for bgr - ace ( a ) and bgr - zze ( b)-(d ) . in our precise calculation",
    ", it is shown that no edge state can be found in bgr - ace even for biased case ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : seven](a ) ) . as we have known that linear dispersive spectrum near dirac point in unbiased bg is changed to be parabolic due to interlayer coupling , but no gap is opened .",
    "if a bias field is applied between two layers of bg , a gap will be open in bulk energy spectrum@xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : seven](a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "the edge states are found for bgr - zze and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : seven](b ) where two degenerated modes of edge states in two decoupled gr - zze now are splitted and mixed due to the interlayer coupling@xcite .",
    "if the n.n.n .",
    "hopping is taken into account , the electron - hole symmetry will be broken . in fig .",
    "[ fig : seven](c ) and ( d ) , the bulk energy gap is opened by intrinsic soc , and edge states are found in bgr - zze .",
    "the difference of figure ( b ) and ( c ) is that the bulk gap in ( b ) is induced by bias voltage @xmath9 only , but ( c ) by the intrinsic soc only .",
    "they show very different feature of edge states .",
    "figure ( c ) very clearly shows two dirac cones where the up - down shift of two dirac cones is from the interlayer coupling .",
    "the trs at crossing points @xmath10 and @xmath11 in figure ( c ) is preserved , but the degeneracy at two crossing points @xmath12 and @xmath13 in figure(c ) are accidental and easily splitted by interlayer rashba soc @xmath14 that is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : eight](d ) .",
    "the difference of fig .",
    "[ fig : seven](c ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : seven](d ) shows that further increasing the bias field will reduce the bulk energy gap opened by intrinsic soc of bgr - zze .",
    "it is interested that bias voltage is favorable to open bulk energy gap for bgr - zze without intrinsic soc , but becomes unfavorable to keep a gap for the bgr - zze system with intrinsic soc@xcite .    in fig.[fig : eight ] , we report some results on the competition among the rashba , intrinsic soc and bias field . we show that both the intralayer and interlayer rashba soc can induce the spin polarization and decrease the energy gap ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : eight](a ) and ( b ) ) , here the bulk energy gap has been opened by bias voltage @xmath9 .",
    "the difference of ( c ) and ( d ) points out that the interlayer rashba soc @xmath15 changes the edge states to be gapful . but",
    "the dirac points are still preserved by trs .",
    "in terms of exact diagonal method , we first report our studies on the edge states for the gr with edge decoration .",
    "when the edges of gr has no decoration , perfect boundaries , the edge states exist only for gr - zze , gr - zbe and gr - bbe , but not for gr - ace , even for biased / unbiased bgr - ace .",
    "however , some extra new edge states can be created for all gr with decorated edges including gr - ace . in second ,",
    "the effects of both the intralayer rashba and intrinsic soc on the energy spectrum are studied in detail for gr and bgr .",
    "it is shown that the rashba soc provides the unfavorable factor to the topological insulator through the deduction of the bulk energy gap .",
    "however , the intrinsic soc drives the graphene to open a gap in the bulk spectrum@xcite , creates the edge states full filled in the gap when an edge is inserted , generates dirac cones protected by trs that is favorable to form a topological insulator . at last , we also show that the bias voltage on bg , as same as rashba soc , can change the energy spectrum through the deduction of the energy gap .",
    "but the interlayer rashba soc in bg destroy the topological phase of qshe through opening the gap in the band of edge state fulfilled in bulk gap region that is also unfavorable to the phase of topological insulator .",
    "thus we conclude that these factors are all not favorable to the formation of the topological insulator except the intrinsic soc .",
