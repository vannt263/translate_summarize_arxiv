    "the study of turbulent flows incorporating heavy particles in suspension ( particles with finite stopping times ) is an important endeavor that has both fundamental and practical relevance to many scientific and engineering problems .",
    "such flows have been investigated mainly in numerical simulations where detailed statistical analysis of the flow fields is possible @xcite these simulations , limited to relatively low taylor microscale reynolds numbers @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) , demonstrated that particles whose fluid response times are comparable to the lifetime of the smallest turbulent eddies produce a highly nonuniform field with intense regions of concentration .",
    "preliminary indications were that the feedback from such concentrations of particles could locally damp turbulence - however , the role of this  mass loading \" effect in determining the statistical distributions of particle density and various fluid scalars has not been thoroughly studied .",
    "experimental investigations of turbulence modification by particles have demonstrated that the degree of turbulence damping increases with particle mass loading and concentration @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon known as intermittency can be described as intense fluctuations , on small spatial and temporal scales in the turbulent field , that contribute to the exponential tails of probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) of scalars such as velocity increments and gradients @xcite , dissipation @xcite , pressure @xcite , enstrophy @xcite and velocity circulation @xcite .",
    "intermittency in the density field of preferentially concentrated particles has also been observed and studied @xcite .",
    "although intermittency in turbulence still lacks a complete theoretical understanding , progress has been made with phenomenological models that capture intermittency in a cascade process .",
    "richardson @xcite and later kolmogorov @xcite suggested that such models might be used to explain the process of eddy fragmentation initiated by unstable large scale structures in a turbulent fluid .",
    "intermittency in the context of fragmentation though a cascading process has been studied for large - scale gravitating masses @xcite and velocity increments in turbulence @xcite .",
    "simple cascade models were explored by meneveau and sreenivasan @xcite and were reviewed by sreenivasan and stolovitzky @xcite the scale similarity of random fields was explored by novikov @xcite , with a focus on the energy dissipation cascade . in novikov",
    "s work , the ratio of dissipation averaged over two spheres , one embedded within the other , served as a measure of enstrophy partitioning between larger and smaller scales .",
    "the probability distribution of these ratios , known as multipliers or breakdown coefficients , was shown to relate to multifractal and statistical measures ( moments ) of the velocity and dissipation fields",
    ". a recent review of intermittency in multiplicative cascades stresses that this theory is a kinematic description and its connection with the real dynamics remains unclear @xcite .",
    "our previous numerical study of particle concentration in turbulent flows showed that the particle density field is a multifractal on scales comparable to the kolmogorov length scale @xcite .",
    "this result suggests that a deeper description of the statistical properties of the particle concentration field , based on multiplier pdfs , may also be possible .",
    "analytical efforts have suggested that dissipation and vorticity in the fluid phase should be locally linked with particle concentration @xcite .",
    "numerical work in this regard has demonstrated that preferential concentration is statistically anticorrelated with low vorticity : particles tend to concentrate in regions where enstrophy is relatively weak @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present a cascade model in the spirit of novikov @xcite that follows the partitioning of positive definite scalars associated with both the fluid and the particles .",
    "multipliers controlling the partitioning of enstrophy and particle density at each step in the cascade are drawn from probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) which are determined empirically from direct numerical simulations ( dns ) . moreover ,",
    "the multiplier pdfs are _ dependent _ on , or conditioned by , the particle mass density or mass loading .",
    "the cascade model then generates joint pdfs for particle concentration and enstrophy at arbitrary cascade levels .",
    "a _ partitioning correlation probability _ is also applied at each cascade level to account for the observed spatial anticorrelation between enstrophy and particle concentration @xcite .    in section",
    "ii we describe the cascade model and its parameters , which are empirically determined from dns calculations .",
    "details of the dns equations , and our numerical methods , are discussed in the appendix .",
    "results are shown in section iii , including comparisons of joint pdfs of enstrophy and particle concentration as predicted by the cascade model with those obtained directly from the dns results",
    ". cascade model pdf predictions at reynolds numbers well beyond the dns values are also presented . in section iv",
    ", we summarize our results and discuss their implications .",
    "a turbulent cascade can be envisioned as an hierarchical breakdown of larger eddies into smaller ones that halts when the fluid viscosity alone can dissipate eddy kinetic energy .",
    "eddies or similar turbulent structures such as vortex tubes are bundles of energy containing vorticity and dissipation .",
    "these structures start with a size comparable to the integral scale @xmath4 of the flow , and break down in steps to a size comparable to the kolmogorov scale @xmath5 before being dissipated away by viscosity .",
    "the fluid vorticity and dissipation exhibit spatial fluctuations that increase in intensity as the spatial scale decreases .",
    "this phenonemon is known as intermittency and has been observed in a variety of processes with strong nonlinear interactions .    in previous numerical and experimental studies , locally averaged intermittent dissipation fields with scale at or near @xmath5 were used to quantify the statistical properties of multiplier distributions @xcite .",
    "multipliers are random variables that govern the partitioning of a positive definite scalar as turbulent structures break down along the cascade . in these studies the statistical distribution of multipliers ( their pdf ) were shown to be invariant over spatial scales that fall within the turbulent inertial range .",
    "multifractal properties of the cascading field are derivable from such multiplier distributions @xcite , and cascade models based on the iterative application of multipliers to a cascading variable have been shown to mimic intermittency .    while invariant with level in the inertial range of a cascade , multiplier pdfs might depend on local properties of the environment .",
    "for instance , sreenivasan and stolovitzky @xcite showed that the degree of intermittency in dissipation increases with the degree of local strain rate , and constructed multiplier distributions for local energy dissipation _ conditioned on _ the local strain rate .",
    "the physical mechanism behind this effect is believed to be related to vortex stretching dynamics creating intense bursts of dissipation .",
    "all the multiplier pdfs measured by sreenivasan and stolovitzky @xcite , whether conditioned or unconditioned by local properties , are well characterized by the @xmath1 distribution function , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the multiplier variable and @xmath1 is a shape controlling parameter .",
    "a large @xmath1 produces a narrow , delta - function - like curve centered at @xmath7 = 0.5 , whereas @xmath1 = 1 produces a flat distribution between @xmath7 = 0 and 1 .",
    "these limits for @xmath1 correspond to uniform and highly intermittent processes respectively . in conditioned multipliers ,",
    "the value of @xmath1 varies with some local property of the fluid .",
    "concentration of particles in turbulence is a result of the active dynamics of eddies on all scales .",
    "the process depends on the scale of the eddies and the corresponding particle response to those eddies .",
    "intense particle density fluctuations , akin to intermittency , were observed in a previous numerical study where it was also shown that nonuniform particle concentrations have multifractal scaling properties @xcite .",
    "these results strongly suggest that a phenomenological cascade model based on multipliers may adequately describe the particle density field .",
    "simulations that have included particle feedback on the fluid through the mass loading effect show that damping of local turbulence occurs @xcite .",
    "the latter have shown that vorticity dynamics is affected locally by particle feedback .",
    "this interplay between the phases could attenuate vortex stretching and , thereby , diminish local turbulent intermittency .",
    "multiplier distributions conditioned on local mass loading should therefore be an integral part of a realistic fluid - particle cascade model .",
    "below we describe a two - phase cascade model that incorporates simultaneous multiplier processes for particle concentration @xmath8 and fluid enstrophy @xmath9 , in addition to a process that models their spatial anticorrelation .",
    "the multiplier distributions are conditioned by the local particle concentration , as determined empirically from dns fields equilibrated to @xmath2 = 34 , 60 , 107 , and 170 .",
    "the spatial anticorrelation was also quantified from these fields .",
    "local measures of particle concentration ( @xmath8 ) and enstrophy ( @xmath9 ) used are defined in the appendix .    a schematic illustration of our two - phase partitioning process is shown in fig .",
    "the cascading vector @xmath10 has components representing enstrophy and particle concentration .",
    "initially the components are assigned the value unity and are associated with a common cell having a volume of unity .",
    "each component is partitioned into two parts ; @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , where @xmath13 are multipliers for @xmath9 and @xmath8 whose values are between zero and one inclusive and are random members of the corresponding multiplier distributions .",
    "the parts are associated with two daughter cells each containing half the volume of the starting cell . in the example shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are assumed to be greater than 0.5 .",
    "the largest parts of @xmath9 and @xmath8 are placed in the same daughter cell with probability @xmath16 ( and in different cells with probability @xmath17 ) .",
    "this partitioning process is repeated for each daughter cell down the cascade until the ratio of the daughter cell size to the initial cell size equals a specified cutoff .",
    "when this cutoff is set to the ratio of the turbulent lengthscales @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the cascade corresponds to turbulence characterized by @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "figure depicting the breakdown of a parcel of enstrophy ( @xmath9 ) and particle concentration ( @xmath8 ) into two parcels each with half the volume of the parent .",
    "the corresponding multipliers @xmath14 and @xmath15 are assumed to be greater than 0.5 in this figure .",
    "these measures are broken down and distributed between the two parcels in one of two ways - the larger portions are partitioned together with probability @xmath16= 0.3 ( upper figure ) , or in opposite directions with probability @xmath17= 0.7 ( lower figure ) .",
    ", width=307 ]      the parameters of the cascade model are empirically derived from the particle density and enstrophy fields @xmath8 and @xmath9 as calculated by dns ( see appendix ) .",
    "the simulation parameters for four dns runs representing @xmath2 = 36 , 60 , 104 , and 170 are shown in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the turbulence kinetic energy @xmath19 , the volume averaged dissipation @xmath20 , and @xmath4 are calculated from the 3-d turbulent energy spectrum @xmath21 and kinematic viscosity @xmath22 ,    @xmath23    @xmath24    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is wavenumber .",
    "@xmath27 times the number of computational nodes per side is the maximum effective wavenumber .",
    "thus @xmath28 indicates an adequate resolution of the kolmogorov scale .",

    "these diverse results might be reconciled since the particles we study herein are all far smaller than the kolmogorov scale and also have only a very small lag velocity relative to the gas . recall that we force the turbulence , as might be the case if it were being constantly forced by energetic sources operating on larger scales than our computational volume",
    ". however , fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] strongly suggests an upper limit for @xmath8 ( @xmath32 ) for both @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the cascade anticorrelation parameter @xmath16 was determined by counting the number of parent cells within which the larger partitions of @xmath8 and @xmath9 were found to share the same daughter cell .",
    "this number divided by the total number of parent cells defines @xmath16 .",
    "the derived @xmath16 value is approximately constant across the dns cases , as indicated in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "operationally , the @xmath16 used in the cascade model was determined by taking a simple average of the @xmath16 values in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "overall , the invariance of @xmath16 and the @xmath35 and @xmath36 functions across our range of @xmath2 justifies their treatment as level independent parameters in the two - phase cascade model .",
    "one caveat remains , which would be of interest to address in future work .",
    "while it _ has _ been shown that multiplier distributions leading to @xmath34 and @xmath33 are level - invariant over a range of scales within an inertial range  @xcite , our simulations were numerically restricted to values of @xmath37 in which the inertial range has not yet become fully developed .",
    "our reliance on the smallest available scales of 3@xmath5 to 1.5@xmath5 ( those providing the largest available intermittency ) might lead to some concern that they were already sampling the _ dissipation _ range of our calculations , and thus may not be appropriate for a cascade code .",
    "we tested this possibility by calculating multipliers for the next largest level bifurcation ( 6@xmath5 to 3@xmath5 ) for the @xmath38 case .",
    "the @xmath1 values for those multiplier distributions are slightly larger in value , but consistent with the @xmath8-dependence shown in fig .",
    "( 6@xmath5 scales do nt provide good distribution functions beyond @xmath39 15 ) .",
    "thus we believe that for the purpose of demonstrating this technique , and for the purpose of estimating the occurrence statistics of @xmath8 under particle mass loading , our results are satisfactory . for applications requiring quantitatively detailed and/or more accurate @xmath40 , it would certainly be of interest to extend the dns calculations to larger @xmath37 , at which a true inertial range might be found .",
    "the 2d joint probability distribution function or pdf of concentration and enstrophy , a fractional volume measure , was generated from the cascade model and compared with results derived directly from numerical dns simulations .",
    "the basic probability density @xmath40 gives the fractional volume occupied by cells having enstrophy @xmath9 and concentration @xmath8 , per unit @xmath9 and @xmath8 ; thus the fractional volume having @xmath8 and @xmath9 in some range @xmath41 is @xmath42 . for quantities varying over orders of magnitude ,",
    "it is convenient to adopt @xmath43 and @xmath44 , and we will present the results in the form @xmath45 .    we started by binning results at spatial scale @xmath46 , obtained from the semi - final level of a cascade model run , into a uniform logarithmic grid of @xmath47 bins each having width @xmath48 , with corresponding values of @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the number of @xmath46 cells accumulated in each bin was normalized by the total number of such cells in the sample to convert it to a fractional volume @xmath51 .",

    "<S> a cascade model is described based on multiplier distributions determined from 3d direct numerical simulations ( dns ) of turbulent particle laden flows , which include two - way coupling between the phases at global mass loadings equal to unity . </S>",
    "<S> the governing eulerian equations are solved using psuedo - spectral methods on up to @xmath0 computional grid points . </S>",
    "<S> dns results for particle concentration and enstrophy at taylor microscale reynolds numbers in the range 34 - 170 were used to directly determine multiplier distributions on spatial scales 3 times the kolmogorov length scale . </S>",
    "<S> the multiplier probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) are well characterized by the @xmath1 distribution function . </S>",
    "<S> the width of the pdfs , which is a measure of intermittency , decreases with increasing mass loading within the local region where the multipliers are measured . </S>",
    "<S> the functional form of this dependence is not sensitive to reynolds numbers in the range considered . </S>",
    "<S> a partition correlation probability is included in the cascade model to account for the observed spatial anticorrelation between particle concentration and enstrophy . </S>",
    "<S> joint probability distribution functions of concentration and enstrophy generated using the cascade model are shown to be in excellent agreement with those derived directly from our 3d simulations . </S>",
    "<S> probabilities predicted by the cascade model are presented at reynolds numbers well beyond what is achievable by direct simulation . </S>",
    "<S> these results clearly indicate that particle mass loading significantly reduces the probabilities of high particle concentration and enstrophy relative to those resulting from unloaded runs . </S>",
    "<S> particle mass density appears to reach a limit at around 100 times the gas density . </S>",
    "<S> this approach has promise for significant computational savings in certain applications . </S>"
