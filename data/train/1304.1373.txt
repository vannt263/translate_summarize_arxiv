    "longitudinal double - spin asymmetries in inclusive and semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering have been prime sources of information on the nucleon s spin structure for several decades .",
    "they may be used to extract the helicity parton distributions of the nucleon , [ ppdf ] f(x , q^2)f^+(x , q^2)-f^-(x , q^2 )  , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the distributions of parton @xmath3 with positive and negative helicity , respectively , when the parent nucleon has positive helicity .",
    "@xmath0 denotes the momentum fraction of the parton and @xmath4 the hard scale at which the distribution is probed .",
    "inclusive polarized deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) , @xmath5 , offers access to the combined quark and antiquark distributions for a given flavor , @xmath6 , whereas in semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( sidis ) , @xmath7 , one exploits the fact that a produced hadron @xmath8 ( like a @xmath9 ) may for instance have a quark of a certain flavor as a valence quark , but not the corresponding antiquark  @xcite . in this way , it becomes possible to separate quark and antiquark distributions in the nucleon from one another , as well as to better determine the distributions for the various flavors .",
    "hermes  @xcite and recent compass  @xcite measurements have marked significant progress concerning the accuracy and kinematic coverage of polarized sidis measurements .",

    "the focus will be on the large-@xmath0 regime .",
    "a good understanding of the theoretical framework for the description of spin asymmetries in lepton scattering is vital for a reliable extraction of polarized parton distributions . in a recent paper  @xcite we have investigated the effects of qcd threshold resummation on hadron multiplicities in sidis in the hermes and compass kinematic regimes .",
    "sidis is characterized by two scaling variables , bjorken-@xmath0 and a variable @xmath10 given by the energy of the produced hadron over the energy of the virtual photon in the target rest frame .",
    "large logarithmic corrections to the sidis cross section arise when the corresponding partonic variables become large , corresponding to scattering near a phase space boundary , where real - gluon emission is suppressed .",
    "this is typically the case for the presently relevant fixed - target kinematics .",
    "threshold resummation addresses these logarithms to all orders in the strong coupling . in  @xcite",
    "we found fairly significant resummation effects on the spin - averaged multiplicities . since the spin - dependent cross section is subject to similar logarithmic corrections as the unpolarized one , it is worthwhile to explore the effects of resummation on the spin asymmetries .",
    "this is the goal of the present paper .",

    "any difference between the solid and dashed lines is , therefore , a measure of the significance of effects related to strange quarks and antiquarks , and to nlo corrections .",
    "as one can see , these have relatively modest size .",

    "<S> we explore the effects of the resummation of large logarithmic perturbative corrections to double - longitudinal spin asymmetries for inclusive and semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering in fixed - target experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the asymmetries are overall rather robust with respect to the inclusion of the resummed higher - order terms . </S>",
    "<S> significant effects are observed at fairly high values of @xmath0 , where resummation tends to decrease the spin asymmetries . </S>",
    "<S> this effect turns out to be more pronounced for semi - inclusive scattering . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate the potential impact of resummation on the extraction of polarized valence quark distributions in dedicated high-@xmath0 experiments . </S>"
