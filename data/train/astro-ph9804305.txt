    "zz cetis , also called davs , are variable white dwarfs with hydrogen atmospheres .",
    "their photometric variations are associated with nonradial gravity - modes ( g - modes ) ; for the first conclusive proof , see robinson ( @xcite ) .",
    "these stars have shallow surface convection zones overlying stably stratified interiors . as the result of gravitational settling ,",
    "different elements are well separated . with increasing depth , the composition changes from hydrogen to helium , and then in most cases to a mixture of carbon and oxygen . from center",
    "to surface the luminosity is carried first by electron conduction , then by radiative diffusion , and finally by convection .",
    "our aim is to describe the mechanism responsible for the overstability of g - modes in zz ceti stars .",
    "this topic has received attention in the past .",
    "initial calculations of overstable modes were presented in dziembowski & koester ( @xcite ) , dolez & vauclair ( @xcite ) , and winget ( @xcite ) .",
    "these were based on the assumption that the convective flux does not respond to pulsation ; this is often referred to as the frozen convection hypothesis . because hydrogen is partially ionized in the surface layers of zz ceti stars , these workers attributed mode excitation to the @xmath11-mechanism . in so doing , they ignored the fact that the thermal time - scale in the layer of partial ionization is many orders of magnitude smaller than the periods of the overstable modes . pesnell ( @xcite ) pointed out that in calculations such as those just referred to , mode excitation results from the outward decay of the perturbed radiative flux at the bottom of the convective envelope .",
    "he coined the term ` convective blocking ' for this excitation mechanism .",
    "although convective blocking is responsible for mode excitation in the above cited references , it does not occur in the convective envelopes of zz ceti stars .",
    "this is because the dynamic time - scale for convective readjustment ( i.e. , convective turn - over time ) in these stars is much shorter than the g - mode periods .",
    "noting this , brickhill ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) assumed that convection responds instantaneously to the pulsational state .",
    "he demonstrated that this leads to a new type of mode excitation , which he referred to as convective driving .",
    "brickhill went on to presents the first physically consistent calculations of mode overstability , mode visibility , and instability strip width .",
    "our investigation supports most of his conclusions .",
    "additional support for convective driving is provided by gautschy ( @xcite ) who found overstable modes in calculations in which convection is modeled by hydrodynamic simulation .    in this paper",
    "we elucidate the manner in which instantaneous convective adjustment promotes mode overstability .",
    "we adopt the quasiadiabatic approximation in the radiative interior .",
    "we also ignore the effects of turbulent viscosity in the convection zone .",
    "these simplifications enable us to keep our investigation analytical , although we appeal to numerically computed stellar models and eigenfunctions for guidance .",

    "fully nonadiabatic results , which require numerical computations , will be reported in a subsequent paper .",

    "the plan of our paper is as follows .",
    "the linearized wave equation is derived in  [ sec : adia - prepare ] . in  [ sec : adia - perturb ] , we evaluate the perturbations associated with a g - mode in different parts of the star .",

    "the time - averaged magnitude of the vertical component of @xmath232 , computed to lowest order in @xmath233 with the aid of equations and , is found to be @xmath234 which is in accord with the wkb amplitude relation .",
    "yet another way to look at the energy flux is as the energy density transported by the group velocity .",
    "the energy density may be approximated as @xmath235 , since kinetic energy contributes half the time - averaged total energy density , and @xmath236 which reproduces the result for @xmath237 given by equation .",
    "the lamb frequency , @xmath30 , decreases with increasing @xmath34 , whereas the frequency , @xmath31 , increases until it drops abruptly just below the convection zone and becomes imaginary within it ( cf .",
    "1 ) . compositional transitions may be exceptions to these trends .",
    "the wkb approximation is violated if these transitions are sharp on the scale of the radial wavelength .",
    "when these are located in regions of propagation , they are best viewed as separating linked cavities .",
    "we divide a star s g - modes into two classes , high frequency modes and low frequency modes .",

    "more generally , @xmath246 for @xmath210 .",
    "expressions for @xmath44 and @xmath45 are given by equations ( [ eq : adia - xih ] ) and ( [ eq : adia - xiz ] ) .",
    "to leading order in @xmath247 , these reduce to @xmath248 and @xmath249 where @xmath250 , we have @xmath251 , which implies @xmath252 . in these regions",
    "g - modes are characterized by nearly horizontal motions .",
    "equations ( [ eq : adia - xihc ] ) and ( [ eq : adia - xizc ] ) imply that @xmath253 vanishes to leading order in @xmath222 .",
    "thus g - modes are relatively incompressible within their cavities .",
    "a more precise estimate , obtained from equation , is @xmath254 .      for the purpose of this discussion",

    "taking into account the near constancy of @xmath53 , equations ( [ eq : adia - xih ] ) and ( [ eq : adia - xiz ] ) imply that to leading order in @xmath262 , @xmath263 and @xmath264 thus both components of the displacement vector are nearly constant for @xmath265 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath266 is more subtle ; in principle , it could vary on scale @xmath35 should @xmath267 do so .",
    "however , in practice , @xmath267 exhibits only mild depth variations .",
    "thus , equation ( [ eq : adia - xihe ] ) yields @xmath268 equation ( [ eq : adia - incompp ] ) shows that the relative incompressibility that characterizes propagating g - modes does not extend to their evanescent tails .",
    "the global dispersion relation is obtained from @xmath269 where @xmath270 is the lower boundary of the mode cavity .",

    "this relation is a good approximation to the g - mode dispersion relation for a polytropic atmosphere .",
    "the proportionality ^2 [ eq : adia - scaling - nl ] provides a satisfactory fit to the high frequency modes in dav white dwarfs . however , low frequency modes penetrate deeply into the interior where the approximation @xmath273 fails because of electron degeneracy ( cf . fig .",

    "<S> we analyze the stability of g - modes in variable white dwarfs with hydrogen envelopes . </S>",
    "<S> all the relevant physical processes take place in the outer layer of hydrogen rich material which consists of a radiative layer overlain by a convective envelope . </S>",
    "<S> the radiative layer contributes to mode damping because its opacity decreases upon compression and the amplitude of the lagrangian pressure perturbation increases outward . </S>",
    "<S> the convective envelope is the seat of mode excitation because it acts as an insulating blanket with respect to the perturbed flux that enters it from below . </S>",
    "<S> a crucial point is that the convective motions respond to the instantaneous pulsational state . </S>",
    "<S> driving exceeds damping by as much as a factor of two provided @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the radian frequency of the mode and @xmath2 with @xmath3 being the thermal time constant evaluated at the base of the convective envelope . as a white dwarf cools , its convection zone deepens , and modes of lower frequency become overstable . </S>",
    "<S> however , the deeper convection zone impedes the passage of flux perturbations from the base of the convection zone to the photosphere . </S>",
    "<S> thus the photometric variation of a mode with constant velocity amplitude decreases . </S>",
    "<S> these factors account for the observed trend that longer period modes are found in cooler davs . </S>",
    "<S> overstable modes have growth rates of order @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the mode s radial order and @xmath6 is the thermal time - scale evaluated at the top of the mode s cavity . </S>",
    "<S> the growth time , @xmath7 , ranges from hours for the longest period observed modes ( @xmath8 minutes ) to thousands of years for those of shortest period ( @xmath9 minutes ) . </S>",
    "<S> the linear growth time probably sets the time - scale for variations of mode amplitude and phase . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with observations showing that longer period modes are more variable than shorter period ones . </S>",
    "<S> our investigation confirms many results obtained by brickhill in his pioneering studies of zz cetis . </S>",
    "<S> however , it suffers from at least two serious shortcomings . </S>",
    "<S> it is based on the quasiadiabatic approximation that strictly applies only in the limit @xmath10 , and it ignores damping associated with turbulent viscosity in the convection zone . </S>",
    "<S> we will remove these shortcomings in future papers .    </S>",
