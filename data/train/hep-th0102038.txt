    "( we shall refer to these theories as seiberg - witten ( sw ) theories ) .",
    "this classification falls into an ade pattern , and the type of singularity gives the global symmetry of the corresponding theory .",
    "there are @xmath10 and @xmath11 singularities at i m @xmath12 , as well as a @xmath4 singularity that can occur at all values of @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore , there are six singularities at finite values of @xmath9 , of types @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath0 .",
    "hence there are precisely seven strongly coupled superconformal theories , with global symmetries equal to the corresponding singularity type ( see also @xcite ) . of these theories",
    "the latter three have no lagrangian description , which makes them difficult to study .    however , a possible way to sidestep this difficulty appeared when @xcite found the remarkable fact that the generalised coulomb branches of the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 theories are identical to the higgs branches of other , a priori completely different gauge theories .",
    "these gauge theories , which we will call _ quiver _ theories , are four - dimensional n=2 supersymmetric yang - mills theories with gauge and matter content that may be described by an ade dynkin diagram ( or , rather , a _ quiver _ diagram ) .",
    "this dynkin diagram is precisely that of the ade global symmetry of the corresponding sw theory .",
    "the authors of @xcite extended the analysis to the @xmath6 case and , encouraged by these results , proposed the existence of a mirror symmetry between four - dimensional sw theories and quiver gauge theories , analogous to the mirror symmetry acting on three - dimensional gauge theories @xcite .",
    "the mirror symmetry would exchange the generalised coulomb branch of one theory with the higgs branch of the other , and would provide a map between mass parameters of one theory and fayet - iliopoulos parameters of the other .",
    "since the coulomb branch receives quantum corrections but the higgs branch does not , one consequence of the mirror symmetry is that quantum effects in one theory arise classically in the dual theory , and vice versa .    in this paper , we show the remaining moduli space identity , i.e.  for the @xmath0 case , thus exhausting the set of sw theories . we also derive , at least implictly , the map between mass and fayet - iliopoulos parameters for the @xmath0 case .",
    "the quiver gauge theory can be realised as the worldvolume theory of a d3-brane probing an orbifold singularity , and in section [ sec : quiver ] we derive the gauge and matter content from such a setup , showing how to describe it by means of a quiver diagram . in section [ sec : e8curve ] we construct the curve describing the higgs branch , expressed in gauge group invariants and fayet - iliopoulos parameters . in section [ sec : hwpicture ] we attempt a deeper understanding of the quiver theory in terms of the hanany - witten picture @xcite , and finally , section [ sec : conclusions ] contains a summary and discussion .",

    "depending on the choice of @xmath15 , the resulting quiver theory will be associated with a dynkin diagram of type @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 or @xmath0 , respectively .",

    "the sum of the full set of 2-cycles is homologically trivial and can be shrunk to zero size .",
    "then the collection of wrapped d5-branes will look like a single d3-brane that can move around freely in the orbifold .",
    "this procedure corresponds in the hw picture to starting out with a single d4-brane stretching between two of the @xmath104 ns5-branes , and wanting to move the d4-brane ( in the 7-direction , say ) away from the ns5-branes , detaching its ends . in order not to violate the boundary conditions of the d4-brane",

    "the d4-brane may now be lifted off the ns5-branes and move freely , corresponding to the free d3-brane in the t - dual picture .",
    "we may also gain some insight concerning the role played by the fi parameters in the hw picture , from the worldvolume theory of a wrapped d5-brane on the orbifold singularity .",

    "dimensional reduction to the 0123 directions , by integrating over the 2-cycle , puts the first term of ( [ eq : d5action ] ) on the form @xmath149 where @xmath150 , @xmath151 is the metric on the 67 directions , and @xmath152 is the metric on the 0123 directions . expanding ( [ eq : d5bired ] ) we obtain the coupling constant @xmath153 in four dimensions as the coefficient of @xmath154 .",

    "assume that one is contemplating a hw picture of ns5-branes with d4-branes ending on them and that this is supposed to describe the iia t - dual of d3-branes on an ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 or ) @xmath0 singularity in iib .",
    "moving the ns5-branes in the hw picture corresponds to blowing up the singularity in the dual picture . as discussed in section [ sec : hwpicture ] , the fi parameters give the position of the ns5-branes in the hw picture when they are moved . since we have given the relation of the fi parameters to the parameters governing the deformation of the algebraic variety , one may now check that the possible motions on the hw side ( allowed by the particular geometry suggested ) correspond to the known allowed deformations .",
    "we have performed the above check for some of the known dualities and hope to use it in future efforts to find hw pictures of the @xmath175-theories .",
    "finally we mention that all is set up for finding the remaining trace identities in appendix [ sec : traceids ] .",
    "the calculations will be carried out as soon as the computer capacity becomes available to us .",

    "the @xmath0 casimir invariants may be expressed in terms of fundamental weights as shown in section [ sec : e8curve ] .",
    "the weights may in turn be expressed in terms of the @xmath0 simple roots . here",
    ", the procedure is quite general . ]",
    "we want to find the 248 weights of the fundamental representation of @xmath0 .",
    "this is the same as the adjoint representation , and it is real , whence half of the weights are just minus the first half .",
    "in addition one finds that eight of them are zero , so we end up with only 120 nonvanishing independent weights .    viewing the simple roots @xmath83 as 8-vectors , the cartan matrix for @xmath0 , @xmath176 may be viewed as the matrix of scalar products @xmath177 .",

    "iterating this procedure , subtracting simple roots whose scalar products with the previous weight are positive , we obtain 120 nonvanishing weights @xmath183 in `` cartan representation '' . to express these in terms of simple roots , we invert the cartan matrix and compute @xmath122 as @xmath184 where @xmath185 denotes the @xmath186:th component of the vector @xmath183 , @xmath89 is the inverse of the cartan matrix , and the factor 2 is a normalisation .    note the slight change in convention ; all the @xmath83 s here have the same sign , whereas two of our fi terms in section [ sec : e8curve ] ( @xmath187 and @xmath188 ) have opposite sign relative to the others .      the traces",

    "for @xmath0 we found the following identities , @xmath190 although straightforward in principle , due to limitations of maple , we were not able to derive the rest of the trace identities , i.e.  those expressing @xmath191 , @xmath192 , @xmath193 and @xmath194 in terms of the independent @xmath195 s .",
