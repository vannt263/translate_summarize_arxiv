    "the dark energy camera , decam , is a 570 mpixel , 2.2-degree field - of - view camera currently installed and operating as a survey and community instrument on the 4-meter victor m. blanco telescope at the cerro tololo inter american observatory ( ctio ) .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : camerasideview ] .",
    "decam was designed and constructed by the dark energy survey ( des ) collaboration with the primary goal of studying the nature of dark energy using four complementary probes : galaxy clusters , weak lensing , type ia supernovae and baryon acoustic oscillations . in exchange for the camera ,",
    "the des collaboration was allocated 105 nights per year of telescope time over the next 5 years to perform a deep and wide photometric survey of the southern galactic cap .",
    "this dark energy survey consists of a wide field survey of 5000 sq .",
    "a 30 sq . deg .",
    "area for detection of supernovae .",
    "the survey field was designed to include complete overlap with the sz cluster survey area covered by the south pole telescope  @xcite ( spt ) to provide additional constraints on the clusters measured by both surveys",
    ". it also overlaps with part of sdss  @xcite stripe 82 to provide tight constraints on the survey photometric calibration .",
    "des will obtain photometric redshifts out to redshift of @xmath3 for over 300 million galaxies , 100,000 galaxy clusters and about 3000 type ia sne .",
    "des represents an increase in volume over sdss by roughly a factor of 7 . in the parlance of the dark energy task force  @xcite ,",
    "des is a stage iii project and will improve the dark energy task force figure of merit , the area of the ellipse formed by the un - excluded limits of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , by a factor of 3 - 5 over stage 2 projects .",
    "the high level requirements on the decam design were driven by the need to survey a 5000 sq .",
    "area in a total of 525 nights , with excellent image quality , high sensitivity in the near infrared , and low readout noise . to meet these requirements",
    "the new camera has a 3 sq .",
    "field of view , a new 5 lens optical corrector , and 250-micron thick fully - depleted red - sensitive ccds .",
    "photometric redshifts are obtained using 5 filters ( g , r , i , z , and y - band ) that span the wavelength range from 400 - 1065 nm .",
    "the focal plane includes 62 of the @xmath6 ccds that are used for imaging , and 12 smaller format @xmath7 ccds for guiding and focus / alignment .",
    "the five lens optical corrector is supported in a steel barrel and mounted to the prime focus cage with a hexapod that provides focus , lateral positioning , and tip / tilt capabilities .",
    "figure [ fig : cage ] shows a schematic of decam in the new prime focus cage .",
    "the shutter and filter changer are located between the 3rd and 4th lenses .",
    "the ccds are cooled with a closed loop liquid nitrogen system and housed in a vacuum vessel mounted to the corrector barrel .",
    "the fifth lens of the corrector also serves as the window of the vessel .",
    "the ccd electronics are housed in thermally controlled crates mounted to the ccd vessel .",
    "the prime focus cage was redesigned to provide greater stiffness and other features specific to decam while maintaining the ability to support operations with a secondary mirror providing a cassegrain focus , as an alternative to decam .",
    "funding for the decam construction was provided primarily by the department of energy , with significant contributions from international partners and us universities .",
    "the des collaboration formed in 2004 and began r&d as well as the review and approval processes of the various agencies and funding sources . in 2007 decam received funding from stfc ( uk ) and in 2008 the project received approval from doe to initiate construction . in 2012 decam was completed and installed on the blanco telescope , with first light in september 2012 .",
    "this paper describes the decam design and construction , testing and performance in the lab and the installation at the prime focus of the blanco 4 m telescope .",
    "some of the experiences gained during the first year of operations are also included .",
    "the decam on - sky performance will be covered in detail in a forthcoming publication .",
    "the sections below will follow the path of the light through decam .",
    "section 2 describes the optical corrector including the lenses , filters , and support structure .",
    "section 3 describes the filter changer , shutter , and active optics system .",
    "section 4 provides details about the focal plane detectors , which are charge - coupled devices ( ccds ) .",
    "section 5 describes the readout electronics .",
    "section 6 describes the camera structure and infrastructure , including the prime focus cage .",
    "section 7 describes the system controls , and the observer and telescope interfaces .",
    "section 8 covers systems external to the camera such as the calibration system , and the auxiliary systems .",
    "section 9 discusses the integration and installation , including the initial camera performance . in each section",
    "we provide the present status of the systems and note where there have been improvements or other changes since the original construction .",
    "the des science goals require a large area survey with accurate photometry of faint sources in g- , r- , i- , and z - bands as well as accurate shape measurements  @xcite , particularly in r - band and i - band . to meet these goals the decam optical system",
    "was designed  @xcite to have a wide field of view , high throughput over wavelength range 400 - 1000 nm and good image quality  @xcite over the entire field of view . in addition , the design also had to satisfy tight budget constraints , and accommodate an aggressive construction schedule requiring that fabrication risks be minimized .",
    "figure  [ fig : decamzemax ] shows the overall optical design .",
    "fused silica was chosen as the material for all 5 lenses to provide good performance over the full wavelength range required for des while also providing good performance in the u - band .",
    "only one of the four filter positions is shown in the figure , but all were used in the ghosting analysis and the lens optimization .",
    "the design is nearly achromatic for @xmath8 nm . the smallest lens , c5 , is curved into the vacuum vessel providing field flattening and minimizing ghosting , and it functions as the vacuum vessel window .",
    "this section will describe the design and as - built results for the lenses and coatings , the cells that provide the interface between the lenses and the barrel , the filters and the barrel as well as the overall assembly and alignment .    .",
    "]        the field of view of the camera was specified at 2.2 degrees in diameter based on the desired survey area , the available observing time , and the specification for the image qualty .",
    "it may have been possible to specify a corrector with a larger field of view and good image quality by using a larger c1 and/or more aspheric lenses , but that would have entailed higher costs and greater manufacturing risks .",
    "the focal ratio at prime focus of the blanco 4-meter telescope is f/2.7 ( 52 @xmath0m / arcsec ) .",
    "the optical designs that we explored fell naturally into the range f/2.9f/3.0 ( 56 - 57@xmath0m / arcsec ) , slightly slower than the primary mirror .",
    "this pixel scale was designed to be well - matched to the expected image quality ; 2 pixels corresponds to 0.52fwhm , which is roughly the convolution of the best quartile of seeing at ctio ( @xmath9fwhm ) convolved with the as  built performance goal of the optics alone ( @xmath10 fwhm , see below ) .",
    "note that the typical best quartile of realized image quality of the previous prime focus camera ( mosaic ii ) at the blanco over a 0.6@xmath11 diameter field in the r - band filter was 0.89with a median of 0.99  @xcite .",
    "the goal for the _ as_-_built _ contribution ( including lens sag , alignment errors , etc ... ) to the fwhm for decam optics was 0.33   fwhm , or 18 @xmath0 m .",
    "the goal for the _ as_-_designed _ image quality is 0.27  fwhm , or 15@xmath0 m . for gaussian images , this corresponds to an rms radius of @xmath12 m . note that @xmath13 fwhm = 0.60 fwhm for a 2d gaussian .",
    "the 80% encircled energy radius is r80=0.76 fwhm , so that the @xmath14 r80 .",
    "the optical prescription for decam was optimized for the wavelength range 400 nm to 1000 nm with four filters with nominal wavelength ranges : g - band ( 400550 nm ) , r - band ( 560710 nm ) , i - band ( 700850 nm ) , and z - band ( 8301000 nm ) .",
    "after the optical design was finalized , des added a y - band ( 9501065 nm ) filter to the decam system primarily for the identification of high - redshift quasars .",
    "this addition did not impact the optical design .",
    "weak gravitational lensing measurements will be made primarily in r- , i- , and z - bands .",
    "the image quality has therefore been optimized to favor these bands to the extent that it is possible without violating the requirements in g - band .",
    "the best image quality for weak lensing is delivered by optimizing the camera for the smallest rms image sizes .",
    "accordingly , the images were quantified in terms of the average rms image size uniformly weighted over the full field .",
    "fused silica , which also has high transmission into the u - band , was the preferred material for the lenses because of the excellent homogeneity and because it has a negligible residual radioactivity ( making it particularly suitable for the dewar vacuum window ) .",
    "while it is not of primary interest to des , the u - band is of interest to the astronomy user community and ctio contributed a u - band filter . as the image quality optimization included a compromise between the blue and red image quality , adequate imaging",
    "is also achieved while using the u - band filter .",
    "although u - band images are noticeably worse than in the g - band , they do still have @xmath15 ( 0.17fwhm ) over the full field of view of the previous corrector on the blanco ( 0.6@xmath11 diameter ) , and so represent an improvement in image quality ( 0.250.5 ) over the previous corrector . in march 2014 a vr - band ( 500 to 760 nm ) filter was purchased by ctio and added to decam .",
    "this filter is primarily of interest to those searching for or studying objects in our solar system .",
    "accurate photometry requires accurate flat fielding .",
    "a predictable complication for prime focus cameras in this regard is the pupil ghosting . without coating ,",
    "the reflective loss at a single lens surface is @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the indices of refraction for the lens material and for air .",
    "because fused silica has an index of refraction of @xmath19 at optical wavelengths , the reflective losses for each lens in the decam corrector would be @xmath20 .",
    "an example of such ghosting and its mitigation using surface coatings is described  @xcite for the mayall prime focus camera . to mitigate against light loss we required that the reflectance be less than 1.5% in the wavelength range 340 to 1080 nm and less than 1.2% in the wavelength range 480 to 690 nm . the non - uniformity was required to be less than 0.7% . to mitigate the data - reduction problem introduced by ghosting",
    ", we required that the gradient in the pupil ghost intensity must be smaller than 3% across the long dimension of one ccd ( 61 mm , or 0.3 degrees ) .    to reduce the ghosting",
    ", all lens surfaces apart from those of c1 were coated by the polishing vendor .",
    "the coatings were chosen to minimize pupil and stellar images ghosting , and to maximize throughput . also required",
    "was that the coatings must be mechanically robust and not degrade in the environmental conditions each lens will encounter over the expected lifetime of the instrument .",
    "c1 was not coated because of a combination of the difficulty of identifying a vendor who would guarantee sufficient uniformity of the coating for a lens of that size and depth of curvature and the risk incurred from additional shipping of the lens .      to minimize figure errors and improve mechanical robustness ( therefore reducing fabrication cost and risk ) , a minimum aspect ratio of 1:10 ( axial thickness : lens diameter ) was chosen .",
    "thicker elements were allowed when driven by the image quality .",
    "c2 was near the critical thickness limit for a blank fabricated by standard methods .",
    "indeed , c1 proved to be even thicker and was slumped after casting to achieve the necessary curvature .",
    "the design includes two aspheric surfaces .",
    "the figure and placement of these elements was constrained based on feedback from several vendors .",
    "the most important characteristic regarding fabrication was not the total deviation from the best - fitted sphere , but rather the slope in this quantity with radius .",
    "we limited this slope to 1mm/50 mm , which the vendors indicated was in the range that would be straightforward to fabricate .",
    "different vendors indicated preferences for testing concave and convex aspheres , but all vendors suggested that both are readily fabricated and tested in elements similar to those discussed here . note that here we used the phrase  best - fitted spherical deviation \" in the practical sense of the millimeters of material that one would need to remove from the glass after figuring the surface to the best fitting spherical approximation .",
    "the surfaces were finished and tested at thales seso  @xcite .",
    "the baseline optical design for decam is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : decamzemax ] . the optical prescription for the camera",
    "is given in table  [ tab - zemax ] .",
    "the effective focal ratio is f/3.0 .",
    "the pixel scale is 56.88 @xmath0 m per arcsecond at the center of the focal plane and 57.12 @xmath0 m per arcsecond at the edge .",
    "this scale was not constrained during the optimization .",

    "m1 refers to the primary mirror .",
    "the sign convention is that of zemax , whereby distance along the optical axis in the direction of ray propagation is positive from the object to the primary mirror and negative after reflection off the mirror .",
    "the optically clear radii of the lenses are about 15 mm smaller than the lens radii ( shown in the table ) to avoid edge effects from polishing . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      in order to provide a cross - check of the amount of precipitable water vapor ( pwv ) in the atmosphere , des has supplied a high - precision dual - band global positioning system ( gps ) .",
    "pwv causes a shift in arrival time of the gps signal via the increased index of refraction  @xcite . a trimble netr9 gnss receiver and gps antenna mounted on the exterior of the 1.5-meter telescope building on ctio has sufficient sensitivity to provide a pwv measurement .",
    "the data are collected 24 hours per day and sent to a centralized suominet processing center .",
    "pwv results are made public within a few days .",
    "the atmospheric transmission monitoring camera ( atmcam ) is a new calibration system designed to enable the improved photometric calibration of data acquired by the decam .",
    "atmcam is housed in a new dome on the ctio summit and consists of a paramount telescope mount and four small telescopes ( commercial photographic camera lenses ) and ccd detectors each with a different narrow - band filter that monitor the brightness of suitable standard stars throughout the night .",
    "each narrowband filter is selected to monitor a different wavelength region of the atmospheric transmission , including regions dominated by the precipitable water vapor and aerosol optical depth .",
    "the colors of the stars are measured by this multi narrow - band imager system simultaneously .",
    "the measured colors , a model of the observed star , and the measured throughput of the system can be used to derive the atmospheric transmission of the site on sub - minute time scales . a full description of the atmcam system can be found in refs .   @xcite .",
    "the assembly of the camera required coordination between all of the members of the camera and telescope project teams .",
    "while the final installation at ctio took place in 2011 and 2012 , the planning and preparations began well before that .",
    "the work was challenging and was done with a great deal of review and care .",
    "this section presents a summary .      as part of the preparations for decam",
    ", ctio undertook improvements  @xcite to the infrastructure and the telescope facility .",
    "the major elements of that are described .",
    "the telescope s primary mirror has 24 radial supports equally - spaced around the edge and glued into place . these supports provide a counterweight that holds the primary mirror in the center of the mirror cell even as the telescope is moved in declination .",
    "a longstanding problem was that the supports broke away from the mirror at a rate of one or two a year .",
    "when that happened the mirror tended to have unpredictable lateral movements .",
    "these supports were redesigned so that they would not peel away from the mirror .",
    "they were all replaced in 2009 .",
    "the mirror has has had repeatable movements since that time , now compensated - for by motions of the hexapod .",
    "the primary mirror was re - aluminized in march 2009 .",
    "the blanco computer room and control rooms on the ground floor were both relocated , enlarged , and modernized .",
    "the new rooms have raised floors and active temperature control .",
    "the new rooms were commissioned in april 2011 .",
    "a 15 by 20 enclosed clean room was installed in the coud room on the main floor of the telescope dome . a new telescope control system ( tcs )",
    "was installed  @xcite in 2011 so as to remove obsolete components .",
    "an area in the ground floor garage space was converted into a dust - free space suitable for final assembly of the cage and corrector and the integration with the hexapod .",
    "this included the addition of a 15-ton overhead crane .",
    "the roof of the old control room on the upper level of the dome was reinforced so that it could support the camera s ln2 tank .",
    "a new 40 t glycol chiller was installed outside of the dome and the glycol circulation system was upgraded .",
    "a new air compressor and dessicator was installed for those systems that require dry compressed air .",
    "decam was first assembled and tested at fermilab on a full - scale reproduction of the telescope top - rings and fins that we called the  telescope simulator \"  @xcite .",
    "the telescope simulator had pitch and roll capability allowing us to position the camera in any orientation that it might meet on the blanco .",
    "a copy of ctio s secondary mirror handling  northwest \" platform was manufactured and converted into the imager handling system for decam .",
    "a new f/8 handling system and platform was designed at argonne national laboratory , necessary because the blanco s inner top - end ring would no longer be able to pivot 180 degrees on its axle ( thus facing the f/8 mirror towards the primary mirror ) after decam was installed .",
    "the initial use for the telescope simulator was to develop the procedures for using the f/8 handling system to install and remove a dummy f/8 mirror and the counterweight that is normally mounted on the bottom of the of prime focus cage when the f/8 is not in place there .",
    "the new f/8 platform was the first component of the decam project that was sent to ctio .",
    "it was installed in the dome during january 2011 .",
    "next the simulator was used to develop the cage installation procedure and to gain experience with the mechanically over - constraining fins that connect the cage to the inner top ring of the telescope .",
    "meanwhile the lenses were installed in their cells and carefully aligned using a rotary table at university college london .",
    "the lens plus cell assemblies were then inserted into their respective barrel sections , the cells having been previously aligned in the barrel sections using a coordinate measuring machine ( cmm ) at fermilab .",
    "these assemblies were also checked using the rotary table at ucl .",
    "they were pinned so that the positioning could be reproduced .",
    "the barrel sections were separated from each other and then sent to ctio .",
    "the rotary table was sent with them so that the optical alignments could be verified before the barrel sections were reassembled .",
    "assembly and testing continued at the telescope simulator .",
    "a full camera assembly was made , using an identical copy of the barrel with dummy weights in place of the optical elements .",
    "the hexapod was used to unite the ersatz barrel with the cage .",
    "the final imager dewar held engineering grade ccds in place of the final , science grade ccds . a flat - field generator and star pattern projector  @xcite were used as the light sources .",
    "the emphasis was on integration and tests of the readout electronics , the filter - changer ( without using the final filters , which were still being manufactured ) , shutter , hexapod , the ln2 cooling system controls , mechanical specifications such as the stiffness of the barrel and the flatness and alignment of the focal plane , and tests of the software control systems ( sispi ) .",
    "these tests were completed by may 2011 .",
    "after that all of the camera components were sent to chile apart from the imager dewar , which was retained at fermilab for testing while we loaded it with the science grade ccds .",
    "the imager dewar was the last major component to be shipped  @xcite , arriving in december 2011 .",
    "ctio led  @xcite the camera installation with intense and active participation by the decam design and construction team .",
    "sispi was installed on the new decam computers in april 2011 . from june to august 2011 the camera infrastructure was installed into the blanco dome , including the ln2 system that cools the ccds to operating temperature , and the chillers for the readout electronics .",
    "the camera components arrived in december and were staged for installation .",
    "the filter changer , shutter , and hexapod were individually retested using the sispi controls .    in january 2012 the optical corrector , which had arrived at ctio ,",
    "was assembled in the dust - free tent on the ground floor .",
    "the alignment of the components was tested using the rotary table .    in early march 2012",
    "the telescope was moved to zenith and locked into place .",
    "work platforms were installed in the upper part of the telescope that enabled access to the fin connections to the telescope rings . the primary mirror was removed and set aside , with protection , on the main floor of the dome .",
    "then the old prime focus cage was lowered to the floor and removed .",
    "the new prime focus cage was assembled using the copy of the barrel mentioned above and a dummy imager .",
    "that assembly was used to test the installation and fitting procedure and then removed .",
    "the cage attachment legs ( fins ) were reused from the original cage support . in may the decam cage , hexapod , and barrel ( including the optics ) , but using the dummy imager instead of the real thing ,",
    "were raised up the center of the telescope and attached .",
    "figure  [ fig : cageinsertion ] shows the new cage being inserted into the telescope upper structure . engineers and technicians from noao in tucson made up part of the team for the cage installation work .",
    "the primary mirror ( with its cell ) was returned and then the cage was optically centered from the cassegrain hole in the center of the primary . because decam is more than 2500 kgs heavier than the previous camera and cage assembly , and has an asymmetric moment arm due to the ln2 cable wraps on the sw side , maintaining telescope balance around the ra / dec axis required additional weight to be added to the cassegrain cage .",
    "a total counterweight of 5600 kg was needed , requiring a new cassegrain cage  @xcite with a reinforced design .",
    "lead ( pb ) and steel plates were used as the counterweight material .",
    "the new cassegrain cage was installed in june .",
    "the telescope remained pointing at zenith throughout this work .",
    "after the new cage was installed the telescope was moved to the northwest platform . over the next couple of months",
    "the telescope was dressed with the vacuum - jacketed liquid nitrogen lines , water - glycol , vacuum , compressed - air and other utilities .",
    "the imager and readout electronics , which had been under continuous test in the coud room , were attached to the barrel on august 30 , 2012 .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : mountcamera ] .",
    "next the electronic and electrical connections were installed on the back of the camera .  first flight \" of the camera , when the telescope was actively driven around in the dome in ra and dec , occurred within a few days .",
    "the led cones , photodiodes and fibre projector units of the calibration system ( decal - see section  [ s8:calibration ] ) were installed on the telescope top ring during early september 2012 .",
    "the filter changer and shutter were installed last .",
    "official  first light \" was on the night of september 12 ( ut ) , 2012 .",
    "we achieved 1.2  seeing across the focal plane within 45 minutes of the start of observations with the new camera . among the objects observed were the globular cluster 47 tucanae ( ngc 104 ) , the fornax galaxy cluster , and the small magellanic cloud .",
