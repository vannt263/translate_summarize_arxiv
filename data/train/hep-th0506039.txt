    "scalar fields propagating in extra dimensions have been widely investigated .",
    "a suitable combination of bulk and brane potentials can provide a nontrivial profile for a bulk field , which can serve many purposes .",
    "for instance , it can be employed for stabilizing the size of the extra space , as in the goldberger ",
    "wise  @xcite mechanism ; alternatively , it can be used to localize matter in a narrow region in the extra space , as originally done by rubakov and shaposhnikov  @xcite .",
    "although gauge fields are not localized in ref .",
    "@xcite , this mechanism can be considered as a field theory regularization of a delta  like lower dimensional object , as for instance a brane of string theory .",
    "the field theory description can have interesting phenomenological consequences : for instance , it allows to localize fields of different families at slightly different positions in the bulk , so to explain the fermion mass hierarchy of the standard model  @xcite ; if the scalar field can vary over cosmological times , it can allow for a greater baryon and cp violation at early times  @xcite , and overcome the obstacles for baryogenesis that characterize several models of extra dimensions  @xcite .    in these examples ,",
    "the bulk scalar has standard kinetic terms .",
    "a few works discuss the possibility of more general kinetic terms .",
    "there are at least two reasons to be interested in this possibility .",
    "one is related to the idea of self  tuning  @xcite . in extra dimensions ,",
    "a brane tension can give rise to a warping of the extra space , without inducing a @xmath0 expansion  @xcite .",
    "this typically requires a fine  tuning between the energies in the bulk and on the brane .",
    "however , one can hope that the fine  tuning can be avoided in some special cases .",
    "@xcite presents a general theorem against this possibility , which however relies on the presence of bulk fields with standard kinetic terms",
    ". mechanisms of self - tuning with fields with nonstandard kinetic terms were advanced for instance in refs .  @xcite . in particular , ref .",
    "@xcite makes use of a scalar field with a quartic derivative term .",
    "a second motivation is the attempt to resolve a negative tension brane in field theory .",
    "the kink solution of ref .",
    "@xcite has positive energy density , and thus it can be regarded as a resolved positive tension brane .",
    "@xcite makes use of a scalar field with the `` wrong '' sign for the kinetic term , and finds a kink profile with negative energy density .",
    "more in general , ref .",
    "@xcite shows that any attempt to resolve a negative tension brane through a bulk scalar necessary requires that this field is a ghost . in principle",
    ", one may hope that a ghost could also serve the purpose of self  tuning , since the negative kinetic term may absorb a brane tension to restore @xmath0 flatness .",
    "clearly , these proposals call for a discussion of their stability . for instance , the set - up of ref .",
    "@xcite is clearly unstable , due to the presence of the ghost field .",
    "however , the situation is more subtle for the main model discussed in ref .  @xcite . in this model , the kinetic term of the scalar field changes sign along the bulk .",
    "the profile of the field provides a resolution of both a positive and a negative brane , placed at two different locations in the bulk ( where the kinetic term has the `` correct '' and the `` wrong '' sign , respectively ) .",
    "it is not obvious _ a priori _ which of these two regions controls the stability of the background .",
    "a calculation @xcite , based on an effective @xmath0 potential , suggests that the model has no tachyons .",
    "however , as also acknowledged in ref .",
    "@xcite , the stability against ghosts requires a more accurate calculation which was beyond the aims of that work .",
    "more in general , we find very interesting to discuss the stability of models with a kinetic term which is not sign definite .",
    "this is the main purpose of the present investigation .",
    "the stability of a given background requires a careful general relativity treatment .",
    "the fluctuations of the scalar field source and mix with the ( scalar ) fluctuations of the geometry .",
    "such calculations are standard in @xmath0 cosmology , for what concerns the generation of inhomogeneities and growth of structures .",
    "this framework has been extended to extra dimensional models , both for discussing the stability , and the coupling of bulk fluctuations to brane fields ( with a focus on accelerator phenomenology ) .",
    "a general formalism can be found in ref .",
    "the application to radion phenomenology was first done in ref .",
    "@xcite , and then in several other works .",
    "however , the exact identification of the physical excitations , with the bulk scalar  geometry mixing fully taken into account was performed only recently @xcite .",
    "we generalize the computation of ref .",
    "@xcite , valid for a bulk field @xmath1 with standard kinetic terms , to the case of a kinetic term of the form @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is an arbitrary function of the bulk scalar .",
    "although we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for some of the details , we try to keep the present discussion self  contained .",
    "we identify the exact @xmath0 physical modes of the system .",
    "both the kinetic and mass term for the various modes are obtained by decomposing the original action and integrating along the compact coordinate .",
    "we explicitly show that the portion of the bulk integral where @xmath4 gives a positive contribution to the kinetic coefficient of each mode , while the bulk region with @xmath5 gives a negative contribution .",
    "whether a mode is or is not a ghost then depends on where it is mostly localized .",
    "the linearized computation becomes questionable around the points where @xmath3 vanishes .",
    "at the technical level , one can expect singular terms in the equations for the perturbations .",
    "this is not obvious _ a priori_. for instance ,",
    "@xcite discusses a somewhat similar problem in scalar field @xmath0 cosmology . in that case , the equation for the metric perturbation is singular when the kinetic term for the background inflaton vanishes , @xmath6 .",
    "however , the equation for the mukhanov ",
    "sasaki  @xcite variable , which properly identifies the physical mode of the system is regular .",
    "also in the present case , one may hope that , due to the mixing with gravity , the kinetic term for the proper physical excitations may be regular where @xmath7 .",
    "the computation shows that this is not the case .",
    "we find that the singularity is mild enough that one can find normalizable modes in both the regions @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "however , it is also strong enough that these regions are not in communication ; at the technical level , it is not possible to obtain junction conditions which relate the profile of a mode across the points where @xmath10 .",
    "we show this explicitly for the model of ref .",
    "@xcite ; however , we also show that this a very general conclusion , irrespectively of the form of @xmath3 .",
    "the safest interpretation is probably that the theory for the perturbations is ill defined due to the vanishing of the kinetic function , and that modifications ( for instance , the introduction of higher derivative terms ) are necessary to have a better defined quantum field theory . to confirm the separation of the two regions , we attempt to regularize the singularity through a cut  off , and to investigate the behavior of the solutions as the cut - off is removed . doing so , we find that the limiting solutions either vanish where @xmath3 is positive or where it is negative .",
    "this regularization explicitly shows that the eigenvalue problem which determines the bulk profile of the modes effectively splits into two eigenvalue problems , characterized by a different mass spectrum .",
    "hence , a physical mode can only live in one of the two regions ; the modes which have support where @xmath5 are ghosts , and preclude the stability of the background .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in section  [ one ]",
    "we present the general computation for the perturbations , for a generic kinetic function @xmath11 . in section  [ two ]",
    "we apply it to the main model of ref .",
    "@xcite . in section",
    "[ three ] we discuss how our findings generalize beyond this application .",
    "we start from the action for a scalar field @xmath1 plus gravity , @xmath12 \\,\\ , , \\label{az}\\ ] ] which is defined on a compact and periodic extra dimension @xmath13 . for the moment",
    ", we assume that there are no branes present , so that the calculation is simpler .",
    "we discuss below how the result changes when boundary branes are present .",
    "we note the presence of a nonstandard kinetic term , where we allow for an arbitrary function @xmath14 .",
    "the standard case corresponds to @xmath15 .",
    "more in general , @xmath1 is a ghost whenever @xmath5 .",
    "finally , we note that a possible bulk cosmological constant is implicitly included in  ( [ az ] ) , by simply shifting the zero point energy of @xmath16 .",
    "we are interested in background solutions which only depend on @xmath17 , and with the factorizable geometry @xmath18 \\,\\,.\\ ] ] ( notice @xmath13 is a conformal coordinate ; also , notice we have chosen the mostly positive signature for the minkowsky metric ) .",
    "it is straightforward to canonically normalize the scalar field , through the relation @xmath19 so that the background einstein equations are @xmath20 these two equations can be combined to give the equation of motion for @xmath1 , @xmath21 prime on @xmath1 or @xmath22 denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath17 , while @xmath23 , and analogously for @xmath24 . although  ( [ psi ] ) is formally defined only where @xmath3 is positive , it is immediate to verify that eqs .",
    "( [ einbkg])([eomphi ] ) hold in general .",
    "periodicity conditions supplement these equations , and allow to determine the background solution .",
    "as we mentioned , we are interested in the stability of the background against scalar perturbations .",
    "we introduce the perturbations of the bulk scalar , which we denote as @xmath25 .",
    "in addition , one can reduce the system of metric perturbations to a unique mode @xmath26 , which , in the @xmath27 longitudinal gauge , appears as @xmath28\\ ] ]    if @xmath3 is positive definite , one expects that also the calculation for the perturbations can be readily obtained from the standard one , upon the redefinition  ( [ psi ] ) .",
    "however , as we mentioned in the introduction , the situation is more delicate if @xmath3 can change sign . as in the standard case ,",
    "the two perturbations @xmath29 and @xmath30 are related by constraint einstein equations , and only one linear combination of them is dynamical . among different possible dynamical variables ,",
    "one is particularly convenient for the diagonalization of the action ; it is the @xmath27 generalization of the mukhanov ",
    "sasaki  @xcite variable @xmath31 , introduced for the study of scalar perturbations in @xmath0 cosmology . in the present case , combining the analysis of  @xcite with the redefinition  ( [ psi ] ) , we find @xmath32 where @xmath33    a lengthy but straightforward computation confirms that the action for the perturbations ( obtained by expanding at second order in the perturbations the starting action  ( [ az ] ) ) acquires a particularly simple form in terms of the mode @xmath34 , @xmath35 v \\,\\",
    ", , \\label{az2}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 denotes the sign of @xmath11 .",
    "it is worth noting that the use of the generalized mukhanov ",
    "sasaki variable automatically `` rescales away '' the function @xmath3 from the kinetic term , up to its sign . however , the potential problems with vanishing @xmath3 are `` encoded '' in the fact that @xmath37 vanishes for @xmath10 , so that , unless there are cancellations with @xmath38 , the effective potential for the perturbations is divergent .",
    "we already discussed this problem in the introduction ; in the next section we will discuss how this problem can be dealt with in a specific example . here , we simply proceed with the computation , by decomposing the @xmath27 variable @xmath31 into kk modes , @xmath39 the modes @xmath40 represent quantum fields in the @xmath0 description of the model , while @xmath41 are the corresponding wave functions in the bulk .",
    "they are determined by separating the equation of motion for @xmath31 which follows from  ( [ az2 ] ) , @xmath42 this eigenvalue equation , together with the periodicity condition along the extra dimension , determines the bulk profiles @xmath43 , as well as the spectrum of the theory , @xmath44 . the exact profile found here",
    "is then employed to compute whether a mode is a ghost or not , as we show now .    as remarked in the introduction , we are interested in the kinetic terms of the @xmath0 modes . due to the hermiticity of  ( [ az2 ] ) , different modes are orthogonal , and  ( [ az2 ] )",
    "separates into the sum of decoupled quadratic actions for each mode , @xmath45 q_n \\,\\,,\\ ] ] where ( comparing with  ( [ az2 ] ) ) it is immediate to see that the coefficients @xmath46 are given by @xmath47 a further rescaling @xmath48 renders the mode canonically normalized .",
    "however , the sign of @xmath46 is not rescaled away by this redefinition , and it thus controls whether the mode @xmath49 is a ghost or not .",
    "as we see , each coefficient @xmath46 gets positive contributions where @xmath4 , and negative contributions where @xmath50 .",
    "so , the nature of a mode is determined by whether its wave function is mostly localized where @xmath4 , or @xmath51 .    for completeness",
    ", we conclude this section by giving the result of the computation when also boundary terms are present .",
    "more specifically , the extra coordinate is assumed to lie on the compact interval @xmath52 , delimited by two orbifold ( @xmath53 symmetric ) boundary branes .",
    "we assume that the brane contains a @xmath54dependent potential term , @xmath55 + u \\left",

    "however , we will not consider them here .",
    "the branes enforce boundary conditions , which replace the periodicity conditions considered so far . for the background",
    ", we have @xmath58 where the upper / lower sign refer to the brane at @xmath59 , respectively . for the perturbations we get instead @xmath60 these new equations , together with the eigenvalue equation  ( [ eigenv ] ) , allow to determine the spectrum and the bulk profiles of the modes .",
    "a simple extension of the calculation of  @xcite shows that the coefficients @xmath46 acquires a boundary contribution @xmath61 where we have defined @xmath62 , in strict analogy to  ( [ deco ] ) .",
    "the boundary values of @xmath63 can be obtained from the ones of @xmath41 through the definition  ( [ vdef ] ) and the boundary conditions  ( [ jpert ] ) .",
    "let us discuss how the above formalism applies to the model of ref .",
    "the model is characterized by the bulk action  ( [ az ] ) , with @xmath64 extending on a periodic interval ( @xmath65 is the five dimensional planck mass while @xmath66 are some constants ) .",

    "the sourcing bulk scalar is also periodic in the bulk , and the scalar density @xmath70 is mostly localized at @xmath71 , where @xmath22 has its extrema .",
    "this model represents an attempt to regularize a brane / anti  brane system .",

    "the modes are regular at @xmath120 , so we have four nontrivial boundary conditions there .",
    "as can be expected , the problems arise for the matching at @xmath121 . at this point ,",
    "the mode  ( [ modes ] ) vanishes , while its derivative diverges , @xmath122 ( and analogously for @xmath85 approaching @xmath123 from the right ) .",
    "hence , the two boundary conditions at @xmath124 are absent , and a global solution can not be determined .",
    "this confirms the expectation that the linearized problem is ill posed , due to the vanishing of the kinetic function @xmath11 .",
    "one can expect that higher order terms can be relevant where @xmath3 vanishes , providing a cut  off where the effective potential is unbounded . in the following we regularize the potential by hand with a cut  off at @xmath125 ( which allows to solve the linearized problem ) .",
    "more precisely , we take the potential to be constant ( matching the value from  ( [ approx ] ) ) , in the interval @xmath126 ; we then study the behavior of the solution as @xmath127 .",

    "this limiting solution is the one which could have been easily guessed from elementary quantum mechanics .",

    "the more relevant case of @xmath135 can be studied analogously .",
    "the additional terms in the potential can be also approximated by simple polynomials , and analytic solutions can be obtained in terms of new special functions .",

    "the limit @xmath137 is not continuous .    for small @xmath138",
    "the eigenvalues occur in finely split pairs .",

    "this can be easily explained .",
    "as we have seen , for @xmath142 the two halves of the space are not in communication .",
    "hence , the eigenvalue problem  ( [ sch ] ) effectively decouples in two different problems . unless the potential is symmetric in the two halves , the two eigenvalue problems admit different eigenvalues .",

    "( [ norma ] ) , is positive , and hence they are well behaving @xmath0 scalars . on the contrary ,",
    "the modes which have support in the other half of the bulk , where @xmath3 is negative , are ghosts .",
    "although we have investigated only a limited set of values for @xmath138 , this second class of models has always been present for all the values we have considered ( in a comparable amounts to the modes in group i ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that the model  ( [ maxmodel ] ) is unstable already at the semiclassical level .",
    "our main motivation was to study explicitly how the vanishing of the kinetic function @xmath3 affects the system of perturbations .",
    "quite in general , one can expect singularities in correspondence to the zeros of @xmath11 .",

    "@xcite , the singularities are mild enough so that the regions where @xmath148 and @xmath8 admit normalizable modes for the perturbations ; however , we also saw that the singularity is strong enough so that these regions do not communicate , and the modes have support only in one of them .",
    "modes which have support where @xmath3 is negative are ghosts , and preclude the stability of the background .",
    "we now argue that this effect is quite general , irrespectively of the detailed form of @xmath11 . to see this ,",

    "as manifest in  ( [ general ] ) , a possible `` cure '' to the instability could be to arrange @xmath24 to vanish precisely where @xmath3 also does .",
    "this is a rather trivial solution , which however is likely to postpone the problem at orders higher than quadratic .",
