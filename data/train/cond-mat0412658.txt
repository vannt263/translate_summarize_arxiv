    "many natural and artificial systems have a network structure , where nodes represent typical system units and edges represent interactions between connected pairs of units .",
    "thus , complex networks are currently used to model several kinds of real - life systems ( social , biological , technological , economic ) , and to study different processes taking place on them @xcite . in recent years",
    ", new models of complex networks have been designed to explain empirical data in several fields .",
    "this is the case of the so - called small - world @xcite and scale - free networks @xcite , which incorporate various aspects of real systems .",
    "these complex networks provide us with the underlying topological structure to analyze processes such as spread of infections @xcite , signal propagation @xcite , and random spreading of information @xcite .",
    "they have been also employed to study statistical physical problems as percolation @xcite and cooperative phenomena @xcite .    in a",
    "scale - free ( sf ) network the degree distribution @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the number of links connected to a node , has a power - law decay @xmath0 .",
    "this kind of networks have been found in social systems @xcite , for protein interactions @xcite , in the internet @xcite , and in the world - wide web @xcite . in both natural and artificial networks ,",
    "the exponent @xmath9 controlling the degree distribution is usually in the range @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the origin of such power - law degree distributions was addressed by barabsi and albert @xcite , who argued that two ingredients are sufficient to explain the scale - free character of many real - life networks , namely : growth and preferential attachment .",
    "they found that the combination of both criteria yields non - equilibrium sf networks with an exponent @xmath13 .",
    "one can also study equilibrium sf networks , defined as statistical ensembles of random networks with a given degree distribution @xmath14@xcite , for which one can analyze several properties as a function of the exponent @xmath9 .",
    "sf networks display the so - called small - world effect , and they have been found to be ultrasmall , in the sense that the mean distance between sites increases with the network size @xmath5 slower than @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "social networks form the substrate where dynamical processes such as disease propagation and information spreading take place .",
    "these networks have the property of being searchable , i.e. people ( nodes in a network ) can direct messages through their network of acquaintances to reach a distant specific target in only a few steps @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the structure of such networks will play an important role in these dynamical processes , which are usually studied by means of stochastic dynamics and random walks .",
    "several characteristics of random walks on complex networks have been analyzed in connection with diffusion and exploration processes @xcite . in this context",
    ", it is known that some processes , such as navigation and exploratory behavior are neither purely random nor totally deterministic @xcite , and can be described by walks on graphs @xcite .",
    "self - avoiding walks ( saws ) can be more effective than unrestricted random walks in exploring a network , since they can not return to sites already visited .",
    "this property has been used by adamic _",
    "@xcite to define local search strategies in scale - free networks",
    ". however , the self - avoiding property causes attrition of the paths , in the sense that a large fraction of paths generated in a stochastic manner have to be abandoned because they are overlapping .",
    "this can be a serious limitation to explore networks with pure saws .",
    "saws have been traditionally used to model structural and dynamical properties of macromolecules @xcite .",
    "they are also useful to characterize complex crystal structures @xcite and to study critical phenomena in lattice models @xcite .",
    "universal constants for saws on regular lattices have been discussed by privman _",
    "_ @xcite . in our context of complex networks ,",
    "the asymptotic properties of saws have been studied recently in small - world networks @xcite .    here",
    "we study long - range properties of saws on equilibrium scale - free networks , and discuss the ` attrition problem ' .",
    "the number of surviving walks to a given length @xmath16 is obtained by an approximate analytical procedure , and the results are compared with those obtained from numerical simulations . in particular , we find that the number of surviving walks after @xmath16 steps scales as a power of the system size @xmath5 .",
    "we note that the term ` length ' is employed throughout this paper to indicate the ( dimensionless ) number of steps of a walk , as usually in the literature on networks @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we give some definitions and concepts related to saws , along with details on our computational method .",
    "in sec.iii we calculate the number and end - to - end separation of saws in ( uncorrelated ) scale - free networks . in sec.iv",
    "we analyze the length at which non - reversal random walks intersect themselves in these networks ( self - intersection length ) , and in sec.v we calculate the average attrition length of kinetic growth saws , at which they can not continue without violating the self - avoidance condition .",
    "the paper closes with some conclusions in sec.vi .",
    "a self - avoiding walk ( saw ) is defined as a walk along the bonds of a given network which can never intersect itself .",
    "the walk is restricted to moving to a nearest - neighbor site during each step , and the self - avoiding condition constrains the walk to occupy only sites which have not been previously visited in the same walk .",
    "the simplest procedure to obtain saws consists just in generating ordinary random walks and stop when they arrive at a node already visited .",
    "a problem with this sampling algorithm in regular lattices is the exponentially rapid attrition for long walks , since the probability of an @xmath16-step walk being self - avoiding behaves for large @xmath16 as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the so - called attrition constant @xcite . due to this limitation ,",
    "more sophisticated schemes based on monte carlo sampling , have been employed to generate saws with the correct weight , and to obtain ensemble averages of several quantities @xcite .",
    "this has allowed , for example , to model the equilibrium statistics of linear polymers in dilute solutions . in general , for networks including nodes with different degrees ( contrary to usual regular lattices ) , sampling by using simple random walks introduces a bias in the weight of different saws .",
    "one can also consider kinetically grown saws , which can be more adequate to analyze dynamic processes .",
    "such walks are well - suited to study , for example , search or navigation processes on networks , where they are assumed to grow step by step in a temporal sequence . in the following",
    "we will consider two kinds of growing walks .",
    "the first kind will be ` non - reversal ' self - avoiding walks @xcite . in these",
    "walks one randomly chooses the next step from among the neighboring nodes , excluding the previous one .",
    "if it happens that one chooses an already visited node , then the walk stops ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . these walks will allow us to study the ` self - intersection length ' ( see sec .",
    "the second kind of walks considered here are kinetic growth walks @xcite , in which one randomly chooses the next step among the neighboring unvisited sites and stops growing when none are available .",
    "these walks were studied to describe the irreversible growth of linear polymers @xcite , and will allow us to consider the ` attrition length ' for a walk on a given network ( see sec .",
    "v ) . note that kinetic growth walks are less sensitive to attrition than non - reversal saws , since in the former the walker always escapes whenever a way exists .",
    "we consider sf networks with degree distribution @xmath0 .",
    "they are characterized , apart from the exponent @xmath9 and the system size @xmath5 , by the minimum degree @xmath19 , which affects markedly some characteristics of saws in these networks ( see below ) .",
    "we assume that @xmath20 for @xmath21 .",
    "our networks are uncorrelated , in the sense that degrees of nearest neighbors are statistically independent .",
    "this means that the joint probability @xmath22 fulfills the relation @xcite @xmath23    for the numerical simulations we have generated networks with several values of @xmath9 , @xmath19 , and @xmath5 . to generate a network ,",
    "once defined the number of nodes @xmath24 with degree @xmath11 , we ascribe a degree to each node according to the set @xmath25 , and then connect at random ends of links ( giving a total of @xmath26 connections ) , with the conditions : ( i ) no two nodes can have more than one bond connecting them , and ( ii ) no node can be connected by a link to itself .",
    "we have checked that networks generated in this way are uncorrelated , i.e. they fulfill eq .",
    "( [ kk1 ] ) .",
    "all networks considered here contain a single component , i.e. any node in a network can be reached from any other node by traveling through a finite number of links . for each set of parameters ( @xmath9 , @xmath19 , @xmath5 )",
    ", we considered different network realizations , and for a given network we selected at random the starting nodes for the saws .",
    "for each considered parameter set , the total number of generated saws amounted to about @xmath27 .    for regular lattices",
    ", the number @xmath2 of different saws starting from a generic site has an asymptotic dependence for large @xmath16 @xcite : @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is a critical exponent which depends on the lattice dimension , and @xmath30 is the so - called ` connective constant ' or effective coordination number of the considered lattice @xcite . in general , for a lattice with connectivity @xmath19 , one has @xmath31 .",
    "this parameter @xmath30 can be obtained as the limit @xmath32 the connective constant depends upon the particular topology of each lattice , and has been determined very accurately for two- and three - dimensional lattices @xcite .    for poissonian and scale - free networks",
    "the number of saws of length @xmath16 depends on the considered starting node of the network . in the sequel we will call @xmath2 the average number of saws of length @xmath16 , i.e. the mean value obtained ( for each @xmath16 ) by averaging over the network sites and over different network realizations ( for given @xmath9 , @xmath19 , and @xmath5 ) . for erds - rnyi random networks with poissonian distribution of degrees , one has @xmath33 @xcite , and therefore the connective constant is @xmath34 . in connection with this",
    ", we note that for a bethe lattice ( or cayley tree ) with connectivity @xmath19 , the number of saws is given by @xmath35 , and one has @xmath36 .",
    "we calculate first the average number , @xmath37 , of different @xmath16-step unrestricted walks starting from a node chosen at random .",
    "one trivially has @xmath38 . to calculate @xmath37 for @xmath39",
    ", one needs the degree distribution for nodes at which one arrives following a random edge .",
    "thus , given a generic node and a link starting on it , we call @xmath40 the degree distribution for the other end of the link .",
    "the probability of reaching a node with connectivity @xmath11 is proportional to @xmath11 ; therefore @xmath41 where @xmath42 in the denominator is a normalization factor .",
    "then , the average number of two - step random walks is given by @xmath43 , where the subscript @xmath44 indicates that the average value is taken with the probability distribution @xmath40 .",
    "we find @xmath45 [ average values without subscripts are taken with the degree distribution @xmath10 ] .",
    "for @xmath47 we have @xmath48 , and then @xmath49 we have checked that this expression for @xmath37 and those given below for saws coincide with those derived by using a generating function for the degree distribution @xcite .",
    "we now calculate the average number , @xmath2 , of different self - avoiding walks of @xmath16 steps starting from a node taken at random , in uncorrelated networks .",
    "we will first consider the case @xmath50 ( thermodynamic limit ) .",
    "for @xmath51 , one has @xmath52 .",
    "for @xmath53 we take into account that each ( @xmath54)-step walk arriving at a node with degree @xmath11 , gives rise to @xmath55 @xmath16-step walks .",
    "thus , we have @xmath56 , which yields @xmath57 then , the connective constant @xmath58 for @xmath1 is given by @xmath59 this is consistent with the fact that uncorrelated networks are locally tree - like , and the ratio @xmath60 is the average degree of a randomly - chosen end node of a randomly chosen link @xcite . for sf networks with @xmath61",
    ", @xmath30 diverges as @xmath1 , as a consequence of the divergence of @xmath62 . for @xmath63 , we can approximate the average values in eq . ( [ mu ] ) by replacing sums by integrals , and",
    "find @xmath64    note that the ratio @xmath65 does not depend on @xmath16 for system size @xmath1 .",
    "this is equivalent to assume that nodes in different steps of a non - reversal random walk are different .",
    "this means , in other words , that the probability of finding loops with @xmath66 in a @xmath16-step walk is negligible . for finite networks ,",
    "however , there will appear loops of any size @xcite , introducing corrections to the number of saws , and @xmath2 will be lower than given by eq .",
    "these corrections will be of order @xmath67 for @xmath68 .",
    "the effects of this reduction in the number of random saws in scale - free networks will be considered in sections iv and v.    as indicated above , the number of saws on regular lattices scales for large @xmath16 as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is a critical exponent which depends on the lattice dimension @xmath69 , and one has @xmath70 for @xmath71 @xcite . for the sf networks studied here we find @xmath72 , indicating that @xmath70 , the same exponent as for regular lattices in many dimensions .      for walks on regular lattices ,",
    "one usually considers an end - to - end euclidean distance .",
    "our sf networks , however , lack a metric and a true distance is not defined .",
    "thus , we will consider the end - to - end separation for saws on sf networks as a function of the walk length @xmath16 , the separation between two nodes being the number of links along the shortest path connecting them . in fig .",
    "2 we present the average separation @xmath73 from the @xmath16th node in a saw to the starting one ( @xmath74 ) for sf networks with @xmath13 , @xmath75 , and several sizes @xmath5 .",
    "this average separation @xmath73 increases first linearly with @xmath16 and finally saturates to a finite value that depends on the system size .",
    "this is logical if one takes into account that these networks are locally tree - like , and for the first steps the minimum separation between nodes @xmath16 and 0 is @xmath76 . as @xmath16 increases , there appear shorter ways connecting nodes @xmath16 and 0 , and finally @xmath73 becomes independent of @xmath16 .",
    "this saturation for relatively small values of @xmath16 is consistent with the small average separation between pairs of nodes ( diameter ) in this kind of networks .",
    "in fact , it is known that the diameter increases slowly as @xmath77 for @xmath13 , and even more slowly as @xmath78 for @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "the limit of @xmath73 for large @xmath16 in our saws is lower than the diameter of the considered networks , because nodes with larger @xmath11 have a higher probability of being visited than those with smaller @xmath11 , as indicated above .",
    "since the average separation of a node to all other nodes in a network decreases for increasing degree of the selected node , the average separation @xmath73 for large @xmath16 in saws is lower than the diameter of the network .",
    "for example , for two of the system sizes represented in fig .",
    "2 ( @xmath80 and @xmath81 ) we have for large @xmath16 , @xmath73 = 4.60 and 5.88 vs diameters of 4.77 and 6.07 , respectively .    for regular lattices ,",
    "the mean squared end - to - end distance of saws scales for large @xmath16 as @xmath82 , @xmath83 being a dimension - dependent critical exponent .",
    "the upper critical dimension for these walks is @xmath84,@xcite which means that above this dimension one has @xmath85 , as for brownian motion ( markovian random walks ) . on the other side , for the sf networks studied here , the mean squared end - to - end separation scales as @xmath86 in the thermodynamic limit , i.e. , with an exponent @xmath87 .",
    "this exponent coincides with that corresponding to @xmath88 , reflecting the fact that loops become irrelevant in the considered networks as @xmath1 ( networks become tree - like ) .",
    "this behavior is , however , not captured by saws on finite sf networks , for which @xmath89 converges to a constant , and therefore gives a null exponent for sufficiently large @xmath16 .",
    "as indicated above , finite - size effects on saws on any ( finite ) network will be appreciable as soon as the walks are long enough , as a consequence of the presence of loops in the network .",
    "thus , saws are a suitable tool to probe the large - scale topological structure of complex networks . in particular , the probability of a walk intersecting itself will depend on the system size , as well as on the topology of the network under consideration . to study this probability ,",
    "we consider here non - reversal self - avoiding walks @xcite , that stop when they try to visit a node already visited in the same walk .",
    "the number of steps of a given walk before intersecting itself will be called ` self - intersection length ' of the walk , and will be denoted @xmath90 .    to obtain the mean self - intersection length @xmath91 of these walks , we will calculate the probability that a walk stops at step @xmath16 ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "let us consider for the moment nodes with a given degree @xmath11 .",
    "the average number of nodes with degree @xmath11 visited after @xmath16 steps is @xmath93 and the average number of those yet unvisited is @xmath94 then , the probability of reaching in step @xmath16 an unvisited node is @xmath95 , and that of finding one already visited is @xmath96 .",
    "this is due to the fact that a visited node has @xmath97 possible links to reach it , as two of its connections are not available because they were employed earlier : one for an incoming step and one for an outgoing step .",
    "therefore , the probability @xmath98 of finding in step @xmath16 a visited node with any degree is @xmath99    inserting into eq .",
    "( [ pn1 ] ) expressions ( [ vk ] ) and ( [ uk ] ) for @xmath100 and @xmath101 , and keeping terms linear in @xmath67 one has @xmath102 and finally @xmath103 where @xmath104 note that for the networks considered here @xmath105 . in fact , @xmath106 is the condition to have a giant component in a network @xcite .    to calculate the probability distribution for the self - intersection length @xmath90 , we consider @xmath107 random walks starting from nodes taken at random .",
    "we call @xmath108 the number of non - reversal saws that remain after @xmath16 steps ( i.e. , those which did not find any node visited earlier ) .",
    "thus , @xmath109 , and considering @xmath16 as a continuous variable @xmath110 , we have a differential equation for @xmath111 : @xmath112 which yields for integer @xmath16 : @xmath113    in fig .",

    "( [ rl ] ) one finds a mean - square deviation for the self - intersection length of the walks : @xmath124 , with a constant @xmath125 .",

    "we note that the probability distribution @xmath127 ( and therefore the average value @xmath91 ) is independent of the minimum degree @xmath19 .",
    "it depends , apart from the system size , on the exponent @xmath9 of the degree distribution through the mean values @xmath42 and @xmath62 . in fig .",
    "5 we present the mean self - intersection length for sf networks with @xmath128 and several values of @xmath19 , as derived from numerical simulations .",
    "different @xmath19 values give a unique @xmath5-dependence of @xmath91 .",
    "thus , the dependence of @xmath91 on @xmath19 , which should appear in eq .",
    "( [ avl ] ) through the dependence of @xmath129 on @xmath19 , is negligible for our purposes .",
    "however , the minimum degree @xmath19 affects strongly other properties of saws , such as the attrition length studied in the following section .",
    "in this section we consider random saws , that travel on the network until they arrive at a node ( called hereafter ` blocking node ' ) , where they can not continue because all adjacent nodes have been already visited and are not available for the walk .",
    "these are kinetic growth walks , as defined by majid _",
    "the number of steps of a given walk until being blocked will be called attrition length of the walk , and will be denoted @xmath130 .",
    "we now calculate the average attrition length of kinetic growth walks , and obtain its asymptotic dependence for large system size @xmath5 . to find this average length",
    "we will derive a probability distribution for @xmath130 , in a way similar to that employed above for the self - intersection length . with this purpose",
    "we note that a blocking node for a kinetic growth walk is characterized by the fact that all its links except one ( employed for an incoming step ) connect it with nodes previously visited .",
    "then , for step @xmath16 of a walk and for a given degree @xmath11 , the average number @xmath131 of blocking nodes present in the network is given by the binomial formula : @xmath132 where @xmath98 ( @xmath133 for @xmath134 ) is the average fraction of links joining a generic node with nodes visited earlier , as given in eq .",
    "( [ pn4 ] ) .",

    "the probability of finding a blocking node in step @xmath16 is given by the ratio @xmath139 , where @xmath140 is the total number of ends of links in the network .",

    "high - degree nodes are visited more probably than low - degree ones , and once visited the former are more effective to block a saw in later steps ( they have more connections ) , thus reducing the mean self - intersection and attrition lengths .",
    "self - avoiding walks provide us with an adequate tool to study the long - range characteristics of sf networks .",
    "in particular , they allow us to study the quality of a network to be explored without returning to sites already visited .",
    "for large networks , the number of saws increases as @xmath167 , provided that @xmath134 . for a given @xmath16",
    ", @xmath2 decreases with decreasing system size , as a consequence of the presence of loops in the networks .",
    "these finite - size effects affect strongly the maximum length of kinetic growth walks on scale - free networks .",
    "we have calculated self - intersection and attrition lengths by using an approximate probabilistic method , which yields results in good agreement with those derived from numerical simulations . both , the average self - intersection length and attrition length scale as a power of the system size @xmath5 . for the mean self - intersection length of non - reversal saws we have @xmath122 , with @xmath123 depending on the exponent @xmath9 of the degree distribution",
    "in particular , for @xmath63 one has @xmath168 , and decreases as @xmath9 is lowered .",
    "the length of kinetic growth walks in scale - free networks is limited by attrition of the paths , and the mean attrition length follows a dependence @xmath7 , with @xmath8 depending on @xmath9 and the minimum degree @xmath19 . for @xmath63 ,",
    "one has @xmath169 .",
    "this dependence of the exponent @xmath8 on @xmath19 is remarkable , reflecting the fact that the length of saws is limited by attrition at sites with the minimum degree @xmath19 . +",
