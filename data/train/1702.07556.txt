    "hedging problem for contingent claims in incomplete markets is a centerpiece of mathematical finance . actually , many hedging methods for incomplete markets have been suggested . above all",
    ", we focus on mean - variance hedging ( mvh ) , which has been studied very well for about three decades .",
    "our aim of this paper is twofold : the first is to derive an explicit closed - form representation of mvh strategies for exponential additive models using malliavin calculus for levy processes .",
    "the second is to develop a simple numerical method for exponential lvy models , and to illustrate numerical results .",
    "we consider throughout an incomplete financial market in which only one risky asset and one riskless asset are tradable .",
    "let @xmath0 be the maturity of our market , and suppose that the interest rate of the riskless asset is @xmath1 for sake of simplicity .",
    "the risky asset price process , denoted by @xmath2 , is given as a solution to the following stochastic differential equation : @xmath3,\\hspace{3mm}s_0>0,\\ ] ] where @xmath4 , @xmath5 is a one - dimensional standard brownian motion , and @xmath6 is the compensated version of a homogeneous poisson random measure @xmath7 . here , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are deterministic measurable functions on @xmath10 $ ] , and @xmath11 is also deterministic and jointly measurable on @xmath10\\times\\bbr_0 $ ] .",
    "we assume @xmath12 , which ensures the positivity of @xmath2 .",
    "then , @xmath2 is given as an exponential of an additive process , that is , @xmath13 is continuous in probability and has independent increments .",
    "in addition , when @xmath8 and @xmath9 are given by a real number and a non - negative real number , respectively , and @xmath14 , we call @xmath2 an exponential lvy process",
    ". let @xmath15 be a square integrable random variable .",
    "we consider its value as the payoff of a contingent claim at the maturity @xmath16 . in principle , since our market is incomplete , we can not find a replicating strategy for @xmath15 , that is , there is no pair @xmath17 satisfying @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a set of predictable processes , which is considered as the set of all admissible strategies in some sense , and @xmath20 denotes the gain process induced by @xmath21 , that is , @xmath22 . note that each pair @xmath17 represents a self - financing strategy . instead of finding the replicating strategy",
    ", we consider the following minimization problem : @xmath23,\\ ] ] and call its solution @xmath24 the mvh strategy for claim @xmath15 if it exists . in other words ,",
    "the mvh strategy defined as the self - financing one minimizing the corresponding @xmath25-hedging error over @xmath26 .",
    "remark that @xmath27 gives the initial cost which is regarded as the corresponding price of @xmath15 , and @xmath28 represents the number of shares of the risky asset in the strategy at time @xmath29 .",
    "in addition to mvh strategy , locally risk - minimizing ( lrm ) strategy has been studied well as alternative hedging method in quadratic way .",
    "being different from the mvh approach , an lrm strategy is given as a replicating strategy which is not necessarily self - financing .",
    "thus , we need to take an additional cost process into account . roughly speaking ,",
    "an lrm strategy is defined as the one minimizing in the @xmath25-sense the risk caused by such an additional cost process among all replicating strategies which are not necessarily self - financing . for more details , see schweizer @xcite and @xcite . as for expressions of lrm strategies ,",
    "arai and suzuki @xcite obtained an explicit form for lvy markets using malliavin calculus for lvy processes . here , lvy market is a similar model framework to ours , but the coefficient functions @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath11 may have randomness .",
    "in other words , our model is a lvy market with deterministic coefficients .",
    "there is much literature on mvh strategies for jump type models . among others , arai @xcite , ern and kallsen @xcite , and jeanblanc et al .",
    "@xcite provided feedback - form representations of mvh strategies for general model frameworks using semimartingale approaches , duality approaches or backward stochastic differential equations , but their representations are not given concretely for concrete models . here , a representation of the mvh strategy @xmath28 is said to be feedback - form if it includes @xmath30 . moreover , lim @xcite considered a lvy market and gave a closed - form expression of @xmath31 , that is , an expression without using the values of @xmath31 up to time @xmath29 .",
    "however , he restricted @xmath15 to be bounded , and his expression is not an explicit form , since it includes solutions to backward stochastic differential equations . on the other hand , as researches on explicit representations for concrete models , hubalek et al .",
    "@xcite obtained a representation in feedback - form for exponential lvy models , and also their results have been extended to the additive process case and affine stochastic volatility models by goutte et al .",
    "@xcite , and kallsen and vierthauer @xcite , respectively .",
    "the discussion in @xcite is based on bilateral laplace transforms and the fllmer - schweizer ( fs ) decomposition , which is an expression of @xmath15 by the sum of a stochastic integral with respect to @xmath2 and a residual martingale .",
    "in addition , combining their theorems 3.1 and 3.3 , they also gave an explicit closed - form representation .",
    "as mentioned before theorem 3.3 in @xcite , an explicit closed - form representation might be preferred to one in feedback - form from a numeric analytical point of view , since @xmath30 is approximated with an involved recursive calculation , which is very time - consuming and entails a drop of the accuracy . for more details on this matter , see remark [ rem - rec ] .",
    "in addition , the closed - form representation obtained in @xcite is given as a direct extension of the feedback - form one using a general stochastic exponential , namely , it is also not appropriate for the development of numerical schemes . besides , their closed - form representation includes a stochastic integral with respect to the quadratic variation of @xmath2 which is not observable .",
    "therefore , we shall derive a different explicit closed - form representation for exponential additive models in order to develop a simple numerical method for which we need discrete observational data of @xmath2 alone .",
    "this is the first main purpose of this paper . in particular , we make use of results of @xcite , and represent @xmath31 in terms of malliavin calculus for lvy processes .",
    "furthermore , we rely on the argument of @xcite , which is based on a different decomposition of @xmath15 from the fs decomposition . as one more advantage of our representation ,",
    "path - dependent options are covered as seen in examples [ ex1 ] and [ ex3 ] , while @xcite excluded them .    as the second goal of this paper",
    ", we shall develop a numerical method to compute @xmath28 for non - zero given @xmath32 $ ] for exponential lvy models using the closed - form representation of @xmath31 obtained in this paper and the fast fourier transforms ( fft ) .",
    "there is some literature on numerical analysis of mvh strategies , say de franco et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite and so on , all of which computed the initial hedge @xmath33 or the hedging error induced by mvh strategies or both alone , but no one has developed any numerical scheme of @xmath28 for non - zero given @xmath32 $ ] so far as we know .",
    "the most difficulty on the development of numerical methods for mvh strategies lies in the fact that @xmath28 for given @xmath32 $ ] is depending on the whole trajectory of @xmath2 up to time @xmath29 . from a practical point of view , we can not observe the trajectory of @xmath2 continuously , however .",
    "thus , we compute @xmath31 approximately using discrete observational data of @xmath2 in this paper . the numerical method developed in this paper",
    "has the following two features .",
    "first , our method is based on the explicit closed - form representation obtained in this paper . as a result",
    ", we can avoid to use any involved recursive calculation , although a simple recursive calculation is needed in order to compute a discretization of a stochastic exponential .",
    "in addition , we use observational data of @xmath2 alone , in other words , our method do not need any unobservable data .",
    "second , we make use of results of arai et al .",
    "@xcite , which developed an fft - based numerical scheme of lrm strategies for exponential lvy models using results of @xcite . in principle , computing an mvh strategy is time - consuming since its expression includes stochastic integrals .",
    "nevertheless , an fft - based approach enables us to achieve high speed computation .",
    "moreover , results of @xcite is also used to compute the lrm strategy , which is included in our representation of @xmath31 .",
    "an outline of this paper is as follows : model description and mathematical preliminaries are given in section 2 . in particular , we introduce the variance - optimal martingale measure and malliavin calculus for lvy processes .",
    "the main result and its proof are addressed in section 3 .",
    "subsection 3.2 introduces some examples .",
    "section 4 is devoted to develop numerical scheme and to introduce numerical results .",
    "we consider throughout a financial market being composed of one risky asset and one riskless asset with finite time horizon @xmath0 . for simplicity , we assume that the interest rate of the market is given by @xmath1 , that is , the price of the riskless asset is @xmath34 at all times .",
