    "we use the same method to obtain the critical line for @xmath71 and @xmath72 both for random and non - random exchange interactions . in fig .",
    "[ dfsmalln ] we show the phase diagram for @xmath73 . in general , it is hard to determine @xmath65 for @xmath74 where @xmath64 varies less than 0.1% and @xmath65 is masked by the noise .",
    "for @xmath55 the critical values @xmath75 are well fitted by a linear function that for @xmath76 approaches the analytical result @xmath77  @xcite .",
    "the localization transition moves to lower values of @xmath65 when @xmath3 increases .",
    "in addition , for finite @xmath3 , the disordered chain has a lower @xmath78 for a given @xmath65 .",
    "however , this difference tends to reduce when @xmath79 .    in the thermodynamic limit",
    "the finite size scaling analysis must be done using the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath48 and , naively , one is forced to assume a scaling relation between them .",
    "the binder cumulant is an adimentional quantity that on the phase transition must scale as @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the spatial correlation length , @xmath82 is a scaling function and @xmath83 is a ratio between the imaginary - time size @xmath48 and some adequate function of the spatial size @xmath3 .",
    "for instance , one has @xmath84",
    "a simple argument shows that for fixed @xmath3 and generic values of the other parameters the binder cumulant attains a maximum as a function of @xmath48  @xcite .",
    "this argument still holds when long - range interaction are introduced by the bath .",
    "indeed , when @xmath48 is very small with respect to @xmath3 , one effectively has a very long one - dimensional stripe ( along the spatial dimension ) and the long - range interactions induced by the bath on the imaginary - time direction are irrelevant .",
    "moreover , for the values of the parameters that are close to the phase transition of the infinite @xmath47 system , one is well above the transition of the one dimensional system and @xmath85 . in the opposite limit of @xmath86 one is back in the kind of finite cluster problem discussed in the previous paragraphs .",
    "now , for the parameters chosen , the new one - dimensional model should have a finite correlation length away from its critical line and @xmath85 as well . for @xmath3 and all other parameters fixed @xmath64",

    "in fig  [ thermolimit ] we see that the infinite chain has a phase transition even at @xmath89 , in contrast to the small @xmath3 case .",
    "we find that the phase transition curve may be accurately described by a power law , and the size of the ordered phase increases with increasing coupling to the environment . for comparison",
    "we also show the transition line for a non - random ising chain with ohmic dissipation  @xcite as determined by using the same procedure and similar sizes as the ones we use in the disordered problem .",
    "the critical values for @xmath78 with @xmath90 , which corresponds to switching off the bath , agree with well established analytical results for both the random and non - random cases  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the critical values of the random and non - random models in terms of our variables are @xmath91 and @xmath92 respectively , which agree with our numerical calculations  @xcite .      in a usual paramagnetic to ferromagnetic phase transition one can expect to identify the critical line by looking for the location of the divergence of the global linear susceptibility defined as @xmath93 = \\frac1{n_\\tau } \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left [ \\langle m_i^2 \\rangle - \\langle m_i \\rangle^2\\right ] \\ ; , \\label{eq : global - chi}\\ ] ] and @xmath94    with the aim of later studying the effect of dissipation on the distribution of local susceptibility of the random chain , we attempted to analyze the divergence of the global susceptibility in finite clusters  @xcite . indeed , when @xmath62 we expect to find a divergence of @xmath95 only on the phase transition , and not within the paramagnetic phase as found for the isolated random infinite chain  @xcite .",
    "for finite values of the number of imaginary - time slices @xmath48 we found that the global linear susceptibility at @xmath38 fixed has a peak at value of @xmath96 that is quite higher than the one obtained from the analysis of the binder parameter in the limit @xmath46 .",
    "as expected the height of the peak increases while its position moves towards lower values of @xmath96 when @xmath48 increases .",
    "for @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 we find a deviation of the order of @xmath100 .",
    "this indicates that the finite size effects in @xmath48 are still very important .",
    "note that this holds for the ordered and disordered system as well .",
    "these observations are illustrated in figs .",

    "[ suc_comparada ] we attempted to compare the form of the peak for similar ordered and disordered systems , _",
    "i.e. _ with the same size and under the effect of the same external bath .",
    "we note that the peak is more pronounced in the ordered case and the deviation between its location at finite @xmath48 and the asymptotic @xmath46 one is less pronounced .",
    "more precisely , we found @xmath101    in conclusion , we found that the extrapolation of the finite @xmath48 susceptibility data to the thermodynamic limit is indeed very hard  @xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis of the scaling behavior needs to be perform but it currently goes beyond out computational power .",
    "this failure has to be kept in mind when trying to analyze the dynamic properties of the dissipative disordered ising chain in the paramagnetic phase , see sect .  [",
    "sect : critical ] .",
    "one of peculiarities of the critical behavior of the isolated quantum ising chain with random interactions is that the critical scaling is activated instead of of conventional power law type .",
    "we wish to investigate whether a similar behavior persists when ohmic dissipation is included .",
    "the binder ratio not only gives a criterion to find the phase transition curve but also helps to derive scaling laws .",
    "the study of the scaling laws for the function @xmath64 can in principle provide an answer to the question of whether the critical behavior is of conventional or activated type .",
    "finite size scaling implies that dimensionless quantities should scale as functions of @xmath102 , and as either @xmath103 in the case of conventional scaling or @xmath104 in the case of activated scaling . at the critical point , the correlation length in the spatial direction , @xmath81 , diverges .",
    "this suggests that the scaling variable should be @xmath105 or @xmath106 in each case respectively , where @xmath107 is the value of @xmath48 that maximizes @xmath64  @xcite .",
    "this way of analyzing the data has the advantage of not needing to determine the critical exponents @xmath35 or @xmath108 .",
    "however the interpretation of the numeric results is delicate .",
    "even for @xmath89 , where it is possible to show analytically the activated scaling  @xcite , it has been hard to distinguish between both types of scaling by means of monte carlo simulations  @xcite . in particular , in @xmath109 the numerical data confirmed the analytic prediction only when a mapping to fermions was used  @xcite .    in fig  [ gcomun0.4 ]",
    "we show the scaling of the binder parameter , @xmath110 , with @xmath111 ( conventional ) and in fig  [ gactivado0.4 ] with @xmath112 ( activated ) .",
    "both scalings give almost the same critical values @xmath113 in agreement with our previous simpler analysis using the independence of the height of the maximum on @xmath3 at criticality .",
    "unfortunately , the two scaling plots are of quite similar quality and with the system sizes considered here we can not distinguish between the two critical scalings .",
    "an alternative analysis of the critical scaling in the disordered models is based on the study of the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of local linear and non - linear susceptibilities and how they behave when approaching the critical line .    in the isolated random chain the pdf of local linear and non - linear susceptibilities decay , for large values of the arguments , with a power law that decreases when approaching the quantum critical point .",
    "the inverse of this power is linked to the dynamic critical exponent and its divergence on the transition implies activated scaling . at a finite distance from the critical point the decay becomes sufficiently slow so as to lead to a divergent global susceptibility .",
    "one may wonder whether this phenomenon also occurs in the presence of dissipation .    to try to give an answer to this question we started by studying the pdf of local linear susceptibilities of finite clusters ( @xmath62 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : problin ] we show @xmath114 for @xmath97 and four values of the number of imaginary - time slices , @xmath115 , at @xmath99 and @xmath116 .",
    "a finite value of @xmath48 gives a finite bound to the maximum possible @xmath117 .",
    "this figure can be compared to the left - most curve in fig .",
    "20 in the first reference in @xcite that has been obtained for @xmath97 and effectively with @xmath46 .",
    "this figure shows that the coupling to the external bath has not modified the form of the pdf in an important way .",
    "finally , we analyzed the decay of the probability density of the local linear susceptibilities when approaching the critical line .",
    "each panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : cuadrito ] displays these pdfs for four values of @xmath96 and @xmath38 fixed .",

    "the values of @xmath3 are given in the captions .",
    "the straight lines are guides to the eye to indicate a possible power - law decay and the values of this power are given in the caption .    even if it is clear from the figures that there is a trend to a decreasing power law decay as the transition is approached , a functional relation between this power and the distance to the critical line is hard to establish beyond doubt from the pure numerical data .",
    "analytic guidance , as was necessary to interpret correctly the numerical data for the isolated case , seems to be necessary here too .",
    "with a careful analysis of the monte carlo data we succeeded in determining the phase boundary between the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases in finite and infinite rings of interacting quantum ising spins in a transverse field and coupled to an external environment . while for finite number of spins there is no phase transition in the limit @xmath118 , in the thermodynamic limit one recovers the critical points of mccoy and wu in the disordered case , and onsager in the ordered problem .",
    "the method that we used allowed us to determine the caldeira - leggett critical value @xmath77 for @xmath55 with relatively little numerical effort .",
    "we used a similar analysis to find the phase transition of interacting finite clusters under the effect of an ohmic bath .",
    "a similar analysis could be used to study the influence of other types of baths ( sub - ohmic , super - ohmic ) for which less analytical results are available .",
    "the coupling to the bath enhances the extent of the ordered phase , as found in mean - field spin - glasses  @xcite and in the ordered ferromagnetic ising chain  @xcite .",
    "the griffiths phase still exists as characterised by large distributions of the local linear and non - linear susceptibilities ( the latter are not shown in the text ) . we expect to find similar results in higher finite dimensions and when frustration is included ( _ i.e. _ when negative exchanges also exist )",
    ".    our results for the type of scaling characterizing the phase transition for the disordered and dissipative infinite chain are not conclusive .",
    "even if we have no evidence for the failure of the activated scaling of the isolated case when dissipation is included , we can not exclude this possibility from our numerical data .",
    "it is important to notice that the activated scaling in the dissipation - less problem was found analytically and it was very hard to confirm numerically .",
    "it would be extremely interesting to extend fisher s renormalization group approach to the case of the random chain coupled to an environment to give a definitive answer to this question .",
    "the systems we studied admit applications in a variety of fields .",
    "quantum ( spin ) glass phases have been observed experimentally in several compunds  @xcite ; the role played by the coupling to the environment in their low - temperature anomalous properties has not been fully elucidated yet .",
    "interacting spin systems are now becoming popular as possible toy models for quantum computers , with the ising spins representing the qubits .",
    "it is obviously very important in this context to establish the effect of the coupling to the bath .",
    "another motivation for our study comes from the proposal in @xcite to describe non - fermi liquid behavior in certain @xmath119-electron systems with a similar model ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "finally , while classical phase transitions are well understood by now , the same does not apply to quantum phase transitions at zero temperature  @xcite .",

    "<S> we study the zero temperature static properties of dissipative ensembles of quantum ising spins arranged on periodic one dimensional finite clusters and on an infinite chain . </S>",
    "<S> the spins interact ferro - magnetically with nearest - neighbour pure and random couplings . </S>",
    "<S> they are subject to a transverse field and coupled to an ohmic bath of quantum harmonic oscillators . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the coupled system using monte carlo simulations of the classical two - dimensional counterpart model . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling to the bath enhances the extent of the ordered phase , as found in mean - field spin - glasses . in the case of finite clusters </S>",
    "<S> we show that a generalization of the caldeira - leggett localization transition exists . in the case of the infinite random chain we study the effect of dissipation on the transition and the griffiths phase .    </S>",
