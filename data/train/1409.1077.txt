    "recent technological advances in the field of quantum optics , such as integrated optics schemes , allow unprecedented control of various degrees of freedom of optical quantum systems .",
    "nevertheless , generation of quantum states of light beyond the set of squeezed vacuum states ( deterministic ) and , to some approximation , pairs of entangled photons ( probabilistic and in a postselective way ) , still remains challenging .",
    "most of the protocols implementing quantum technologies require however the use of more complex states .",
    "they often belong to the class of non - gaussian quantum states ( states with non - gaussian quasi - probability distribution  @xcite ) .",
    "their generation seems possible exploiting the efficient source of quantum light based on parametric down conversion ( pdc ) and quantum engineering .",
    "quantum engineering implements general quantum operations , often described by the positive operator - valued measures ( povms ) . since gaussian quantum superpositions of light are produced directly by the pdc source  @xcite , it is interesting to implement non - gaussian operations .",
    "they will turn the gaussian states into the non - gaussian multiphoton quantum superpositions of certain properties , required for realization of concrete quantum tasks .",
    "such states are necessary , for example , for obtaining a quantum speed - up in computation with quantum algorithms  @xcite and quantum super - resolution in quantum phase estimation using the n00n and nmmn states  @xcite .",
    "they may find also application in bell inequality tests performed with homodyne detection , the most easy accessible , fast and efficient photodetector at present .",
    "these tests can be used to certify quantum devices  @xcite .",
    "up to date , the most often experimentally realized non - gaussian operations comprise probabilistic single photon addition  @xcite or subtraction  @xcite .",
    "they closely approximate action of the creation and annihilation operator , respectively .",
    "an alternative method of implementing the creation operator , based on repeated spontaneous parametric down - conversion , was theoretically investigated in  @xcite .",
    "these operations can alternate , add or cancel certain components of the initial engineered superposition .",
    "since the probability of the success is very small , they can not be applied iteratively .",
    "quantum engineering in the form of a quantum filter can only cancel certain components of the initial superposition .",
    "quantum filtering was demonstrated for one- and two - photon fock states  @xcite .",
    "the filters were based on the hong - ou - mandel interference  @xcite and were capable of blocking single photons over photon pairs .",
    "a quantum device capable of filtering out two - mode states of light with mode populations differing by more than a certain threshold , was proposed in  @xcite .",
    "it is called the modulus of intensity difference filter ( mdf ) and is based on the multiphoton hong - ou - mandel interference performed in a feed - forward loop .",
    "it allows engineering of the multiphoton quantum superpositions in a way which is preserving specific superpositions .",
    "this may turn them useful for bell test and quantum metrology  @xcite .",
    "some of the features of this filter has already been experimentally demonstrated in  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we examine the experimental scheme from  @xcite and show that in fact it implements a whole family of quantum non - gaussian filters ( the mdf is just one of the possibilities ) .",
    "the filters can be applied to an arbitrary input state .",
    "we assume realistic photodetection in the filtering process .",
    "this is an important step in the analysis of quantum filtering , since lossy detection is detrimental for the possibility of observation of quantum effects .",
    "we model the inefficient detection in two different ways : with a beam splitter of a small reflectivity located in front of a perfect detector ( the usual way ) and a weierstrass transform , which implements a gaussian blur on the unaffected measurement outcome distribution .",
    "we show how the filter acts on an input quantum superposition by computing the photon number distributions and purity of the filtered states .",
    "we also construct the kraus operator for the filters which reveals their _ coherent _ action on an arbitrary input .",
    "the filtered states may find applications in quantum metrology , quantum communication and other quantum tasks .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",

    "[ ssec : mhom ] we recall the hong - ou - mandel interference and generalize it to the multiphoton case . in subsection [ ssec : filter ] we show state evolution within the feed forward loop . in subsection [ ssec : examples ] we analyze the family of the output states which can result from the filter and we construct its kraus operator describing the action on an arbitrary two - mode input state . in section [ photodetection ]",
    "we discuss two models of realistic photodetection .",
    "we also give the kraus operator describing the filters in presence of inefficient detection . in section [ sec : results ] we present numerical computations demonstrating the action of the filter with realistic photodetection for two important examples of initial quantum superpositions .",
    "the results are given for two population regimes : the few photon and the mesoscopic population of photons in the initial superpositions .",
    "the paper is summarized in conclusions .",
    "in this section we introduce an experimental setup ( fig .",

    "preserve the symmetry present in photon number distribution of an input two - mode quantum state .",
    "they implement a non - gaussian operation and prepare the input beam for further quantum tasks .",
    "the principle of work of the filters is based on the multiphoton hong - ou - mandel ( hom ) interference ( fig .",
    "[ filter]a ) observed in a feed forward loop .",
    "the same setup was used before to implement the modulus of intensity filter discussed in  @xcite .",
    "let us recall the two - photon hong - ou - mandel interference .",
    "we analyze the experimental setup shown in fig .",

    "they are registered by the photon counting detectors .",
    "the only possible measurement outcomes are either @xmath2 and @xmath3 or @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "thus , the probability distribution of the output population difference between the output ports of the beam splitter denoted by @xmath6 is @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in this case",
    "the events of `` large '' ( equal to the total photon number ) output difference are more likely than the events of `` small '' ( zero ) output difference .",
    "if the two photons enter the beam splitter through the same input port ( e.g. @xmath0 ) and the other port ( @xmath1 ) is empty , the most likely is that the photons exit separately , i.e. @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "we denote the initial total photon number by @xmath11 and the initial population difference by @xmath12 .",
    "the probability distributions of the output population difference @xmath13 are displayed in fig .",

    "[ 2phhom ] takes place if higher photon number ( fock ) states interfere at the 50:50 beam splitter .",

    "next , the output state ( [ ubs ] ) is measured by the perfect photon counting detectors located behind the beam splitter .",
    "this corresponds to a projection of the state ( [ ubs ] ) on some fock states @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "the total photon number is conserved by the beam splitter and equals @xmath34 .",

    "[ fig : single_mzi_s200 ] shows the probability distribution of the output population difference ( [ distribution ] ) computed for @xmath40 and two extreme cases of @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "these figures reveal the essence of the multiphoton hom interference : for two equal fock states interfering on a 50:50 beam splitter the most likely event is that all photons will exit together ( the probability distribution @xmath43 is double - peaked ) ; for a nonzero fock state interfering with the vacuum the most likely event is that the photons will split equally between the output ports ( the probability @xmath44 is given by the single - peaked binomial distribution ) .",
    "please note , that for any @xmath45 the distribution @xmath46 is symmetric : @xmath47 .",
    "moreover , the probability distribution @xmath46 allows to determine the probability that the modulus of the output population difference is greater or smaller than a certain threshold . in fig .",
    "[ fig : single_mzi_s200 ] we took the threshold @xmath48 .",

    "please note that @xmath54 due to the bi - stochastic nature of these quantum probabilities  @xcite .",
    "this means that the analysis of the measurement outcomes of the detectors located behind the bs ( @xmath55 ) allows to forecast the distribution of the initial population difference ( @xmath12 ) in the input fock states .",
    "therefore , the plot of @xmath56 is identical to the plot of @xmath57 in fig .",

    "for concreteness , we assume the modes to be linear polarizations @xmath66  horizontal , @xmath67  vertical .",
    "the input state impinges on a biased beam splitter with small reflectivity ( e.g. 10:90 ) .",
    "the reflected beam @xmath68 is sent to a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) , oriented such that it selects the unbiased polarization modes ( @xmath69 ) with respect to the incoming linear polarizations ( @xmath70 ) . in this case , the action of the polarizing beam splitter @xmath71 is the same as @xmath72 ( @xmath73 , @xmath74 ) .",

    "the only difference is that now the incoming state impinging on the pbs is not a single fock state but a superposition of those",

    "the outcomes @xmath83 and @xmath35 parametrize the family of non - gaussian filters in fig .",
    "[ filter]b because they allow to choose the shape of the probability distribution of @xmath81 .",
    "since the reflected @xmath68 and transmitted @xmath84 beams in the feed - forward loop are correlated , @xmath83 and @xmath35 also allow to estimate the distributions for the total photon number and population difference between the polarization modes in the incoming ( @xmath45 ) and transmitted ( @xmath85 ) beams , which are symmetric like those in fig .",
    "[ fig : single_mzi_s200 ] .",
    "this is the second important effect exploited by the filter .",
    "it is especially pronounced for larger photon numbers .",
    "for example , in case of the 10:90 beam splitter we most often obtain @xmath86 , @xmath87 . knowing the distributions of @xmath88 and @xmath89 , the analysis box checks the probability that they fulfill certain desired condition @xmath90 ( e.g. @xmath91 ) .",
    "if the probability is high enough , the box opens the shutter and passes the transmitted beam for further processing .",
    "if the probability is too small , the shutter remains closed and the transmitted beam is blocked .",

    "[ filter]b could be caused for example by the errors in the photon counting process ( e.g.  arising in the detector electronics ) .",
    "they result in lower ( e.g. losses ) or greater ( e.g. dark counts ) number of registered photons than expected .",
    "this process is independent for both detectors placed at the outputs of the polarizing beam splitter ( fig .",
    "[ filter]a ) . as a result ,",
    "a detector could register a different fock state @xmath175 than @xmath176 which really leaved the pbs .",
    "this is represented by some distribution @xmath177 giving the probability of registering the state @xmath175 instead of state @xmath176 . here , @xmath178 .",
    "the distribution @xmath177 represents a detector characteristics .",
    "it transforms the quantum state before the shutter @xmath124 ( eq .  ( [ bzyk ] ) ) to a mixed state @xmath179 @xmath180 the imperfect detectors , which turn the pure output quantum state into a mixed one , may significantly affect the coherent action of the filter .",
    "according to the formula ( [ mixedfiltered ] ) , the filter will now perform the following operation @xmath181 with @xmath182 . in order to examine its influence on the output state ,",
    "it is necessary to compute the purity of @xmath179 : @xmath183 .    in our first model ,",
    "the detector non - unit efficiency @xmath184 is simulated with an additional beam splitter put in front of each ideal photon counting detector .",
    "the transmitivity of these beam splitters is equal to @xmath185 .",
    "the detector , instead of projecting the incoming beam on the fock state @xmath186 , projects on a mixture of fock states @xmath187 with the binomial distribution @xmath188 in the limit of @xmath189 , @xmath190  the kronecker delta , which gives the result for perfect detectors .",

    "the most probable result is @xmath191 .",
    "therefore , this model includes only losses in the photodetector .    the second model of the imperfect detector",
    "is described by a gaussian distribution of a given standard deviation @xmath192 .",
    "this corresponds to the weierstrass transform ( known as the gaussian blur ) applied to the photon number distribution measured by the ideal detectors @xmath193 in the limit of @xmath194 , @xmath195  the dirac delta , which corresponds to the perfect detection .",
    "this model assumes that the most probably event is the detection of the actual photon number @xmath109 .",
