    "duality is an important phenomenon in quantum field theory allowing to relate two different theories .",
    "one example in @xmath0  @xcite is the equivalence between the self - dual ( sd ) model , which does not possess gauge invariance , and the gauge - invariant maxwell - chern - simons ( mcs ) model  @xcite",
    ". different aspects of this equivalence were studied in the literature , see for example  @xcite .",
    "the most important results of these papers were to establish the mapping between a massive thirring model and the maxwell - chern - simons theory , and between the self - dual model and the maxwell - chern - simons theory .",
    "the equivalence was also studied in the supersymmetric counterparts of the sd and mcs models , both in the free case  @xcite as well as in the presence of interactions with a scalar matter superfield  @xcite . however , as we will argue shortly , there remains some delicate intricacies which motivated us to reexamine the duality in the supersymmetric case .    in the present decade",
    ", a considerable interest has been devoted to the study of field theories in noncommutative spacetime and the possibility of lorentz symmetry violation , mainly due to their relevance to quantum gravity . in this context , the duality in a noncommutative spacetime was considered in  @xcite , and in the presence of lorentz violation in  @xcite .",
    "the duality between the models can in principle be proved within two frameworks .",
    "the first of them is the gauge embedding method  @xcite , whose essence consists in the extension of the self - dual model to a gauge theory by adding to its lagrangian carefully chosen terms that vanish on - shell .",
    "the equivalence of the resulting gauge model and the starting sd theory can be seen by comparing their equations of motion , and can also be tested at the quantum level . the second framework is the master action method , used for example in  @xcite , based on some primordial action ( the master action ) involving both the mcs and sd fields , coupled to some matter .",
    "integration of this master action over the mcs field yields the sd action , whereas integration over the sd produces the mcs action , with appropriate couplings to the matter in both cases .",
    "proceeding one step further , one can integrate over the remaining sd field in the first case , or over the mcs field in the second , finding the same effective self - interaction for the matter in both situations .    when the sd field is coupled to a bosonic matter ,",
    "one complication arises , in the sense that the model is actually equivalent to a `` modified '' mcs theory , with a field - dependent factor in front of the maxwell term  @xcite .",
    "the source of this complication is essentially the appearance of quartic vertices involving the matter and the vector fields . when considering the duality in the supersymmetric case , the most natural matter supermultiplet",
    "is represented by a scalar superfield , which also couples to the vector ( fermionic ) superfields with a quartic vertex , so the same difficulty arises : the supersymmetric sd model is equivalent to a modified mcs theory  @xcite .",
    "the presence of the quartic vertices also precludes an extension of the proof of the duality for noncommutative theories ( which , however , have been studied in the context of the seiberg - witten map , see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "one might wonder whether an interaction with a fermionic superfield , which does not induce a quartic vertex in the classical action , could make the study of the duality more transparent , and the aim of this work is to show that this is so , at least in the commutative case . the price to pay is that the fermionic matter superfield we have to introduce in such a study describes a non - minimal supersymmetric multiplet , involving four bosonic and four fermionic degrees of freedom .",
    "the structure of this work looks as follows . in section  [ classical ] , we present the master action , and use the equations of motion to establish the duality at the classical level . in section  [ quantum ] , we study the duality at the quantum level , by inspecting the generating of the smcs and ssd theories .",
    "all this work is made for quite general couplings ; some particular cases are discussed in section  [ instances ] . in section",
    "[ matter ] , the physical content of the fermionic matter superfield introduced by us is made explicit . in the summary ,",
    "the results are discussed ; in particular , we comment on the possible extension of our work to the noncommutative spacetime .",
    "as a first step , we introduce the following master lagrangian describing the interaction of a spinorial matter superfield @xmath1 with the spinor superfields @xmath2 ( which will be further identified with the self - dual superfield ) and @xmath3 ( which will be further identified with the maxwell - chern - simons superfield ) , @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the quadratic lagrangian for the spinor matter superfield @xmath6 ; @xmath7 and @xmath8 are currents depending on this superfield . explicit forms for @xmath5 and the currents will be presented later , at the moment , we can say that @xmath7 is necessarily conserved ( @xmath9 ) due to gauge invariance . here",
    "@xmath10 is the gauge invariant superfield strength constructed from the superfield @xmath3 .",
