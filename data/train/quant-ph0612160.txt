    "the stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) has been extensively studied in coherent population transfer @xcite . by partially overlapping pulses in the counterintuitive sequence ,",
    "we have the population efficiently transferred between two quantum states while almost not populating the intermediate level .",
    "thus the effect of spontaneous emission from the intermediate level is negligible .",
    "moreover , the stirap is independent of the pulse shape , which makes it robust against moderate fluctuations of experimental parameters @xcite . because of",
    "the above mentioned merits , many schemes concerning quantum information processing ( qip ) are based on the technique of stirap , such as single qubit rotation @xcite , controlled not gate @xcite , controlled phase gate @xcite , arbitrary state controlled - unitary gate @xcite , swap gate @xcite , generation of qubit entanglement @xcite and so on .",
    "all the above mentioned qip schemes are quite different from the dynamical ones @xcite , which need a precise control of the rabi frequency and the pulse duration .",
    "they are also quite different from the adiabatic geometric ones @xcite , which depend on a controllable loop in the parameter space . in ref .",
    "@xcite , an attractive scheme to generate multi - qubit controlled phase gate by only three steps in an optical cavity has been presented . as in refs .",
    "@xcite , it utilizes the cavity mode to couple different atomic qubits .",
    "although the dark states used for adiabatic evolution include no components of atomic excited state , they usually contain one photon or multi - photon cavity state .",
    "that is to say , the dark states are decoherence - free states with respect to the spontaneous decay , but not immune to the cavity decay .",
    "however , if the laser intensity is much smaller than the atom - cavity coupling strength @xcite , the population of the cavity state with non - zero photon can be very little . nevertheless , with a weak laser intensity , the pulse duration time",
    "must be much prolonged in order to fulfill the adiabatic condition @xcite , which would enhance the probability of dissipation .",
    "therefore , it is natural for us to ask how well the quantum gating in ref .",
    "@xcite works under the influence of dissipation . in the present paper",
    ", we will show how to generate all the conditional phase gates in a two - qubit grover search by the stirap technique , based on the main idea in ref .",
    "@xcite . to check the influence from spontaneous emission and the cavity decay",
    ", we will employ the quantum jump approach @xcite , which uses wave function to describe the system subject to dissipation while master equation employs density matrix .",
    "conditioned on no decay happening , the system s evolution is governed by a non - hermitian hamiltonian . in some cases ,",
    "quantum jump approach could help us find analytical solutions for systems subject to dissipation @xcite .",
    "but in the present case , due to complexity , we will have to numerically simulate the gating process and investigate the dependence of the success probability and the gate fidelity on the spontaneous emission rate @xmath0 and the cavity decay rate @xmath1 .",
    "the conditional phase gate is used for labeling target state in the grover search algorithm @xcite , which means an addition of a @xmath2 phase as a prefactor to the target state , but of nothing to other states .",
    "the target state labeling is a key step in grover search . for items represented by the computational states",
    "@xmath3 with @xmath4 in a quantum register with @xmath5 qubits , we have @xmath6 possible states .",
    "if the target state is @xmath7 , the conditional phase gate can be expressed as @xmath8 @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the @xmath11 identity matrix . by redefining the energy levels in ref .",
    "@xcite , we show that the second step in ref .",
    "@xcite to generate the two - qubit controlled phase gate is actually for a conditional phase gating to label the target state @xmath12 .",
    "atoms are fixed in the optical cavity , as shown in fig .",
    "1 , for an atom j with five - level configuration , where levels @xmath13 and @xmath14 are coupled to the excited state @xmath15 by two lasers with rabi frequencies @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively , while the level @xmath18 is coupled to state @xmath15 by the cavity mode with the coupling constant @xmath19 .",
    "these three couplings are needed to construct a two - qubit or even a multi - qubit gate .",
    "the couplings of the levels @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath18 to another excited state @xmath20 can be used to perform single qubit rotation as in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we encode the qubits in levels @xmath13 and @xmath18 , and for simplicity we focus our discussion on the case of two atoms , although our case is extendable to multi - atom cases .",
    "so our task is to accomplish @xmath21 i.e. , adding a minus sign to the target states @xmath22 where i , j being 0 , 1 , respectively and the subscripts are for different atoms .",
    "consider the pulses regarding @xmath23 and @xmath24 , the hamiltonian is given by ( assuming @xmath25 ) @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the annihilation operator for the cavity mode . as",
    "the cavity is initially in the vacuum state @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are unaffected by the hamiltonian , while @xmath31 and @xmath32 are associated with the hamiltonian s two dark states ( i.e. , eigenstates with zero eigenvalues ) @xmath33 respectively .",
    "the procedure consists of two stirap processes : ( i ) in the first stirap , @xmath24 precedes @xmath34 ; ( ii ) the second stirap is a reverse process of the first one but with the phase regarding @xmath24 added by @xmath2 . in the adiabatic limit and on the condition that the berry phase is equal to zero , we have @xcite ( assuming @xmath23 , @xmath24 having the same phase in ( i ) and @xmath35 ) @xmath36 thus the conditional phase gate for labeling the target state @xmath12 is generated .",
    "all the other conditional phase gates can be generated by adding the not gate on both sides of the above two stirap processes .",
    "it is easy to see @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 @xmath41 is the not gate acting on the @xmath42th atom , transforming states as @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 with the excited state @xmath47 , by three stirap processes : ( 1 ) @xmath48 precedes @xmath49 ; ( 2 ) @xmath50 precedes @xmath51 ; ( 3 ) @xmath52 precedes @xmath53 .",
    "the dark states associated with the above three steps are @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 respectively . in the adiabatic limit and with the condition of zero berry phase , we obtain in the case of the two pulses in each stirap with @xmath2 phase difference , @xmath57 as a result",
    ", we realize the not gate . alternatively",
    ", the not gate can also be reached by single qubit rotation as in ref .",
    "@xcite , which also needs 6 pulses .",
    "we introduce the spontaneous emission and the cavity decay from now on and will numerically analyze their effects on the conditional phase gate by the quantum jump approach . as long as there is no photon leakage either from the atomic excited state or from the cavity mode during the gating period , the hamiltonian in eq .",

    "@xcite , we suppose that the pulses have the gaussian shape @xmath76 $ ] with @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 . in fig .",
    "2 , we show the time evolution of the initial state @xmath80 . ideally , the final state would be @xmath81 . by our numerical calculation , with @xmath82 and @xmath83 , the probability amplitudes for states @xmath31 , @xmath59 , @xmath84 , @xmath30 are 0.4513 , -0.4523 , 0.5438 , 0.5438 respectively , and the fidelity is 99.12% while the success probability is 84.55% .",
    "the reason for the amplitudes of the components @xmath65 and @xmath30 increased compared with those in the initial state is that they did not participate in the evolution , while the other two components dissipated in the evolution .",
    "so the relative weights of @xmath84 and @xmath30 are enlarged in the normalized final state .    in order to see how the success probability @xmath85 and the gate fidelity @xmath86 depend on @xmath1 and @xmath0 , we plot @xmath85 and @xmath86 in each of figs . 3 , 4 , 5 , for the evolution from the initial states @xmath32 , @xmath31 , @xmath87 , respectively .",
    "3 , we see that @xmath85 is less affected by @xmath1 than by @xmath0 , while it is almost unaffected by @xmath0 in fig .",
    "since for the evolution of @xmath88 the occupation probability of @xmath61 is several times smaller than that of the excited atomic state , the spontaneous emission from the excited state @xmath89 is more detrimental than cavity decay in fig .",
    "3 . while for the evolution of @xmath31 in fig .",
    "4 , as the occupation in level @xmath90@xmath91 is negligible , the cavity decay is the main detrimental effect in this case . for an arbitrary initial state ,",
    "@xmath92 @xmath93 and @xmath94 are , respectively , the final states after time evolution of the component states @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 , @xmath98 are their corresponding success probabilities .",
    "thus the success probability for any initial state is latexmath:[$p_{suc}=|\\alpha|^{2}p_{suc1}+|\\beta    @xmath97 and @xmath98 are smaller than @xmath100 . as a result , for the same @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the less the initial population in components @xmath32 and @xmath31 , the higher the success probability for the gating process .",
    "moreover , from figs . 3 and 4 , we know that the fidelity is very high for the initial state @xmath59 or @xmath101 , which implies @xmath102 , while the relative weight ratio of the four component states @xmath32 , @xmath31 , @xmath84 , @xmath30 is approximately @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , deviated from the ideal case @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 .",
    "obviously , the fidelity for the state @xmath68 would be very high in the following two cases : 1 ) @xmath109 , @xmath110 ; 2 ) @xmath105 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 .",
    "therefore , it is easy to understand in fig . 5 why @xmath85 is increased in most regions while @xmath86 is decreased by comparing with those in figs . 3 and 4 with the same @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we also did the simulation for the not gate ( not shown ) , which shows that with intense short pulses and the vacuum cavity state , the fidelity and the success probability are both near unity even under large @xmath1 and @xmath0 . so the success probability and  the fidelity for the other three conditional phase gates would have almost the same dependence on @xmath1 and @xmath0 as in above figures .",
    "combined with single qubit hadamard gate , which is achievable by a series of single qubit rotations as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the performance of the two - qubit grover search by the conditional phase gates is straightforward @xcite .",
    "our scheme has the following advantages compared with ref .",
    "@xcite : atoms are fixed in the cavity , which is easier to control than the case with atoms going through the cavity with a certain velocity . moreover , all the operations are based on stirap , so they are very robust to fluctuation of experimental parameters .",

    "the fidelities are high enough , while the success probabilities need to be improved by reducing @xmath125 and @xmath126 in the future experiment .",
    "we have noticed a previous smart scheme @xcite for two - qubit phase gate , based on the stirap technique , by an almost same configuration as in the present paper . assisted by zeno effect , the state involved in adiabatic evolution in ref .",
    "@xcite is immune to both the cavity decay and spontaneous emission . from their simulation for a stirap process with fixed parameters @xmath82 and @xmath83 , we see the variation of the maximum rabi frequency and the detuning of the corresponding transitions of the atomic levels can lead to the maximum success probability and the high fidelity for the population transfer @xcite . in contrast , we did simulations in our work for successive two stirap processes without any change of the detuning and the pulse rabi frequency @xcite",
    ". given all the facts above and by comparing the simulation results , we consider that the proposal presented in ref .",
    "@xcite is not less effective than that in ref .",
    "@xcite in the presence of dissipation .",
    "moreover , ref .",
    "@xcite is applicable to multi - qubit phase gates , which would be used in multi - qubit grover search algorithm . but with more qubits involved , the dark states containing components with more photons , would be more sensitive to dissipation .",
    "however , with very high q cavity , ref .",
    "@xcite can be in principle feasible in the case of multi - qubit phase gates .    in summary",
    ", we have shown a generation of four conditional phase gates required by a two - qubit grover search algorithm by means of the stirap technique , in the presence of dissipation . to meet the requirement of adiabatic condition",
    ", the multiplication of the rabi frequency and the implementation time should be much larger than unity .",
    "but the larger the rabi frequency , the more the occupation probability in the cavity mode , yielding more probability of the cavity decay . on the other hand",
    ", the less rabi frequency would require a longer implementational time , which would also enhance the probability of dissipation . in this sense",
    ", it is of importance to find suitable numbers of above parameters .",
    "the numbers are fixed in our simulation , it would not be optimal for all the combinative values of @xmath127 and @xmath126 .",
    "but we have tried to used the numbers , which could result in relatively large values of @xmath85 and @xmath86 in the whole range of @xmath127 and @xmath126 .",
    "we believe that our numerical investigation for the success probability and the fidelity of the two - qubit conditional phase gate subject to the spontaneous emission and the cavity decay would be useful for real experiments .",

    "for a complete controlled phase gate , however , there should be two successive stirap processes .    for given values of @xmath127 and @xmath126 , we may vary @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 , the transition detunings to get the optimal values of @xmath85 and @xmath86 . however , our purpose is to illustrate how @xmath85 and @xmath86 depend on @xmath127 and @xmath126 .",
