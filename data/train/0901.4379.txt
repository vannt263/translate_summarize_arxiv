    "the interference channel is one of the fundamental building blocks of wireless networks .",
    "following several recent advances , the capacity region of the classical two - user gaussian interference channel is known exactly for some interesting special cases ( e.g. very weak or strong interference ) , and approximately ( within one bit ) for all channel conditions @xcite .",
    "there is also increasing interest in generalizations of the two - user gaussian interference channel model to more than @xmath3 users and fading channels .",
    "however these generalizations turn out to be far from trivial , as they bring in new fundamental issues not encountered in the classical setting .",
    "extensions to more than @xmath3 users have to deal with the possibility of _ interference alignment _ @xcite while extensions to fading channels are faced with the _ inseparability _ of parallel interference channels @xcite .",
    "interference alignment refers to the consolidation of multiple interferers into one effective entity which can be separated from the desired signal in time , frequency , space or signal level dimensions .",
    "the inseparability of interference channels refers to the necessity for joint coding across channel states . in other words , for parallel gaussian interference channels",
    ", the capacity can not be expressed in general as the sum of the capacity of the sub - channels .",
    "the following example presented in @xcite to establish the inseparability of parallel interference channels forms the relevant background for this work . consider the @xmath4-user gaussian interference channel with the channel matrix : @xmath5 where @xmath6^t,~{\\bf x}=[x_1,x_2,x_3]^t,~~ { \\bf z}=[z_1 , z_2 , z_3]^t$ ] are the vectors containing the received symbols , the transmitted symbols and the zero mean unit variance additive white gaussian noise symbols for users indicated by the subscripts .",
    "the transmit power constraint for each user is @xmath7\\leq p , k=1,2,3 $ ] . consider two different values of the channel matrix , @xmath8,~ { \\bf h}_b=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}1&1&-1\\\\-1&1&1\\\\1&-1&1\\end{array}\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is shown in @xcite that taken individually either channel matrix @xmath9 or @xmath10 by itself results in a sum capacity of @xmath11 , so that separate coding can at most achieve a capacity @xmath12 .",
    "however , taken together , the capacity of the parallel interference channel is @xmath13 which is achieved only by joint coding across both channel matrices .",
    "the key is the complimentary nature of the two channel matrices , i.e. @xmath14 which allows the receivers to cancel interference by simply adding the outputs of the parallel channels , provided the transmitters send the same symbol over both channels .    in this paper",
    ", we take this idea further by recognizing that in the ergodic setting , for a broad class of channel distributions , the channel states can be partitioned into such complimentary pairings over which interference can be aligned so that each user is able to achieve ( slightly more than ) half of his interference - free ergodic capacity at _ any _ snr .",
    "prior work in @xcite has shown that for fading channels every user is able to achieve half the channel degrees of freedom .",
    "in other words , each user achieves ( slightly less than ) half of his interference - free capacity asymptotically _ as snr approaches infinity_. fairly sophisticated interference alignment schemes are constructed to establish this achievability .",
    "however , in this work we show that for a broad class of fading distributions , including e.g. rayleigh fading , alignment can be achieved quite simply and more efficiently . in particular ,",
    "every user achieves ( slightly more than ) half of his interference - free ergodic capacity at any snr . note , however , that the stronger result is obtained at the cost of some loss of generality due to the assumption of ergodic fading and certain restrictions on the class of fading distributions , that are not needed in @xcite .",

    "[ sec : finite ] , we derive an achievable scheme for the finite field model in section [ sec : finite ] and in section [ sec : upper ] we show this matches the upper bound exactly . in section [ s : gaussian ] , we give an achievable scheme for the gaussian model which we show is quite close to the outer bound for the equal @xmath15 case for any number of users .",
