    "the main result of this paper , namely the analogue of the gauss - bonnet theorem for the noncommutative two torus @xmath2 , follows from the computation of the value at the origin , @xmath1 , of the zeta function of the analogue of the laplacian for non - unimodular geometric structures on @xmath2 .",
    "the two authors did this computation at the end of the @xmath3 s .",
    "the result was mentioned in @xcite , but it was never published except as an mpi preprint @xcite . at the time the computation was done , the result was formulated in terms of the modular operator but its significance was unclear . in the mean time the following two theories have been developed :    * the spectral action * the non - unimodular spectral triples    the spectral action @xcite , @xcite , allows one to interpret gravity coupled to the standard model from spectral invariants of a geometry which encodes a fine structure of space - time . in the two dimensional case",
    "the constant term in the spectral action is ( up to adding the dimension of the kernel of the operator ) given by the value at the origin , @xmath1 , of the zeta function .",
    "this value is a topological invariant in classical riemannian geometry .",
    "the twisted ( or non - unimodular ) spectral triples appeared very naturally @xcite in the study of type iii examples of foliation algebras .",
    "thus , in more modern terminology , our computation was that of the spectral action for spectral triples on the non - commutative two torus @xmath2 both in the usual and the twisted cases .",
    "initially , the complexity of the computation and the lack of simplicity of the result made us reticent about publishing it .",
    "it is only recently that , by pushing the computation further , we could prove the expected ( _ cf . _",
    "@xcite ) conformal invariance .",
    " let @xmath4 be an irrational number and consider , on the non - commutative two torus @xmath2 , a translation invariant conformal structure .",
    "let @xmath5 be an invertible positive element of @xmath6 considered as a weyl factor rescaling the metric .",
    "then the value at the origin of the zeta function @xmath7 of the laplacian of the rescaled metric is independent of @xmath5 .",
    "in fact we must retract a bit after stating this theorem since we have only performed the computation for the simplest translation invariant conformal structure but we do not expect that the general case will be different .",
    "there are two main actors in the computation and they display an interesting interplay between two theories which look a priori quite distinct , but use the same notation for their key ingredient :    * the spectral theory of the laplacian @xmath8 * the modular operator @xmath9 of states on operator algebras    the second is part of the scene because of the non - unimodularity of the spectral triple , or in simpler terms because the state defining the volume form is no longer assumed to be a trace and hence inherits a modular operator @xmath9 . while both the laplacian and the modular operator will be denoted by the capital letter delta , we hope the distinction between these two operators will remain clear throughout to the alert reader .",
    "recall that for a classical riemann surface @xmath10 with metric @xmath11 , to the laplacian @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the de - rham differential operator acting on functions on the riemann surface , one associates the zeta function @xmath14 where the summation is over the non - zero eigenvalues @xmath15 of @xmath16 ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
