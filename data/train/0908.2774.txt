    "early in 1968 , veselago predicted that a planar slab of negative - index material ( nim ) , which possesses both negative permittivity @xmath6 and negative permeability @xmath7 , could refocus electromagnetic waves  veselago . while an interesting prediction , these so - called metamaterials did not receive much attention in optics research until sir john pendry showed that nims could be used as a superlens , which could overcome the diffraction limit of conventional imaging system  @xcite .",
    "subsequently , a host of applications has been proposed , ranging from designs for optical cloaks to hide objects  @xcite , through to schemes that completely stop light  @xcite .",
    "although most of these schemes are idealized , and suffer in the presence of metamaterial loss , they have nevertheless motivated significant experimental progress .",
    "for example , schurig _",
    "et al_. experimentally demonstrated some cloaking features by split - ring resonators  @xcite ; and recent achievements in fabrication have facilitated the realization of negative indices at communication wavelength  @xcite , with some extension to quasi-3d structures also reported  @xcite .    while it is certainly becoming established that metamaterials posses some remarkable classical optical properties , less",
    "well studied are their quantum optical properties , such as what happens to the spontaneous emission of an embedded atom or quantum dot . in 1946 , purcell pointed out that due to the spatial variation of the local photon density of states ( ldos ) , the spontaneous emission rate in a cavity can be enhanced or suppressed depending upon the distance between the mirrors  @xcite .",
    "the modification of spontaneous emission due to inhomogeneous structures is a large field in its own right , leading to applications in quantum optical technology  @xcite . in the domain of metamaterials , kstel and",
    "coworkers investigated the spontaneous emission of an atom placed in front of a mirror with a layer of nim  @xcite ; this study was motivated by the perfect lens prediction of a vanishing optical path length between the focal points , leading to the peculiar property that the evanescent waves emerging from the source are exactly reproduced ; consequently they found that the spontaneous emission can be completely suppressed .",
    "this prediction does not account for the essential inclusion of metamaterial loss or absorption ; yet , it is well known that metamaterials must be dispersive and absorptive to satisfy the fundamental principle of causality and the kramers - krnig relation  @xcite .",
    "not surprisingly , when absorption is necessarily taken into account , then the predicted properties of an ideal lossless metamaterial can qualitatively change .",
    "for example , the superlens and the invisible cloak are never perfect  @xcite , and slow light modes can never be really stopped and are usually impractically lossy  @xcite .",
    "similarly , it is expected that absorption will have an important influence on the modification of spontaneous emission  @xcite . in this regard , xu _",
    "et al_. have extended the works of kstel _",
    "et al_. to one dimensional right - handed and left - handed material layers and find that nonradiative decay and instantaneous radiative decay will certainly weaken the predicted inhibition of spontaneous emission  xu2006,xu2007 .",
    "some of the first theories to treat quantum electrodynamics near a interface were introduced around 1984 by wylie and sipe  @xcite , where , using green function techniques , they showed that the scattered field can be expressed in terms of the appropriate fresnel susceptibilities .",
    "using such methods , it is now well known that the photonic ldos can be increased near a metallic surface , e.g. see ref .",
    "@xcite , whereby the @xmath0polarized dipole couples to a transverse magnetic ( tm ) surface plasmon polariton ( spp ) .",
    "typically such resonances are far from the optical frequency domain and they are restricted to tm polarization ; in addition , the emission is dominated by quenching or non - radiative decay . even in the presence of gratings , enhanced emission via",
    "spps is not very practical  @xcite .",
    "however , the rich waveguide properties of metamaterials have quite different polarization dependences and mode structures than ssps at a metal surface ; for example , they can support slow - light , bound propagation modes and transverse electric ( te or @xmath1polarized ) spps .",
    "it is therefore of fundamental interest to explore the quantum optical aspects of these novel waveguides .",
    "enhanced emission at the surface of both metals and metamaterial slabs was studied in 2004 by ruppin and martin  @xcite .",
    "they noted that resonance peaks due to @xmath1polarized surface modes and waveguide modes can appear for the metamaterial case , although they did not discuss the origin of the waveguide peaks .",
    "similar findings were found by xu _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , but the role of loss was not explored in detail but rather it was treated as a perturbation and assumed to lead to only dissipation ; such an assumption is highly suspect in a nim waveguide , since the entire modal characteristics of the structure depend intimately upon the material loss and dispersion profiles @xcite .",
    "very recently , spontaneous emission enhancements in nim materials and interesting quantum interference effects have been reported by li _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , although unrealistically small losses were typically assumed , and again the physics behind the enhancement factors was not made clear . in all of these works , there has been no quantitative connection made to the complex band structure or to the far - field ( and thus measurable ) spontaneous emission spectra or dipolar frequency shifts ( lamb shifts ) .    in this work",
    ", the modified spontaneous emission of a quantum dot or atom ( single photon emitter ) situated above a slow - light metamaterial waveguide is investigated in detail by employing a medium - dependent green function theory and comparing with the lossy guided waveguide modes .",
    "we compute the pf as well as the spontaneous emission spectrum in the far field by developing and using a rigorous quantum optics theory .",
    "we stress that the recent prediction of completely stopped waveguide modes in a metamaterial waveguide  @xcite would lead to an infinite pf , but as reported by reza  _ et al_.  @xcite , the properties of the slow - light modes are significantly changed in the presence of loss ; thus we also investigate the dependence on loss in some detail .",
    "we show that the emission properties of a photon emitter can act as a probe for below light - line propagation mode characteristics , showing measurable enhanced radiative broadening and quantum lamb shifts .",
    "the lamb shifts are found to be extremely rich and pronounced .",

    "these curves come from the complex solution to the transcendental dispersion equation derived from the maxwell s equations and the guidance conditions  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : band_structure_complex_omega ] , we show the first few tm ( te ) propagation modes : tm2-tm6 ( te2-tm6 ) , as well as te0-te1 ( tm0-te1 ) spp modes ( red curves ) ; a wide range of frequencies is displayed from from 180 to 240thz .",
    "we stress that the _ te - polarized _ spps are unique to metamaterials and the properties of these ssp modes can be engineered to have a resonance in the optical frequency regime , near the propagation modes . for the tm case ,",
    "there is also a higher - lying spp resonance , which we do not show as it is far outside the frequency of interest ( @xmath43thz or specifically @xmath44 ) ; the tm0 and tm1 modes show the start of the spp modes just below the air light line .",
    "the properties of these metamaterial waveguide modes shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : band_structure_complex_omega ] are considerably different from those in a conventional dielectric waveguide  @xcite .",
    "the most important difference is that backward and forward propagating modes exist and , in a lossless metamaterial waveguide , even stopped - light modes ( where the slope goes to zero ) are supported .",
    "however , the necessary inclusion of intrinsic loss in a metamaterial slab dramatically changes the dispersion curves near slow - light regions ( see also ref .",
    "thus one must include material losses to have any confidence in the results and predictions . in the complex@xmath29 solutions ( fig .",
    "2 ) , although the slope and thus the group velocity @xmath45 is zero at some points , the use of the group velocity as a measure of energy transport is not meaningful  @xcite , and there is a finite imaginary part of frequency .",
    "we note , however , that at the points where the slope is zero in fig .",
    "[ fig : band_structure_complex_omega](a ) and ( c ) , the density of modes is large and as we shall see , this can lead to a large purcell factor at the relevant frequencies .",
    "we note in particular that because the slope of all of the different mode dispersions tends to zero as @xmath46 goes to infinity , there is a large enhancement in the density of states at @xmath47 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : band_structure_complex_beta ] we show the dispersion curves using the complex@xmath48 approach . in this approach",
    ", the impact of material losses on the dispersion curves are much more drastic and these curves would appear to have little to do with the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : band_structure_complex_omega ] .",
    "however , despite their differences , there is a strong correspondence between the two sets of curves . in a ( fictitious ) lossless waveguide",
    ", the two sets of curves would be identical apart from some leaky modes that carry no energy .",
    "in the complex@xmath48 approach , two degenerate leaky modes start at the zero - slope point of the non - ssp propagation modes and move to higher frequencies . in fig .",
    "[ fig : band_structure_complex_omega ] , these leaky modes split and merge seamlessly into the propagation mode dispersion , creating the split - curve structure that is seen , e.g. for the te4 mode near @xmath49thz .",
    "although the slope no longer goes to zero in the complex@xmath48 approach at the point where the propagation mode splits into the two leaky modes , the energy velocity ( which is the correct measure of energy transport in a lossy system ) is quite small but nonzero .",
    "another important difference between the modes in the complex@xmath48 approach and the complex-@xmath50 approach is that for the modes in the complex@xmath51 approach , @xmath52 as @xmath53 , while in the complex@xmath48 approach , the modes bend back on themselves at the atomic resonance frequency @xmath23 .",
    "note that the group velocity , which is given by the slope of dispersion curve , is infinite at this point .",
    "there is no paradox here because , as discussed above , the group velocity is ill - defined in a lossy waveguide structure and the energy velocity is a correct measure of the transport speed  @xcite .",
    "we have calculated the energy velocity and find that the minimum _ energy _ velocity occurs exactly at the resonance frequency @xmath54 , but that it is never zero ; for example , the energy velocity minimum for both te3 and tm3 modes is found to be around @xmath55 to @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the vacuum speed of light .",
    "a similar effect occurs for te modes near the plasmon resonance , where in the in the complex@xmath48 picture , the ssp modes not only penetrate below the plasmon frequency , but they transform seamlessly into the higher - order leaky modes . for example , the te4 and te5 modes merge into ssp modes .",
    "interestingly , in fig .",
    "3(b ) , we also observe new resonances in the left branch of the leaky te propagation modes , which couple to the te spp modes just below the bare spp resonance .",
    "thus , two resonances appear in this spp frequency regime ; evidently , this is not expected from the complex@xmath29 perspective .",
    "later , we will show that the resonant frequency and the slow light regimes of the propagation modes are exactly coincident to that of the ldos peaks in the spontaneous emission spectrum , and thus both complex@xmath29 and complex@xmath30 band structures are useful to gain insight into the origin of the ldos peaks .",
    "the spatial symmetries of the even and odd modes will also prove to be very important ; since the odd modes have a much larger field amplitude at the surface , they couple much more strongly to a quantum dot or atom near the nim surface .",
    "the pf is a measure of the spontaneous emission rate enhancement ; it is defined as @xmath58 , where @xmath59 ( the einstein a coefficient ) is the spontaneous emission rate associated with population decay rate from an excited state to the ground state , and @xmath60 is the spontaneous emission rate in vacuum or a lossless homogeneous medium .",
    "we consider a system consisting of a quantum dot embedded in or near a general dispersive , absorptive , and inhomogeneous medium .",
    "employing a quantization scheme that rigorously satisfies the kramers - krnig relations , and using the electric dipole approximation , an appropriate hamiltonian  following the works of welsch and coworkers  can be written as  @xcite : @xmath61\\cdot \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{r}_{d}),\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the continuum bosonic - field operators of the electric ( @xmath64 ) and magnetic field ( @xmath65 ) with eigenfrequency @xmath66 , @xmath67 are the pauli operators of the electron - hole pair ( exciton ) , and @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( @xmath70 is assumed to be real ) are the transition frequency and dipole moment of the dot , respectively .",

    "the motivation behind investigating slow light waveguides in the context of enhanced spontaneous emission is that , quite generally , the relevant contribution to the ldos from a lossless waveguide mode is inversely proportional to the group velocity @xcite , and so slow light modes may lead to significant pfs . in the field of planar",

    "this enhancement leads to an increase in the degree of light - matter interaction , and is important for fundamental processes such as nonlinear optics , and for applications such as single photon sources .",
    "the major difference with lossless photonic crystal waveguides and nim waveguides is that the nim losses will likely mean that they are unlikely to find practical application as efficient photon sources , since the photon emission is probably dominated by non - radiative decay .",
    "nevertheless , it is fundamentally interesting to calculate the emission enhancements rates , and to connect these to a measurement that would allow direct access to this enhanced light - matter interaction regime .    for our pf calculations ,",

    "however , there are methods to improve these foms as they are not fundamental material properties ; for example , soukoulis _ et al . _",

    "when @xmath157 is decreased to 0.2thz , the pf increases significantly to @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "the physical origin of these large pf enhancements comes from the slow energy velocities of the propagation modes .",
    "this can be seen from the dispersion curves ( fig .  2 and fig .",
    "3 ) , where upon close inspection , we realize that we are obtaining the odd mode resonances , as is expected from dipoles near the surface where the local field is larger near the nim surface ; for example , the resonance around 207thz corresponds to the @xmath177 region of the te3 mode ( cf .   fig .",
    "2(c ) on the complex@xmath29 band structure ) . in the complex@xmath48 dispersion curves ( fig .",
    "3(b ) ) , this same resonance is seen as the point where the two branches of the te3 mode split apart near 207 thz ( @xmath178 m ) .",
    "the series of peaks below 200thz and above @xmath179 are due to the slow group velocity region of the various odd modes , which approach one another at @xmath179 .",
    "in addition , we note that for the te modes , there is a pf peak due to the plasmon resonance around 223thz that has also been highlighted elsewhere , e.g. refs .",
    "what is particularly interesting , is that for reduced losses , this resonance splits into two ( cf .",
    "4(b ) ) ; moreover , by inspection of the band structure ( cf . fig .",
    "3(b ) ) , the lower - lying peak of this pair is actually due to the bound propagation modes ( e.g. , te5 ) , which is only visible in the complex@xmath30 band structure .",
    "for larger losses , these individual peaks can not be resolved , and one must then assume that the broadened peak near 223thz for @xmath172thz , is due to a combination of the te spp and bound modes contained within the light lines .",
    "we emphasize that this resonance , which is below the spp frequency , is _ not _ observable with the complex@xmath29 band structure , as discussed earlier ; it is alo unique to the nim structure .     for a loss factor of @xmath180 ..  the solid blue and red curves correspond to the pf at @xmath34 for tm and te modes respectively and the dashed red curve corresponds to the te spp mode .",

    "the curve labelling is the same as in ( a ) .",
    "all curves are obtained at a fixed frequency . , scaledwidth=40.0%,scaledwidth=30.0% ]    next , the pf for different dot positions @xmath11 is investigated .",
    "similar to what happens near metal surfaces , as the dot is brought closer to the nim slab surface , the pf will increase rapidly and formally diverge at the surface of the nim slab .",
    "in fact , it is a straightforward exercise to show analytically that the electrostatic @xmath102 at the surface of a half - space lossy structure has an imaginary part that diverges .",
    "one finds for the non - retarded terms ( quasi - static approximation )  @xcite : @xmath185 , where the minus and plus sign refer to te and tm polarization respectively , @xmath186 is for free space , and @xmath187 is the permittivity of the nim medium .",
    "because @xmath188 diverges , any amount of loss in @xmath187 , no matter how small , will lead to a divergent ldos at the surface .",
    "consequently , the quasi - static approximation will not work at the surface , and in general we should consider distances significantly larger than the emitter size if we are to employ the dipole approximation .",
    "figure [ fig:3](b ) shows the dependence of the values of the pf at three different resconance peaks on the position @xmath11 . because of the expected ldos divergence at the surface",

    "we have fixed the frequency .",
    "the pf enhancements are found to decrease as a function of distance , as expected , but large values can still be obtained at distances ( @xmath193 ) or more .  for example",
    ", the tm peak has a pf of 10 at a distance of 100 nm from the surface . for metal surfaces , the tm spp mode pf scales as @xmath182 for small distances ( e.g. see ref .",
    "joulainprb2003 ) , which we have also verified for our structure ( see fig .",
    "this behavior is due to the electrostatic scaling of the evanescent contribution from the spp , and for our structure , this scaling dominates for distances of around @xmath194 .",
    "however , the scaling of the metamaterial modes is quite different : we obtain a scaling of around @xmath181 for the pf peak at @xmath23 and also for the te spp mode peak . in the limit of @xmath195",
    ", we again recover the @xmath182 scaling for these modes .",
    "also in the case of the metamaterial , significant pfs can still be achieved for much larger distances away from the surface , even for @xmath196 .",
    "the reason for this unexpected scaling is that the chosen resonance frequencies have not yet recovered the electrostatic limit , even for dipole distances as small as 7 nm from the surface ; if we choose frequencies away from the waveguide peaks , then we indeed get the the @xmath182 scaling from the nim , as expected .",
    "the dependence of spontaneous emission on the damping factor is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig:3](b ) , which shows that increasing the damping factor decreases the peak spontaneous emission rate , while increasing the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the pf resonance .",
    "however , even in the presence of very large losses ( e.g. , @xmath19710thz ) , we see that large pfs are still achievable .",
    "as expected , clearly there is also a large improvement in the pf enhancement if the nominal losses can be improved by an order of magnitude .",
    "the lamb shift is another fundamental quantum effect whereby the vacuum interaction with a photon emitter can cause a frequency shift of the emitter  @xcite .",
    "cavity qed level shifts of atoms near a metallic surface have been shown to be significant as one approaches the surface  @xcite . for optimal coupling ,",
    "usually these are studied at high frequencies ( e.g. , @xmath198ev ) , so as to couple to the tm spp resonance ; as a function of frequency , the level shift changes sign as we cross the resonance  @xcite . for lower frequencxies , a @xmath182",
    "van der waals scaling again occurs  @xcite .",

    "fig : lamb_shift(b ) , respectively .",
    "our calculations indicate that the frequency for a dipole above the nim slab will be significantly red - shifted relative to vacuum , with rich frequency oscillations as one sweeps through the nim waveguide resonances .",
    "the lamb shift at the @xmath179 resonance frequency for different loss factors @xmath204 are identical , and are not zero ; the nonzero shift at the main resonant frequency @xmath23 is due to the asymmetry of the pf , namely the series of waveguide resonances at the higher frequency end of @xmath179 .",
    "the frequency shift at @xmath23 for tm modes is 6.3ghz , and for te modes is 3.5ghz , and the difference between them mainly comes from tm spp modes at @xmath205thz . when the loss is reduced , the various modal contributions become more pronounced .",
    "it is worth highlighting that this frequency shift , which is completely unoptimized , is already comparable to some of the largest shifts reported for the real - index photonic crystal environment , e.g. , @xmath206 , over a wide frequency range .",
    "this ratio is even larger for smaller distances ( and larger dipole moments ) , however one must watch that the dipole approximation does not breakdown .",
    "we also remark that these nim lamb shift features are substantially different to those predicted in typical metals .",
    "for example , we have calculated the lamb shift from a half space of aluminium and find that the lamb shift in the same optical frequency regime is only -0.1ghz , for an identical dipole and position .",
    "although closer to the spp resonance ( which is at 2780thz ) , much larger values ( @xmath207 at @xmath208 nm ) can be achieved , the frequency dependence is relatively featureless , in contrast to that shown in fig . 6 and the spontaneous emission is very strongly quenched in metals near the ssp resonance .    finally , we turn our attention to the spontaneous emission radiation that can actually be measured . in the following , we use eq .",

    "the shift is @xmath214ghz and the enhancement in the spontaneous emission rate is 135 .",
    "usually , with a large dipole moment of @xmath215d and a spontaneous emission enhancement on the order of @xmath216 , the the photon - dot interaction will enter the strong coupling regime and the emitted spectrum will show a typical spectral doublet .  however , since the emitted field away from the nim is predominantly carried away by radiation modes , there the far field contains signatures of the qd coupling , even to near fields ; however , because there is quenching in the far - field emission , strong coupling is not observable in the far field from the nim waveguide - such effects could possibly be observed in the near field given suitable detection capabilities , e.g. , from a scanning near field optical microscope .",
