    "we have also discussed symmetry breaking mechanisms and the quantum interference correction in a quasi-1d ( strip ) geometry .",

    "the coefficient in front of @xmath293 ( where @xmath294 ) was found to be consistent with 1/2 , as expected for the 1sp regime . in higher magnetic fields , a crossover to negative magnetoresistance was observed that could be presumably attributed to wl .",

    "the wal behavior was observed both for normal - gap and inverted - gap structures in the whole range of magnetic fields and gate voltages .",
    "this is consistent with the 1sp behavior as expected from the above theory in the quasi-1d regime .",
    "indeed , boundaries of the strips break the block - wise tr symmetry , as has been shown in sec .",
    "[ s2.3 ] . furthermore , diffuse boundary scattering due to short - range edge irregularities is favorable for the violation of the @xmath34 symmetry at the boundary , which breaks down the spin symmetry , yielding the 1sp regime .",
    "in addition , the block mixing arises also due to the bia , see ref .  , and due to short - range impurities located within the quantum well .",
    "the difference in the magnitude of the effect for normal - gap and inverted - gap setups observed in ref . can be possibly related to a stronger block mixing in the inverted case ( cf .",
    "[ fig1dbm ] ) and/or stronger dephasing in the normal case .",
    "a stronger block - mixing in the inverted case might possibly be attributed to the higher probability of having irregularities ( background short - range impurities or edge roughness ) breaking the @xmath34 symmetry of the sample within a thicker qw ( inverted band ordering ) as compared to a thin qw ( normal band ordering ) .",
