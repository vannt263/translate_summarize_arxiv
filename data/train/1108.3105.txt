    "any approach to time series analysis begins with the question : is the data stochastic or deterministic @xcite ? often , the answer may be `` both '' : the data could be generated by a deterministic system with a noisy component , perhaps due to measurement or computer round - off error . in this article , we propose an alternative possibility : the data could be generated by a sequence of deterministic dynamical systems selected by a switching process that itself could be deterministic or stochastic , i.e. , by an _ iterated function system _ ( ifs ) . for a detailed review of ifs dynamics ,",
    "see diaconis and freedman@xcite . if this were the case , then a useful goal is to identify the times at which switching between regimes occurs , as well as the number and forms of the deterministic components themselves . under the assumption that each deterministic system is continuous , we use topology to detect and separate the components of the ifs that are present in the output data .",
    "the main idea behind this approach is that the nearby state - space points can evolve in different ways , depending on the dynamical state of the ifs .",
    "such a model has some relation to the determination of states in a hidden markov model ; however , hidden markov models are typically discrete and stochastic  not continuous and deterministic .",
    "a primary challenge in this problem is that overlap between the images of distinct regime functions could cause their trajectories to locally coincide .",
    "the use of ifs models for physical systems is not new ; for example , broomhead , et al.@xcite used an ifs to model digital communication channels . in the current paper , we provide new tools to extract ifs models from experimental data and to determine the sequence of switching between regimes in the ifs .",
    "we believe the method proposed here will prove useful in a number of applications .",
    "for example , detection and separation of ifs components is closely related to the statistical problem of _ event _ or _ change - point detection _",
    "@xcite where time - series data is assumed to come from a statistical distribution that changes suddenly .",
    "applications where change - point detection plays a role include fraud detection in cellular systems , intrusion detection in computer networks , irregular - motion detection in computer vision , and fault detection in engineering systems , among many others @xcite .",
    "our underlying hypothesis is different than in the field of statistical change - point detection  we assume that each regime is deterministic . for example ,",
    "though change - point detection has been successfully applied to determine brain states from eeg data @xcite , eegs have also been shown to exhibit properties of low - dimensional chaos @xcite .",
    "indeed , low - dimensional dynamics occurs in diverse areas including physiology , ecology , and economics @xcite .",
    "we expect that the separation technique outlined below could be used to produce more - accurate models of regime shifts and the effects of rapid parameter changes that occur , e.g. in the onset of seizures , natural disasters , or the bursting of economic bubbles .",
    "given a time series that corresponds to measurements of a dynamical system , our goal is to develop a technique that will detect whether the series is generated by an iterated function system ( ifs ) and to distinguish its components .",
    "formally , an ifs is a discrete - time dynamical system that consists of a finite set of maps @xmath0 on a state space @xmath1 .",
    "a trajectory of the ifs is a sequence of state - space points , @xmath2 , together with a _ regime _ sequence @xmath3 with @xmath4 , such that @xmath5 without loss of generality , we may assume that each map occurs at least once in the regime sequence , since otherwise the missing maps could be eliminated .    in the standard study of ifs dynamics",
    ", the regime sequence is often taken to be a realization of some random process @xcite ; however , we only assume that we have access to a single trajectory that is generated by a particular realization .",
    "consequently , the selection rule for the regime sequence is immaterial ; indeed , it could just as well be a discrete , deterministic dynamical system . the standard theory , in addition",
    ", often requires that each @xmath6 is a contraction mapping , in which case the ifs is _ hyperbolic _ and has a unique attractor @xmath7 that is invariant in the sense that @xmath8 .",
    "we do not not need this assumption , and only assume that the trajectory lies in some bounded region of @xmath1 .",
    "we will assume that the time series corresponds to @xmath9 measurements on a particular state - space sequence , @xmath10 but that the regime sequence is unmeasurable or hidden .",
    "for example , one may be able to measure the position of a forced pendulum at a sequence of times , but the pendulum may have a sealed brake mechanism that sets a friction coefficient and that is controlled externally to the experiment .",
    "measurement of @xmath11 also implicitly includes that of its associated shift map @xmath12    it is often the case that a time series corresponds to a limited measurement , perhaps of one variable from a multi - dimensional dynamical system . in this case , the first step is to use delay - coordinate embedding to construct , as much as is possible , a topologically faithful image of the orbit a reconstructed state - space @xcite . we suppose that ( [ eq : gamma ] ) is this embedded time series .    the fundamental goal in this paper is _ detection and separation _ : to detect if @xmath11 is a trajectory of an ifs and to separate the regimes by recovering the sequence @xmath13 .",
    "this problem is relatively straightforward when @xmath11 is a subset of some _ non - overlapping _ region of the ifs , i.e. , a region @xmath14 such that @xmath15 for all @xmath16 . in this paper",
    ", we address a more - general situation in which @xmath11 could be sampled from an overlapping region of the ifs .",
    "a fundamental requirement for our separation method is that the maps @xmath6 are continuous  a reasonable assumption for the vast majority of physical systems .",
    "in particular , the image of a connected set under each @xmath6 must be connected . since for finite data sets ,",
    "the notion of connectivity makes no sense , we will instead use @xmath17-connectivity under the assumption that @xmath1 is a metric space with distance @xmath18 .",
    "a set @xmath19 is _ @xmath17-connected _ if there exists an @xmath17-chain connecting the points in @xmath20 , i.e. , for each pair of points @xmath21 there exists a sequence @xmath22 such that @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 for @xmath26 .",
    "let @xmath27 denote the set of @xmath28 points consisting of @xmath29 and its @xmath30-nearest neighbors in @xmath11 .",
    "for each such set there will be a @xmath31 such that @xmath27 is @xmath31-connected .",
    "the idea of our algorithm is as follows . for each @xmath17 that is not too small",
    ", there must be a @xmath32 such that the image of @xmath27 under a single map will be @xmath17-connected .",

    ", the minimal @xmath31 will be determined by the maximal distortion of the map . for the algorithm to work",
    ", the set @xmath11 must be dense enough so that for this @xmath31 , there are nearest neighbors , i.e. , @xmath33 .",
    "if @xmath17 is chosen to reflect this maximal , single - map distortion , then whenever the time - shifted image , @xmath34 , consists of a number of @xmath17-connected components , each component should reflect the action of a different @xmath6 .",
    "this idea is expressed visually in fig .",
    "[ fig : sepsketch ] .",
    "note that @xmath34 is not the same as @xmath35 , the set of nearest neighbors to the image of @xmath36 .    to obtain reasonable results the parameter @xmath17 must be selected carefully as it will determine the maximal number of nearest neighbors , @xmath28 .",
    "the number , @xmath37 , of regimes of the ifs is not more than the maximal number of components of @xmath34 .",
    "however , since sparsely covered portions of the data set could result in spurious components , we will select @xmath37 to be the number of components in the bulk of the images @xmath34 .     on a @xmath38-nearest neighborhood of a point @xmath39 results in two @xmath17-connected components that can be identified as @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "[ fig : sepsketch ] ]    given a time series @xmath11 that we suspect to be generated by an ifs , the detection and separation algorithm requires an appropriate value for @xmath17 .",
    "here we outline a possible algorithm .    *",

    "if there is more than one regime , their images should be disconnected for some choice of @xmath17 .",
    "the number of regimes @xmath37 is estimated to be the number of components in the majority of the @xmath34 ; this should be persistent over a range of @xmath17 and @xmath28 values . * ( separation ) select a set of @xmath44-nearest - neighborhoods , @xmath45 , that overlap and cover @xmath11 .",
    "points are identified to be from a common regime if they lie in overlapping neighborhoods and their images lie in @xmath17-connected components .    in the next section ,",
    "we illustrate this method on a simple example .",
    "as a simple example , consider the ifs generated by the two quadratic , planar diffeomorphisms @xmath46 the map @xmath47 is hnon s quadratic map with the canonical choice of parameter values @xcite ; the map @xmath48 is conjugate , via an affine change of coordinates , to hnon s map with parameters @xmath49 .",
    "we generate a single trajectory of this ifs by using a bernoulli process with equal probability to generate a sequence @xmath50 . a trajectory with @xmath51 points , shown in fig .  [ fig : ifs : trajectory ] ,",
    "has the appearance of two overlapping hnon - like attractors .",
    "note however , that since most points on @xmath11 are not iterated more than a couple of consecutive steps with the same map , @xmath11 is not just the union of the attractors of @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",

    "@xmath50 are chosen with equal probability .",
    "[ fig : ifs : trajectory ] ]    to recover the regime sequence from @xmath11 we must check for @xmath17-disconnected images of @xmath31-connected components . as a first step to determine an appropriate value for @xmath17 , we compute the distance between each point in @xmath11 and its nearest neighbor , i.e. , the diameter of @xmath42 .",
    "this is shown in panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : epsilonhist ] as a histogram .",

    "[ fig : epsilonhist ] indicates how these distances grow upon iteration : it shows the distance between the iterates of each of these nearest neighbors , i.e. , the diameter of @xmath43 .",
    "there are now two distinct distributions separated by a gap @xmath56 $ ] .",
    "this suggests that the dynamics underlying @xmath11 is discontinuous , and that a choice of @xmath17 in the gap may be appropriate .",
    "suppose that we did not know that the ifs ( [ eq : henon ] ) had two regimes  that only the trajectory @xmath11 of fig .",
    "[ fig : ifs : trajectory ] was available . to detect the number of regimes , we look at the number of @xmath17-components in the image of the sets of five nearest - neighbors , @xmath57 .",

    "when @xmath17 is as small as @xmath59 about 3% split into four or more components and when @xmath61 , only 0.3% split into three or more components .",
    "note that with the equal probability rule that we used for ( [ eq : henon ] ) , the probability that all five points in @xmath57 will be iterated with the same map is @xmath62 , which is confirmed in fig .",

    "[ fig : time : domain ] .",
    "this data set has been studied previously and shown to exhibit chaotic dynamics @xcite .",
    "the time delay embedding process we use to analyze the computer performance trace involves the estimation of two parameters : the time delay @xmath98 and the embedding dimension @xmath99 .",

    "based on the first minimum of the time - delayed average mutual information we choose @xmath100 instructions . after choosing the delay @xmath98 ,",
    "the next step in the embedding process is to estimate the dimension @xmath99 .",
    "a standard strategy for this is the `` false nearest neighbor '' approach of abarbanel and kennel@xcite .",

    "[ fig : firstreturn]seemingly reminiscent of three overlapping attractors from an ifs  prompted us to apply our regime - separation algorithm to this data .",
    "because the two ghosts are much more lightly sampled than the `` main '' triangle , our conjecture was that the ifs consisted of three functions and that the switching process prioritized one of the three . for the analysis",
    ", we chose @xmath104 .",
    "this choice is justified by observation of the histograms shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : row ] .",
    "figure [ fig : row](a ) is the histogram of the distances between each point in the time - series embedding and its nearest neighbor , i.e. , the diameter of @xmath105 in @xmath106 .",
    "figure [ fig : row](b ) , shows the histogram of distances between the same two points after iterating them both forward one time step , i.e. , the diameter of @xmath107 .",
    "the two ` humps ' indicate that , for a generic pair of nearest neighbors , the images of those neighbors are either within @xmath108 of each other ( iterates of the same @xmath109 ) , or further than @xmath108 apart ( iterates of different @xmath109 ) .",
    "we separated the ghosts as follows : for each @xmath110 , we examine the image of @xmath111 and its nine nearest neighbors .",
    "that is , if @xmath112 consists of two @xmath17-connected components , then we identify the members of the smaller component ( in cardinality ) as candidates for points on the ghost triangle .",
    "hence , we have a sequence @xmath113 such that @xmath114 is identified as a point on the ghost for @xmath115 .",
    "these points correspond to the lower ghost of fig .",
    "[ fig : firstreturn ] ; the second ghost is just an image of the first ",
    "a necessary result of the symmetry inherent in the time - delay embedding process .",
    "furthermore , we note that the occurrence of ghost points is _ strongly _ periodic , with a period of 215 measurements .",
    "this claim is motivated by the plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : ghostspacing ] .",

    "furthermore , the points on this graph that fall below the line @xmath120 are the result of an ` extra ' identification in the middle of a period . for example , the first two such points have coordinates @xmath121 and @xmath122 . since @xmath123 , one might hypothesize that the @xmath124 ghost identification is actually spurious .     of ghost indices .",

    "this analysis reinforces the hypothesis that there is a direct correspondence between the points on the ghosts and points in the time series that are periodically spaced by 215 measurements .",
    "moreover , each ghost point appears to be shifted exactly 200 cache misses from the main triangle .",
    "indeed , adding @xmath127 cache misses to each of the points identified as parts of a ghost triangle , produces a time series that has the embedding shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : adjustment ] .",
    "thus , for this case , not only is the regime identified , but the dynamics of the two components is shown to be simply related : by just a shift .",
    "there is one issue remaining before we can model this data as an ifs : we only have access to _",
    "measurements _ of the states of the ifs .",
    "that is , if @xmath1 is the state space of the computer system and @xmath128 is a collection of maps on @xmath1 , the observations correspond to the functions @xmath129 with a continuous measurement function @xmath130 that maps the state of the computer system to the number of cache misses that occur over the given time interval .",
    "it can be shown that the functions @xmath131 are sufficient for studying topological and geometric properties of the @xmath132 ; a more - detailed treatment of the function @xmath133 can be found in alexander et al.@xcite .",
    "thus , if @xmath134 denotes the dynamics associated with the main triangle , we can define @xmath135 , and @xmath136 , where @xmath137 .",
    "the ifs consists of the state space @xmath1 , the collection @xmath138 of continuous maps , and the sequence @xmath139 , where @xmath140 this model of the the cache - miss dynamics on the intel core2^^ rests on the assumption that @xmath48 and @xmath141 can be described completely in terms of @xmath47 . to verify this assumption",
    ", we tested for determinism in the _ adjusted _ dynamical system of fig .",
    "[ fig : narrow ] .",
    "we found that out of the 295 points so identified , only 16 failed to lie in an @xmath17-connected image set in the adjusted dynamical system .",
    "consequently , @xmath47 appears to be a continuous function and the ifs is an accurate model for this data set .",
    "much of the usefulness of this model originates from the fact that we have isolated the continuous function @xmath47 . in light of this , it is reasonable to assume that @xmath47 is representative of some low - dimensional dynamics that are present in the computer system , while @xmath48 and @xmath141 represent a secondary piece of dynamics  in this case , perhaps best described as ` deterministic additive noise ' .",
    "many techniques for time - series analysis , such as in mischaikow et al.@xcite , explicitly require the time series to be generated by a continuous function , and almost all of them implicitly require that it be generated by a _ single _ function .",
    "for example , in mytkowicz et al .",
    "@xcite , time - series analysis of the data of fig .",
    "[ fig : timedomain ] showed that it has a positive lyapunov exponent and fractal correlation dimension .",
    "however , our results show that that time series interleaves trajectories from different dynamical systems  a property that can trip up traditional time - series analysis techniques . in the data studied in mytkowicz et al .",
    "@xcite , this proved not to be an issue because a single @xmath47 overwhelmingly dominated the dynamics . when that is not the case , problems can arise with traditional methods , which are often formulated assuming the existence of long , uninterrupted deterministic trajectories . some techniques , such as those in mischaikow et al.@xcite , do not explicitly require uninterrupted trajectories . using our topology - based approach , one could pull apart the time - series data into individual regimes and study the dynamics of each of the @xmath132 independently .    in conclusion , we have described an algorithm for detection and separation of a signal that is generated by continuous , deterministic dynamics punctuated by regime shifts .",
    "the algorithm handles shifts that result from stochastic or deterministic processes : it applies whenever the dynamics are described by an iterated function system .",
    "time - series data from a computer performance analysis experiment were shown to fit this model .",
    "more generally , we claim that iterated function systems are a natural model for complex computer programs , which  we hypothesize  have regime shifts as their execution moves through different parts of the code .",
    "ifs models provide a natural framework for data analysis in a wide range of fields : whenever the physical system generating the data is characterized by continuous systems , that are punctuated by discontinuous regime shifts .",
    "another area in which the regime separation technique is particularly appropriate is digital communication channels . indeed",
    ", ( hyperbolic ) iterated function systems are known to provide useful models of these channels @xcite .",
    "a channel corresponds to an electrical circuit externally driven by a digital signal , and the discrete input signal corresponds to the regime sequence .",
    "thus , the behavior of the circuit corresponds to the actions of a discrete set of continuous dynamical systems .",
    "a fundamental problem in this context is _ channel equalization _ , the reversal of distortion that is incurred by transmission through a channel .",
    "this is precisely the determination of the input signal sequence from a sequence of output values ",
    "i.e . , regime separation .",
    "channel equalization is straightforward for linear dynamics because the ifs attractors in these situations tend to be non - overlapping .",
    "however , more - realistic , nonlinear ifs models have overlapping attractors .",
    "we believe that our methods can be successfully used for channel equalization in this context .",
    "challenges that remain to be addressed include finding an efficient implementation for high - dimensional data and dealing with systems that have traditional ( e.g. gaussian ) noise in addition to regime shifts .",
    "furthermore , we have not addressed the nature of the switching process itself .",
    "once the regime shifts have been determined , the next natural question to ask is whether or not the switching is deterministic or stochastic , and if one can determine the rule for switching between regimes .",

    "<S> an ifs is a discrete dynamical system in which each time step corresponds to the application of one of a finite collection of maps . </S>",
    "<S> the maps , which represent distinct dynamical regimes , may act in some pre - determined sequence or may be applied in random order . </S>",
    "<S> an algorithm is developed to detect the sequence of regime switches under the assumption of continuity . </S>",
    "<S> this method is tested on a simple ifs and applied to an experimental computer performance data set . </S>",
    "<S> this methodology has a wide range of potential uses : from change - point detection in time - series data to the field of digital communications .    </S>",

    "<S> this approach is that nearby state - space points can evolve in different ways , depending on the dynamical regime of the ifs ; the main challenge is that the components may overlap , causing their trajectories to locally coincide . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate this algorithm on two examples , a hnon ifs and an experimental computer performance data set . in both cases , we were able to segment the signals effectively , identifying not only the times at which the dynamics switches between regimes , but also the number and forms of the deterministic components themselves . </S>",
