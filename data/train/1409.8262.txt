    "magnetic reconnection is a fundamental plasma physics process in which magnetic field rearrangement and relaxation rapidly converts magnetic energy into particle energy  @xcite .",
    "reconnection is believed to drive many explosive phenomena in the universe , from earth magnetospheric substorms and solar flares to high - energy x - ray and @xmath4-ray flares in various astrophysical objects . quite often , the radiation spectra of these flares , and hence the energy distributions of the emitting particles , are observed to be non - thermal ( e.g. , characterized by power laws ) .",
    "therefore , understanding the mechanisms of _ nonthermal particle acceleration _ and determining the observable characteristics  such as the power - law index and high - energy cutoff  of the resulting particle distribution , is an outstanding problem in modern heliospheric physics and plasma astrophysics .    of particular interest in high - energy astrophysics",
    "is the role of _",
    "relativistic reconnection_which occurs when the energy density of the reconnecting magnetic field , @xmath5 , exceeds the rest - mass energy density @xmath6 of the ambient plasma , leading to relativistic bulk outflows and plasma heating to relativistic temperatures  as a potentially important mechanism for nonthermal particle acceleration to ultra - relativistic energies ( with lorentz factors @xmath7 ) in various astrophysical sources  @xcite .",
    "in particular , this process has been invoked to explain energy dissipation and radiation production in electron - positron ( pair ) plasmas over multiple scales in pulsar systems  e.g .",
    ", in the pulsar magnetosphere near the light cylinder , in the striped pulsar wind , and in the pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) @xcite .",
    "in addition , relativistic reconnection in pair and/or electron - ion plasmas is believed to play an important role in gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) @xcite and in coronae and jets of accreting black holes , including agn / blazar jets , e.g. , in the context of tev blazar flares @xcite .",
    "nonthermal particle acceleration is essentially a kinetic ( i.e. , non - fluid ) phenomenon .",
    "although fluid simulations with test particles have been used to study particle acceleration , particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations include kinetic effects self - consistently .",
    "a number of pic studies have investigated particle acceleration in collisionless relativistic pair - plasma reconnection @xcite ; the best evidence for nonthermal particle distributions was provided recently by  @xcite . whereas previous studies have identified _ power - law slopes _ of nonthermal spectra , the important question of the energy _ extent _ of these power laws has not been systematically addressed .    in this letter",
    "we present a comprehensive two - dimensional ( 2d ) pic investigation of non - thermal particle acceleration in collisionless relativistic reconnection in a pair plasma without guide magnetic field . in particular , we characterize the dependence of the resulting energy distribution function on the system size  @xmath1 and the upstream `` cold '' magnetization parameter @xmath8 ( relativistic reconnection requires @xmath9 ) . we find empirically that relativistic reconnection produces a high - energy spectrum that is well represented by a power law with exponential and super - exponential cutoffs:@xmath10 the different cutoffs serendipitously allow us to distinguish different scalings with @xmath0 and @xmath1 : @xmath11 depends on @xmath0 , while @xmath12 depends on @xmath1 ( here @xmath13 is the nominal larmor radius ) .",
    "equality of the two cutoffs , @xmath14 , defines a critical size @xmath15 separating the small- and large - system regimes .",
    "we find that for large systems ( @xmath16 ) , the energy spectrum of accelerated particles ( hence @xmath17 ) is essentially independent of  @xmath1 . importantly ( as we discuss later ) , @xmath18 is approximately the length at which a current layer , with thickness equal to the average larmor radius @xmath19 , becomes tearing - unstable and breaks up into multiple plasmoids and secondary current sheets . [ here , @xmath20 is the average dissipated energy per background particle , @xmath21 ; in our simulations @xmath22 , so @xmath23 . ]",
    "therefore , we propose that ( at least in 2d with an initially cold background plasma ) reconnection in the plasmoid - dominated regime yields a high - energy particle spectrum that is predominantly independent of system size @xmath24 .",
    "consequently , nonthermal particle acceleration in _ huge _ , astrophysically - relevant systems may be studied via merely _",
    "simulations , i.e. , with @xmath25 .",
    "this study focuses on reconnection in 2d without guide field ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "although some important differences in the reconnection dynamics emerge between 2d and 3d , such as the development of the drift - kink instability @xcite , the dimensionality is not believed to affect the particle energy spectra at late stages @xcite . working in 2d ( much less costly than 3d ) enabled investigation of large system sizes .",
    "we simulate systems of size @xmath27 with periodic boundary conditions and two antiparallel reconnection layers .",
    "the two layers begin as relativistic harris current sheets @xcite with upstream magnetic field @xmath28 and a peak drifting plasma simulation - frame - density @xmath29 ( at the layer centers ) that is 10 times the uniform background density  @xmath30 .",
    "a small ( 1% ) initial magnetic - flux perturbation facilitates reconnection onset .",
    "electrons and positrons in each harris layer drift ( in opposite directions ) with average velocity @xmath31 , and initial maxwell - jttner temperature @xmath32 ; the initial layer half - thickness is @xmath33 .",
    "the background plasma is initially at rest , with temperature @xmath34 ; however , due to the finite grid instability @xcite , the background plasma is expected to heat until its debye length is resolved , which occurs at a temperature of order @xmath35 for @xmath36 .",
    "the simulations begin with @xmath37 ( macro)particles per grid cell with cell sizes @xmath38 ( except for @xmath39 , where the mildly - relativistic particles allowed @xmath40 without sacrificing accuracy ) .",
    "the total energy is conserved within 1% during each simulation .",
    "convergence tests with respect to @xmath41 and @xmath42 indicate that our simulations are well resolved and , in particular , that the high - energy parts of the particle distributions are robust .",
    "the vorpal code @xcite , employed for this study , uses an explicit electromagnetic pic time advance , with yee electromagnetics and a relativistic boris particle push .    to determine the power - law index @xmath3 and the energy cutoffs @xmath17 and @xmath43 as functions of the upstream magnetization @xmath0 and the system size  @xmath1 , we ran simulations with @xmath0 = 3 , 10 , 30 , 100 , 300 , 1000 , and",
    ", for each  @xmath0 , a range of system sizes up to @xmath44 for @xmath45 , up to @xmath46 for @xmath47 , and up to @xmath48 for  @xmath39 .",
    "we focus on the energy distribution of background particles , excluding the initially - drifting particles , which contribute negligibly to the overall distribution for large @xmath1 .",
    "evolution to a nonthermal distribution proceeds rapidly ( fig .",
    "[ fig : distvstime ] ) ; and the shape of the high - energy spectrum , as characterized by @xmath3 and @xmath49 , ceases to evolve well before all available flux has reconnected , especially for large systems .",
    "we find that the late - time high - energy spectrum is a power law with a high - energy cutoff significantly above the average particle energy , in agreement with  @xcite .",
    "we further observe ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fits ] ) that spectra for large systems have exponential cutoffs , @xmath50 , while small systems have sharper cutoffs , which we empirically model with a super - exponential @xmath51 .",
    "we therefore fit all spectra with the universal form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dist ] ) to determine the power - law index @xmath3 and the cutoffs @xmath17 ,  @xmath43 ; for small systems , the best - fit @xmath17 is typically much larger than @xmath43 ( hence irrelevant and highly uncertain ) , while for large @xmath1 , @xmath43 is larger and uncertain .",
    "each spectrum is fit to eq .",
    "( [ eq : dist ] ) over an interval @xmath52 $ ] , chosen as large as possible while maintaining a good fit . because spectra depart from a power law at lowest energies , and because of increased noise at highest energies , larger fitting intervals yield unacceptably poor fits .",
    "noise is reduced ( and fit improved ) by averaging over short time intervals and , if available , over multiple simulations ( identical except for randomized initial particle velocities ) . because the choices of acceptable fit quality and the durations of averaging intervals are somewhat subjective",
    ", we perform many fits using different choices , and finally report the median values with `` error '' bars encompassing the middle 68% of the fits ( i.e. , @xmath53 standard deviation if the data were gaussian - distributed ) ; small error bars thus demonstrate insensitivity to the fitting process . very uncertain and large ( hence irrelevant )",
    "cutoff values are discarded .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     by applying this fitting procedure to the background particle spectrum for each different value of @xmath54 , we mapped out @xmath3 , @xmath17 , and @xmath43 as functions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , up to sufficiently large @xmath1 to estimate the asymptotic values @xmath55 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : alphavsl ] ) .",

    "[ fig : alphavssigma],width=325 ]    in contrast to the power - law index @xmath3 , the energy _ extent _ of the power law has received relatively little attention in relativistic reconnection literature @xcite .",
    "we find that the high - energy cutoffs scale as @xmath11 ( _ independent of _",
    "@xmath1 ) and @xmath12 ( _ independent of _",
    "@xmath0 ) ( figs .",
    "[ fig : gc1vssigma ] ,  [ fig : gc2vsl ] ) . thus @xmath61 implies @xmath62 , and a super - exponential cuts off the power - law at an energy determined by the system size .",

    "[ fig : gc2vsl],width=325 ]",
    "the scaling of the high - energy cutoffs can be explained in terms of the distance a particle could travel within the reconnection field @xmath65 ( where @xmath66 is the reconnection rate ) . by calculating analytic trajectories in fields _ around a single @xmath67-point _ , ref .",
    "@xcite concluded that @xmath68 with @xmath69 , with @xmath70 being the size of the reconnection region in @xmath71 , a result that was supported by 2d pic simulation in @xcite .",
    "in general , small systems reconnect mainly with one @xmath67-point , so @xmath72 and @xmath73 , which equals our @xmath43 .",
    "( the observed super - exponential form presumably results from the simulation s boundary conditions . )    in large systems , however , the tearing instability breaks up current layers with full - length greater than @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the layer half - thickness @xcite , resulting in a hierarchy of layers ending with _ elementary _ layers , which are marginally stable against tearing @xcite",
    ". the half - thickness of elementary ( single @xmath67-point , laminar ) layers should be about the average larmor radius @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "although @xcite considered single @xmath67-point reconnection , we propose that their formula for @xmath77 can also be used in the context of plasmoid - dominated reconnection in large systems if applied to elementary layers ( instead of the entire global layer ) : @xmath78 ( instead of @xmath72 ) .",
    "then , @xmath79 , which is essentially our @xmath17 ( and consistent with the measurement of @xmath80 for @xmath81 in @xcite ) .",
    "this explanation of high - energy - cutoff scaling in terms of elementary layer lengths may be robust despite the potentially important roles played by other acceleration mechanisms @xcite .",
    "for example , significant additional acceleration may occur within contracting plasmoids @xcite or  especially for the highest - energy particles  in the ( anti-)reconnection electric field of secondary plasmoid mergers @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to compare our high - energy cutoffs to the upper bound imposed on a power - law distribution by a finite energy budget .",
    "when @xmath82 , most of the kinetic energy resides in high - energy particles , so the available energy per particle @xmath83 limits the extent of the power law . if @xmath84 extends from @xmath85 to @xmath86 , then @xmath87 \\gamma_{\\rm min}^{\\alpha-1 } \\gamma_{\\rm max}^{2-\\alpha}$ ] @xcite . for @xmath88 ,",
    "@xmath89 can extend well beyond @xmath90 , but @xmath91 depends weakly on system parameters , consistent with our finding @xmath92 .",
    "e.g. , for @xmath93 , @xmath94 .",
    "however , when @xmath95 ( e.g. , for low @xmath0 ) , the energy budget imposes no upper bound , since @xmath96 is finite . nevertheless , for @xmath97 where @xmath98 , we observe @xmath99 , the same as for smaller @xmath59 .",
    "the exponential cutoff at energies above @xmath100 has important astrophysical implications for particle acceleration in systems such as pulsar magnetospheres , winds , pwn , and relativistic jets in grbs and agns .",
    "our results ( insofar as they are ultra - relativistic ) can be generalized to relativistically - hot upstream plasmas by scaling all the energies by @xmath101 , the average lorentz factor of background particles .",
    "the `` hot '' magnetization @xmath102 therefore parameterizes similar simulations , since the relativistic specific enthalpy @xmath103 also scales with @xmath101 [ i.e. , @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the background plasma pressure ; for @xmath106 , @xmath107 .",
    "for example , our reconnection - based model @xcite for high - energy @xmath4-ray flares in the crab pwn  @xcite relies upon acceleration of a significant number of particles from @xmath108 to @xmath109 . if , to achieve this , we need @xmath110 , then direct extrapolation of the results from this letter would require @xmath111",
    "; this should be comparable ( via scaling equivalence ) to simulations presented in this work with @xmath112 ( corresponding to a power - law index @xmath113 ) .",
    "this required @xmath114 is significantly higher than what is expected in the crab nebula .",
    "however , here we analyzed the entire spectrum of background particles , while @xcite suggested that bright flares observed in the crab nebula result from preferential focusing of the highest - energy particles into tight beams with energy spectra that differ from the entire spectrum .",
    "we also note that our present simulations are initialized with a maxwellian plasma , whereas the ambient plasma filling the crab nebula has a power - law distribution , which may result in a higher high - energy cutoff .",
    "we ran a series of collisionless relativistic pair - plasma magnetic reconnection simulations with no guide field , covering a wide range of system sizes @xmath1 and upstream magnetizations @xmath115 .",
    "we observed acceleration of the background plasma particles to a nonthermal energy distribution @xmath116 with a high - energy cutoff .",
    "the cutoff energy is proportional to the maximum length of elementary , single @xmath67-point layers , which is limited by @xmath1 in small systems , and by the secondary tearing instability in large systems . for small systems ( @xmath117 )",
    "we observe @xmath118 with @xmath119 , and for large systems , @xmath120 with @xmath11 .",
    "as @xmath1 becomes large , the power - law index @xmath121 asymptotically approaches @xmath56 , which in turn decreases to @xmath122 as @xmath123 .",
    "this characterization of power - law slope and high - energy cutoffs can be used to link ambient plasma conditions ( i.e. , @xmath0 ) with observed radiation from high - energy particles , to investigate the role that reconnection plays in high - energy particle acceleration in the universe .",
