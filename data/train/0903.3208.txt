    "let @xmath0 be a manifold with corners , of dimension @xmath1 i.e. , a manifold locally modeled on @xmath2 endowed with an incomplete metric , smooth and non - degenerate up to the boundary .",
    "we consider the wave equation @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the nonnegative laplace - beltrami operator ; we will impose either dirichlet or neumann conditions at @xmath6 as is well known by the classic result of duistermaat - hrmander ( see @xcite ) , the wavefront set of a solution @xmath7 propagates along null - bicharacteristics in the interior .",
    "however , the behavior of singularities striking the boundary and corners of @xmath8 is considerably subtler .",
    "indeed the propagation of singularities for the wave equation on manifolds with boundary is already a rather subtle problem owing the the difficulties posed by `` glancing '' bicharacteristics , those which are tangent to the boundary .",
    "chazarain @xcite showed that singularities striking the boundary transversely simply reflect according to the usual law of geometric optics ( conservation of energy and tangential momentum , hence `` angle of incidence equals angle of reflection '' ) for the reflection of bicharacteristics .",
    "this result was extended in @xcite and @xcite by showing that , at glancing points , singularities may only propagate along certain generalized bicharacteristics .",
    "the continuation of these curves may fail to be unique at ( non - analytic ) points of infinite - order tangency as shown by taylor @xcite . whether all of these branches of bicharacteristics can carry singularities is still not known .    as was shown initially in several special examples (",
    "namely those amenable to separation of variables ) the interaction of wavefront set with a corner gives rise to new , _ diffractive _ phenomena , in which a single bicharacteristic carrying a singularity into a corner engenders singularities releasing from the corner along a whole family of bicharacteristics .",
    "for instance , a ray carrying a singularity transversely into a codimension - two corner will in general produce singularities on the entire cone of rays reflected in such a way as to conserve both energy and momentum tangent to the corner ( see figure  [ figure : diffracted ] )        the first diffraction problem to be rigorously treated was that of the exterior of a wedge , which was analyzed by sommerfeld @xcite ; subsequently , many related examples were analyzed by friedlander @xcite , and more generally the case of exact cones was worked out explicitly by cheeger - taylor @xcite , @xcite in terms of the functional calculus for the laplace operator on the cross section of the cone . all of these explicit examples reveal that generically a diffracted wave arises from the interaction of wavefront set of the solution with singular strata of the boundary of the manifold ; this has long been understood at a heuristic level , with the geometric theory of diffraction of by keller @xcite describing the classes of trajectories that ought to contribute to the asymptotics of the solution in various regimes .",
    "subsequent work has been focused primarily on characterizing the bicharacteristics on which singularities can propagate , and on describing the strength and form of the singularities that arise .",
    "the propagation of singularities on manifolds with boundary was first understood in the analytic case by sjstrand @xcite , and subsequently generalized to a very wide class of manifolds , including manifolds with corners , by lebeau @xcite . in the @xmath9 setting employed here , the special case of manifolds with conic singularities was studied by melrose - wunsch @xcite and _ edge manifolds _",
    "( i.e. , cone bundles ) were considered by melrose - vasy - wunsch @xcite .",
    "vasy @xcite obtained results analogous to lebeau s in the case of manifolds with corners , and it is the results of this work that directly bear on the situation studied here .",
    "while the foregoing results characterize which bicharacteristics may carry singularities for solutions to the wave equation , they ignore the question of the regularity of the diffracted front . in general",
    ", we expect a singularity in @xmath10 ( which is to say , measured with respect to @xmath11 ) to propagate _ strongly _ , i.e.  certain `` geometric '' bicharacteristics through the point in question must also lie in @xmath12 in simple cases , these are known to be those which are locally approximable by bicharacteristics that miss the corners and reflect transversely off boundary hypersurfaces .",
    "more generally , we can define geometric bicharacteristics as follows : to begin , we _",
    "blow up _ the corner , i.e.  introduce polar coordinates around it ; this serves to replace the corner with its inward - pointing normal bundle , which fibers over the corner with fiber given by one orthant of a sphere , @xmath13 we will define _ geometric _ broken bicharacteristics passing through the corner as those that lift to the blown - up space to enter and leave the lift of the corner at points connected by _",
    "generalized broken geodesics _ of length @xmath14 with respect to the naturally defined metric on @xmath15 undergoing specular reflection at its boundaries and corners .. ] bicharacteristics that enter and leave the corner at points in a fiber that are not at distance-@xmath14 in this sense are referred to as `` diffractive . ''",
    "see figure  [ fig : cornerimp ] .",
    "it turns out that subject to certain hypotheses of _ nonfocusing , _ the singularities propagating along diffractive bicharacteristics emanating from the corner will be weaker than those on geometric bicharacteristics . in particular , the fundamental solution satisfies the nonfocusing condition , hence one consequence of our main theorem is as follows :    consider the fundamental solution @xmath16 to the wave equation , with pole @xmath17 sufficiently close to a corner , @xmath18 of codimension @xmath19 with a correspondingly short geodesic from @xmath17 to @xmath20 meeting each boundary face containing @xmath20 transversally . while @xmath16 lies locally in to mean @xmath21 for all @xmath22 . ]",
    "@xmath23 it is less singular by @xmath24 derivatives along diffractive bicharacteristics emanating from @xmath25 that is , it lies microlocally in @xmath26 there .    a more precise version of this result ( with `` sufficiently close  ''",
    "eludicated ) appears in corollary  [ corollary : fundsoln ] .",
    "a more general theorem on regularity of the diffracted wave subject to the nonfocusing condition is the central result of this paper .",
    "see  [ subsec : hypothesis ] for a rough statement of the nonfocusing condition and  [ section : coisodef ] for technical details ; the main theorem is stated and proved in ",
    "[ section : geometric ] .",
    "there are a few related results known in special cases .",
    "grard - lebeau @xcite explicitly analyzed the problem of an analytic conormal wave incident on an analytic corner in @xmath27 obtaining a @xmath28-derivative improvement of the diffracted wavefront over the incident one .",
    "the first and third authors @xcite obtained corresponding results for manifolds with conic singularities , which the authors subsequently generalized to the case of edge manifolds @xcite .",
    "we now describe the nonfocusing hypothesis in more detail , in the context of the simplest geometric situation to which our results apply .",
    "it is easily seen from the explicit form of the fundamental solution that it is not in general true that diffracted rays are more regular than incident singularities .",
    "for example , take @xmath5 to be the dirichlet laplacian in a sectorial domain @xmath29\\}$ ] in @xmath27 and consider the solution @xmath30 where @xmath31 is supported close to some value @xmath32 this solution is manifestly locally in @xmath33 by energy conservation .",
    "on the other hand one may see from the explicit form of the propagator in @xcite , @xcite after convolution with @xmath34 that a spherical wave of singularities emanates from the corner at time @xmath35 with regularity @xmath36 hence the same as the overall sobolev regularity of the solution .",
    "the bicharacteristics along which singularities propagate are , for short time , just the lifts of the straight lines @xmath37 @xmath38 hence travelling straight into or out of the vertex . perturbing these slightly to make them miss the vertex",
    ", we see that in fact there are two `` geometric '' continuations . ] for each bicharacteristic , depending on whether we approximate it by geodesics passing to the left or to the right of the vertex ( see figure  [ fig : cornerimp ] ) .",
    "thus , the geometric continuations of the rays on which singularities strike the vertex are close to the two possible continuations of the single ray @xmath39 hence do not include all points on the outgoing spherical wave .",
    "so we have an example in which there are `` non - geometric '' singularities of full strength .",
    "the nonfocusing condition serves exactly to rule out such situations .",
    "the above example has the property that applying negative powers of @xmath40 does not regularize the short - time solution ( or the initial data ) as it is already @xmath41 in the @xmath42 direction . in this simple",
    "setting , the nonfocusing condition says precisely that the solution is regularized by negative powers of @xmath43 or , equivalently , that it can be written @xmath44 for some @xmath45 exceeding the overall sobolev regularity .",
    "for instance , the fundamental solution @xmath46 looks , after application of a sufficiently negative power of @xmath43 like a distribution of the form @xmath47 with @xmath48 @xmath49 hence we can write @xmath50 for some @xmath51 at least locally , away from the boundary .",
    "we also observe that the example enjoys a property which is essential _ dual _ to the nonfocusing condition , to whit , fixed regularity under repeated application of @xmath52 we refer to this property as `` coisotropic regularity '' ( the terminology will be explained in  [ section : coisodef ] ) and it plays an essential role in our proof .",
    "the nonfocusing condition and coisotropic regularity in a more general setting are subtler owing to their irreducibly microlocal nature : the operator @xmath53 has to be replaced by a family of operators characteristic along the flowout of the corner under consideration .",
    "we now describe the logical structure of the proof , as it is somewhat involved .",
    "the heart of the argument is a series of propagation of singularities results , obtained by positive commutator methods . in order to be able to distinguish between `` geometric '' and `` diffractive '' bicharacteristics at a corner of @xmath54 we begin by performing a blowup of the corner , i.e.  introducing polar coordinates centered at it , to obtain a new manifold with corners @xmath55 the commutants that we employ in our commutator argument _",
    "almost _ lie in a calculus of pseudodifferential operators , the edge - b calculus , that behaves like mazzeo s edge calculus @xcite near the new boundary face introduced by the blowup ( henceforth , the _ edge _ ) and like melrose s b calculus @xcite at the remaining boundary faces .",
    "the complication , as in the previous work of vasy @xcite on propagation of singularities , is that in order to control certain error terms we in fact must employ a hybrid differential - pseudodifferential calculus , in which we keep track of certain terms involving differential operators normal to the boundary faces other than @xmath56    even this propagation result alone is insufficient to obtain our result , as it does not allow regularity of greater than a certain degree to propagate out of the edge , with the limitation in fact not exceeding the a priori regularity of the solution .",
    "what it does allow for , however , is the propagation of _ coisotropic _ regularity of arbitrarily high order , suitably microlocalized in the edge - b sense .",
    "this allows us to conclude that given a ray @xmath57 leaving the edge , if the solution enjoys coisotropic regularity along all rays incident upon the edge that are geometrically related to @xmath57 , then we may conclude coisotropic regularity along @xmath57 as well .",
    "( if some of these incident rays are glancing , i.e.  tangent to the boundary , we require as our hypothesis actual _",
    "differentiability _ globally at all incoming glancing rays rather than coisotropic regularity , which no longer makes sense ; the version of the commutator argument that deals with these rays is the most technically difficult aspect of the argument . ) in particular , then , _ global _ coisotropic regularity together with @xmath41 regularity at glancing rays implies global coisotropic regularity leaving the edge away from glancing .",
    "we are then able to dualize this result to show that the nonfocusing condition propagates as well .",
    "consequently , we show that subject to the nonfocusing condition , in the model case of the sector considered above , if @xmath57 is an outgoing ray such that the solution is @xmath41 along all incoming rays geometrically related to it , @xmath58 where in general @xmath59 for the fundamental solution near a codimension-@xmath19 corner on an @xmath60-manifold , hence @xmath61 for the sector . on the other hand",
    "the microlocal propagation of coisotropic regularity shows that @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the overall regularity of the solution ( @xmath64 for the fundamental solution ) .",
    "an interpolation argument then yields @xmath65 proving the theorem .",
    "let @xmath0 be a connected @xmath60-dimensional manifold with corners .",
    "we work locally , near a given point in the interior of a corner @xmath20 of codimension @xmath66 thus , we have local coordinates @xmath67 in which @xmath20 is given by @xmath68 .",
    "suppose that @xmath69 is a smooth riemannian metric on @xmath70 non - degenerate up to all boundary faces .",
