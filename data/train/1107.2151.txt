    "exploration of the excited states of hadrons opens a door into the nature of nonperturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . by mapping out the excitation spectra of hadrons",
    ", information is gained about their effective degrees of freedom and the effective forces that lead to confinement .",
    "a both particularly challenging and interesting task is to understand the spectra of baryons . although symmetric quark models , describing the baryon with three constituent quark degrees of freedom , are good at predicting many properties for many of the low - lying baryons ( especially the ground states ) , there is a large disagreement between the number of excited states predicted by these models and the number that has been observed at and , in particular , above masses of about 1.8  gev/@xmath7",
    ". attempts at finding a physical mechanism that can account for this discrepancy have not thus far yielded a satisfactory answer , and the higher mass regions of the excitation spectra remain largely unexplored : most known baryon resonances have masses smaller than 2  gev/@xmath7 and were discovered in elastic @xmath8 scattering experiments .",
    "many of the _ missing _ or hitherto unobserved baryon resonances are predicted to couple only weakly to the @xmath8  channel but exhibit large couplings to @xmath9 . in recent years , many different laboratories worldwide ( jefferson laboratory , elsa , mami , graal , spring-8 , etc . )",

    "a good review is given in  @xcite .",
    "although many of the _ missing _ baryon resonances may have a small coupling to @xmath8 , it is still important to study pion photoproduction .",
    "doing so may confirm or reject resonances seen in elastic pion - nucleon scattering , and it could still provide evidence for unexplored resonances .",
    "new resonances found in reactions such as @xmath10 are expected to have masses larger than about 1.8  gev/@xmath7 , although the higher - mass resonance contributions are expected to be more important in double - meson photoproduction , by sequentially decaying via emission of a @xmath11 or @xmath12 meson and populating intermediate states .",
    "excited baryons are broad and overlapping , making it difficult to extract their properties by studying isolated reaction channels and cross sections alone .",
    "polarization observables can provide access to small resonance contributions to a final state , so that _ missing _ resonances may still be found by studying these in pion photoproduction .",
    "however , both unpolarized cross sections and polarization observables are needed to maximally constrain and uniquely determine the scattering amplitude for a given process .",
    "additional physical constraints are provided by performing an analysis of these observables for multiple reaction channels simultaneously , and to succeed in its description of the contributing resonances , the combined analysis of these data must accurately describe the nonresonant behavior of the observables .",

    "thus further study of the pion photoproduction cross section , particularly at forward angles , is very interesting .",
    "recent measurements of differential cross sections in pion photoproduction have made significant contributions to the world database , but these measurements have limited coverage at very forward center - of - mass polar angles of the pion , @xmath14 . the recent cb - elsa  @xcite and clas data  @xcite on @xmath0 cover angles down to approximately @xmath15 and @xmath16 in @xmath14 , respectively .",

    "a 3.175-gev electron beam was extracted ( by slow resonant extraction ) from elsa .",
    "the electrons were passed through a thin copper radiator , which had a thickness of @xmath30 ( radiation length ) , where a fraction of them underwent bremsstrahlung .",
    "these electrons were deflected by a dipole magnet into the tagger detector system ( tagger ) , which consisted of 480  scintillating fibers above 14  scintillation counters in a partly overlapping configuration .",
    "good knowledge of the magnetic field and the position of the hit in the tagger allowed the momentum and energy of each electron to be determined .",
    "the tagged - photon energy is given by the difference between the incoming electron energy and the electron energy after bremsstrahlung .",
    "electrons that did not undergo bremsstrahlung were deflected at small angles into a beam dump located behind the tagger .",
    "tagged photons had energies ranging from 0.5 to 2.9  gev ; the higher energy part of this bremsstrahlung spectrum had an energy resolution of about 2  mev , while the lower part had an energy resolution of approximately 25  mev .",
    "the energy calibration of the photon tagging system was determined in simulations using the known positions of the scintillating fibers and the measured magnetic field map , and approximated by a polynomial .",
    "measurements with a known ( lower - energy ) elsa beam allowed for a cross - check of the calibration ; this involved guiding a low - current beam directly into the tagger , while holding the magnetic field constant .",
    "corrections to the original polynomial were determined from this procedure .",
    "tagged photons continued along the beam line toward a liquid - hydrogen target , which was 5  cm in length and 3  cm in diameter , located at the center of the crystal barrel ( cb ) calorimeter ( see fig .  [",

    "taps was configured as a hexagonal wall and served as the forward endcap of the cb .",
    "the cb originally covered polar angles down to 12@xmath34 and was made of 26 rings  @xcite .",
    "downstream rings @xmath37 of the cb were removed to allow for a tight fit with taps ( see top of fig .",
    "[ figure : cb - luzy - h2 ] ) .",
    "forward - going protons were detected by plastic scintillators ( 5  mm thick ) located in front of each taps module ; the other protons were detected by a three - layer scintillating fiber detector , which closely surrounded the target  @xcite .",
    "photons that did not interact with the target material continued further along the beam line through a hole in taps and finally arrived at the beam monitor , a total absorption @xmath38erenkov counter , which consisted of an array of nine lead glass crystals .",
    "the number of photons counted here was vital to the determination of the photon flux .",
    "the first - level trigger was provided by the fast response of the taps modules . a cellular logic called fast - cluster encoder ( face ) , which counted the number of clusters in the barrel , formed the second - level trigger .",
    "the trigger required at least one hit in taps above a high - energy threshold ( led - high ) and at least one face cluster , or it required at least two hits in taps in different segments above a low - energy threshold ( led - low ) .",

    "the resolution for proton clusters in the calorimeters is worse than that for photon clusters because , on average , proton clusters are much smaller than photon clusters .",

    "in particular , the new data are rather sensitive to contributions from high - spin resonances located in the mass region @xmath104  mev/@xmath7 . the behavior of the differential cross sections at very extreme angles should be a good indicator for the presence of such states .",
    "the sensitivity of the pwa solution to a particular resonance is studied by omitting or including it in the fits and evaluating the fit quality in terms of the resulting @xmath45  values .",
    "the observation of a clear minimum in a mass scan gives further confidence about a contributing resonance .",
    "in such a scan , the mass of a resonance is chosen in several steps in the vicinity of the optimum value and fixed in the fit . the mass is then plotted versus the change of the @xmath45  value from the best fit .",
    "figure  [ figure : massscan ] shows a typical scan from this analysis .",
    "an overall scaling factor of 14% is needed in the pwa to achieve quantitative consistency of the data with the previous measurements of the cb - elsa collaboration  @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that a similar factor was needed to provide a compatibility between the cb - elsa and clas data  @xcite . in that case , however , the clas data needed to be scaled up by 5% . fitting only such a scale factor",
    ", we obtained a rather good description of the data ( reduced @xmath105 ) for both solutions reported in  @xcite . including the new data in the database and slightly readjusting the parameters",
    ", we obtained an improved value of @xmath106 without notable changes in the description of other photoproduction data .",
    "the highest spin state which was observed in photoproduction reactions is the @xmath107 resonance .",
    "this is a four - star resonance according to the pdg classification , and the behavior of the @xmath8  elastic amplitude in this partial wave clearly shows the presence of a pole in the mass region @xmath108  mev/@xmath7 .",
    "the recent clas data on the reaction @xmath109  @xcite demand a contribution from this state for a good description of the recoil asymmetry data .",
    "thus , we expect to observe this state in the pion photoproduction reactions .",
    "indeed , we found that the coupling of this state into the @xmath8  channel ( which is fixed by the elastic data ) is much stronger than that into the @xmath110  channel , and in the combined analysis of our database , we found a small but not negligible contribution from this state to the pion photoproduction cross section .",
    "the pole position of the @xmath4  state was found to be @xmath111  mev , and the mass scan is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : massscan ] with a solid line .",
    "a minimum , fully compatible with that observed in the clas @xmath109 data is clearly seen .",
    "one of the new states which was observed in the earlier analysis of the pion and @xmath12  photoproduction data  @xcite was a @xmath5  state with a mass of @xmath112  mev/@xmath7 and a width of @xmath113  mev/@xmath7 . in the combined analysis of the present database ,",
    "this state was optimized with a mass of @xmath114  mev/@xmath7 and a width of @xmath115  mev/@xmath7 .",
    "the mass scan of this state for the presented pion photoproduction data is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : massscan ] as a dashed line .",
    "it is seen that the minimum corresponds well to the mass of the state found in the combined analysis , but the data are more tolerant to a lower resonance mass .",
    "for the first observation of the @xmath116  state in the analysis of the @xmath117 differential cross section  @xcite , it was shown that this state can also contribute to the pion photoproduction cross section . in the present analysis ,",
    "the @xmath8  coupling of this state was found to be similar to the @xmath118  coupling .",
    "the mass scan , shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : massscan ] with a dotted line , produced the minimum slightly above the mass value defined by the combined fit .",
    "however , the data can accept well the mass of the state between 2060 and 2120  mev/@xmath7 .",
    "higher - mass @xmath119-wave states can also contribute to photoproduction and were included as multichannel relativistic breit - wigner amplitudes in the pwa  @xcite .",
    "we have performed mass scans of the @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122  states , which were observed in the analysis of the @xmath109 clas data  @xcite .",
    "candidates for these @xmath119-wave states are listed as two - star resonances by the pdg ; a third @xmath123 resonance has been assigned a one - star status  @xcite .",
    "evidence for a higher - mass @xmath124-state around 2000  mev/@xmath7 was also recently reported by the clas collaboration in @xmath125  photoproduction off the proton  @xcite .",
    "however , no minima were observed in our mass scans for the description of the present data .",
    "further single- and double - polarization observables are needed to constrain the scattering amplitude and to extract weakly contributing resonances .    in a final comment",
    ", we note that our description of the data and the current said solution ( sp09 )  @xcite underestimate the most - forward data at all three photon energies presented in fig .",
    "[ figure : selected ] .",
    "the overall systematic error can certainly account for some of the observed discrepancy , but some physics may be missing .",
    "this needs to be further addressed in future analyses .",
    "in summary , we have presented data on the photoproduced @xmath1  cross section in the reaction @xmath0 .",
    "the continuous beam from the elsa accelerator and the fiber detector of the tagging system provided tagged photons in the energy range from 850 to 2500  mev .",
    "the results are in good overall agreement with previous measurements of this reaction but are underestimated by the models at very forward angles for large photon energies .",
    "the bonn - gatchina pwa found the @xmath107 , @xmath126 , and @xmath116 high - mass resonances in its description of the data .",
    "we thank the technical staff at elsa and at all the participating institutions for their invaluable contributions to the success of the experiment .",
    "we acknowledge financial support from the national science foundation ( nsf ) , deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( dfg ) within the sfb / tr16 and from schweizerischer nationalfonds .",
