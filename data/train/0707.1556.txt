    "in the standard model ( minimally extended to include non - zero neutrino mass ) the neutrino magnetic moment is non - zero , but small , and is given by  @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the neutrino mass and @xmath5 is the bohr magneton .",
    "an experimental observation of a magnetic moment larger than that given in eq.([sm ] ) would thus be a clear indication of physics beyond the minimally extended standard model .",
    "current laboratory limits are determined via neutrino - electron scattering at low energies , with @xmath6  @xcite and @xmath7  @xcite obtained from solar and reactor experiments , respectively",
    ". a stronger limit can be obtained from constraints on energy loss from stars , @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "it is possible to write down a simple relationship between the size of the neutrino mass and neutrino magnetic moment .",
    "if a magnetic moment is generated by physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) at an energy scale @xmath9 , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : naive]a , we can generically express its value as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the electric charge and @xmath12 contains a combination of coupling constants and loop factors . removing the photon from the same diagram ( fig .",

    "however , it is well known that the nave restriction given in eq.([naive ] ) can be overcome via a careful choice for the new physics . for example",
    ", we may impose a symmetry to enforce @xmath15 while allowing a non - zero value for @xmath0  @xcite , or employ a spin suppression mechanism to keep @xmath4 small  @xcite .",
    "note though , that these symmetries are typically broken by standard model interactions . by calculating contributions to @xmath4 generated by sm radiative corrections involving the magnetic moment interaction ,",
    "we may thus obtain general , naturalness \" upper limits on the size of neutrino magnetic moments .",
    "one possibility for allowing a large @xmath0 while keeping @xmath4 small is due to voloshin  @xcite .",
    "the original version of this mechanism involved imposing an @xmath16 symmetry , under which the left - handed neutrino and antineutrino ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) transform as a doublet .",
    "the dirac mass term transforms as a triplet under this symmetry and is thus forbidden , while the magnetic moment term is allowed as it transforms as a singlet .",
    "however , the @xmath16 symmetry is violated by sm gauge interactions . for majorana neutrinos",
    ", the voloshin mechanism may be implemented using flavor symmetries , such as those in refs .  .",
    "these flavor symmetries are not broken by sm gauge interactions but are instead violated by sm yukawa interactions .",
    "below , we shall estimate the contribution to @xmath4 generated by sm radiative corrections involving the magnetic moment term .",
    "this allows us to set general , naturalness \" upper limits on the size of neutrino magnetic moments . for dirac neutrinos ,",
    "these limits are several orders of magnitude stronger than present experimental bounds  @xcite .",
    "for majorana neutrinos , however , the bounds are weaker  @xcite .",
    "we assume that the magnetic moment is generated by physics beyond the sm at an energy scale @xmath9 above the electroweak scale . in order to be completely model independent",
    ", the new physics will be left unspecified and we shall work exclusively with dimension @xmath19 operators involving only sm fields , obtained by integrating out the physics above the scale @xmath9 .",
    "we thus consider an effective theory that is valid below the scale @xmath9 , respects the @xmath20 symmetry of the sm , and contains only sm fields charged under these gauge groups .",
    "we start by constructing the most general operators that could give rise to a magnetic moment operator , @xmath21 .",
    "demanding invariance under the sm gauge group , we have the following 6d operators @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the u(1)@xmath25 and su(2)@xmath26 field strength tensors , respectively , and @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the corresponding couplings . the higgs and left - handed lepton doublet fields",
    "are denoted @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively , and @xmath31 .",
    "after spontaneous symmetry breaking , both @xmath32 and @xmath33 contribute to the magnetic moment . through loop diagrams",
    "these operators will generate contributions to the neutrino mass .",
    "for example , the diagram in fig .",
    "[ 4d ] will generate a contribution to the neutrino mass operator , @xmath34 . using dimensional analysis",
    ", we estimate  @xcite @xmath35 and thus @xmath36 if we take @xmath37 1 tev and @xmath38 0.3 ev , we obtain the limit @xmath39 , which is several orders of magnitude stronger than current experimental constraints . given the quadratic dependence upon @xmath9 ,",
    "this constraint becomes extremely stringent for @xmath9 significantly above the electroweak scale .",
    "[ 4d ]    however , if @xmath9 is not significantly larger that the ew scale , higher dimension operators are important , and their contribution to @xmath4 can be calculated in a model independent way . through renormalization , both @xmath32 and @xmath33 will generate a contribution to the 6d neutrino mass operator @xmath40 via the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ 6dfigure ] . solving the renormalization group equations we find that for @xmath41 , @xmath42 in the absence of fine tuning  @xcite .",
    "we have seen above that the `` naturalness '' bounds on the magnetic moments of dirac neutrinos are significantly stronger than present experimental limits .",
    "however , the analogous bounds for majorana neutrinos are much weaker .",
    "the case of majorana neutrinos is more subtle , due to the relative flavor symmetries of @xmath4 and @xmath0 respectively .",
    "majorana neutrinos can not have diagonal magnetic moments , but are permitted non - zero transition moments .",
    "the transition magnetic moment @xmath43_{\\alpha\\beta}$ ] is antisymmetric in the flavor indices @xmath44 , while the mass terms @xmath45_{\\alpha\\beta}$ ] are symmetric .",
    "these different flavor symmetries play an important role in our limits , and are the origin of the difference between the magnetic moment constraints for dirac and majorana neutrinos .    as before ,",
    "we write down the most general set of operators that can give rise to neutrino magnetic moment and mass terms , while respecting the sm gauge group . in the case of majorana neutrinos ,",

    "this allows us to determine constraints on the size of the magnetic moment in terms of the neutrino mass , using eqs.([munu ] ) and ( [ mnu ] ) .",

    "numerically , one has @xmath70 and @xmath71 .    [ summary ]        as the operator @xmath62 is flavor antisymmetric , it must be multiplied by another flavor antisymmetric contribution in order to produce a flavor symmetric mass term .",
    "this can be accomplished through insertion of yukawa couplings in the diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:7d ]  @xcite .",
    "this diagram provides a logarithmically divergent contribution to the 7d mass term , given by  @xcite @xmath72_{\\alpha\\beta } \\simeq \\frac{3 g^2}{16 \\pi^2 } \\frac{m_\\alpha^2 - m_\\beta^2}{v^2 }   \\ln \\frac{\\lambda^2}{m_w^2 } \\left [ c_w^-(\\lambda ) \\right]_{\\alpha\\beta},\\ ] ] where @xmath69 are the charged lepton masses , and the exact coefficient has been computed using dimensional regularization . using this result , together with eqs .",
    "( [ munu ] ) and ( [ mnu ] ) , leads to bound ( i ) in table  [ summary ] .",
    "the neutrino magnetic moment operator @xmath62 will also contribute to the 5d mass operator via two - loop diagrams , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2loop ]  @xcite . as with the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig:7d ] , we require two yukawa insertions in order to obtain a flavor symmetric result . using dimensional analysis , we estimate  @xcite @xmath73_{\\alpha\\beta } \\simeq   \\frac{g^2}{(16 \\pi^2)^2 } \\frac{m_\\alpha^2 - m_\\beta^2}{v^2 }   \\left [   c_w^- ( \\lambda)\\right]_{\\alpha\\beta}. \\label{5d1}\\ ] ] this leads to bound ( ii ) in table  [ summary ] .",
    "compared to 1-loop ( 7d ) case of eq .",
    "( [ eq : owminusone ] ) , the 2-loop ( 5d ) mass contribution is suppressed by a factor of @xmath74 arising from the additional loop , but enhanced by a factor of @xmath75 arising from the lower operator dimension . thus , as we increase the new physics scale , @xmath9 , this two - loop constraint rapidly becomes more restrictive .",
    "the crossover \" scale between the two effects occurs at @xmath76 tev .        if we insert @xmath56 in the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig:7d ] , the contribution vanishes , due to the @xmath77 structure of the graph .",
    "therefore , to obtain a non - zero contribution to @xmath55 from @xmath56 we require the presence of some non - trivial @xmath77 structure .",
    "this can arise , for instance , from a virtual @xmath78 boson loop as in fig .",
    "[ fig : b2m_2loop ]  @xcite .",
    "this mechanism gives the leading contribution of the operator @xmath56 to the 7d mass term .",
    "the @xmath56 and @xmath57 contributions to the 7d mass term are thus related by @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the weak mixing angle and where the factor on the rhs is due to the additional @xmath81 boson loop .",
    "this additional loop suppression for the @xmath56 contribution results in a significantly weaker neutrino magnetic moment constraint than that obtained above for @xmath62 .",
    "the corresponding limit is shown as bound ( iii ) in table  [ summary ] .",
    "however , the leading contribution of @xmath56 to the 5d mass term arises from the same 2-loop diagrams ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2loop ] ) that we discussed in connection with the @xmath62 operator .",
    "therefore , the contribution to the 5d mass term is the same as that for @xmath57 , except for a factor of @xmath82 .",
    "we thus obtain  @xcite @xmath83_{\\alpha\\beta } \\simeq   \\frac{g'^2}{(16 \\pi^2)^2 } \\frac{m_\\alpha^2 - m_\\beta^2}{v^2 }   \\left [ c_b(\\lambda )   \\right]_{\\alpha\\beta}\\ \\ \\ , \\label{5db}\\ ] ] corresponding to bound ( iv ) in table .",
    "[ summary ] .",
    "importantly , this is the strongest constraint on the @xmath56 contribution to the neutrino magnetic moment for any value of @xmath9 , and the most general of our bounds on @xmath84  @xcite .",
    "the best laboratory limit on @xmath0 , obtained from scattering of low energy reactor neutrinos is , @xmath85  @xcite .",
    "note that this limit applies to both @xmath86 and @xmath87 , as the flavor of the scattered neutrino is not detected in the experiment .",
    "taking the neutrino mass to be @xmath88 ev ( as implied by cosmological observations , e.g. ref .  ) , bound ( iv ) in table .",
    "[ summary ] gives @xmath89^{-2 } \\nonumber \\\\ \\mu_{\\mu e }   & \\lesssim & 3 \\times 10^{-7 }   \\left [ \\lambda(\\text{tev } ) \\right]^{-2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for majorana neutrinos",
    "we thus conclude that if @xmath87 is dominant over the other flavor elements , an experimental discovery near the present limits ( e.g. , at @xmath90 ) would imply @xmath91 tev .",
    "however , this would become @xmath92 tev in any model in which all element of @xmath93 have similar size .",
    "we have discussed radiative corrections to the neutrino mass arising from a neutrino magnetic moment coupling . expressing the magnetic moment in terms of effective operators in a model independent fashion required constructing operators containing the @xmath81 and hypercharge gauge bosons , @xmath57 and @xmath56 respectively , rather than working directly with the electromagnetic gauge boson .",
    "we then calculated @xmath0 naturalness bounds arising from the leading order contributions to neutrino mass term , for both dirac and majorana neutrinos . for dirac",
    "neutrinos we found @xmath94 while the most general naturalness bound on the size of the majorana neutrino magnetic moment is @xmath95_{\\alpha\\beta}}{1~{\\rm ev}}\\right ) \\left(\\frac{1\\ { \\rm tev}}{\\lambda}\\right)^2   \\left| \\frac{m_\\tau^2}{m_\\alpha^2 - m_\\beta^2 } \\right| .",
    "\\label{generallimit}\\ ] ] these limits can only be evaded in the presence of fine tuning .",
    "the limit on the the magnetic moments of dirac neutrinos is thus considerably more stringent than for majorana neutrinos .",
    "this is due to the different flavor symmetries involved , since in the majorana case we require the insertion of yukawa couplings to convert a flavor antisymmetric ( magnetic moment ) operator into a flavor symmetric ( mass ) operator .",
    "our results implies that an experimental discovery of a magnetic moment near the present limits would signify ( i ) neutrinos are majorana fermions and ( ii ) new lepton number violating physics responsible for the generation of @xmath0 arises at a scale @xmath9 which is well below the see - saw scale .",
