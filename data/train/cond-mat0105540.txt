    "in recent years gauge theories have become a prominent tool in the description of strongly correlated electron systems @xcite .",
    "the gauge field appears because we attempt to use fermion operators to describe excitations of a strongly correlated state .",
    "we know that the fermion operators are useful at low energies only when the ground state wave function can be described by a slater determinant .",
    "if the ground state is a strongly correlated state , we can not use the fermion / boson operators to write down a free low energy effective theory .",
    "however if we insist on writing everything in terms of fermion / boson operators , one finds that we can use fermion / boson operators to describe the low energy physics of a strongly correlated state provided that gauge fields are introduced .",
    "this is why low energy effective theories of strongly correlated states , such as the quantum hall states and spin liquid states , are all gauge theories .    realizing that the electron operator is not a good starting point to describe a strongly correlated state",
    ", we can rewrite the electron operator as a product of several other operators in order to study those states .",
    "these operators are called parton operators ( the spinon and holon operators are examples of parton operators ) .",
    "we then construct mean - field states in the hilbert space of partons . after identifying the gauge structure",
    " the transformations between partons that leave the electron operator unchanged , we can project the mean - field state onto the physical hilbert space ( _ i.e. _ the gauge invariant space ) and obtain a strongly correlated electron state .",
    "although the parton mean - field state is a slater determinant , the projected state is _ not _ and can be used to describe the correlations in certain strongly correlated states .",
    "this procedure , in its general form , is called projective construction , which is a generalization of the slave - boson approach@xcite .",
    "the generic projective construction and the associated gauge structure was discussed in detail for quantum hall states in @xcite .",
    "the resulting effective theory arising from the projective construction naturally contains a gauge structure . in this paper",
    ", we will use the projective - construction/ slave - boson - approach to study the electron spectral function in underdoped high @xmath0 superconductors .",
    "one convenient way to describe dynamical gauge theories is via the path integral approach . traditionally , however , the formalism which allows for most direct comparison with experimental results is based on green s functions and diagrammatic techniques .",
    "this turns out to be a kind of nuisance since the standard expression for the single particle green s function ( the cornerstone of diagrammatic perturbation theory ) is not gauge invariant .",
    "the lack of gauge invariance makes it hard to extract any meaningful quantitative results based on these green s functions . in the first part of the paper we present a calculation of a particular gauge invariant green s function for 2 + 1 dimensional massless dirac particles coupled to a dynamical gauge field .",
    "the motivation for this analysis arises from an effective continuum description - the algebraic spin liquid ( asl)@xcite , which we believe underlies the strange phenomenology of the normal state of underdoped high temperature superconductors . within this continuum model , which is rooted in the slave - boson approach to strongly correlated systems ,",
    "the spin degrees of freedom are carried by massless dirac particles called spinons .",
    "our early attempt to interpret the resulting spinon propagator as describing the propagation of the physical particle is however thwarted by the appearance of a negative anomalous dimension for the particular gauge invariant spinon amplitude at the asl fixed point . on reinterpreting the proposed amplitude as representing a two - particle spinon - holon propagator , we find that the main effect of the gauge fluctuation is to bind the two particles ( via its effect on the vertex ) to a more coherent entity .",
    "thus we are led to the heuristic description of the physical electron propagator presented in the last section of the paper where in addition to the spinon contribution we include the bosonic holon contribution .",
    "not surprisingly the resulting spectrum has no quasiparticle peak , however it is also not totally incoherent once the gauge fluctuations are included .",
    "the emerging picture for the electron propagation is thus one of spinons and holons ( separate at the mean field level ) whose attractive interaction mediated via the gauge field leads to the formation of a more coherent structure on top of the incoherent mean - field background @xcite . in analyzing this problem we have been guided by a first quantized path integral approach to the physical green s function which makes the gauge dependence of the amplitude particularly transparent .",
    "before plunging into the second quantized formalism let us look at the problem in the light of single particle quantum mechanics .",
    "our starting point is the following definition for a gauge - invariant green s function in first quantized notation @xmath1 + l[a ] ) } e^{-i\\int_\\mid a_{\\mu } dx_{\\mu } } \\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the straight line connecting @xmath3 to @xmath4 , @xmath5 and the metric is euclidean .",

    "( [ polarisation ] ) ] .",
    "the action for the particle moving in an external gauge field can be taken to have the following form @xmath7= \\int_0^{\\vec{x } } d\\tau l[x(\\tau ) ] + \\int_{\\wr } a_{\\mu } dx_{\\mu}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 indicates a path from @xmath3 to @xmath4 described by @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 $ ] remains unspecified since we will be concerned with different types of particles . putting the above together we obtain the following expression for the green s function @xmath11 + l[a ] ) } e^{i\\int_{\\mid}a_{\\mu } dx_{\\mu}-i\\int_{\\wr}a_{\\mu } dx_{\\mu}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this expression exhibits the gauge dependence in a particularly appealing form where the line integrals close up into a contour , of which one side is the propagating path of the particle and other side the straight - line path needed to make the gauge invariance manifest . via stokes theorem",
    "we see that the sum of the line integrals is nothing but the flux going through the contour .",
    "so far our expressions have full rotational symmetry in order to perform the calculation we now chose to parameterize the particle world - lines by their @xmath12 coordinate .",
    "hence @xmath13 goes over to @xmath14 where @xmath15 denote the 2 spatial components of the corresponding 3-vectors . in order to simplify our analysis",
    "further we consider the propagation of the particle only along the time direction i.e. @xmath16 . considering the propagation between equal spatial coordinates",
    "we have no contribution from the 2-velocity component along the straight line path which simplifies this part of the phase factor to @xmath17 .",
    "next we want to perform the average over the gauge fluctuations which is straightforward given the gaussian weight ( [ gaugeaction ] ) .",

    "note particularly that in choosing the @xmath19 gauge we got rid of the remaining contribution of the straight line path to the phase factor in the expression for the green s function .",
    "now we perform the average over the gauge fluctuations @xmath23 the calculation is straightforward albeit some care has to be taken with the boundary conditions . the averaging results in @xmath24^{2 } + ( \\tau-\\tau')^{2 } } - \\frac{1}{{\\bf x}^{2}+(\\tau-\\tau')^2}\\right .",

    "expressions ( [ effectiveinteraction ] ) and ( [ rotationalinvariantinteraction ] ) exhibit nicely the retarded nature of the effective interaction . in principle , to obtain the propagator @xmath28 , we would now have to perform the average over the trajectories with the free particle action appropriate for the particle in question .",
    "for a _ massive _ particle we can neglect the spatial part of the retardation since it is down by a factor of the speed of `` light '' ( the spinon velocity ) which we have set equal to one .",
    "hence we can see that only the term proportional to @xmath29 gives a non - vanishing contribution whose effect is to renormalize the mass of the particle . for a massless relativistic particle however both spatial and temporal retardation",
    "are equally important and the argument above can not be applied .",
    "we find that the integrals in ( [ effectiveinteraction ] ) are all dimensionless . in the large @xmath30 limit ,",
    "those integrals have the form @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the short distance cut - off scale .",
    "the @xmath33 term corresponds to mass generation . within second quantization ,",
    "as we will discuss next , the mass term can not be generated if we regularize our theory at short distances in a way consistent with the underlying lattice symmetries + gauge structure @xcite .",
    "thus we can set the regularization dependent term @xmath33 to zero .",
    "the true leading term has a form @xmath34 ( @xmath35 is regularization independent ) .",
    "those contributions can only change the exponent of the free green s function : @xmath36 .",
    "the effect of the gauge interaction is to modify the exponent in the algebraic decay of the green s function , which means that the gauge interaction is a marginal perturbation .",
    "having used the first quantized version of the path integral to guide our intuition we will henceforth return to field theory and in particular to the problem of massless dirac spinors coupled to a u(1 ) gauge field . the euclidean model which we are concerned with is the following @xmath37 with the dynamics for the gauge field given by @xmath38",

    "there 1,2 denotes two types of fermi points and e , o denote even and odd lattice sites respectively .",
    "notice that we have generalized to n fermion species in order to have a more controlled perturbation theory ( n=2 in the physical case ) .",

    "> from the path integral discussion above we have learned a way to calculate a particular gauge invariant green s function for the fermi fields .",
    "note that a certain choice for the gauge has to be made before we can invert the polarization operator to obtain the gauge propagator . in order",

    "details of this calculation are presented in the appendix .",
    "we find for the self - energy @xmath70    had the self - energy taken the form @xmath71 we could read off the anomalous dimension of the fermion field and found the green s function @xmath72 @xmath73 since the above @xmath74 has no explicit @xmath75 dependence , we find @xmath76    however , the coefficients of the two terms in eq .",
    "( [ sigma_a0 ] ) are not equal and the above calculation of @xmath60 is not valid . but noting that the coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ sigma_a0 ] ) have the same sign - corresponding to a negative @xmath77 - this allows us to conclude that @xmath78 has the form @xmath79 we see that the effect of gauge interactions is to make the propagator decay slower . in the path integral",
    "picture , the gauge interactions bring the particle path closer to the straight - line path so the area enclosed by the two paths is smaller . since the particle path is closer to the straight - line path in the @xmath30 direction , this leads us to believe that the second @xmath80 term in eq .",
    "( [ sigma_a0 ] ) is not important compared to the first @xmath81 term .",
    "hence @xmath82 this gives us @xmath83    we would like to mention that the renormalization program within the temporal axial gauge is not established ( see ref .",

    "( [ galpha ] ) , we follow a different route where we consider in addition to the massless fermions coupled to the gauge field a heavy boson field whose `` current '' will take care of the straight line path in the equal space correlater .",
    "this type of formulation is borrowed from heavy quark effective theory approaches to qcd @xcite .",
    "the task at hand is thus a calculation of the wavefunction renormalization of the boson fermion bilinear @xmath84 with the following lagrangian @xmath85 in order to calculate the wavefunction renormalization of the above composite we need the field strength renormalizations @xmath86 for both the fermion and the boson field as well as the vertex renormalizations @xmath87 .        to obtain the boson wavefunction renormalization we calculate its self energy due to the gauge field fluctuations fig[[selfenergy_boson ] ] . as can be seen from the above lagrangian , the boson being static only couples to the coulomb field .",
    "thus we arrive at the following expression for the boson self energy .",
    "@xmath88 whose divergent part evaluates ( see appendix ) to @xmath89 where the sign convention for the self energy has been chosen in accord with the one for the fermion field mentioned above .",
    "thus we find for the wavefunction renormalization the minimal @xmath90 this result has been obtained in the landau gauge .",
    "the fermion wavefunction renormalization can be obtained similarly from the self energy and reads in the landau gauge @xmath91     flowing along the static boson line , width=113 ]",
    "we now have all the ingredients to calculate the wave function renormalization of the fermion boson bilinear in the minimal form @xmath96 this result is gauge invariant .",
    "from the above discussion we can see that within the axial temporal gauge there is no coulombic interaction and hence both the vertex correction and the boson wavefunction renormalization are absent which would suggest that @xmath97 which yields @xmath82 for the anomalous dimension of the fermion field .",
    "an important point to note here is the fact that the gauge fluctuations do not generate a mass or a chemical - potential term perturbatively . in a diagram calculation",
    ", a regularization dependent mass / chemical - potential term actually appears in the self - energy .",
    "we have set such a regularization dependent mass / chemical - potential term equal to zero . in the next section",
    "we will see that our dirac-@xmath98 gauge system is the low energy effective description of the so called staggered flux ( sf ) phase ( the mean - field phase corresponding to the pseudogap regime within the @xmath99 slave boson theory ) .",
    "the lattice sf phase provides a short distance regularization .",
    "now the question is whether such a regularization generates a regularization dependent mass / chemical - potential term or not .",
    "one way to answer the above question is through a symmetry argument . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is shown that any change of the mean - field sf ansatz can not generate a mass term or chemical potential term if the change does not break any symmetries and does not break the @xmath98 gauge structure .",
    "this implies that if the regularization is consistent with the underlying lattice symmetries and does not break the @xmath98 gauge structure , then the regularization can not generate any mass / chemical - potential terms .",
    "this is the reason why we can set the regularization dependent mass / chemical - potential term equal to zero .",
    "we see that the massless dirac fermion is protected by the lattice symmetries and by the @xmath98 gauge structure ( or more precisely , protected by the quantum order@xcite ) .",
    "thus what we really have learned from the diagram calculation is that the mass or chemical - potential is not generated spontaneously from the infrared divergences ( at the perturbative level ) . combining the symmetry consideration for the high energy cutoff and the diagram calculation for the infrared , we find that no mass or chemical - potential is generated from the self energy corrections to the fermion green s function .",
    "in contrast , the first quantized path integral analysis does not know about the underlying lattice symmetries and , as a result allows for corrections to the mass or chemical - potential due to dressing with the short - distance gauge fluctuations ( see discussion in section [ section2 ] )",
    ". we would like to mention that the dirac-@xmath98 gauge system was studied in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite using a different gauge fixing .",
    "it was shown that the mass / chemical - potential term is not generated perturbatively to all orders in a @xmath57 expansion .",
    "furthermore note that since the conserved current ( that couples to @xmath100 ) can not have any anomalous dimension , the gauge interaction is an _ exact _ marginal perturbation .",
    "hence we can take the anomalous dimension seriously and obtain the full green s function in the form @xmath101 where @xmath102 is determined by the energy range over which the effective theory is supposed to be valid . comparing this dressed propagator with the free fermion green s function @xmath64",
    "we see that the inclusion of the gauge fluctuations has destroyed the coherent quasiparticle pole .    at this point a couple of comments",
    "are in order .",
    "so far we have not addressed the fact that the sign of the anomalous dimension ( leading to a slower decay of the single particle propagator in real space ) is highly counter intuitive .",
    "fermion - fermion interaction is _ normally _ expected to result in a suppression of the single particle propagator - not an enhancement .",
    "this fact combined with wishful thinking has led to the qed3 picture of the single particle spectrum proposed in ref .",
    "this paper initiated a debate about the true value and sign of the gauge invariant anomalous dimension in massless qed3 which is ongoing @xcite .",
    "the resolution of the question of the * right * gauge invariant `` dressed charge '' propagator ( as khveshchenko puts it @xcite ) is an interesting and important question for qed3 and beyond the scope of the current analysis .",
    "however , what we must conclude from the above stated calculation is the fact that the gauge invariant object which was studied here - a massless dirac fermion coupled to an infinitely heavy particle ( the straight - line path above ) at the asl fixed point has a negative anomalous dimension . in hindsight",
    "this can be understood as a sign of confinement - the effect of the gauge fluctuations is the tendency to form a bound state between the two particles .",
    "this picture of confinement is one of central importance to the question of spin charge separation .    in the following",
    "we will outline a calculation of the electron spectral function which is more directly rooted in the su(2 ) approach of wen and lee @xcite . here",
    "we include the effect of the gauge fluctuations - the confining tendency , gleaned from the above analysis - more heuristically .",
    "it was mentioned above that the problem of massless dirac particles coupled to a gauge field is intimately related to a possible model description of the copper oxide planes in the high @xmath103 superconductors @xcite . to keep the discussion reasonably self - contained",
    "we will first relate some of the details of the mean field flux state as it appears in the su(2 ) slave boson formulation @xcite .",
    "the slave boson theories approach the copper oxide problem from the insulating side ; restricting the single particle hilbert space on each copper site to three states with the doubly occupied one prohibited via the use of a lagrangian multiplier field . within a path integral implementation of the above mentioned constraint it is the lagrange multiplier that gets promoted to the temporal component of a gauge field .",
    "the starting point for the investigation is the t - j hamiltonian which is believed to contain the essential physics and exhibits nicely the competition of kinetic versus local spin fluctuations . within the su(2 )",
    "formulation the physical electron operator is represented as follows : @xmath104 where the following su(2 ) doublets were introduced @xmath105 the @xmath106 are the two fermion fields representing the destruction of a spin up and spin down on site i respectively and @xmath107 is the doublet of bosonic fields keeping track of the doped holes .",
    "the procedure is now to put this representation into the t - j hamiltonian @xmath108p\\ ] ] which on performing a hubbard - stratonovich transformation to the appropriate bosonic bond variables yields the following partition function @xmath109 + \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i , j,\\sigma}\\psi^{\\dag}_{\\sigma i}(\\partial_{\\tau}\\delta_{ij}+\\tilde{j}u_{ij})\\psi_{\\sigma j } \\nonumber \\\\   & + & \\sum_{il}a^{l}_{0i}\\big(\\frac{1}{2}\\psi^{\\dag}_{\\sigma i}\\tau^{l}\\psi_{\\sigma i } + h^{\\dag}_{i}\\tau^{l}h_{i}\\big ) \\nonumber \\\\   & + & \\sum_{ij}h^{\\dag}_{i}\\big((\\partial_{\\tau}-\\mu)\\delta_{ij}+\\tilde{t}u_{ij}\\big)h_{j}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the @xmath110 fluctuations incorporate the projection to the space of su(2 ) singlets .",
    "furthermore note that @xmath111 @xcite and the matrix @xmath112 in the form @xmath113 contains the hubbard - stratonovich fields which classify the part of the phase diagram we are looking at .",
    "the mean - field phase diagram ( see introduction ) is found by minimizing the free energy for a given number of particles with respect to the bond variables @xmath112 .",
    "the phase which will be of interest to us is the so called staggered flux ( sf)phase which can be represented as @xmath114 the slave boson representation results in the following expression for the physical electron green s function @xmath115 in the sf state we do nt have any anomalous fermion - fermion pairing ( both @xmath116 and @xmath93 are diagonal in isospin space ) and hence this simplifies to @xmath117 the angle brackets @xmath118 mean averaging with respect to the partition function ( [ su2_partition ] ) .",
    "the complication with this task however is the presence of light bosons whose tendency to condense prohibits sensible perturbation theory .",
    "our strategy here will be to first calculate the following mean field decomposition @xmath119 and then incorporate the confining effect of the gauge field by making the algebraic decay of the spinon green s function in real space slower .",
    "the motivation for this is rooted in the result of the previous section ( the negative anomalous dimension for the spinon amplitude at the asl fixed point ) and we will discuss the implied approximations down below . with the help of    @xmath120    we can express the fourier transform of @xmath121 in the form @xmath122 to make contact with our previous discussions",
