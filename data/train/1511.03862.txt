    "it is common knowledge that nuclei are well described by the `` atomic - like picture '' in which nucleons are considered as the independent particles moving in a mean potential , and the shell model based on this picture has achieved great success . on the other hand ,",
    "the `` molecular - like picture '' can also be one of important aspects of nuclei .",
    "it is the basic concept of the cluster model in which nucleons are regarded as the strongly correlated particles forming clusters , for example @xmath0 particle , and then the clusters in nuclei weakly interact with each other . theoretically , the cluster structure is predicted , for instance in refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein , to appear at the surface of not only light stable nuclei but also sd - shell or unstable nuclei .",
    "at this moment , however , there is no direct evidence from experimental studies of the nuclear cluster phenomena except for the decay width of the resonance states .",
    "so far , a large number of measurements of @xmath0-transfer reactions such as ( @xmath3li ,  @xmath4 ) , ( @xmath7li ,  @xmath8 ) and their inverses have been done in order to verify the existence of @xmath0-cluster structure .",
    "for example , the @xmath0-cluster structure ( @xmath9o ) of the @xmath1ne nucleus was experimentally studied from the @xmath0-transfer reaction @xmath2o(@xmath3li ,  @xmath4)@xmath1ne  @xcite and its inverse reaction @xmath1ne(@xmath4 ,  @xmath3li)@xmath2o  @xcite at several incident energies @xmath10 . in their works , the @xmath0-cluster structure of @xmath1ne at the @xmath11th excited state",
    "is discussed by using the normalization factor @xmath12 in the form of the ratio @xmath13 .",
    "the factor @xmath12 is the phenomenologically adjusted normalization one conventionally called a `` spectroscopic factor ( sf ) '' in calculations with reaction models , though it is not necessarily the physical sf . here",
    "@xmath14 stands for the ground state .",
    "the reason why the relative value was used is that the absolute one is not able to be determined from the analyses with the conventional distorted - wave born approximation ( dwba ) calculation , some of which bring a normalization factor highly exceeding unity on the calculated cross section .",
    "this unphysical normalization , which strongly depends on @xmath10 , is mainly due to the ambiguities of , in the dwba analyses  @xcite , the optical potential of @xmath3li and the @xmath0-@xmath2o relative wave function .",
    "the @xmath3li optical potentials used in the dwba analyses are not global ones , which have inconsistent parameter sets depending on both @xmath10 and target nuclei .",
    "it is necessary to work with a global frame work regarding the optical potential in order to systematically investigate the @xmath0-cluster structure .    in view of this situation , we set our goal to extract the information of spatial distribution , surface distribution in particular , of @xmath0-clusters from observables . for this purpose",
    ", it is important to clarify how @xmath0-cluster structure is probed by the reaction . because the so - called sf is the inclusive quantity defined as a norm of a cluster wave function , it is not suitable to discuss the development of the cluster at the surface .",
    "indeed , the sf can reach unity even if there is no spatial development of clusters because wave functions of the lowest allowed states of the su(3 ) shell model are equivalent to that of the cluster model wave functions as stated by bayman and bohr  @xcite .",
    "it means that the sf can not be appropriate to discuss the clustering phenomena",
    ". therefore direct comparison of calculated cross sections with measured ones is important , and it is necessary to construct a numerically reliable theoretical framework .    in this paper , we analyze the @xmath0-transfer reaction @xmath2o(@xmath3li ,  @xmath4)@xmath1ne in order to probe the surface distribution of the @xmath0-cluster structure of @xmath1ne in its ground state by means of the coupled - channels born approximation ( ccba )  @xcite .",
    "the ccba framework is able to avoid the aforementioned ambiguity of the @xmath15li optical potential by considering the three - body ( @xmath5o ) model , in which the breakup effect of @xmath15li into @xmath0 and @xmath4 is explicitly taken into account employing the method of the continuum - discretized coupled - channels ( cdcc )  @xcite .",
    "as the cluster model for the calculation of the @xmath0-@xmath2o wave function , we adopt the microscopic cluster model ( mcm ) with the generator coordinate method ( gcm )  @xcite , which gives the consistent properties of @xmath1ne with experimental ones . employing the mcm , in our framework , it does not matter the aforementioned ambiguity of the @xmath0-@xmath2o wave function . through the ccba approach with the mcm",
    ", we show a significant improvement of the theoretical result to be consistent with experimental data .",
    "then , in order to clarify which region of the cluster wave function is probed on the cross section , we analyze the dependence of the cross section on the cluster wave function using the conventional potential model ( pm ) , in which a phenomenological two - body potential is assumed as the interaction between the clusters .",

    ", @xmath145 expresses the breakup transfer ( bt ) , in which the @xmath0 particle transfers from the dc states to the ground state of @xmath1ne . in fig .",
    "[ fig6](c ) we show the intuitive picture of these processes .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] shows the results of the ccba calculation with @xmath22 ( solid line ) , @xmath144 ( dashed line ) , and @xmath145 ( dotted line ) at ( a ) @xmath117 and ( b ) 42.1  mev . the mcm wave function is employed for these results .",
    "the dash - dotted line corresponds to the et without the bc , that is , the one - step calculation . at each incident energy , the solid and dashed lines coincide with each other in the whole region of @xmath115 , while the dash - dotted line deviates from them .",
    "this indicates that the breakup effect of @xmath3li , the bc effect in particular , is significantly important .",
    "in contrast to that , the contribution of the bt is negligibly small .",
    "these features were reported  @xcite also for the @xmath3li - induced subbarrier @xmath0-transfer reaction  @xcite .",
    "this can intuitively be understood to be due to the hindrance of the bt by the @xmath0-@xmath4 coulomb interaction  @xcite .",
    "it should also be noted that the importance of this breakup effect does not mean the failure of the dwba because the bc is effectively taken into account as an `` absorption '' due to the imaginary part of the @xmath3li optical potential . in general , however , the optical potential is phenomenologically determined , and it is difficult to properly evaluate the breakup effect in such a way .",
    "therefore the ccba calculation should be performed to systematically investigate the @xmath0-cluster structure through @xmath3li - induced @xmath0-transfer reactions .",
    "next we discuss the fr effect of the @xmath0-@xmath4 system of @xmath3li . under the zr approximation",

    "[ fig7](a ) , the two results show a good agreement in the diffraction pattern for @xmath149 , although a slight difference in the absolute values is found . on the other hand , at 42.1  mev ( fig .",
    "[ fig7](b ) ) , the two are in out of phase at whole angles . at lower energies ,",
    "the wave length of each scattering wave involved becomes longer , which may justify in assuming the interaction range between @xmath0 and @xmath4 to be sufficiently small compared with the wave length .",
    "the failure of the zr calculation at 42.1  mev has already been reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , it is pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that at @xmath117  mev , the ratio of the spectroscopic strength of the ground state of @xmath1ne to its first excited state , which is extracted from the zr calculation , is different by a factor of two from that evaluated with the fr approach .",
    "this seems to be inconsistent with the result shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7](a ) . therefore , as a future work",
    ", we must understand the fr effect and the breakup effect more deeply through a systematic calculation .",
    "so far , it was partially clarified  @xcite for ( @xmath4 ,  @xmath101 ) reactions that , in general , the fr effect increases the cross section for the et , while decreases that for the bt .",
    "furthermore , it can be said that , although the zr calculation can work well at @xmath117  mev , the fr calculation is necessary for a systematical analysis of the transfer reactions in order to elucidate the clustering phenomena .",
    "in order to make clear the spatial development of the @xmath0-cluster structure of @xmath1ne from observables , we have analyzed the @xmath0-transfer reaction @xmath2o(@xmath3li ,  @xmath4)@xmath1ne at 20.0 and 42.1  mev by means of the ccba approach based on the three - body model . in the ccba model",
    "the total wave function of the system in the initial channel has been described by the cdcc .",
    "this model enables us to use the optical potentials of the subsystems @xmath0- , and @xmath4-@xmath2o , instead of that of @xmath15li which involves a large ambiguity . as for the calculation of the relative wave function between the @xmath0-@xmath2o clusters , the mcm with the gcm",
    "is adopted .",
    "it is a great advantage of our procedure to conventional approach in which the dwba calculation is performed with the @xmath15li optical potential and a phenomenological pm for the @xmath0-@xmath2o wave function .",
    "we have shown that our framework greatly improves the coincidence of the theoretical result with the experimental data on the angular distribution of the transfer cross section .",
    "furthermore , we have obtained the physical value of @xmath85 , of which unphysical values were reported in the previous dwba work  @xcite .",
    "these improvements of the result have been brought by that we adopt the three - body ccba model with the reliable mcm wave function .",
    "next , the pm wave function has been employed in order to reveal which region of the @xmath0-@xmath2o wave function is probed on the transfer cross section . through the comparison of the calculated cross section and the behavior of the pm wave function , it has been concluded that the surface region of the wave function is probed on the cross section ; the region @xmath150  and  5  fm has been found to be sensitive to the reaction at @xmath151 and 20.0  mev , respectively .",
    "we have also clarified the physical meaning of the normalization factor . as a consequence , it has been found that dwba analyses employing a pm can bring the normalization factor involving an unphysical component originated from the improper distribution of the @xmath0-@xmath2o wave function , even if it has a correct asymptotic behavior .",
    "only when we have a reliable wave function , the normalization is equivalent to the sf . as a future work , in order to judge which @xmath142 is proper , it is demanded to systematically analyze the reaction at several incident energies .",
    "the present work can provide useful knowledge for the verification of the cluster structure in sd - shell or unstable nuclei .",
    "we have investigated in detail two kinds of the reaction mechanisms characterized by the @xmath0-@xmath4 system in @xmath3li .",
    "one is the breakup effect and the other is the fr effect .",
    "the former has been found to play an important role as the bc .",
    "since it is difficult to properly include the bc effect in the imaginary part of the @xmath3li optical potential used in a conventional dwba , we need to carry out the three - body ccba calculation for the systematic investigation of the @xmath0-cluster structure through @xmath0-transfer reaction . as for the latter ,",
    "we have shown that the zr approximation works well at @xmath152  mev but does not at 42.1  mev ; the fr calculation is necessary for the systematic analysis of the @xmath0-transfer reaction .",
