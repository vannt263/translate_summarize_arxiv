    "in the field population , the warmest brown dwarfs and the lowest mass stars are in many ways quite different .",
    "beyond the fact that brown dwarfs by definition do not sustain internal energy generation through hydrogen fusion , while very low - mass stars do , the effective temperatures of these two classes of objects span a range of @xmath91500  k and more than an order of magnitude in luminosity .",
    "however , they share one important attribute , which is the presence of dust clouds in their atmospheres . below effective temperatures of @xmath92800  k ,",
    "photospheres are cool enough for particulate matter to form , and this dust persists for objects as cool as @xmath91300  k ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , at which temperature the dust begins to settle below the photosphere .",
    "thus , the formation and sedimentation of dust clouds are among the key processes driving the atmospheric physics of objects in this temperature range , which also includes the warmest extrasolar planets such as transiting hot jupiters and young giant planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to providing excellent laboratories for ultracool atmospheric physics , very low - mass stars and brown dwarfs are also intrinsically interesting as the lowest mass products of star formation .",
    "in particular , the properties of binary systems spanning a wide range of stellar masses can provide discriminating tests of various star formation models .",
    "while the binary properties of low - mass stars ( fgkm spectral types ) have been extensively studied , such studies have only become possible within the past decade for brown dwarfs and stars at the bottom of the main sequence .",
    "in fact , such studies are generally hampered by the fact that brown dwarfs follow a mass  luminosity  age relation , rather than the simpler mass  luminosity relation for main - sequence stars .",
    "for example , a late - m field dwarf may be a young brown dwarf or a star at the bottom of the main sequence .",
    "binaries with well determined orbits are extremely valuable as they break this mass  age degeneracy by providing dynamical mass estimates , though very few mass determinations are available to date ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , mass measurements from binaries typically offer much stronger constraints on substellar models than other commonly measured parameters ( e.g. , age and compositon ) given that their higher precision , hence the concept of using binaries as `` mass benchmarks '' @xcite .",
    "in addition , binary orbits provide a wealth of other information such as the true ( not projected ) semimajor axis and the eccentricity , both of which have different predicted distributions under different formation scenarios ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "one particularly striking result of the many surveys that have searched for brown dwarf binaries is the paucity of intermediate mass ratio binaries .",
    "although such surveys have typically been sensitive to mass ratios as small as @xmath10  0.6 , the mass ratio distribution drops sharply below unity , with @xmath11  50% of binaries having estimated mass ratios of @xmath11  0.9 @xcite .",
    "this is in stark contrast to solar - type binaries whose mass ratio distribution peaks at @xmath90.4 , suggesting a different formation process for these two classes of objects .",
    "although very unequal mass ( or spectral type ) brown dwarf binaries are rare , they provide the strongest coevality tests of substellar theoretical models because they offer the most leverage on constraining model isochrones .",
    "@xcite discovered a faint companion to using the curvature ao system hokupaa at gemini - north , revealing one of the most unequal - flux ultracool binaries known ( @xmath12  =  2.77@xmath80.10  mag ) .",

    "this is the first mass measurement for a binary containing an l / t transition brown dwarf , and we use the direct mass measurement along with the measured luminosities of both components to test evolutionary and atmospheric models in this temperature regime ( @xmath91400  k ) for the first time .",
    "we retrieved _ hst _  archival images of  obtained with the wfpc2 planetary camera ( pc1 ) on ut 1997 april 12 ( go-6345 , pi kirkpatrick ) .",
    "the data comprise four f814w images with exposure times of 2  s , 1000  s , 1000  s , and 300  s , taken in that order in a single orbit .",
    "the companion  is only seen in the latter three images , and the primary star  is saturated in all but the first image .",
    "we used tinytim @xcite to generate point - spread - function ( psf ) models which were fit to the data in a similar fashion to our previous work @xcite , thus allowing us to determine the positions and fluxes of  in each image .",
    "saturated pixels were masked in our psf - fitting routine .",
    "the f814w flux ratio of the binary ( 4.18@xmath80.08  mag ) was determined by comparing the mean peak flux ( i.e. , the model psf s normalization constant ) of  in the latter three images to the peak flux of  in the first image .",
    "since positional information is carried almost entirely in the core of the psf , especially for these undersampled wfpc2 images , we could not determine precise positions for  in the three images in which its core was saturated .",
    "therefore , in order to measure the binary separaton and p.a . , we had to somehow tie the latter three measurements of  to the first shallow image of .",
    "this was accomplished by fitting a first - order polynomial to the positions of , in order to account for any telescope drift that occurred during the observations , and extrapolating this fit to the unsaturated image of .",
    "we found a drift in the @xmath14 position of  of ( 0.82@xmath80.03 , 0.26@xmath80.01 )  pix / hr over the 0.7  hr duration of the observations . after correcting for this drift and using a pixel scale of 45.54@xmath80.01",
    "mas / pix , we found a separation of 274@xmath84  mas , and a position angle ( p.a . ) of 87.3@xmath80.8(table  [ tbl : astrom ] ) .    to determine the uncertainties of our position and flux measurements we simulated the data using images of single stars , allowing us to assess systematic errors in our fitting procedure .",
    "we built a library of single stars from other programs that targeted brown dwarfs with _",
    "( go-8563 , pi kirkpatrick ; go-8581 , pi reid ; and go-8146 , pi reid ) .",
    "we only used stars that had equivalent or higher signal - to - noise ( s / n ) than the science data so that we could degrade the s / n of the library images to match the science data .",
    "we also restricted ourselves to observations consisting of two or more images to allow robust rejection of cosmic rays .",
    "this library served to simulate the unsaturated images of  and .",
    "to simulate the saturated images of  we used other targets from the same program that had also been intentionally saturated to search for faint companions .",
    "we used the five targets closest in apparent flux to  ( lhs  2924 , bri  0021 - 0214 , tvlm  513 - 46546 , lp  412 - 31 , and lhs  2243 ) , which were @xmath15  30% different in flux as measured by our psf - fitting routine .",
    "we did not scale these images to match s flux since it is impossible to scale the saturated pixels .",
    "we added images of single stars from our library to these saturated images after scaling them down and adding poisson noise to match the s / n of .",
    "we shifted these images by an integer number of pixels that best reproduced the observed separation of ( @xmath164.1 , @xmath164.4 ) pixels . by applying our psf - fitting routine to these images",
    ", we were able to assess the position and flux measurements of a faint companion made in the presence of a saturated primary .    from these monte carlo simulations , we derived root - mean - square ( rms ) errors in measured @xmath14 positions of ( 0.05 , 0.06 )  pix and ( 0.07 , 0.07 )  pix for the 300  s and 1000  s images , respectively , with no significant systematic offsets . for the fluxes , the ratio of the input to best - fit value was 1.05@xmath80.05 for the 300  s image and 1.07@xmath80.11 for the 1000  s images .",
    "in addition , we were able to assess the intrinsic uncertainty in our tinytim psf - fitting routine ( i.e. , the error when _ not _ in the presence of a saturated star ) by comparing each undithered pair of psf library images taken in the same orbit .",
    "from this ensemble of single - star position and flux measurements we found that the scatter in both @xmath17 and @xmath18 position measurements was 0.03  pix , and the scatter in peak flux was a factor of 0.06 .",
    "we adopt these errors for the position and flux of measured in the 2  s image , and we adopt the errors from the monte carlo for the positions and fluxes of  measured in the longer , saturated - primary exposures .",
    "this results in a separation uncertainty of 0.08  pix ( 4  mas ) , a p.a . uncertainty of 0.8 , and a flux ratio uncertainty of 0.08  mag .",
    "the drift correction we derived is thus quite significant compared to our derived positional uncertainties .",

    "[ sec : orbit ] , the orbit determination results in an almost identical dynamical mass if this single _ hst _  epoch is excluded .",

    "we used the facility near - infrared camera nirc2 in its narrow field - of - view mode because this provides the finest pixel scale . at each epoch , we obtained data in one or more filters covering the standard atmospheric windows from the mauna kea observatories ( mko ) filter consortium @xcite .",
    "we also obtained data with the @xmath19 filter , positioned shortward of a methane absorption band ( @xmath20  =  1.592  , @xmath21  =  0.126  ) , to enable more robust photometric discrimination in the spectral type estimate of .",
    "the lgs provided the wavefront reference source for ao correction , with the exception of tip - tilt motion .",

    "the tip - tilt correction and quasi - static changes in the image of the lgs as seen by the wavefront sensor were measured contemporaneously by a second , lower bandwidth wavefront sensor monitoring , which saw the equivalent of a @xmath23  @xmath9  15.716.2  mag star .    on each observing run , we obtained dithered images , offsetting the telescope by a few arcseconds between every 25 images .",
    "the sodium laser guide star was positioned at the center of the nirc2 field - of - view for all observations .",
    "the images were reduced in a standard fashion .",

    "note that the closure phases are a linear function of contrast for contrast ratios larger than @xmath325:1 , so for example if the companion were twice as bright , then all the measured and model closure phases would be doubled .",
    "the closure phase uncertainties were initially approximated by the standard error of the mean calculated from the scatter among individual exposures .",
    "the uncertainties were subsequently increased by adding a calibration error in quadrature so that the resulting reduced @xmath33 of the fit was 1.0 .",
