    "the standard scenario of formation of elliptical galaxies is an initial starburst in dissipative gas collapse at very high redshift , followed by passive luminosity evolution to the present ( larson 1974 ; tinsley & gunn 1976 ) . a galaxy evolution model of stellar population synthesis based on such a scenario well reproduces the present spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of elliptical galaxies and naturally explains their color  magnitude relation owing to the galactic wind which stops the starburst ( arimoto & yoshii 1987 ; matteucci & tornamb 1987 ) . an obvious consequence of the standard scenario is that the comoving number density of elliptical galaxies does not change at redshifts of @xmath1 .",
    "however , kauffmann , charlot , and white ( 1996 , hereafter kcw ) recently performed a @xmath0test ( schmidt 1968 ) for a sample of ellipticals in the canada - france redshift survey ( cfrs , lilly et al .",
    "1995a ) , and reported a striking result that their number density should significantly decrease towards @xmath8 .",
    "such a number evolution of field ellipticals obviously contradicts with the standard scenario and might be explained alternatively by mergers of smaller stellar systems and/or gaseous disks ( toomre & toomre 1972 ; kauffmann , white , & guiderdoni 1993 ; baugh , cole , & frenk 1996 ) .    in kcw",
    "s analysis , elliptical galaxies are selected from the cfrs sample if their observed @xmath5 colors are redder than a color boundary which separates ellipticals from other morphological types in the @xmath9 diagram .",
    "they placed the boundary using a bruzual  charlot model of population synthesis with 0.1 gyr single starburst and 50 % solar metallicity .",
    "this boundary certainly gives a reasonable fraction of ellipticals which agrees with _ local _ galaxy surveys .",
    "however , the choice of burst duration and metallicity is only _ ad hoc _ without any physical basis , therefore rendering some doubts as to whether the kcw s color boundary works successfully up to @xmath8 .",
    "on the other hand , local galaxies are known to have different colors from earlier to later types along the hubble sequence , and this color difference is attributed to type - dependent variation of star formation history in galaxies ( tinsley 1980 ; kennicutt , tamblyn , & congdon 1994 ) . therefore , the evolution models which reproduce the present colors would give a more natural way to distinguish various types in the @xmath9 diagram . in this letter , using the type - dependent evolution models of galaxies developed by arimoto & yoshii ( 1987 , hereafter ay ) and arimoto , yoshii , & takahara ( 1992 , hereafter ayt ) , we perform a @xmath0test for the whole cfrs sample consisting of various types as a mixture .",
    "figure [ fig : color - z ] shows the observed @xmath10 colors versus secure redshifts of 591 galaxies in the cfrs sample . also shown are the color trajectories based on the ay ( 10@xmath11 ) model for e / s0 ( solid line ) and the ayt ( i1 ) models for sab ( short - dashed ) , sbc ( long - dashed ) , scd ( dot - short - dashed ) , and sdm ( dot - long - dashed ) . here",
    ", the symbol i1 for spirals stands for the infall model with @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a power index of the schmidt law ( see ayt for details ) . for comparison , kcw s model used as the color boundary between e / s0 and other types",
    "is shown by the dotted line in this figure .    unless otherwise stated , we use the @xmath14-dominated universe with @xmath15 , motivated by the fact that the luminosity density evolution based on the ay and ayt models is consistent with the cfrs data only in this universe ( totani , yoshii , & sato 1997 , hereafter tys ) .",
    "for the redshift of galaxy formation we adopt @xmath16 , because the i1 models with this value of @xmath17 well reproduce madau et al.s ( 1996 , 1997 ) observation of the uv luminosity density at @xmath18 , as shown by tys and totani ( 1997 ) .",
    "furthermore , as far as @xmath19 , the effect of changing @xmath17 is very small in interpreting the cfrs data which extend only to @xmath20 .",
    "we see from fig.1 that the color trajectories well cover the distribution of the cfrs data , and this indicates an overall validity of the e / s0sdm models used here . in order to incorporate the effect of luminosity evolution in the @xmath0test , we associate each of the 591 galaxies in the cfrs sample with a luminosity evolution obtained by interpolating between adjacent two of the five e / s0sdm models which have the nearest @xmath10 color to a sample .",
    "we simply assign the e / s0 or sdm model to red or blue galaxies , respectively , which locate outside the region enclosed by the e / s0 and sdm color trajectories .",
    "for a galaxy of apparent magnitude @xmath21 and redshift @xmath22 in the sample , we define two volumes as @xmath23 where the comoving volume element @xmath24 is a function of @xmath22 which depends on the cosmological parameters of @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 . here , @xmath28 or @xmath29 is the redshift at which the galaxy in question having the absolute magnitude @xmath30",
    "would be observed at the bright ( @xmath31 ) or faint ( @xmath32 ) magnitude limit , respectively .",
    "the cfrs is limited in apparent magnitude between @xmath33 and @xmath34 in the @xmath35 band .",
    "the redshift @xmath36 for either @xmath37=`min ' or @xmath37=`max ' should satisfy the following equation : @xmath38 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 without suffix are those of observed quantities , and @xmath39 is the luminosity distance .",
    "the @xmath40-correction @xmath40 and evolutionary correction @xmath41 are calculated using the ay and ayt models for the galaxy type assigned in  2 .",
    "although the cfrs extends to @xmath42 , we have to limit the redshift range , @xmath43 , over which the determination of redshifts should be free from biases .",
    "following lilly et al .",
    "( 1995b ) , we here adopt ( @xmath44 ) = ( 0.3 , 1 ) and calculate the ratio @xmath0for the cfrs galaxies in this redshift range . in practice ,",
    "if the hypothesis of mild evolution of galaxies is correct , their values of @xmath0are expected to distribute uniformly between 0 and 1 with the average of @xmath0equal to 0.5 , i.e. , @xmath2=0.5 , irrespective of thier type .",
    "our @xmath0statistics give @xmath2=0.405 ( e / s0 ) , 0.396 ( sab ) , 0.507 ( sbc ) , 0.561 ( scd ) , and 0.642 ( sdm ) with their 1 @xmath45 statistical error of 0.030 .",
    "a clear trend of increasing @xmath2from earlier to later types is seen , as claimed by lilly et al ( 1995b ) from their @xmath0test without considering the effect of galaxy evolution .",
    "the significantly small values of @xmath2below 0.5 for e / s0 and sab also seem to be consistent with kcw s result .",
    "we here note that all the cfrs galaxies have been divided into five different types of roughly equal numbers according to their @xmath10 colors .",
    "our type mixture slightly differs from local surveys , but this difference hardly changes the result throughout this paper .    since the @xmath0test is known to give a biased result unless the sample is complete ( schmidt 1968 ; avni & bahcall 1980 ) , we should be careful in interpreting the cfrs data because of difficulties of redshift identification for early type galaxies at @xmath46 .",
    "the spectral range used for the cfrs covers 42508500  , and there are basically no features which are useful for redshift identification below 3727  at rest for emission - line galaxies and 4000  at rest for absorption - line galaxies .",
    "consequently , the redshift identification is difficult at @xmath46 , especially for early type galaxies which show the absorption lines only ( hammer et al .",
    "1995 ; crampton et al .",
    "we clearly see from fig .",
    "[ fig : color - z ] that the red , early type galaxies are unnaturally sparse at @xmath47 , while bluer galaxies extend beyond @xmath8 . it is therefore important to examine how the @xmath0test is affected by changing @xmath48 in the analysis .",
    "figure [ fig : vvmax - z_u ] shows @xmath2as a function of @xmath48 for five different types . a steady decline of @xmath2with increasing @xmath48",
    "is seen beyond @xmath49 for early type galaxies due solely to their paucity in the range of @xmath47 .",
    "in fact , the cfrs group has also pointed out that the apparent absence of red quiescent objects beyond @xmath50 is likely due to selection effects ( see  7 of hammer et al .",
    "1997 ) , which is very well consistent with our results .",
    "therefore we have to decrease @xmath48 down to 0.8 in the case of performing the @xmath0test free from the selection bias . in low redshifts of @xmath51 , on the other hand , the decrease of the ccd efficiency also makes it difficult to indentify red absorption galaxies ( hammer et al .",
    "1995 ; crampton et al .",
    "we have performed analysis varing @xmath52 , and found that changing @xmath52 leads no appreciable effect on @xmath2 .",
    "therefore we use the fixed value of @xmath53 throughout .    our @xmath0statistics with @xmath54 give @xmath2=0.478 ( e / s0 ) , 0.496 ( sab ) , 0.518 ( sbc ) , 0.513 ( scd ) , and 0.583 ( sdm ) with their 1@xmath45 statistical error of 0.035 . these @xmath2values except for sdm are consistent with 0.5 within the statistical uncertainties . in order to see the reason why the @xmath2for sdm is significantly larger than 0.5",
    ", we show the cfrs galaxies classified as sdm in fig . [",
    "fig : ebg ] , where @xmath0is plotted against @xmath55 $ ] .",
    "this figure indicates that much bluer galaxies compared to the sdm model have larger @xmath0 , while galaxies which have the color nearly equal to the sdm model have a relatively uniform distribution in @xmath0 .",
    "apparently the large @xmath2for sdm is originated from such extremely blue galaxies ( ebgs ) with @xmath56 as shown by the encircled points in figs .",
    "[ fig : color - z ] and [ fig : ebg ] .",
    "the number of ebgs is 43 in the redshift range of @xmath57 , and constitutes about 10 % of the 591 galaxies in the whole cfrs sample .",
    "when the ebgs are removed , @xmath2decreases from 0.583 to 0.547 for sdm .",
    "the @xmath2values still seem to increase from earlier to later types , and this might reflect a type transformation which is not included in our hypothesis of mild evolution .",
    "however , we avoid any decisive conclusion about this possibility of type transformation , because the @xmath2values for all the types except for ebgs are consistent with 0.5 within the statistical uncertainties .",
    "thereby we conclude that the hypothesis of mild evolution without significant mergers is well consistent with the cfrs data excluding the ebgs , in the redshift range of @xmath4 .    in the above analysis",
    "we have assumed the @xmath14-dominated universe with @xmath58 .",
    "here we repeat the calculations using the einstein - de sitter ( eds ) universe with @xmath59 and the low - density , open universe with @xmath60 .",
    "the results for three universe models are tabulated in table 1 , provided that the ebgs are removed from the sample .",
    "the average @xmath2increases with increasing @xmath26 or decreasing @xmath27 , and @xmath2of elliptical galaxies is consistent with 0.5 in all the three universe models .",
    "the @xmath0of e / s0 in the eds universe , 0.519 , should be compared to 0.410 of kcw .",
    "the average @xmath2for the composite of all types is consistent with 0.5 in the @xmath14-dominated universe , and our hypothesis of mild evolution favors this universe .",
    "we furthermore repeat the calculations using the no - evolution model of galaxies ( i.e. , only @xmath40-correction is included ) , and the result is shown in the table for the purpose of comparison .",
    "it is evident that galaxy evolution is only a small effect in the @xmath0test as far as @xmath1 , and our results are hardly affected by uncertainties of the galaxy evolution model .",
    "in addition to the selection bias in the cfrs mentioned in the previous section , our use of ay model for e / s0 is also responsible for the conclusion presented here which is in sharp contrast with kcw s conclusion .",
    "the behavior of kcw s evolution model at @xmath61 is similar to the ay model , except for @xmath62 0.5 mag blueward shift probably due to their choice of a constant value of lower metallicity for all stellar populations .",
    "it should be noted that an average of absolute magnitude for the cfrs galaxies of e / s0 type is @xmath63 , after corrected to @xmath64 , which obviously corresponds to the ay @xmath65 ( baryon ) models with the luminosity - weighted average of stellar metallicities equal to @xmath66 of the solar ( see table 3 of ay ) . on the other hand ,",
    "kcw s use of much lower metallicity of @xmath67 of the solar is equivalent to using the ay @xmath68 ( baryon ) model with @xmath69 which corresponds to much smaller e / s0 galaxies not observed in the cfrs .",
    "this suggests that kcw s evolution model is inappropriate to place a color boundary between e / s0 and other types for the cfrs sample .",
    "in fact , kcw have also noticed the selection bias against early - type galaxies at redshifts close to unity in the cfrs sample . since the @xmath10 colors are available for the cfrs galaxies with no redshift identifications , kcw evaluated a maximum redshift for which each unidentified galaxy would still lie above the kcw s curve in fig .",
    "1 ( the dotted line ) and be classified as early type . they performed the @xmath0test including the unidentified galaxies with these maximum redshifts and obtained @xmath2= 0.451 which is still smaller than 0.5 .",
    "it should be noted that kcw s estimte of the maximum redshifts is heavily based on the steep rise of their model at @xmath70 in fig .",
    "1 . in contrast",
    ", our models of e / s0 and sab , which are considered to be more appropriate for analyzing the cfrs sample , do not show such a steep rise probably because of the longer duration of starbursts ( 0.7gyr compared to 0.1 gyr in kcw ) and hence it is difficult or even impossible to define the maximum redshift for the unidentified , red galaxies .",
    "therefore , we consider that the estimate of the maximum redshifts is highly uncertain , and the incompleteness should be avoided by performing the @xmath0test only in the range in which spectroscopic redshifts are secured with confidence .",
    "let us discuss more about the nature of ebgs , which are distributed widely in the redshift range of @xmath71 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : color - z ] ) .",
    "the fact that their @xmath2value is larger than 0.5 suggests that the ebgs , soon after observed at @xmath22 , must disappear or change their color to be classified as redder galaxies .",
    "a likely mechanism for such sudden fading or reddening is that the ebgs are being observed during intensive starburst as inferred from their extremely blue colors . in either cases the evolution of the ebgs",
    "may not be predicted by the usual sdm models including ours , in which the star formation rate is nearly constant to make the present colors as blue as local sdm galaxies .",
    "however , if the star formation is suddenly stopped on the way , the colors turn considerably redder than predicted by the sdm model .",
    "it is therefore tempting to examine whether such starburst models for the ebgs lead to @xmath2@xmath72 for the whole cfrs galaxies .    in this letter , we have performed a detailed @xmath0test for the cfrs sample taking into account the ay and ayt models of galaxy evolution .",
    "our hypothesis that all field galaxies evolve mildly according to type - dependent star formation histories without significant mergers is consistent with the cfrs data in @xmath4 excluding ebgs , especially in the @xmath14-dominated universe .",
    "consequently , the rejetion of passive evolution of ellipticals claimed by kcw is not valid .",
    "the cfrs data do not allow us to discriminate between the passive evolution and the number evolution of ellipticals claimed by kcw .    if we parametrize the evolution of comoving number density of e / s0 galaxies as @xmath73 , then the analysis in the limited redshift range of @xmath4 gives @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 for the eds , open , and @xmath14-dominated universe models , respectively .",
    "the errors are larger than kcw s errors , because the redshift range is limited in our analysis . for all the cfrs galaxies excluding the ebgs , the analysis within the same redshift range gives @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 in the same order as above .",
    "these @xmath80 values , though not so significant as claimed by kcw , would impose an important constraint on the number evolution of field galaxies in the framework of the hierarchical clustering of galaxies in the universe .    this work has been supported in part by the grant - in - aid for scientific research ( 3730 ) and center - of - excellence ( coe ) research ( 07ce2002 ) of the ministry of education , science , and culture of japan .",
