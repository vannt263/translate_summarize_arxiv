    "the measurements suggest the presence of an uncompensated induced magnetic moment in a ybco layer close to the ybco / lcmo interface . as manganite layers undergo a ferromagnetic transition at around 180 k , the large dichroism at the mn @xmath0 edge",

    "similar behavior was also found for cu , except that already above 150 k its xmcd signal decreases below the detection limit . from the similar temperature dependences of the xmcd spectra authors",
    "concluded that the magnetic moment on cu is induced by strong interactions between cu spins and the ferromagnetic moment of mn across the interface .",
    "later , x - ray absorption spectra ( xas ) and x - ray linear dichroism ( xld ) at mn and cu @xmath0 edges were recorded in the total electron yield ( tey ) and fluorescence - yield ( fy ) modes from the same sample of ybco / lcmo sl .",

    "the cause of such a disagreement is yet unclear .",
    "one of possible reasons may be many - body effects , e.g. , the interaction of the partially filled mn @xmath19 states with a @xmath56 core hole , which is not taken into account in the theoretical calculations . the mn @xmath0 xmcd spectrum may change if the magnetization in interfacial mno@xmath1 planes is reversed relative to the rest of the lcmo layer or it may be strongly influenced by possible orbital ordering in lcmo .",
