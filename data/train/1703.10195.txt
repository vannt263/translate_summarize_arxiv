    "<S> also , any residual effects of the underlying box layer needs to be ruled out through systematic studies of qubit coherence versus undercut extent , in conjunction with 3d numerical modeling to determine more optimized qubit and membrane geometries . even while the precise physical and materials limitations of our system are unclear , current coherence times are sufficient for many quantum simulation and quantum optics experiments . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , our realization of a highly coherent soi qubit represents an essential building block for hybrid electro - opto - mechanical systems on soi . </S>",
    "<S> already , electromechanical and optomechanical coherent transduction bandwidths exceed the bandwidth of our qubit by a factor of two  @xcite , a prerequisite for high - fidelity , bi - directional microwave - to - optical quantum state transduction  an interesting and challenging research program in its own right , with many potential realizations .    </S>",
    "<S> overall , our fabrication and measurements of planar qubits on silicon and soi represent a modest but important technical stepping stone on the path to a variety of potential quantum information and quantum science goals . taken together with complementary advances in the fields of cavity opto- and electro - mechanics  @xcite , and in the context of competing systems  @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> we are optimistic about the potential for hybrid quantum systems and circuit qed on silicon and silicon - on - insulator platforms . </S>"
