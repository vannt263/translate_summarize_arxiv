    "random walk in random environment is a simple but powerful model for a variety of phenomena including homogenization in disordered materials @xcite , dna chain replication @xcite , crystal growth @xcite and turbulent behavior in fluids @xcite .",

    "during last ten years , interesting progress has been achieved specially in the case in which the movement takes place on the hypercubic lattice @xmath0 and the environment is i.i.d . , establishing relations between directional transience , ballisticity and the existence of an asymptotic direction and the law of the environment in finite regions . to a great extent , these arguments are no longer valid when the i.i.d .",
    "assumption is dropped .    in this article",
    "we focus on the problem of finding local conditions on the environment which ensure the existence of a deterministic asymptotic direction for the random walk model in contexts where the environment is not necessarily i.i.d . as it will be shown in section [ sex ] , there exist environments which are ergodic and for which there does not exist a deterministic asymptotic direction .",
    "therefore , some kind of mixing or ballisticity condition should be imposed on the environment .",
    "here we establish the existence of an asymptotic direction for random walks in random environments which are uniformly elliptic , are cone mixing @xcite , and satisfy a non - effective version of the polynomial ballisticity condition introduced in @xcite with high enough degree of the decay .",

    "the term _ almost _ is used because in these examples the non - effective polynomial ballisticity condition is satisfied with a low degree .",
    "this shows that somehow , while the mixing and non - effective polynomial conditions we will impose do imply the existence of an asymptotic direction , they might not necessarily imply the existence of a non - vanishing velocity .    for @xmath1 ,",

    "is established for random walks in cone - mixing environments which also satisfy a version of kalikow s condition , but under an additional assumption of existence of certain moments of approximate regeneration times .",
    "this assumption is unsatisfactory in the sense that it is in general difficult to verify if for a given random environment it is true or not . on the other hand , as it will be shown in section [ sex ] , there exist examples of random walks in a random environment satisfying the cone - mixing assumption for which the law of large numbers is not satisfied , while an asymptotic direction exists . from this point of view ,",
