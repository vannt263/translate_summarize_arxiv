    "the study of nuclei in out - off equilibrium configurations in many - body quantum theory is a very complicated problem .",
    "however , due to their long mean - free path inside the nucleus and to their large amplitude zero point motion associated to a strong delocalization of their wave - packet , nucleons could be often regarded as independent fermions moving within a mean potential .",
    "indeed , such theory , called time - dependent hartree - fock theory ( tdhf ) , first applied to nuclear dynamics some twenty years ago by bonche _",
    "et al _ @xcite , is able to reproduce quantitatively many properties of heavy - ion collisions@xcite .",
    "however , in this theory , nucleons interact only through the mean - field and collisions between particles are neglected .",
    "it is difficult to believe that correlations induced by collisions do not play also an important role when highly dissipative processes are involved .",
    "for example , thermalization of single - particle degrees of freedom@xcite and damping of collective motion@xcite could only be understood by the introduction of two - body correction .",
    "furthermore , usual mean - field theory is not able to reproduce the large experimental width of mass produced during heavy - ion reactions at intermediate energies .    in the extended time - dependent hartree - fock ( etdhf )",
    "theory , the description is improved beyond the mean - field approximation by incorporating correlations in the form of a quantal collision term@xcite . due to the numerical complexity , the applications of this theory on realistic situations remain a difficult problem , and therefore only a few approximate calculations have been performed so far@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we describe the basic features of the etdhf approach , propose a method for obtaining numerical solutions of the theory , and present an application of the method to an exactly solvable model .",
    "the exact description of a quantum system is contained in the many - body density operator @xmath0 and its dynamical evolution is given by the liouville - von neumann equation @xmath1    \\label{neumann}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the system has a _ a priori _ a large number of degrees of freedom , the practical resolution of equation ( [ neumann ] ) is often impossible .",
    "the basic assumption of mean - field theory is to suppose that only one - body observables are important in the description of the system ( neglecting , by the way , all correlations of order greater or equal to two ) .",
    "usual mean - field theory neglect completely two - body dynamics and values of two - body observables are obtained assuming that they are equal to the least biased value when one - body observables are known@xcite . in this",
    "approaches , all relevant information is contained in the one - body density operator @xmath2 and the dynamical evolution is replaced by@xcite @xmath3 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the mean field associated to @xmath5 .",
    "this approximate theory is already a many - body theory for out - off equilibrium finite system .",
    "note that , even if two - body dynamics are not explicitly included , non trivial correlations between single particle states exists due to the reorganization of the mean - field during the time evolution .",
    "+ however , this two - body correlation is not sufficient to reproduce the many facet of nuclei desexcitation . in particular",
    ", no dissipation , characteristic of the irreversible flow from collective motion to single particle degrees of freedom@xcite and expected to be responsible of the thermalization of nuclei , is included . the next step",
    "towards extended mean - field is to include information about two - body correlation dynamics .",
    "this could be obtained in particular by a truncation of the bbgky hierachy@xcite to the two first equations .",
    "this approaches assumed that tdhf is already a good approximation of the dynamics and two - body correlations are supposed only to act as a small perturbation added on top of the mean - field .",
    "this leads to a correction factor in the evolution of the one - body density operator@xcite @xmath6 + k(\\hat{\\rho } )   \\label{evol}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath7 \\\\",

    "( [ etdhf ] ) is the starting point of most of the theories that goes beyond tdhf .",
    "for example , all semi - classical applications which include collision effects@xcite ( namely buu approaches ) can be derived from it , by developing the wigner transform of ( [ evol ] ) up to first order in @xmath16 . over the past decade ,",
    "significant progresses have been made on the description of nuclear dynamics within semi - classical transport theories and extension of mean - field seems to be a promising tool for describing dynamics .",
    "however , nuclei are quantum objects even under extreme conditions and important physical component are missing in a semi - classical treatment .",
    "some attempts in order to treat the collision term in a quantum picture already exists@xcite . nevertheless , due to the complicated expression of @xmath17 , theses investigations have been carried out under strong approximations .    here , we describe a procedure for treating the collision term ( [ etdhf ] ) with minimum bias and which may be adapted for solving the etdhf equation in realistic situations under reasonable numerical approximations .",
    "in a single particle bases , the one - body density operator reads @xmath18 and the evolution equation take the form@xcite @xmath19 with    @xmath20    this expression is the most general one could extract from ( [ etdhf ] ) .",
    "we know from work of @xcite , that approximations in ( [ f _ _ ] ) leads to important change in physical results .",
    "in particular , the time integration is often replaced by a conservation of energy based on a markovian approximation of the collision but we know that this memory effect is important since it creates the non - trivial coupling between collective and single particle motions . furthermore , we are obligated to consider the non - diagonal part of ( [ f _ _ ] ) which will give the coherent evolution of single - particle states .",
    "a direct resolution of ( [ f _ _ ] ) needs a large numerical effort .",
    "however , in the following , we will see that it could be considerably simplified without loosing its generality .      supposing that we know the one - body density at time @xmath21 : @xmath22    from information theory , it means that we have access to the least biased description of our system when only one - body observables are known",

    "one - body space could be represented by a manifold in a bigger space ( see fig .",

    "suppose that we start from one point on this manifold .",
    "the exact dynamical evolution could be represented schematically by a trajectory in this space . due to the presence of two - body correlations ,",
    "the trajectory will not remain in the one - body space .",
    "nevertheless , the exact trajectory is associated to a path in the one - body space which reproduce the one - body dynamics of the exact evolution .",
    "the goal of using mean - field theory is to predict this trajectory . in the one - body space",
    ", the tdhf theory corresponds also to a trajectory .",
    "however , due to the neglected two - body correlations dynamics , usual mean - field is not able to reproduce the long - time evolution of the system .",
    "this is symbolized in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , by a strong departure of the tdhf theory from the best one - body trajectory .",
    "the goal of etdhf is to correct the mean - field evolution in order to be a much better approximation of the best trajectory .",
    "however , some remarks are in order :    * whereas tdhf fails to reproduce the long time evolution due to accumulated errors on two - body observables , one - body dynamics remains dominant .",
    "it implies that it exists a typical macroscopic time interval @xmath23 during which mean - field is a good approximation of the dynamics .",
    "this time interval is of the order of the time between two collisions .",
    "note that , a basic assumption of etdhf and tdhf is that this time interval is large compared to the typical time - scale of mean - field evolution . * for time greater or equal to @xmath24 , two - body correlations appear as a small correction to the mean - field and could be treated in perturbation .",
    "it enable us to coarse - grain the time evolution for the extended mean - field dynamics . instead of solving equation ( [ evol ] ) in time",
    ", we will divide the evolution into two step :    * the hartree - fock states will be evolved through the usual tdhf equation between @xmath21 and @xmath25 @xmath26 * we then use the perturbation theory in order to correct the one - body density by the error accumulated during @xmath24 associated with ( [ f_l ] ) .",

    "the etdhf procedure is expected to follow the best trajectory in the one - body manifold.,width=529,height=302 ]      in order to express different operator matrices elements , we need _ a priori _ a complete basis of the single - particle space .",
    "however , this could rarely be obtained in a problem with a huge number of degrees of freedom . on the other hand ,",
    "if we suppose to have such a basis , only few of the states will be necessary in order to have the main information about the system ( the rest corresponding to configuration which are not accessible ) . in a previous application@xcite",
    ", the author proposes to include only a part of the hartree - fock bases ( including all occupied states (  hole states  ) and few unoccupied states (  particle states  ) ) and to follow them with time .",
    "however , the system could reach many different configurations and single - particle states that were not included at the initial time could become important .",
    "it is thus difficult to believe that one can choose the basis at the initial time .",
    "conversely , at each coarse - grained time step @xmath24 , we will construct a bases that contains the important information about different configurations accessible to the system between a given time @xmath21 and @xmath25 . according to this procedure ,    at a given time @xmath21",

    "this give the natural truncation energy for the basis : @xmath39    @xmath35 in order to find states with low energy , we apply an imaginary time method to hartree - fock states .",
