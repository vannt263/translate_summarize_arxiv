    "the interplay of e - e and e - ph interactions in these correlated systems leads to coexistence of or competition between various phases such as superconductivity , cdw , spin - density - wave ( sdw ) phases , or formation of novel non - fermi liquid phases , polarons , bipolarons , etc .",
    "it is of particular interest to consider both the strong coupling regime , and the cross - over to the non - adiabatic limit where the lattice response is not slower in comparison to the heavy effective mass of the correlated electron system .",
    "the simplest framework to analyze the effects of e - e and the concomitant e - ph interactions is offered by the hubbard - holstein model whose hamiltonian is given by : h_hh & = & -t_j(c^_j+1c_j+ h.c . ) + _ 0_ja_j^a_j + & & + g_0_jn_j(a_j+a_j^ ) + u_jn_jn_j .",

    "the holstein and the hubbard models are recovered in the limits @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively .    to gain insight into the rich physics of the hubbard - holstein model , several studies have been conducted ( in one- , two- , and infinite - dimensions and at various fillings ) by employing various approaches such as quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) @xcite , exact diagonalization @xcite , density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg)@xcite , dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) @xcite , semi - analytical slave boson approximations @xcite , large - n expansion @xcite , variational methods based on lang - firsov transformation @xcite , and gutzwiller approximation @xcite .",
    "in contrast to earlier approaches , we utilize a controlled analytic approach ( that takes into account quantum phonons ) .",
    "our method uses both the strong electron - phonon coupling limit @xmath17 and the strong coulomb coupling limit @xmath18 to generate an effective @xmath19 model with displaced oscillators that can then be treated perturbatively , and generates longer - range interactions in an effective hamiltonian .",

    "is increased , the system sequentially transforms from an af cluster phase to a correlated singlet phase followed by cdw phase(s ) with ( e - ph coupling @xmath5 dependent ) accompanying spin order .",
    "the most interesting feature is that , at intermediate values of @xmath3 and for all strong e - ph couplings ( @xmath2 ) considered , a phase comprising of correlated nn singlets appears which suggests the possibility for superconductivity occurrence .",
