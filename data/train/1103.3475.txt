    "in this paper we consider the simplest of electrical networks , namely those that consist of only resistors .",
    "the electrical properties of such a network @xmath4 are completely described by the _ response matrix _ @xmath5 , which computes the current that flows through the network when certain voltages are fixed at the boundary vertices of @xmath4 .",
    "the study of the response matrices of _ planar _ electrical networks has led to a robust theory , see curtis - ingerman - morrow @xcite , or de verdire - gitler - vertigan @xcite . in 1899 , kennelly @xcite described a local transformation ( see figure [ fig : elec11 ] ) of a network , called the _ star - triangle _ or _",
    "@xmath6 _ transformation , which preserves the response matrix of a network .",
    "this transformation is one of the many places where a yang - baxter style transformation occurs in mathematics or physics .",
    "curtis - ingerman - morrow @xcite studied the operations of _ adjoining a boundary spike _ and _ adjoining a boundary edge _ to ( planar ) electrical networks .",
    "our point of departure is to consider these operations as one - parameter subgroups of a lie group action .",
    "the star - triangle transformation then leads to an `` electrical serre relation '' in the corresponding lie algebra , which turns out to be a deformation of the chevalley - serre relation for @xmath7 : @xmath8 = 0   \\qquad \\text{electrical serre relation : } \\;[e,[e , e ' ] ] = -2e\\ ] ] the corresponding one - parameter subgroups satisfy a yang - baxter style relation which is a deformation of lusztig s relation in total positivity : @xmath9 we study in detail the lie algebra @xmath10 with @xmath11 generators satisfying the electrical serre relation .",
    "an ( electrically ) nonnegative part @xmath1 of the corresponding lie group @xmath12 acts on planar electrical networks with @xmath13 boundary vertices , and one obtains a dense subset of all response matrices of planar networks in this way .",
    "this nonnegative part is a rather precise analogue of the totally nonnegative subsemigroup @xmath14 of the unipotent subgroup of @xmath15 , studied in lie - theoretic terms by lusztig @xcite .",
    "we show ( proposition [ p : decomp ] ) that @xmath1 has a cell decomposition labeled by permutations @xmath16 , precisely paralleling one of lusztig s results for @xmath17 and reminiscent of the bruhat decomposition . this can be considered an algebraic analogue of parametrization results in the theory of electrical networks @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , @xmath12 itself is isomorphic to the symplectic lie group @xmath18 ( theorem [ thm : elsp ] ) .",
    "this semisimplicity does not in general hold for electrical lie groups : @xmath19 is not semisimple .",
    "we also describe ( theorem [ thm : stab ] ) the stabilizer lie algebra of the infinitesimal action of @xmath10 on electrical networks .",
    "while we focus on the planar case in this paper , we shall connect the results of this paper to the inverse problem for electrical networks on cylinders in a future paper .",
    "there we borrow ideas from representation theory such as that of crystals and @xmath20-matrices .",
    "one obtains the types @xmath21 and @xmath22 electrical serre relations by the standard technique of `` folding '' the type @xmath0 electrical serre relation .",
    "these lead to a new species of electrical lie algebras @xmath23 defined for any dynkin diagram @xmath24 .",
    "besides the above results for type @xmath0 , there appear to be other interesting relations between these @xmath23 and simple lie algebras .",
    "for example , @xmath25 is isomorphic to @xmath26 .",
    "we conjecture ( conjecture [ con:1 ] ) that for a finite type diagram @xmath24 , the dimension @xmath27 is always equal to the dimension of the maximal nilpotent subalgebra of the semisimple lie algebra @xmath28 with dynkin diagram @xmath24 , and furthermore ( conjecture [ con:2 ] ) that @xmath23 is finite dimensional if and only if @xmath28 is finite - dimensional .",
    "we give the electrical analogue of lusztig s relation for type @xmath21 ( see berenstein - zelevinsky @xcite ) where we observe similar positivity to the totally nonnegative case .",
    "the most interesting case beyond finite dynkin types is affine type @xmath0 .",
    "the corresponding electrical lie ( semi)-group action on planar electrical networks is perhaps even more natural than that of @xmath12 , since one can obtain _ all _ ( rather than just a dense subset of ) response matrices of planar networks in this way ( @xcite ) , and furthermore the circular symmetry of the planar networks is preserved .",
    "we however do not attempt to address this case in the current paper .",
    "for more background on electrical networks , we refer the reader to @xcite .      for our purposes ,",
    "an electrical network is a finite weighted undirected graph @xmath4 , where the vertex set is divided into the _ boundary _ vertices and the _ interior _ vertices .",
    "the weight @xmath29 of an edge is to be thought of as the conductance of the corresponding resistor , and is generally taken to be a positive real number",
    ". a @xmath30-weighted edge would be the same as having no edge , and an edge with infinite weight would be the same as identifying the endpoint vertices .",
    "we define the _ kirchhoff matrix _ @xmath31 to be the square matrix with rows and columns labeled by the vertices of @xmath4 as follows : @xmath32    we define the _ response matrix _ @xmath5 to be the square matrix with rows and columns labeled by the boundary vertices of @xmath4 , given by the schur - complement @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the submatrix of @xmath35 indexed by the interior vertices .",
    "the response matrix encodes all the electrical properties of @xmath4 that can be measured from the boundary vertices .",
    "we shall usually consider electrical networks @xmath4 embedded into a disk , so that the boundary vertices , numbered @xmath36 , lie on the boundary of the disk .",
    "given an odd integer @xmath37 , for @xmath38 , and a nonnegative real number @xmath39 , we define @xmath40 to be the electrical network obtained from @xmath4 by adding a new edge from a new vertex @xmath41 to @xmath42 , with weight @xmath43 , followed by treating @xmath42 as an interior vertex , and the new vertex @xmath41 as a boundary vertex ( now named @xmath42 ) .    given an even integer @xmath44 , for @xmath38 , and a nonnegative real number @xmath39 , we define @xmath45 to be the electrical network obtained from @xmath4 by adding a new edge from @xmath42 to @xmath46 ( indices taken modulo @xmath13 ) , with weight @xmath39 .",
