    "is the possibility of black hole creation in high - energy particle collisions  @xcite . in most gravitational processes , such as those involving graviton emission and exchange , analyses rely on a perturbative description that breaks down for center - of - mass energies of @xmath1 and above .",
    "in contrast , black hole properties are best understood for energies above @xmath1 , where semi - classical and thermodynamic descriptions become increasingly valid  @xcite . in principle , then , black holes provide a robust probe of extra dimensions and low - scale gravity , as long as particle collisions with center - of - mass energies above @xmath3 are available .",

    "the cross section is highly insensitive to choice of momentum transfer  @xcite ; _ e.g. _ , the choices @xmath36  @xcite and @xmath37  @xcite , lead to cross section differences of only 10% to 20% .",

    "this cosmogenic flux is subject to a number of quantitative uncertainties , including cosmological source evolution . as representative fluxes",
    ", we consider the recent results presented in fig .  4 of ref .",
    "these fluxes are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : engel - nu - cmb ] .",
    "second , gamma ray bursts have also been considered as a possible source of the highest energy cosmic rays .",
    "if this is the case , fermi accelerated protons from shocks will generate extremely high energy neutrinos with energy spectrum @xmath64  @xcite .",
    "this neutrino flux , as well as those from other compact sources , such as active galactic nuclei , is limited by the waxman - bahcall ( wb ) bound  @xcite .",
    "this constraint is valid for all astrophysical neutrino sources that are optically thin to @xmath65 and @xmath66 interactions .",
    "we consider a conservative estimate of this bound , @xmath67  @xcite , where here @xmath68 .",
    "this flux is also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : engel - nu - cmb ] .",
    "it is approximately equal to the cosmogenic flux for @xmath39 , but is much larger for lower ( and higher ) energies .",
    "third , if the highest energy cosmic rays observed are generated by the annihilation of superheavy dark matter particles or from the decay of topological defects , neutrinos will also be produced .",
    "such fluxes have been described in refs .",
    "we will not discuss these sources further , but note that they may predict large neutrino fluxes at extremely high energies , enhancing the results given below .    in propagating to the earth , the neutrino fluxes of fig .",
    "[ fig : engel - nu - cmb ] will mix  @xcite .",
    "given the solutions preferred by neutrino oscillation experiments and the enormous distances traveled , we take the neutrinos that reach the earth to be in the ratio @xmath69 and similarly for anti - neutrinos .",
    "with regard to signals at neutrino telescopes , black hole evaporation products may be divided into three categories : showers ( hadronic and electromagnetic ) , muons , and taus .",
    "black holes also decay to neutrinos , but we neglect this flux in this work .",
    "the ranges of typical hadronic and electromagnetic showers are much less than the linear dimension of large - scale neutrino telescopes , and so , to first approximation , only contained showers from black holes produced inside the detector may be detected . the backgrounds for showers from black hole evaporation consist of hadronic showers from neutral and charged current neutrino events and electromagnetic showers from charged current electron neutrino events .",
    "at icecube , hadronic shower energies should be measurable with an accuracy of about 30% .",
    "in contrast to showers , at the typical energies of black hole events , muons travel several kilometers before losing a decade of energy . the dominant signal is therefore through - going muons .",
    "icecube can measure the energy and direction of any observed muon .",
    "the angular resolution is about @xmath70 while the energy resolution is approximately a factor of three .",
    "signal and background muons may therefore be differentiated with an energy cutoff .",
    "as we will see , for down - going muons with energy above 500 tev to 1 pev , the black hole signal may be well above the sm background from atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "note that for black holes produced sufficiently near the detector , muon events may be obscured by showers .",
    "this occurrence is rare , however , and we ignore this possibility below .    at high energies ,",
    "when tau decay is sufficiently time dilated , taus have ranges as large or larger than muons , and so the dominant tau signal is from through - going taus .",
    "these events have a characteristic signature consisting of a `` clean '' track , _",
    "i.e. _ , a track without much energy lost through low energy cascades",
    ". we will consider all events in which a tau track passes through the detector .",
    "taus can be differentiated from muons by the cleanliness of their tracks or through their decays in the detector leading to `` lollipop '' events  @xcite , described later in this paper .",
    "we assume that taus and muons are distinguishable at all energies , although it will be difficult to distinguish a slow muon of energy @xmath71 from a very high energy tau , as they can both generate clean , through - going tracks in the detector .",
    "very massive black holes with large multiplicity decays may evaporate to several muons ( or taus ) . however , these travel in coincidence through the detector .",
    "their angular spread is only @xmath72 , much less than a degree , and so can not be resolved with large cerenkov detectors such as icecube .",
    "spectacular multi - lepton signatures are therefore not possible .",
    "note , however , that more massive black holes are easier to detect , as they produce leptons with greater energy , which travel further before dropping below the cutoff energy .    to evaluate black hole detection prospects ,",
    "it is essential to determine , in a unified framework , both the sm background and the black hole event rate .",
    "we now describe both of these calculations .        in the sm ,",

    "are less attenuated than horizontal ones , and so the angular distribution is maximized for vertically down - going events .",
    "in contrast , as noted in sec .  [ sec : sm ] , vertically down - going muon and tau events can not benefit from muon and tau ranges beyond the depth of the detector ( @xmath156 km ) .",
    "the optimal direction for muon and tau events is therefore closer to the horizon . in scenarios with enhanced cross sections such as the one we are exploring in this paper ,",
    "the neutrino flux is attenuated even in the horizontal direction as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : muons_zenith ] and [ fig : taus_zenith ] . as a consequence , the quasi - horizontal direction with small but positive @xmath157 , where the effects of attenuation are maximally offset by lepton range , leads to the largest rates . for muons ,",
    "this optimal zenith angle is around @xmath158 . for taus , with even longer ranges , it is @xmath159 .",
    "these are general considerations that apply to the detection of ultra - high energy neutrinos in any scenario predicting enhanced cross sections with respect to the sm cross sections .",
    "energy distributions for the various channels are given in figs .",
    "[ fig : showers_edistr_down ] , [ fig : muons_edistr_down ] , and [ fig : taus_edistr_down ] . the energy distributions are clearly sensitive to @xmath62 and the presence or absence of exponential suppression in the parton cross section .",
    "different types of events therefore probe different and complementary aspects of black hole production and decay . by measuring the down - going energy distributions with reasonable statistics ,",
    "the icecube detector may be able to discriminate between the different possibilities .",
    "note that to facilitate comparison with conventional presentations of sm rates at neutrino telescopes , we have plotted distributions in initial neutrino energy .",
    "shower energies are related to these neutrino energies in a fairly direct way , and the shower energy distributions will have roughly the same shape .",
    "the energy distributions of through - going leptons may be significantly distorted , however , as the lepton energy is a function of black hole multiplicity as well as the distance the lepton propagates before reaching the detector .",
    "note also that , while shower energies should be well - measured , lepton energy measurements present significant challenges , especially for taus .",
    "lollipop tau events will be a clear tau signature with well - measured energy .",
    "however , determining the energy of through - going tau events will be difficult in icecube as they typically do not radiate and , therefore , appear similar to minimum ionizing muons with energy @xmath160 .",
    "more detailed detector simulations will be necessary to effectively use the information from through - going taus described in this paper .",
    "in the presence of tev - scale gravity and extra dimensions , ultra - high energy cosmic neutrinos may produce microscopic black holes in the surface of the earth .",
    "we have explored the prospects for detecting such events in neutrino telescopes .",
    "we considered contained showers , through - going muons , and also through - going taus .",
    "the rates for a @xmath126 detector , such as icecube , are of the order of a few per year in each channel for @xmath1 near current bounds .",
    "these rates are well above sm backgrounds , and provide a significant opportunity to observe black hole production . in several years of data taking at a kilometer - scale neutrino telescope , it should be possible to probe most of the cases described in this paper : values of @xmath9 well above 1 tev may be within reach , and observable event rates are even possible for exponentially suppressed parton cross sections . at the same time , these results imply that black hole observation at antares and nestor appears unlikely , given their effective areas of @xmath161 . the rice experiment  @xcite , which aims to detect coherent cerenkov radiation from electromagnetic and hadronic showers at frequencies of 100 mhz to 1 ghz , provides another interesting and complementary probe with effective volume for shower detection reaching @xmath162 above a few pev .",
    "the expected rates for black hole events are , of course , highly sensitive to the choice of neutrino flux .",
    "as this work was being completed , a paper also discussing black holes at neutrino telescopes appeared  @xcite .",
    "there , results for two fluxes are presented : a `` limit from hidden sources '' flux and a cosmogenic flux .",
    "the first flux is roughly 3 times higher than the limit placed by the amanda experiment on diffuse fluxes  @xcite .",
    "the wb flux we use is much more conservative and is roughly 2 orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "a variety of cosmogenic fluxes  @xcite are also considered in ref .",
    "our ratios of black hole to sm rates are in agreement , but here , too , it appears we have chosen a more conservative representative flux , leading to a factor of 3 to 5 fewer shower and muon events from cosmogenic neutrinos .",
    "the possibility of tau events , exponentially suppressed cross sections , and angle and energy distributions were not addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "relative to icecube , the prospects for black hole detection appear to be slightly brighter at the auger observatory , expected to be completed by 2004 , where tens of events per year may be discovered  @xcite .",
    "icecube is scheduled to reach its ultimate goal of @xmath163 in 2009 , but it will collect data continuously as it grows in stages , beginning with the existing amanda ii detector , roughly of area @xmath164 , and reaching a volume of around @xmath165 in 2006 .",
    "it is difficult to model this time - varying detection volume , but by 2007 , an integrated exposure of roughly @xmath166 will have been achieved .",
    "given the rates of tables  [ table : i]-[table : iii ] , we conclude that , for scenarios with @xmath1 near current bounds , icecube may detect black hole events along with the auger observatory before the lhc begins operation .    of course , enhanced event rates alone are not necessarily a signal of new physics .",
    "in particular , the uncertainty of astrophysical neutrino fluxes makes it difficult to determine whether observed events result from the sm or new physics based on counting experiments alone",
    ". comparisons of quasi - horizontal showers and earth - skimming neutrino rates provide a powerful discriminant in ground arrays  @xcite .",
    "however , the possibility of measuring relative event rates in three separate channels at icecube provides a direct , unique , and complementary tool for distinguishing black hole events from the sm and other new physics possibilities . as noted in sec .",
    "[ sec : distributions ] , angular and energy distributions will also be helpful to separate the signal of a large astrophysical flux from the signal of new physics .",
    "the separation of these channels in ground arrays and fluorescence detectors is extremely difficult .",
    "given sufficient statistics , then , the information provided by icecube may provide information on black hole branching ratios , and the various angle and energy distributions may also help distinguish various properties of black hole production and decay .",
    "black hole production may be the best prospect for discovering extra dimensions in the near future , and neutrino telescopes may be an excellent tool for studying them .",
    "we thank gonzalo parente for invaluable help with implementing the cteq parton distribution functions in our simulation , ralph engel for providing the cosmogenic neutrino flux , and alfred shapere for helpful conversations . j.a .-",
