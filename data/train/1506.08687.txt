    "topological systems are characterized by a bulk - edge correspondence where geometric properties of the bulk band - structure have a precise connection with the nature of excitations at the edge when the system is placed in a confined geometry . for an integer quantum hall system for example ,",

    "this correspondence implies that many bulk measurements are indirect probes of edge excitations as well .",
    "for example , the dc hall conductivity at zero temperature , ( which is equal to the hall conductance measured in a multi - terminal measurement  @xcite ) is universal @xmath1 , and proportional to the number of edge - states .",
    "moreover , the optical hall conductivity @xmath2 , while non - universal , nevertheless shows signatures of quantum hall plateaus as the external magnetic field is varied  @xcite .",
    "in fact an all optical measurement such as faraday rotation @xmath3 of linearly polarized light of frequency @xmath4 is related to the optical hall conductivity as @xmath5 [ @xmath6 being the fine - structure constant , and @xmath7 being a material dependent parameter such as the refractive index ]  @xcite , and has been used as an alternate probe of quantum hall physics , both in semiconductor heterostructures  @xcite , and graphene  @xcite .",
    "chern insulators are topological insulators ( tis ) which show quantum hall physics in the absence of a magnetic field , where time - reversal symmetry is broken by introducing complex hopping amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "this can be achieved by the application of a circularly polarized laser  @xcite , where tis arising out of such time - periodic perturbations are referred to as floquet tis ( ftis )  @xcite .",
    "the field of ftis has grown in recent years because of several experimental realizations ranging from periodically shaken lattices of cold - atomic gases  @xcite , to graphene  @xcite and dirac fermions on the surface of 3d tis  @xcite under external irradiation , and also arrays of twisted photonic waveguides  @xcite .",

    "the precise relaxation mechanisms need to be specified as they sensitively affect results .",
    "thus we present results for two rather different cases , one where the system is closed and the laser is switched on as a quench , while the second is when the system is coupled to an ideal reservoir , and so the steady - state loses memory of its initial state .",
    "yet being a driven dissipative system , the steady - state is far from thermal , resulting in some unusual behavior for the hall conductivity , which is sensitive to the topological phase , and can not be interpreted as simply `` heating '' .",
    "in fact we show that the laser parameters , and in particular the topological phase , strongly affects the effective system - reservoir coupling , and therefore the steady - state , and its hall response .",
    "the advantage of the optical hall conductivity is that it can be measured both in traditional multi - terminal measurements  @xcite , as well as completely optically via the faraday rotation , the latter being more suitable for present day experiments .",
    "in fact even the dc limit can be studied without leads , in optical lattices , by monitoring the transverse drift in time - of - flight measurements  @xcite . moreover while it is the dc ( @xmath16 ) limit of the hall conductivity , combined with an ideal electron distribution function , that is related to a topological quantity , namely the chern number of the floquet bands  @xcite , we show that even at non - zero frequencies , some features of the topological nature of the system survive . in particular , the berry - curvature of floquet bands is time - dependent , and we show that various frequency components of this berry - curvature can be directly probed in the optical hall conductivity .    the paper is organized as follows .",

    "this happens because the quasi - energy level separation near the dirac points and around the circles is not the same , with the former being larger than the latter .",
    "raising the temperature excites electrons to the `` down '' level near the circles , while excitations to the `` up '' level near the dirac cones do not occur until higher temperatures .",

    "the sign of the population difference follows the pattern in fig .",
    "[ mkna10 ] , leading to a dc hall conductivity that is not only small , but also has a non - monotonic temperature dependence .",

    "moreover , while we are studying the system in the bulk , and edges do not enter explicitly in our kubo formula approach , yet we do pick up a non - zero hall response coming from the non - zero berry - curvature of the bulk bands .    while so far we have been mainly discussing the low frequency hall response , we now make some general observations about the high frequency response .",
    "we find that for small amplitudes @xmath128 , @xmath129 is saturated by @xmath130 ( fig .",

    "in summary we have presented results for the optical hall conductivity which can be measured in an all optical measurement such as faraday rotation , as well as using leads .",
    "the low frequency hall conductivity , even in steady - state with a reservoir , is remarkably sensitive to the topological phase , which is communicated through the structure of the system - reservoir matrix elements , resulting in steady - states with anomalous temperature dependence , and also opening up the possibility of manipulating the steady - state by suitable reservoir engineering  @xcite , for example by applying strain fields that modify the symmetries of the electron - phonon coupling .",
    "we also find that the high - frequency response acts as a spectroscopic tool for the fourier components of the time - dependent berry curvature .",
    "we presented detailed results for the optical hall response in three different phases of the fti .",
    "one is where the chern number coincided with the number of edge - states which were all in the center of the fbz ( @xmath147 ) , the other where the chern number does not equal the number of edge - states but rather equals the difference in the number of chiral edge - states above and below the floquet band ( @xmath148 ) , while the third was one where @xmath119 ( @xmath149 ) , so that the band was not a conventional chern insulator , yet the system supports edge states with the number of chiral edge modes above and below the band equal to each other ( hence @xmath119 ) .",
    "an interesting future direction of research is to compare the results presented here which were based on a bulk kubo formula treatment , and which is sensitive to the bulk berry - curvature , with a landauer transport approach through a short sample where the leads determine the occupation of the floquet states .    _",
