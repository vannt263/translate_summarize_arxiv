    "the relation at @xmath2 is linear except in the very lowest luminosity galaxies @xcite .",

    "the linearity and normalization of the frc provide strong constraints on the magnetic energy density in galaxies , which governs the strength of synchrotron losses . indeed , the energy density of starlight in dense galaxies is so large that inverse compton losses alone shorten the cr electron and positron lifetime to @xmath7 in galaxies like arp 220 @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field in arp 220-like starbursts must exceed mg for the cosmic ray electrons and positrons to radiate a large enough fraction of their energy in synchrotron emission to account for the observed ghz radio emission .",
    "such galaxies are likewise sufficiently dense that ionization and bremsstrahlung losses are also rapid .",
    "these considerations imply that the magnetic energy density must increase dramatically from normal spirals to dense bright starbursts .",
    "the observed schmidt law allows us to quantify these dependences since it connects the star - formation rate surface density ( @xmath8 ) , which is proportional to the energy density in starlight ( @xmath9 ) , to the gas surface density : @xmath10 according to @xcite , or @xmath11 according to @xcite . using the @xcite schmidt law",

    "this strong dependence of @xmath12 on the global properties of the galaxy is largely responsible for the radio emission from starbursts and is required by the existence of the frc .",
    "it is also crucial to the physics of how the frc is maintained or broken at high z. ltq was unable to distinguish between the possibilities of @xmath12 scaling with @xmath16 and @xmath12 scaling with @xmath17 .",
    "ltq found that over most of the range of the frc , normal galaxies and starbursts are calorimetric .",
    "they are electron calorimeters , meaning cr electrons lose most of their energy before escaping .",
    "they are also uv calorimeters , meaning uv light is efficiently absorbed by dust and converted to fir light .",
    "if cr electrons cool mainly by synchrotron losses , then the ratio of fir emission to radio emission from primary cr electrons should be constant , since each is some fraction of the power released by star - formation .",
    "this is the essence of calorimeter theory , first proposed by @xcite .",
    "however , ltq found that even in this strict calorimeter limit , @xmath18 should decrease systematically by @xmath19 from low surface brightness galaxies to dense ulirgs .",
    "the critical synchrotron frequency causes this `` @xmath20 effect '' : at fixed frequency , as the magnetic field strength increases with increasing surface density , lower energy electrons dominate the synchrotron emission because the synchrotron frequency of electrons , @xmath20 , is proportional to @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the electron energy . since the injected cr spectrum is likely steeper than @xmath23 , there is more power radiated at low energies .",
    "thus , radio emission increases with surface density of gas and star formation , even including only synchrotron losses in the pure electron and uv calorimeter limit .    on top of calorimetry",

    "high surface density compact starbursts have two completely different opposing processes that affect the radio emission .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the secondary electrons and positrons themselves emit synchrotron radio emission , and outnumber the primary cr electrons .",
    "proton calorimetry therefore greatly enhances the radio emission , all else being equal .",
    "although escape losses are negligible in starbursts , synchrotron does compete with the other important cooling processes : inverse compton , bremsstrahlung , and ionization ( * ? ? ?",
    "these are particularly important in bright , dense starbursts , because they have very high gas densities and photon energy densities .",
    "these other losses reduce the share of cr electron and positron power going into radio by a factor of @xmath30 . between the secondaries and the @xmath20 effect increasing @xmath31 , and the non - synchrotron losses suppressing @xmath31 ,",
    "a linear frc correlation is produced .",
    "this is the `` high-@xmath16 conspiracy '' of ltq , and it operates to produce a linear frc even though these starbursts are completely calorimetric ( for protons , electrons , and positrons ) and escape losses are negligible .    galaxies at high redshift can be used to test the theory of the frc presented in ltq . at high @xmath1",

    "importantly , puffy starbursts will have a smaller volume density for a given @xmath16 and @xmath8 .",

    "we therefore expect there to be a radio excess with respect to the frc in any puffy starburst with a strong enough magnetic field , with the exact enhancement depending on magnetic field strength because of the remaining competition , after ionization and bremsstrahlung are sub - dominant , from the ic losses on starlight .",

    "it is not entirely clear how long normal galaxies take to build up their magnetic fields , or even what process is at work ( see the reviews in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though there are theoretical mechanisms that can rapidly generate strong magnetic fields .",
    "studies at @xmath3 indicate that normal milky way - like galaxies had magnetic fields with similar strengths to the present @xcite . at the very highest redshifts ,",
    "magnetic field strengths might be weaker , because the seed fields were essentially zero compared to the present strengths . starbursts also may build their magnetic fields up in much shorter times than normal galaxies , and through a different process than normal galaxies @xcite .    finally , we have used one - zone models , which are appropriate if the crs sample all of the gas phases in each galaxy s ism .",
    "however , the ism is known to be clumpy in the milky way , in compact starbursts like arp 220 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and even in the smgs themselves @xcite .",
    "a full understanding of the frc will probably require models that take into account the inhomogeneity of star - forming galaxies .",

    "we would like to thank igor moskalenko for sharing his group s estimates of the milky way s total @xmath29-ray luminosity for normalization of our models of the frc .",
    "t.  a.  t. is supported in part by an alfred p. sloan fellowship .",
    "at high redshift , the nonthermal synchrotron radio luminosity of galaxies is suppressed by the cmb .",
    "this is because the inverse compton process shortens the lifetime that crs have to radiate synchrotron ; equivalently , their energy goes into inverse compton photons instead of synchrotron radio . because of the shorter times the cr electrons and positrons have to radiate synchrotron , the redshift @xmath101 when the radio luminosity of a galaxy is quenched by a factor @xmath227 is given by @xmath228 the loss time includes all cooling and escape losses , so that @xmath229 in some regimes , some losses may be neglected .",
    "for example , diffusive losses are unimportant in starbursts , as are ic losses off the cmb at @xmath86 .",
    "advective losses may be unimportant in normal galaxies and also for the densest starbursts .",
    "we can immediately see that the presence of losses besides synchrotron and ic off the cmb prevent the suppression of radio . in the case",
    "when no losses other than synchrotron and ic off the cmb exist , equation  [ eqn : radiosuppress ] reduces to @xmath230 the presence of other loss processes , whether escape or cooling , requires a higher @xmath101 for a fixed quench factor @xmath227 : @xmath231 essentially the ic losses off the cmb must compete with not only synchrotron losses , but every other cooling and escape process as well . with the high-@xmath16 conspiracy , @xmath232 can be of order @xmath233 , so the energy density of the cmb must be @xmath30 times greater to suppress the radio emission than would be naively expected .",
    "we give the loss times for each process in ltq . from those lifetimes",
    ", we can find the ratios of the synchrotron cooling timescale to the other loss timescales : @xmath234 where @xmath235 , @xmath236 , @xmath237 is the wind speed in units of 300 @xmath238 , and @xmath239 is the rest - frame frequency divided by 1.4 ghz .",
