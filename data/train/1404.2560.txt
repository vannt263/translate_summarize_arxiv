    "inflation , as proposed in early 1980s to address conceptual issues of the hot big bang cosmology  @xcite , has become the most successful paradigm of describing the very early universe .",
    "its profound prediction of a nearly scale - invariant primordial power spectrum has been verified to high precision by the observations on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) in recent years  @xcite . moreover , recently the bicep2 collaboration reported the detection of the cmb primordial @xmath0-mode polarization  @xcite .",
    "this observation , if confirmed to be originated from primordial gravitational waves , will be another major significance for inflation .",
    "the success of inflation , however , is based on a series of assumptions including the existence of a sufficiently long period of quasi - exponential expansion realized by an as yet undetermined physical mechanism , such as to introduce a slow - roll scalar field or to modify gravity theories .",
    "an important question to be addressed is how to formulate the effective field description from fundamental theories . in the literature , there have been many attempts of realizing the ( generalized ) starobinsky model  @xcite in the context of , namely , the supergravity descriptions  @xcite , the approach of asymptotically safe gravity  @xcite and the modified gravitational actions  @xcite .",
    "recently , a new class of models was developed in  @xcite , which suggested that inflation models with the same conformally described gauge invariance are observationally equivalent .",
    "specifically , a gravitational system involving a scalar field with a flattened potential can be derived by two - field theory with an approximate @xmath1 symmetry  @xcite which is invariant under a gauge transformation .",
    "this class of models was dubbed as t - models later  @xcite .",
    "the t - models , which can be realized in supergravity , predict small tensor - to - scalar ratio similar to starobinsky model .",
    "this original version of the t - models is however under danger because of the large @xmath0-mode detected by bicep2  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study possible extensions of t - models which are invariant under this same gauge transformation .",
    "we investigate the properties of the t - models and find that they can be embedded into a broader class which includes specific typical examples that covers a larger portion on the @xmath2-@xmath3 plane .",
    "especially , taking the recent observation on large @xmath0-modes in consideration , we can seek for a simple chaotic inflation model with a power - law potential  @xcite in such a class of conformally described models .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : model ]",
    "we briefly review the t - models and the gauge transformation under which the lagriangian is invariant .",
    "then , we extend it to a generalized description by introducing a non - trivial potential beyond the t - models . in section  [ sec : general ] we focus on some specific examples and study their cosmological implications , especially the predictions on the @xmath2-@xmath3 relationship . we compare the predictions with the recent bicep2 data on tensor modes .",
    "we then conclude in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "let us start by quickly reviewing the t - models proposed in  @xcite . if we write down a non - minimally coupled lagrangian with two real scalar fields , @xmath4 \\ , .\\ ] ] the negative sign of @xmath5 field seems dangerous , but it will not bring any classical instability since it is not a physical degree of freedom .",
    "it is invariant under the following local gauge transformations : @xmath6 this gauge invariance tells us that we can fix the gauge by choosing an appropriate field @xmath7 and get the physical degree of freedom .",
    "it looks like a conformal symmetry under this gauge transformation , but it is not as the metric is not changed physically but only redefined  @xcite .",
    "one can eliminate this degree of freedom by fixing a specific gauge , i.e. by choosing a specific function @xmath7 which may be arbitrary .",
    "a convenient choice is @xmath8 to realize this gauge fixing , it is also convenient to define a new field @xmath9 in terms of which @xmath5 and @xmath10 are written as @xmath11 and correspondingly , the lagrangian can be reformulated as@xmath12 \\,.\\ ] ] one can easily find this lagrangian is exactly the form of the starobinsky model @xmath13 in the einstein frame with @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "note that under the gauge condition ( [ gaugefix ] ) , slow - roll inflation occurs at @xmath15 , where an @xmath1 symmetry in field space is restored .",
    "the extension to this description , the so - called t - models  @xcite , has a general potential as compared to ( [ conformalstar ] ) , @xmath16 \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath17 is a function of @xmath18 .",
    "we can see that except for this @xmath17 factor , all the other terms preserves an extra @xmath1 symmetry in the field space of @xmath5 and @xmath10 .",
    "inflation happens in the neighborhood of the limit @xmath19 , where the @xmath1 symmetry is restored . as inflation proceeds",
    ", @xmath18 deviates from 1 monotonously . and",
    "finally inflation ends as the @xmath1 symmetry is completely broken . to study this deviation",
    ", we define a new variable @xmath20 one can see from this definition that unless @xmath5 and @xmath10 are complex fields with different phases , a real @xmath9 satisfying ( [ gaugefix ] ) will generate @xmath21 .",
    "a typical t - model chooses a specific form for the function @xmath17 as @xmath22 . with the gauge condition ( [ gaugefix ] ) ,",
    "the potential becomes simply @xmath23 the predictions for @xmath2 and @xmath3 are very close to that of the starobinsky model regardless the specific value of the exponent @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "that is , both the original starobinsky model and the t - models predict small tensor modes as is in tension with the recent bicep2 data .",
    "here we see that the @xmath1 symmetry plays a crucial rule in constructing the potential .",
    "if we preserve this symmetry in inflation , all the models generated from ( [ conformalt ] ) have similar predictions .",
    "however , as we will see in the next section , there exist other generalized models originating from this lagrangian that can give rise to different relations between @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "in this section we construct a broader class of models beyond t - models . to do this we abandon the preservation of the @xmath1 symmetry of the field space even during the inflationary period , but still keep the gauge invariance ( [ xform ] ) .",
    "in this case , the general potential of the action is @xmath25 the @xmath26 factor is necessary to keep the gauge invariance of the entire lagrangian .",
    "after we choose the conformal gauge as ( [ gaugefix ] ) , this potential can be expressed solely by @xmath27 defined in ( [ def : z ] ) as @xmath28 we can see that if @xmath29 is a smooth function , there exist two second - order poles , @xmath30 . in the present work ,",
    "we focus our interest on the case of real fields and hence the pole at @xmath31 will not be addressed .",
    "the existence of the pole at @xmath32 , however , would probably spoil the slow - roll requirements of inflationary cosmology due to the singular mathematical behavior around this position . in order to describe the dynamics of the inflationary phase ,",
    "it is convenient to define the slow - roll parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 as @xmath35 with @xmath36 \\equiv \\frac{g(z)}{\\sqrt{6 } } \\ , , \\ ] ] and @xmath37 of which the values are required to be much less than unity under the slow - roll condition .",
    "however , one can easily observe that when @xmath38 is close to @xmath39 , @xmath40 and in turn @xmath33 would be in general @xmath41 and the slow - roll condition is not guaranteed , unless @xmath42 contains a first order pole at @xmath32 with a residue equal to ( or close to ) @xmath43 .",
    "a simple case is the t - models where @xmath44  @xcite .",
    "then both second order poles in ( [ v(z ) ] ) are canceled and the potential is simply @xmath45 .",
    "another important case is the original starobinsky model  @xcite . the effective potential in ( [ starobinskylag ] )",
    "can be recovered from ( [ v(z ) ] ) once we choose @xmath46 .",
    "our next step is to seek for more general models from the above requirements .",
    "the exact form of @xmath47 with @xmath48 is not clear except for its asymptotic behavior @xmath49 to preserve the slow - roll conditions",
    ". a non - zero limit of @xmath50 will give rise to a starobinsky - like model equivalent to @xmath51 with an arbitrary exponent @xmath52 .",
    "as the predictions in this case are disfavoured by the bicep2 result as well , we will not discuss it in detail .",
    "for further discussions , see for instance @xcite . for simplicity ,",
    "let us just suppose that @xmath53 in this paper .",
    "even so , it is still difficult to determine the relation between @xmath33 and @xmath34 accurately . however , if @xmath54 is finite , we can make a tayler expansion of @xmath47 around @xmath55 as @xmath56 this yields @xmath57 up to the leading order of @xmath58 . after substituting it back into ( [ vslope ] )",
    ", we can see that the starobinsky model is a special case when @xmath59 thus @xmath60 . if @xmath61 , we have to go to higher order in ( [ gexpansion ] ) .",
    "let us assume that the first @xmath62 terms of the taylor series are all zero , and ( [ gexpansion ] ) begins from @xmath63 then we find a solution @xmath64 \\ , , \\ ] ] which deviates from the starobinsky model only up to next - to - leading order .",
    "an interesting case occurs when @xmath47 is not an analytic function at @xmath65 and in the meanwhile @xmath54 is divergent .",
    "namely , we consider a toy model @xmath66 where @xmath65 is a removable singularity and @xmath67 is a positive parameter .",
    "the minus sign is to make sure that @xmath68 for small @xmath58 .",
    "this can still preserve the slow - roll conditions , but now we can not have a general relationship as ( [ eta^2 ] ) . a particular solution to ( [ vslope ] ) , up to leading order , is now given by @xmath69 this gives us an effective potential @xmath70 , a dynamical modification to the power index .",
    "with this modification one can calculate the slow - roll parameter @xmath33 as @xmath71 whose solution can be expressed by the lambert @xmath72 function , @xmath73 \\ , .\\ ] ] note that the above two different expressions are mathematically equivalent due to the definition of the lambert @xmath72 function .",
    "the subscript @xmath74 denotes the lower branch of the lambert function , where we have @xmath75 therefore , we can obtain the spectral index of the power spectrum @xmath3 in terms of the tensor - to - scalor ratio @xmath2 through the following relation : @xmath76 \\left [ 1-\\frac{\\sqrt{3r}}{8\\lambda w_{-1}\\left(-\\sqrt{3r}/\\lambda \\right ) } \\right ] - \\frac{r}{8 } \\ , .\\ ] ] it is easy to check that the traditional result obtained by the starobinsky model can be recovered under the limit @xmath77 : @xmath78 .",

    "note that , in a realistic model this point corresponds to the true vacuum of the inflaton field after inflation and hence , there are several number of @xmath79-foldings overestimated in our expression ( which is associated with the preheating phase ) .",
    "however , this approximation would not alter the precise result and can greatly simplify the analytic analysis in the following . by solving ( [ n(z ) ] ) inversely , one can easily derive the variable @xmath38 as a function of @xmath98 : @xmath99 as well as the slow roll parameters @xmath100 this is as expected from the potential for chaotic inflation ( [ chaoticv ] ) .",
    "we explicitly show the predictions on the @xmath2-@xmath3 diagram with different values of @xmath87 in the right panel of figure  [ fig:2ex ] .",
    "since the coefficient @xmath87 is a free parameter in the conformally invariant description for inflation models , we specifically consider several parameter choices by taking different values of @xmath87 .",
    "one can see that the parameter choices for @xmath101 lie in the center of the contour provided by bicep2 .",
    "in particular , when @xmath102 , which corresponds to the standard @xmath103 inflation model , can fit to the data very well .",
    "as indicated by the recent bicep2 data with a high level detection of the primordial tensor modes , it seems that a class of inflation models such as t - models as well as the starobinsky model , is disfavoured .",
    "thus , it is interesting to study whether the formalism of the inflation models which the t - models originates remains of theoretical interest .",
    "this issue has been carried out from different viewpoints , see e.g.  @xcite for relevant discussions .    in the present article , we have developed a generalized class of the t - models which breaks the approximate @xmath1 symmetry .",
