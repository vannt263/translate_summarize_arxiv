    "the repair enzyme muty contains an evolutionary well - conserved [ 4fe4s ] cluster that is suspected to change its charge configuration from + 2 to + 3 upon binding to dna @xcite . upon binding to dna an electron is thus emitted into dna , while upon receipt of an electron from dna the muty - dna binding",
    "is destabilized . as only error - free stretches of dna are able to transport the electron from one muty enzyme to a neighboring muty enzyme @xcite this charge exchange enables muty to quickly free up scanning resources from error free stretches of dna @xcite  see figure [ fig1 ] . in the original proposal only muty enzymes participates in the current exchange and to illustrate the line of thought we first consider this scenario .",
    "afterward , we then extend the consideration to the case where there are many different kinds of repair enzymes each specialized to fix a specific kind of damage .",
    "furthermore , we also consider the effect of a finite scan length before muty spontaneously drops off dna .      after",
    "a a base pair get damaged , how long time does it take before a muty enzyme has located the error ? in the regime",
    "where current scanning yields a considerable speedup in the location of the error , the damaged base pair typically is located by a muty enzyme that binds to dna next to it and then scans all the way up to and including the faulty base pair ( and not by a muty enzyme that just happened to be nearby at the time of damage ) .",
    "let @xmath9 denote the typical detection time and @xmath10 the scan velocity of muty .",
    "the muty enzyme then typically docks onto dna within a distance of the order @xmath11 .",
    "the rate with which a muty enzyme randomly docks onto a specific base pair and start scanning is denoted by @xmath12 .",
    "the probability for a muty enzyme to land within a distance of @xmath11 of the error in the time interval @xmath9 can be estimated as @xmath13 .",
    "as at time @xmath9 a muty enzyme typically arrives at the faulty base pair this probability is of order 1 and @xmath14 a more detailed model calculation in the supplementary material yields the same result apart from a factor @xmath15 .",
    "the average docking rate @xmath12 can be expressed as @xmath16 where @xmath5 is the time between two successive binding events for a single muty enzyme .",
    "@xmath17 is the total number of muty enzymes and @xmath18 is the total number of base pairs in dna .",
    "@xmath19 is the time it takes for all the muty enzymes to scan all the bases of dna once . from standard poisson statistics",
    "@xmath4 is also the detection time of a damaged point in the traditional scenario without any cooperation between muty enzymes . in terms of @xmath4 and",
    "@xmath5 the detection time is @xmath20 the cooperation thus give a speed up of order @xmath21 . before i get down to consider numbers and orders of magnitude i want to make the model a tad more realistic .",
    "the functionally central [ 4fe4s ] cluster is also present in other repair enzymes e.g.   endonuclease iii .",
    "it is thus very likely that other repair enzymes also are able to inject currents into dna and participate in the electrical scanning of dna . furthermore all of these repair enzymes then get attracted to the damaged dna pair in exactly the same way as muty . in the above model and calculation we thus have to replace muty by any repair enzyme participating in the dna mediated charge transport",
    " for short just a repair enzyme below .",
    "likewise the calculated detection time @xmath9 becomes the time before the first repair enzyme finds the damaged site and @xmath4 the average time it take for any repair enzyme to find the site without using currents .",
    "i have here implicitly assumed that both the scan velocity @xmath10 and the single repair enzyme attempt frequency @xmath22 are of the same order of magnitude for all repair enzymes i.e.  muty is a typical repair enzyme . biologically the time @xmath9 is not the most relevant one as the first repair enzyme that arrives at the damaged base pair very likely is unable to fix the damage .",
    "for instance is muty s primary target oxidation damage resulting in g : a and 8-oxo - g : a mismatched pairs .",
    "instead the first muty enzyme arrives on average as the @xmath23 repair enzyme resulting in a detection time of order @xmath24 . here",
    "@xmath1 is the total number of repair enzymes .",
    "@xmath23 can also be expressed as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the time it takes for a muty enzyme to find the site by scanning alone .",
    "the muty detection time is thus @xmath27 again corresponding to a speedup of size @xmath21 , but this time @xmath4 is the time it take for any repair enzyme to locate the damage .",
    "i have not yet considered that muty is known spontaneously to drop off dna after having scanned of the order 100 base pairs ( bp ) @xcite . in order to estimate the effect of this i am going to derive the above result eq .",
    "( [ result full ] ) in a slightly different manner .",
    "the muty enzyme that eventually localizes the damage typically docks onto dna within a distance @xmath28 from the faulty base pair , where @xmath28 both has to be small enough to allow scanning all the way up to the error i.e.  @xmath29bp and also so small that it is unlikely another repair enzyme dock in front of the muty enzyme while it scans .",
    "the last length scale can be estimated to be of the order @xmath30 .",
    "the muty detection time @xmath31 is then determined as above by setting the probability for a muty enzyme to dock within a distance @xmath28 in the time interval @xmath31 equal to 1 i.e.   @xmath32 where @xmath33 .",
    "notice that the choice @xmath34 leads to eq .",
    "( [ result full ] ) .",
    "i have not been able to find any direct experimental measurements of @xmath5 and @xmath4 , so i am instead going to use a somewhat more uncertain way to estimate the size of the reduction @xmath35 .",
    "the distance @xmath36 is the average scan length of a repair enzyme ( muty ) in the presence of the current interactions .",
    "the numerator @xmath28 is the smallest of the maximal scan length 100bp and the docking distance @xmath37 .",
    "in fact , i believe these two distances are of the same order of magnitude as anything else seems inefficient , so i assume @xmath38bp , with equality as the most likely option .",
    "the distance @xmath39 is the average distance between repair enzymes .",
    "from this i can estimate @xmath36 .",
    "the reduction is thus @xmath40 , where @xmath1 is the total number of repair enzymes with a current exchange mechanism similar to muty and i have used that the length of e.colis dna is @xmath41 base pairs .",
    "unfortunately @xmath1 is unknown . in @xcite the number of",
    "the two [ 4fe4s]@xmath42 containing repair enzymes muty and endonuclease iii is estimated to be 30 and 400 respectively . in the same paper",
    "the number of formamidopyrimidine glycosylase ( fapy or mutm ) repair enzymes is estimated to 400 .",
    "fapy does not contain the [ 4fe4s]@xmath42 cluster .",
    "the target of fapy is 8oxog which is estimated to constitute 5% of all adducts due to oxidative damage @xcite .",
    "all in all it seems reasonable that the total number of repair enzymes participating in the current exchange mechanism is significantly smaller than 50000 , and that a speedup of order 10 is realistic .",
    "notice this would correspond to a typical scan length 10 times smaller than the maximal one ( 100 bp ) due to the current exchange mechanism ( @xmath36 is of the order 10 bp ) .",
    "in this paper we have considered some of the implications of a very interesting proposal for cooperation between repair enzymes in the localization of defects in single base pairs .",
    "first we have pointed out that the mechanism is likely to speedup the localization by a factor of order 10 compared with independent scanning by the repair enzymes . if an error is detected by the 30 muty enzymes in say 20 minutes ( it has to be considerably shorter than the replication time @xcite ) this corresponds to a reduction in scanning speed from 125 bp / sec to 13 bp / sec . for comparison ,",
    "the scan velocity for rna polymerase is 50 bp / sec , while for dna polymerase it is 1000 bp / sec .",
    "another in principle testable prediction is that upon over expression of all the repair enzymes with say a factor 4 the detection time is only decreased by a factor 2 ( both @xmath26 and @xmath4 are 4 times smaller ) , because information is not carried as efficiently along the dna any more .",
    "physiologically oxidative and radiative environments may result in an increased expression of repair enzymes @xcite , so the square root behavior and the coupling of the effectiveness of different kinds of repair enzymes is potentially of huge importance for the mutation rates in these kinds of stress full environments .",
    "summing up , only further experimentation can finally confirm this charge transport mechanism , while we here have demonstrated that the mechanism indeed offers a great benefit for the cell .",
    "in addition , the model is a nice toy model for protein cooperativity and one might wonder if the underlying principles behind could be of practical use in apparently unrelated engineering problems .",
