    "in this section we derive an analytical expression for the vector field in the close vicinity to the point singularity which allowed us to identify the role of dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction in its energetics .",
    "it is easy to show that the model hamiltonian eq . of the main text",
    "can be reduced in continuum approximation to the following functional @xcite : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a continuous unit vector field defined everywhere except at the singular points .",
    "@xmath19 and @xmath20 are micromagnetic constants for exchange and dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions , respectively , @xmath61 is the applied magnetic field , and @xmath21 is the magnetization of the material ( the total magnetic dipole moment per unit volume ) . for the case of a simple cubic lattice micromagnetic constants",
    "are related to the microscopic constants of the discrete model as @xmath62 where @xmath22 is the lattice constant , @xmath63 is the magnetic dipole moment of the magnetic atom .    in spherical coordinate parametrisation ,",
    "the components of the unit vector field are defined as    @xmath64 ,    where @xmath65 and @xmath66 .    to minimize the functional eq .",
    "one needs to solve corresponding euler - lagrange equations which in this case has a following form : @xmath67    let s assume that the singular point coincide with the origin of spherical coordinate system @xmath68 .",
    "then , in the close vicinity to this point , the taylor expansion of @xmath69 and @xmath70 reads @xmath71 in the assumption that magnetization distribution around the singular point has an axially symmetric structure , the first three terms in eqs.([eq : ser1 ] , [ eq : ser2 ] ) , which satisfy the eqs .",
    "( [ eq : el ] ) are @xmath72 and @xmath73 where @xmath46 and @xmath74 are arbitrary free constants , which are not defined by the asymptotic expansion but they can be determined numerically .",
    "note , the assumption of an axisymmetric structure , strictly speaking , is satisfied only at magnetic field above the saturation of the conical phase , @xmath75 .    using the eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ser1 ] - [ eq : ser_f ] ) we have got an expression for the energy contribution from the volume inside the sphere of radius @xmath76 surrounding the singularity : @xmath77 where @xmath78 in particular , for @xmath79 , the domain of definition for @xmath80 is @xmath81 , but the exact value can be derived only by numerical methods .",
    "here it is important to note , that the constants @xmath46 and @xmath74 , in fact , are strictly dependent on the ratio @xmath82 .    in the limiting case @xmath83 and @xmath84 , the expression in eq . shows a linear dependence on @xmath76 and converges to the energy dependence derived earlier for singularity in pure ferromagnets @xcite .",
    "thus , the energy contribution to the total energy related to the small volume around the singularity resulting from the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction is proportional to @xmath85 . from above one",

[ stereo ] . for the case of such constraint",
    "a few different minimization technique have been proposed @xcite . here",
    "we use nonlinear conjugate gradient ( ncg ) method with polak - ribire formula for updating of the conjugate direction . to conserve the constrain ( [ eq : con ] ) it",

    "[ stereo ] .",
    "such a stereographic projection is defined for each point on the sphere , except at the sphere s poles from which the points are projected onto the target plane .",
    "the projection of the point with @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) is not defined for the projection from the north pole ( from the south pole ) because @xmath97 .",
    "this is quite inconvenient for a computer implementation where the values of the variables are always restricted to a finite range .",
    "here we propose an alternative approach based on _ adaptive stereographic projections _ which allows to overcome the problem of the poles inertia @xcite .",
    "contrary to one pole stereographic projection , we consider both type of projections : from the north pole @xmath98 and from the south pole : @xmath99        corresponding coordinate homeomorphisms ( inverse formulas ) read : @xmath100 @xmath101    from the topology point of view , such a set of two coordinate charts is an atlas for @xmath88 . in our implementation of the ncg method , we allow an independent switching between the two types of projections for each spin , see supplementary movie 4 @xcite .",
    "in particular , for initial configuration we use north pole projection eqs .",
    "( [ eq : n_pro ] ) for points with initial value @xmath102 and south pole projection eqs .",

    "[ spheres]b . at some iteration one or",
    "few points may appear too far away from its initial semisphere , see fig .",
    "[ spheres]c .",
    "the criterion for that can be _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath104 , where @xmath105 is some arbitrary chosen value . in our implementation",
    "we choose it such that @xmath106 which corresponds to @xmath107 for the spins defined by the north pole and @xmath108 for south pole projection respectively .",
    "as soon as such event occurs at least for one spin , then all the points are switched to other set of variables in the same way as at initial step , see fig .",
    "[ spheres]d .",
    "thus some coordinates @xmath109 are changed into corresponding @xmath110 and vice versa : @xmath111 @xmath112 then the ncg starts again with the new set of stereographic coordinates @xmath93 , @xmath94 .",
    "note that during the minimization process such a global switching occures very seldom or never , it always depend on the initial configuration .        in order to distinguish @xmath109 from @xmath110 without introducing additional logical variable which define the type of corresponding projection for each spin e.g. @xmath113 ( true ) and @xmath114 ( false )",
    ", we used the following trick . in our stereographic projection scheme the center of the unit sphere",
    "is assumed to be located at some arbitrary position @xmath115 , @xmath116 such that @xmath117 and @xmath118 , @xmath119 .",
    "thereby , the sign of the variables @xmath93 , @xmath94 stored in the computer memory can be used as the indicator for the type of the projection , while in eqs.([eq : switchn],[eq : switchs ] ) the absolute values of the variables are used and a shift of the basis ( see @xmath120 in fig.[stereo ] ) has to be taken into account .",
    "such an adaptive stereographic projection scheme i ) allows one to obtain supreme performance of the ncg method , ii ) fully satisfies the constraint eq .",
    "( [ eq : con ] ) , and iii ) allows to avoid the problem with the inertia of the poles @xcite .",
    "contrary to other methods , see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite , another important advantage of our approach is the absence of any free scalar parameter which would require an additional strategy to replace this free parameter by the optimal value to archive the best performance .    the algorithm has been implemented in a nvidia cuda architecture for massive parallel calculations and real time visualization and has been used for the calculations on the graphic cards with microprocessors gk104 and gk110b . in order to achieve maximum performance we used single - precision floating - point format and implemented kahan summation and optimized parallel reduction algorithm @xcite in order to reduce numerical errors .    as initial conditions we used cone phase with vortex - like cylindrical inset : @xmath121 where @xmath122 , see also eq .",
    "in the main text . for the calculation of the chiral bobber with the ncg method ,",
    "the height of the cylinder has been restricted by @xmath123 , while the thickness @xmath124 of the simulated magnetic film has been varied in the range between @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "in order to identify the probability for spontaneous nucleation of the chiral bobber driven by ordinary thermal fluctuations we also perform simulated annealing @xcite with a monte carlo method .",
    "we implemented the classical metropolis algorithm @xcite . in the simulation of the annealing process",
    "we use an exponential rule for the temperature sequence : @xmath127 in the supplementary movie 3 @xcite we present real - time simulations of the annealing process , performed for the following set of parameters : @xmath40 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 and domain size of @xmath130 spins .",
    "detailed description of the movie is presented below .",
    "the simulation starts with a random spin distribution and an initial temperature of @xmath131 , above the curie temperature for the used set of system parameters .",
    "the temperature was gradually reduced down to @xmath132 and then the ncg minimizer has been used instead of the monte carlo iterations in order to complete the full relaxation process faster .",
    "it is done only for the reason of better visualization . performing the full relaxation with monte carlo",
    "requires much more iterations than the relaxation with ncg minimizer .    at @xmath133 on the top surface on the right hand side of the simulated domain one",
    "can already see a few bright spots corresponding to the nucleated chiral bobbers , which is illustrated by scanning through the thickness . after the full relaxation the spin structure shows the conical state with three chiral bobbers inside , two on the top and one on the bottom surface .",
    "finally we show iso - surfaces with @xmath134 , which illustrate the localization and the relative positions of the chiral bobbers .",
    "the number of monte carlo steps as well as the variation in the domain size and coupling constants obviously affects the probability for the chiral bobber nucleation .",
    "as far as we pursuit the purpose to find the regime for metastable state nucleation we used relatively fast cooling with a reduced number of monte carlo steps as compared to the slow cooling regime when the purpose is to find the ground state . with the set of parameters mentioned above we have found the optimal number of monte carlo steps to be 75 per spin at each temperature step which allows to observe the spontaneous nucleation of the chiral bobber with the relatively high probability",
    "however , even for this fast cooling regime the spontaneous nucleation of metastable skyrmion tube has not been observed in our simulations .",
    "in the calculation of the minimum energy path ( mep ) with the geodesic nudged elastic band ( gneb ) method we follow exactly the algorithm in ref .",
    "we started with the relaxed isolated skyrmion and the pure conical state which are used as initial and final configurations , respectively , for the desired discrete mep .",
    "we used a linear interpolation with small stochastic noise to set intermediate states and construct an initial path between the initial and final configurations .",
    "the typical number of intermediated states ( or images ) was set to 15 . instead of the velocity projection optimization on a sphere @xcite",
    "we used another method @xcite which we found to be more convenient for our implementation , but possibly less efficient .",
    "in particular , for each path optimization step of each spin at the lattice site @xmath5 of image @xmath135 , we solve the following partial differential equation @xmath136,\\ ] ] which is equivalent to the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation containing only the damping term , but with the recession term totally neglected .",
    "the @xmath137-dimensional vector @xmath138 ( @xmath113 is the number of spins ) in eq . controls the relaxation of each image towards the mep and is defined as @xmath139 where @xmath140 , @xmath141 , and @xmath142 are @xmath137-dimensional vectors of the effective field , the so - called spring force , and the normalized tangent vector laying in the tangent space of image @xmath135 , respectively .",
    "for detail see ref.@xcite . following the algorithm ref.@xcite we used path splitting between nearest metastable states and relaxed each of local minima independently . in fig.[mep - supl ] we present the same mep as in the main text together with exact view of the images corresponding to extrema on the mep .",
