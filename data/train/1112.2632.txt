    "in this paper , we report on an unexpected coincidence between two sets of integer lattice points that appear in the study of alternating links and their seifert surfaces .",
    "the first set derives from the first author s sutured floer homology theory @xcite . given a link @xmath4 with seifert surface @xmath1 , we can associate to it the sutured floer homology group @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the sutured manifold complementary to @xmath1 .",
    "this group decomposes as a direct sum over relative @xmath3 structures on @xmath7 namely , @xmath8 the set @xmath9 of relative @xmath3 structures can be thought of as an affine copy of @xmath10 .",

    "thus , in this case , @xmath16 is determined by @xmath17 .",
    "furthermore , we see that @xmath17 may be viewed as the euler characteristic ( function ) @xmath18 . indeed , up to an overall sign , @xmath19 agrees with the indicator function of @xmath17 .",

    "the second isomorphism means that the two sets are translates of each other in @xmath50 ; this is quoted from ( * ? ? ? * theorem 8.3 ) to show that it hardly matters whether we pick @xmath22 or @xmath21 to play the role of the vertices in our hypergraph .    both sets that appear in theorem [ thm : main ]",
    "can be viewed as multi - variable polynomials and have representations in determinant form .",
    "the theorem is proved by showing that a suitable sequence of elimination steps transforms the ` enhanced adjacency matrix ' of @xcite ( which is a large matrix with simple monomial entries ) into the turaev torsion ( a smaller matrix with entries obtained as fox derivatives ) that appears in @xcite .",
    "it would be very interesting to see if the relationship between the two matrices is a special case of some more general phenomenon .",
    "the statement of theorem [ thm : main ] may seem obscure , but in fact it has some far - reaching consequences .",
    "firstly , as @xmath51 is easy to compute , and since the support @xmath48 completely determines @xmath52 we obtain a simple algorithm for determining the @xmath30 of complements of seifert surfaces given by the median construction on a bipartite graph .",
    "( proposition [ pro : lengthen ] illustrates the usefulness of this approach . ) according to hirasawa ",

    ", we derive some previously unknown properties of the @xmath30 of standard seifert surfaces of homogeneous links .",
    "we say that @xmath66 is _ convex _ if @xmath67 is the intersection of @xmath68 with the convex hull ( in @xmath69 ) of @xmath70 .",
    "one of the first non - trivial facts about @xmath71 is that it is convex , see ( * ? ? ?",

    ", we obtain the following .",
    "[ cor : convex ] if @xmath1 is a standard seifert surface of a homogeneous link l , then @xmath17 is convex .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath1 is a seifert surface obtained by applying seifert s algorithm to a non - homogeneous link @xmath2 , the support @xmath17 need not be convex , even if the sutured floer homology is supported in a single @xmath13 grading .",
    "( for examples , see the computations for three - strand pretzel knots in the last section of @xcite . )",
    "an unpublished theorem of richard webb @xcite claims that all standard seifert surfaces @xmath1 of an alternating link have isomorphic @xmath17 .",
    "thus if @xmath2 is a special alternating link , @xmath16 , together with the @xmath3-grading , does not depend on the choice of minimal genus seifert surface @xmath1 . on the other hand",
    ", altman @xcite gives an example of a knot @xmath72 with distinct minimal genus seifert surfaces @xmath53 and @xmath54 for which @xmath73 is convex and @xmath74 is not .",
    "it would be interesting to know whether an alternating link can have non - standard seifert surfaces whose @xmath30 differs from that of the standard ones , or whether a homogeneous link can have a non - standard seifert surface @xmath1 so that @xmath17 is non - convex . apart from convexity , there is another important context into which theorem  [ thm : main ] fits .",
    "hypertrees were defined as part of a project aimed at finding spanning tree models of some orientation - sensitive link invariants , such as the homfly polynomial .",
    "namely , by counting hypertrees appropriately , from @xmath71 we may read off a one - variable polynomial invariant @xmath75 of the hypergraph @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "this so - called interior polynomial generalizes the partial evaluation @xmath76 of the tutte polynomial @xmath77 of ordinary graphs . then , extending a result of jaeger @xcite , the second author proposed the following .",
    "with notation as above , let @xmath78 denote the homfly polynomial of the link @xmath33 .",
    "then the part of @xmath79 which ( after substituting @xmath80 ) becomes the leading term in the alexander ",
    "conway polynomial @xmath81 is equal to @xmath82 .",
    "as @xmath22 and @xmath21 play symmetric roles for @xmath33 , this leads us to expect that @xmath83 .",
    "postnikov and the second author conjecture that this is indeed the case for any connected bipartite graph @xmath32 ; and furthermore , that the two polynomials also coincide with the so - called @xmath84-vector of some ( any ) triangulation of another polytope ( called root polytope ) derived from @xmath32 .",
    "then , it has already been proved  @xcite that this @xmath84-vector is equivalent to the relevant part of the homfly polynomial .",
    "therefore , the only missing step is purely discrete mathematical .",
    "now , if the conjecture holds true , then the part ( hereafter called the _ top _ ) of @xmath78 that realizes its maximum @xmath85-degree can be read off from either @xmath86 or @xmath87 . according to theorem [ thm : main ] , these are equivalent to @xmath88 and @xmath89 , respectively , where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are two plane bipartite graphs closely related to our original graph @xmath92 .",
    "the three graphs together form a structure called a trinity .",
    "see figure [ fig : links ] for an example .",
    "in other words , the conjecture implies that the top of @xmath79 can be computed from floer homology .",
    "the alert reader will notice that neither @xmath93 nor @xmath94 is a seifert surface for @xmath95 .",
    "it is also among our goals to derive the same homfly coefficients from @xmath96 .",
    "there are plenty of indications that this should be possible , including the following consequence of theorem [ thm : main ] and results in @xcite .",
    "[ cor : samesize ] with the plane bipartite graphs @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 and associated surfaces defined as above , we have @xmath100 for the corresponding supports .    this is true despite the fact that the three sets are the lattice points in three polytopes of different dimensions .",
    "corollary [ cor : samesize ] is inspired by , and can be viewed as an extension of , tutte s tree trinity theorem @xcite .",
    "it is also closely related to postnikov s duality result @xmath101 see @xcite .",
    "murasugi and przytycki @xcite showed that under ` star product ' of links , which is essentially murasugi sum , the top of the homfly polynomial behaves multiplicatively .",
    "thus , for any homogeneous link , the conjecture implies that coefficients along the top of the homfly polynomial can be derived from floer homology groups .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sections",
    "[ sec : hyp ] and [ sec : sfh ] we review the necessary results about hypergraphs and floer homology , respectively . theorem [ thm : main ] , along with some corollaries , is established in section [ sec : main ] .",

    "in @xcite , the second author developed a new theory of hypergraph invariants by generalizing the spanning tree polytope and ( partially ) the tutte polynomial to that context .",

    "* theorem 8.3 ) , it is established that the hypertree polytopes of planar dual hypergraphs are centrally symmetric .",
    "thus in any trinity , we have @xmath143 , @xmath144 , and @xmath145    notice that each triangle of a trinity is adjacent to exactly one edge and one point of each color .",
    "compared to the orientation of the sphere , the cyclic order of the colors around each triangle may be positive or negative .",
    "if two triangles share an edge , these orientations are opposite .",

    "figure [ fig : trinity ] . this coloring can be used to orient the dual graphs @xmath146 , @xmath147 , and @xmath148 ( dual in the classical , not in the hypergraph sense ) .",
    "namely , each edge in these graphs cuts through a black and a white triangle , and we orient it so that its tail end is in black territory .",
    "next , note that the sets of red edges , emerald edges , violet edges , white triangles , and black triangles all have the same cardinality @xmath149 .",
    "in particular , adjacency defines natural bijections between white triangles and edges of each color .",
    "if we apply euler s formula to the trinity , we get @xmath150 , i.e , @xmath151    let us distinguish one white triangle as the _",

    "we call these terms the _ tutte matchings _ of the trinity .",
    "a tutte matching is indeed a complete matching of non - root points to adjacent non - outer white triangles .",
    "equivalently , it can be thought of as a collection of edges from @xmath146 , @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "namely , whenever a triangle and a point are matched , we choose the dual edge that cuts through the triangle and ends at the point .",
    "it turns out that such a collection is the union of three so called spanning arborescences of @xmath146 , @xmath147 and @xmath148 , respectively , rooted at the respective points adjacent to @xmath132 .",

    "the signs of all expansion terms in the determinant are still positive , but this is not just by coincidence any more , rather by design . note how the bottom right @xmath340 submatrix is already upper triangular at the start .    in each of the seven steps below , we use the encircled pivot to clear out non - zero entries to its left .",
    "each column of the top left @xmath341 block that remains at the end is equal to a monomial times the corresponding column of the determinant .",
