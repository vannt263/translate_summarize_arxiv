    "physical layer security for wireless communications is of growing importance since it can guarantee the information secrecy regardless of an eavesdropper s computational capability and it eliminates the key distribution and management required by traditional cryptographic techniques @xcite . in the pioneering studies @xcite , a wiretap channel was proposed as the fundamental model to characterize physical layer security . in the wiretap channel , an eavesdropper ( eve )",
    "attempts to intercept the communication between a transmitter ( alice ) and an intended receiver ( bob ) .",
    "the prerequisite to achieve physical layer security is that the capacity of the channel between alice and bob ( henceforth referred to as the main channel ) is larger than the capacity of the channel between alice and eve ( henceforth referred to as the eavesdropper s channel ) .    from the perspective of wiretap code design",
    ", the knowledge of the capacities of the main channel and the eavesdropper s channel is required at alice in order to guarantee perfect secrecy @xcite .",
    "in fact , perfect secrecy has two requirements : ( i ) the error probability at bob decreases with increasing code length , and ( ii ) the fraction of information leakage to eve decreases with increasing code length .",
    "these two requirements are denoted as the reliability constraint and the secrecy constraint , respectively @xcite .",
    "a wiretap code can be designed by choosing two code rates , namely , the codeword rate , @xmath0 , and the rate of transmitted confidential information ( or equivalently , the target secrecy rate ) , @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the redundancy rate , @xmath2 , is used to confuse eve . in order to guarantee the reliability constraint of wiretap channels ,",
    "the rate of transmitted codewords has to be chosen as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the capacity of the main channel . in order to guarantee the secrecy constraint of wiretap channels , the redundancy rate has to be chosen as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the capacity of the eavesdropper s channel .",
    "if the values of both @xmath4 and @xmath6 are available at alice , the maximum target secrecy rate is achievable , which is referred to as the secrecy capacity of a wiretap channel and is given by @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "however , the assumption that @xmath6 is available at alice is too strong since in practice eve may not feed back her channel state information ( csi ) to alice .",
    "in addition , in practice alice may not know @xmath4 since bob may not feed back @xmath4 to alice due to the limited feedback overhead supported by the main channel from bob to alice depends on the quantization accuracy of @xmath4 . ] .",
    "we note that it is impossible for alice to guarantee @xmath5 and fulfill the secrecy constraint in the case where only the statistical knowledge of the eavesdropper s channel is available at alice . in this case",
    ", the performance of wiretap channels has been characterized in terms of the ergodic secrecy capacity @xcite , and in terms of the existing secrecy outage probability , i.e. , @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "it is important to point out that the ergodic secrecy capacity is an average performance metric , and thus can not be utilized to set @xmath0 or @xmath9 .",
    "the use of the existing secrecy outage probability in determining @xmath0 or @xmath9 has the drawback that it does not separate the quality of service ( reliability requirements ) from the secrecy requirements .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a new framework to determine the wiretap code rates when the capacity of the eavesdropper s channel is not available at alice .",
    "our framework is based on a new metric , referred to as the _ effective secrecy throughput _ ( est ) , which explicitly captures both the reliability constraint and the secrecy constraint of wiretap channels .",
    "the est measures the average rate of the confidential information transmitted from alice to bob without being eavesdropped on . as we will discuss in more details later ,",
    "the key attribute of our new metric is that it encapsulates the main features of the wiretap channel , yet can be applied to a variety of transmission schemes .",
    "in our proposed framework we provide easy - to - implement methods to determine the wiretap code rates that achieve the locally maximum est for two system models .",
    "the first model is a high complexity system where bob feeds back the capacity of the main channel to alice .",
    "we refer to the transmission scheme under this system model as the adaptive transmission scheme since bob adaptively adjusts his wiretap code rates according to @xmath4 .",
    "the second model is a low complexity system where bob does not feed back the capacity of the main channel to alice .",
    "we refer to the transmission scheme under this system model as the fixed - rate transmission scheme since bob has to fix his wiretap code rates when @xmath4 and @xmath6 are unavailable .    in the above two models , we assume that the average signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of the eavesdropper s channel is available at alice . in order to relax this assumption , we consider an absolute - passive eavesdropping scenario where the average snr of the eavesdropper s channel is unavailable at alice .",
    "for this latter scenario , we derive closed - form expressions for the average est of the adaptive and the fixed - rate transmission schemes , based on which the wiretap code rates of these two schemes can be determined .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ system_model ] details the system model and the proposed new framework for determining the wiretap code rates . in section [ known_cb ] ,",
    "the determination of the redundancy rate @xmath9 for the adaptive transmission scheme is presented .",
    "section [ unknown_cb ] presents the determination of @xmath10 for the fixed - rate transmission scheme . in section [ unknown_gamma_e ] ,",
    "we extend the determination of the wiretap code rates into an absolute - passive eavesdropping scenario based on a proposed annulus threat model .",
    "numerical results are provided in section [ known_cb ] , section [ unknown_cb ] , and section [ unknown_gamma_e ] in order to verify our analysis and provide useful insights into our solutions .",

    "in this section , we detail our system model and the new framework for determining wiretap code rates ( @xmath0 and @xmath9 ) using the proposed est .      the wiretap channel of interest is where the transmitter ( alice ) and the intended receiver ( bob ) are equipped with a single antenna each , and the eavesdropper ( eve ) is equipped with @xmath16 antennas .",
    "this wiretap channel is referred to as the single - input single - output multi - antenna eavesdropper ( sisome ) wiretap channel .",
    "we note that the deployment of multiple antennas at the eavesdropper is more conservative ( from a security viewpoint ) than the deployment of a single antenna at the eavesdropper .",
    "this is due to the fact that the transmitter can not fully control the number of antennas at eve .",
    "we assume that the main channel and the eavesdropper s channel are subject to independent quasi - static rayleigh fading with equal block length .",
    "we also assume that bob possesses the full knowledge of the instantaneous csi of the main channel , but alice only knows the average snr of the main channel .",
    "we further assume that eve knows the instantaneous csi of the eavesdropper s channel .",
    "as such , eve applies maximum ratio combining ( mrc ) @xcite to combine the received signals in order to exploit the @xmath17-antenna diversity and maximize the probability of successful eavesdropping .",
    "this is due to the fact that when alice transmits a single data stream , the maximum output snr of the eavesdropper s channel is achieved at eve if eve adopts mrc . in our system model , alice and bob are equipped with a single antenna each and therefore alice transmits a single data stream to bob .",
    "the received signal at bob is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the complex coefficient of the main channel with rayleigh fading , @xmath20 is the transmit signal , and @xmath21 is the gaussian noise of the main channel with zero mean and variance @xmath22 .",
    "the transmit power constraint is given by @xmath23 = p_a$ ] , where @xmath24 is the total transmit power .",

    ", alice intends to sent the confidential information to bob with a high transmission rate while guaranteeing both the reliability constraint and secrecy constraint .",
    "however , if the capacity of the eavesdropper s channel is not available at alice , the secrecy constraint can not be guaranteed and a secrecy outage may occur .",
    "we define the secrecy outage probability as @xmath37 we note that @xmath38 is different from the existing secrecy outage probability , @xmath8 , since the latter includes not only the secrecy outage probability but also the reliability outage probability . as such , it is not exactly precise to name @xmath39 as the secrecy outage probability .    likewise , if the capacity of the main channel is not available at alice , the reliability constraint can not be guaranteed and thus a reliability outage may occur .",
    "we define the reliability outage probability as @xmath40 based on , we can see that the reliability constraint can be guaranteed if @xmath4 is available at alice .    incorporating both the secrecy outage probability and reliability outage probability , we present the est in the following definition .    _",
    "the est ( bit / channel ) of a wiretap channel is defined as _",
    "@xmath41 \\left[1\\!-\\!\\mathcal{o}_{s}(r_e)\\right].\\ ] ]    in order to explicitly explain the physical meaning of the est of a wiretap channel , we present a schematic of secure transmissions within multiple fading blocks in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] . in",
    ", @xmath42 quantifies the rate of transmitted confidential information @xmath43 ( represented by a blue block at alice in fig .  [",
    "fig : schematic ] ) , while @xmath44\\left[1-\\mathcal{o}_{s}\\left(r_{e}\\right)\\right]$ ] quantifies the probability that the information is securely transmitted from alice to bob . in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] , the reliability outage probability corresponds to the probability that bob receives a yellow block , and the secrecy outage probability corresponds to the probability that bob receives a red block .",
    "therefore , the est quantifies the average _ secrecy _ rate at which the messages are transmitted from alice to bob without being leaked to eve ( i.e. , the est quantifies the average number of the blue blocks achieved at bob over a large number of fading realizations ) .",
    "accordingly , the est tells us the average rate of messages that can be securely transmitted . in the following sections , we determine values of the wiretap code rates ( i.e. , @xmath0 , @xmath9 ) for the adaptive and fixed - rate transmission schemes .",
    "knowing the average rate of confidential messages is of practical significance for the passive eavesdropping scenario , since it indicates to us how much secure data can be transmitted on average over a given period of time in a wiretap channel .",
    "we note that we can not identify which message is secure and which is not .",
    "we would clarify that this is not due to the use of the est , but is due to the adopted eavesdropping scenario . in our adopted scenario",
    "the instantaneous channel knowledge of eve is not available at alice , which leads to the fact that it is impossible to guarantee perfect secure transmission between alice and bob ( i.e. , secrecy outage possibly occurs ) . due to this",
    ", previous studies adopted the secrecy outage probability ( e.g. , @xcite ) and/or the throughput ( e.g. , @xcite ) as the performance metrics .",
    "we note that the average rate of confidential messages can not be readily evaluated by either the secrecy outage probability or the throughput . as such , the est is more informative and is of more practical operational significance to bob in some circumstances .",
    "for example , bob may maximize the est without any bound on the secrecy outage probability or the throughput .",
    "we note here the work of @xcite focussed on an on - off transmission scheme for the wiretap channel and introduced a new metric that is motivated by a desire to disentangle reliability and secrecy features .",
    "the approach used in @xcite is based on a new secrecy outage probability defined through a _",
    "conditional _ probability .",
    "this is quite different from the approach adopted here where we directly maximize a key throughput rate of the wiretap channel - the est .",
    "importantly , our technique does not target any transmission scheme in particular and therefore is directly applicable to a wide range of schemes and system models .",
