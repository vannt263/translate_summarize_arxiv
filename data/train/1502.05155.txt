    "itinerant ferromagnetic ( fm ) compounds have attracted much attention because some of them , for example , mnsi @xcite , zrzn@xmath8 @xcite , and uge@xmath8 @xcite , exhibit a similar three dimensional ( 3d ) [ temperature ( @xmath9 ) - magnetic field ( @xmath10 ) - pressure ( @xmath11 ) ] phase diagram as schematically depicted in fig.[fig1_3dphasediagram ] . in this phase diagram ,",
    "the fm transition temperature is suppressed by applying pressure and changes from the second - order to the first - order transition at a tricritical point ( tcp ) and reaches a quantum transition point ( qtp ) at zero temperature .",

    "et al_. @xcite .",

    "<S> in order to investigate physical properties around a ferromagnetic ( fm ) quantum transition point and a tricritical point ( tcp ) in the itinerant - electron metamagnetic compound ucoal , we have performed the @xmath0co nuclear quadrupole resonance ( nqr ) measurement for the fe - substituted u(co@xmath1fe@xmath2)al ( @xmath3 = 0 , 0.5 , 1 , and 2% ) in zero external magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the fe concentration dependence of @xmath0co - nqr spectra at low temperatures indicates that the first - order fm transition occurs at least above @xmath3 = 1% . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic fluctuations along the @xmath4 axis detected by the nuclear spin - spin relaxation rate @xmath5 exhibit an anomaly at @xmath6 @xmath7 20 k and enhance with increasing @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> these results are in good agreement with theoretical predictions and indicate the presence of prominent critical fluctuations at the tcp in this system . </S>"
