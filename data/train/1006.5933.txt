    "quaternary intermetallic nickel borocarbides ( hereafter borocarbides ) of the @xmath9ni@xmath1b@xmath1c type ( @xmath9 is a rare - earth element ) attract special interest ( see surveys @xcite and further references ) as they include compounds with rather high superconducting transition temperatures ( up to t@xmath217  k , @xmath9=lu ) and compounds with different types of magnetic ordering that include states with commensurate and incommensurate spin - density waves .",
    "borocarbides have a body centered tetragonal crystalline structure with the ratio c / a@xmath53 @xcite .",
    "they have a rather complex fermi surface ( fs ) consisting of several sheets @xcite .",
    "fs is anisotropic @xcite and has two characteristic groups of electrons possessing different fermi velocities @xmath10 ( this was mentioned in @xcite from the de haas - van alphen experiments @xcite .",
    "the t@xmath11 of borocarbides is determined not by the total density of states @xmath12 , but by the contribution to the density of states which is made by the slow electrons of the nodal regions @xcite . in the normal state",
    "the transport properties of borocarbides , in particular their resistivity _",
    "@xmath13 _ , are practically isotropic @xcite because they are related to the groups of electrons that have relatively high velocities @xmath10 with lower anisotropy and are unrelated to the nodal points at the fermi surface @xcite .",
    "in @xmath9ni@xmath1b@xmath1c ( @xmath9=dy , ho , er , tm ) compounds the element @xmath9 contains 4f - electrons with partially filled f - shells having a magnetic moment . as a result ,",
    "t@xmath14 of these compounds is appreciably lower in comparison with nonmagnetic borocarbides ( @xmath9=y , lu @xcite ) .",
    "the object of this study , erni@xmath1b@xmath1c , undergoes a superconducting transition at t@xmath1511  k @xcite and two magnetic transitions below t@xmath14 , which do not destroy superconductivity .",
    "the afm ordering occurs at the neel temperature t@xmath166  k when the er ions form a transverse - polarized incommensurate spin - density wave state @xcite .",
    "the afm ordering entails structural distortions and thus reduces the crystal symmetry from tetragonal to orthorhombic @xcite .",
    "this magneto - elastic effect is regarded as a structural jahn - teller transition @xcite .",
    "the modulation wave vector of the spin - density waves is practically independent of temperature and is along the @xmath17-axis ( direction [ 100 ] ) , or the equivalent @xmath18-axis ( direction [ 010 ] ) , the spins being aligned along the @xmath18-axis or the @xmath17-axis , respectively . as the temperature lowers further , the compound changes into a weakly ferromagnetic state with t@xmath192.3  k in which a spontaneous vortex lattice is formed @xcite .    to understand the features of the superconducting state in magnetic borocarbides , it is essential to have information about the superconducting gap @xmath3 ( magnitude , behavior , anisotropy , etc . ) or the superconducting order parameter ( op ) .",
    "the investigations of the gap @xmath3 in erni@xmath1b@xmath1c @xcite give @xmath20  mev .",
    "its temperature dependence corresponds on the whole to the bcs theory .",
    "it is noted @xcite that on a paramagnetic ",
    "afm transition @xmath3 decreases and the pair - breaking parameter @xmath21 @xcite reaches a maximum in the transition region . the authors @xcite interpreted the results using the theory @xcite which predicts a decrease in @xmath3 due to spin - density wave gaps that open in some parts of the fs . on the other hand ,",
    "the influence of the afm transition on @xmath3 was not observed in subsequent tunnel measurements on erni@xmath1b@xmath1c @xcite .",
    "detailed point - contact ( pc ) spectra of the andreev reflection in erni@xmath1b@xmath1c in two principal crystallographic directions have been obtained in our recent study @xcite .",
    "the analysis of these spectra shows that :    1 .",
    "they are essentially anisotropic and their behavior differs qualitatively from that in luni@xmath1b@xmath1c ; 2 .   the afm ordering lowered the gap ; 3",
    ".   the two - gap model can be efficient at describing the experimental results .",
    "however , the large ( six ) number of fitting parameters involved in the two - gap model casts some doubt on the uniqueness of results .",
    "on the other hand , it is quite appropriate to determine to what extent the one - gap approximation can account for the nontrivial behavior of the superconducting op ( gap ) @xcite . in this study",
    "we have also analyzed the one- and two - gap approximation within the beloborodko ( bb ) model @xcite allowing for the pair - breaking influence of magnetic ions and on the basis of the generalized blonder - tinkham - klapwijk ( gbtk ) model @xcite allowing for the dynes pair - breaking parameter @xcite .",
    "here we detail the experimental technique , which was described in @xcite only briefly because of the space limitations .",
    "the pc measurements were made on erni@xmath1b@xmath1c single crystals ( t@xmath211  k ) grown from the melt ( ames laboratory , prof .",
    "p. canfield s group ) and were similar to those used in @xcite .",
    "the crystals were thin ( @xmath22  mm ) plates with the @xmath6-axis normal to the plane of the plate .",
    "the surface pretreatment was similar to that for luni@xmath1b@xmath1c @xcite ( either by etching in a 5% nitric acid - alcohol solution or by of cleavage ) .",
    "the other electrode was a high - purity ag rod or ag wire of 0.15  mm in diameter . in the latter case",
    "the wire surface was pre - washed in concentrated nitric acid .",
    "the contact was made between the pretreated single crystal surface and the loop - shaped wire . the use of the wire loop as a damper improved the mechanical stability of the contacts and made it possible to measure the characteristics of one of the contacts ( in the @xmath8-plane ) both on heating from 1.45  k to @xmath2311  k ( normal state ) and on subsequent cooling from the normal sate to the starting lowest temperature .",
    "the temperature measurements were made using a continuous flow he cryostat ( its analog is described in @xcite ) .",
    "an insert was placed inside the cryostat , which made a pc by touching the sample surface with the silver electrode at helium temperature . the typical pc resistance varied from several to tens of ohms . for more elaborate investigations ,",
    "the pcs were selected , which had the highest possible `` tunneling '' characteristics seen as an intensive maximum in the @xmath24 curve at @xmath25 and the strongest nonlinearity corresponding to at least a 10% change in @xmath24 in the interval @xmath268  mv . on some contacts",
    "the @xmath24 spectra were measured in the interval from t@xmath27=1.45  k to temperatures @xmath28  k higher than t@xmath2911  k. the results were quite reproducible irrespective of the resistance of a particular contact .",
    "therefore , here we analyze the measurements on two contacts along the principal crystallographic directions along the @xmath6-axis and in the @xmath8-plane .",
    "the detailed series of the @xmath24 spectra were obtained at approximately equal temperature intervals .",
    "30 curves were taken at rising temperature and 34 curves were measured at lowering temperature in the @xmath8-plane , while 49 curves were measured in the @xmath6-direction at rising temperature .",
    "the contacts remained stable during the whole period of measurement .",

    "only a few of the curves are shown , width=302 ]    parameters characterizing the contacts and erni@xmath1b@xmath1c are described in @xcite .",
    "the most important of them is the pc size ( diameter ) estimated as @xmath319.1  nm , @xmath324.4  nm for the corresponding directions ( fig.[fig1 ] ) . the coherence length @xmath33 in this compound increases from 15 to @xmath523  nm @xcite when @xmath34 increases from 3  k to 8  k , which satisfies the requirement @xmath35 for the theory @xcite .",

    "there is no reason to expect that the interminima half - distance would coincide with the op averaged over the fermi surface .",
    "therefore , it is expedient to calculate the temperature dependence of the averaged op from the fitting results for the theoretical and experimental curves . ]",
    "it should be noted that in the erni@xmath1b@xmath30ag pc the two - minima structure of the @xmath0 curve persists up to t@xmath14 in the @xmath8-plane and 0.95  t@xmath14 in the @xmath6-direction .",
    "this is typical of tunnel contacts ( e.g. , @xcite ) and rather unusual in pcs , where the andreev reflection is important and the tunnel parameter is @xmath491(0.8 ) .",
    "besides , there is another feature in the erni@xmath1b@xmath1c spectra that is unobservable in luni@xmath1b@xmath1c : the distance between the minima in the @xmath0 curve increases with temperature up to a maximum slightly above the temperature of the afm transition .",
    "it is reasonable to attribute this behavior to the magnetic transition in erni@xmath1b@xmath1c .",
    "such transitions are absent in luni@xmath1b@xmath1c .",
    "it is also important that the local critical temperature in the investigated pcs ( at which the main minimum disappears from the @xmath0 curve ) practically coincides with t@xmath14 of the crystal , which suggests that the properties of the material remain unaltered in the contact .",
    "as is mentioned in the introduction , experimental data were analyzed in the one- and two gap approximations using two models :    1 .",

    "the bb model @xcite which introduces the pair - breaking parameter @xmath50 to account for the finite lifetime of cooper pairs due to the pair - breaking action of ( disordered ) magnetic moments ( in our case the er ions possessing a magnetic moment )",
    ".    the terms `` energy gap '' ( gbtk model @xcite ) and `` order parameter '' @xcite used in this model are of equivalent physical sense ( see the detailed discussion in @xcite , p.014512 - 3 and are therefore denoted identically with @xmath3 .",
    "this , however , does not refer to the term `` energy gap @xmath51 '' in the bb model @xcite which differentiates the superconducting order parameter @xmath3 and the energy gap @xmath52 @xcite .",

    "the calculation technique of the most popular gbtk model minimizing the r.m.s . deviations @xmath57 between the shapes of experimental curves ( see @xcite , fig.3 ) faces a certain problem : when the magnitudes of @xmath21 and the gap @xmath3 become comparable , the error curve for @xmath3 has no distinct minimum , which is most typical of the @xmath6-direction ( see appendix , fig.18 ) .    note that in this comparison of the theoretical and experimental curves the parameter @xmath57 characterizes only the degree of their discrepancy in shape , while the distinctions in intensity are compensated using a scaling factor @xmath58 .",

    "note a distinct peak at t@xmath68 in the dependence h@xmath73(t ) in the field along the @xmath6-direction ( fig.2 in @xcite ) , which indicates indirectly that the afm transition reduces the superconducting gap .     and pair - breaking parameters @xmath76 reduced to the same units for the erni@xmath1b@xmath1c - ag pc in the @xmath8-plane and the @xmath6-direction .",

    "2 .   the intensity of the pc spectra @xmath24 changes in correlation with the gap : the intensity decreases monotonically in the @xmath8-plane and has an extremum near the afm transition in the @xmath6-direction . this behavior may be due to the orientation - dependent pair - breaking effect of spin - density waves .",

    "3 .   as in @xcite ,",
    "the pair - breaking parameter @xmath50 increases in the vicinity of magnetic transitions , which is natural to attribute to the effect of spin fluctuations under a change of the magnetic order .",

    "@xmath1181 happens very often too .",
    "the reasons may be as follows .    1 .",
    "the electron transport through a pc deviates from the ballistic conditions @xcite .",
    "an inhomogeneity at which the pc region at the s - electrode side is not fully superconducting because of the normal region ( regions ) near the @xmath80 boundary in the superconductor .",
    "3 .   a superconducting gap can occur only in a part of the fs .",
    "for example , the afm molecular field induces a gap in some fs parts in erni@xmath1b@xmath1c and suppresses the superconducting gap in these regions .     of the shape of the theoretical curve from experimental @xmath3 at 7k in the @xmath6-direction .",

    "this can be used as a criterion of validity for a model . as an example",

    "the gap is distributed in the interval 1 - 3.35mev ( insert ) .",

    "thus , the one - gap gbtk calculation results in the highest value in the @xmath43 estimate .",

    "note that in the bb model a departure from the best - chosen @xmath43-value caused a sharp increase in the error @xmath57 , and therefore the limits of @xmath43 variation are rather narrow .",
    "on the other hand , the gbtk model @xcite allows more freedom of selecting @xmath43 , especially in the @xmath6-direction . however , this variation has practically no effect on the shape of temperature dependence @xmath132 because the curves @xmath133 are nearly parallel at both temperatures .",
    "the gap can be estimated readily at another @xmath43 value using the dependence @xmath133 .      unlike the gbtk model , the lowest - error curves obtained in the bb model have distinct minima ( fig.[fig19 ] ) . using a fixed @xmath43 impairs considerably the quality of fitting in this approximation .",
    "the results of the one - gap calculation allowing for the minima in the curves are illustrated in fig.[fig9 ] and the dependencies @xmath135 are shown in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "the decrease in the @xmath43-value is due to the two - gap character of superconductivity in this compound , which determines different op magnitudes and a different ( in comparison to the gbtk result ) shape of the density of states .",
    "the relative share of the fs with a larger op decreases at rising temperature ( see the two - gap bb calculation section ) .",
    "used in bb theory the density of states terminates abruptly at the gap edge . in the one - gap approximation of the experimental curve",
    "this entails termination of the contribution to conductivity from the fs parts with smaller ops",
    ". however , since the spectrum intensity is estimated assuming that the op obtained is related to the whole fermi surface , @xmath43 decreases .",
    "the difference between the dependencies @xmath135 in the @xmath6-direction and the @xmath8-plane can be attribute to the anisotropic effect of spin - density waves ( see the above interpretation of the quantity @xmath67 and fig.[fig3 ] ) .",
    "the temperature - dependent afm molecular field induces a gap in some parts of fs in the @xmath6-direction and destroys the superconducting gap in them .",
    "an afm gap is more probable in the fs parts which have a smaller superconducting gap taking into account the temperature dependence of the op in the corresponding temperature region .",
    "the sharp decrease in the op on approaching t@xmath14 can also be caused by the two - band structure of the fs and the reduction of the fs share with a larger op .",
    "there may exist a certain minimal fs share with a large op below which superconductivity is destroyed rapidly due to the interband interaction . in our case",
    "the departure from the bcs - dependence started in both directions at @xmath8110k at which the contribution of the larger op to conductivity dropped below 20% ( two - gap calculation ) .      as noted in the introduction , in the general case the two - gap calculation by eq.([eq2 ] ) involves seven fitting parameters ( @xmath97 , @xmath96 , @xmath95 , @xmath94 , z , s and @xmath136 .",
    "this has an unfavorable effect on the estimates obtained .",
    "it is therefore desirable to minimize the number of such parameters on the basis of physically reasonable limitations . in the strict sense ,",
    "the scaling factor @xmath43 is not a fitting parameter",
    ". it does not enter into the theoretical formulas describing current - voltage characteristics .",
    "it is intended to equalize the intensities of experimental and theoretical curves on calculating the mutual r.m.s .",
    "deviation of their shapes .",
    "however , a use of @xmath43=_const _ restricts the range of permissible values for the rest of the fitting parameters .",
    "a fixed @xmath43 reduces the number of fitting parameters at least by one parameter ( fig.[fig18 ] ) .",
    "we did not fix the tunnel parameter @xmath79 which was found to be approximately constant except near t@xmath14 . as a result , we have four fitting parameters instead of seven . besides , it is reasonable to fix the relative contribution @xmath85 to conductivity from each band .",
    "thus , the calculation was made using fixed @xmath43=0.35 in the @xmath8-plane and @xmath43=0.5 in the @xmath6-direction .",
    "the relative contribution of the smaller gap to conductivity was @xmath85=0.8 in both directions .",
    "fixed @xmath85 actually couples @xmath3 and @xmath114 , which can distort their temperature dependencies . indeed ,",
    "if , for example , the first gap remains constant and the second one decreases , the relative contribution of the first gap increases ( it is assumed that the fs share of each gap does not change ) . to exclude this , it is necessary to decrease the broadening parameter of the second gap or to increase it for the first one .",
    "identical temperature dependencies for gaps and broadening parameters is the simplest version free of distortions .",
    "after the paper was sent to arxiv , we were aware about recent three - dimensional study of the fermi surface of luni@xmath1b@xmath1c in @xcite .",
    "this study shows that 1 ) the fermi surface topology of the rare - earth nickel borocarbides varies little for rare - earth elements such as er , tm and yb , 2 ) there are 3 bands which contribution to the density - of - states ( dos ) at the fermi energy is 0.24% , 22.64% and 77.1% .",
