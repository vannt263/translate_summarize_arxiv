    "we are interested in designing lie group numerical schemes for the strong approximation of nonlinear stratonovich stochastic differential equations of the form @xmath0 here @xmath1 are @xmath2 independent scalar wiener processes and @xmath3 .",

    "the flow - map @xmath12 of the integral equation   is defined as the map taking the initial data @xmath13 to the solution @xmath14 at time  @xmath15 , i.e.  @xmath16 .",

    "suppose we know that the exact solution of a given system of stochastic differential equations evolves on a smooth manifold @xmath17 ( see malliavin  @xcite or emery  @xcite ) , but we can only find the solution pathwise numerically .",
    "how can we ensure that our approximate numerical solution also lies in the manifold ?",
    "suppose we are given a finite dimensional lie group @xmath18 and lie group action @xmath19 that generates transport across the manifold @xmath17 from the starting point @xmath20 via elements of @xmath18 . then with any given elements @xmath21 in the lie algebra @xmath22 corresponding to the lie group @xmath18 , we can associate the infinitesimal action @xmath23 using the lie group action @xmath19 .",
    "the map @xmath24 is a lie algebra homomorphism from @xmath22 to @xmath25 , the lie algebra of vector fields over the manifold @xmath17 .",
    "further the lie subalgebra @xmath26 is isomorphic to a finite dimensional lie algebra with the same structure constants ( see olver  @xcite , p.  56 ) .",
    "conversely , suppose we know that the lie algebra generated by the set of governing vector fields @xmath27 , @xmath10 , on @xmath17 is finite dimensional , call this @xmath28 .",
    "then we know there exists a finite dimensional lie group @xmath18 whose lie algebra @xmath22 has the same structure constants as @xmath28 relative to some basis , and there is a lie group action @xmath19 such that @xmath29 , @xmath10 , for some @xmath30 ( see olver  @xcite , p.  56 or",
    "kunita  @xcite , p.  194 ) .",
    "the choice of group and action is not unique .    in this paper",
    "we assume that there is a finite dimensional lie group @xmath18 and action @xmath19 such that our set of governing vector fields @xmath27 , @xmath10 , are each infinitesimal lie group actions generated by some element in @xmath22 via @xmath19 , i.e.  @xmath29 for some @xmath30 , @xmath10 .",
    "they are said to be fundamental vector fields .",
    "this means that we can write down the set of governing vector fields @xmath31 for a system of stochastic differential equations on the lie group @xmath18 that , via the lie group action @xmath19 , generates the flow governed by the set of vector fields @xmath27 on the manifold .",
    "the vector fields @xmath27 on @xmath17 are simply the push forward of the vector fields @xmath31 on @xmath18 via the lie group action @xmath19 .",
    "typically the flow on the lie group also needs to be computed numerically .",
    "we thus want the approximation to remain in the lie group so that the lie group action takes us back to the manifold .    to achieve this ,",
    "we pull back the set of governing vector fields @xmath31 on @xmath18 to the set of governing vector fields @xmath32 on @xmath22 , via the exponential map ` @xmath33 ' from @xmath22 to @xmath18 .",
    "thus the stochastic flow generated on @xmath22 by the vector fields @xmath32 generates the stochastic flow on @xmath18 generated by the @xmath31 .",
    "the set of governing vector fields on @xmath22 are for each @xmath34 : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the @xmath37th bernoulli number and the adjoint operator @xmath38 is a closed operator on @xmath22 , in fact @xmath39 $ ] , the lie bracket on @xmath22 .",
    "now the essential point is that @xmath30 and so the series on the right or any truncation of it is closed in @xmath22 .",
    "hence if we construct an approximation to our stochastic differential equation on @xmath22 using the vector fields @xmath32 or an approximation of them achieved by truncating the series representation , then that approximation must reside in the lie algebra @xmath22 .",
    "we can then push the approximation in the lie algebra forward onto the lie group and then onto the manifold .",
    "provided we compute the exponential map and action appropriately , our approximate solution lies in the manifold ( to within machine accuracy ) . in summary , for a given @xmath40 and any @xmath20 we have the following commutative diagram : @xmath41    we have implicitly separated the governing set of vector fields @xmath27 , @xmath10 , from the driving path process @xmath42 .",
    "together they generate the unique solution process @xmath43 to the stochastic differential equation  . when there is only one driving wiener process ( @xmath44 ) the it map @xmath45 is continuous in the topology of uniform convergence . when there are two or more driving processes ( @xmath46 ) the universal limit theorem tells us that the it map @xmath45 is continuous in the @xmath47-variation topology , in particular for @xmath48 ( see lyons  @xcite , lyons and qian  @xcite and malliavin  @xcite ) .",
    "a wiener path with @xmath46 has finite @xmath47-variation for @xmath49 .",
    "this means that from a pathwise perspective , approximations to @xmath4 constructed using successively refined approximations to @xmath50 are only guaranteed to converge to the correct solution @xmath4 , if we include information about the lvy chordal areas of the driving path process .",
    "note however that the @xmath51-norm of the @xmath52-variation of a wiener process is finite . in the lie group integration procedure prescribed above",
    "we must solve a stochastic differential system on the lie algebra @xmath22 defined by the set of governing vector fields @xmath32 and the driving path process @xmath42 . in light of the universal limit theorem and with stepsize adaptivity in mind in future ( see gaines and lyons  @xcite ) , we for instance use in our examples order  @xmath53 stochastic numerical methods  that include the lvy chordal area  to solve for the flow on the lie algebra @xmath22 .",
    "we have thus explained the idea behind munthe - kaas methods and how they can be generalized to the stochastic setting .",
    "the first half of this paper formalizes this procedure .",
    "in the second half of this paper , we consider autonomous vector fields and construct stochastic lie group integration schemes using castell  gaines methods .",
    "this approach proceeds as follows .",
    "we truncate the stochastic exponential lie series expansion corresponding to the flow @xmath54 of the solution process @xmath4 to the stochastic differential equation  . we then approximate the driving path process @xmath42 by replacing it by a suitable nearby piecewise smooth path in the appropriate variation topology .",
    "an approximation to the solution @xmath14 requires the exponentiation of the approximate truncated exponential lie series .",
    "this can be achieved by solving the system of ordinary differential equations driven by the vector field that is the approximate truncated exponential lie series .",
    "if we use ordinary munthe - kaas methods as the underlying ordinary differential integrator the castell  gaines method becomes a stochastic lie group integrator .",
    "further , based on the castell  gaines approach we then present _ uniformly accurate exponential lie series integrators _ that are globally more accurate than their stochastic taylor counterpart schemes ( these are investigated in detail in lord , malham and wiese  @xcite for linear stochastic differential equations ) .",
    "they require the assumption that a sufficiently accurate underlying ordinary differential integrator is used ; that integrator could for example be an ordinary lie group munthe - kaas method .",
    "in the case of two driving wiener processes we derive the order  @xmath55 , and in the case of one driving wiener process the order  @xmath53 uniformly accurate exponential lie series integrators . as a consequence we confirm the asymptotic efficiency properties for both these schemes proved by castell and gaines  @xcite ( see newton  @xcite for more details on the concept of asymptotic efficiency ) .",
    "we also present in the case of one driving wiener process a new order  @xmath56 uniformly accurate exponential lie series integrator ( also see lord , malham and wiese  @xcite ) .",
    "we present two physical applications that demonstrate the advantage of using stochastic munthe - kaas methods .",
    "first we consider a free rigid body which for example could model the dynamics of a satellite .",
    "we suppose that it is perturbed by two independent multiplicative stochastic noise processes .",
    "the governing vector fields are non - commutative and the corresponding exact stochastic flow evolves on the unit sphere . we show that the stochastic munthe - kaas method , with an order  @xmath53 stochastic taylor integrator used to progress along the corresponding lie algebra , preserves the approximate solution in the unit sphere manifold to within machine error .",
    "however when an order  @xmath53 stochastic taylor integrator is used directly , the solution leaves the unit sphere .",
    "the contrast between these two methods is more emphatically demonstrated in our second application .",
    "here we consider an autonomous underwater vehicle that is also perturbed by two independent multiplicative stochastic noise processes .",
    "the exact stochastic flow evolves on the manifold which is the dual of the euclidean lie algebra @xmath57 ; two independent casimirs are conserved by the exact flow .",
    "again the stochastic munthe - kass method preserves the casimirs to within machine error .",
    "however the order  @xmath53 stochastic taylor integrator is not only unstable for large stepsizes , but the approximation drifts off the manifold and makes a dramatic excursion off to infinity in the embedding space @xmath58 .",
    "preserving the approximate flow on the manifold of the exact dynamics may be a required property for physical or financial systems driven by smooth or rough paths  for general references see iserles , munthe - kaas , nrsett and zanna  @xcite , hairer , lubich and wanner  @xcite , elworthy  @xcite , lyons and qian  @xcite and milstein and tretyakov  @xcite .",
    "stochastic lie group integrators in the form of magnus integrators for linear stochastic differential equations were investigated by burrage and burrage  @xcite .",
    "they were also used in the guise of mbius schemes ( see schiff and shnider  @xcite ) to solve stochastic riccati equations by lord , malham and wiese  @xcite where they outperformed direct stochastic taylor methods .",
    "further applications where they might be applied include : backward stochastic riccati equations arising in optimal stochastic linear - quadratic control ( kohlmann and tang  @xcite ) ; jump diffusion processes on matrix lie groups for bayesian inference ( srivastava , miller and grenander  @xcite ) ; fractional brownian motions on lie groups ( baudoin and coutin  @xcite ) and stochastic dynamics triggered by dna damage ( chickarmane , ray , sauro and nadim  @xcite ) .",
    "our paper is outlined as follows . in section  2",
    "we present the basic geometric setup , _ sans _ stochasticity .",
    "in particular we present a generalized right translation vector field on a lie group that forms the basis of our subsequent transformation from the lie group to the manifold . using a lie group action",
    ", this vector field pushes forward to an infinitesimal lie group action vector field that generates a flow on the smooth manifold . in section  3",
    "we specialize to the case of a matrix lie group and using the exponential map , derive the pullback of the generalized right translation vector field on the lie group to the corresponding vector field on the lie algebra . to help give some context to our overall scheme ,",
    "we provide in section  4 illustrative examples of manifolds and natural choices for associated lie groups and actions that generate flows on those manifolds .",
    "then in section  5 we show how a flow on a smooth manifold corresponding to a stochastic differential equation can be generated by a stochastic flow on a lie algebra via a lie algebra action .",
    "we explicitly present stochastic munthe - kaas lie group integration methods in section  6 .",
    "we start the second half of our paper by reviewing the exponential lie series for stochastic differential equations in section  7 .",
    "we show in section  8 how to construct geometric stochastic castell  gaines numerical methods .",
    "in particular we also present uniformly accurate exponential lie series numerical schemes that not only can be used as geometric stochastic integrators , but also are always more accurate than stochastic taylor numerical schemes of the corresponding order . in section  9",
    "we present our concrete numerical examples . finally in section  10",
