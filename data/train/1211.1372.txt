    "the guiding ideology to observe the talbot effect is how to produce a spatial periodical incidence in transverse dimension . from this point of view , it is natural to realize that researchers have created spatially periodic four - wave mixing ( fwm ) and six - wave mixing ( swm ) signals due to the periodic atomic coherence induced by standing waves ( sws ) @xcite , which can play an important role in lasing without inversion @xcite , slow light generation @xcite , photon controlling and information storage @xcite , fiber lasers @xcite , and so on .",
    "the periodic pattern of the multi - wave mixing ( mwm ) signals can be flexibly controllable by adjusting the atomic coherence via changing the beam detunings .    in this article",
