    "the goal of these lectures is to discuss the theory of relativistic real fluids under the excuse of its application to the description of relativistic heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "more concretely , our goal is to discuss , in the simplest possible terms , why the `` einstein elevator '' concept is not useful in the development of this theory .",
    "namely , we can not build a theory of relativistic real fluids by just asking that it reduces to its nonrelativistic counterpart , namely the navier - stokes equations , in an inertial frame where the fluid is at rest .",
    "for this reason we shall begin with a `` derivation '' of the nonrelativistic theory of ideal fluids ( those which flow with no entropy production ) from thermodynamics @xcite . for ideal fluids , the relativistic theory may be found as the covariant extension of the nonrelativistic theory enforced in the rest frame .",
    "we shall then show that already in this simple framework we may obtain a working picture of how a relativistic heavy ion collision works , yielding remarkably accurate predictions regarding several concrete observables .    among these observables",
    "there is the so - called elliptic flow , namely the anisotropy of the particle yield in the transverse plane to the beam direction .",
    "if the matter deposited in the collision region behaves as a nearly ideal fluid , then elliptic flow arises as the simple transduction of pressure gradients in the original configuration into velocities in the asymptotic expanding state .",
    "this is an obvious prediction of the euler equations which is surprisingly hard to reproduce in non - hydrodynamic models . the success in predicting that there must be an elliptic flow is one of the most compelling reasons to believe that matter in the collision region , from some very early time after the actual collision up to the break up in the individual hadrons which are eventually detected , behaves as a fluid .",
    "however , ideal hydrodynamics overestimates the amount of elliptic flow @xcite .",
    "this suggests there must be a mechanism that tends to isotropize flow , and indeed viscosity acts in precisely that direction .",
    "therefore , the next natural step is to consider hydrodynamic models based on real fluid hydrodynamics .    at this point",
    "we return to the formal theory , and generalize our previous `` thermodynamic '' derivation to the case of real fluids .",
    "the resulting non relativistic theory is given by the navier - stokes equations , which is satisfactory , but the relativistic theory emerging from the `` einstein elevator '' is essentially flawed - if covariance is enforced , then the theory has no stable solutions @xcite .",
    "how to get out of this cul de sac is the subject of the rest of the lectures .",
    "since the `` thermodynamic '' approach led us nowhere , we shall begin anew from a more fundamental point of view , that provided by relativistic kinetic theory . in this case",
    ", there is an agreed upon relativistic formulation to build on @xcite .",
    "the problem is how to reduce it to the hydrodynamic level . in the nonrelativistic case ,",
    "the method of choice is the so - called chapman - enskog expansion , which leads to the navier - stokes equations @xcite . in the relativistic case ,",
    "it works likewise , and so it must be rejected .",
    "however , a second well known technique , the grad expansion , is successful in building a relativistic hydrodynamics where linear perturbations of an equilibrium state evolve causally .    however , the application to relativistic heavy ion collisions forces us to face the relationship between kinetic and hydro descriptions a second time , because what is actually measured are individual hadrons .",
    "this means that there must be some space time `` break up '' or `` freeze out '' surface ( or region ) where the fluid nucleates into individual particles that fly away to the detectors ( a process that is by no means simple , but does not belong to these lectures ) .",
    "we must be able to read the one particle distribution function of these particles out of the hydrodynamic state of the fluid just before break up .",
    "if we simple invert the grad expansion , we are led to a one particle distribution function which is not nonnegative throughout phase space , a defect that contaminates the predictions of the theory regarding observables which are sensitive to high momenta .",
    "this drawback of the grad approach , and also the need to include nonlinear corrections to the linearized equations of motion without spoiling stability and covariance , prompted us to suggest that the grad approach may be just the linear approximation to a more comprehensive view of the kinetic - hydro relationship @xcite .",
    "the basic insight is that any realistic kinetic theory displays a whole hierarchy of relaxation times , from the relaxation times characteristic of large scale inhomogeneities to the much shorter relaxation times of hard modes .",
    "fluctuations in the hydrodynamic modes relax on the longer time scales , and are perceived by the harder modes as externally imposed thermodynamic forces which prevent their relaxation to true equilibrium . in other words , the truly kinetic modes relax not to equilibrium but to a nonequilibrium steady state constrained by the instantaneous configuration of the hydrodynamic modes .",
    "it has been known from long ago that such steady states are the solutions to variational problems @xcite .",
    "prigogine among others has proposed that they are the extrema of the entropy _ production _ , as opposed to the extrema of the entropy itself , which are the true equilibria @xcite .",
    "known proofs of the so - called `` prigogine theorem '' are restricted to linear irreversible thermodynamics @xcite ; we shall appeal to it on a heuristic rather than formal basis - the idea is that most kinetic modes are in the linear regime most of the time anyway , so a theory which is good in the linear regime is good enough to compute global observables such as stress tensor components , but we shall not attempt to formulate this insight in any rigorous way @xcite .",
    "we shall therefore conclude these lectures with a brief presentation of this `` entropy production variational method '' , its relationship to positivity of the one particle distribution function , and its nonlinear generalization .",
    "the lectures are organized as follows . in next section",
    "we present the theory of relativistic ideal fluids , as derived from thermodynamics , and its application to the description of relativistic heavy ion collisions ( rhics ) .",
    "the main success of the theory , namely the prediction of elliptic flow , is also its fatal drawback , because experimental data show that ideal hydrodynamics overestimates the flow anisotropy @xcite .",
    "we are therefore motivated to extend the theory to include viscosity , whereby we hit on the stability problem @xcite .",
    "we present the theory of real fluids in section iii ; since the thermodynamic derivation fails , we base our discussion on relativistic kinetic theory .",
    "we must confront the _ closure _ problem , that is , to relate the one particle distribution function in the kinetic description to the hydrodynamic degrees of freedom .",
    "we present the chapman - enskog solution ( which reproduces the results from the thermodynamic analysis , and therefore is unsuitable ) and the grad solution , and finally identify the grad solution of the closure problem as the linearized approximation to an approach based on the entropy production variational method ( epvm ) .",
    "we conclude with some brief final remarks .",
    "if relativistic hydrodynamics may be founded on kinetic theory , kinetic theory itself comes from quantum field theory , the main subject matter of this school .",
    "we show the main lines of the derivation of kinetic theory from quantum field theory in the appendix , which relies heavily on ref .",
    "let us begin by reviewing non relativistic hydrodynamics , as `` derived '' from thermodynamics .",
    "the basic tenets of thermodynamics we need to keep in mind are the following : we have a ( simple ) system described by some intensive parameters ( temperature @xmath0 , chemical potential @xmath1 , pressure @xmath2 , etc . )",
    "whose meaning we take for granted ( e.g. we already know everything about the zeroth law ) and extensive parameters , such as energy @xmath3 , entropy @xmath4 , volume @xmath5 , and particle number @xmath6 ( we use particle number for concreteness , but any , or several , conserved charge(s ) would serve just as well ) . in equilibrium , all these quantities are position independent .",
    "their first deviations from equilibrium are related by the first law    tds = du + pdv -dn [ ( 12.1 ) ] extensive quantities are homogeneous functions of each other , so we must have    ts = u + pv - n [ ( 12.2 ) ] from the differential of this second identity we obtain the gibbs - duhem relation    dp = sdt + nd [ ( 12.3 ) ] where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the entropy and particle number densities , respectively .",
    "this means    .| _ & = & s = t.|_t & = & n [ ( 12.4 ) ] where @xmath9 is the energy density .",
    "let us now consider a non equilibrium , inhomogeneous configuration .",
    "the above relations still hold for the densities of the conserved quantities energy , momentum ( which we must include ) and particle number .",
    "the dynamics is given by the conservation laws    & = & -_j j^ j_u&=&-_j t^ij&=&-_j j^j here @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the energy , momentum and charge densities , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 the respective currents .",
    "@xmath14 must be symmetric @xcite .",
    "the entropy density    s=1 t obeys the first law    tds = d - v_idp^i - dn which implies the gibbs - duhem relation    dp = sdt+p^idv_i+nd in these formulae we have introduced the velocity @xmath16 and the chemical potential @xmath17 .",
    "we therefore have    & = & 1t - v_i-&= & t_j j^ j_u - v_i_j t^ij -_j j^j we then have    = -_j1t+_j(1 t ) -1tt^ij_jv_i - tj^j_j to proceed we write @xmath18 . in the terms involving the velocity we eliminate the gradient of the chemical potential by using the gibbs - duhem relation    & = & -_j1t+_j(1 t ) -1tt^ij_jv_i&-&1tv^j- t^j_j so far    & = & -_j1t&+&_j(1 t ) & -&1t_jv_i- t^j_jusing again the second law , we may write    j^ j_u+pv^j - v_it^ij - j^j - tsv^j = j^ j_u-(+p)v^j - v_i(t^ij - p^iv^j - p^ij)-^j and so    & = & -_j1t&+&_j(1 t ) & -&1t_jv_i-^j_j[dsdt ] where @xmath19 .",
    "since we have allowed for the possibility of the energy and particle number flux not being collinear , we must adopt a convention about what is the fluid velocity .",
    "we shall adopt the so - called landau - lifshitz prescription , namely , that @xmath20 and @xmath21 vanish when @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "we define an ideal fluid as one that flows with no entropy production .",
    "thus for an ideal fluid    t^ij&=&p^iv^j+p^ijj^ j_u&=&(+p)v^j^j&=&0 the symmetry of @xmath14 requires @xmath11 to be proportional to @xmath23 .",
    "the equations for an ideal fluid are thus    + _ j nv^j&=&0+_j ( + p)v^j&=&0+_j p^iv^j+^ij_jp&=&0      we now generalize the above framework of thermodynamics to a relativistic fluid evolving in a spacetime with an arbitrary metric @xmath24",
    ". all derivatives shall be covariant derivatives with respect to the levi - civita connection , so that @xmath25 .",
    "we write the minkowsky metric as @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , where a @xmath29 refers to coordinate @xmath30    to simplify matters we will describe the construction of a covariant theory in terms of a set of rules @xcite :    \\(a ) intensive quantities ( @xmath0 , @xmath2 , @xmath1 ) are associated with scalars , which represent the value of the quantity at a given event , as measured by an observer at rest with respect to the fluid .",
    "\\(b ) extensive quantities ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) are associated with vector currents @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "if a given observer measures a density @xmath34 and a flux @xmath35 for the quantity @xmath36 , then @xmath37 the quantity @xmath32 associated with volume is the fluid 4-velocity ; in minkowsky space    u^=1(1,c ) @xmath32 obeys the additional constraint @xmath38 .",
    "we call density tout court the density measured by an observer comoving with the fluid , namely @xmath39 .    if the quantity @xmath36 is conserved , then @xmath40 .",
    "if we consider the variation of the entropy content within some spatial region as a function of time , the second law demands that the increase in entropy should be higher than the entropy flow through the boundary .",
    "thus the covariant statement of the second law is that entropy production must be positive , i.e. @xmath41 .    \\(c ) energy and momentum are combined into a single extensive quantity described by an energy - momentum tensor @xmath42 which is symmetric . therefore any given observer will identify the energy density as @xmath43 , the energy flux as @xmath44 , the momentum density as @xmath45 and the momentum flux as @xmath14 .",
    "the symmetry of the energy momentum tensor implies that the momentum density is @xmath46 times the energy flux @xcite .",
    "we define the rest frame of the fluid as the frame where the energy flux vanishes . as before ,",
    "the energy density @xmath10 is defined as the energy density in the rest frame .",
    "both the fluid velocity and energy density may be found from the eigenvalue equation @xmath47    let us now describe a relativistic ideal fluid , namely one that flows with no entropy production .",
    "we shall proceed by correspondence between the relativistic and non relativistic theories . to this end",
    ", we assume that in the rest frame we have the decomposition    n^=(n,0 )    t^= (    cc & 0 + 0&p^ij    ) so in an arbitrary frame we must have    n^ & = & nu^t^&= & u^u^+ p^ [ ( 12.11 ) ] where @xmath48 .",
    "the entropy current @xmath31 in the rest frame is given by @xmath49 , where @xmath50 .",
    "in an arbitrary frame @xmath51 or    s^= -t^ _ + pu^ - n^ where the inverse temperature vector @xmath52 and @xmath19 . observe that @xmath53 .",
    "then    s^ _ ; = -_t^_;- n^ _ ; [ ( 12.15 ) ] this means that entropy production vanishes for an ideal fluid , provided the conservation laws of energy - momentum and particle number hold .      the theory of relativistic real fluids has been brought to the limelight by the mounting evidence that one such system has been seen in actual experiments , namely , relativistic heavy ion collisions ( rhics ) .",
    "indeed , one can get a working understanding of rhics from the theory of ideal fluids we have just described .",
    "nevertheless , precisely the demands of a better fit between theory and experiment will prompt us to develop a theory or real fluids , namely , to add viscosity to the flow equations . in this section",
    "we shall briefly describe rhics , and discuss what can and can not be reproduced by models based on ideal hydrodynamics .",
    "rhics have been produced in several experiments , namely the super proton synchrotron ( sps ) at cern , the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) once again at cern .",
    "the rhic experiments in particular are described in detail in the so - called ` white papers ' , which are possibly the most reliable source on the subject @xcite .",
    "one of the goals of the rhic program is to probe into possible new phases of nuclear matter at high energies .",
    "in such a high energy phase , matter is expected to form a plasma of gluons and ( massless ) quarks ( quark - gluon plasma , qgp ) .",
    "virtually all theoretical analysis of rhics assume a space - time picture of the collision provided by the bjorken model @xcite .",
    "the colliding nuclei are seen as slabs of quark and gluon matter . in the center of mass frame ,",
    "both slabs approach each other at near light speed . upon collision",
    ", the two slabs of matter will mostly go through each other , leaving behind a wake of hot plasma .",
    "we may then distinguish three different regions : the two fragmentation regions corresponding to the receding slabs , and the central region corresponding to the plasma in between .",
    "we are interested in phenomena in the central region .    at the time of crossing a number of hard scattering processes",
    "will occur , whose products will reach directly the detectors . these hard processes are unrelated to the nonequilibrium dynamics of the plasma ; and may presumably be predicted on perturbative qcd grounds . in what follows , we will assume this hard component has been isolated despite great difficulty to achieve this in reality .",
    "the hot plasma will expand and cool , and eventually fragment into ordinary particles in flight intercepted by the detectors .",
    "we wish to predict the number of particles of each species to be detected , as a function of the angle @xmath54 between the direction of flight and the direction @xmath55 of the beam .",
    "it is remarkable that with this simple picture we can state a first observable prediction already .",
    "indeed , because of lorentz contraction , we may think of the approaching slabs as infinitely thin in the direction of motion @xmath55 , and in a first approach to the problem , as infinite and homogeneous in the transverse directions @xmath34 and @xmath56 .",
    "this picture is invariant under boost in the @xmath55 direction , and so is the final distribution of particles .",
    "so if we parametrize the momentum of an out - going particle as @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , then the distribution of particles may depend only upon the transverse momentum and @xmath60 .",
    "in particular , it must be independent of @xmath61 since @xmath62 is not invariant .",
    "it is conventional to plot the yield of the collision in terms of the _ rapidity _",
    "@xmath63 , defined by @xmath64 , or rather the pseudorapidity @xmath65 , $ ] @xmath66 rapidity and pseudo - rapidity agree at momenta which are large compared to the mass of the particle .",
    "then the prediction in this picture is that there is a _ plateau _ in the ( pseudo ) rapidity distribution , at least for small rapidity ( @xmath67 corresponds to the fragmentation rather than the central region ) .",
    "although this prediction is not quantitatively borne out by the rhic data @xcite , the experimental curve flattens enough at low rapidity that it may be accepted as a working rough approximation .",
    "we may elaborate the bjorken picture further .",
    "let us assume that the plasma is formed on the plane @xmath68 at the time @xmath69 of the collision , and then expands along the @xmath55 direction .",
    "a given plasma element will cool according to its own proper time @xmath70 .",
    "eventually , at some given constant @xmath70 surface , the plasma will be cold enough ( and/or dilute enough ) to break up into hadrons .",
    "assuming that the product hadrons are thermally distributed , massless and at zero chemical potential , the bose - einstein distribution predicts that the energy per particle is @xmath71 @xmath0 .",
    "since temperature is constant on the break up surface , this means that in all collisions particles should have the same average energy .",
    "indeed , it is observed that the energy per particle is about @xmath72 , regardless of center - of - mass energy and impact parameter .    to obtain a more quantitative description of the process",
    ", we describe the plasma as a relativistic ideal fluid . to close the hydrodynamic system of equations we must provide the equation of state .",
    "the central feature of this is the `` softening '' near the critical point , meaning that the speed of sound @xmath73 as we approach the transition point .",
    "the softening of the equation of state affects the evolution of the fireball , which then becomes a signal of whether the transition point has been reached or not .",
    "since perfect fluids conserve entropy , the total entropy within the fireball remains constant , and @xmath0 scales as @xmath74 so , if the expansion is one - dimensional , and we consider the volume enclosed between two fixed rapidities , then @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the proper time . in particular , the energy density scales as @xmath77 .",
    "we now consider more closely the phenomenon of break - up @xcite .",
    "assume this occurs on a 3-dimensional surface @xmath78 defined by some equation @xmath79 if @xmath80 is a solution , then the normal vector at @xmath80 is @xmath81 , @xmath82 we shall assume that @xmath83 is timelike .",
    "the invariant measure on @xmath84 is given by @xmath85    let us assume that right up to break - up we can describe matter as a perfect relativistic fluid , and as a noninteracting relativistic gas thereafter .",
    "let @xmath86 be the four killing vectors of minkowski space .",
    "then gauss theorem shows that the quantities @xmath87 and @xmath88 are continuous across the break - up surface ( we shall consider only one conserved current , corresponding to , say , the baryon number ) .",
    "these conditions plus the equation of state of the hadronic phase define the energy density , pressure , baryon number density ( or equivalently , the temperature and chemical potential ) and the four - velocity of the hadrons at break - up .",
    "the detailed spectrum is found by assuming that the hadrons are thermally distributed .",
    "the total number of emitted particles is    @xmath89    where the integral is over some @xmath90@xmath91 surface well to the future of the collision . because of gauss theorem",
    ", we may replace the integral by an integral over the break - up surface ( we may have to complete this surface to get a cauchy surface , but the particle density flux will vanish on these additions anyway ) .",
    "but then we may use the matching conditions to express this integral in terms of the particle current before break - up .",
    "we obtain the total number of emitted particles as    @xmath92    in practice , we may wish to smear a little the position of the break - up surface , thus writing the total number of emitted particles as    @xmath93 \\sigma _ { , \\mu } n_{hydro}^{\\mu } \\ ] ]    the total number of particles of species @xmath94 with momentum @xmath95 is    @xmath96 \\delta \\left ( p_{i}^{2}-m_{i}^{2}\\right ) \\frac{\\sigma _ { , \\mu } p_{i}^{\\mu } } { \\left [ \\exp \\left ( -\\beta _ { \\nu } p_{i}^{\\nu } -\\mu_{i}\\right ) -\\varepsilon _ { i}% \\right ] }   \\label{spec1}\\ ] ]    where the temperature four vector and chemical potentials are read out from the ( ideal ) energy momentum tensor and charged currents of the fluid just before break up .",
    "the two basic observables are the total number of particles with transverse ( respect to the beam axis ) momentum @xmath97 , which is usually given in terms of the transverse mass @xmath98 and the elliptic flow coefficient @xmath99 which results from fitting the particle spectrum in the transverse plane to a second harmonic @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the angle measured from the reaction plane .",
    "this is equivalent to considering an elliptic fireball , in which case @xmath102 measures the eccentricity of the ellipse .",
    "the first harmonic is called directed flow , and would represent a shifted spherical fireball in the transverse plane .",
    "the agreement of predictions from hydrodynamical simulations with experimental data is good , provided the simulation is started very early ( earlier than @xmath103 /@xmath104 after the collision ) . if one believes that the validity of hydrodynamics demands ( local ) equilibration , this very short time is somewhat of a puzzle .      of the several predictions of hydrodynamic models ,",
    "elliptic flow is one of the most compelling , because it is hard to match by alternative models .",
    "let us show how elliptic flow arises in hydro models .",
    "let the velocity of the fluid ( with respect to laboratory time ) in the longitudinal direction be @xmath105 .",
    "we may define a longitudinal rapidity    y_l=12 let us take a boost invariant flow in the beam direction as background solution .",
    "then @xmath106 and the longitudinal rapidity becomes identical with the space time rapidity    y_l==12 we introduce milne time @xmath107 and milne coordinates @xmath108 . define @xmath109 .",
    "we find    -_=1-v_^2 introducing the transverse rapidity    y_=12 then @xmath110 and the four velocity becomes    u^=y _ ( , , _ ) or else in milne coordinates    u^=y _ ( 1,0 , _ ) the interval element in milne coordinates is @xmath111 , and so there are nontrivial christoffel symbols    ^_= and    ^_=1 in the strictly boost invariant case @xmath112 we have @xmath113 and @xmath114 , although @xmath115 .",
    "the covariant euler equation is identically satisfied , @xmath116 , while the energy density @xmath117 for conformal matter .",
    "obviously boost invariant expansion can not create elliptic flow .",
    "the next step is to consider a nontrivial dynamics in the transverse plane .",
    "it is convenient to parametrize the transverse plane in terms of lagrangian coordinates @xmath118 .",
    "then the full coordinates are @xmath119 ; the transformation back to euler coordinates is given by the system    _",

    "this simple effect is remarkably hard to reproduce in parton models , under any realistic initial condition .",
    "the important conclusion is that even in this simple model we get a qualitative picture of a relativistic heavy ion collision that serves as a framework for further analysis . in reality",
    "the flow is not really boost invariant , and it is certainly not homogeneous in the transverse plane .",
    "the hydrodynamic models offer a natural way to couple flow to pressure gradients in the transverse plane , and in this respect are superior to all other known alternatives . on the other hand ,",
    "ideal hydrodynamic models overestimate the amount of anisotropy in the transverse flow @xcite ; this underlines the need for a relativistic theory of real fluids to really model relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
