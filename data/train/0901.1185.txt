    "in recent years , much interest and effort have been put into extracting information about two  body interactions from their final state interaction ( fsi ) in production reactions .",
    "to study the final state interaction among multiple final particles rigorously , one in principle needs to solve complicated many ",
    "body equations , where not all of the necessary input is known .",
    "however , if one of the pair  wise interactions in the final state is much stronger than all the others , one may use a simplified method , first introduced by watson  @xcite .",
    "the theorem may be derived from the unitarity relation for two  particle interactions from a production reaction [ eq : eu ] i m ( a_i)=-_k t^*_ik a_k , where @xmath5 is the full production amplitude into channel @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the two - body phase space factor for channel @xmath6 and @xmath8 is the complex conjugate of the scattering amplitude connecting channels @xmath9 and @xmath6 .",
    "here summation over @xmath6 is assumed .",
    "this relation is also called extended unitarity ( eu )  @xcite and has been used in many analyses .",
    "we will also use this phrase in what follows . the case studied by watson was the single channel case . since im@xmath10 is a real number",
    ", it automatically follows then that the phase of the production amplitude equals to that of elastic scattering  this is known as the watson theorem .",
    "then the final state interaction is well described by the jost ",
    "function for the scattering amplitude  @xcite , which for large scattering lengths and small momenta agrees with the scattering amplitude .",
    "however , in many applications , as the @xmath11 decays we will study in this work , the mentioned conditions are not met in the whole kinematic regime .",
    "for example above the @xmath12 threshold coupled channels become relevant . since eq .",
    "( [ eq : eu ] ) contains a summation , there is no connection anymore between the phase of the scattering amplitudes and that of the production amplitudes .",
    "in addition , there might be effects from crossed channels .",
    "those were most recently discussed in ref .",
    "the effects of coupled channels on the mentioned @xmath11 decays were first investigated in ref .",
    "the idea was refined in ref .",
    "@xcite and later improved in ref .",
    "@xcite  especially here the data of refs .",
    "@xcite was included .",
    "crossed channel effects were studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , however , no detailed comparison to the most recent data was performed .",
    "recently , bugg  @xcite argued that the eu is in conflict with experimental data when applied to the case with multiple resonances being present in one partial wave , such as the scalar meson channel .",
    "based on the incorrect assumption that watsons theory was originally derived without overlapping resonances , the author argues that the extension of this theory to describe the scalar meson production , in which @xmath13 ( the so - called @xmath14 meson ) and @xmath15 are present , is not reliable . the central statement of ref .",
    "@xcite is that , since eu predicts the same phase of production amplitude and scattering amplitude ( and he assumes this to be the case even above the opening of inelastic channels ) , analyticity would further require that the relative magnitude of the two resonances should also be the same for both processes .",
    "he then demonstrated that this is in conflict with the pwa results of the @xmath16wave contribution to the @xmath17 invariant mass spectrum in the @xmath18 , where there is no signal of a deep dip around the @xmath19 threshold as it would follow from the reasoning presented above . in this work we investigate , if this observation indeed shows that eq .",
    "( [ eq : eu ] ) is wrong . before addressing this issue",
    ", one should notice that the naive eu as given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eu ] ) only tells us the relation between the production amplitude which only includes the information of fsi of two final particles and the corresponding elastic scattering amplitude of the two particles .",
    "this means that the fsi between these two particles and other hadrons in the final state , which will be called crossed channel fsi in the following , has been neglected .",
    "sometimes , such an approximation can be employed . for instance , for the dipion transition between charmonia @xmath20 , if there is no resonance which couples strongly to @xmath21 or @xmath22 . in addition , the interaction between @xmath11 and @xmath23 and the pions is ozi suppressed and therefore small  @xcite .",
    "however , the situation is different for the @xmath11 decays into three light flavored mesons . for the decay @xmath24",
    ", there is a well - established axial vector meson , the @xmath25 , which couples strongly to both the @xmath26 and @xmath21  @xcite ( certainly the coupling strength of @xmath27 is much larger than that of @xmath28 since the latter is ozi suppressed ) .    it should also be stressed that a linear relation like eq .",
    "( [ eq : eu ] ) is putting a lot weaker constraints on the amplitudes as a non  linear relation like the corresponding one for elastic scattering does .",
    "in particular , the amplitude gets fixed only up to a polynomial .",
    "thus , it is not correct that the requirement of unitarity and analyticity can determine the relative strengths from different resonances as well . on the contrary , based on eq .",
    "( [ eq : eu ] ) there is still the freedom to adjust the relative coupling between different resonances .    the main aim of this work is to demonstrate that the conflict between the experimental data analysis and the result that follows from eu can be largely removed by the crossed channel effects .",
    "here we mainly concentrate on the production of one vector meson and two pseudoscalar mesons in @xmath11 decays where the two pseudoscalars are in relative @xmath16wave .",
    "we follow the ideas and formalisms in refs .  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors constructed the production amplitude from two pieces .",
    "the first part is the coupling of the @xmath11 to a vector meson and a scalar source , and the second part is the coupling of the scalar source to two pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "the latter is described by scalar form factors .",
    "final state interaction is incorporated through a chiral unitary description with coupled channels , in which the scalar mesons ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) are produced dynamically from the @xmath16wave interactions between the goldstone bosons . in this way , it is possible to investigate the ozi violating effect and to extract the low energy constants  ( lecs ) of chiral perturbation theory  ( chpt ) , if scalar form factors are calculated up to next - to - leading order  ( nlo ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite a deep dip appears right above the @xmath19 threshold in the @xmath16wave @xmath17 invariant mass spectrum of the @xmath29 as discussed above .",
    "however , this is apparently in conflict with the pwa results by the bes collaboration  @xcite .",
    "bugg considered this as a signal that eu is wrong .",
    "however , it should be noted that in ref .",
    "@xcite , the ozi violation parameter is assumed to be real .",
    "this means that the contribution of crossed channels was neglected .",
    "in fact , in ref . @xcite the authors have investigated the contribution from those mechanisms . in their work",
    ", the crossed channel fsi are modelled by some three  meson loop diagrams .",
    "it is shown that the contribution of those mechanisms is not negligible .",
    "it is clear that the crossed channel fsi can distort the prediction of the naive eu . after considering those diagrams , it is possible to largely remove the conflict between the prediction of eu and the bes pwa results as will be shown in this paper .",
    "the formalism of our analysis in presented in section  [ sec : form ] . in section  [ sec : res ] , we give the results of our analysis and the parameters from fitting to the data . the conclusion and some discussions are given in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "the experimental data of the @xmath11 decaying into a vector meson and two pseudoscalar mesons are collected in a series of papers  @xcite .",
    "the latest data are published by the bes collaboration in refs .",
    "@xcite where also a partial wave analysis ( pwa ) is provided . in this way",
    "the @xmath16wave contribution of the final @xmath17 and @xmath19 pairs was isolated from the other partial waves .",
    "it is convenient for us to use these pwa results because we can concentrate on the scalar meson channel and avoid the complication from the contribution of other resonances .",
    "hence , our analysis is based on the pwa results  @xcite .",
    "however , it should be stressed that @xmath17 @xmath16wave in the region of interest is only a very small part of the full signal which emerges from interferences of this partial waves with others . as a result ,",
    "the extracted @xmath16wave strength should depend on its assumed phase motion .",
    "we expect that the amplitudes of our analysis will show a different phase motion compared to those used in the analysis so far .",
    "in addition , in the bes analysis some possible tree level resonance contributions were neglected , such as the subthreshold contributions from the @xmath30 ( for @xmath31 ) and the @xmath32 ( for @xmath33 ) , and the contribution from @xmath34 mesons ( for @xmath35 ) as shown in fig .  [ tree ] .",
    "it has been stressed in ref .",
    "@xcite that the contribution from the @xmath30 is important and may have significant influence on pwa result .",
    "this uncertainty also enters our work because our analysis is based on bes pwa result . because of these reasons we do not aim at a high quality description of the data , but only at pointing at possible deficits of previous analyses , especially of ref .",
    "eventually the full data set should be reanalyzed based on improved amplitudes .    usually in pwa only some tree level amplitudes",
    "are constructed , and loop contributions are effectively absorbed into the coupling constants .",
    "this is the reason why in some phenomenological analyses the coupling constants are allowed to take complex values .",
    "but it should be noted that in ref .",
    "@xcite the ozi violation parameter and coupling constant are set to be real .",
    "this implicitly means that the crossed  channel contributions are not included .",
    "however , the diagrams shown in fig .  [ 3mesonloop ] can contribute as stated in the introduction , if the outgoing light meson pairs are in the @xmath16wave .",
    "the formalism we will use to evaluate the mentioned mechanisms follows refs .",
